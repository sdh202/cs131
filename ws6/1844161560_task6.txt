The beauty of this SF epic is that Eisenhorn explores these concepts while providing a blood-soaked action packed thriler of a ride   I just chucked Dune and Starhship Troopers off my bookshelf Eisenhorn deserves  stand alone at the top of the SF heap My best comparison is LOTR This is a definite buy-it-in-hardback-if-you-can-find-it so it can endure the wear of re-reading	2005-10-13

Warhammer 40k universe is very grim dark and compelling  read with other fine series of books written by William King and Ben Counter	2005-07-05
