I almost didn't buy it because I thought It would be too difficult to drag myself through all of the game specific terminology since I don't play the game. I was WRONG. Dan Abnett truly tells a compelling, in-depth, page turner of a story that's 1 part Sherlock Holmes, 1 part Raiders of the Lost Ark, and 1 part Lovecraft's Cthulu. The Eisenhorn Ominbus edition covers all three books and 2 chronlogically organized short stories.   <br /> <br />Inquisitor Eisenhorn is truly a character you can invest in and his tragic flaws only make more him more endearing and believable. This is not a superhero, James Bond series where the main characters always save the day and emerge unscathed. These stories are really about Eisenhorn's transformation as he is drawn deeper and deeper into crossing the line of heresy in his crusade to save humanity from the terrors of Chaos. How much sacrifice is acceptable and can the ends justify the means? The beauty of this SF epic is that Eisenhorn explores these concepts while providing a blood-soaked, action packed, thriler of a ride.  <br /> <br />I just chucked Dune and Starhship Troopers off my bookshelf. Eisenhorn deserves to stand alone at the top of the SF heap. My best comparison is LOTR. This is a definite buy-it-in-hardback-if-you-can-find-it so it can endure the wear of re-reading.	2005-10-13

Where Warhammer was confined by its late medieval setting, 40K gets to indulge a smorgasbord of historical flavours - Imperial Rome, Victorian England, 20th century fascism - while keeping Elves, Orcs and other medieval fantasy staples, only adding spaceships and guns. Hardcore science-fiction buffs may sniff as such quarrying of the past as intellectually lazy and tacky, but that's their loss. <br /> <br />It's this sort of descriptive opulence that makes the Eisenhorn novels worth the read. In contrast to his Gaunt's Ghosts series, which can qualify at a pinch as military fiction, Abnett's trilogy of the plucky Inquisitor can't aspire to the detective genre. He gives us a sequence of events rather than well-defined plot lines leading to a resolution, admittedly a criticism that could be applied to many Sherlock Holmes stories. The trick is that the reader doesn't notice because he (more occasionally, she) is absorbed with the events themselves and the backdrop against which they take place. As Abnett acknowledges in the preface to the one volume edition, the idea was to give readers an insight into the texture of the 40K universe, so often sublimated into the pervasive violence associated with Games Workshop. The `storyline' is Eisenhorn's self-narrated personal journey, which is used to showcase the 40K universe and serve as a metaphor for its moral paradoxes, with liberal doses of bloodshed, psychokinesis and daemonancy thrown in along the way. <br /> <br />An Inquisitor was the obvious choice for this role, not just because he gets to travel but because the Inquisition is the Imperial institution par excellence, its raison d'etre being to root out difference within Imperial society and burn it - sometimes literally - in the name of species survival. The first paradox is obvious: to save humanity one has to crush it, in spirit and often in flesh. The second and connected one is more subtle: to fight the darkness one must flirt with it, a dilemma Abnett achieves primarily through the daemon Cherubael, who despite being more a device than a character and warp spawn to boot is one of the Black Library's more memorable creations. The implications of this ethical impasse aren't pretty. Everything Eisenhorn is attached to as a human being (even his own body) is progressively destroyed, leaving him stalking the shadows alone, or more precisely with an imprisoned daemon for company. The God-Emperor's work is a hard calling. <br /> <br />As expected of a 40K novel, Eisenhorn is not exactly a light read. Occasional scenes of poetic charm and even beauty relieve a sea of grimness, in which most characters eventually die with varying degrees of unpleasantness. It seems to be the First Law of Science Fiction - the more dystopian the universe, the more readers relate to people living in it - and Abnett, who's perhaps better known for his work on the 2000AD (Judge Dredd) franchise, is an old hand at this. I can't think of a novel that better captures the baroque and sometimes frankly disturbing appeal of Warhammer 40000.	2005-07-24

It is also cheaper to buy the larger version than the books individually.   <br /> <br />The writing style of Dan Abnett creates vivid and real characters rich in detail.  Each setting and engagement places the reader into that scene as a participant.  The action and storyline flows in battle against the Chaos that threatens humanity in the Warhammer 40k universe.   <br /> <br />The books starts with one lone Inquisitor and later ends with him having created a full staff, complete with training schools and subordinate Inquisitors.  One can become easily attached to the characters in the series, just like in his Gaunt's Ghost series. <br /> <br />The science fiction world created by Dan Abnett is amazing and I truly prefer his stories over those of the Star Wars universe where main characters were stagnant, \\"evil\\" Imperial forces were destroyed by the thousands and the good guy Republic always triumphed with minimal losses.  I actually have the full X-wing series and many of the original trilogies and mini-series of Star Wars books from the 1990's.  But now, Dan Abnett has become my favorite in Science Fiction and enjoy his writing much more than Stackpole or Zahn.  Both Stackpole and Zahn are also excellent writers, but really do enjoy Abnett's writing more.   <br /> <br />Abnett's characters evolve and some favorites will die in a dark universe where humanity is fighting for its survival.  This is not a book that ends happily ever.  Will humanity overcome the Chaos that threatens or will he fall prey to it in the attempt of learning and fighting it? <br /> <br />Warhammer 40k universe is very grim, dark, and compelling to read with other fine series of books written by William King and Ben Counter.	2005-07-05

Eisenhorn, as the collected works are now known is the quite possibly best of Dan Abnett's work. Originally published as three separate paper-back novels named Xenos, Malleus, and Hereticus this new edition includes the unabridged contents of those three books as well as two \\"arching\\" short stories of about twenty pages that connect books one to two and two to three.  This is an amazingly opportunity.  <br /> <br />Covering a period of nearly three hundred years, Eisenhorn is an epic tale of the far distant future of humanity. The galaxy has been colonized by mankind and is united together in one glorious and dark Imperium that spans nearly forty-percent of the galaxy, untold trillions of human beings spread across thousands and thousands of worlds struggle for survival as the Imperium's tenuous hold on its territory and its way of life is threatened from without and within by forces both malevolent and ancient. Principle among these foes are the insidious taint of warp-spawned daemons and their corrosive chaos that corrupts the very soul of and body humanity, aliens who range from disdainfully arrogant to primordially evil, and the threat of insurrection from within the ranks of humanity itself.  <br /> <br />Set in the Helican Sub-sector, Scarus Sector, Segmentum Obscurus, but a small part of the massive Imperium, Eisenhorn will sweep you away across a region of the galaxy which spans nearly two dozen worlds.  Named for the central protagonist of the novels, Gregor Eisenhorn, this tale follows his life of as Imperial Inquisitor, a man who has the power to devastate worlds and commandeer virtually any of the forces of humanity in his pursuit of the purification of the human race and the eradication of the mutant, the alien and the heretic. It is a tale with more in common with the epic poems of the Norse and Greeks than with modern science fiction for not only does it cover matters military but it has more than its share of, intrigue, desperation, a vast cast of characters, poignant moments of drama, betrayal, hopeless odds, sacrifice and mad hope.  <br /> <br />Abnett's setting and visuals almost leap out of the page and his characterization and storytelling is not only the best in the Black Library but one of the best in genre.  Part Tom Clancy and part Robert Jordon, Abnett's tale of Gregor Eisenhorn from age 30 to nearly three hundred is a magnificent experience both sinister and sublime. You will not be disappointed.	2005-06-15

One such, however, the Black Library, has done its readers a tremendous service--and<br /><br />done it for a terrific price, as well.<br /><br />Dan Abnett is almost universally lauded as the best of GW's stable of writers exploring the grim, dark future of its Warhammer 40,000 universe. While his 'Gaunt's Ghosts' series is probably his most popular, and its gritty,<br /><br />in-the-trenches, on-the-front-lines view of the 40Kverse appeals to readers of both SF and military fiction, his three volume series about Inquisitor Gregor Eisenhorn and the goings-on within the vast Imperium of Man behind those front lines is arguably his best...so much so that the three paperbacks which made up the series--'Xenos,' 'Malleus' and 'Hereticus' (named for three major branches, or<br /><br />Ordos, of the investigatorial Imperial Inquisition which Eisenhorn serves)--quickly sold out and became secondary market collectibles.<br /><br />Readers have clamoured for an omnibus edition of the three under one cover--and the Black Library has now delivered that, with 'Eisenhorn.' They've added to the collection, however, by including an introduction from Abnett outlining the origins of the project, as well as two interstitial short stories otherwise available only in old issues of the much-missed GW fiction magazine 'Inferno!' They've topped it with a terrific cover painting of Eisenhorn by Clint<br /><br />Langley (after Adrian Smith's original); and then they've priced the whole package for little more than a third of what the original novels alone cost, new.<br /><br />This is a tremendous series: if you are a fan of action/adventure, space opera, borderline superheroics, or military fiction (particularly of the 'small band of specialists on a mission' subgenre), you are going to find as much to<br /><br />enjoy as the dark science fiction reader the book is ostensibly aimed at...and if you've an interest in any corner of GW's richly-detailed 40K universe, you will not get a better 'feel' for it than you will here. Abnett draws his<br /><br />characters richly and emotionally, conjures a plot around them over the course of the three novels filled with wonderful small moments and an occasional<br /><br />jaw-dropping sequence (the beginning of 'Hereticus' is so good, you will wonder how its climax can ever begin to equal it), but--probably best of all--never loses sight of the series' real star: the unique universe of GW's 41st millennium,<br /><br />which he never fails to find an opportunity to detail and explore, always convincingly.<br /><br />The three books of the 'Eisenhorn' trilogy are my favorite 40K novels thus far. Having them under one cover is a real 'fanboy' delight, a pleasure increased by the bonuses the Black Library has thoughtfully included. And the price<br /><br />point means I will be able to introduce the Warhammer 40K universe to more than a few friends who do not play the games, but whom I know will enjoy these stories.<br /><br />Well-done, GW. Of course, a limited edition of the collection in hardcover would still be even nicer....<br /><br />Christopher Allen<br /><br />+++ok is ostensibly aimed at...and if you've an interest in any corner of GW's richly-detailed 40K universe, you will not get a better 'feel' for it than you will here.

I was pleasantly surprised at the depth of the characters, the complexity of the story, and the multiple plots Dan Abnett devolves throughout the 800+ pages.<br /><br />Eisenhorn is a compilation of three books.  The continuity of the story and consistency of the characters warrants putting all three under one cover.  I found each book; Xenos, Malleus, and Hereticus quite entertaining.  The entire Warhammer 40,000 universe is based on the monolithic struggle of man vs. machine vs. evil vs. everything else.  The Eisenhorn character is an agent of the empire of man whose primary mission is to stand between the onslaught of evil and evil machines and the countless billions of humans who exist in a quazi-techno hell set in the far future (*breath).  His purpose is to stamp out `Heretics' desire to obtain forbidden technology and the countless incursions of beings from an alternate universe called The Warp.  He is accompanied by several characters throughout the book that are developed in concert with Eisenhorn.<br /><br />If you like to read about a never ending war with death and destruction on this kind of scale then I would think you would enjoy this book as much as I did.  I could barely put it down as I was pulled right into the development of Eisenhorn right from page one.<br /><br />I reccomend this book to anyone who is a fan of Sci-Fi	2005-02-08

The trilogy chronicles the progression of Gregor Eisenhorn from \\"puritain\\" to \\"radical,\\" along with his trusted staff, one of whom - Ravenor - has spawned his own series. <br /> <br />The characters are well developed and engrossing, the \\"sets\\" immersive to the reader, and the plot keeps you turning the pages (and wishing for more). Abnett brings out the best in the Warhammer 40K canonical background, capturing the dark essence of the Inquisition in this case, as he similarly captured the core of the Imperial Guard in the Gaunt's Ghosts series. <br /> <br />In short, this is one of the \\"essential library\\" for any 40K fan, and makes for a good read even if you don't fit into that category.	2005-01-28
