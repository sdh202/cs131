#Original dataset used is amazonshortened.tsv, first 100 lines of full amazon dataset
#As full amazon dataset was very large, I used this shortened one.

# wc -l returns that original dataset has 100 lines:
bash-4.4$ wc -l amazonshortened.tsv 
100 amazonshortened.tsv

# running script with x=80 and outputing to sampled.tsv
bash-4.4$ ./randomsample.sh 80 amazonshortened.tsv > sampled.tsv

#wc -l on sampled.tsv returns 80, correct as 80% of 100 lines = 80.
bash-4.4$ wc -l sampled.tsv
80 sampled.tsv

bash-4.4$ exit
