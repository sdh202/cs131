I really do enjoy this series and Hugh Corbett is my kind of hero.  He's intelligent, silent and keeps his thoughts to himself while he solves the hardest cases for Edward I.  In this one Edward sends Hugh to the Knights of the Templar stronghold to discover just what secrets are going on there.  Hugh and his two companions find a very secretive and dangerous place where people keep dying in a mysterious type of fire that resists water.  The best thing about the series is the history lesson that we get from each book.  Not only do we hear about the Templar movement and some of its history, but we find out where and when gunpowder originated in this book alone.  This book will keep you turning pages until Hugh finally unamsks the killer.  Doherty sents a relentless pace in his books and this one even more so.  Great series!	2005-10-13

This is a most unique book in many ways.  It has the most amazing characters and even though the books is short, Mr. McShane's way with character development ensures that his readers get to know his characters very well indeed.  Little Doom is a tiny village of 15 people in Cornwall, England.  The book begins with poison pen letters, but before the end of the book everyone in Little Doom hates and mistrusts everyone else and four people end up dead.  This is a brilliantly written, laugh out loud mystery, and I heartily recommend it.	2005-10-11

It's finally spring in Crozet, Virginia, but the weather is as unsettled as some of the happenings in this little town.  There appears to be a lot of deaths - one looked like natural causes, one looked like suicide and one was murder, but as Harry and her pals delve deeper into the mire, it appears that the deaths are all connected and they were all murder.  This book moves along at a pretty swift pace, and we have lots of hijinks with the fabulous thres pets as well as more contact with our old friends in Crozet.  This is a great cozy series, and because of that we get to become good friends with the good citizens of Crozet.  But there's sure a lot of crime in this piece of Virginia!	2005-10-10

This is another solid entry in the George Felse series.  We see a great deal of George this time, and that is a good thing.  George is a wonderful character - straight, no-nonsense, and smart as a whip.  The wonderful thing about Ellis Peters books is her wonderful plots and characterizations.  She will take something simple like an old, medieval door and build a tale around it.  This whole story revolves around this old door, and the old door has a lot of secrets to tell.  George is willing to listen to the door and its hidden secrets and is therefore able to solve the case.  We have a nice mix here of an old cold case and two new cases (a murder and an attempted murder).  Ms. Peters weaves them all together seamlessly.	2005-10-06

As you read these stark and beautiful poems you may see into the tortured psyche of the poet who wrote them.  Baudelaire had a short and sad life.  He contracted syphilis at a young age, and this disease plagued him for all his life until he died at the age of 46.  His poetry was written in the mid nineteenth century, and when this book came out in 1857 it shocked the French-speaking world.  In fact the book was banned for a time, and when it did come out again six or seven poems were removed from it.  The edition that I had had all his poetry including the banned ones, and I recommend that if you're interested in great poetry that you get the complete edition.  In his poetry Baudelaire examined evil under a magnifying glass and exposed it for the world to see.  His language and imagery are absolutely beyond belief.  Baudelaire was a very talented wordsmith and his poetry is lyrical an descriptive.  In the cold light of our modern world, Baudelaire's stepping into the world of erotica seems tame compared to what we're used to, but it's easy to see why it shocked everyone at the time.  This is beautiful poetry that will come out and grab your soul.	2005-10-04

There is no mystery at all because we know all along who does the murder and why.  But we have to wade through repetition over and over and Jenny's story is retold.  I lost track, but it had to be at least five times.  I have undertaken to read the entire Miss Silver series, and it has been worth it, up to this book.  Since there is only one left, I will read that as well.  After 30 books, it's something that I should do, but I'm going to find it difficult after this one.  For those of you who haven't read Miss Silver, skip this book, and read some of the others.  Some of them are really excellent.	2005-10-03

This book is proof positive that Dame Agatha Christie did not lose her storytelling skills as she grew older.  This book is one of the final Miss Marple cases, and it is a masterpiece.  It has all the Dame Christie hallmarks - a tight plot, great characters, lots of red herrings and a complex puzzle to solve.  This is a book about a very old murder that is \\"crying out\\" to be solved.  The young couple that have bought the house where the murder occurred are drawn into solving what happened to poor Helen (Gwenda's stepmother as she finds out).  Fortunately they have the good look of enslisting the aid of Miss Marple because this old mystery is still a very real and urgent one to the killer.  It takes all of Miss Marple's skills to determine who did the deed, and we the readers have to wait until the very end of the story for the shocking answer.  Ms. Christie was a true genius of mystery novel writing, and this book is proof positive of that.	2005-10-01

This is such a very powerful series, and with her writing, it's almost as though Ms. Perry has experienced World War I herself.  In this book she gives as fine an example of a navy battle that you'll read anywhere.  But not only that; readers also get a glimpse into what this war did to people and to their emotions, as well as what it did to everyone touched by it(which includes family and friends back home).  And to top all of this off, there is a top-notch mystery to be solved within the pages of this book. This is the third book in this series about the Reavely family.  We do get to know the older daughter Hannah much better in this book, but there is little in the book about the younger daughter Judith in it.  Joseph Reavely, the chaplain, has been injured out of the army for a time, so he is sent back home to recover.  Most of the action takes place in the Reavely hometown of St. Giles.  But even here, far from the front lines, the effects of this terrible war are felt very keenly.  Ms. Perry does a masterful job of showing us just what it was like for those left at home while their sons, husbands, brothers and/or frineds were on the front lines.  I cannot stress enough how important and wonderful this series is, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in some World War I history, or in someone who is a student of human nature.	2005-09-30

When an unidentified lady is found stabbed to death in a locked communal garden, Mrs. Jeffries and her crew are launched into investigating one of the most confusing cases yet.  The ending for this one is a bit of a surprise as well.  And we see Bestsy and her Smythe reach another level in their \\"courting\\".

I absolutely love this series, and this book is a great addition to it.  In it we finally get some very outstanding questions answered, and we also get some unresolved issues resolved.  But the thing that I enjoyed the most about this particular book is that we get a closer look at Emerson!  Yes, Amelia and all her troupe are also there, thank heavans, but getting a closer look at Emerson finally is an added bonus.  We actually see a little of him as a young man and we get an understanding of how he became the man he did.  Reading these books is such a deligbt, and the characters seem like old friends!  And there is lots of heart-stopping action to keep you turning the pages.  This book is set at the beginning of the First World War, and we also get a bit of an insight of some of the dangerous games carried out on the Egyptian front.  I hope that future books will embellish on this a little.  I certainly can't wait to read the next book.	2005-09-21

His Morse series is a reader's dream!  Dexter pens a great story, and the mysteries in these stories are also very good - complex and difficult to solve.  As much as I enjoyed the televesion programs, reading the books has been a delight!  Morse is just as brilliant as John Thaw portrayed him, but he is something more.  He's much more vulnerable, mercurial, quixotic and yes, more eccentric.  He drinks more and lives larger than he appears on TV, and these have an effect on his health.  In this book, we see a vulnerable Morse battling his mortality while he tries to solve a complex case.  He wins the battle this time, but we know that the next book will be his last and that makes reading this book a bitter-sweet experience.  Read this series!  It should not be missed!	2005-09-18

This book is a crowning achievement.  It is certainly much more than a mystery. It is an extraordinary novel with real characters, a great plot and awfulness running through.  As you read the book you know that something terrible is going to happen, but that does not prepare you for the shock of the ending!  It all starts witht the death of a famous novelist, and from there we meet his family - a wife who he barely tolerates and two daughters that he adores.  One of the daughters wants to write a story of her beloved father's life, but as she begins she finds ancient secrets and mysteries that no one in their family dreamt of.  But even then she can't let herself get the whole story, but we the readers are given that story at the very end, and it's a deep and dark place that Ms. Vine takes us to.  This is such a rich novel and it deals with some issues that are still kept in closets and behind closed doors.  Ms. Vine hits us in the face with our prejudices and our pre-conceived notions, and she does it so skillfully.  The book is compelling and totally un-put-downable.  I dare you to read it!	2005-09-15

I did not enjoy this one as much though because there really was not much of a mystery.  We knew almost from the beginning who killed Uncle Jonathan.  But Miss Wentworth's characters are really so wonderful, and that is what is rewarding about reading these stories.  She stereotypes to some extent, but the characters still seem so real.  Her portrayal of young Mirrie is quite wonderful.  In this book Miss Silver is called in when a young woman is accused of killing her uncle when he is found shot dead in his study.  She certainly had motive, but no one believed that Georgina had it in her.  Miss Silver doesn't either and it doesn't take her long to determine who did the shooting.  I'm almost at the end of reading Miss Silver mysteries, and perhaps it's time.  I have enjoyed it, but they get a bit repetitive after a time.	2005-09-11

I had never taken the time to enjoy Yeats' poetry before although I had read single poems on occasion.  It is an experience not to be missed to sit and read his better-known poetry all in one sitting.  The beauty of the words and imagery is then much more apparent.  Yeats writes a lot about mysticism and the occult, and ancient Ireland comes alive as you read his beautiful words.  I read that Yeats, although he wrote poetry all his life, would only put down three or four lines per day.  He was such a perfectionist that he wanted to make sure that his lines were perfect.  It seems such a tedious procss, but what beautiful words he wrote!  His time could not have been better spent than in creating three beautiful and perfect lines per day.  His poetry changed as he aged, but it kept getting better and better.  His earlier poetry portrayed a lot about faeries and the dream world the he lived in himself when he was young.  The lyrics were tuneful and romantic.  As he aged, the romanticism changed considerably and his poems were harder-driven with very deep messages underneath the words.  These are truly masterpieces, and Yeats comes by his reputation as one of the greatest English writing poets of all time.	2005-09-11

There's not much mystery here since its easy to guess who the killer is, but we get another visit with Ms. Brightwell's wonderful characters.  Don't be fooled.  This is a series that is fully on the side of \\"cozy\\".  There's not much historical detail in the books even though they are set in Victorian England.

Their job of delivering their young charge becomes very complicated when she goes missing.  Tossa and Dominic are then racing against time in a strange country in order to try to get her back.

And that is what the citizens of Crozet have become to me.  These books are witty and wise becasue we see human nature so well in her characters.  In this book there are nefarious doings at the Crozet Hospital.  For some reason people affiliated with the hospital keep turning up dead.  It takes some astute detecting by Mrs. Murphy and her two companions to figure out what is going on in the basement of the hospital.

But once the three arrive in the village of Hunstanton, they find it dark and mysterious, and a village that has many hidden secrets.

The victim (mother) of this family is so truly awful, and she rules over her family with an iron fist.  The family lives cheaply and vulgarly, and none of them are accepted in their village.  There's not much mystery here, but the reading is pure pleasure.  We are forced to keep reading, and as we read we shudder and are grateful that maybe our lives aren't as tawdry as this.  This is a wonderful \\"in your face\\" satire.  Even the policeman in charge of the case is an unlikeable stuffed shirt.  Barnard is a real master at characterization, and this book is just too much fun.	2005-08-30

This is a long autobiography, but well worth the effort to read.  There is a reason why it is one of the most widely read autobiographies ever written, and apparently, it was George Elliot's favourite book.  Since I am a very huge fan of George Elliot, this was enough to get me to read the book.  The book is set up in two parts.  Part 1 deals with Rousseau's life up until he was about 30 years of age.  Not only is Rousseau a good writer, he has a very sly wit that keeps cropping up in these pages.  You have to read carefully to catch his wit because it is so understated.  The book is a really good picture of the people that lived during Mr. Rousseau's lifetime.  (1712-1778).  He holds nothing back when he describes what these people did and how they lived.  The book is very sensual, if not licentious, and Rousseau holds nothing back.  It is truly an intimate look at Rousseau and the many people that he came in contact with during his lifetime. We get a first-hand and very intimate at him - his life, his loves, his sins, his friendships, his enemies and his many hardships.  A truly great man, and a truly great autobiography	2005-08-28

I was finding Agatha getting a tiny bit tiring after the last book, but Ms. Beaton has breathed new life into her with her running her own detective agency.  For one thing, Agatha does not have as much time to feel sorry for herself because she's busy solving cases.  We are also treated to some wonderful new characters in this book.  Harry is an absolute marvel!  Ms. Beaton does such a good job with her characters!  In this book Agatha is involved in trying to solve three seemingly unrelated murders, and her and her army of helpers are kept busy trying to keep on top of all three cases.

It seems like Gash is trying to make Lovejoy even scruffier and even more scattered, and the book loses by this.  I still like this series though, and will continue to read until the end.

Watching the antics that Amelia and her brood get into is so entertaining.  There are a number of years between the action in the previous book and this one, but not a lot has changed.  Ramses appears to have spent quite a bit of time roaming around on his own, and he has matured quite a bit.  Amelia and Emerson are just the same, and they are as hilarious as usual.  If I have any complaint it is with the character of Nefret.  As much as I love all the other characters in this series (and they are all like old friends to me after reading all the books up to now), I just can't get myself to like Nefret.  Her character does not ring as true as all the others.  She is a spoiled little girl who tries to act like Amelia, and fails miserably at it.  Anyway, this book is full of the usual villains, forgeries, tomb robbers and assassins.  There is enough action to keep any reader happy.

Miss Marple is on vacation there for two weeks, and she is trying to relive some old memories of staying there with her aunt when Miss Marple was a child.  At first it seems like not much has changed, but Miss Marple's excellent powers of observation show her that all is not as it seems in the grand old hotel.  Just how bad things are, she doesn't at first realize, but then a doorman gets killed in a \\"pea-soup\\" fog.  Miss Marple realizes that evil walks the old hallways of the hotel.  There are some great characters in this book, and the story is quite complex.  Before we're done we have a major crime syndicate uncovered, and it's a surprise to find out who is the mastermind behind this crime gang, and it's also a surprise to find out how they've been operating for so long.  Nothing is too complicated though for Miss Marple and for Chief Inspector Fred Davy.  This book is a pretty good representative of a Miss Marple mystery, and I'm surprised that I had not read it before this.	2005-08-11

The Morse series is an extremely intelligent and wonderfully written series.  This book is one of the stronger ones in a series of very strong books.  Nothing prepares you for the denouement in this book - not even if you've seen the serialized version from BBC.  It is powerfully written and hits with an explosive power.  In the book Dexter explores the female psyche and does a very good job of depicting the power of female friendships.  He also does not hold back any punches when it comes to revenge for past wrongdoings and the effects that evil people have on the people that they are in contact with and live with.  It starts with the murder of a College Don, but the case leads Morse down a winding and tortuous path that exposes the power of hate and retribution.  On the way he even finds love, and the way that Dexter depicts this fresh blooming love is memorable in the simplicity in which he describes it.  It's like watching an unfolding flower.  This is a great novel, and I highly recommend this entire series.	2005-08-09

Ms. Wentworth has done a marvellous job of setting a scene and of outlining some unforgettable characters.  She also proved why she was called the queen of the British country house mystery.  This is as fine an example of this type of story as any that she wrote.  In this book we have the cunning and intelligent Miss Silver pitted against a strong male character, and Miss Silver does not come off the worse in any of their heated exchanges.  The premise for the book is also a good one.  It all starts when a deaf woman lip-reads about a theft and a murder plot while she is sitting in an art gallery.  Her unease about what she has seen brings her to Miss Silver, and from there Miss Silver manages to have herself in residence where she thinks that more crimes will occur.  And she as always is not mistaken.  This would be a good book for novices to the Miss Silver mysteries to get started reading the many books in this series.	2005-08-07

Her books are funny and her characters are like old friends.  It's hard to believe that the time these books are set in is around 75 AD.  Her characters are Roman, and they travel around the world.  Not only do we get a history lesson, but we also have a travelogue for Europe in this time.  In this book, Falco and his wonderful wife Helena (as well as a few other hangers-on) travel to Greece to solve a mystery.  Greece is the home of the Olympic Games and we learn quite about these very early games from the narrative in the book.  Falco is on one of his most puzzling cases ever.  He has to separate the natural deaths and accidents from the murders.  He manages to straighten this out, but he still has no proof to charge his main suspect with the murders of a young married couple on holiday with Seven Sights Tourist company.  We have the privilege of following Falco through the Greecian countryside as he tracks his killer.  I highly recommend this series, and suggest that it be read in order.  This is the eighteenth book in the series, so you'll have a wonderful reading journey to get through.  Be prepared to laugh out loud many times as Ms. Davis' humour runs rampant through each book.	2005-08-05

No one can create an atmosphere of tension like Ms. Rendell writing as Barbara Vine.  I know as soon as I begin one of her books, that I'm on an unstoppable ride until the very last pages.  This particular book is wonderfully written, and there's a nifty little surprise at the end.  The best thing about Barbara Vine is the way she unfolds her plots, and weaves past and present together so it's hard to tell where one ends and the other begins.  She also has an uncanny way of building the scene for her books, so that readers feel that they are right there where the usually horrible act occurs.  The fun is in the unravelling of the mystery.  In this book we have five young people spending an idyllic summer at a grand country estate.  Irrevocable occurences happen during this summer of 1976 which come back to haunt these people almost eleven years later.  Tensions and stress build and build until the final shocking ending.  Great stuff!	2005-08-01

This is another solid entry in the Mrs. Jeffries series.  These little books are lots of fun to read.  It's a series that warms its way into a reader's heart.  The characters are lovable, and as you read you feel that you really get to know them.  They are all quick reads, and are a wonderful way to spend a rainy afternoon.  In this book the staff at Upper Edmonton Gardens are pursuing two mysteries - a disappearance which may be a kidnapping or a murder, and an actual murder.  Are these two seemingly unrelated incidences connected?  We also find out a little about the art world as we watch Mrs. Jeffries and her crew unravel these mysteries. These books are such a lot of fun.	2005-07-26

Ms. Paretsky is a novelist as well as a detective story writer, and her characters are great!  In this book Vic is back in her old South Chicago neighbourhood.  Not only does it bring back childhood memories, but she finds that some old rivalries are still fresh in some of her former acquaintenances heads.  Nothing much has changed in South Chicago she finds.  Vic is coaching a girls' basketball team at her old high school, and finds herself embroiled in some neighbourhood wrongdoings that put her and some of her friends in a great deal of danger.  She has to deal with some of her own demons as well as she tries to unravel what's going on in South Chicago.  She even gets set up against the most powerful and rich South Chicago family.  One that doesn't seem to stop at new lows in order to make that almighty buck.  I highly recommend this series to anyone that loves good stories written by a master hand.	2005-07-25

I found that the book was almost textbook style, especially with the descriptions of bone and DNA science.  There was an attempt to mix a very old past mystery with a new one, but I didn't think it really gelled.  I also found the characters rather stiff and unbelievable.  I usually love the Tempe Brennan series, so was disappointed with this one.  In the book we have Tempe and Ryan travelling to the Holy Land in order to unravel a very ancient mystery, and to see how it relates to a very recent murder back in Canada.  I think Tempe and her buddies do much better when they stick to their home turf.  Let's hope we see her in Montreal or in North Carolina next time out.	2005-07-20

In it we have Albert of course and his wonderful wife Amanda as well as his young son Rupert.  Of course the wonderful Lugge is there too.  In the book Albert and Amanda are invited to a friend's big pary, but before the first glass is drunk there are two deaths.  One of them is an old dear friend of Campion's and he's not satisfied the death was natural causes.  There isn't much of Campion's underworld in this book, but it's a nice tight little mystery with a lighter touch.  Ms. Allingham's writing is as always clear and concise.  All in all, not a bad way to spend an afternoon.	2005-07-15

I was getting a little bored with Stephanie Plum and the destruction that she causes, but this book returned my faith in this funny, rollicking series.  In the book, Stephanie is having a career crisis.  She's tired of being a bounty hunter and attracting all kinds of crazies to her world.  But, guess what?  Even though she thinks she's quit her job, she's still got crazies going after her.  And she's still got to decide between the two \\"hot\\" men in her life.  I don't know about Stpehanie, but I'm all for the black-clad Ranger.  These books are some of the funniest you'll find out there, and this one caused me to laugh out loud numerous times.  I highly recommend this series for good laughs (and there's always a mystery thrown in).	2005-07-12

I absolutely love Child's shotgun style, and Reacher is definitely my favourite character in the thriller genre.  Child's pared-down writing style makes his books beg to be read quickly. And Reacher is the quintessential tough guy.  He's always one step ahead of everyone else, including the bad guys, and he's not afraid of a fight in a good cause.  In this book Reacher gets mixed up with some Russian bad guys who will stop at nothing to achieve their goals.  There's a lot about snipers in the book, and that is incredibly interesting.  We also get to meet some wonderful secondary characters.  I particularly like the ex-marine Cash in this one.  A guy right after Reacher's own heart.  They are almost like two sides of a coin.  Child excels in describing these \\"Buddy-scenarios\\".  But Reacher never hangs around with any of them afterwards.  He's always on his way to his next adventure.	2005-07-10

I found this book a little slower paced than most of the books in this series, but it was still a pretty good story.  In the book we have Lincoln and his team taking on the protection of a young teenage black girl whose life is in danger.  This protection takes them onto an old mystery (140 years old to be exact).  Lincoln and Sachs are dealing with a hit man that wants to silence the girl they're protecting, and he's a particularly crafty hit man because he leaves no trace wherever he goes.  Why is he after 16 year old Geneva?  A number of false leads and trails set by this man have Lincoln's team running around New York. As usual there are wonderful forensics and Lincoln is his usual brilliant self.  Not too bad for summertime reading.	2005-07-06

Maybe I've been reading too many Miss Silver books lately, but I found this book long for the story that was being told.  I also got tired of the wishy-washy women that Miss Silver comes across.  Althea is lack-lustre character, and Mrs. Blount is almost too cowed to be believed.  But there are other good characters in the book.  The three Pimm sisters are quite wonderful (your typical English village busybodies).  And there is Miss Silver and her dear friend Frank Abbot.  A very tiresome woman is found dead in her summerhouse or gazebo, and it's up to Miss Silver to find out the real motive and the real killer.  Kind of ho-hum actually, but some of the characters pull this book out of doldrums.	2005-06-24

Each book, as I've been reading my way through this series, seems to get better, and this one is one of my favourites so far.  I love the characters in this series, and that's what makes it so special.  In this book a woman is killed in her own drawing room, and at first it looks like she surprised a burglar.  But when Chief Inspector Witherspoon comes onto the scene, he feels that it's more a case of cold-blooded murder.  His staff thinks so too, so they begin investigating in order to \\"help\\" their dear inspector.  Although the murderer is no big surprise, the time it takes to get there in the book is a lot of fun.  This is a wonderful cozy, Victorian series.	2005-06-23

Ellis Peters was a great storyteller, and this book is a fine example of her wonderful work.  The story is about a missing cellist from an English traveling orchestra.  The cellist has been missing for 13 years, but events happen that bring his story to the forefront.  The story is set in the Austrian Alps, and George Felse and his wonderful wife Bunty are there trying to figure out a mystery.  This old disappearance seems to be linked to some modern day crimes, and George wants to follow the thread until he uncovers the long-hidden secret.  The book is packed with action, and it will keep you guessing until the end.  Ms. Peters knew how to pace a plot to keep her readers quickly turning the pages.  Her characterizations are also flawless.  If you love the Brother Cadfael series like I do, I suggest that you read the George Felse series as well.	2005-06-22

This was the first time I'd read a book by this Canadian author, and I was very impressed with Mr. Blunt's writing and plotting skills.  We have two very likeable police partners in this series - John Cardinal and Lise Delorme.  The book is set in Algonquin Bay, Ontario, Canada (250 miles north of Toronto).  John and Lise have a different type of mystery to solve.  A young woman is discovered walking around acting strange, and she doesn't remember who she was.  It is discovered that she has a small-calibre bullet in her brain.  Then bodies start turning up.  One is particularly gruesome.  The body of a biker from a local gang is found minus his head, hands and feet.  Mr. Blunt gives us a good insight into forensic entomology as Lise and John try to solve what appears to be ritualistic killings.  They are up against a particularly odious killer in this one.  This appears to be a great series, and I intend to read the previous two books in this series soon.	2005-06-22

It is set in 1302, and Hugh and his squires are found in Nottingham beside the famed Sherwood Forest.  They have been commissioned by King Edward to apprehend the Sherwood Forest thieves led by Robin Hood.  It's fun to read this story set around an almost mythical historical figure, and as always. Mr. Doherty uses his extensive historical knowledge to make an exciting story around true historical happenings.  I truly recommend this series to anyone who is fond of medieval mysteries.  The books are fast-moving, although somewhat bloody, and it's always a pleasure to follow the brilliant Hugh Corbett's thinking processes as he unravels mystery after mystery.	2005-06-20

Right from the beginning, the police don't see a crime, but a mild-mannered teacher doesn't follow along with this theory, so he investigates the crime by himself.  The plot is tight, and it keeps you guessing until the end.  There is still the satire on the stories of detection popularized in the Golden Age.  If you like your mysteries with a liberal sprinkling of British humour, and you don't take them to seriously, Robert Barnard is the author for you.	2005-06-14

She writes intelligent and complex books that make the reader really think.  They are also addictive. This book is even more complex than most.  It's an historical mystery written in the light of the present day and she weaves back and forth from the past to the present almost effortlessly in the book.  This is a very original way to approach solving an ancient mystery or secret.  We have a modern-day biographer that delves back into his own family history and finds some dark and ominous secrets, and as this modern-day author discovers more and more information about his forbears, the more appalled he becomes.  We also have parallel story lines with family lives and births and deaths mirrored from the past into the present day into this author's own personal life.  A very complex tale that is well worth the effort.	2005-06-13

This latest in the Mrs. Murphy series is one of the best for awhile.  In it we see Harry and her friends planning for a 20th School Reunion.  Someone else is planning to make a splash at this reunion.  This person hopes to leave a mark by killing off the Class of 1980 one by one.  Does this person have a motive  for killing certain people, or is it just random acts of violence?  There are a large number of deaths in this book, but that adds to the excitement, but if people in Crozet keep getting murdered, there soon won't be anyone left.  I love the characters, both animal and human, in this series, and am happy that I still have a few more Mrs.Murphy adventures to read.  Murphy, Pewter and Tucker are wonderful (and they're pretty good sleuths too).	2005-06-08

She doesn't show up until 3/4 of the way through the book, and she doesn't have much to say or do in the pages of the book, although she does her thing outside of the pages, and we hear about it second-hand.  We have the required setting for a Miss Marple mystery - a small village where all kinds of personalities are at play.  And in this seemingly quiet village, we have some very nasty poison-pen letters being sent to almost everyone in the village.  There is a suicide then, and after that a murder and this shows that something is not right in Lymstock.  The book is carefully plotted and the characters are pure Agatha Christie, but I found the lack of Miss Marple rather off-putting, so I can only give this a 3.	2005-06-01

This is a quick-moving little book that keeps you guessing almost up to the end.

This book is particularly obscure and requires some concentration.  There is also a huge cast in the book, and it's difficult to keep everyone straight.  But, having said that, it's still worth the effort, but I wouldn't recommend this book for first time Lovejoy readers.  In it we have Lovejoy sold at a charity auction as \\"Slave for a day\\".  He is sold for a huge sum, and he's not sure what's expected of him at all.  He actually ends up in a horse-drawn caravan with a bunch of mentally challenged people as they make the trek to Wales to move into a new hospital.  The antics of this group as well as the other \\"trevies\\" (travelling people in buses and trailers) are quite hilarious.  We get a glimpse of Wales as no one else can depict it, as well as a good history lesson from Lovejoy as he explains the origins of the many antiques that he encounters.  As I said, still worth the effort.	2005-05-25

The book tells the tale of a family that is held together by secrets and skeletons in the closet.  It's an eerie book that delves into the complex relationships that develop in families, and in this case specifically between two half-sisters.  Things that would have wrecked reputations and caused scandals in the forties and fifties in England would not necessarily raise eyebrows in the present day, but so much was kept secret back then, and these secrets split families apart. They also caused major dissensions within families which sometimes ended tragically as this one does.  The genius of Ms. Vine is that she slips back and forth from the past to the present through the eyes of her storyteller, Faith, and she does it so very well.  Readers will remember this book and its haunting tale long after they have closed the covers.	2005-05-18

This book is enjoyable and fun like the rest in this wonderful series, but it does not do well as a \\"stand-alone\\" novel.  There are too many things that have gone on in previous books that keep cropping up in this one for someone who is new to the series to be able to understand and to enjoy the book as it  should be enjoyed.  This is a wonderful series and each of the books in it are great in their own right, but in order to be fully appreciated, the series should be read as a series and in order.  This allows for the maximum enjoyment of each installment.  That way the reader can see the relationship between Amelia and her Emerson develop, they can watch the children as they grow up, and understand each of these characters fully.  Besides, it's such great fun to read these books.  I can always hardly wait for the next one.  This book was set in 1907, and it takes place in The Valley of Kings where Amelia and Emerson have been excavating for a number of seasons already.  The mystery and the adventure are exciting, and we see some of the Emersons' previous villains appear in this one.  What I really enjoyed though was Ramses and seeing the man he has become.  He is going to be a formidable presence in upcoming books.	2005-05-16

As all the books in this series, this one is extremely well-written.  The plot is tight and the mystery will keep you guessing until the end.  Dexter's writing and his Morse series are top drawer.In this book we have the mysterious disappearance of a Swedish student.  (Quite a beautiful Swedish student to all accounts).  Morse is on holiday, but finds that he can't just relax and take time off.  His agile brain needs something to work on and the appearance of some strange verses in the Times appear to fit the bill.  The verses are a riddle about the Swedish student that disappeared in Oxford about a year ago.  These books are so intricately written that it is difficult to write a review without giving away some of the surprises, so I will say no more about it.  I will recommend though, that you read this series from the beginning.  As good as the television series was, these books should be read in order for us to appreciate fine writing in the detection genre.	2005-05-11

Jack London knew how to tell a story, and this book is a page-turner.  Not only that, it has some of the best descriptions of sailing one of the old \\"tall ships\\" I've ever read.  There is a chapter in the book that is a superb description of sailing one of these ships in a bad storm.  Mr. London's descriptions of this and other catastrophic events at sea is so realistic that the reader sees it all as he or she reads it.  London's political ideology does show through in spots.  London was a firm believer in Socialism, and he does put forth these ideas at times in the book.  His villain - Wolf Larsen, is the most evil man you'll ever encounter between the covers of a novel.  The development of Humphrey from an ineffectual, bookish type of man, to a man that can subsist on his own wits and by the actual use of his own hands is the common thread that runs through the book.  Even though he is in close proximity to the evil Larsen, Humphrey does not let Larsen's depravity change his own morals and his own essential goodness.	2005-05-09

This tenth book in the Kate and Charles Sheridan series deals with the problem of terrorists (or anarchists as they were called then) in England.  Apparently in 1902, during the reign of Edward VII, there was fear of this type of violent action.  England has just retreated from the Boer War, and they find that their \\"Jolly Old\\" is full of foreigners, and surely some of those foreigners must be dangerous!  This book is not a mystery story at all.  The only death is an accident when a bomb actually blows up the person who was carrying it.  It appeared that the bomb was meant for the King and Queen on his Coronation Day.  Charles is asked by his King to find out if there is a real anarchist threat, or whether or not this was an isolated incident.  The characters are pretty good, and Kate and Charles are delightful as always.  Also the writing team of Bill and Susan Albert (pseudonymously knows as Robin Paige) have done their homework.  They do a good job of providing enough historical detail, and actual historical people (in this case the American author Jack London), to make the story interesting.  This wasn't a bad effort in my mind.	2005-05-06

This is the first Robert Barnard book that I've ever read, and I can't believe that I haven't sampled this author before this.  He tells a wonderful satirical story and he does it with wit and cutting edge writing skills.  This is apparently one of his earlier books, so I do think that I will be sampling some more of his work after reading this one.  His nasty characters are many and varied, and he describes them in such a cunning and scathing manner that the reader almost gets to like them.  We certainly get to know what makes these characters tick anyway.  In this book a very obnoxious mystery writer by the name of Sir Oliver Farleigh-Stubbs is murdered dramatically in his home with his \\"loving\\" family all around.  When Chief Inspector Meredith arrives on the scene he finds a surfeit of possible murderers.  It seems that there were a lot of people that would like to see this writer dead.  In the course of his long and varied career, he had managed to upset and anger many people.  But Meredith has to sort through the motives and alibis, as well as find a missing manuscript that may hold the key to the murder that was committed.  This is a very deft and well-written mystery story.	2005-05-05

I always look forward to these books, and this one did not disappoint.  China and her friend Ruby are pulled into an old murder that seems to tie up with a new one.  Brian, China's fourteen year-old stepson, finds the remains of a skeleton on an archeological dig.  This skeleton, though interesting, has no historical significance becasue it had only been in the cave for about thirty years.  It turns out that the body found had been shot, and China and Ruby, each being extremely curious, are trying to identify the body.  The identification leads them on to a newer, fresh lead and before long they are on the tail of a cold-blooded murderer.  I love these books for the characters, and also for the interesting information about herbs that Ms. Albert literally sprinkles in with the book.  China never disappoints.	2005-05-04

In this book we see Lovejoy visiting France and Zurich as he gets involved with some really bad people who are part of a much larger syndicate that doesn't appear to want to stop at anything to get their wishes.  Nobody can describe greed like Gash, and it's here in this book, front and centre.  We still have the same loveable scoundral, Lovejoy with his very \\"elastic\\" morals and sexist attitude, but he does stop at murder, and he doesn't stand for human injustices.  This is what makes his such a likeable, if shady, hero.  This book is particularly fast-paced, and the stakes are high as Lovejoy bumbles his way to finding and punishing these villains. I cannot stress enough how entertaining this whole series is.  And we learn so much about history and antiques while enjoying ourself with the stories.	2005-05-03

Margery Allingham's Albert Campion has been one of my very favourite sleuths for a long time.  I can't believe that I missed reading this book when I was making my way through the entire bibliography!  Ms. Allingham can tell a story, and this book will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout.  In it we find Mr. Campion at a great disadvantage because he wakes up in hospital after a bump on the head, and he does not remember who he is, or why he has this sense of urgency that he needs to prevent a major disaster.  He can't tell anyone his problem because he finds that everyone is counting on him to save the day, so he must muddle through and try to make sense of what is going on.  We are faced with blinds and double-blinds, and the reader is kept guessing throughout just as much as poor Campion.  What a wonderful story!  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and would recommend this to anyone who has not experienced the genius of Ms. Allingham before.	2005-05-01

Do you know what I think the best thing about this mystery series is?  Justin de Quncy is only 21 years old.  That means that there should be lots more of these great stories in store!The de Quincy series is a great medieval series because Ms. Penman so intricately weaves historical facts in with her own creative facts, and she has a cast of characters that are unforgettable.  This book has lots of twists and turns and takes our hero, Justin all over the place.  He's in Brittany, France, London, and back and forth again.  Even though Justin is \\"the Queen's man\\", he has been recruited by her least favourite son John to help him out of a tight spot.  de Quincy does not trust John, but he feels that in his Queen's absence, he must do what he can to help this Prince of Darkness.  He is also teamed up with one of his least favourite people on his quest to find a forged letter that has been circulating.  So Justin and the Knight Sir Durand set out to track down the letter that states that John plans to kill his brother, King Richard the Lionheart.  Ms. Penman's gift is that she makes these ancient political machinations and her characters' passions so real to us in today's world. At least, they certainly are to me.  She deals it up with wonderful, believable characters, a fast-paced plot with many unexpected twists and authentic period details.  I can't wait for the next de Quincy.  (And she promises in her \\"Author's Afterword\\" that there will be more).	2005-04-29

This particular series of Anne Perry's is a long-running one and a very good one, and this particular book surpasses some of the later ones even though those were good as well.  It is easy to see after reading this book why Ms. Perry is a master of her particular genre.  Her books are faultless, and the suspense that she creates in her world is unrelenting.  This book has enough espionage, anarchy, murder and bluffs and double bluffs to keep even the most jaded reader's interest.  I cannot stress enough how good this series is, and Ms. Perry continues to get better and better.  In this book we see Pitt partnered with one of his sworn enemies in order to stop full-scale police corruption.  He knows all along the danger that he is in by playing this double hand, but the alternative is one that Pitt cannot let happen, so he teams up with Voisey, who he so neatly check-mated in the last book.  Voisey is a very dangerous enemy to have, but Pitt adheres to the adage \\"Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer\\".  Pitt is still working with Narraway in Special Branch, and this special group is trying to stop the deadly bombings that are occurring in London.  At first glance it appears that known anarchists are responsible for these bombings, but as Narraway, Pitt and Tellman continue in their investigation, they uncover secrets and corruption that go deep into the highest echelons of the police service.  But this anarachy plotline is only one of the plotlines or balls that Ms. Perry so expertly juggles. She tosses out a lot of plotlines as well as some red herrings, and then carefully brings them all in to a final, satisfactory conclusion at the end book.  And she does this without dropping one ball.	2005-04-27

For example, the coporate espionage line kind of fizzles out, and with that drop out an interesting line of enquiry is lost.  As a matter of fact, Miss Silver is sent to Hazel Green to examine the extent of this espionage, and it doesn't appear that she even gives it a thought, let alone try to investigate the angle.  But there are still some interesting characters, both bad and good, and Miss Silver is her usual unflappable self even under extreme stress.  The book is OK, but not one of my favourites.  And, I really didn't like the fair Rosamund.  She's too meek mannered to be believed, and certainly doesn't make a very lasting impression on the book like a female heroine is supposed to.  We need someone with a lot more spunk to even out the story, and in order to have a strong foil for the really bad person in this book.	2005-04-26

This is a wonderful story in the George Felse series, although we see very little of George this go round and a great deal of his marvelous wife, Bunty.  In this one Bunty is on her own while George is in London following a lead.  While she is being maudlin about her forty-first birthday, she gets thrown into the adventure of her life.  She meets a distraught stranger in a pub on Saturday night, and she finds herself caught up in a truly terrifying situation.  The action of the book only takes place over 24 hours, but there is enough action jam-packed in that 24 hours to keep the reader turning pages.  We're talking about murder, kidnapping, organized crime and a whole slew of lesser things.  And Bunty slides through it all in her usual inimitable fashion.  Of course the writing is pure Ellis Peters, and the book is a delight!	2005-04-23

The animals figure this one out, but not the humans, when all is said and done.  It's a pretty good story, although quite easy to figure out as you read.  But that's not why I read a Rita Mae Brown book.  I read for the sheer coziness of the stories, as well as the wonderful characters that she has created (both humans and animals, of course).  I also enjoy the settings behind each story. The area of Crozet, Virginia must be very beautiful, and Ms. Brown portrays it well.  I also like the ideas behind each story.  This one is created around a Civil War reenactment.  I have always been fascinaed with the passionate players that keep this terrible war alive.  The story starts with a prominent citizen being shot in the reenactment.  How can that be, Harry wonders?  They're supposed to be playing and not using live rounds.  Anyway, that is enough to get Mrs. Murphy, Pewter and Tucker going.  They just have to figure it out, while making sure they protect their human at the same time.  Lots of fun.	2005-04-22

This is a review for three of Euripides' plays - \\"Medea\\", \\"Hippolytus\\" and \\"The Bacchae\\".  If you are interested in Greek tragedy, you must read some of Euripides' plays.  His work is as different as can be from some of the others (like Sophocles and Aescylus.)  Contrary to these other two, Euripides did not abandon the religious view of life, but he redirected it and found the values which evoke reverence in spheres other than in moral spheres.  The moral sphere, in his view, belonged exclusively to man.  The gods, according to Euripides, are not man's friend, nor enemy, nor moral guides.  They are the unchangeable facts of existence like sun, wind, rain, the sea and fire.  He also has very definite views of the place that women must keep in society, and he states in no uncertain terms that they should not rise above their station.  In \\"Medea,\\" we are introduced to a complex and dynamic heroine villainess. She takes us through the whole gamut of human emotions.  We see how she reduces the masculine elements to nothing in this play in her handling of Jason.  In \\"Hippolytus\\" we see a wrong committed by one man against another and it results in true repentance and forgiveness.  We also see another strong female character in Phaedra, and Euripides presents her sad case with truth and candor.  \\"The Bacchae\\" is my favourite of the three, and it is a complex and disturbing drama.  We get a good look at Euripides' ideas of what a god is like in his portrayal of Dionysus.  We see how the gods are driven past all reason to achieve justice for past slights.  There is no forgiveness in this play.  I would love to see this play acted.  It would be stunning.	2005-04-20

I have long been a fan of Elizabeth George and her Lynley and Havers mysteries.  My sister got me started on this great  series, and I in turn got my mother going on it.  These books are truly wonderful, but this one is something else!  We still have the finely drawn characters, and the stormy friendship that is between the two main characters.  We also get to spend a lot of time with Barbara Havers, and this is a good thing!  She has always been my favourite character - her with her bad clothes, chopped up hair and brilliant mind.  We also have the wonderful great plot, and the exploration into the psychic mind of a serial killer that only Ms. George can do.  But we also have a truly poignant, sad and shocking tale.  The crimes in the book are sad - a number of adolescent boys are found dead and artfully placed around London.  Lynley and his team have their work cut out for them trying to find this sick, but intelligent murderer.  While searching throughout the streets, byroads and organizations in London, a totally devastating tragedy occurs to one of the team (I won't say who, so that those who read my review, will not have the story spoiled for them).  Havers, Lynley and Nkata solve the case, but at what a cost!  Will there now be more Lynley and Havers mysteries?  After the ending in this book, it's hard to determine how Ms. George will continue.  But continue she must!  I cannot imagine life without a new Lynley-Havers mystery to look forward to.	2005-04-19

In this one Lovejoy is totally in a \\"Women's world\\", and even the bad person in this one is a woman.  The biggest problem that Lovejoy has is that he can't figure out who is the bad and who is the good, and he gets all confused when dealing with women anyway.  I recommend this series highly, but this book is not a good place to begin to read the Lovejoy series.  As usual there are a lot of characters and it's hard to keep them all sraight, even if you're a repeat reader.  I recomend beginning at the beginning of the series, and working your way through.  The books are wonderful, and you'll find you get as addicted to them as me.  In this one we again learn a lot about the world of antiques and the world of faking antiques.  We also get a first-hand look at what a \\"dollop broker\\" does.  Boy these are good stories!	2005-04-11

It is still a light and very enjoyable cozy, but there is a bit of a twist to it.  In this one Inspector Witherspoon solves a case on his own.  Even though the staff at Upper Edmonton Gardens are busy out and about getting information on the murder victim and the possible suspects, Inspector Witherspoon works it out on his own, and the motive turns out to be something that none of the staff had even thought of.  Even though they are a bit disgruntled about that, they realize at the end that the Inspector will be around investigating homicides for awhile, and they'll be able to continue \\"helping\\" him.	2005-04-07

This series is a total delight, and this book is certainly one of my personal favourites.  In the book we actually have two parallel stories running - that of Amelia and Emerson, and their search to solve the mystery of the mysterious mummy that they have found, and the young people - Ramses, David and Nefret doing their own thing to solve that same mystery.  What makes the story so very funny is that Amelia is not at all aware of what \\"the children\\" are doing.  That is one of the funniest things in the book - her insistence on calling the three young people children.  She has no idea what dangerous games they are up to.  Emerson guesses, but he keeps his thoughts to himself.  Ramses is turning into quite a character.  In this book he is sixteen years of age, but his immense intelligence, his skill at disguise and his knowledge of many languages make him a formidable opponent.  I really can't wait to see what this group of five people get up to next!  Ms. Peters tells a wonderful story, but it's her characterizations that are so remarkable.	2005-04-06

Miss Silver gets drawn into it when someone is found dead in a beach house.  In this case, the murdered victim has more enemies than enough, and there are more motives than enough so it makes it difficult to find the killer.

Only Agatha Christie would think to bring an end to her hero in this way.  This is the ultimate crime and the ultimate murderer.  Talk about going out with a bang!  The whole book is one big deceit, and Poirot is the biggest deceiver of all.  It's certainly a shocker. I have read all of the Poirot books, and this book happens to be the last one of these stories that I've read.  I think that's fitting.  I never could bring myself to read it before because I couldn't bear that it was the last of the little Belgian detective.  But one thing about Poirot books, and this one is no exception, it can certatinly be read and enjoyed again.  They are all complex enough that certain things are missed in the first reading.

This book is a thriller that covers a large number of different kinds of love, and each kind is wonderfully described by Ms, Rendall's magic pen.  There is the love between a man and a woman, the love between a man and his daughter, the love between a mother and her son, the love between two men, and last the obsessive love between a man and his ideal of a woman.  Each of these types of love is shown to be almost pathological except the love between a man and his daughter.  That is the love that endures, and the love that we are left with at the end of the novel.  All the other kinds burn very hot and then fizzle out. Again, Ms. Rendall, writing as Ms Barbara Vine effortlessly enters into the criminal and patholobgical mind, and she brings us along for the ride.  This is a very deep book, and on first read, it doesn't appear that way, but as you think about it afterwards you realize that there are many nuances hidden within the story.  Take the time to read the story and you won't be disappointed.	2005-03-31

Even in this day and age, this book pushes the boundaries of what a novel should look like.  Sterne wrote a masterpiece and the surprising thing about this is that the book is as different from a novel as any can be.  He uses more than one language in parts, he uses blank pages, and he skips from one topic to another, as the mood takes him.  The book is a series of of character sketches, but the story about Tristram's Uncle Toby holds it all together.  I think the genius of this book is Sterne's mastery of making one detail relevant to another.  Sterne touches on all the elements of human life - Love, war, business, theology, religion, science, trade and medicine.  Sterne juggles all these as well as his main story almost effortlessly.  And parts of it will make you laugh out loud. The sketch that I found the funniest was Uncle Toby's abortive efforts to  pursue Mrs. Wadman.  It's absolutely hilarious!	2005-03-30

She still shows throughout the book that she deserves the title of \\"Queen of the Straight Crime Novel\\".  In this book more than any of her others, we see her love for her adopted country of New Zealand.  Her descriptions of this wild and beautiful land are wonderful.  We also see her entering bravely into a \\"modern\\" setting.  She discusses Diva misbehaviour and the curse of the paparazzi like a pro.  In this book we have Alleyn and his wife Troy visiting a very rich man on his private island right smack off a lake in the New Zealand wilderness.  The guests include this man's mistress - a world famous opera soprano, and her entourage.  Of course murder occurs, and Alleyn is left to deal with it entirely on his own, since the mansion has been cut off by  a storm.  I missed B'rer Fox, but still the story didn't suffer.  I am very sad that I have completed reading all of Miss Marsh's wonderful books.  I do recommend them to anyone who loves detective stories.

In this book we have a published writer who wants to hold a writing class in Lochdubh.  Much to Macbeth's surprise a lot of villagers want to take this course.  Macbeth goes to the first meeting to see what all the fuss is about, and finds out that the writer is an insufferable bore.  Not only that, he gives Macbeth a bad feeling.  Sure enough Macbeth's intuition is right, and the boring author is found murdered in his cottage.  Macbeth has to wonder if any of his village friends was responisble for it.  But he uses his not insubstanial brain cells, and manages to solve the crime.  What a wonderful treat these books are!  Ms. Beaton is truly the queen of the \\"Black Comedic murder\\".

The things that I didn't figure out came out as the plot developed, and they were interesting and varied enough to keep my interest.

Gash's imagination enables him to come up with some really wonderful ones.  The best two in this book are Magda and her great fiddles in the US of A.  There are a lot of characters in this book, but there aren't any of the older ones that we know and love from East Anglia.  I felt the book lacked somethingson (?) Zole.  Lovejoy always seems to be a \\"Champion of Lost Causes\\" and these two certainly fit that category, but it turns out that they become his greatest allies.  That and a New York Underworld leader called Busman.  We see more wonderful cons played out by Lovejoy and his motley crue of recruits.  And we see and hear more antique information.  This book has a very surprising ending though that is played out in Los Angeles.  I absolutely love this series, and can't wait for the next one.

The only fault that I had with them is that we didn't get to see the wonderful Lugge in any of them.  But we do see Campion and his friend Superintendent Oates of Scotland Yard.  We also get some pretty good glimpses into the enigmatic Campion's life around the books.  We see a lot of robbery and confidence crimes in these little stories, but they are each great in their own right.  Ms. Allingham's skill of great characterization and plotting transfer themselves quite well to the short story venue.  We also get really good glimpses of the social background of England during the time just before the Second World War when most of these stories are set.	2005-03-17

Dominic and his girlfriend Tossa are at a folk music weekend at a well-known English college devoted to music.  They find themselves in the middle of a family drama, and when one of the performers goes missing, Dominic knows that he has to get his father, George Felse to help.  Sure enough the missing person turns into two missing persons, and a body does turn up.  The plot is woven around folk songs and music, and this is a particularly effective way to string a plot together.  Although I figured out the story before I finished the book, it kept my interest.  Ms. Peters' prose is as beautiful as ever.	2005-03-16

In these books he deals with actual historical happenings, and Hugh Corbett, acting as the King's master spy is always sent to deal with hot \\"political potatoes\\".  In this book he is again sent to try to get to the bottom of the murder of his son's former mistress, but when Hugh and Ranulf arrive they find a hotbed of rumour and speculation in a nunnery.  Hugh walks the tightrope between satisfying his king and his eternal quest for the truth.  This is an excellent medieval series based on true historical occurences.	2005-03-14

This book is like that as well.  In this book there are some mysterious shenanigans in an exclusive private school in Crozet.  Why are people affiliated with St. Elizabeth's dying?  Murphy and her pals Tucker and Pewter are bound to find out. And their human, Harry, also gets there in the end, but not before she usually ends up in a one-on-one situation with a murderer.

The theatre-goers thought that Moliere was undermining the very basis of religion, and in France at this time, religion and Catholicism were sacrosanct.  Instead, Moliere was making an attack on false piety and on hypocrites.  The play is a comedy, and a very funny one at that, but the points that Moliere makes in this play are obvious and clear.  He does not suffer fools gladly, and has no use for false religious piety. I think that he leaves a number of questions unaswered in this play.  For example, who was Tartuffe and was he once pious?  Is the play meant only to be a direct hit on religious heretics, or was Moliere pointing fun at all hypocrisy as displayed by politicians and world leaders?  I'll leave you to find that out for yourself.  Read the play and draw your own conclusions.  I must say that I really would like to see this play performed on the stage.	2005-03-08

This is a really good addition to the Amelia Peabody series.  For one thing we have the entire family with Amelia, Emerson, Ramses, Nefret, both cats and Emerson's brother Walter and his wife Evelyn.  In this book we have Emerson on the verge of discovering an almost unheard of unopened tomb.  The word of that gets the vultures circling, and there are two unscrupulous groups of people after the contents of this tomb.  Amelia and her family are caught in the middle, and there is much danger to them all.  The book moves fast and keeps the reader turning pages in order to see what happens next.  This is a wonderfully entertaining series.	2005-03-05

I found that contrary to most of her books, this one is a lot slower paced.  That does detract a bit from the story, but Ms. Vine's (Rendell's) writing is so superior that she still manages to carry this one off.  In a way it was similar to \\"King Solomon's Carpet\\", although that one was about the English underground and this one is about the world of London on the roofs.  They were similar because both showed a certain aspect of London life and both give the reader clear pictures of London's topography and architecture.  There is probably a whole subculture that have explored London by roof climbing.  The book is not really a mystery, but it is a psychological thriller that explores with such realism the minds of young Londoners.  The book is really about child abduction, and the lives that this act touches and changes.  It is like a ripple effect since so many people can be stakeholders in a child's life.  It's complicated and Ms. Vine portrays the recriminations and sad outcome so very well.  She is a consumate storyteller, and this book does not disappoint.	2005-03-03

This is a big, brash Lovejoy caper, and as wonderful as it is, I wouldn't recommend this to be read before any other books in this wonderful series.  This book's plot and the huge caper are very complex, and Lovejoy has really bitten off more than he can chew in this one.  Lovejoy is recruited to act as a consultant for a film about a robbery from the British Museum.  Lovejoy knows all along that he's a pawn in some crook's game, but he can't figure out why they need him.  Lovejoy, you're too modest - not only are you a divy, but your reputation preceeds you!  Anyway, Lovejoy ends up mixing up with some very bad people, and he even finds himself in between two mob bosses that are after each other's blood.  I love all the books in this series, but I would have to say that this particular book is my favourite so far.  It is the \\"very last gambado\\" (the big score), just as the title states.	2005-02-28

Miss Silver finds herself in the midst of quite a vicious little village when she visits an old friend's daughter in Greenings.  There has been murder done, and blackmail, as well as lots of village gossip.  Miss Silver follows her nose and the gossip to uncover a particularly vicious killer.  Ms. Wentworth has done an admirable job here in portraying English Village life.  It's gossip that makes the world go round in this setting, and Miss Silver is not above gathering up the gossip in order to discover who has committed murder most foul.  This is a very good village mystery and it is a little darker than most of Miss Silver's efforts.	2005-02-25

The choice of murder victim in this book is a little different than most Christie victims.  The scene is an English village and the murder occurs at a Hallowe'en party for pre-teens.  The murder victim was a 13 year old girl, who was known for talking too much, and for making up untrue stories.  Aridane Oliver is at the party and when the young girl is found dead, she calls her old friend Poirot to come to solve it.  Poirot discovers a killer who is totally without normal human feelings, and more people die or are found dead before he unmasks the true villain.  This is late-Christie type fair, but the plot line is tight and there are a number of red herrings to keep the reader guessing.  It's interesting to read Christie's take on young people of the late 60's too.	2005-02-23

This series is a wonderful series, and Morse is his usual irascible and brilliant self in this book.  The only reason that I couldn't give it a 5 instead of a 4 is because the book is just not as good as Josephine Tey's \\"Daughter of Time\\".  It's good, and the puzzle is a difficult, but appealing one, but it just doesn't come up to the standard of the earlier work.  In this book Morse is in hospital with some sort of stomach problem, and he comes upon a little book written by a fellow patient about a murder on the Oxford Canal in 1859.  Morse gets Lewis and a helpful librarian to do his legwork for him, and he comes to the conclusion that the two riverboat men charged with the murder of Joanna Donovan were innocent.  Morse delves further into the past, and manages to figure out what happened on that fateful night 100 odd years ago. This is a really wonderful series.  Dexter is an awesome writer!	2005-02-23

No one can do British procedurals like Jill McGown.  Her Lloyd/Hill team just keep getting better.  In this book Lloyd and Hill are married, and they get to work a baffling case together.  A woman is killed just outside her flat in Judy's precinct, and the murder seems just a little bit confusing.  For example, it couldn't have been a mugging since the four hundred pounds that this woman had just won in Bingo were laying fanned out on top of her.  Then things seem to begin happening and it looks like Lloyd and Hill have a serial killer to find.  Why does it seem that the killer is just a few steps in front of them?  This book is quite different from an American crime story.  The main difference being the strangeness of guns to the public at large.  It's refreshing to see a civilization where guns are not so common-place that no one hardly even notices them anymore.  This is a top-notch series that I would recommend heartily.	2005-02-21

I love the Dame Frevisse series, and this new book in this long-running series is just as meticulously written as any of the others.  The story is a little different because Dame Frevisse is not sought out to solve a murder, even though a murder has been done.  She and her fellow nun from St. Frideswide's (Dame Johane) are visiting at a manor house and are serving as comfort and moral support to the lady of the keep.  But even though this lady has lost her husband, and she and her sons and daughters are trying to put their life back together, there is no mourning here.  Dame Frevisse though can't let it lie.  Murder has been done, and she must find out what happened.  On her quest for the truth she finds a family with many, many secrets and deceptions.  Something is terribly wrong here, and she doesn't know at first how to handle it.  She does manage to figure out the secrets and deceptions, and she solves the case, but it's not a solution that can be shared with the officials.  Margaret Frazer has done her usual exhaustive research, and that is what makes this series so wonderful!  I recommend it hightly.	2005-02-19

This latest book in this long-running and popular series is similar to the last two or three written before this.  I find the writing done in the third-person very off-putting, and it certainly removes a lot of tension from the plot.  This book's pace is even slower than the others. The whole thing is really unbelievable, and there are a lot of plot strands that are just dropped.  For example, the insight that we gain into the psyche of Kay's replacement as the Chief Examiner in Richmond is explained for a whole chapter early in the book, and then we never hear about it or from the character again.  That is the main thing that troubles me about this book.  It's not like Cornwell to be sloppy like this, but her plots have been going steadily downhill.  I love the first books in this series, and I'm disappointed to where we've gotten to.  I think it's time for Ms. Cornwell to retire these characters and get on with something else.  She certainly has the skills to do so.  Just like Kay can't go back to Richmond five years after she was fired, we can't seem to find the Kay that we used to know and love.	2005-02-17

This play is a wonderful little comedic satire that is as funny now as when it was written in 1773.  Mr. Goldsmith's characters are wonderful, and the storyline is funny without being \\"sappy\\".  His characters are so very human!  He does not shy away from exposing human frailities, and he does it in such a way that no one would take offence to it.  His characters make common human mistakes based on misunderstandings and practical jokes, but his characters are not tragically changed from these occurences.  They, as well as the audience, understand human frailties, and look upon these as things that help us grow.  This is a jovial, friendly play that is well worth the time it takes to read it.  I find that reading plays is a nice alternate to reading long novels.  A little different from short stories.  I like the economies of a play.  So much is written and so much is implied all in five scenes.	2005-02-15

In this book we see him in Hong Kong as he's trying to escape some nasty characters back in East Anglia.  He starts out OK with a plane ride, passport and money in his pocket, but he's not in Hong Kong for five minutes before everything he has is stolen.  As he wanders around hungry for two days, we see Hong Kong through his eyes, and he, even with all his troubles, is fascinated by it.  It's easy to see the author's experiences of Hong Kong in the wonderful descriptions that he paints in this book.  Anyway, poor old Lovejoy finally finds himself a way to make a living (and what a way that is!), but he gets mixed up with a nasty lot too.  His experiences with the Hong Kong triads is unforgettable (and actually quite funny too).  We of course see another master fiddle done by the old faker (Lovejoy himself), and we also get more interesting info on some pretty nice antiques (Asian style).  This book is captivating, as are all the others in this wonderful series.	2005-02-15

She's also crafted a quite clever mystery centred around a renowned mountain-climber who falls to his death on some rather small hills. This fact is enough for his stepdaughter to question what happened to cause his death, and for her to set out with three friends to find out more about it. The book centres around Sir George Felse's son Dominic, and Ms. Peters has written a wonderful character in this young man. This is a very captivating book!	2005-02-15

This book covers the time just before the bombing of Pearl Harbour in December of 1941.  The book ends with our two heroes - Pick and Killer McCoy waiting to see where they're going to serve in this war.  The book has Griffin's usual first-hand knowledge of Marine Corps life.  That's one thing about this series, the reader learns a lot about the U.S. Marines, and in a very entertaining manner.  This is a magnificent series, and it was great to read the book that starts it all.  Griffin's characters are wonderfully well-drawn, and his plot is intricate and exciting.

This wonderful book by Steinbeck gives a panoramic history of the Salinas Valley which the author uses as a microcosm of America as a whole.  The story outlines the lives of two families in the valley.  They are The Trask and Hamilton families.  This book would probably fit in the genre of historical romance, but it's much more than that.  Steinbeck delves into the differences between good and evil.  The plot and storyline are much more sweeping than some of Steinbeck's other books.  The timeline of the book is from the American Civil War to World War I, and it covers the entire United States.  Steinbeck does a pretty good job with his characterizations.  His best character in the book is Cathy Ames (Adam Trask's wife).  She appears so innocent to people that she encounters, but this façade hides true evil.  The book is fairly long, but quite readable.	2005-02-07

It deals with the tension between the British and the native Indians of India, as well as with the tension between the Hindus and the Muslims.  It also deals with the mystical in its portrayal of characters in search of the infinite and eternal.  The book is divided into three sections which correspond with the seasons of the Indian year - the Cold Weather, the Hot Weather and the Rains.  Each section of the book is dominated by each of the seasons.  Each section also focuses on one of the three ethnic groups found in India during this time (1920's).  They are Muslim, Anglo-Indian and Hindu.  This is a very deep book, that has to be read at least a couple of times in order for the reader to pick up all the nuances.	2005-02-06

This book is probably one of the most tragic that I've ever read.  I realize that Thomas Hardy is known for his portrayals of human tragedy, and I knew that as I was reading I could not help but be forever touched by the beautiful Tess.  It is another treatise against the smug Victorian attitude to sexual purity, and the heartache that that caused for people who succumbed to ordinary human frailties.  His books were not well-received during his time because the people of the age were not ready to accept the errors of their morals and social conscience.  His books, and especially this one suggest that no matter the successes of politics in removing social abuses, there is an element in man that cannot be legislated by government or by the Church.  We sometimes still need to learn from our own mistakes, and nothing that anyone or anybody says will change that.  Tess learns all these hard lessons the really hard way, and it inevitably leads to her death.  This is a very tragic story, and it brought me to tears more than once.  Hardy's characters are very strong, and the plot and storyline are tight.  This is a truly wonderful book!	2005-02-06

No other book out there fleshes out the pre-World-War-1 era like this one.  Everyone knows the story is about a man who amasses a lot of wealth by various dubious means, solely to please Daisy, a socialite that he has his heart set on.  Daisy had rejected him once before in favour of a social equal, Tom Buchanan.  But poor Gatsby.  No matter how high he rises, he is doomed.  When he takes the blame for a hit-and-run murder committed by Daisy, he is murdered by the victim's husband.  Gatsby is an anti-hero.  His main fault is that he has fallen in love with the wrong girl.  Fitzgerald was very brave to write this book since it took such a blatant shot at the \\"American Dream\\" and the shallowness of the idle rich.  This book is classic that will endure for a long time.	2005-02-06

This is the fourth in the Hugh Corbett series set in England during the year 1299. The book is totally based on true fact - the massacre that Edward I and his army did in Berwick in Scotland, and the poisoning of a Church official right during a mass.  Edward I isn't sure whether the poison was meant for him or not, so he asks his Master Clerk, Hugh Corbett to investigate.  As usual Hugh jumps to help his King, but he places himself in danger investigating this crime.  More than the previous books in the series, this book is more a pure mystery.  It's a tough one to figure out too.  This is a very enjoyable series.  I like the fact that each book is based on a true historical happening.	2005-02-05

This book is very high on my list of favourite books of all time, and it is thought to be George Eliots' masterpiece.  It is wonderfully grand novel that covers a lot of territory in a lot of pages.  There are four main plotlines in the book, and Ms. Eliot develops each of them to the fullest without letting any of them get lost in the shuffle.  There is the story of Dorothea Brooke, the story of Lydgate's marriage, the history of Mary Garth and the fall of the banker, Bulstrode.  The book is a masterpiece because of the storyline and the characters which she does so very well, but it's also a masterpiece because it is a very substantial work of great psychological and moral penetration.  I can't say anymore about the book, since my words cannot hope to convey the grandeur of it, but it is a \\"Must Read\\" for anyone who loves great literature and purity of the English language.  Definitely another \\"desert island\\" book for me.	2005-02-05

Adam Bede is my second favourite book by George Elliot.  This is a wonderful story about a young dairymaid who is seduced by a country squire - an old story it's true, but George Eliot handles this in her own unique way.  No one can create a sense of scene and paint imagery with words like she can.  The story is sad in its honesty, but it does not leave one with the feeling of partaking of a tragedy.  Perhaps it is the sense of hopefulness that brims through the pages.  This novel is one of George Eliot's earlier works, and her character development and writing skills do get better with later works, but her wonderful skill is still very apparent in this book.  The women characters in this book seem to be the stronger, but Adam Bede himself is a wonder. Ms. Eliot was a wonderful writer.	2005-02-05

This actually happens to be my very favourite Dickens, and that's saying a lot since I love all his work so much.  The book is a series of sketches that were published in serial form like so much of Dickens work when he first started publishing.  These sketches were written by Dickens as an accompaniment to various caricatures done by a popular artist.  The main character in the book is Mr. Pickwick and he is a naïve, generous, lovable old gentleman who is the self-appointed head of the Pickwick Club.  Dickens characters are truly wonderful in this book and that is why I love it so much.  The book is funny and charming.  These sketches cover the whole gamut of human emotions, and we see the inevitable Dickens' theories behind them, but that doesn't take away from their charm.  I can say with no hesitation that this was the book that I read that really turned me onto Dickens, and after reading this, I had to read the rest of his work.  Definitely a \\"desert island\\" book for me.	2005-02-05

This book is one of Dickens' longest, and it's certainly one of the most complex.  \\"Bleak House\\" is a very wonderful book.  In it we have Dickens' great characterizations and sense of atmosphere as well as a social commentary on the English legal system as it was in Dickens' day.  It's a combination horror, mystery and social diatribe, but there is humour in it as well.  This is not an easy book to read because it is long and complex, but it's certainly worth the effort.  I read it quite a few years ago, and realize that I probably have to read it again soon.  Actually it's one of those books that you can't get all the stuff out of the first time round.  More and more will come out the more times you read it.  I liked the book, but it wasn't my favourite Dickens. I'm afraid that I have to give that honour to another book of his.	2005-02-04

I loved this book for its characters, especially Little Nell.  In  fact, when I think of Dickens and his work, Little Nell is the character that comes to mind.  She so embodies everything that he wrote about in all his wonderful books.  The plot in this book is a little simpler than some of his plots.  It centres around Little Nell and her grandfather's search throughout the roads and fields of England for a home where they can live happily and comfortably.  The book has been accused of being \\"schmaltzy\\" and perhaps it is, but the ending is actually quite sad.  It's a heartwarming book, and I think a good introductory book to Dickens and his works.  Read this one, and then try tackling some of the other, more complex ones.  That's my advice.	2005-02-04

A lot of people think that \\"Nicholas Nickleby\\" is a bit of disorganized confusion, but I think it's a pretty good effort.  It is one of Dickens' earlier works, and he certainly did get better as time went on, but there is greatness here too.  Dickens is noted for his social commentaries with his books, and with this one he took shots at an actual private school -  Dotheby's Hall and it's master Wackford Squeer - and the book actually did cause reforms to be implemented in the infamous school.  The hero Nicholas is the handsome, warm-hearted son of a widow whose husband's death left her and her two children impoverished.  With the help of a shrewd, miserly uncle, Nicholas obtains a post at Dotheby's Hall.  Nicholas finds conditions at the school impossible to tolerate, so he thrashes his employer and quits in disgust.  The rest of the book outlines Nicholas' life in London.  There are a lot of characters in this book, and it's difficult to keep them all straight, but Dickens' skill for characterization shows itself even in this early work, and the reader gets to know and love each one.  The plot is a bit melodramatic and complicated, but the characters almost carry that failing through.  Certainly worth a read.	2005-02-04

Although the plot is simple and the murder easy to figure out in this book, I still enjoyed it.  I like the characters in this series.  I also enjoyed the look at steeplechase racing that we get with the book.  In the story there is someone going around Croznet killing steeplechase jockeys.  There doesn't seem to be a connection between the killings, unless it was a gambling debt or drugs. Never fear, Mrs. Murphy, Tucker, Pewter and a few other animals are hot on the trail, and they figure out what's going on long before the humans do.  These mysteries are a lot of fun, and especially so for animal lovers.  I enjoy this light series.	2005-02-04

Defoe has written of  a wonderful woman with his \\"Moll Flanders\\", and he has also created a book that is entirely enjoyable while outlining her exploits and her life.  Moll was quite a remarkable woman in her time.  He covers her earlier life of crime and the punishment that ensued from that right up to her later days where she reformed.  She made quite a few marriages, and learned and grew from these.  Although most of her marriages and her intrigues were undertaken in the pursuit of money, she was actually not without passion or generosity.  There is quite a bit of moralizing throughout the book, but it is totally enjoyable nonetheless because Moll was so human and Defoe has created a living, breathing heroine that is as realistic as they come (especially during this era).  Quite an accomplishment, especially for a male author.	2005-02-03

Dickens is one of my favourite authors, and I took up this book simply because I wanted to read all his books.  \\"Barnaby Rudge\\", though  is a little different than some of Dickens' other works.  For one it's about a true historical happening.  The riots of 1780 actually did occur.  It's one of his shorter books, and it was written earlier on in his career.  The book is really not where a reader should start with Dickens' books, but it should be read nonetheless.  It still has the same great characterizations and atmosphere that we expect from Dickens, and it's still a good story.  Barnaby is quite the character.  We have to laugh at his antics, and Slow John at the Maypole Inn is absolutely wonderful.  I read this book quite awhile ago, and while I'm writing this review, I'm thinking I need to reread it again.  Wonderful atmosphere!	2005-02-03

Fanny Burney lived from 1752 - 1840.  Evelina was the first book she wrote when she was twenty-five.  The first publication had to be published under the name of a man before the publishers would look at it, but it didn't take long for Fanny to claim ownership.  The book was wildly successful,  even though it didn't' make much money for Fanny.  She wrote three more books after this one, but none of these really remains readable today.  Evelina stands alone in this regard.  The book is another one that is written as a series of letters.  Evelina is not your usual heroine.  She is bashful and somewhat deficient in charm.  But she is beautiful and young, and because of this there is a lot of optimism in the novel that things will turn out alright for her.  That is why the book is so enjoyable.  The reader sees all the difficulties in her path in her quest for a brilliant marriage, but somehow we know she'll make it and things will be OK.  This is quite a readable book, and I enjoyed it.	2005-02-03

I love Dickens for his characters, and he does a masterful job with Oliver.  He is the always hungry boy whom no adverse circumstances can hold down.  Reading a Dickens novel is like meeting a whole bunch of unique and wonderful people.  Who can forget Fagin and his band of boys or Mr. Bumble with his had and cane?  Dickens' books were all written to make people aware of the inequalities of society during his lifetime.  Some found this uncomfortable, but the general masses loved it.  This book is actually one of my favourite Dickens' books, but I love them all.  He could really tell a story, and so what if there's a little moralizing in each one?	2005-02-02

Collins was a contemporary of Charles Dickens, and its interesting that his stories are still just as exciting as they were when first printed.  This is a great mystery story that is as evocative as its title.  Whoever has read this story never forgets Wilkie's crossroads.  \\"the road to West End, the road to Hampstead, the road to Finchley and the road to London.\\"  This is where we see his solitary woman dressed all in white from head to toe.  The story is masterfully written, and Mr. Collins uses some of his characters to \\"write\\" different parts of the story.  In this unique way the reader really gets to know his characters and how they think.  There is a wealth of detail, and a carefully plotted story.  Still as exciting today as the day it was written.  No higher praise can be given for a mystery story.	2005-02-02

This is a trilogy of plays written by a man who lived around 500 B.C.  Each of these plays is a classical tragedy, and each is wonderful in its own right.  They are about the doomed descendents of the cruel and bloody Atreus.  The atmosphere of each of the plays is doom and revenge.  In the first play - \\"Agamemnon\\" - Agamemnon returns home after ten years of the Trojan war and he no sooner sets foot on his own soil, and his wife kills him in order that she may rule with her lover.  In the second play - \\"The Libation-Bearers\\" - Agamemnon's son Orestes returns home after he was driven away by his mother and her lover.  He returns in order to revenge his father's death.  He kills both his mother and her lover.  In the third play - \\"The Furies\\" - Orestes is facing the Furies who claim that he must be punished for his mother's murder.  Orestes gets the approval of the gods that the matricide was necessary.  These plays are wonderfully written.  They portray divine justice and show the cumulative power of evil.  Aeschylus believed that man must learn from suffering, and his character Orestes is the only character in this trilogy that learns from agony.  These are truly classics.	2005-02-02

It also was a book that clearly stated to the English aristocracy that if England was to be saved from imminent obscurity, the aristocracy had to change their ways.  The book presents a very interesting picture of British politics during the twelve years following the Reform Bill of 1832 told by a crafty and sage politician who could also write a good story.  Certainly one of Disraeli's most entertaining works.	2005-02-02

In this book Qwill and his two cats are involved with the new bookstore opening in Pickaxe, but there's also a lot of other things going on in town.  The town drama society is putting on a play, and they've found an accomplished actor that has just moved in to play a lead role.  Why do Qwill and most especially Koko take a dislike to this man?  This is a little different book than most in this series because we don't have any actual provable murders, but there is still a mystery nonetheless.

Although Goldsmith was brilliant, he was not an easy man to know and to like, and his egoism and unevenness of character does come out in this book.  He was always misunderstood, as geniuses often are.  This book has assured Goldsmith a place high up in the literature food chain.  The theme of the book resembles somewhat the Book of Job from The Bible.  Our hero is a good and innocent man who remains steadfast in faith and unbroken in courage as he faces numerous disasters.  It is a story about the family Primrose and its fall from it's a place of comfort and security.  The family consists of a mother and father and six children.  Mr. Goldsmith's genius is in characterization, as well as his ability to evoke a pure goodness of heart and warmth and generosity of people of simple faith and warm generosity.

This book is actually quite different from most of Ms. Christie's books.  We still get the same great characters and plot, and we see Hercule Poirot at the height of his powers, but it has a totally surprising ending.  It is also a really good snapshot of what the establishment thought of young people during the height of the hippie era.  The book starts with a young woman coming to Poirot's house and interrupting his breakfast.  She tells him that she thinks she may have committed a murder, and then leaves suddenly without saying anymore.  Poirot enlists the help of his friend Ariadne Oliver to try to track down who the girl was, and when they find out, they find a real \\"mare's nest\\" of a family.  Ms. Christie is such a wonderful author, and this book is certainly interesting, if different than most of hers.  She is still tops in this field, and each of her books is entertaining as well as written to get the reader to actually think.	2005-02-01

These little stories are about life and love in the mid-nineteenth century.  This book was first printed as serials as so many books were at that time.  By the time Mrs. Gaskell wrote Cranford, she was extremely popular with the English people.  This book is essentially a comedy of manners.  The people in Cranford live genteelly and they are very proud of that fact even if they don't have much money.  The book is about four old ladies and the life they lead.  Mrs. Gaskell's characterizations are wonderful.  Their lives consist of tea, cards and gossip.  This is a book about ladies.  There are very few men in it, but we certainly get a good description of the male species from the ladies' observations.  It's a wonderful world that Mrs. Gaskell has created for us.  Come and meet the wonderful ladies of Cranford.	2005-02-01

Although this book is a sequel to \\"The Warden\\", it is fully a standalone book.  The reader does not need to read the first book to fully enjoy this one.  The story is about clerical intrigue centering on the power struggle between an obnoxious and imperious bishop's wife and her scheming, sneaking chaplain.  It is a light and entertaining novel, but Trollope's characterizations lift it up to the realm of a great novel.  The book itself consists of a number of subplots which are related to the main ecclesiastical struggle.  It is a funny and warm book that reaches the reader's heart.  Trollope does show himself very clearly throughout this work, and this can cause some difficulty.  Either readers like his work or they hate it - there's really no middle road.  I happen to like it very much.  It's not as good in my mind as Vanity Fair, but still worth a look for sure.	2005-02-01

This particular book though is the one that has stood the longest.  Lytton does a pretty good job with the strange names in this book.  We still learn to know and enjoy all the characters in spite of the unfamiliarity of the names and the places.  He wrote this book and his other historical work \\"Rienzi\\" after he had made a trip to Italy, and when he was experiencing major difficulties with his marriage.  In spite of these personal problems, Lytton wrote on and the people of the time snapped up his work.  His books are certainly worth the effort and the time.  Some may say that he is melodramatic and typecasts his characters.  He does do this, sure, but he still gets his story across.	2005-01-31

Kingsley was extremely popular during his lifetime in the nineteenth century, but his works have somewhat fallen into obscurity now.  He is well worth taking up again.  His books are deeply embedded in the Victorian way of life, so he is very much a writer for his own time.  Kingsley wrote quite a few books, but \\"Westward Ho!\\" has always been his most popular.  It is a story of adventure on the high seas and beyond.  The book starts in England, but his hero, Amyas Leigh is a sailor, and the book covers his trip to the West Indies and South America.  Amyas meets many unique people and experiences many adventures before he finds himself back on \\"Jolly Old's\\" shores.

Smollett provides just the right touch of madness and humour in his hero to make this a very warm, readable story.  The format for this novel is letters which makes for an interesting change, and provides a unique way of developing characters.  So much of a person's individuality can be found in letters and in fact, letters are a major source of historical information.  But in these letters we learn all we need to know about Humphrey Clinker and his England.  An unclean and brutal world it was with death, disease and decay.

The book that I read had only his short stories in it, so that is what I'm reviewing.  Oscar Wilde was born in 1854 in Dublin, Ireland and his name has become synonymous with decadence from that era.  But he wrote great short stories, and it's wonderful to have them all here in one volume.  Wilde's outlook on life comes through loud and clear in his stories.  I enjoyed all the stories, but my particular favourite is \\"The Portrait of Dorian Grey\\".  This story more than any others depicts in stark reality the effects that a life of debauchery, decadence and evil have on any individual.  In it we see Dorian Grey - handsome, charming and fashionable as the world observes him, who apparently remains untouched by the terrible things he does.  Only the reader and Dorian himself know that all his sins are written on a portrait of himself that he keeps hidden away.  He becomes obsessed with the changes in the portrait, and descends into madness as the story goes on.  It's a very powerful story, that I have never forgotten.  There are other stories in this book that are equally as entertaining.  I recommend the book highly.	2005-01-30

This is a wonderfully long  historical book, that keeps your interest right through.  Mr. Reade's descriptions of the English countryside rank right up there with the best, and his characters are great too.  We don't only read about his characters, but we actually become friends with them as we read.  Reade pictures his hero Tito's spiritual decay as one long undulating spiral.  In fact it is that that keeps this long book so wonderfully held together.  We see a wealth of human emotions and duplicity in this book.  Reade combines this with superb historical research to make an awesome novel.  The book is lifelike, interesting and compelling reading.  He's probably one of the best historical writers out there from any time.	2005-01-30

A seven-year span that saw the rise and fall of Anne Boleyn, and the ascendancy of Jane Seymour in King Henry VIII's life.  There are an awful lot of characters in this book, but at this time in England's history large castles like Windsor were home and life to a small community.

In this one we have weddings, writs, murder and of course antiques.  You may think - \\"A typical Lovejoy romp.\\".  Yes, it is that, but this book is such a lot of fun!  It's Lovejoy himself who makes these stories so readable.  He is totally irresistable with his thieve's code of honour and his incessent womanizing.  He's a scalawag, but such an adorable one.  The books are set to a very frenetic pace, and sometimes it's hard to keep up whilst deciphering the English slang \\"doorarling\\", but oh, it's worth it!  In this book we learn about Moonspenders.  These are the people that go out at night with their metal detectors looking for old antiques.  And you can bet they don't tell the antiquities people what they find.  This book is set in Lovejoy's own East Anglia, and it's not very far from his cottage where all the action occurs.

The book tells about the remarkable family of Dashwood whose family home was located in Sussex.  The book is about two sisters who are as diametrically opposite as two can be.  Marianne is the younger sister, and she is eager, imprudent and excitable.  Elinor is much more sensible than her young sister, and her voice is always the voice of reason.  But it's the world that Ms. Austen always brings to her pages that is so captivating.  She more than many others can create a little piece of  the world that the reader has the privilege of discovering and then learns to love, just like Ms. Austen's characters do.  This is what puts Ms Austen's books so much above the norm in this particular genre.	2005-01-29

This book was a one hit wonder for Blackmore, but it's a classic in its own right.  It's a book that concentrates on one little spot in the British Isles, and we get a thorough picture of that spot.  The setting is in Exmoor.  The story is about a maiden who preserves her purity of mind and body in a quite impossible environment.  Lorna had been kidnapped as a child, but in spite of the barbarous surroundings that she grew up in, she manages to preserve her identity and her honour.  Blackmore creates great characters.  His John Ridd is brilliant.  He encompasses all that is right and good deep within the English gentleman's psyche.  Blackmore has a way of writing about animals too, that is quite unique.  His account of Betty Muxworthy feeding the pigs is wonderful.  This book is certainly worth a read at any time.	2005-01-29

Charlotte Bronte wrote four published novels, and this one was her last.  It is very carefully written, and tells the story about a woman who falls too passionately in love to suit Victorian morals and decorum.  Although I enjoyed Jane Eyre more than this book, this one is good in it's own right. For one thing Ms. Bronte really bares her soul in this book.  We get a much clearer insight of her innermost thoughts and desires.  Certainly various scenes in Villette can be traced to what actually happened to Charlotte Bronte in her own lifetime.  The book is told in the first person.  We get a very good picture of Lucy Snowe, Ms. Bronte's heroine while we read.  It's been sometime since I read this book, and I think it's time to reread it again.  Ms. Bronte tells such a fine story in her books	2005-01-28

He took Boldrewood as his pen name.  He was a very prolific writer from the late 1800's and early 1900's and he lived in New South Wales, Australia.  Browne was a squatter, a stock-farmer, a police magistrate, a goldfields commissioner and a writer during his long and colourful life.  This book is a good rousing yarn about life in early Australia, but it's more than that.  The story is about an English aristocrat turned bushranger who partook in cattle-stealing and highway robbery.  His brushes with the law, and the stories of death and murder is a classic of literature.  Boldrewood's character of Captain Starlight was probably based on a real character that lived and committed crimes in Australia.  His name was Captain Moonlight.  Even Captain Starlight's two desperate accomplices were probably based on Moonlight's real accomplices.  The book is a real page-turner and I recommend it highly.  Boldrewood could tell a story!	2005-01-28

This book and it's sequel \\"The Romany Rye\\" are somewhat autobiographical in the way that \\"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\" is autobiographical about James Joyce.  This book is also not a novel in its true form.  It's more a vivid description of the English countryside and what it was like during Borrow's lifetime.  The book and its sequel were not very well received when first published because English people did not want to read about gypsies and the gypsy lifestyle.  Borrow's black psyche comes through in these pages quite clearly as he tries to explain his life and the problems that he encounters.  As I read the book, I felt it was like seeing a real man's life, as it surely was.  There are three main characters in the book - a scholar, a Gypsy and a Priest.  Borrow takes quite a kick at Roman Catholicism and the pomp and circumstance of that religion in his book.  But even with that his Priest is a shown as a very good man trying to bring his message to the masses.  I did not read the next book \\"The Romany Rye\\", but this one was pretty good as a stand-alone.	2005-01-28

Mark Twain is an American icon, and his book \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" is one of my very favourite books of all time.  This book was actually written before \\"Huckleberry Finn\\", and in it we are introduced to Huck and Tom Sawyer. It is an adventure story like \\"Huckleberry Finn\\", but it takes place mostly in the town where Huck and Tom live.  In it we meet Tom who is the mischievous ringleader of this intrepid duo.  He almost drives his long-suffering Aunt Polly to distraction with his antics and crazy schemes.  We meet Huckleberry Finn, Tom's best friend, and a social pariah to the village mothers.  We also meet Becky Thatcher, Tom's sweetheart.  Twain's characterizations are truly wonderful, and this book comes alive.  This book and its' sequel are not just books for boys.  They both display rich native humour and shrewd observations of human character.  This book also is an idyllic one as it displays early American village life when times were much simpler and less frantic.  Young and old alike can enjoy this look at this earlier and much simpler time.	2005-01-27

Each of the books that make up this trilogy is a masterpiece.  This can be lost somewhat in the hype of the movies based on these fantasy tales.  As good as the movies all were, the three books should be read in their entirety as well in order to form an appreciation for the absolutely wonderful world that Tolkien created.  Even if you are not a fan of the fantasy genre, there is something so captivating in each of these books.  This group of books would definitely be included in my list of \\"desert-island\\" books.  It's probably a good idea for people to read the book \\"The Hobbit\\" before beginning this trilogy.  This little book introduces the reader to the wonderful world of Hobbits.  This trilogy has everything - adventure, romance, war, deception, and a whole world of wonderful creatures!  I could go on and on about this, but you need to read this for yourself.	2005-01-27

This year old fawn will not only become his best friend, but it will help him learn to become a man.

It's a classic as well since Miss Silver has to pay a visit to a large country estate to determine who murdered the owner with his own antique ivory dagger.  It seems like a straightforward case.  The man's fiance is found by the body with blood on her hands and dress, but she claims she was sleepwalking, and there is really no motive for her to kill her fiance.  This is a case where no one including the reader likes the murder victim.  He was a rude, grasping man who made lots of enemies.  But the reader doesn't really like the young fiance who is suspected of killing him either.  She is a weak-willed girl that can't stand on her own two feet.  One just wants her to get on with it instead of being a victim.  But the other characters are good.  Young Bill, Lila's previous fiance is a nice clean-cut young man, and Lila's friend Ray is also very likeable.  The mystery of who killed the master though needs to be solved, and Miss Silver does that with her usual aplomb.	2005-01-27

The Anne of Green Gables series is a wonderful series for young and old alike.  It was the series that introduced my own daughter to the wonderful world of reading.  This book is the first in that series, and it is still the best.  In this book our wonderful Anne is 11 years old.  She's got a wild imagination, and she is a brave little girl.  She is an orphan and she's taken in by her two cousins - a brother and sister who up to that time led a pretty staid and uneventful existence.  (Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert)  Ms. Montgomery's talents are many, not the least of which is her characterization skills.  Her characters come to life on the page.  We also are treated to an author's love of her setting.  The books are set in one of Canada's most picturesque provinces - Prince Edward Island.  These books, though set in Canada, have achieved world-wide recognition.  Anne Shirley is probably one of the most loveable children ever created in fiction.  This is a heart-warming and wonderful story that has created a cult following for loveable Anne (with an \\"e\\").	2005-01-26

Although this book was not my favourite of the brilliant Inspector Morse series, it is still worth reading.  Even Colin Dexter's less than best efforts are a cut above many who write in this genre.  This is a puzzle that has Morse and Lewis going off in the wrong direction right up until the end of the book.  They have the gist right, but no way of connecting the facts to make them make sense.  Who was the person dressed as a Rastafarian at the New Year's Eve fancy dress ball?  Who killed who?  Was it the jealous husband or was it the lover?  For a time Morse and Lewis did not know the exact identity of the corpse found on the bed in Annexe 3.  Morse and Lewis are pitted against a very clever killer this time, but they do manage to sort it out.  This is really a wonderful British procedural series.  The character of Morse is developing into something quite special.	2005-01-26

The book is about a failed attempt by the Germans to kidnap the British Prime Minister, Sir Winston Churchill.  The plot was engineered by Hitler and supervised by Heinrich Himmler in 1943.  The code name for the kidnap team was \\"The Eagle\\", and the message sent to Himmler  was \\"The Eagle has landed\\".  It meant that the small force of German paratroopers had landed safely in England.  Churchill was staying at his Norfolk country house at the time, and that is where the kidnapping was to take place.  There is a lot historical fact around this book, and it's up to the reader to determine what is fact and what is fiction?  This is a very exciting World War II spy story.	2005-01-26

Nathaniel Hawthorne is probably much more well-known for his classic book \\"The Scarlet Letter\\".  As good as that book is, this book is as good in it's own right.  It is probably one of the best ghost stories I have ever read!  It is also a story about love and loss, curses that live through the years,  The most profound truth that Hawthorne focuses on in this book is that the sins of the father are felt by children through many generations.  The setting for the book is a brooding, old New England house.  This house used to be the home of a proud family, but it had been haunted for generations by an ancient blood curse.  At the beginning of the book, Judge Pyncheon dies in his family home in his great oak chair.  The strange thing is that though alone, his shirtfront is stained scarlet.  And to make matters worse, his body is not discovered for some time.  This strange death is somehow traced back to the old family curse, and the reader is treated to what the Judge saw in his last hours.  But the story is also a love story.  It is in fact the love of two young people that appears to break the curse of the house.  The book is a gothic romance, but it is much more than that.  I can't really say enough about this book.  I read it sometime ago, and it has stuck with me for a long time.  It's a great one!	2005-01-26

The moors , beaches and woods in this beautiful part of the world are described and portrayed as only by one who has lived and loved in this part of the world can.  The story is about a house as well as people.  The mysterious house of Manderley with all its secrets is the setting of this novel.  Ms. du Maurier actually based her Manderley on an actual house found in Cornwall called Menabilly.  The story is about a well-bred, but penniless young woman who makes a brilliant marriage to Max de Winter.  All seems to be wonderful for her, but then it becomes sad and quite menacing to Rebecca because her Max seems to be ruled by another woman, and that woman is not alive, so it's very difficult for her to compete.  The novel is a haunting and lovely story about the sadness that this young woman encounters during her married life and what she did about it.  A true Gothic treasure.	2005-01-25

This is a fictionalized story, but it still tells a good tale of what might have been when Jesus died.  The story is about a Roman soldier who had been one of the soldiers there when Jesus was crucified.  He knew the man that they killed that day was innocent, and it haunted him for months.  The story is quite historically accurate.  Mr. Douglas had put a lot of research into this manuscript.  Douglas manages to convey his ideas about Christ and the whole crucifixion and resurrection.  It may not be the idea that everyone has, but it is one that he believed in passionately.  He knew that the secret of Jesus was a secret of wonder and surprise and passionate mystery that can never be completely explained.  I enjoyed the book.  It is very well-researched and written, but I did find it hard going at times.  I persevered though, and it was well worth it.	2005-01-25

It begins with our hero, Silas Marner, a lonely, luckless old man, being robbed of his life savings.  But then a mysterious appearance of a homeless, golden-haired little girl opens up an unexpected new chapter in his life.  Silas Marner was a weaver who through loneliness and through life's occurrences becomes bitter and miserly.  The theft of his life savings causes him to rethink everything about his life.  Ms. Eliot also introduces Godfrey Cass to her cast of characters.  Godfrey is a foil to Silas.  He is the real father of Eppie, the young girl that Silas adopts.  We watch as Silas' lot and outlook on life improve, Godfrey's life dissolves into disappointment, fear and guilt.

Ms. Austen wrote very well about headstrong, intelligent young women.  All of her books are wonderfully warm, but they show a tendency to light irony as well.  Ms. Austen describes her world of early nineteenth century England so very well.  In this book her heroine is Emma Woodhouse.  She is the younger daughter of a wealthy landowner.  She has a good heart, but she is spoiled.  She also sticks her nose into other people's love affairs with some disastrous results.  Miss Austen does a wonderful job describing life in a busy English village.  The village in this story is Highbury.  The characters in the book are wonderful, but it is the spiritual development of Emma that carries this book.  Somehow she manages to grow and learn while staying within the strictures placed on her by her father and by English village life.  Your journey reading Jane Austen's work is not complete if you do not read this book.	2005-01-24

Although this is Hemingway's first published novel, it was not the first that I'd read.  I had read some of his later works before I came to this one.  The novel has been misunderstood for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that many people do not get the irony that is behind the story.  When it was published in 1926 it became the rallying cry for what people of that era called \\"the lost generation\\".  The book is about American expatriates living in France and Spain during the late 1920's.  Hemingway and some of his crowd actually did this, but in spite of that, Hemingway has stated that he didn't believe in the \\"lost generation\\" stuff.  He is more a proponent of man being the architect of his own life, but sometimes things get in the way.  I enjoyed the book because of Hemingway's wonderful characters, and because of his descriptions of things that he actually saw and did.  The section that describes the running of the bulls in Pamplona is great.  Although this book is a little lesser known than some of Hemingway's novels, it's worth a read.  Especially if you love Hemingway like I do.	2005-01-24

This book was recommended to me by my mother many years ago.  I wasn't interested at the time because I was quite young then, but I did pick it up a little later.  My mother was right.  This is a truly wonderful book.  The novel is so well written, and Ms. Buck follows the cycles of birth, marriage and death in the family of a Chinese peasant in the early twentieth century China.  As it is in real life, there are good years and bad years.  The family patriarch is Wang Lung, and he is an ambitious farmer who has a great love for the land.  He has two sons that he hopes to pass this passion on to, but neither one is interested.  Both plan to sell his hard-earned property when their father dies.  Wang Lung's struggles and triumphs are portrayed throughout the book in the framework of the natural progression of life.  It is a wonderful and heartwarming story.	2005-01-24

I love all of Hemingway's extensive body of works, but this novel is by far my favourite.  The story is about a young American man who is fighting voluntarily against Franco's Fascist forces in Spain.  This man ends up leading a band of guerillas in what turns out to be a totally useless military foray.  The novel itself only encompasses seventy-two hours, but in that time Robert Jordan, our American hero, loses his comrades in battle, falls in love, and is badly wounded.  Hemingway's writing is masterful in this classic!  This book, even more than \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" outlines Hemingway's thoughts on the futility of war, and the effect that war has on one single man.  Even though the novel encompasses such a short time, Hemingway makes use of flashbacks to bring the reader into the series of events that led to this particular point in Jordan's life.  Again, Hemingway makes use of personal experiences for this novel.  He was actually involved himself in this Spanish civil war.  His writing style is spare, although incredibly vivid.  This is a truly wonderful book, that I feel encompasses all the best of Ernest Hemingway.	2005-01-23

If any other author had tried to handle this story, it would have fallen flat.  Convenient cases of amnesia are so unbelievable.  But Ms. Peters takes this in her stride, and still goes ahead and writes a good adventure story.  It is probably because of the strength of her characters that she can carry this off.  As unbelievable as the whole amnesia thing was, I found that I couldn't put the book down once I began.  I enjoyed it all, and not the least of which were Amelia and Emerson's son Ramses letters from home.  These were hilarious, and I couldn't get enough of them.

I love Ernest Hemingway's writing, and have read a number of his books.  This is probably one of the books that he is most well-known for.  The story is set on the Italian front of World War I, and it tells the story of two star-crossed lovers.  Hemingway's themes for each of his books are so realistic because he experienced a lot of the things he wrote about himself.  That's what makes his books so wonderful.  Hemingway did not have a good opinion of war, and these thoughts come through loud and clear in this book.  The story is about Lieutenant Frederic Henry, an American who has volunteered to serve with an Italian ambulance unit during World War I.  Catherine Barkley is the nurse whom Frederic nicknames \\"Cat\\", and who he falls in love with.  Hemingway's other characters are all equally well-drawn.  His plot and his description of scenes is also wonderful  Hemingway uses his descriptions of place as allegories to human well-being and luck.  Hemingway associates the plains and rains with death, disease and sorrow, and the mountains and the snow with life, health and happiness.  His two lovers experience happiness and safety in the mountains, but they cannot stay there indefinitely, so when they go back to the plains, bad things happen to them.  A Farewell to Arms appears to be a bleak tale, but it delineates probably more than any other of Hemingway's works his fatalistic attitude to life and death.  Hemingway is a wonderful author, and his works are well worth reading.	2005-01-23

This story is an adventure story that happens to end tragically, but it is more than that.  It is also written in a deceivingly simple style, but the novel itself is as near perfection as any.  On a deeper level the book is a fable of the unconquerable spirit of man, and it is also a religious parable that utilizes Christian symbols and metaphors.  The book has only two characters - Santiago, a Cuban fisherman and Manolin, a young Cuban boy devoted to Santiago.  Hemingway's realism is very strong in this book, and his pragmatic view of life comes through loud and clear.  It's not a very long book, but it is a masterpiece.  I also saw Spencer Tracy in the film adaptation of this book, and I thought that movie captured the essence of Hemingway's genius.	2005-01-23

Yes, it is bleak, but there is still hope expressed throughout.  The comic breaks within the play are memorable.  Who can forget the drunken porter?  What about the three witches stirring their cauldron?  Shakespeare's little gems throughout his tragedies are the soliloquies, and Macbeth has a number of memorable ones.  The play explores the nature of ambition and the complexities of moral responsibility.  It is a story of a nobleman driven to murder at the bequest of his power-hungry wife.  Then we follow these two as each of them slips deeper and deeper into madness.  Shakespeare sets the scenes so well in this play - the cold, draughty castle, the lonely moors.  Because this play is so short, the action moves along quite quickly.  And this also has the effect of showing Macbeth's descent into madness very quickly too, which makes it seem so much more horrible.  Wonderful!	2005-01-22

This play is my second favourite, but a lot of critics think its Shakespeare's best.  It owes it greatness to the character of Prince Hamlet.  He is a man of thought, not action.  He is philosophical and introspective and appears to be swept along by events rather than exercising any control over them.  The play consists of some of the most profound and superb poetry ever composed by anyone in the English language.  Shakespeare uses his hero, Hamlet, to mirror the hopes, fears and despair of all mankind.  This is the play where Shakespeare bares his soul.  He has put his whole being into it.  Again we have the comic factor which seems to be even more funny because of the other momentous occurrences within the play.  We also have the supernatural factor with the ghost of Hamlet's father appearing twice during the play.  And who can forget Hamlet's famous soliloquy?  This is truly a memorable work!	2005-01-22

The theme of the play is filial ingratitude, and this is portrayed as two parallel stories.  The play is actually a parable.  It is also a great acting play, and though it's difficult to stage, an actor only in the prime of his career is considered equal to the task of portraying Lear.  Lear is a very complex part.  He is obstinate, arrogant and hot-tempered at first.  When his favourite daughter refuses to treat him in the way he thinks he should be treated he casts her off, and then Lear suffers physical and emotional suffering.  He begins a descent into madness.  Then from this pit he rediscovers love and tenderness when he is finally reunited with his favourite daughter.  So many emotions to portray!  No wonder it takes such skill to play this part!  Truly a masterpiece!	2005-01-22

I appreciated reading all the tragedies together like this.  There were some that I had read many times before, but others that I had barely read.  The Tragedies are what Shakespeare is most noted for, and with good reason.  Each of these plays is a masterpiece in its own right, and each of them provides such a wide variety of quotes that we all have heard over and over.  That is the most enduring thing about Shakespeare - his mastery of the English language was so great that his words are still remembered today (almost four centuries since his death).  Shakespeare has written thirteen tragedies, and I will do individual reviews of three of my particular favourites.  The ones that I will further review are \\"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark\\", \\"The Tragedy of Macbeth\\" and \\"The Tragedy of King Lear\\".  As much as I enjoy each of these the other ten should not be ignored either.  Shakespeare could not keep some comedy out of his famous tragedies, and sometimes it is these comedic scenes that we remember the most.  Who can forget the drunken porter in \\"Macbeth\\"?  It is very difficult for me to pick a favourite out of these thirteen masterpieces, but I think if asked I'd have to admit to Macbeth.  But read them all, they are well worth the time.	2005-01-22

His characters in this one are larger than life, but each has their own limitations and flaws.  The play covers the time of the Battle of Agincourt when the French King Charles was so sure of victory that he sent a messenger to Henry to ask him to give up and to pay a ransom before the battle.  On the eve of the Battle of Agincourt, the English were outnumbered five to one, Henry's troops were on foreign soil and riddled with disease.  The scenes where Henry dons a disguise and goes out amongst his troops to bolster their confidence are great.  The English managed to triumph in this battle where all was stacked against them mostly because of Henry's leadership.  This is such a sweeping story that it is hard to condense in a few words, the plot of the play, but it is a wonderful example of Shakespeare's skills as a writer.	2005-01-21

I am actually reviewing both Parts One and Two with this since they should be read together.The reason why I enjoyed these plays so much is because we see Falstaff in both of them.  He is my favourite Shakespearean character - big, bawdy, rough, a liar and a cheat, but again we know what he is right from the beginning, and Shakespeare keeps him so true to character.  These plays are a bit different from some of the other histories.  There are more comedic parts in them for one thing.  The plays are certainly used as a medium for introducing young Hal (who will become King Henry V).  We see him as a young man, and watch him grow and see the influences that his society and the people in it have on his development.  He doesn't appear to be growing up well according to his father because he is so irresponsible.  King Henry IV was not England's strongest ruler.  He was haunted by his guilt over the death of his predecessor, King Richard II.  In Part Two, comedy still plays a big role, and we still see Falstaff's influence on young Hal until the shocking moment of Falstaff's death.  The best part about Part Two though is the deathbed scene between old King Henry IV and his son Prince Henry.  The play leads us to \\"King Henry V\\".  Prince Hal does finally grow up and he becomes a very strong leader.  Actually King Henry Iv, Parts one and two should be read before King Henry V.  It is the correct sequence and we see Prince Hal grow and mature.	2005-01-21

This genre of Shakespeare's was probably my least well-known until I got this volume with all the histories in it.  I had read a couple of them, but when I got the book, I read the rest.  Shakespeare's history plays are wonderful history lessons, and even when they were written in Elizabethan England, the general public appreciated them for the history lessons that each taught.  Not only that, but each of them told a really good story, so they enjoyed that as well.  Each of these plays have large casts in them, so they must have been something to play in the old theatre.  Shakespeare wrote ten history plays.  Some of them are more well-known than others of course, but each has a wonderful historical story to tell.  I will review three of my favourites separately.  The ones that I will review are \\"The Tragedy of King Richard III\\", \\"The Life of King Henry the Fifth\\" and \\"The First and Second Part of King Henry the Fourth\\".  King Henry IV was written in two parts.  King Henry VI was written in three parts.  Each of these plays is wonderful in their own right, and should be enjoyed by anyone who likes Shakespeare's comedies or tragedies.	2005-01-21

Ms. Rendall is a master of the psychological thriller, and this one is as fine an example as you'll find.  It is a book that is difficult to read because you know as you read that something terrible is going to happen.  Something terrible does happen, but the denouement does not occur until the very last pages.  The book is unputdownable and maddening because I kept waiting for the terrible thing to happen.  What is really so brilliant about Ms. Rendall's books is that nothing that she writes anywhere in her books is superfluous.  Everything means something, and you have to read carefully to get it.  In this book, everything centres around an impossible house that has 106 stairs, and all of life seems to occur in around these stairs.  The book has a dreamlike quality because she weaves the past and the present together, so seamlessly, that you hardly know what kind of game is being played with your head as you read.  Great stuff!	2005-01-21

King Richard III is my favourite historical play, but it ranks up there with my all-time favourites of Shakespeare.  I read this play for the first time quite a while after I had read some of his better-known comedies and tragedies, but I absolutely love it.  I have seen it performed outside under the stars and the theatre was an outdoor park filled with ruins.  The play was held in different places throughout the park.  It was absolutely breathtaking and something that I will never forget.  Richard III is one of the most fascinating villains of history and in literature.  Shakespeare's genius portrays Richard III in a way that shows the playgoers his physical deformity, but we also see that he possesses great charm and wit.  He is the ultimate manipulator and is totally ruthless in the pursuit of his goals.  Shakespeare's has written this play through the mind and actions of his hero, Richard III, so the audience is aware at all times what he is doing and trying to achieve.  We see all his deviousness and manipulation.  A truly wonderful play about a very memorable man.	2005-01-21

It does allow for character development of some of Shakespeare's recurrent characters.  My favourite one of these is Falstaff, and he appears in a number of these comedies.  The book that I read had all fourteen comedies in it.  I have read each one of these at different times, and some more than once, but I sat down and had a Shakespeare comedy fest when I bought this volume. I love all Shakespeare's work, and a collected version of all his works would certainly be on my \\"desert island book list\\", and  the comedies are my second favourite genre of the three that he used for his plays.  I will do individual reviews of three of my favourite comedic plays, but I enjoy them all very much.  My three favourites (and believe me, it's hard to pick three) are \\"The Comedy of Errors\\", \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\" and \\"The Merry Wives of Windsor\\".  Each one of his many plays have numerous wonderful quotes that are still used and recognized today.  I personally feel that a reader can't love great literature if that reader does not love Shakespeare too.	2005-01-20

I love all Shakespeare's works in all his genres, but this play is my favourite one of the Comedies.  I have read it numerous times, but I have also seen it played on the stage, and it was unbelievably funny there.  This play is actually one of Shakespeare's earliest.  The play is a story about doubles, and the confusion that arises from this.  Shakespeare protagaonists are a pair of twins, and to complicate things further each twin has an identical twin for a servant.  Shakespeare's humour is bawdy as it was expected to be during the Elizabethan age.  Some people think this particular play displays farcical humour because the humour is so broad, but I truly enjoyed reading it and seeing it.  I think the genius of this particular play is in the deftness of the plot and the fast-paced perfection and timing of its action.  I laughed out loud many times during this wonderful play.	2005-01-20

To me it is one of Shakespeare's funniest.  I truly enjoyed it.  One of my favourite Shakespearean characters is Falstaff, and he appears in a number of Shakespeare's comedies.  He makes an appearance in this one, and he is wonderful.  The scene of this play is in Windsor, England.  The play follows the merry wives in their interactions with their husbands and with their families and servants.  This play is unique too, because we see Falstaff in love in this one.  This may be one of  Shakespeare's lesser known comedies, but it should be read and enjoyed. Don't let some of these reviews stop you from the sheer enjoyment of this play.	2005-01-20

This is a great play to introduce young people to the wonderful world of Shakespeare.  There are fairies and elves galore in it, as well as some very wonderful characters.  It is also extremely funny, albeit the humour has Shakespeare's characteristic bawdiness.  What makes this play special though is Shakespeare's wonderful poetry where he skillfully mixes characters from Greek mythology with Elizabethan craftsmen.  This play is a comic parody on Shakespeare's famous Romeo and Juliet where he depicts a pair of tragic star-crossed lovers.  In this play there are actually five sets of ill-assorted lovers.  And his characters!  Who has not heard of the wonderful Puck?  And what about Nick Bottom and Hermia?  This is a wonderful, funny and beautifully crafted play.	2005-01-20

Emily Bronte wrote a Gothic novel full of revenge, passion, evil and romance.  In fact, the novel was so controversial for its time, that publishers did not want to take the risk of publishing it at first.  The book is a masterpiece with unforgettable characters and a great and swift-moving plot.  I bet that anyone who has read this book has not forgotten Catherine and Heathcliff.  It is the type of book that stays with you for a very long time.  The book is violent and emotional, but it mercilessly probes the psyches of its two protagonists as it follows their ill-fated lives.	2005-01-19

This book did cause quite a stir when it was published.  Samuel Butler wrote in a \\"no-holds-barred\\" style that attacked the Victorian era at its core.  He shows the family as a tormented assembly bound together by illusion and make-believe, or even by hatred, fear and hypocrisy.  As shocking as this was at the time, Mr. Butler was actually revealing secrets from his own family.  He doesn't stop at the family.  He put holes in the marital institution, the Church and at educational facilities.  I know this sounds like a toxic book, but it is really not.  Only true genius can write a book like this one.  It is a book where the author's temperament comes shining through its pages.  If nothing else, it's an honest a picture that you'll get anywhere of Victorian life.	2005-01-19

This major work by Leo Tolstoy is totally wonderful.  It is a panorama of Russian life during the Napoleonic era.  It tells a very comprehensive story about Napoleon's invasion into Russia, and the disastrous effects of that.  It shows the strength and character of the Russian people during this very terrible part of their history.  This is an extremely long and complex story, but one that should be read nonetheless.  Such a long and detailed story leaves the reader changed after he or she has read it.  It is such a beautiful story, and it left me with a sense of wonder at the changes that humanity has encountered over the centuries and it clearly pointed out the size and the complexity of life itself.  I have read this book only once so far, but I can still clearly remember the beauty and the scope of this great novel.  I would like to read it again once more sometime just to refresh my memory.  It's probably one of the longest books that you'll find, and the Russian names can be a bit confusing to an English-speaking person, but it is so worth the effort!	2005-01-19

Thoreau's mantra of \\"Simplify, Simplify, Simplify\\" has become pertinent again and again over the years since he wrote this little book.  The book is an excellent nature book as well.

It is a novel that exposes social hypocrisy  and sham, and a social satire of Thackery's era.  It was written in the mid-nineteenth century.  This book is often referred to as \\"a novel without a hero\\".  It does not in fact have a male hero, but it does have a wonderful female creation.  Becky Sharp is a brilliant fictional creation.  The novel covers so many different areas of society and Becky's effect on them and their effect on her as she moves through the story.  We see many different ways of life from this time, and they are portrayed so very well.  The elements that we see are army society, city merchants' society, country gentlefolk's society, genteel poverty, fashionable society, life below stairs, and we see them all so clearly.  Most remarkable of all, Thackery's heroine's profound effect on her readers is so different than what we are normally used to.  Becky has no redeeming human qualities at all.  She is a liar, a hypocrite, ungrateful, dishonest, mercenary and mean.  But these qualities make her appear so real because the reader is aware throughout what kind of person that she is.  We are under no illusions.  I could go on and on because I love this book so, but you need to read this wonderful novel for yourself.	2005-01-18

This novel is as good a representation of human life as it actually was in England in the mid eighteenth century.  The story is a long one, but it is a wonderfully crafted novel that reads fairly quickly.  There is a lot of humour and warmth.  It can be justly stated that Fielding seems to live through this novel of his, his greatest achievement!  Fielding's characters are wonderfully written, and through them we see Fielding's own ambivalent feelings about human nature.  He saw two kinds of people - good and bad.  Good people are inherently good, but they can be unwise at times and make bad decisions as his hero Tom Jones does.  Bad people are inherently bad, and he sees no good in them.  That is why he has made his villain Bilfil so evil.  Bilfil has no redeeming characteristics at all.  The book covers Tom's life on a  country estate, his trip to London, his time in London, and then his trip back to Somersetshire, and all the many adventures that he has along the way.  This is a fun novel to read.	2005-01-18

This novel is notorious in American culture because of its reputation as a stereotypical novel.  This novel is much more than that.  Her original character of Uncle Tom is much more complex than what is seen in adaptations and subsequent productions of this book.  Ms. Stowe portrays him as a  young  Southern black involved in non-violent activism, not as the downtrodden frightened black as most people think he was.  The book is extremely well-written.  Ms. Stowe can really tell a story.  Her prose and her characterizations are flawless.  The book was written in 1852, but the message that it gives is just as relevant today as it was then.  This book should be included in a bibliography of important works that outline the ongoing civil rights movement in the United States.  Not only that, it's a really good story.	2005-01-18

Nathanial Hawthorne is a wonderful writer, if gloomy.  I have read quite a few of his books because of how much I enjoyed this one.  This is his masterpiece, although some of his other books are worth a read as well.  This book is chilling because of his mastery of language and characterization.  He explores sin, alienation and spiritual regeneration as he tells the tale of a Puritan woman (Hester Prynne) who has an adulterous affair with a minister.  We see the ripple effect that this illicit affair has on Hester and her lover, as well as Hester's husband, and most disastrously, her daughter Pearl.  We see the effect that being ostracized has on Hester herself.  This is visibly pictured by the scarlet A that she is forced to wear, but the effect that this has on her psyche and the way that she finds to cope with this estrangement show how strong a human being can be if pushed to it.  This is a great book, and I recommend it highly.	2005-01-17

I love Charles Dickens writing, and I think his characterization cannot be beat.  I have read all of his books, but I think this one remains my favourite.  Charles Dickens could tell a marvelous story, and this book tells his most powerful tale of all.  It centres around the French Revolution.  The book is a short one for Dickens, but it has a complicated plot, and it is very fast-moving.  It also opens with one of my favourite quotations ever - \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness...\\"  What a great way to start this book about two men - one a dissolute young Englishmen and the other is lookalike, a nephew of a French nobleman.  They meet because both are in love with  the same girl.  She is the daughter of a man who has been in the Bastille for eighteen years.  The book is a masterpiece, and Dickens employs quite a bit of symbolism in it as well.  The story about the long scarf that Madame Defarge is knitting throughout the book is unique to literature, I think.  And the ending of this novel is very powerful and totally unforgettable.  This book is probably one of my favourite of all time, and with good reason.	2005-01-17

It's a long book, but fast moving, and it keeps the reader's interest.  This is certainly a fine example of Dumas' writing.

The unique thing about this is that it was written by a man who was nothing more than a minor clerk in the government of Florence.  The book's success stems from the fact that he made fun of well-known political personages in Government.  Then as now people love to hear gossip of well-known people.  Because of his rapier wit, Machiavelli's reputation is rather unsavoury, and the term \\"Machiavellian\\" is not a complementary term.  This book is worth a read though.  It's a quick, short book, but Machiavelli covers a lot of territory in it.  Now we know where politicians get their rather ambiguous reputation from, since it's apparent that even today people in positions of political power adhere to a lot of the things that Machiavelli wrote about.	2005-01-16

The book is a prime example of the manners and morals of the gentry in a small English village in the early nineteenth century.  Ms. Austen does such a good job of displaying these strictures and morals in her novels, that to us in the present day it appears to be an entirely repressive era (which it actually was).  The plot and the characterizations in this book are wonderful as in all Ms. Austen's works, and it tells a dazzling story.

Up to that point the religious idea of creation was unquestionably accepted.  Religion held a lot of power over people and their lives.  Then this book came out, and it put into question all that the English world held dear about God and creation.  I don't know if any piece of literature has had such a profound affect on society and its beliefs.

Pilgrim's Progress is an important religious work, and should be read for that reason alone.  It can be heavy going at times because of the moralizing and preaching that goes on throughout, but in spite of that there is a pretty good story here.  Bunyan does preach and moralize, but he tells a darn good story too.  This book is a product of the Protestant Reformation (published in 1684) just after the release of the King James Version of The Bible.  The book is a religious and political allegory that symbolizes particular qualities and actions that should form the cornerstone of a Christian's life.  It is a book about the hero Christian's flight from the City of Destruction to the Celestial City.  He meets all kinds of strange and wonderful sights and people along the way and Bunyan does a masterful job of characterization throughout the book.	2005-01-14

I read an edition that had only two of these plays, so my review is based on two plays only - \\"The Cherry Orchard\\" and \\"The Three Sisters\\".  Chekov's trademark is to write about strong and determined women.  This is quite a stretch since the plays were written in the very early twentieth century.  These plays are superbly crafted, and the drama unfolds like a flower in slow motion photography.  His characters in both are also wonderful.  It would be a real treat to see even one of these masterpieces performed on the stage.  I recommend this author highly to anyone interested in adding plays to their reading repertoire	2005-01-14

I've been reading the Lovejoy series, and so far, this is arguably my favourite of this great series.  Lovejoy is very lovable in this book.  When he sets out to help someone, he does it in a big way.  While on the trail of killers again, he finds himself in northern Scotland at a manor house called Tachnadray.  It's a mouldering mansion with not an antique in sight, but that doesn't stop the irrepressible Lovejoy from arranging a big auction sale.  What he does is called \\"papering\\" in the antiques trade.  It means you have an auction where you let it be known that you're auctioning off a family's antiques, and then you bring antiques in from everywhere and pretend they're from this family's store.  That's what I mean about a Lovejoy book - you find out so much about the antiques trade (both legal and illegal).  Lovejoy is at his best in this one.  It's quite hilarious how hard he has to work to achieve his objectives.  The part of the book where he earns his keep by being a carney is quite hilarious.  This is a great addition to the Lovejoy series, and I can't wait for more.	2005-01-14

Robert Louis Stevenson is a good storyteller, and this book is probably one of his most well-known.  It has been adapted into many different forms including the big screen and television.  It has mostly been adapted into movies in the horror genre, and the book is certainly leaning towards this, but it also a wonderful story of the supernatural that still manages to terrify us.  It is also a great story because of  Stevenson's psychological perceptions, and his strong concern for ethical problems that keeps cropping up throughout the book.  The book is still a valuable piece that should be read by anyone interested in great literature.	2005-01-13

This one outlines Odysseus' troubles getting back to Greece after fighting in the Trojan War.  This is a purely exciting adventure story that has captivated generations.  Odysseus has become a folk hero in modern literature.  It is also a love story that is extremely touching in it's scope.  We meet some truly wonderful and horrific characters in this story.  Who can forget the one-eyed Cyclops race?  The most chilling section for me was when Ulysses descends into hell when he reaches the land of the Cimmerians.  This is a grand adventure tale that is truly unforgettable.	2005-01-13

This entry in the George Felse series is well-worth a read.  In it we see the Felse family on vacation at the seaside.  The action of the book takes place over a six day period, but in that time they find evidence of smuggling, a missing body in a family crypt and two murders.  (one from about 3 years ago and one most recent).  The weird thing about these two murder victims is that their bodies are found in an old family crypt in a stone coffin that is actually minus the original body that was supposed to be there.  It's a nice little puzzler that has two or three plot strands running through it.  These separate strands do meet up together in the end though, and the mysteries are solved.  Great story.	2005-01-12

George Eliot's works are varied and wonderful, and although this is not the book that she's most noted for, it is one that she held most dear.  It is a \\"no-holds barred\\"  autobiographical account of her own life.  George Eliot's real name was Mary Anne Evans, but she used the pen name of George Eliot because society at that time thought it was not correct for women to be authors, and she wanted her books read on their own merits.  In this book we read of Maggie Tulliver who was intelligent, imaginative, idealistic and ambitious like George (Mary Anne) herself.  The book goes into the continuous conflict between Maggie and her environment, and the frustrations that she encounters in her search for fulfillment and love.  George Eliot bared her soul in this novel, but it also contains her trademark wonderful dialogue and characterizations.  I have read all George Eliot's works, and found them all richly and disturbingly illuminating.  They certainly do make you think about her and the struggles that she encountered within the moral and religious strictures of her society.	2005-01-12

The story of Moby Dick, the elusive whale, and Captain Ahab's constant quest for him is one that has been around for a long time, and it has been assimilated into our culture.  The book is more than just a quest after a big whale.  It is a complex tale that Melville brings a number  of disparate elements to.  It is an adventure romance, an epic quest. A Faustian bargain and a psychological tale which delves into the mind of Captain Ahab.  We see how this quest affects his mental stability, and we see to what extent he will go to achieve his goal.  I did find the novel rather long though.  Perhaps there was too much moralizing and philosophizing.  But it is still an important novel, and should be included in the list of classic literature that should be read.	2005-01-12

Although a romantic fantasy, this book is a psychological masterpiece.  This book caused quite a stir in its day (translated to English in 1886).  The way Flaubert portrayed a spoiled adulteress had not been seen in England, and was shocking to many.  The genius of the book is Flaubert's plotting, characterization and its vivid descriptions.  This takes the novel far past a simple romantic fantasy.  The realism that speaks out from these pages, and the unique points of view that Flaubert uses when describing Madame Bovary's scandalous behaviour are what set this novel apart from others.  Make no mistake - this book is a masterpiece, and should not be dismissed as just a good story.	2005-01-12

As much as I enjoyed this book when I was a girl, I still enjoy it now.  It's a wonderfully warm tale of family love.  There is tragedy, but from that tragedy comes hope.  Real family values are taught by this book.  It is a story about four sisters and their mother.  Life deals them a series of blows, and the story is how each of these remarkable women persevered, and how they actually got the better of life.  Miss Alcott has a real knack for characterization, and each of her characters in this story are so very real.  If you've read this book before, but not for awhile, I strongly suggest that you take it up again.  There are unlimited surprises in store, not the least of which is how much you'll enjoy reading this book again.	2005-01-11

I know what I'm in for when I read a Sneaky Pie Brown book, so I shouldn't have been surprised with this one.  It's the usual fare - murders in Crozet and all the citizens getting involved in trying to find the murderer.  Then there's Tucker and Mrs. Murphy (Harry's pets) who always seem to figure things out before the humans do.  These books are definitely of the \\"cozy\\" genre, and the characters themselves are quirky enough to make them interesting, but the stories are a little silly.  I always figure out who the murderer is right at the very beginning of the book, and then there's usually one or two more murders after that, so as I read I wait for them to happen.  In this book we have a dead biker first, and then some shenanigans at the local bank that seem to be connected with the dead biker.  I will continue to read this series for the characters (for a time anyway).	2005-01-11

I have read it quite a few times and I have enjoyed it each time.  Actually Charlotte Bronte was being quite daring in creating this heroine.  Jane was a new development in fiction during the time of the writing of this novel (1847).  Jane was intelligent, passionate and totally unconventional.  The other characters in this novel are just as memorable.  Who can forget Rochester - broody, moody, and somewhat sinister?  The plot of the book is exciting and it carries the reader along with a sense of urgency.  This is an enduring novel that I continue to love and enjoy.	2005-01-11

Cooper's plotting skills which manifest themselves in his stories, is incredible!  This is a rip-roaring read that will keep you turning pages well into the night.  His characters are also unforgettable.  The relationship that develops between Hawkeye and his Indian friend Chingachgook is wonderfully told.  This is an action story that could arguably be the first of the modern-day adventure story genre. It's hard to believe that this one was written in 1826.	2005-01-11

In various translations there are few literate people who have not read this classic at least once.  Homer was a poet who lived in the ninth century B.C. and he is responsible for immortalizing a number of now famous historical characters in his legacy of poetry.  The Iliad is his most famous work.  The poem only covers a three day period in the Trojan war, but we get the full story of Achilles battle with King Agamemnon., but the characters that Homer introduces in conjunction with this fight are unforgettable.  We also get a clear introduction to the Grecian gods that were worshipped in these days.  (ie: Zeus, Athena, etc.)  Truly amazing battle scenes, and a clear picture of the political upheavals that caused this great war where so many died.  A person who loves reading should not miss this epic poem.	2005-01-10

This book is written as a satire, but it is also a well-known children's book.  Both children and adults alike can enjoy this story and the lessons that it teaches.  It is important to read edited and abridged versions to children since these versions take out the wicked satire that runs through this book, and make it more of an adventure story.  In it we see our hero, Gulliver, on four different voyages and his surprise landings in four different places.  But, don't be misled - this book is a savage one, and Swift takes aim at the British people in general and the Whigs in particular.  He pokes fun at various political, academic and social institutions.  In it we meet the Lilliputians, and the giants in Brobdingnag.  We also meet the sorcerers on Glubdubdrib and the immortals on Luggnagg.  The stories are quite violent and Gulliver is exposed to some fairly rough and scary treatment, but it creates a wanderlust in him that he can't assuage.  The wit is scathing, and the satire is pointed, but good reading nonetheless.	2005-01-10

It has been occurring for centuries.  This book outlines the historical treason of a trusted citizen of King Edward I.  The book is based on historical fact.  In it we see Hugh Corbett and his squire Ranulf on the trail of a traitor.  Someone very close to the king has been informing the French King Philip of everything that has been going on in court.  It's a dangerous mission for Hugh, and we see him in France and Wales and back to France again while he chases this elusive prey.  This series by P.C. Doherty is a very interesting one.  Each book is based on well-known historical fact, and Doherty weaves his fictional characters seamlessly into the tale.  I recommend this series highly for those interested in English history, and for those who like a good historical thriller.	2005-01-10

Although one of the first Dickens books that I've read, it is still one of my favourites.  The scenes with Miss Haveisham's ghost wedding banquet are haunting and have stuck with me for years.  We see how Pip saw this abandoned wedding banquet, and then we follow Pip and his subsequent relationship with Miss Havisham as he grows up.  Miss Havisham, for some reason has resolved to take out her considerable vindictiveness on little Pip, and we see how this moulds little Pip's character.  We also see the positive effect that a prisoner (Joe Gargery) has on Pip.  The tone of this novel is quite gloomy throughout, but it does end on a positive note.  Although gloomy, it does have Dickens' usual warmth and humour displayed throughout, and of course his wonderful characters.  This is a book that will stay with you for a long time.	2005-01-09

These papers appeared in New York journal's and were impassioned pleas for other states to join the Union.  I am Canadian, but I read these papers with great interest. The majority of them were written by Alexander Hamilton, and he is an impassioned and charismatic writer.  Good history lesson here.	2005-01-09

The Brothers' Grimm wrote beautiful fairy tales, and they can be enjoyed by all ages.  I think I enjoyed them most when I read them to my own children, but I have read them again since, and enjoyed them again.  I read this collective edition in order to get all of them at one go, so to speak.  The Brothers' Grimm were not writers by profession.  They were scientific philologists, but decided to make up a collection of folktales.  They spent thirteen years gathering the tales from various sources, and then put them down in writing in order to preserve them.  Everyone knows these tales, but to name a few - The Frog Prince, Rumplestiltskin, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty.  These tales have endured and been loved for many years, and Disney has made some very memorable animated movies out of quite a few of them.  Read them for your enjoyment, and to recapture  a little of your lost youth.	2005-01-09

He was well-educated where Shakespeare wasn't.  Whether or not that theory holds true, it is worth while to read these essays written by Sir Francis.  This book holds all of the 58 essays that Sir Francis wrote.  At the time when written, these essays blazed a new trail for literary men.  Bacon had a \\"modern\\" mind and his essays  caused people that read them to rethink their whole reason for being.  Bacon proved that it wasn't only religion that should be written about, but natural experiences that men encountered during the course of living actually had more effect in shaping men's characters than religious dogma and rhetoric.  Read these essays to get a more well-rounded idea of what life in England was like during the reign of Elizabeth 1, and the profound effect that this particular monarch had on her subjects.	2005-01-08

It is similar to Chaucer in some respects because the collection of tales are supposedly told by seven ladies and three gentlemen when they meet in a Florentine church to discuss how to avoid the Black Death.  Each tale is a masterpiece in its own right.  The tales are as lewd as Chaucer's, but the wit is dealt with a very light hand.  But Boccaccio presents a very human world with his tales, and through this we get to know each of his storytellers very well.  I recommend this book highly.

Who hasn't heard of Don Quixote and his \\"tilting at windmills\\"?  The novel was intended to be a satire on chivalry as experienced during Cervantes' time.  The book was written in the late sixteenth century.  But the book is much more than this.  Cervantes leaves nothing sacred as he pokes fun at all the social and literary conventions of his day.  The book also gives a very good picture of Spanish life and times as it was in the sixteenth century.  There are lots of wonderful minor characters that Don Quixote meets along his way.  Don Quixote and his faithful Sancho Panza introduce the reader to all kinds of human triumphs and foibles as they pursue their lofty adventures.  This story is well worth reading if for no other reason than the story of Don Quixote has achieved a legendary spot in our culture.	2005-01-08

This book is a devastating expose of the treatment of children in nineteenth century England.  This book written by Charles Dickens is probably one of his better known works.  It has always been thought that the book is autobiographical, but it tells a really good story too, as all of Dickens' works do.  I love Dickens novels for the characters and this one does not disappoint.  We have David Copperfield himself who is the orphaned hero-narrator, and his mother Clara Copperfield and his cruel step father Edward Mardstone.  We've also got friends of David's - Clara, Daniel, Ham and Little Em'ly Peggotty, plus a whole bunch of other wonderful characters.  It's a coming of age novel for a boy of the nineteenth century, and Dickens covers all the pain and joy that goes along with growing up poor in England at this time.  We see David grow up and get married.  We see his pain as he watches his invalid wife sicken and die and his ultimate success as a writer.  Don't miss Charles Dickens' great works in your reading adventures.  I've read every one.	2005-01-07

For one thing it is written in the first person (as if AC is writing his account for a book or a narrative).  Secondly, it's a mystery more than a thriller.  Most of the books in this series are thrillers, but this one has a genuine mystery to it.  As with other Campion stories, the plot has many twists and turns, but with this one the plot really hurries along.  Campion attends a funeral of an old school chum at the beginning of the book, but then five months later he hears that this same person has just been recently murdered.  He has to go down to East Anglia to investigate this one!  How could old \\"Pig\\" Peters be dead twice?  While he and Lugg are trying to unravel the mystery, they find they are both in grave danger.  Although the book is a short one, it still has Margery Allingham's wonderful style and prose.

It is completely about this wonderful man's own thoughtful analysis of his own emotional experiences.  He reflects on his early life when he was actually a pagan worshipper, and then focuses on his conversion to the Christian faith.  Once he converted Saint Augustine returned to Africa and set up a monastic community.  What makes this book so special is that is told with the utmost candor and he holds nothing back.  It is also a beautiful book in praise of God and how he changed Saint Augustine's life.  Although religious in tenure, this is not a totally religious work.  So many observations and thoughts that this man had in his lifetime (354 AD is when he was born).  It is a book about friendships (both true and false), faith, celibacy and love.	2005-01-07

Dostoevski is a powerful and wonderful author, and I have read most of his books.  His books are long and complex and perhaps this particular book is the most complex of all.  Dostoevsky himself spent time in prison, and his experiences and the soul searching that he did there come out in this book.  The theme that runs through this book is that man inevitably pays for his crimes by suffering, and through that suffering he may in fact receive redemption.  This book is about a paranoid schizophrenic by the name of Raskolnikov.  He causes a lot of harm to people because of his own grandiose idea of his own superiority.  But all the harm that he causes he pays for in his own tortured mind.  A powerful and sometimes hard to read book because Dostoevsky's characters are so real, and we feel their pain and suffering with them as we read.	2005-01-07

We have the remarkable Miss Silver who has been asked by Chief Inspector Lamb to pay a visit to an old inn called the Chatherine-Wheel.  The police have been watching this inn for a long time because of rumours of smuggling, jewel theft and drug trafficking.  It's not long after Miss Silver gets there that a murder occurs, and Miss Silver and Frank Abbott are in a race against time to prevent more killings.  There is nothing that the crooks that use the old inn for their illegal activities will stop at to keep their secrets safe.  The pace in the book is more urgent than usual in a Miss Silver mystery, and the story is exciting.  I enjoyed this book.  And of course, there are Ms. Wentworth's wonderful characterizations to help it along.  She makes her characters so realistic and none more so than in this book.	2005-01-06

Dostoevski is as an important and wonderful a writer as Tolstoy, and I have read each of his books with great delight!  This one is actually my favourite Dostoevski book.  It has absolutely everything - compulsive plot, great characters, moral lessons and as clear a depiction of the differences between good and evil as I've ever read.  The book covers the life of a father and his three sons.  This Karamazov family could stand up against any evil modern day villains any day.  They are greedy and depraved and we the readers get to see into their innermost souls and determine what drives them.  Dostoevski's books are psychological stories as much as anything else though, so we also get to see into the innermost recesses of each of their souls.  And don't look for any nice summing up of the plot in a Dostoevsky book - they always leave the reader with more questions than answers.  Awesome!	2005-01-06

These tales, in any translation, are a great example of 14th century English folktales and stories.  They are actually more enjoyable if read in the old English language, although it is a bit difficult to understand.  These tales were penned as poetry by Geoffrey Chaucer sometime between 1380 and 1390.  Chaucer is extremely funny if crude, and each of these twenty-four tales is a gem in it's own right.  He has based his format on 24 mythical pilgrims that are travelling together to get to a religious shrine.  This type of religious pilgrimage was extremely popular in Chaucer's day.  Anyway, they help to pass the time of their travels by each telling a tale.  These individual tales enable the reader to get a very clear glimpse of the personality of each of the storytellers.  The tales are all different and range from bawdy to religious sermons, but they are highly entertaining.  I have read these tales numerous times and I never grow tired of rereading them.	2005-01-06

This book written by Voltaire in 1759 is as funny to read now as it was when it was written.  It tells the story about an illegitimate son of Dr. Pangloss.  This book is a satire and as good a depiction of the follies and vices of men that you'll find.  We follow Candide through many outrageous adventures which put into question all that mankind holds dear (such as science, philosophy, religion, government and romance).  It attacks the pretentiousness of the upper classes.  It attacks man's culpability, stupidity and crudeness.  It's funny, warm and incredibly poignant.  It is no wonder that the printer that was to publish Voltaire's book had to go underground to do so, and that he lost his business and his personal fortune because of this book.  This is a masterful, if blistering satire on the follies and vices of men.  Voltaire does not save anybody, no matter what walk of life they are in.  In fact, the upper classes are painted in a very unflattering light.  Candide is a young and impressionable if somewhat bumptious hero, who falls into and out of more trouble in his life.  He is a naïve soul who believes all that he is told and thinks that everyone knows more about things than he does himself.  Voltaire spares no punches as he outlines his idea of man.  To him humankind shows grossness, cupidity, and not a little outright stupidity.  But even so the book is not as pessimistic as it could be.  There is a freshness here in the simplemindedness of Candide, and in the occasional goodness that he runs across.  His stay at Eldorado is part of the book that illustrates goodness, and the ending leaves on an optimistic note when Voltaire and his motley band of followers realize that good will come if man will stay at home and look after his acreages.  Wonderful book!	2005-01-06

In it Huxley outlines what he thinks is going to happen to his world long into the future.  It is almost uncanny how some of the things that he prophesies have occurred or are occurring in the present day.  He talks about a world influenced by scientists and sociologists.  He even mentions cloning!  (Remember this book was originally written in 1931).  What most people don't realize though is that Huxley thought his book was a comic book.  Even though he thought it comic, he was still trying to put forth his forebodings for the world's future and for each individual's right to freedom.  A sobering, but highly entertaining read.	2005-01-05

I will review only these two. Aristophanes has a \\"no holds barred\\" type of approach to controversial political decisions and actions.  The Birds is a comedy that ridicules the disastrous Greek expedition to Sicily in 413 B.C. Arisotophanes is a wonderful writer and he uses similes and parables throughout his writing.  Besides being comedic, The Birds pays tribute to man's eternal desire to achieve the freedom and beauty associated with birds.<br /><br />The Frogs is a parody on the stupidy and culpability of persons afflicted with their own preoccupation with themselves.  We see these types of \\"puffed up\\" personalities all around even in this day and age.  So like the frogs we hear in our ponds and marshes chirping the same old songs.  This is acually as timely as it was when it was written sometime around 400 B.C.  Hard to believe.	2005-01-05

This book is not what we usually see when we read a Roderick Alleyn mystery.  For one thing, the basic premise behind the book is actually borrowed from an Agatha Christie story.  Also, the book is not really a mystery as such.  It is more an expose of some criminal activity that occured on the Continent to do with the early drug trade.  In it we meet some truly odious characters and Ms. Marsh does a really good job of depicting these nefarious people.  We also get a pretty good description of the world of Cults and witchcraft as seen through the eyes of Alleyn and his wife Troy.  Ms. Marsh can write a good story, and even if she steps out of her comfort zone, she does a pretty good job with a plot that's quite different from her usual.	2005-01-05

There are so many adaptations of this book and so many varied ways to enjoy it, that there is perhaps a danger that it may be overused.

For those of you who have not read this book, then I implore you to do so as soon as possible.  This is Tolstoy's classical tragedy about a woman and her ill-fated love with a count.  Anna Karenina goes to Moscow in an attempt to patch up a quarrel between her sister and her husband, and there enounters the infamous Count Vronsky.  The two fall in love and are soon seen together at various spots throughout the city.  Of course this is a real problem since Anna is married.  This story is about their love for each other and the way this love leads to an inevitable conclusion.  This is a beautiful book, and Leo Tolstoy is one of the great authors, not only of the nineteenth century, but every century since!  His books are masterworks, and I have read each of them.  Anna Karenina is my favourite though of his wonderful works.	2005-01-04

For those who love mystery stories this combined anthology of all of Sherlock Holmes Adventures and short stories is a desert island book for sure.  Conan Doyle was THE author who developed the mystery genre as we know it today!  His works are pure classics and each one is a masterpiece.  Individual reviews could be done on all of the short stories and each of the novelettes, but it is so much nicer to have the works all in one reference volume.  Conan Doyle has reached that enviable position where most authors want to be - his hero has been immortalized and there is probably no one in any of the literate countries that has not heard of Sherlock Holmes.  Not too bad for an author that started these stories in penny newsprint editions! I could go on and on and write highlights from each of the stories, but that would spoil your fun when you delve in and begin to read or reread them again.	2005-01-04

I read this poem because I love the Iliad so much, and this one does not disappoint.  It is an epic poem that covers the time immmediatlely after the Trojan War.  This poem again reafirms why Virgil was the greatest poet ancient Rome ever produced.  In it we see the ancient gods and are privy to all their inner strife and political aspirations. (It's not that much different from the present day).  We get a description of the Great Trojan War as told by Aeneas.  We also see the love that blossoms between Aeneas and Dido, but even with that Aeneas knows that his destiny will lead him elsewhere.  He must go to the western coast of Italy.  We see as he is inexorably drawn to this part of his life.  It's difficult to do a review of great literature because one knows one can't improve on perfection.  Those interested in the Trojan war and some great literature surrounding it should definitely include this epic on their reading list.	2005-01-03

Aesop's Fables are a good way to introduce children to fine literature.  This is especially easier in lovely illustrated editions.  These fables of ancient Greece have been known to civiliation for centuries, and they are as apt now as when they were penned in the sixth century A.D.  These fables were devised by Aesop to get out of any difficulty that he may have encountered with his master.  He was a slave after all.  The stories were mainly about the birds and beasts of field and forest, but everyone except Aesop's rather stupid master understood the meaning behind them.

I also found the writing simplistic and the suspense was not developed - it never seemed to keep my interest anyway.

Usually the mysteries are fun and easy to figure out, but not this one.  This story is a bit more complex and the book has lots of twists and turns. The murder of a non-descript flower girl on a London street on a foggy November night shouldn't be that complicated (at least not during these times), but it is.  There are lots of rivalries and double-dealings, and it even stumps Mrs. Jeffries until it's almost too late.  This is an entertaining series, and I look forward to the next book.	2004-12-24

This book is more of an adventure story than it is a mystery.  Although it gets a bit slow in the middle, it still is pretty good.  Amelia and Emerson are wonderful as usual in this.  The thing I really like about these stories is the way these two complement each other when they are solving their mysteries or pursuing their adventures together.  In this book, we see Amelia and Emerson as well as their son Ramses on a wild hunt through the desert.  They are going to find out what happened to a friend of Emerson's that disappeared with his wife about 10 years ago.  Everyone thought they had died, but his father is sure that he's alive.  The humour is just as apparent in this book as in others, and the story is fun.  Amelia and her family are placed in danger again, but they manage to overcome as usual.  This was not my favourite Peabody mystery, if only because I had figured out the plot twists and turns before they happened, but it's still fun nevertheless.	2004-12-16

The tension builds throughout the book, until about halfway through, I was waiting for something dreadful to happen.  And indeed it did.  As a word of warning - if this is your first Barbara Vine book, you must read through until the end because stuff keeps happening right until then.

Most of her books take place on the stage with actors and actreses as the protagonists.  This one is on the stage, but it's with a swing band this time, not a play.  Alleyn and Fox are trying to solve what does appear to be a very \\"fancy\\" murder as Fox puts it.  A musician who plays an accordian dies on stage at the end of one of the band's numbers.  When Fox and Alleyn start investgating they find that this Rivera is a very unsavoury character, and there could be lots of suspects.

I expected something quite different from a pure political thriller before I began.  I'm not sure if all Ms. Truman's books are politically motivated, but I won't be reading them to find out.  In this book we have an author who is writing a book about an old mobster hit man, and the shock waves from the information the author has researched will rocket right up to the White House.  The book is about keeping the reader's eye on the tapes that have the old mobster's words on them, rather than on individuals in the story.

What I really like about Mr. Doherty's Hugh Corbett series is that they are based on actual historical occurances, and Mr. Doherty writes a really good story around the actual historical happenings. This book explains the situation in Scotland in the year 1263 (before the war between England and the warlords of Scotland led by Robert Bruce).  The movie Braveheart covers this actual war.

I've often wondered what it would be like if Margery Allingham decided to write an English country manor mystery.  I knew instinctivley that it would be nothing like anything we've seen from Patricia Wentworth or even Agatha Christie.  Well, now I need wonder no longer.  This is an English country manor mystery like none you've ever read before.  For one thing it is much more sinister and much darker than the books from this genre usually are.  Secondly, it's written by the grand mistress of crime Miss Allingham herself.  We are treated to another look entirely at Albert Campion - different than anything before.  The main difference is that he is much more personally involved with this one than he usually is, and he knows that too.  And because he knows that he is not comfortable with it and tries repeatedly to pull himself away, but finds that he can never successfully withdraw from trying to solve these crimes.  The book is also different for Miss Allingham and her hero Campion because it is set within the theatrical set.  And what an excellent job she does of portraying the artistic temperament. It also goes to show that not only Ngaio Marsh can excel in this particular arena.  You must read this book if you are interested to hear more since I will not spoil the fun for anyone.  If you've never read Margery Allingham before this may be a good place to start, but bear in mind that the plot is quite different from most of her books about Campion.	2004-11-28

Anyway, you can bet that murder and mayhem are going to follow her around, but she will persevere as she always does. We get lots of introduction to her two friends Roy and Charles, and they are just as delightful as always. Not a bad book at all!	2004-11-23

Ms. Perry's Christmas novellas are becoming a seasonal tradition for me.  As a follow-up to the one she wrote last year about a young Lady Vespasia Cumming-Gould, there is this one about a favourite character from the William Monk series.  Henry Rathbone (Oliver's brilliant and wonderful father) stars in this little book.  In it Henry goes to pay a visit to a grieving family who have just lost their father, who happened to also be a dear friend of Henry's.  It is Christmas time and the snow is on the ground in the Lake District.  Henry goes to comfort the dead man's wife who happens to be his goddaughter.  It at first appears that it was an accident that took his friend, but as Henry and the rest of the family dig around, they find out that it was indeed murder.  But unmasking this murder could be very costly for this family.  Henry knows this, but also knows that he must pursue the truth at all costs.  As in all Ms. Perry's books, her cast of characters and her storyline are absolutely wonderful.	2004-11-23

This wasn't the best Miss Silver mystery that I've read. First of all we hardly see Miss Silver at all, and she isn't the one who actually solves this case. A lot of the action takes place without her presence. Since I read Miss Silver to see her sharp mind in action, that was a disappointment. Also, the mystery wasn't too hard to figure out, so maybe they didn't need Miss Silver's razor-sharp intelligence for this one. It starts with a village woman seeing a man dragging what was obviously a dead woman's body in the night, but there was no body to find afterwards, so no one really believed her until she turns up dead too. Frank and Miss Silver set out to find the first woman's body. As in all Miss Silver books there is a love interest, but this has a bit of a twist since it involves a separated married couple. A bit disappointing, this one.	2004-11-21

Lovejoy goes to Ireland in order to avenge a friend's death, and to take part in the ultimate \\"sleeper\\" scheme.  As Lovejoy said - \\"Times are hard in the antiques industry and it's not the dealers' fault if antiques have to be salted away and redisovered.  It's also not his fault if such antiques  are not really antiques at all.\\"  Welcome to the sleazy world of Lovejoy and his unique look on crime.  Who'd have thought there could be so many grey areas?  Anyway, this is another good one in the Lovejoy series, and Gash handles his double con job with a deft hand indeed.  Can't wait to read more.	2004-11-19

I have been enjoying the Amelia Peabody series up to now, but my biggest complaint was that at times it appeared a bit fantastical and far-fetched, but Ms. Peters can get away with this in her stories because of the settings - Victorian Egypt with a good dollop of the superstitious Ancient Egypt.  This book is set in England though, and even though there is still an Egyptian cast to the plot, it's more about chasing a gang of criminals in Victorian London.  Amelia and her Emerson are totally charming, and in this book they appear to become even more human.  Ms. Peters has a real knack for characterization.  Even their precosious son Ramses become much more likeable in this outing.  Amelia and Emerson are on the tail of mysterious priest who seems to leave dead bodies behind him.  They get in their usual scrapes, and there's still the usual love interest in the book (although this one takes more of a secondary role in the story).  The book is funny, endearing and utterly delightful.	2004-11-16

It also has a very convoluted plot that is difficult to follow.  In spite of that, I still give it four stars because it is written by Agatha Christie in her usual creative style.  The book will certainly keep the readers guessing as they set out with Poirot to get to the bottom of an old murder case that has already been tried by the courts.  A man has been convicted of killing Mrs. McGinty, but Poirot and Inspector Spence don't think he did it.  When Poirot starts digging he finds ties to other much older murder cases, and it's a case of identifying people, some thirty years later.  Another thing that Ms. Christie does so well is characterization, and this book is certainly no exception.  I absolutely loved the muddle-headed Mrs. Summerhayes.	2004-11-10

Colin Dexter's Inspector Morse series is a must read for mystery fans.  Notice that I say the series, not just a specific book.  They are all equally good and each one is unique in it's mystery and puzzle.  In this book a woman that Morse had met at a banquet is found hanging in her kitchen.  Did she commit suicide or was she helped.  Morse needs to find out because the woman had left an impression on him six months before at the banquet.  By the time the reader gets to the end of the book there is another death that is most certainly a murder in the Jericho section of Oxford (in fact next door to where the woman was found).  Morse knows that the two deaths are connected, but what a convoluted puzzle for him to figure out.  Everyone involved is lying and that doesn't make it any easier for him, but the irascible Morse figures it out in the end.  These books are extremely well-written, and a real joy to read since they are so well-written.  The plots are always extremely clever, and they keep you guessing right until the end.	2004-11-09

Ruth Rendell (Barbara Vine in this case) cannot be beaten when writing in her genre.  As Barbara Vine she writes psychological mysteries that are extraordinary.  I never cease to marvel at her ingenuity and imagination!  In this book she drifts back and forth across time while describing journals written by a young Danish woman in the very early part of the twentieth century.  Anna's descendents are left trying to discover the secrets behind the journals which have been kept hidden for upwards of eighty years.  The way Ms. Vine seamlessly slips back and forth between 1905 and the present day (or at least 1991 close to when this novel was actually written), is truly remarkable while at the same time maintaining an aura of suspense throughout is a feat few authors could successfully accomplish, but she does it flawlessly.  A true master of the psychological thriller genre!	2004-11-08

I don't usually read books from the political thriller category, but I'm glad that I took the time to read this one.  It's a very well-written thriller that happens to have a political agenda.  In it we see corrupt politicians, all the way up the food chain to the top job in the United States.  We have Mark Beamon, a suspended FBI agent, hired by someone (he doesn't know who) to find a suspect.  As soon as he starts looking for Darby Moore (a world-class climber), Mark realizes that it's more than just a missing person job.  People keep dying everywhere, and Mark keeps getting threatened and in some big scrapes.  In his efforts to help Darby Mark unearths a political plot that could rock the country if it is exposed.

This is a very good book, and it's very well-written by an author who is making his first attempt.  In the book we learn of Benjamin Weaver (a Jew who lives in 1719 England).  Weaver was a fighter (or pugilist) before he became a private enquiry agent, and the skills that he learned in the ring, as well as what he picked up during his previous career as a house breaker, help him solve some difficult cases.  In this book Weaver sets out to try to solve the crime of who killed his own father, and while doing so he is thrown into the arena with high financiers, robber barons and various other common thugs and whores.  This book delves into the very early beginnings of stock brokering as well, and it's interesting to see how that whole business started.  While covering all of this very handily, Mr. Liss also crafts an historical mystery that is both intelligent and suspenseful.  There are a number of twists and turns in the plot that keep the reader guessing.  I cannot wait to read more in this series because Weaver is a truly captivating protagonist written by an author with a very skillful hand indeed.	2004-11-02

I found the plot tighter and the mystery was better.  It was still fairly easy to determine who did the murder, but the motive actually surprised.  I read these books though for the characters.  Ms. Brightwell's characters are charming and fun and it's great to see them develop through each successive book.  A nice little cozy to keep you warm at night.	2004-11-02

As I have read each of Deborah Crombie's book in her Kincaid and Gemma James series, I find it difficult to believe that she is not English herself.  She certainly knows how to write a mystery story in the British tradition.  This is an excellent book.  In it Ms. Crombie has at least three different crime threads that she weaves in and out throughout.  Her stories are believably written and very multi-dimensional, and she can seemlessly weave a plot so that the reader is quite taken in by the time they're less than half the way through the book.  In this book Kincaid is brought into an arson case where a body is found.  Ms. Crombie's descriptions of fires and how they start show that she has done her research into the area of fires and arson, and into the minds and hearts of those who fight these fires for us.  This is a complex book, and I can't begin to get into the entire plot and all it's varied textures.  You will have to read it for yourself, and I suggest that you read all the books in this series.  Ms. Crombie should not be missed by those of us who love a well-crafted mystery.	2004-10-30

I found it hard to get personally involved in Lindsey's fight to find terrorists.  Not only that, it was almost unbelievable in parts (and so senselessly graphic).  How can one woman in the Police force almost singlehandedly solve a huge case like this?  I kept wondering where the rest of the police force was.  That's what I mean by stretching it.  It also wasn't easy to know before reading the book that one of the women in the club was going to be killed.  During the first part of the book, I kept wondering who it would be and didn't concentrate on the plot the way I should.  Personally I think reviewers and book jacket writers expose too much of the actual story, and it's almost a good idea not to read these before reading the book (especially with a thriller like this one).  I don't know - after how much I loved the first two in the series, I found this one sadly disappointing.  I doubt whether I'll bother with others in this series.	2004-10-28

In this book we see Lovejoy at his most vulnerable. One of his mentors gets killed and he blames himself for it.  And it all started with an antique firefly box.  Lovejoy gets caught up in an international antiques smuggling ring, and his friend loses his life because of what he happens to see the thieves doing.  Lovejoy and his new trusty friend Germoline (who happens to be a donkey) set out to try to right a wrong. As usual Lovejoy has no faith in the local constabulary, and gets himself in a pack of trouble because \\"He will try to fix things himself\\".  There is a lot of sea stuff in this book, and I must say that it is handled very well.  The sea is a different setting for Lovejoy, but he seems as much at home in that environment as he does on dry land.  This is a reamarkable series.	2004-10-27

We already know that Patricia Wentworth has the \\"murder in the country manor\\" genre down pat, and this book does not disappoint in that fact either.  But I feel that Ms. Wentworth can draw characters very well indeed as well.  Her characters are so real that as I read, they bring to mind actual people that I know that \\"were just like that\\".  Her character of Mrs. Latter in this book is a fine example of this talent.  She is exceptionally well-drawn, and appears so realistic.  This book has a very limited number of suspects when Mrs. Latter dies from morphia poisoning, and it just doesn't seem that any of them could have possibly done it.  Or could they have?  Miss Silver is brought in to get to the truth of the matter, and you can bet she does.	2004-10-25

This is the first in the lengthy Hugh Corbett series and I intend to read all the rest (in order of course as I always do). If you love medieval mysteries, than you can't go wrong with P.C. Doherty. He does a bang-up job of outlining the time and place and the settings that he pens are nothing if not realistic. In this book Hugh is asked by the Chancellor to uncover a treasonous plot against the king, and this he does along with his trusty and unique manservent - Ranulf who Hugh rescues from the gallows. As he and Ranulf set out to solve the mystery of what happened to a goldsmith found hanging in a church, they are drawn swiftly into a huge treasonous plot that involves a dangeours coven, and it's up to Hugh to single-handedly subvert that plot. Like all P.C. Doherty mysteries, the plot moves swiftly, and the descriptions of the cold, dank and dangerous streets of London are very realistic and put the reader right into the mayhem.	2004-10-24

He was hired on as a special consultant to find the person who is going around killing presumed pedophiles.  He does some preliminary background checks, but I found he really didn't follow up on a lot of the information that he supposedly got.  He seemed to be along for the ride when the plot stepped up and got there more or less by accident when things started happening.

In the keeping of a \\"spy story\\", Ms. Marsh's Alleyn does not appear as himself.  He appears in the story in a very clever disguise, and the reader will have the fun of figuring out who he is.  It took me a little while.  What Alleyn has come to the spa to investigate is the death of one of the people who had an interest in the spa.  We meet some very unique characters in this book.

This quotation that Perry quotes in her book really describes what Ms. Perry is trying to accomplish with this novel.  If there is another work out there that better describes the horrors and confusion of war, I haven't seen it.  In this book Ms. Perry continues her saga of the Reavely family, and their ongoing search to uncover a traitor that they call \\"The Peacemaker\\".  All this in the stunning backdrop of the horrible First World War (the War to End All Wars).  Ms. Perry's description of battles and the carnage that ensues from them is in itself enough of a reason to read the book.  But the way she portrays the simple human dignity and the many acts of kindness that occur in the midst of the cacaphony of the battlefield and the way the soldiers deal with these unspeakable horrors is unmatched. This book is a masterpiece and there is no other word for it.  This whole series is shaping up to be something very worthy of note.  It is not an easy book to read because the battle scenes are truly terrible, but it is so well-written that it forces the reader to keep turning pages.  A truly horrific novel with extraordinary people.  Words do fail me.	2004-10-18

He's also an event rider (steeplechaser) who has attained some notoriety in England until he was forced to stop racing with the introduction of a sight-restriction rule.  Since Randall can't see at all without his glasses, the British Racing Society says that he can't race anymore.  Randall is selected though by royalty to pursue an inquiry behind \\"the iron curtain\\".  This secret exposes him to all sorts of danger in communist Russia.  This book handles the Cold War situation quite well.  I have read a number of Dick Francis books, and I think this one was one of the best I've read.

Ellis Peters is a very good author, so I don't understand why she would have used the same trick in each of the first two books in the George Felse series.  Also, I thought that this series was a George Felse series, but both of the first two books have his young son Dominic as the key character and the one who actually solves the case in each instance. This book also exposes poor Dominic to an adolescent crush that seems to take over the plot of the story.  Needless to say, I was very disappointed with this book.  I do hope that subsequent books in the series have different plots and a little less of a certain adolescent boy.  In this book a rich business magnate is found brutally murdered in his brand new ballroom in his brand new hotel.  The police seem to be at sixes and sevens throughout the book, and it appears that this murder is just \\"too complicated\\" for them to solve, but it was easily figured out by Dominic.

Hawke is bigger, braver, more suave, more athletic and lot more of everything else!  We also get to meet some rather interesting characters - Ambrose and Stoke for example.  Alex and his friends and employees are on a mission with the United States to locate and neutralize an awesome submarine that is supposedly being used for criminal purposes.

I enjoyed this second book in the Mrs. Murphy series much more than the first, and the main reason for that is that the author has painted a true-to-life picture of what it's like to live in the country and in a small town.  I certainly could see parallels to my own life in the descriptions of country living and folks helping others.  Also, I didn't find the animals as distracting this time (maybe because I knew what to expect this time round).  Anyway, the mystery in this book is a good one and it will keep you guessing until the end.  In it we get to know Harry a little better, as well as her numerous wonderful friends.  Ms. Brown does a good job of characterization for her somewhat eccentric cast of characters.  The story starts with various human body parts showing up in very strange places.  It certainly puts the citizens of Crozon on the alert and sets the stage for more murder and mayhem.  All in all a pretty good read.	2004-10-11

I listened to the condensed version and because it was condensed it made the story more action-packed than usual.  The tension builds and builds until the final explosive scene.  Patterson has a real knack for crafting really malicious villains, and this book is actually one up on that because there appears to be two such viscious killers out there - one in North Carolina and one in Las Angelas.  Girls have been going missing for 13 years around North Carolina, and Patterson's anti-hero Alex Cross is brought into this because one of the missing girls is his beautiful and successful niece.

He's supposed to go there to perpetrate a \\"one of a kind\\" rip (or steal) of a priceless antique.  Lovejoy, as usual runs into all kinds of local trouble - both male and female.  Even in Rome he can't stay out of trouble for very long.  And as usual, he's broke, and trying to live from hand to mouth (or on the charity of some worthy female).  There's a lot of action and a lot of antiques in this book, and I loved it because it's a great caper book!	2004-10-06

This pilgrim series of P.C. Doherty is truly excellent!  In this story, we have the story provided by the Poor Priest and his brother the Ploughman.  The group of pilgrims have been forced to spend the night in a ruined church, and the Poor Priest tells his story about another derelict church and the strange happenings there.  Through the course of the story we are told about an ancient order of Templar knights, murder, mayhem and evil.  Reparation and cleansing must be done in order to rid the small village of Scawsby of a terrible curse that has lasted for generations.  This is one book that I found it hard to put down.  What a wonderful story!	2004-10-04

I'm beginning to understand why this author's Amelia Peabody series is so popular.  The pace is fast, the quips are faster and Amelia and her Emerson are two of the most likeable sleuths out there.  They are a perfect foil for each other, and each is a strong character.  These books are a nice combination of mystery and romance done with a light hand.  In this book Amelia and Emerson take up where they left off in the previous book.  They are a year later in their chronicle, but they're still trying to capture the Master Criminal.  Who is he and what's his game?  They can't seem to figure it out.  There are a couple more dead bodies that turn up with this particular quest, and still they don't really know who they're looking for.  He is a master of disguise and an elusive phantom that nobody can really describe.  But we have a lot of fun throughout anyway.	2004-10-02

It probably would have been better to have read some of the earlier books in the series in order to understand the history of Clara Rinker and Lucas Davenport, but the author does a pretty good job of bringing the reader up to date with this book.  I found that the book had me cheering for the bad girl, as well as the good guys, and I was absolutely glued to the tape machine to hear what happened next.  The story is about a female hit lady (the best in the business), and her personal vendetta to right wrongs done to her and to the man that she loved.  She has a list of four names that she wants to wreak her vengeance on, and we see how brilliant she is in accomplishing this.  Even more notable when the four names are names very high up in organized crime in St. Louis.  I now need to read more Lucas Davenport books!	2004-09-29

The plot is complex and convoluted, and absolutely brilliantly written.  In this book Morse decides to pursue an unsolved mystery that is really out of his jurisdiction simply because he happened to stumble across it while on holiday.  It fascinates him from the very beginning, and soon there is not just one body that turns up, but a number of bodies, all killed at various times.  Morse knows they're connected, and he has to use his extreme intelligence to connect the crimes and determine who the murderer is.  He does get there in the end, but in true Morse fashion, with quite a few missteps along the way.  Wonderful book!	2004-09-29

Agatha Christie is such a master at her chosen genre, that mystery novels are continually judged against her extensive body of work.  And well they should be.  She keeps her readers guessing right up until the end, over and over again.  She is still truly the Grande Dame of mystey fiction writers, and her work will be around for a long time to come.  In this book we have Hercule Poirot visiting a small village called Warmsley Vale.  He finds himself in a real tangled mess that concerns various members of a certain family that lives in this out-of-the-way spot.  The ending is a real surprise, and we the readers have such fun getting there.  No one can match Ms. Christie's cunning and ingenious plots, and this book does not disappoint.	2004-09-27

They have been left there for quite some time in order to be part of the Coast Watchers that were placed throughout the South Pacific.  Their purpose was to keep an eye on what the Japanese were doing in order to maintain the US position in Guadalcanal.  The thing I really like about these books is the characters that Griffin has portrayed.  I feel like I know each and every one of them.

I am a big Miss Silver fan, and this book, though different than her usual fare, is a treat. The story is more espionage than a mystery, but in true Patricia Wentworth style, she has drawn up some very good characters.  And as always, Miss Silver and her friend DS Frank Abbott are there to help us through the plot.  In this book, the plot is more complex than some of her books.  There is a case of mistaken identity (maybe?), German spies (maybe?)and family skeletons.  The Jocelyn family has a few of those in their closet, and we get to see them shaken out.  I am certainly enjoying going through the long-running Miss Silver series again.  A chance to catch up with some old favourites and to discover some new hidden gems (like this one).	2004-09-22

I am a HUGE fan of Martha Grimes, and I eagerly await each new addition to her long-running Richard Jury series.  I really enjoyed this newest book in the series.  Jury has matured and developed into a wonderful character, and there are still the wonderful eccentric secondary characters in this book (although we don't see too much of the Jack and Hammer crowd this time round).  But we do see Melrose Plant, and he is as usual a wonderful foil for Jury's broodiness and solitariness.  Ms. Grimes also does such a wonderful job with children in her stories, and this book is no exception.  The indomitable Lulu is a treat!  But the story behind the mystery is not so agreeable.  Ms. Grimes has tread where angels fear to go with this book.  She enters the seedy world of the up-scale pedophile.  As usual she handles this odious subject with her usual painter's hand, and it puts us right there with Jury and Macalvie as they try to solve a number of cases that all seem connected - the disappearance of a small girl three years ago, the death of a woman on a country estate in Cornwall and a pedophile ring that has escaped the law for far too long.  Nothing is as it seems (as is usual in a Richard Jury mystery), but boy do we have a lot of fun getting there in the end.  Martha Grimes is a wonderful author.	2004-09-20

I will now make up for lost time and read the first book.  I listened to this book on tape, and I found that it was very exciting and kept my interest throughout.  The readings by Melissa Leo and Jeremy Piven were very well done.  I felt like I was listenting to a play somewhat.  In this book Lindsey and her pals in her unofficial murder club are after a real bad guy.  Two of Lindsey's pals are actually targetted by the guy, and it's a race against time before he actually succeeds in getting one of her friends, or Lindsey herself.  I found it hard to believe, while I was listening to this story, that the book was written by a man.  I think James Patterson does more than a credible job with his Women's Murder Club thrillers about four very strong women.  I can hardly wait to read the first book.	2004-09-17

I found that it was more suspenseful, and there seemed to be really two story threads and two mysteries for Amelia and Emerson to solve.  I also enjoyed their precocious little son (although the speech imdediment did get a bit tiresome).  I am enjoying this series mainly because this man and his wife are both such strong and likeable characters who play against each other so well. There are a lot of laughs in this one as there usually is in an Amelia Peabody mystery.  There's lot of Egyptian lore, and enough tension to keep your interest. Amelia and her Emerson set out to expose an organized group of thieves that are stealing antiquities, and supposedly these thieves are killing people along the way.  Loads of fun.	2004-09-16

This book is probably the darkest book I've read in this series. As usual the book is well-written and engaging. Sister Fidelma is asked to cut short her pilgrimage so that she can return home to Ireland to save her friend Eadulf who has been accused of the rape and murder of a very young novitiate at the abbey in the kingdom of Laigin. Not only that but she finds out that Eadulf has received a sentence of death for his supposed involvement with this crime. It becomes a real race against time and we wait with bated breath to see whethe or not she can make it in time to save him. The question of capital punishment becomes the cornerstone of this book. The plus and minus issues on this all important topis are all issues that we still deal with today. Fidelma hurries there as fast as she can with three warriors that her brother has assigned to help keep her safe. And these warriors are indeed necessary. When Fidelma arrives she finds a sinister and dark abbey where she finds unspeakable crimes have been committed in the name of lust and of greed. The characters in this book from Laigin are wondefrully depicted. They all seem sinister and menacing. Fidelma's search for the truth becomes desperate and a race against time in a land where she can find no allies. An excellent book!	2004-09-13

In it we see Morse in all his glory - brilliant, quirky, and vulnerable!  I clearly remember seeing this one done on film, but even as good as that one was, it cannot match the complexity of this book.  In the story, Morse is afer the killer of an employee of one of Britain's national examination companies.

I enjoyed this book, but maybe that was because I was listening to it on tape.  I thought James Naughton did a very good job of reading this story.  It kept my interest through all the tapes.  The middle of the book was better than the ending though.  I felt that the ending fell off somehow.  In the middle, Clive Cussler does a good job of keeping the suspense going and the tension up.  I particularly liked some of the characters - Austin's Russian friend Petrov was a believable character, and some of Austin's sidekick's were pretty good too.  This book explores what might have happened to the remains of the Romanov family after Russia's revolution.  We learn a little about the Cossack culture, and a little about the Russian czars.  The high tech stuff is pretty good too.  Not a bad story at all.	2004-09-10

What's not OK is Stephanie's foolhardiness (Do I dare call it stupidity?)  Stun gunning one of her bodyguards to again put herself in harm's way!  Come On.  I also found the ending was over the top.  It was way out there, and it didn't make much sense.  I found it hurried and puzzling.

It took a bit of getting used to to have the book read to me, but I rather enjoyed the experience.  It certainly does help pass the time while driving.  I would never choose to listen to audio-books at home because I derive such pleasure from reading, though.  Anyway, to the story.  This book is a quite a bit different from what we expect from Elmore Leonard.  It takes us to Cuba just before the Spanish-American war (1897) and we see the country as it was then through some ex-patriot Americans' eyes.  I'm not sure how true to actual are the historical facts, but the story was pretty good.  There is a pretty good villain in the story, and the cowboy and his girl are kind of fun.  The best thing about Elmore Leonard stories is the dialogue and this one does not disappoint in this area either.  I look forward to more audio-books.	2004-09-08

This Canterbury pilgrim series of P.C. Doherty is a wonderful medieval series.  This is the third book in the pilgrims' tales series, and I think the best so far.  It has everything - intrigue, murder, war, retribution and even a ghost.  The story tells of a young squire that goes back to the place of his birth to try to uncover the mystery surrounding his father's disgrace and ultimate death.  He finds himself and his friends pitted against some very dangerous and unscrupulous men, but he is not deterred.  With the help of his friend Cuthbert, and a few others that he picks up along the way he does determine who the traitor was that framed his father.  There is a battle scene in this book that is probably the best description of a medieval battle of any that I've read.  I certainly wish there were a few more books in this series.

As long as they're read with the correct genre in mind, you will find them that way too.  There is not much Victorian folklore in the books, and not much description of what life was like in England in the 1830's, but the characters are quite wonderful and quite unique.  I found the mystery in this particular book a bit simplistic, so that is why a 3 instead of a 4, but I am really enjoying reading the series.  In this book Mrs. Jeffries and her crew are drawn into the world of mediums and channeling with people from the other side.

It's very difficult to pick the best Benjamin January novel, but I really did enjoy this one.  The suspense kept building and building throughout the book until the final amazing chapter.  In this book we really get to see what being a passenger on a steamboat in the 1830's was like.  And January himself - who appears larger than life - has grown and developed into a really well-rounded and well-developed character, and he truly makes this series.  It is also Ms. Hambly's skill with weaving plots, settings and characters that makes this series so exceptional. In this book January, his wife Rose and their friend Hannibal are passengers on a river boat as they are trying to track down a thief who has threatened one of the New Orleans banks.  It is even more important for Ben because the bank that was robbed happened to be his own bank, and unless he and his wife and friend can find the missing money, Ben and Rose will lose everything they hold dear.  What more can I say?  This book is as close to a masterpiece as any you'll find in the historical thriller genre.	2004-08-31

I am very glad that I did decide to begin this series.  It's been awhile since I actually read a Brother Cadfael, and I had forgotten what a marvellous writer Ms. Peters was.  Her characters in this series are just as well-rounded and realistic as the ones in the Cadfael series.  The time and place are much different, but Ms. Peters' wonderful plotting and story-telling are the same.  I truly believe that Ms. Peters is still in a class of her own when it comes to authorship.  In this book the main sleuth is not George Felse himself, but his protege of a son - Dominic, who is 13 years old.  Ms. Peters has written a coming of age mystery book here with her usual great skill. Dominic and his sidekick Pussy are two youngsters that readers will not soon forget.  Also, George's wife Bunty is another wonderful character that I can't wait to read more about.  They mystery too is ingenious and such a pleasure to uncover.

And at the very least, someone has to avenge poor Henry's death.  One thing about a Lovejoy story - they are never boring.  The reader picks up all kinds of info on antiques, and the weapons that are actually used in the story are always something new and unique.  These books are delicious!

Well, I wasn't disappointed with this book, and intend to read all the others.  Although this book is darker than the Ruth Rendell books, it is possible to tell that they are written by Ms. Rendell.  She is a wonderful author, and her plotting and characterizations are really good.  This book is also a little different because it is a love story when all is said and done, but there is the characteristic Rendell twist at the end of the book.  The book is also different because everything in it is narrated, so we read about everything \\"second-hand\\" so to speak.  But that doesn't kill the tension.  I find it strangely kept the tension going tighter and tighter as we read through Tim's narrative.  We are front and centre for love, death, fear, superstition and hate.

As usual we get to see Miss Silver's keen mind at work as she solves the crime.  No one does English country manor mysteries like Ms. Wentworth did.  She has the genre pretty well sewn up, I think.

Ms. Marsh is definitely one of the top writers of the classic English puzzle mystery, and this book bears that out.  I thought that I had read all Ngaio Marsh books years ago, and I was going to reread some of them, but when I looked I found that there were actually a few that I missed.  This book was one of those.  I couldn't believe how quickly I fell back into Roderick Alleyn and his sidekick Brer Fox.  It was like meeting old friends.  Alleyn is unique in the detective genre.  He's very much a gentleman, but smart as a whip.  Ms. Marsh also does the English village mystery in style.  Her characters are realistic and believable, and it feels like you can picture them as you read.  In this book one of the two main spinsters in the village is murdered, and when Alleyn investigates he finds there are numerous people with motives, but do they have the right victim?  Was the wrong person killed?  You have to read to find out.	2004-08-10

Allingham is without a doubt, the best mystery/suspense writer that ever lived.  I don't say this lightly.  There is absolutely no one that can compare to her and to her hero, Albert Campion!  I had read most of the Allingham stories a very long time ago, but when I checked there were some that I missed, so I decided to make up for that oversight.  The Gyrth Chalice Mystery is one that I somehow missed.  I am very glad that I made up for that oversight now.  If you have not read an Allingham mystery, then you do have a treat in store for you.  I heartily recommend that you begin to read them all as soon as possible.  How else can we have a benchmark to grade the authors that have come afterwards.  As far as I'm concerned, Allingham is in a class of her own.  Her books are thrillers really more than mysteries, but what wonderful stories they are!  In this book Albert connects up with a young kinsman of his to help protect an ancient relic that the young man's family has been responsible for for hundreds of years.  We also are treated to large doses of the wonderful Lugg - Albert's man of many talents.  I'm not going to say any more about this wonderful book. You must read for yourself, and be prepared to be awed!	2004-08-10

This book is quite different than the usual Kinsey Millhone book. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I found that Kinsey almost played a secondary role in this book. Also there really was no mystery as such. It's actually in the thriller genre, I think. One of the main reasons why I read Sue Grafton is to get up close and personal with Kinsey. Her character is so strong, and so well-crafted that it seems like she's a real person. In this book I found Kinsey subdued, remote and really not involved in the story much. The idea behind the book is a good one - a complex money-laundering scheme of a huge magnitude, but as I was reading, I couldn't help thinking - &quot;Who really cares?&quot; And the plot is really pretty predictable as well. I'm sorry, but this is not my favourite Kinsey Millhone, by quite a long shot.	2004-08-02

Don't read P.C Doherty if you want to read romantic medieval chronicles.  That is not what you get with him in his pilgrim series at least.  I'm not sure about his other series because I haven't read them yet.  But I do intend to. Doherty is historically accurate, but he's also realistic.  The Middle Ages are shown for what they were - dirty, superstitious, and a lot of evil under the surface.  I have read a lot of medieval mysteries, but there are none out there quite like this one.  This one is tale of mystery and murder told by another one of Chaucer's pilgrims - the Lawyer.  It's apparent right off the bat that he's talking about his own life and personal experiences, but it doesn't make the tale any less sinister and mysterious.  This book is really about espionage, and the lengths that people will go to to protect themselves and their lifestyles.  We see a story about the perfidy of kings and queens and the abuses that people of power committed in order to protect their own lifestyles as well as their king's.  Yes, this sort of thing happens nowadays too, but we like to think that the common person has some protection from those in power.  Our laws, the press, whatever.  But do we really?  That is a question you will ask as you read this story.  I won't say anything about the plot of the book, since that would give too much away, so you will have to read it for yourself and draw your own conclusions.  Good stuff here for historical buffs and for those who want to read a good mystery alike.	2004-07-30

This is a wonderful series, and I'm only sorry that I haven't sampled these delights earlier.  Jonathan Gash has a unique skill in his characterizations, and his first person singular way of telling a story makes us all so very familiar with Lovejoy and his tumultuous life.  He is such a loveable scoundrel, and even though we know we can't trust this man, we find ourselves cheering for him mightily.  In this book Lovejoy is on the trail of some priceless Roman coins.  His quest takes us to the Isle of Mann, and the descriptions of this place are very well done indeed.  Makes us feel like we're there with him.  Again we get some fine insight into the antiques trade, and a first hand, up close and personal look at the business of antique forgery.  Gash is a marvel, and his series pure delight.	2004-07-28

I know that I had not read it until now, and I thought I had gotten through all of Agatha Christie's Poirot books.  But it is a wonderful mystery story, and written in the true Christie fashion.  There are more twists and turns in a seemingly simple murder case than a small country road.  This book starts with the premise that only one person could possibly have killed the young girl, and Hercule Poirot is brought in to at the very least, not have the murderer's sentence extend to capital punishment.  But in true Hercule Poirot fashion, he finds out that even though it looks like only one person could have done it, there were in fact more options than that.  As I reread some of the Agatha Christie classics, I am overwhelmed by her craftsmanship.  She is the true queen of crime, and no one has taken over that mantel yet.	2004-07-27

This is a very intelligent book, and in it we see a very vulnerable, although still brilliant Morse.  Dexter writes in such a way that we're there every step of the way with Morse as he stumbles his way around trying to solve a very confusing, old disappearance case.  It is done so well, that as we read and see through Morse's eyes, the tension keeps on building and building.  We begin to wonder why we can't figure out what happened to Valerie Taylor either. As well done as the televisin series is, and I have seen this story enacted, it cannot come close to the intricasies of the plot in this particular book.  One of the best examples I've seen of plot and character development done in the mystery genre.	2004-07-25

I found the story a bit tedious in spots, and the mystery was fairly easy to figure out, but there was enough to keep me reading until the end in spite of that.  I stil think the series gives a good look at Egyptology in the Victorian era, and Amelia, although caustic, is still quite funny. I will read more in the series hoping that they will get back to being as good as the first book was.	2004-07-23

This is the second book in the Mrs. Jeffries series, and I found it a much better story than the first one.  I also found that Ms. Brightwell's characters are developing quite nicely.  Luty Belle is actually quite wonderful, and Mrs. Jeffries fellow domestics are perfect gems.  In this book a dead girl is found buried in the basement of an abandoned house, and poor Inspector Witherspoon is again out of his element trying to solve a murder case that is a few months old (determined by the state of the corpse when it was found).  Mrs. Jeffries and her crew are asked by the above-mentioned Luty Belle to find a missing parlour maid that happens to be her friend.  Are these two instances connected?  Mrs. Jeffries certainly thinks so, so she sends her helpers on various errands to try to solve the mysteries.  I am looking forward to reading the other books in this light-hearted series.	2004-07-21

We already know that Agatha Christie is the queen of the Crime story.  Her books are timeless, and are as enjoyable now as when they were written in the 30's and 40's.  Not many authors have her longevity, and very few in the mystery genre.  This stoy at first appears simplistic, because there are only four suspects, and each of them very credibly could have been the murderer.  But the story is much more complex than it first appears.  The four potential murderers have apparently all get some sort of murder in their histories, so each one of them could have killed Shaitana.  Not only that. the murder was committed when none other than Hercule Poirot and Chief Inspector Battle are both on the premises.  This is a very cool killer indeed, and Battle and Poirot set out to unmask the killer.  I don't know why I had not read this Agatha Christie story before, but I certainly missed the boat.  It's as I said deceptively simple, but highly entertaining.	2004-07-20

I have faithfully watched the Inspector Morse series on television and have really enjoyed each episode, and I never felt the urge to read the series that the TV show was based on because the TV series is very well done indeed.  Well, I'm glad that I decided to read the series finally.  Yes, the TV series is quite consistent with the story which in itself is unusual, but the books (this one anyway) are masterpieces!  Dexter knows how to build a plot and how to have the reader chasing countless red herrings.  And Morse is a wonderful character!  John Thaw plays the part very well, but the Morse in the books is even more irascible and testy than Thaw's portrayal.  He is brilliant, but somehow vulnerable.  A true enigma of a man.  I can hardly wait to read the other books in this series now.  I'm sure it will put all the shows that I've seen in a new light as Last Bus to Woodstock did.	2004-07-18

I can't believe that I waited this long to read the Lovejoy series.  It's smart, funny, first rate plotting and characterizations (at least this first book in the series is).  I cannot wait to read the rest of the books in this series.  These books are thrillers actually more than mysteries, but there is a little of both in them as well as very funny dialogue.  Lovejoy is a bounder - not strictly honest, but not an outright crook either.  In this book he's trying to track down a set of duelling pistols that everyone thinks were never made.  He gets into a pack of trouble doing this.  Another fun thing about these books is that as you read them you learn an awful lot about antiques.  Great stuff!	2004-07-16

I read a lot of historical mysteries, and I love Victorian ones, so that is why I've begun the Emily Brightwell series about the clever Mrs. Jeffries.  This book is written with a light hand, but the characters show promise.  The bumbling Inspector Witherspoon, the street smart Smythe, the uppity cook Mrs. Goodge, and Betsey and Wiggins, as well as Mrs. Jeffries.  These characters show a lot of promise, and I will continue to read this series.  But readers don't expect a real Victorian flavour to these books.  I found while reading the book that it was set in the Victorian age, but it very easily could have been any other era or place.  Even the English cozy atmosphere that the writer tries to depict seems a bit contrived. For those who read the historical genre for atmosphere, they will find that as well as a sense of time and place is somewhat lacking in this series.  Still a fun mystery (even though an easy one to figure out).	2004-07-13

This is probably one of the bloodiest medieval tales that I've ever read, but it is extremely well-written.  In it we meet a brave knight and his clerk as they try to rid the town of Oxford of a huge evil.  We also meet dark lords, satanic priests and members of the living dead.  The valour of the knight and the constancy of the clerk are very convincingly portrayed, but so is this rampant evil.  The background behind the tale is also interesting.  We are all aware of Chaucer's pilgrims to Canterbury and the tales that Chaucer had each of them tell. This book is the first in a series of tales told by these same pilgrims, but the difference is that these are tales of mystery, murder and evil.  P.C.

If you are a Miss Silver fan, then you should read this book.  This is an early volume from the series.  It's important to see her development throughout the many years that Ms. Wentworth wrote of her.  This book, like many in the series is a little dated, but it's still a smashing good mystery. Ms. Wentworth is a fine example of golden age detective story writing and quite incomparable when it comes to writing British country-house murder mysteries.  In this book Miss Silver is asked by Rachel Treherne to come to her manor house to determine who among her large extended family is trying to kill her.  Miss Silver investigates in her own unique style, and quickly determines who the culprit is, but then it's a matter of getting the proof.	2004-07-09

We also get to meet the irascible Amelia Peabody.  She is actually very funny, and nothing more so than her frequent diatribes about the strictures placed on women at this time in history.  The book does get a bit melodramatic with star-crossed lovers and threatening mummies, and the mystery is quite easy to figure out.  But in spite of that, it's a pretty good read, and serves as a good introduction to Amelia's world.	2004-07-07

Tempe is in Montreal just before Christmas to testify at a trial, but while there some bones are found in a cellar under what is a pizza parlour.  She sets out to identify these bones which appear to come from three different very young ladies.  Claudel thinks they're historic bones, but Tempe knows that they're not and she moves heaven and earth to determine who the girls were and when their bodies were buried in the cellar.  The suspense in this book is relentless and the forensic detail is, as usual, detailed and accurate.  Ms. Reich knows of what she speaks and her technical knowledge is displayed in such a way that it really enhances the plot and adds to the suspense.  I can't wait for another Temperance Brennan book.	2004-07-05

In this book we see Will and Tuck embroiled in a family squabble that turns out to result in the death of a young journeyman tailor.  As it turns out the young tailor is the son of the head of the Crime Guild, and because of that Tuck and Will are thrown smack in the middle of a vengeance ploy.

There is a lot of repetitiveness for the first third of the book from Circle of Stones, but it was done from a different viewpoint.  Circle of Stones was from Brenda's viewpoint, and this one is from her son Madoc's viewpoint.  This book is wonderfully researched and the little introductory paragraphs at the beginning of each chapter reinforce that research has been done.  Ms. Waldo builds very real fictional characters around legendary ones and actual historical facts so the book is like a very interesting history lesson.  The primitive sea voyage taken by Madoc and his fellow druids is written with such description that it's easy to picture the tiny boats heading out on the vast Atlantic ocean.  What an awesome and couragous feat it was for these Welshmen to undertake.  The book is quite graphic as well, so potential readers should be aware of that.  If you are a fan of sweeping historical fiction, you will love this book.  If you like a good story masterfully told, you also will love this book.  I know I did.	2004-06-30

I found it difficult to read and somewhat disjointed.  Even so, Newman's impeccable research shows itself in the book. Part of the problem may be that we don't see much of Edgar or Soloman either in this book.  The book focuses on Catherine and her sister-in-law Margaret as they try to unravel why someone is trying to frame their particular friend Astrolabe for heresy.  Catherine and Margaret journey to Riems where a big council is taking place and while there they uncover plots and counterplots and another murder or two.  Ms. Newman's writing is usually very good and she brings her people to life , but in this book, I found that that talent was strangely lacking.  Everyone was running around and not accomplishing much.  This series is still very much worth a read, and this book is important to read in order that we follow the storyline that Ms. Newman is laying out.  I certainly look forward to the next one.	2004-06-22

It's just as fresh now as it was then.  For such a little book it has everything - irony, satire, unique plot, and suspense.  The book has a sense of urgency as you read it because each of the chapters is written in the first person, but the chapters are not the first-person of the same character.  A number of different characters are highlighted in this way, and this gives a curious sense of really getting to know the characters quickly.  The book has a journalistic slant, and the main character, George Stroud, is placed in the position of trying to find himself as he is a key player in what turned out to be a murder of the woman that he had just spent the weekend with.  George knows who the killer actually is, and he also knows that if this killer finds out who he George is, he will be silenced as the killer will want to shift blame to him.  George is racing against the clock to keep his own identity secret and to save his life. - A very good noir novel.	2004-06-15

It's been too long since I read a Susanna Gregory Matthew Bartholomew book.  She is my favourite medieval author out there, and as I read this book I remembered why.  Her books are long, and there is a lot of detail, but it doesn't seem that they get too bogged down because everything she writes is in aid of her plots.  This book has the best description of a medieval Christmas celebration, and a medieval winter that I've ever read, and believe me I've read a lot of medievals.  In this book Matthew and Brother Michael are faced with a number of deaths, and only one of the three appears to be an actual murder, but they seem to strangely be connected in some way.  Though how could one of Cambridge's students, and two seemingly unrelated strangers have anything in common is beyond them for some time.  So now they have to try to find the murderer and they are doing it at the worst possible time.  Cambridge is gripped in the coldest winter they've ever experienced and it is Christmas time as well.  They set out to unmask a murderer and as they do that, we the readers meet a wonderful cast of characters.  Come along for the ride and be a part of a Cambridge Christmas in 1354.  Ms. Gregory's books are so real that you WILL feel like you're there.	2004-06-14

Ms. Myers two series are so formula and so predictable, but I had enjoyed the Den of Antiquity series more than the Magadalena Yoder series, but there comes a time when it just gets to be too much.  The humour begins to seem forced, the antics frenetic and disjointed, and the bad guys (or gals) more clownish and unrealistic.  That is the case here.  Abby is on the trail of another killer and it leads her into peril herself, but somehow she manages to get away without suffering many ill effects.  And I haven't even mentioned the editing - that is is so poorly done in each of these books.  This book is no different in any way than any of the others, but the ending seems more forced and rushed than usual, especially for the books in this series.  It made no sense.  That's it.

It's certainly the most believable anyway.  Even the villains in this series seem somehow to be people that you've heard of.  Jack Reacher himself is totally believable.  He is larger than life surely, but he has human failings and faults just like everyone does, and he's not afraid to admit them to himself or to others.  This book is unique because it is a prequel.  We see Jack as an MP before he was mustered out and before he started drifting.  The descriptions of army life and tank battles are so vivid that I felt like I was there.  Lee Child obviously knows what the US Army is like.  In this book Reacher finds himself in the middle of a very far-reaching conspiracy.  The more that he and his lieutenant Summers dig, the more Army dirt they dig up.  It puts them both on the wrong side of the &quot;powers that be&quot; and they both are working outside the law in order to bring down some very high-profile bad guys.  This is one of the best books that I've read with a conspiracy theory as the main plot focus.  If you love Jack Reacher you'll love to read this book and see a younger Reacher and see a bit of where he comes from.	2004-06-06

The author, Lalita Tadema, embarked on a journey to uncover the story about her family history.  While searching she discovered that she was descended from a long line of very remarkable and strong women.  She introduces each of her anscestors with feeling and love and allows the reader to get to know and love them too.  The story tells of five generations of Cane River women.  Elisabeth, Suzette and Philomene all served as slaves in various households around Cane River.  They all had partly white families after each had come to the attention of various landowners in the area.  It is a case of history repeating itself, but the women had no choice in the matter and had to suffer these sometimes unwanted attentions.  Some found true love, some didn't, but all grew stronger through their experiences.  In the book we see the life of the slave and the slave owner, the life the people had to live during the Civil War, the time when the blacks received freedom, and the hatred and mistrust displayed by white people towards these people after they gained their freedom.  We see families growing up (all made up of women, girls and young boys).  Fathers lived with their white wives and children, and only visited their coloured mistresses.  Sometimes they provided for them and their children, but sometimes they didn't.  These women knew to take what life had to give, and try to make the best of things.  They also understood the importance of families to make them grounded and centred.  In the last section we get an intimate look at Emily (Lalita's grandmother).  Almost white enough to &quot;pass&quot;, she didn't feel that she fit in either world.  Her longtime lover provided love and security for her for the first years together, but even he had to bow to pressure to not live with his negro mistress and to find a white wife.  Emily is strong enough to survive that and much more besides.  This is a wonderful, heartwarming story, and I am glad that I met these women.t I met these women.	2004-06-03

I'm not that sorry to see the end of Baxt's celebrity murder case series.  The books are not bad stories, but not great either.  I did like the many glimpses I got of famous starts from the 30's and 40's.  In this book, I particularly enjoyed Groucho Marx and W.C. Fields.  As I read the books, I found that I picked up a lot of celebrity gossip, as Baxt appears to be intimately acquainted with these glamourous people.  In this book Carole and Clark try to help Detective Villon find one of Carole's missing prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, who had been kidnapped.  While everyone is working on this case, a body of a man washes ashore at celebrity beach party.  Could these two seemingly unrelated instances be connected?  Carole thinks so, and puts her considerable intelligence to work to help the police find Lydia Austin, and to determine who killed the gangster that washed up on the beach.  It was not a bad story, with Baxt's trademark satire liberally sprinkled throughout.  For anyone who is interested in this golden era in Hollywood, this series will be worth the time.	2004-05-31

We find in this book what appears to be a quite normal, non-descript couple, but they have worked together to form a diabolical Plan.  This Plan is not supposed to bring them riches, but Myra hopes it will bring her what she feels is a well-deserved fame.  She would like recognition for what she thinks are her extraordinary gifts.  Her husband Bill has vowed to help her in this quest.  They have decided to kidnap a small girl (daughter of a rich business man), and Myra hopes to gain the fame she yearns for by supposedly directing them to the finding of this girl.  But things go terribly wrong, and instead Myra and Bill are faced with terror as they try to cover their tracks.  This is a very well-written little novelette, and it is quite different take on crime and detection.	2004-05-31

This book is quite different than the previous books in this series.  For one thing, it's actually quite humourous and although there is a murder, it happens sometime before the book actually begins.  The dead body of what appears to be a knight of the crusade is found by Catherine and Edgar in their Paris home after they've been away for a year.  The scandal from that, as well as a lot of rumours that are going around Paris about them causes them to set out to find first who the knight was, and then to determine who killed him.  This book is peopled by a lot of characters, and that can be confusing, and there is a lot of unrelated action going on, so it gets a bit disjointed at times, but it is funny, and that is very different for a Catherine LeVendeur mystery.  Ms. Newman's research is still very extensive, and her two main characters are just as likeable, so not a bad addition to this series.	2004-05-27

These three words describe Lee Child's Persuader, but you could use a lot more - terrific, heart-stopping, wonderful, but in all things it is a brutal story.  The book is named after a very sophisticated assault rifle, and the book is aptly named since it is a very sophisticated thriller that will have you turning pages from the very first.  This book is also unique in the Reacher series because we get to see a younger Reacher in it as well as the Reacher we have come to love (the loner).  There are flashbacks to when he was a military cop, and it's interesting to see that.  The guy actually does have a past.  In this book Reacher is on a personal vendetta to get someone that he thought he killed ten years before.  He meets all kinds of bad people, and on his way to exact his revenge he kills a lot of those people.  He is faced with the most dangerous adversary out there - one who has really nothing to lose, but Reacher won't quit until he gets him.  Hang onto your seats - you're in for a wild ride - and you won't be getting much else done while you're reading this book.  It's a stunner!	2004-05-25

He always seems to bumble his way to a solution in the many murders that seem to occur in his area, but underneath that shambling exterior is a mind that is as sharp as a whip.  The Hamish Macbeth series is one of my very favourite series, and even though Ms. Beaton has about 20 entries in the series it just never seems to get stale.  The characters that we meet with every book (the wonderful, eccentric citizens of Lochdubh), plus the new ones that she introduces each time are what make this series so special.  I am sad that I've now caught up to Ms. Beaton, and now I am relegated to waiting (very impatiently I might add) for the next book.  I have enjoyed every minute that I've spent with Hamish in wonderful Lochdubh.  In this book, Hamish has been bothered with a vicious poison pen writer in the neighbouring village of Braike.  He is worried because he fears that this letter campaign is going to lead to murder, and sure enough that's what happens.  He and his wonderful &quot;lady friend&quot; Elspeth work together to try to trap the writer and to find the murderer.  It turns out that they're not one and the same.  Hamish also gains the help of another young lady that is visiting Lochdubh.  She said it was for a holiday, but actually her intent was to try to ensare Hamish as a form of &quot;getting back&quot; at her uppity friend Priscilla, who even though she is engaged to be married, still seems to carry a torch for Hamish.  This series is superb entertainment, and I can give no higher accolade than that.	2004-05-21

This book is an excellent addition to the strong Peter Diamond series.  For those who like to read British procedurals written by a master of plotting and characterization, I really recommend the Peter Diamond series.  He's probably the most likeable and believable detective out there in this genre, and Lovesey displays a craftsmanship in his characterizations that is unequaled.  His main character keeps on getting better and better, but in this book we are also introduced to a new one and she is a winner.  Her name is Hen (short for Henrietta), and she's a detective from a neighbouring town who Peter collaborates with on a murder case.  She's a smart, no-nonsense, cigar-smoking woman who will brook no interference from anyone on any of her cases.  The murder occurred in her patch on a beach at a seaside resort, but the victim was a Bath citizen, so Peter is brought in to assist.  Somehow the two detectives find a working relationship that is effective and they develop a mutual respect for each other.  All the while through this book, Lovesey maintains a tight plotline, but he also has a knack for bringing in very unique puzzles that aren't that easy to figure out.  In this book the murder victim found on the beach is a woman who works as a psychological profiler for Special Branch, and Diamond and Hen can't help thinking that her murder is connected somehow to the case she has been called in to consult on.  Lovesey keeps the pace going, and the intricate plot is one that certainly kept my interest.  We also see a more laid-back and less curmudgeonly Peter Diamond.  He has somehow mellowed as he's still been trying to get over the sudden death of his wife, and it's made him even more believable and more likeable.	2004-05-20

I must admit that I was getting a little jaded, and they didn't seem as funny anymore, but this book is wonderful!  In it we see Stephanie at her fiestiest, and we get good doses of both Morelli and Ranger, as well as Lula.  Also, we see the Jersey girl on the road (or air) to Las  Vegas while she tries to capture a FTA.  This book puts her in all kinds of danger, and she's up against a real nutcase this time.  Even with Ranger's Merry Men as bodyguards, Stephanie finds herself in some pretty hairy situations.  And you can laugh at her the whole time.  There's a scene in the hospital when her sister is in labour that is sure to make you laugh outload.  Great stuff!	2004-05-17

I found that Gemma on her own as she is for most of this book is a nice touch.  Although I like Kincaid, I find him somewhat of a &quot;stuffed shirt&quot;.  I also love Scotland, and this book has some wonderful descriptions of the Scottish countryside in the spring, which to my mind would be when I would like to visit.  This book slips back and forth between two times - the present and 1898 so there is a parallel storyline here.  I think Ms. Crombie handles this very well, and she certainly makes it clear that the old adage is true - &quot;<br />The sins of the fathers are visited on the sons.&quot;  in the book Gemma's friend Hazel has asked her to accompany her to the place where she grew up for what she terms a &quot;cookery weekend&quot;, at a Bed and Breakfast.  Once they get there Gemma finds that what she thought she knew about Hazel is totally wrong, and she finds herself in the middle of a love triangle which turns into a murder.  Along the way we learn how fine whiskey is made.  A good read!	2004-05-17

She has opened up another Den of Antiquity shop there.  Abby's mother Mozelle is also living with them.  And CJ, her friend from Charlotte is visiting when the first murder occurs.  This is a humourous book, and I actually enjoyed it.  I've found that the later Den of Antiquity mysteries seem to be getting a little better.  The plots are tighter and the humour is less forced.  The book opens with Abby trying to muscle her way into the top echelon of Charleston society.  When she receives a request to have tea with the leading society lady she accepts, and takes CJ with her.  But no sooner do they leave after having tea with her, than the lady turns up dead - poisoned.  Abby needs to find the killer before the rest of society believe she is the murderer.  Throw in some antique glass and a new shop assistant that can sell ice to Eskimos, and you have the story.  Abby almost gets killed, but is saved just in time - just like usual.  In all honesty, I read these books for CJ.  She is THE best character in the stories, and she has a big part in this one.	2004-05-14

I have shamelessly enjoyed every single Monk story that Ms. Perry has written.  The Monk series has always been my favourite of her two long-running series, but this book is the best Monk story that I've read. The craftsmanship that Ms. Perry puts into each of her books is so very apparent in this one.  She shows pure genius in her character and plot development.  In this book we see Monk and his Hester working separately on what appears to be too separate catastrophic events, but as the story goes on, it is apparent that both are connected.  Hester is fighting the battle of her life against a very real foe of disease in her clinic, and Monk is out on the River trying to solve a theft and trying to piece together what actually happened on the Maude Idris.  We see some real growth in some of the regular characters, but we also meet some very strong minor characters in this book - for example - the cold and ruthless Clement Louvain; the very likeable Durban (a member of the infamous River police that Monk really feels an affinity for); and Sutton the Ratter - one of the best characters in the book.  This book held me spellbound from beginning to end.  The pace in the book is relentless, and when I finished it, it left me feeling strangely empty.  I can't wait for another Monk book!	2004-05-12

I am a huge fan of Kay Scarpetta and have enjoyed the whole series up to this one.  This book doesn't appear to be written by the same author.  For one thing the book is written in a disembodied third person rather than the first person that all the other books are written in.  This seems to make Kay into some bit player that sits on the sidelines watching all the action.  Also, the violence in this book seems more graphic than in others, and that detracts from the storyline.  And the storyline is hardly credible.  There are more coincidences than are really believable and the story seems rushed and disjointed.  The ending is really rushed, and hardly even makes sense.  And fantastically, Jean-Baptiste has escaped from a maximum security death row prison and is still at large at the end of the book.  I guess that means we will be treated to more of this &quot;larger than life&quot; monster who has an unexplained obsessison with Kay.  I had to read this book because I love this series so much, but I wish I had given it a pass.  It was a big disappointment.	2004-05-09

No one can write a village mystery like her, and her Hamish is a wonderful character.  I like him more each time out.  In this book Hamish is on a winning crusade against crime in his patch.  He cracks open a fraud ring, a nursing home scam, saves a little girl's life in a catastropic flood and uncovers a salvaging ring that is stripping a German submarine from World War II that had been downed somewhere near the village of Storye which is a village on his patch.  Usually nothing much goes on in Storye, but when Hamish makes a routine visit there, he finds that the villagers are secretive and scared.  He and his young reporter friend Elspeth try to determine what is going on in the tiny village.  Hamish is hard pressed to keep his good deeds \\"off the radar screen\\" so to speak because the last thing he wants is promotion to a larger police station.  The only thing I'm sad about after reading this book is that I have only one left to read in this long-running series.  The series has been a total delight!	2004-05-06

This is very much a historical novel, as there really is no murder and murderer to be found.  I found that the book had somewhat of a slow start, but most historical novels suffer from this problem since the author needs to build his/her character base and lay the groundwork for the unfolding of the story.  In this book Dame Frevisse and Dame Pepetua are sent to a meeting of parliament as a request of the Bishop.  He wants Dame Frevisse to listen and learn about the many political intrigues that are going on in this emergency scheduled calling of parliament.  Right away Dame Frevisse is in the middle of all the political unrests, secrets and plots and counterplots that surround King Henry VI and his uncle the Duke of Gloucester.  She finds that her brother-in-law, the Duke of Suffolk is in the middle of this, and is in fact the cause of the problems, so she must deal with her sister's concerns about her husband as well as try to thwart a truly evil plot that Suffolk has hatched.  This will become the biggest challenge of her career, and will in fact destroy her reputation (a thing that a nun does not take lightly).  Ms. Frazer is a very good writer, and this book is well-researched, but it was not what I was expecting since I wanted a medieval mystery.  I personally didn't really enjoy the story as I've read many historical mysteries about this time, and really wasn't wanting to read another about the maelstrom that surrounds an early English king's throne, but I've given it 4 stars since it is so well-written, and well-researched.  Be aware if you read it that this is not a mystery novel.	2004-05-05

The setting of 1940's California is great, and that is actually when Chandler wrote this book.  It's a classic noir mystery and I couldn't help thinking as I was reading that it should have been played by Bogie as Philip Marlowe and Bacall as the femme fatale in this story.  This would make a great movie actually.  It's a twist on the classic missing female story.  Marlowe has been hired by a big wig to find his wife.  She's been missing for a month.  As Marlowe tries to follow her tracks he gets pitted against some pretty desperate men, and he manages to get knocked on the head at least a couple of times before he figures out what happened to the woman he is hired to find.  Chandler's characterizations are great.  Marlowe is wonderful, but there are some really good bit players in this one too - for example Patton- the Sheriff from San Bernadino is actually quite wonderful.  A good old boy that happens to be as sharp as a tack and a crack shot too.  Good stuff.	2004-05-03

This was an enjoyable book in some respects, but I found that it wasn't nearly as gripping as the two previous books in this Boston gaslight series.  For one thing, there wasn't much mystery here.  We knew almost right away who the killer was, and it was just a matter of Addington running around trying to find him.  Also, we never saw a resolution to the sexual tension between Caroline and Dr. MacKenzie.  Knowing this was the last book in the series, that surprised me a bit.  In fact the book finished with lots of unresolved issues.  The book is about the Victorians fascination with seances and contacting people \\"from the otherside\\".  Caroline attends a seance to try to contact her dead mother, and while the lights were down, the man sitting beside her (in fact holding her hand) is killed.  Addington did not want Caroline to attend any seances, so he was perturbed when he found out that she had and that the unthinkable happened while she was there.  Then he finds a link from that death to the man who was in prison for fraud, and who Addington believed was responsible for the death of his father.  The man is a confidence artist, and he bilked many people of a lot money, including his and Caroline's father.  The book becomes a chase to get this man after that, and I didn't find that it was that suspenseful.	2004-04-30

Waldo's Sacajawea is probably one of my all-time favourite books, so that's why I decided to read her series on Madoc.  Although this book didn't grab me in the same way, it is still a very well-researched story about a little-known time and a historical person that not many know about.  Her descriptions are very real, and in this book are actually quite graphic because the subject matter truly reflects the way that things were back in the 11 century.  Life was short and terror, fear and superstition ruled all.  I also found that the women in the book, especially Brenda, are very well drawn and they are truly remarkable and memorable.  I think Ms. Waldo captures medieval Wales and the passions that drove men and women in these dark days very well.  We laugh with these people, grieve with them, cry with them and love with them.  That in itself is a sign of good historical novelist.  Don't be daunted by the size of the book, or by some of the reviews.  If you love historical sagas, then this book is one you shouldn't miss.	2004-04-25

I found that the antics weren't quite as slapstick.  Yes, it still is little farcical, but I found the stunts a little more funny, and Abby a little less caustic.  This series is really &quot;fluff&quot; reading, but it can be enjoyable.  Some of the characters are worth reading the books for.  My favourite is CJ.  Although we don't see as much of her as in previous books, she is still there and just as confused and funny as usual.  In this book Abby is hosting a Halloween party to warm her new home.  At the end of the party, though a body is found in a suit of armour in Abby's house, and that body is none other than her arch rival - her ex Buford's  silicone-enhanced wife Tweety.  Abby has to do some fast sleuthing to remove suspicion from herself for this one.  Who has a better motive than her, and the killing is done in her own house.

Life in Hollywood in 1953 was difficult and everyone looked at everyone else to try to figure our whether or not they were \\"commies\\".  In this book we see Fred and Ginger smack in the middle of a Russian espionage scam.  Ginger's therapist dies and Villon and Mallory know that he was poisoned.  What's his background and history?

He has been asked by a woman who was involved with his now-dead brother to help her find weak spots in the Secret Service protection of a newly-elected Vice-President.  This meeting with M.E. Froehlich opens up a little of Jack's history to us and the life that he and his older brother led while they were growing up as army brats in various army bases throughout the world.  We also see Jack request the aid of a former co-worker from the army.  Neagley is the female equivalent of Jack - brilliant, well-trained and oh so cool.  Jack and Neagley make a formidable team.  Not only do they find the weaknesses in the Secret Service protection detail, they hunt down and take retribution themselves on the bad guys that not only threatened the Vice-President, but who hurt and killed people who were close to them.  Child's writing is spare and chilling.  Yes there is violence, but it's not over-drawn and seems to flow as part of the story and helps build the terrible tension that is simmering throughout the whole book.

This book is not the strongest entry in this series.  As I finished it I felt strangely disappointed.  One of the main things that I like about the series is it's inclusion of real people into the storyline.  I guess Prince Eddy was real, but the whole scenario of his 10-year exile may or may not have happened.  Also, there is really no mystery here.  It is an espionage story, but there really isn't any mystery in that either.  We know right from the beginning almost who killed the maid, and who was involved and why.  Less explanation about these key points would make the story much more entertaining and exciting.  In this book Kate and Charles are commandeered into a mission that takes them to the historic Glamis castle in Scotland.  They find out that the prince who was heir to the throne is not dead as they had been led to believe, and that he has actually been living in the castle for the last ten years.  He has gone missing and his father (the King) has commissioned Charles to find him.  At the same time the body of one of the castle servants has been found with her throat cut.

With this book, I think that Deborah Crombie proves her right to be up there with P.D. James and Elizabeth George.  This is a beautifully written, though complex tale of love, possession, hate and evil.  In this book Gemma has a murder in her patch.  It's her first big case as Inspector, and the murder is of prominent woman who had her throat cut in her own driveway.  Gemma and her new team try to put the pieces together and as they start to do that it becomes apparent to her and to Duncan Kincaid that there are striking similarities between this case and one that happened in Duncan's territory.  They get to work together to try to prove a connection.  At the same time Duncan and Gemma are combining their households and moving in together.  It should be a completely happy time for them, but they both find that this case is going to  cause tragedy to a number of lives, maybe even their own.  This is a rich, complex, psychological thriller that is extremely complex and multi-faceted. I take my hat off to Ms. Crombie	2004-04-14

This is honestly one of my very favourite series, and each book is just as enjoyable as the last.  I'm only sad that I'm getting to the end of the series, and hope that M.C. Beaton continues to write for a good long while yet.  Hamish is a wonderful character and the eccentric people in his little village of Lochdubh are so real, that it seems they are actually real people.  In this book we meet two new characters that I hope to see more of - Elspeth, who seems to be a wonderful romantic interest for the died-in-the-wool Bachelor, Hamish and Inspector Carson who takes the place of the odious Blair when murder of famous television celebrities occurs in and around Lochdubh.  Again Hamish is thrown into a murder investigation in his quiet little village, and before he, Elspeth and Carson can solve it a few more deaths occur.  For anyone who likes their mysteries cozy, with a definite wicked comic appeal, you cannot go wrong with Hamish Macbeth.	2004-04-12

I found this a difficult book to read even though it is a solid effort by Sharan Newman.  It's more a book about the differences among faiths, Judaism and Christianity, Catholicism and other Christian sects.  It was almost appropriate that I read the book during the Easter weekend because it is actually quite a religious effort.  In this book Catherine, Edgar, Soloman and Catherine's father Hubert journey to Gernmany to save Catherine's sister Agnes who has been accused of murdering her new husband.  She had just been married to him for three weeks when he died suddenly and painfully in their bedchamber.  But readers are confronted with the religious unrest that occurred in Europe in 1146.  Ms. Newman's research is impeccable and her characterizations and plots are superb, but that does not make her books easy to read.  I found this one extremely difficult because we become so intimately acquainted with Catherine's father Hubert and his struggle to continue to deny his Jewishness while trying to keep up his Catholic front in order that he can remain available for his daughter and her young family.	2004-04-10

The answer to the question is &quot;yes&quot;, because that is how I felt with this book.  In it Stephanie has two more vehicles that get blown up plus Ranger's.  It gets a little stale after awhile.  This is still a pretty good book though because we see our old favourites - Lula, Gramma Mazur and of course Ranger and Morelli.  Some unfinished business between Stephanie and Ranger gets finished too.  I wish they could bottle and sell Ranger!  Anyway, in this book Stephanie is trying to find a missing mother and her daughter for a friend of her family, and she is thrown against a really bad dude who begins terrorizing her and her family.  Ranger really helps Steph a lot in this one because this guy is really scary!  In fact, it makes Stephanie really consider a new line of work.	2004-04-08

In this Simon Hawke's third outing for Tuck Smythe and his friend Will Shakespeare, the hijinks are there right from the first chapter.  This series is a lot of fun and the characters are the liveliest ones you'll find anywhere, especially in the historical genre.  There are enough references to famous lines from subsequent plays that Shakespeare will write to keep even a Shakespearophile happy, and for those that aren't familiar with these famous lines, the humour and light repartee will keep your interest.  In this book we are introduced to the Guild system that was prmoninent in England in the Elizabethan era.  We also get a close look at the criminal underground.  Smythe and Shakespeare set out to try to clear one of their friends of a murder charge, and it throws them into contact with a whole group of renegade trades toughs.  There are lots of brawls and hijinks before the game is done.	2004-04-06

I wondered how this book would play out after the shocking beginning, but I shouldn't have doubted Peter Lovesey's skill.  He writes a great book!  His plots and characterizations are wonderful.  In this book the curmudgeonly detective Peter Diamond is confronted with a crime that comes too close to home.  He is sidelined by the brass for this, the biggest murder case of his career, but he vows that he will use his unique talent to bring his wife's killer to justice.  There are more red herrings and leads for him to follow, and we the readers think it's a whole slew of different people, but Lovesey plays it out until the startling conclusion.  This is a thickly textured and compelling book, and it is also a watershed book for Diamond.  We wonder at the end what kind of man and detective we will have in subsequent stories.  This is probably the strongest entry in an already strong series.	2004-04-04

I've always been ambivalent about this series, and because of that I continued to read the entire series even though it would have probably been best for me to give it a skip.  I don't like nonsenical slapstick comedy, and Magdalena delivers a lot of that in each of her outings.  Also, the writing, character development and plot were fairly thin in all the books.  Actually this book is probably one of her stronger ones, but still I felt it a waste of time.  I am one that likes to finish a series once I start, but I don't have many reservations about saying that this is it for me.  In this book Magdalena is trying to help Melvin capture the killer of one her guests at her bed-and-breakfast.  The list of suspects is surprisingly short, but motive is what's hard to find.  Magdalena's dead mother gave her the hint while Magdalena paid a visit to her grave (That's what I mean about this series - it's sometimes too silly for words.)  Anyway, goodbye Magdalena and may you wail and jump to conclusions to your heart's content, but I won't be there to read about it.	2004-03-31

In this book Benjamin and his bride Rose go down to Mexico to rescue their friend Hannibal who has been accused of murdering the son of his paramour's father.  Once there they are thrown into dangerous intrigue and sadistic cruelty.  Ben and Rose have never seen a family quite like Don Prospero's.  And it appears that Hannibal did indeed kill the Don's son since no one else could have poisoned him, but Ben knows that Hannibal is incapable of murder and he and Rose set out to prove his innocence at no small risk to themselves.  This was a good book and a good mystery, but I missed the New Orleans backdrop since all the book's action occurs in Mexico. Ms. Hambly is a master-storyteller.	2004-03-29

This is a great installment in the Hamish Macbeth series.  This series continues to delight and surprise and I always can't wait to read the next one.  In this one a rather unsavoury dustman (garbage men are still called dustmen in Britain), is found dead in one of his refuse bins.  No one in Lochdubh is really sorry because this man was not well-liked by anyone in the village.  But Hamish has to set out to find the murderer, especially after another body is found.  Once he begins investigating he finds there are more suspects than he knows what to do with, but he continues in his very unorthodox way to try to put the pieces together.  There is a scene in the book with a helicopter and a hammer thrower that is absolutely hilarious.  Ms. Beaton is a master of black comedy, and her Hamish is the most likeable sleuth out there.  He's so real that he leaps off the page.  I love this series!	2004-03-25

Catherine Aird's longevity in the mystery writing genre is explained by this book.  She's been writing her CD Sloan mysteries for years, and in this, her most recent addition to the series, she still has all her skills intact.  She write mysteries that intelligent, erudite and slyly funny.  In this one a body of a woman is found dead in front of a statue right smack in the middle of a maze.  Sloan and Crosby first have to determine whether she died by her own hand or did someone else speed her to her death?  Then they have to figure out how she could have been brought into the middle of this very difficult maze.  And how do a dead rabbit and a missing goat from quite a few mile away tie in with their mystery?  I am a huge fan of Catherine Aird, and this book is as elegant and mischievious as any of the the preceeding books in her Sloan/Crosby series.	2004-03-21

This is a very strong entry in this series, and it is masterfully written.  Ms. Frazer's characters have developed and grown with each book in her long-running series.  As in all books in the series, the main characters are wonderful and the plot is strong, but in this one, the secondary characters are what stand out.  The depiction of the Clerk - Master Gruesby is so realistic that the reader can picture him as he tries to move unobtrusively through the book, but we keep being drawn back to him and his very sharp mind.  In this book Sister Frevisse and her prioress are visiting in another county.  Dame Elisabeth's cousin is dying and she asks Sister Frevisse to go with her to visit her in a neighbouring nunnery.  While there they are thrown into a web of deceipt and decreptitude. Sister Frevisse's old nemesis (the Crowner, Monsieur Montfort) has been found dead in the nunnery's private garden.  The current Crowner and Mr. Montfort's son asks Sister Frevisse for her help in finding the murderer.  The case turns out to be more complicated and evil than she expects, and ends up showing old familial rivalries and deceits.  A very good book!	2004-03-19

Like all other books in the series, this one is also a satire, and Baxt does a good job of recreating the glitz and glamour of 1930's Hollywood.  If you can get past the wild repartee and the incessant talking of the stars, this isn't that bad a book.  A Hollywood madam has let it be known that she is going to publish her little black book, and there are a number of famous names that don't want that to happen.

Her descriptions of the countryside around Glastonbury are also beautifully drawn, and it sure made me want to visit this ancient place.  She draws her main characters very well, but it's her secondary characters that seem to come alive from the page.  She is an incredibly talented writer. This book gets off to somewhat of a slow start, but once about halfway through the pace picks up and it moves very quickly.  I find this book almost has a dreamlike atmosphere to it as Ms. Crombie spins her yarn and as she decribes things from the medieval ages and how it applies to the modern-day.  Kincaid and Gemma go to Glastonbury at the request of Duncan's cousin.  While there they meet all kinds of wonderful characters - some remnants from the hippy era, a very young unwed mother, a middle-aged female vicar, and Gemma particularly is touched by the magic of the place and of the old abbey.  It turns out that ancient violence ends up cropping up in modern-day Glastonbury and Gemma and Duncan are  on the tail of a killer.  Are all the accidents and murders that are occuring around them committed by one person or more?

She has quite the story to tell him about her life with an old Texas family, and Reacher believes her - even when no one else does.  She also has a vary smart little girl that Reacher realizes that he has to protect along with her mother.  This book really shows what life can be like for people of other races (especially Mexicans) in the heart of redneck Texas in the \\"back of beyond\\".  Chid is a talented writer and his plots and characterizations are masterful.  I didn't find that this book was as much \\"edge-of-your-seat\\" suspense as the previous ones, but I found the plot more complex and that made up for it. Lucky for this poor woman who is really at the end of her tether, she manages to get Reacher into her car and once he's there, and understands the extent of her suffering, he knows he's going to stick around to help her and her daughter.

In this book he seems to be a little less edgy (almost mellow), and that's a bit of a disppointment, but this is still a good story.  Mr. Lovesey effortlessy weaves two separate story lines and somehow manages to maintain an interesting plot.  The book is deceptively low-key, but as you get into it the sense of urgency surfaces when it appears that a 20-year old murder, a modern murder and an assault and a two-century old puzzle all have something in common.  In typical Lovesey fashion, this book appears simplistic at times, but then he masterfully introduces another thread that gets Peter Diamond after the scent like a bloodhound after game.

I'm almost getting to the end of all her books, and I'm certainly sad about that.  Ms. Aird is like no one out there.  She is a little like a modern day Agatha Christie, but she's far funnier, her writing actually has more clever twists in it that most of the golden age detective writers.  If you enjoy fine writing and clever plots, I suggest that you begin to read all Ms. Aird's books.  You will totally enjoy them.  In this book we see an intelligent look at the modern day drug scene.  In her inimitable way, Ms. Aird captures this slice of humanity with a very sure hand.  A body of a young girl turns up in a 2000 year old sarcophagus that is supposed to hold an Egyptian mummy.  The girl is much fresher than 2000 years (in fact the corpse is about a week old when she is found.)

When a young recovered(?) drug addict is found dead in his rented chalet, Hamish feels that something doesn't add up.  Although Strathbane writes it off as another dead junkie, Hamish thinks the young fellow was murdered.

One thing leads to another and it turns out that Hamish is put undercover with a rather fetching Detective Inspector to expose a big drug ring in Strathbane.

She has sharp dialogue and carefully drawn characters, and her books almost make the reader feel they are partaking of a guilty pleasure because of her sly wit and slightly naughty &quot;tongue-in-cheek&quot; writing.  In this book Sloan and Crosby are called out to a Senior's manor.  No one seems surprised that a sick old lady has died, except the lady herself.  She had made arrangements to have a letter sent to her son saying that she was afraid of dying not a natural death.  By the time Sloan and Crosby are on site at the manor it appears that something very wrong has been going on there.

Sharan Newman's series is so real that it is sometimes terrible to read.  She paints a true picture of what medieval life was like and no punches are pulled.  The era and the characters come alive for the reader.  We see a realistic picture of the \\"Dark Ages\\".  Not only that, but she weaves an interesting mystery into each of her stories.  This book is one of her darkest and in it Catherine and Edgar and their small son, James go to Scotland after Edgar's terrible father has summoned them.  It is a country that is torn asunder with civil wars.  The people are barbaric and superstitious.  Catherine feels totally lost there, and it doesn't help that her and Edgar are separated from each other for most of the book.  They both face their own dangers and overcome them in order to be reuinted again at the end.  In this book we see  a true villain in Edgar's father Waldeve.  Catherine wonders how her gentle Edgar can be related to this monster.  There's a lot of hate, and from that hate real revenge that makes Scotland a dark and ominous place.  Really, the mystery in this book is secondary and not much of a one since it's easy to figure out, but this is a great historical novel and this is a cracking historical series.  It seems to get better with each entry (as well as bloodier).	2004-02-27

There is still an editing problem that is apparent in the books, but I found that there wasn't as much repetition and even less &quot;wailing&quot;.  That is an improvement.  But there is still the &quot;off the wall&quot; plot and unbelievable occurences (a car lands in a tree when shoved off the road?)  Still I found the book amusing and there is a possibility of another interesting character - young Allison holds promise.  In this book Magdalena is asked by Melvin to help him find who has poisoned one of his prisoners in his jail cell.  Magdalena goes off in hot pursuit of some really strange female suspects.  Anyway, we found out &quot;who done-it&quot; in the end.	2004-02-24

Bogie comes across pretty realistic, and the sneak peaks that we get at big names is always fun in these books.  This book's time frame is supposed to take place around the time that Bogart was filming the Maltese Falcon, and the story runs a parallel storyline to that great Dashiell Hammett story, only in this case they're looking for a missing cornucopia filled with priceless jewels.  The stakes are high and before the missing artifact is found, three bodies are found.  One of the killed was Bogie's and his wife Mayo's housekeeper so Bogie feels he must get involved in order to solve the mystery of who killed her in his house.	2004-02-22

There are a number of very glaring coincidences in this book and I think that this is the biggest problem with the book.  For example, how could a case that Kay's Lucy is working for AFTA in Miami have anything to do with a homicidal maniac in Kay's town of Richmond?  But in spite of this glaring inconsistency, I still enjoyed the book.  We see Kay at her most vulnerable here and to those of us who have followed her story from the beginning, it is understandable.  This book takes place a year after Kay's lover, Benton was killed in the line of duty, and in typical Kay fashion, she has really not dealt with her feelings about that.  She has been burying herself in her work as usual.  The killer that is stalking Kay's city forces her to deal with some &quot;unlaid-to-rest&quot; issues surrounding Benton's death.  This is quite a dark book, but an edge-of-your-seat thriller that keeps the reader guessing until the end.  We also see some real character development in some of the main characters; particularly Marino and Kay herself.  It is so important that this series be read in order, and unless it is I don't think readers get the true scope of the series, and they certainly can't see the character development that occurs in each subsequent book.	2004-02-21

I do admit that it probably isn't my favourite Qwill book, but it is still a charming tale anyway.  In it we see Qwill and the indomitable KoKo trying to make sense out of two killings - one on Qwill's property by the lake and one in Milwaukee.  To Qwill and his &quot;smart cat&quot; there is one thing that these two killings have in common, and the arrival of a woman to the town of Brr, seems to have some connection.  She's someone who used to live there, but has been gone for a long time.  Don't worry, it will all make sense in the end, and Qwill and KoKo manage to identify the person responsible for these strange goings on.  Ms. Braun's books are still charming and wonderful - and great escapist reading.	2004-02-18

I have read some excellent examples of stories where the feelings and actions that have occured in the present have come about because of some of the protaganists' histories.  Jill McGown and Elizabeth George both have wonderful examples of this type of sub-genre.  This one attempts this, but it seems to fall flat in a way.  The ending seems hurried somehow, and the two storylines don't seem to flow together until they meet explosively.  I thought the book seemed long as I was reading, and it just didn't seem to gel.  I really enjoyed \\"Dreaming of the Bones\\", and was looking forward to this book, so I was disappointed.  Also, the relationship with Gemma and Duncan seems to stagnate.  There is no sexual tension, and the relationship seems to be struggling and neither one seems to notice and to do something about it.  Hopefully the next book will be better, and we get back to some of the writing that we've seen in this series.	2004-02-16

I always have a problem with giving Tamar Myers' stories a rating.  The idea behind the books is usually a good one, and there is some humour, but they are truly lacking in some key areas.  Ms. Myers really needs an editor for her books.  She contradicts herself throughout the books.  Also, she requires some help in basic writing skills.  She overuses a lot of words consistently (ie: wailing).  Also, her main characters are quite rude, and there comes a time when that is no longer that funny.  I always thought Abigail was less abrasive than Magdalena, but in this book I couldn't tell the difference.  In this book, Abigail stumbles upon what might be a priceless work of art hidden behind a hideous copy that she purchased at a church bazaar.  It turns out that some truly nasty people knew what was hidden behind the terrible front picture and are after Abby and her family in order to get the priceless work back.  The other characters in the book are still likeable, Abby's mother, CJ and some of the characters we see only in this book are fairly well drawn, but it's hard to enjoy all this with the glaring errors.	2004-02-12

The Peter Diamond series is a great series, and this book is a good one.  Peter is suffering from the stress of lack of work in Bath.  Then there seems to be a lot of unexplained suicides on his patch.  He begins by investigating one of them, and it turns out to have a lot of unexplained puzzles.  Could it be murder?  And what about the other suicide?  Introduce a young girl with unexplained amnesia and Peter's got more puzzles than he knows what to do with.  Lovesey characterizations are wonderful and this book is no different.  It's complicated, neat and has a great plot.	2004-02-11

He's charming and endearing.  This book portrays the life of an aging mystery writer in the way only M.C. Beaton can.  A television company is going to serialize some of Patricia Murtyn-Broyd's old, out-of-print books, which puts Ms. Priscilla over the top.  But then people begin mysteriously dying.  Is this potential revial to her books going to go up in smoke?  Hamish is on the case (minus his Priscilla this time), and you can bet he solves it, but not before uncovering more twists and turns and potential murderers than he knows what to do with.  Again Hamish steals the book.  He is the most endearing sleuth out there right now.	2004-02-08

This entry in the Benjamein January series is another winner.  It does start out a little slow, but Barbara needs time to set the scene for her books.  She immerses her readers so completely in her era and genre, that it's sometimes hard to surface to the modern world once beginning her books.  Even though the book starts a bit slow, it builds to explosive force about half-way through and doesn't let up right until the end.  Ms. Hambly's writing is absolutely dazzling, and Benjamin and his Rose are so real, that it's hard to believe that it's only fiction.  The book takes place in the summer of 1835 and the main part of the action is set in some of the islands located around New Orleans.  In it Ben and Rose are trying to stop a slave revolt.  As they both know, everyone loses if slaves revolt.  In the book we see gun runners, pirates, a hurricane and some old diseases that no longer are such a threat to humanity.  This is a magically rich and poignant tale, and one of the strongest entries in this already strong series.  Each book seems better than the one preceeding.	2004-02-07

This book is so hot, you burn your fingers while you turn the pages.  Stephanie is out dealing with the dregs of society while she tries to bring in her bond jumpers.  But in this one she's got two new roommates.  Grandma Mazur has moved in with her and she's acquired a part Golden Retriever dog called Bob.  Stephanie's mentor and friend Ranger is in trouble in this one.  It appears that he was seen leaving the scene of a fire where a corpse that had been shot was found.  Stephanie's boss Vince wants him brought in, but Steph can't convince herself that Ranger could possibly have killed someone, and like she says, &quot;he's smoke&quot;, so how could she catch him.  But she tries to help him and by doing so gets involved in a mafia gang turf war that almost costs her her life.  This book rollicks through to the conclusion like only Evanovich can.  It's unputdownable, and the best in the series so far.	2004-02-04

This book is a &quot;dilly of a book&quot;, and I couldn't believe how much I had missed China.  Ms. Albert cannot write these books fast enough for my taste.  This is a great China Bayles book.  In it China is trying to find the killer of a local business lady who runs a pickle factory.  As she delves deeper into the past, she finds more suspects and motives for murder than she knows what to do with.  In the book we see some of our favourites-Ruby, Janice, McQuaid, but we also see China, and that's what makes this series.  Reading this book is like catching up with some old friends. There's also some fabulous recipes in the book.	2004-02-03

In it we see the incomparable Miss Bette Davis as she takes up residence in England while waiting for her contract court case with Warner Brothers.  She is staying in an archeologist's house and while there the archeologist is found dead in his own study.  Bette is thrown in with her neighbour, none other than Agatha Christie the famous mystery writer to and they're trying to solve a murder.  Before the book is done another death occurs, and the story rushes to its conclusion.  The setting of the book only takes place over a 12-hour stretch and a lot happens in that time frame.  Bette gets a taste of what a truly disfunctional family is like.  The book was OK and there are lots of twists and turns, but I didn't find that it showed the true Bette.  It missed somehow.  She was a multi-faceted woman and a wonderful actress, but this book falls short a bit in its depiction of her true character.  The mystery is fun though, and if read in the context of a satire is well worth it.	2004-01-31

This is a really strong entry in the Hamish Macbeth series.  In it we see a dentist from the neighbouring village of Braikie get murdered.  He was apparently not a very good dentist, and was rather fond of &quot;drawing the tooth&quot; rather than repairing it, but Hamish has an incredible toothache, and needs it taken care of right away.  He goes to this dentist and finds him dead in his chair.  As he delves into the life of Dr. Gilchrist, he finds angry husbands and jilted lovers galore in his past.  The problem is not who has the motive, but which one.  Hamish sets out to find the murderer in his unpreposessing, but charming way.  I really like this series.  The people from the sleepy little village of Lochdubh and it's neighbouring villages are eccentric and delightful.  It's always fun to see what they're up to next.  My personal favourite is the fisherman with the nagging wife - Archie Macleod.	2004-01-29

One is that the books need to be edited since there are usually quite a few mistakes.  The other is that Magdalena's stories and sayings get very repetitive after awhile.  I'm glad to say that this book seems to have addressed my first complaint a bit.  There are not so many glaring editorial mistakes.  Unfortunately, not so for the second complaint.  It is still repetitive, but Ms. Myers does introduce some new sayings, and does not dwell so much on Magdalena's stories.  In this book one of the only &quot;bad&quot; Amish cooks in the world dies from an overdose of &quot;angel dust&quot;.  Now how did a religious, simple person like Lizzie Mast ingest a recreational drug?  Magdalena is deputized by her nemesis Melvin to find out.  As usual she unmasks the killer with some risk to herself, but before she does that she discovers that recreational drugs are not so unheard-of in the young Amish community.  I enjoyed this book much more than I have the other most recent additions to the series.  And Magdalena is still funny.	2004-01-28

Her books are very complex and they are quite brilliantly written.  This book is even more sweeping and majestic than the previous two in the David Beckett Series (Firedrake's Eye and Unicorn's Blood).  If you want explosive historical fiction that is absolutely beautifully written and plotted, then I recommend this series.  You probably shouldn't read this particular book on it's own either since the other two are required in order for the reader to fully appreciate all of Ms. Finney's characters.  This book is written about the Spanish Armada and the Spaniards attempt to take England in 1587.  It gives quite a unique perspective to this historical fact, and the book is peopled with characters who are also brilliant and alive.  We see our old favourites - David Beckett and Simon Ames, but we meet some wonderful new characters - Merula, Snake, the Padrone and some truly evil villains - Pasquale and Edward Dormer.  This book is not for the faint of heart either because Ms. Finney is just as descriptive with her killings, maimings and tortures, as she is with her bird's eye view of the sea from the deck of a Spanish galliasse and the most descriptive portrayal of an early sea battle that I've ever read! This is a wonderful, heartwarming and heartrending book that will tear you apart as you read it.	2004-01-26

She is a &quot;dab hand&quot; at all types of mysteries, and in this book she turns her attention to an English medical thriller.  As with all her books, this one is sharp, clear and concise.  Her sense of humour and her excellent mastery of the English language are both apparent in this book.  The book is about a series of medical deaths (not that surprising since the patients were elderly and quite sick), but then one of the doctor's is found murdered.  Sloan and Crosby follow a whole bunch of sub plots and threads before they can unmask the killer, but before they do that more people seem to die.  This is a lively and intelligent book.	2004-01-21

I do agree that this is the best Sister Frevisse mystery I've read so far, but they have been getting better and better.  I found that this one moved a lot quicker than previous ones, and that was because of the many plots and subplots that were interwoven in the fabric of the story.  I also enjoyed the realistic look at medieval English village life.  It also is well-researched and gave us a clear idea of what illness outbreaks were like back then.  In this book the little village is hit with a measles outbreak, and many children get sick.  Another thing that I liked about the book was that it was out of the nunnery entirely.  In this book, Sister Frevisse is actually out in the village trying to do the job of the bailiff while he is under house arrest for an allegation of being a villein (serf) on the lam.  We meet some very interesting characters and as usual Ms. Frazer's dialogue is crisp and intelligent.  An excellent addition to the Sister Frevisse stories.	2004-01-20

I read a lot of the reviews for this book, and I really don't agree with most of them.  I think that this book is an extremely good example of Ms. Cornwell's chilling writing.  The dialogue and the plot are crisp and the detail is incredible.  We find out a lot about fire investigation in this book.  Yes, I admit Ms. Cornwell does get rather graphic and &quot;over-the-top&quot; in her violence, but that is what makes a Kay Scarpetta book so Unputdownable.  I do agree with others, that readers must read this series in order.  A lot of what happens in each book is a take off from what happened in a previous one.  It would be confusing if you started partway through.  Also, the character development progesses with each book, so the reader needs to get inside Kay's head and see things in the way she would have.  In this book, we see a previous villain come back to haunt Kay and the people that she loves.  Kay is called in to a fire investigation where a body is found burned beyond recognition.  The more she digs into the case, the more disturbed she becomes and she realizes that she is dealing with true monster who probably had committed many murders before this one.  Also, the more she digs, the more it becomes apparent that an old nemesis (Carrie Grethen) is somehow behind these terrible crimes.  Her, Benton, Lucy and Marino set out to find a killer and one of the truly evil people that she has ever encountered.  Before the final twist of the plot at the end, Kay suffers a very personal tragedy.  We will have to read how that has affected her in the next installment.	2004-01-15

Even before I read her afterword, where she said she went the way of this pilgrimmage as part of her research, I thought that she had.  There is such a wealth of detail in each of her books.  Her characters too are very real, and there is a lot of character development in this particular book.  In this book Catherine and her Edgar set out on a pilgrimmage to St. James tomb in Spain.  They hook up with a bunch of fellow pilgrims and stay with that group for the duration.  Catherine's father, uncle and cousin are also part of the group.  Along the way, death seems to be following a certain group of elderly knights, and it's up to Catherine and Edgar to determine who among them is killing off these old men in such bizarre and violent ways.  And why these men?  This is certainly a motley crew of pilgrims, and the reader really gets to know them in this story.  A cracker!	2004-01-13

I like the Abigail Timberlake series a bit more than Magdalena Yoder because Abigail is a little less abrasive, and I find there's not as much background repetition in these books like there is in the Penn-Dutch series.  This book is a fun read as we see Abby coming home from a holiday to an empty shop (she was robbed while she was out of the country).  So in order to regroup she and her wonderful friend CJ go to a manor house for a weekend of parlour games.  They come across a truly disfunctional family, and while there the maid is found dead in her bed.  This sends Abby on a quest to find a killer, since CJ has been arrested for the murder.  The best part of this book is CJ herself.  She's a wonderful character.  The worst part is the ending.  It seems hurried and doesn't make a lot of sense.  But Abby unmasks the killer, and saves CJ so all's well that ends well.	2004-01-10

Her Sloan/Crosby series is truly delightful.  She uses wry humour, tongue-in-cheek and puns like an expert, but the plot and story do not suffer from this.  Her plots are complex and she enters into all kinds of fields.  In this book an elderly lady passes away from what seem to be natural causes, but the preparations she has made in the event of her death are so complex, that it alerts Sloan and his team that there is something more to this.  Before he's done figuring out the mystery, he's had to probe into history from the Second World War.  The story is told with elegance and style, and is as sharp as tacks.  Catherine Aird knows how to write a mystery.	2004-01-08

There were lots of plots and subplots so that it was a bit difficult to follow, but if you pesevere you'll read an intriguing book with a great mystery.  We see lots of character development here - Benjamin, Rose, Hannibal and even Ben's younger sister Dominique.  And no one can touch Ms Hambly for beautiful descriptions and dialogue!  In this book we get a first-hand view of what opera was like in these times - compare it and the personalities or stars to motion pictures today.  Audiences loved and hated their favourite opera stars, and everyone in that industry was after their &quot;15 minutes of fame&quot;.

The &quot;locked-room&quot; aspect of the book was very well done, and Peter Lovesey is an excellent author.  I love Peter Diamond, but that's where I felt the book fell down a bit.  I read these books because Peter Diamond is such a wonderful character, but I found that he wasn't as real in this one as in the previous three that I've read.  He's still an accident-prone curmudgeon, but I didn't see the human side as much.  Maybe that's because we didn't see much of his wonderful wife Stephanie .  She is a wonderful foil to the irascability of Diamond.  But the book is good nontheless.  It's a page-turner and keeps you guessing until the end.  We see the inevitable twisted mind as the perpetrator of these fantastic crimes.	2004-01-04

Dreaming of the Bones is a wonderful book, and the title reflects the storyline.  The way Ms. Crombie slides in and out of the past with the book is almost dreamlike.  In this book, Duncan Kincaid and his Gemma are trying to solve what could have been a five year old murder, but while they're trying to convince the authorities that it was murder and not suicide another death occurs that can't be anything but murder.  Kincaid has to determine what happened years and years ago to try to figure out who has committed these murders.  In his search he comes upon some truths of his own that will probably change his life completely.  It's a voyage of discovery for him as well as revenge.  Despite the few discrepancies this book seemed to be more British than the others that I have read in this series.  Ms. Crombie should do a bit of research to determine how the English spell &quot;colour&quot;, but it did not take away from the story, and I really did enjoy it!	2004-01-02

In this book Stephanie's bounty hunting has reached a low point since there don't seem to be many bail jumpers, but she gets talked into trying to find her Uncle Fred who disappeared from a grocery store parking lot.  Sounds easy, but in true Plum fashion she bites off way more than she can chew.  I lost track of the number of vehicles that she wrecked.  And did I mention Ranger?  We see lots of him in this one and he's a peach!  Dangerous as can be, but still a peach, and Steph finds herself losing her head a little over him.  You'll have to read to see what happens between them.  A Stunner of a book!	2003-12-31

This is the twelfth entry in the Hamish Macbeth series, and it's a winner!  Probably my favourite so far.  I just don't know how MC Beaton does manage to keep Hamish and his series so fresh and delightful.  She is a superb author and characterizes like no one else in the business!  In this book Hamish is up against a village bully and braggart, and then the bully turns up dead.  All of the police force believe they have their killer (after all he even confessed), but only Hamish doesn't think they've got the right man.  He goes out sleuthing on his own, and sets himself up against all the police brass.  He is at his best in this book, and for those who haven't had the pleasure of entering Hamish's world, this book wouldn't be a bad place to start.  Quite Wonderful!	2003-12-31

But, the books are so repetitive, and overusage of certain words take away from the story, and this repetiveness certainly takes away from the humour that is supposed to be behind each scene.  Still some of the characterizations are good, but my favourite character, Frenie, doesn't appear that much in this one.  In spite of these shortcomings the reader gets a real sense of the Pennsylvania-Dutch country and the lifestyles of the Amish and Mennonites.	2003-12-30

This may not have been my favourite Kay Scarpetta, but I still enjoyed it to the point where I didn't want to put it down.  I find that Dr. Kay is getting more and more human with each book, and that's a good thing!  In my estimation though, Ms. Cornwell dwells too much on the homosexual angle with each book.  This leads me to question Lucy's authenticity since she seems less and less real with each book.  I think the books would be improved without her character.  Ms. Cornwell tries too hard with her, and it shows.  But Kay, Benton and Marino are real characters.  In this book we don't see as much of Marino and that's a loss.  The story is intense and gripping, and the tension really doesn't ease up.  The book deals with biological terrorism, and that is certainly a hot topic right now.  For those of us Scarpetta lovers who love a tense and gripping tale with lots of forensics, this book does not disappoint.	2003-12-29

She has been arrested for murder of one of her father's employees, and responds to the accusation with total silence.  Sloan is put on the case because of the demise of the officer that had been previously investigating, and he has to determine whether Lucy is indeed guilty.  It brings a whole bunch of things to the Berebury Police detachment including the African kingdom of Dlasa and some high profile civil engineering projects.  Even though I figured out the means and who did the deed, it was still an interesting read as all of Ms. Aird's books are.	2003-12-26

This is one of the best Hamish Macbeth books in this lengthy series.  In this book Hamish is on vacation and, wouldn't you know that murder does folloow him there.  He meets some new friends, and finds it difficult to accept that one of them is the killer.  Yes, the man that was killed was an odious drunkard, and no one liked him, but Macbeth feels that no murder is acceptable, and feels he has to bring the guilty one to court.  During the book, he suffers an aching personal loss, and that and the way he deals with it make him more likeable and endearing than ever.  This is a totally wonderful series, and this is one of the best entries in it.	2003-12-24

In it we do get to see the Duke of Orleans who was held captive in England for a total of twenty-five years, and we do see the intrigue that was behind his long period as a royal hostage.  But the book was a slow-starter, and it really didn't pick up the pace until maybe just at the end.  Also, even though we find out who was behind the murder and attempted killings, no one was brought to justice because of political repercussions.  I hope the next book gets back to life at Sister Frevisse's nunnery.  She seemed a bit out of place as a guest in her cousin's huge home.	2003-12-23

Child's portrayal of villains is so believable that it can scare the pants off you.  Not only that he writes with such intesnsity, that the story just grips the reader until the end.  His portrayal of Jack Reacher is insightful and believable as well.  Reacher is a true drifter with uncommon talents which he has picked up in his previous life as an MP in the US Army.  He's big and brawny, and extremely quick-thinking.  In this book he is pitted against a villain that's just about as evil as they get, and he almost loses his life in the process of trying to protect someone who is very dear to him.  This is a solid thriller, with enough action to keep the reader gong well into the night.	2003-12-21

I also enjoyed this story for the Christmas message that it sent.  It's only a small novelette, but it's full of  delight.  Ms. Perry can take us into her Victorian world like no one else can, and it's an almost illicit pleasure!  Surely it can't be right or legal to enjoy these books so much!  But it is and it doesn't need to be a guilty pleasure either.  In this book we see a young Lady Vespasia setting out on a horrific winter journey in order to provide moral support for one of her friends who has been entrusted with a mission.  During the journey Vespasia pieces together the details of the tragedy that occurred a year and a half ago, and how it caused a young woman to jump over the bridge into a freezing lake.  Powerful stuff here.	2003-12-17

Ms. Myers' characterizations are usually quite good, and that doesn't disppoint in this book, but the plot is definitely disjointed, and when the real murderer is found I couldn't help but think, &quot;Where did that come from?&quot;  There is simply no way that the story led to that murderer.  It was a real surprise, but not a surprise that made any sense at all.  The one unique thing about this book was that we got to see Abigail Timberlake and Magdalena Yoder in the same book, as Abby goes on a road trip to Hernia, Penssylvania on the trail of her murderer and forger.	2003-12-17

It perfectly describes Miss Mae West as she was in the 30's - outrageous, campy and surprisingly generous.  She was a very warm human being, and totally aware of what she was and what she wasn't.  After all she created herself and marketed herself in a way that few actresses did in that day and age.  In this book there are a series of murders of Mae West impersonators, and Detective Villon works with Mae to try to find the killer before the real Mae West became a victim.  The crescendo builds up until it culminates in a bizarre Halloween party held at an infamous nightclub.  More murders occur, but Mae manages to avoid it, and then gets ready to set up the denouement in the most curious place you'll ever find.	2003-12-15

Sloan's most bizarre case to date, a human finger turns up on a walkway in the country.  This sends Sloan and his inimitable sidekick Crosby on the trail to find a corpse, and then to find a murderer.  Those readers who don't like British Procedurals done in the classic format probably don't appreciate Catherine Aird as much as those of us that do like these, but she writes wonderful mysteries.  The plots are always tight, and the characters are drawn very well, and everything is done so understated and so verry, verry, British.  She writes with a tongue-in-cheek at all times, and the understated remarks and asides that come from her detective are wonderful.  They are funny, warm and human.  We also see a good example of the &quot;long arm of the law&quot; in this book as Sloan gets help from everywhere to track his killer.  Wonderful little book, and one of the best puzzlers in this series.	2003-12-12

Hamish is sleuthing on his own in the small neighbouring village of Drim.  He's the only one that thinks that murder most foul has been committed there.  He puts his professional life on the line to first of all prove that murder was done, and then to show who actually committed it.  Hamish is his usual laconic, endearing self.  No wonder that the books of Hamish Macbeth have started a cult of followers over here across the pond from where MC Beaton and her fictional characters live.  As in other books there is a sense of despair but a true sense of warmth as well.  Her books in this series in particular are prime examples of black comedy. And her characterizations are absolutely wonderful with each outing.	2003-12-11

For those who like British Procedurals done in the classic style, you won't find any better than these.  The plots are tight, the characters plausible, and the puzzle a real puzzle.  In this book Sloan is investigating the death of a man who was found in water, but who didn't die in water.  As he investigates, he comes across a motley array of suspects - an old boatman who seems to see everything, a museum curator, an owner of a sheep farm and an architect.  The trick is to find out the motive, and then it would illuminate who the murderer was.  But before he does that he uncovers two more deaths - one old and one new, and he has to rush to avoid another one.  Murderers seem to find it easier with each subsequent death.  You must take the time to read this series.  They're as perfect a little puzzle as you'll get anywhere.	2003-12-09

At first I wasn't enjoying Gemma and Duncan Kincaid, but the series has been getting better with each entry, and this book is the best so far.  My biggest complaint in the previous entries was that Duncan Kincaid seemed to be a &quot;lame duck&quot;.  In this book we find a stronger, more rounded Kincaid, and it certainly makes the book better.  This is a stylish mystery done in the British procedural style.  We have Duncan and Gemma investigating the brutal murder of a high-ranking police officer.  The murder places them in the middle of a small English Village (Surrey).  Village politics are apparent here, but there is also danger and psychological undercurrents, and before Duncan and Jemma can solve the case they are placed right in the middle of this, and at imminent danger to themselves.  This is a solid police procedural.	2003-12-08

James is by far the best mystery novelist around. Her writing, plot and character development are unsurpassable. This book is no different. It's powerful and suspenseful, and a true psychological thriller. There are a lot of copycats out there, but none can touch Ms. James. In this book Dalgliesh investigates a gruesome murder at a small private museum. This museum is dedicated to displays of art, literature, pop culture, etc. in the years in Britain between the two great wars, and one of the displays is a \\"murder room\\" where information is set out about infamous murders that happened during this time in English history. When the first murder occurs, it looks like a copycat from one of the earlier murders. Before Dalgliesh and his team can solve the first murder another body turns up which reinforces the copycat theory. Dalgliesh manages to solve the cases, but not before we see a lot of unexpected complications. James can magically transcend genres and she accomplishes that brilliantly with this novel.	2003-12-05

It's fast-paced, funny and believable in a strange way.  In this book, Stephanie is trying to collar a waitress who jumped bail after she was arrested for stealing her boyfriend's car.  Sounds simple doesn't it?  Well, not in Stephanie's world!  She finds herself in all kinds of trouble, and without a car and a home because of fallout from this case.  But in true Stephanie fashion she seems to come out on top.  She meets a new friend - a six foot four inch drag queen called Sally Sweet (boy I hope we see more of him in the future), and she actually takes her so-called relationship with Morelli to another level.  This is my favourite Plum so far.	2003-12-04

In this one Falco becomes embroiled in a court case and we actually get to see him in action in a court room. Falco and his associates (his two brother-in-laws) are hired to help a young senator as he fights to defend himself from the accusation of killing his father. On the way they become exposed to one of the most disfunctional families you'll ever come across. This liaison could end up costing Falco his whole net worth and then some, because if a court case is brought against someone and they are judged innocent, the advocate is ordered by the court to pay compensation which is determined by the rank of the individual who was accused. Ms. Davis books keep getting better it seems. She manages to keep her Falco interesting and fun through each of them. I haven't enjoyed a series so much since Brother Cadfael.	2003-12-03

It is very difficult to read this book of Ms. Hambly's because her portrayal of slavery and the slave's lot in 19th century America is so real.  The book is filled with horror from cover to cover, but there is warmth, fellowship and love there too.  When people are together in misery very lasting and strong bonds and friendships are forged, and Benjamin January rediscovers this when he goes undercover on a cane plantation to try to determine who is behind all the accidents and deaths occuring on his old master's plantation.  January certainly has no love for Simon Fourtier, but he can't help going to help because if tragedy occurs to the white folks on a plantation, it can't help but be felt by the slaves, and they usually end up suffering the more for it.  January goes to help, and goes to work as a field hand with the threat of being plunged back into the slave's life very real to him.  He makes some lasting friendships, but at the same time uncovers an evil so grotesque that he can hardly take it in.  Luckily for Ben, his old friend Hannibal and Abishag Shaw come to his rescue before he is actually &quot;sold down the river&quot;.  Ms. Hambly's research is very extensive, and she captures this era better than anyone I've read.	2003-12-02

For those readers who love British procedurals, I can't believe that you haven't discovered Peter Diamond!  Lovesey's character is the most emgaging you will find in a month of Sundays.  In this third book in the series, Peter Diamond is summoned back to Bath CID to help capture a killer that he had had put away 4 years ago.  Apparently, this killer had pulled off an escape from prison, and kidnapped the daughter of  a policeman high up in the CID in order to get Diamond to prove his innocence of the crime that he had put him away for.  Diamond teams up with Julie Hargreaves and they manage to outwit all the CID and the Bath police force and determine that this ex-convict was indeed innocent.  Then they have the job of proving who actually did the crime, and let me tell you, it was a real surprise to me.  Diamond is a gem, and I love this series.	2003-11-29

Ms. Penman's charaterization is as wonderful as always in this third book of Justin deQuincy.  Even though she writes of a long-dead era and of historical figures, her characters come to life in her books.  Her historical research is impeccable, and she weaves real with imaginary into a glowing tapestry that leaves the reader breathless.  This is the best in the &quot;the Queen's Man&quot; series, and my only regret is that she can't seem to write her books fast enough for my taste.  I have read all of her historicals, and now three of her mysteries, and I can hardly wait for the next one (in either genre).  This book takes place in the summer and fall of 1193, and Queen Eleanor is again trying to raise a &quot;king's ransom&quot; to free her favourite son, King Richard.  She calls on all corners of the kingdom to supply ransom money and goods, and while one of the ransoms is making it's way to London it gets stolen.  Eleanor sends her man Justin de Quincy to Wales to find the ransom.  And of course wherever Justin goes, murder soon follows.  But it's the wonderful characters that make the book so special.

In it we see a newly promoted Hamish trying to put up with a trying police constable (P.C Willie Lamont).  All Hamish wants is the privacy of his home back without the arduous efforts at cleaning by Willie.  A man can't even relax in his home - Hamish thinks.  Then something happens to really upset the applecart in the village of Lochdubh.  A &quot;traveller&quot; arrives in town, and seems intent on staying.  Hamish, for some reason can't stand the man, but all the village ladies seem to think he's marvellous, at first.  Then it appears that some of the women in town have had a sudden change in personality, and the peace of Locdubh is ruined.  When Sean, the traveller, is found bludgeoned to death in his trailer (or caravan as the English call it), Hamish can't help breathing a sigh of relief, but peace doesn't return and he realizes that it won't until he finds the killer.  Hamish is his usual lovable and charming self, but he finds he has to get tough with some long term Locdubh residents in order to get to the truth.  This is probably one of my favourite Hamish stories so far.	2003-11-25

This is by far the best book so far in this series.  The medieval flavour is very strong and the characterizations are quite wonderful.  The mystery itself is an easy one to figure out and the actual murder does not occur until the near the end of the book, but the plot leading up to this is very vivid and has the right atmosphere and sense of time and place.  In this book we see Sister Frevisse at odds with the prioress in her convent.  She must fight against her dislike and distrust of Dame Alys in order to be able to deal with the problems beseiging St. Frideswide's.  Not only are Dame Alys' many relatives taxing the nunnery's provisions with their extended stay, but the relatives also bring danger to St. Frideswide's.

Someone without one of these traits would just look at this book in astonishment and wonder why it was written, and they probably wouldn't take the time to read it.  But for those of us who love Koko and Yum Yum, this book is a real treasure.  It's heartwarming and wonderful!  Ms. Braun is the piece de resistance in the cozy genre and she proves it with this little anthology of rhymes, stories and anecdotes about those fabulous felines of Qwill's.

The book also has a little thicker plot than usual as Magdalena gets drawn into a reunion of World War II vets who have rented out rooms in her newly rebuilt inn.  (the first inn was apparently destroyed by a tornado sometime between this book and the one previous).  We also meet a new character that I hope we see more of - Strubbly Sam.

She does her homework on the historical facts for the time that she writes in (12th century France), and the authenticity of these facts, combined with her compelling character development make for a &quot;page-turner&quot; of a read.  Catherine and her Edgar are the liveliest set of sleuths out their in the historical genre.  In this outing Catherine's father have asked Edgar and Catherine to find a religious relic that has been stolen from Edgar's home country of England.  Those following the relic's progress think it has made its way into France.  Not only do we get to follow our protaganists in their search, but we get a clear picture of what relations were like between the Christians and the Jews in Paris in the 12 century.  Ms. Newman's plotting is as good as her characterization, and this is a very enjoyable medieval.	2003-11-20

My main complaint with this book is Kay's niece, Lucy.  She is not a believable character, and I find her even more unbelievable in this book.  My main reason for this is that I don't think an agency like the FBI would have an untrained, young agent like Lucy involved at the heart of their big cases.  Yes, I realize she's supposed to be a genius, but seriously, please!!  But other than Lucy, I like the other characters, and they are developing very nicely.  My favourite is of course, Marino.  In this book Kay and Marino are trying to determine the cause of death of a diver that is found dead in the water in an old ship graveyard.  Everyone is trying to convince them that it was an accident or suicide, but Kay knows differently, and both her and Marino know that there is very real evil surrounding this death.  As they dig deeper, the true extent of the evil is revealed to all, many lives are at stake.  This book, like all the others in the series is chock-full of suspense from the opening paragraph right to the very end.	2003-11-15

This book is full of secrets and betrayals, and VI gets caught up in the middle of a conspiracy that actuallly began 50 years previously.  It's been a couple of years since we've heard from V.I., and things have happened in her world - the World Trade Centre, threats of terrorism and Homeland Security, and the love of her life - Morrell has been over in Afghanistan doing wartime reporting.  Although Vic misses him terribly, she's trying hard not to look like a clinging female, and continues to pursue her own career in Chicago.  She is still chasing bad guys and risking her life trying to uphold law and order.  She is asked by one of her more well-heeled clients to determine who has been using his family anscestral home.  Although the mansion is supposedly empty, this client's elderly mother still sees lights on inside the building late at night.  Looks fairly straightforward until V.I. accidentally falls into the old ornamental pool on the grounds and discovers a dead man.  Then she is whirled into a maelsrtom of intrigue, secrets, Communist plots and racism that almost causes her to lose her own life.  Paretsky writes a great yarn, and her characters are the most three-dimensional you'll see in this genre.  She is without peer in the mystery writing field!  Awesome book!	2003-11-11

This happens just after the woman had left her shop after unsuccessfully trying to interest her in an ugly gray vase.  Anyway pursuit of this particular murder puts Abby shoulder-to-shoulder with the creme de la creme of Rock Hill population.

This is the third Crombie book I've read, and I did enjoy this one marginally more than the other two.  The story and plots and and counterplots were more detailed and more believable (for the first part of the book anyway).  I agree with the others that the last part of the book bogs down a lot.  Also, I'm sorry but Duncan Kincaid is a &quot;lame duck&quot; and I find I have trouble liking him.  He seems to fall for any female that comes his way, and he seems to lack a spine.  I do like Gemma though.  She manages to carry the book, even though her infatuation with Duncan lessens her sensibiity somewhat.  I am a huge British procedural fan, so I find that this series lacks authenticity and I never forget that it's not written by an English author.  The book did have possibility though.  The 20 year time frame, and unresolved issues helped pull it out of the mundane and make it somewhat interesting.  But it's one-dimensional and forced (at least for the last 1/4 of the book anyway).	2003-11-08

Marlene Dietrich is the epitome of glamour even in this day and age.  There has never been anyone like her in Hollywood.  And in this book we see her in all her glory.  Baxt's character depictions are very real and are definitely the strong point in his &quot;silver screen mysteries&quot;.  We also see many cameo appearances by other favourites - Cary Grant, and my personal favourite, Tallulah Bankhead.  In this story one of Marlene's guests at a New Year's Eve party is murdered in front of all her gursts.  Marlene sets out with Herb Villon to trap a killer, and instead discovers a huge conspiracy that spans the globe.  More murders occur, but the fabulous Dietrich actaully gets her man.  As I mentioned, one reads these books for Baxt's character portrayals.  They are wonderful.  He gives us a real insight into these glorious screen legends.  The mystery and the intrigue are not so exciting.	2003-11-06

In this sparkler the village nurse/midwife is found murdered behind her fortune teller's tent at the flower show.  Who would want to kill harmless, well-liked Nurse Cooper?  Sloan and Crosby are sent to the village to discover the murderer.  It all seems to hinge around a case of verified identity for property that is to be probated.  The hardest thing that he has to determine is motive, but never fear, he manages to figure that out along with the identity of the murderer.	2003-11-04

This is an excellent book and a great addition to the Benjamin January series.  It's probably the darkest of the three in the series that I've read so far.  The atmosphere in this book is so thick you can almost feel it.  We are introduced to the whole world of voodoo as it was practiced in New Orleans during this era before the war between the states.  The locale is exotic, but very, very dark, and we see more twisted human frailties than we have in any of her previous books.  In this book January's sister Olympe is charged with murder for aiding a &quot;high-yellow&quot; woman to kill her husband.  Olympe was supposed to have sold her the poison used to do away with him.  It looks like Olympe is going to hang even though there was no body to be found.  Benjamin sets out to find out what actually happened on the night of St. John's Eve.  As he investigates he brings real danger to himself and his friend Hannibal.  He is thrown into the underworld that the practicers of voodoo magic live in, and he uncovers human depravity like nothing he has ever seen before.  A real smasher!	2003-11-03

Murder occurs at his beloved Priscilla's hotel when a party of people from a dating agency are in residence.  The woman who is murdered is particulary odious.  She's a huge, fat woman with terrible table manners, and it's almost a relief to everyone when she is found dead.  Hamish needs to solve the murder in spite of Blair's incompetence, and he manages to put everything together to do that.  Again, the book is totally carried by Hamish.  What a character he is!	2003-10-30

I wasn't going to begin this new series of Anne Perry's since I love the Pitt and Monk series so much.  I thought that none could compare and it's a different historical time as well.  I read the reviews for this book in Amazon and thought it probably wasn't worth the time.  I am very glad that I didn't ignore this book!  Ms. Perry weaves her web and draws her readers into the golden summer of 1914 in England as only she can.  A much simpler age than now, surely, but underneath the idyllic setting is a very real threat and enormous danger.  It is the dawn of the greatest war the world has ever experienced, and we the readers are right there in it.  The book shows the fear, darkness and terror experienced by the people when an event occurs in faraway Sarajevo that will alter the world as they know it.  English people know that this war will lead to mass destruction and to many thousands of deaths, and they are powerless to stop it.  The book is set around a very small area of rural England (around Cambridge), but even in this sleepy little area the danger of the world creeps in.  Murders occur that bring the terror to the citizens of Cambridge.  We meet a whole new cast of characters that we hope to see in the future.  Awesome!  And the title is just as haunting as every page in this book - &quot;NO GRAVES AS YET&quot;.	2003-10-29

In this book she's on the track of a candy store salesman, and before she bags her man she turns up numerous dead bodies, and almost gets killed herself numerous times.  We also get to see a lot of Ranger in this book, and that's a definite plus.  Ranger is awesome.  He's like a mysterious black panther that slips and in out of dangerous situations.

She makes the era come to life expertly.  In this book we are introduced to a home for &quot;fallen&quot; women - something quite common during this era when the ordinary citizen took responsibility for people in need because there were no social safety nets. In the book it appears that there is a crazed killer out attacking girls from Bertram's Bower (one of the homes as I've mentioned).  The nature of the killing has the public worrying that the Whitechapel murderer, Jack the Ripper, has moved his base of operation to Boston.  Caroline and her brother set out to try to determine who is committing these very bloody crimes because one of Caroline's dear friends runs Bertram's Bower, and it's her girls getting killed.  Along the way we are exposed to the seemier side of Boston in 1892.  The portrait painted of Boston from this time is very authentic, even though the mystery is easy to figure out.  I really enjoy this series.  It's a pleasure to find an author who knows how to create a believable Victorian mystery.	2003-10-24

A lady with life-threatening diabetes is found dead in her home.  That doesn't look so suspicious until it is discovered that this quiet chemistry teacher has 3/4 of a million pounds in her bank account.  This puts Sloan and Crosby on the tail of a murderer.  The book is quite fast-paced for a Catherine Aird, and there is a fair amount of tension throughout.  This is certainly aided by the impending birth of Sloan's baby and the needs that his family situation put on him.  But never fear, he's there for the arrest of the murderer, and he makes it in time for the birth of his son.  A good entry in the Sloan series.	2003-10-22

I read a lot of the reveiws, and I don't agree with quite a few of them.  I thought this book was pretty good, and exciting.  Yes, the plot is a little thinner than previous books, and yes Kay does wear on one after a time, but the forensics are awesome, and the suspense keeps on and on.  I do have to admit that I do tire of Lucy somewhat.  To me the books would be better without that added character.  In this book Kay, Marino and Wesley are on the trail of the infamous Temple Gault (Kay's long time nemesis).  The story is set around the week from Christmas Eve to New Year's Eve, but a lot happens in that short time.  We see Kay, Marino and Wesley panicking as they try to nail down what seems to be the most notorious serial killer in the country at that time. Pretty good stuff!	2003-10-20

This is probably the best in the Sister Frevisse series so far, even though we know who the murderer is from the beginning.  What we discover as we read is a medieval mystery that has a great sense of time and place.  We see the whole &quot;castle keep life&quot; as they lived it.  We also see the superstition and belief in the supernatural that was so much a part of this day and age.  It must have been terrible for anyone that suffered from the &quot;falling sickness&quot; back then since people were so afraid that that person was possessed by demons.	2003-10-19

Part of the problem is that Ms. Myers has to repeat everything with every new installment in the series.  Then the little comments don't seem so funny anymore.  For example we've heard how Magdalena's parents died in every single book, and I'm sure it will be in every other one in the series.  Magdalena has some original funny moments in this book, and that's what keeps me reading.  I will try to persevere with the series, but it's hard slogging.  In this book the Penn Dutch Inn is being used to host a cooking show.  Magdalena's cousin Freni is entering her unbeatable bread pudding into the contest, and things start really cooking when the owner of the company who is sponsoring the contest is found dead in Magdalena's barn.	2003-10-17

It turns out to be real, so Hamish sets out to find a killer.  We see the odious Inspector Blair and more of Priscilla in this book.  I found the plot a little thin, and it's missing a lot of the unique highland flare that shows up in Ms. Beaton's other books, but well worth a read if you're reading the series as I am.	2003-10-14

They do manage to get in some pretty odious situations, as well as dangerous ones.

I am a huge Catherine Aird fan, but I was a bit disappointed with this book.  I found it confusing, and the murderer and motive when they are relieved are &quot;way out there&quot;.  There was no build up or hints to that ending and I found that turned me off a bit.  Sloane is still &quot;tongue-in-cheek&quot;, and Crosby is still a brash young constable;  Dabbe is still macabre (but we don't really see much of him in this story).  This is a story about international intrigue that is played out in a university community.

Priscilla is too busy with her father's hotel, so he accepts an invitation to go to lonely, remote Eileencraig for the holidays.

While he's there another resident at the health farm turns up dead, and Hamish finds himself in the middle of a murder again.

I really like how the main characters are developing - Kay, Marino, Benton and Lucy.

On the way they become exposed to one of the most disfunctional families you'll ever come across.  This liaison could end up costing Falco his whole net worth and then some, because if a court case is brought against someone and they are judged innocent, the advocate is ordered by the court to pay compensation which is determined by the rank of the individual who was accused.  Ms. Davis books keep getting better it seems.  She manages to keep her Falco interesting and fun through each of them.  I haven't enjoyed a series so much since Brother Cadfael.	2003-10-03

As in the other books in this series, this book is really thin in the plot area, and in this one the motive for the killing is not plausible, but it's still a funny story in it's own way.  Readers must be die-hard cozy fans to enjoy this series, and they must be willing to give the author a lot of latitude since Ms. Myers really needs an editor for her books.  This book is about what appears to be a hit-and-run murder, and at first glance it looks like it might be local Amish boys that did it.  That is why Melvin Stoltzfus deputises Magdalena to help him solve the mystery.  I'm really not sure about this series.  Each book seems more disjointed than the last one, and they make less and less sense.  But I do finish the books, even though it seems like an almost guilty pleasure.	2003-09-29

He is the epitome of laconical, and he's a one-man wrecking team.  This book seemed a little slow in the first half, but then the action picks up and is non-stop right up to the end.  In the book Jack gets put into a perilous situation simply because he was in the wrong place at the right time, so to speak.  He gets pulled in because he offered a helping hand to an attractive woman with a bad leg, and right from that moment he knows that he has to protect her from some evil forces that have her in their major plan.  Jack handles the impossible situations with his usual resourcefulness and intelligence.  Before the book is done we, the readers, are introduced to the whole para-military culture that is alive and well among extremist groups.  There is even a meglamaniac thrown in to add to the suspense (and to the graphicness of the book as well).  Jack eventually triumphs over evil, but not before he takes a number of the bad guys down.  I love Jack Reacher.  Child does a masterful job of portraying him, and Child is certainly my choice for the best modern thriller writer out there.	2003-09-25

I do enjoy them, and they are quite humourous, but the writing is not the best.  She quite often slips into the &quot;slapstick&quot; in the books, and I don't really enjoy that either.  If she would stick to the story, and keep introducing interesting characters like CJ (Calamity Jane) in this book, the books would be much better for it.  In this book, our Abigail finds a dead body in a Louis XV armoire that she has just purchased at an estate sale.  As she tries to track down the murderer in order that she'll be able to open up her antique shop again, she uncovers a very disfunctional family with any member with a solid motive for the killing.  Then this is where the book breaks down.  Why does Abigail try to apprehend the killer by herself?  It's always this part of the book (the denouement) where Ms. Myers plotting breaks down, and the book verges on the slapstick.  I'm not sure about Ms. Myers two series - Magdalena Yoder and Den of Antiquity.	2003-09-22

This isn't your typical twelve come to a dinner party murder mystery, but that is where it begins.  Twelve came to dinner at the manor house and after that dinner, the lord of the manor, Bill Fent is killed in a car accident.  That doesn't look like murder, but Sloane finds out from the irrepressible Mr. Dabbe that there were enough barbituates in Bill's body to kill two lords of the manor.  So Sloane and the bumbling Crosby are on the hunt for a murderer. As with all of Ms. Aird's books, if you follow the clues you may be able to figure out who the murderer is, but that in no way takes away from the fun.  There is enough &quot;tongue-in-cheek&quot; in each of her books to keep the reader chuckling all the way through.  And oh what a gem Sloane's boss, Leeyes is!  I really enjoy these English cozies.  Each one is totally unique and enjoyable in it's own right.	2003-09-18

Ms. Beaton is the queen of village mysteries, and each one of her Hamish Macbeth books is as delightful as the last.  In this one, the story starts with Hamish living in Strathbane where he has been tranferred.  He's not a happy man because he has had to move from his beloved Lochdubh.  The villagers of Lochdubh aren't happy either, and they stage a number of &quot;crimes&quot; in their small village which forces the authorities to send Hamish and Towser back where they want to be.  But in true Hamish fashion, murder seems to follow his reinstatement.  One of the villagers is burned inside her car, and it's apparent to Hamish that it was murder.  He opens up a whole wasp's nest of potential murderers, and it's up to Hamish to find the one who did it.  This book is a delight - offbeat and funny.	2003-09-17

This second book in the Duncan Kincaid/Gemma James mystery series, I found more entertaining than the first.  I still would not put Ms. Crombie on the same level anywhere near Elizabeth George or Martha Grimes.  Her characterizations cannot compare with either of these illustrious ladies, as far as I'm concerned.  Also, I just didn't feel the &quot;Englishness&quot; in this book.  It didn't read like an authentic British novel.  In this book Duncan sets out to find out if his terminally ill neighbour was killed or whether she committed suicide.  I must admit that I had the murderer figured out about half way through.  I will still pesevere with this series, but am sadly disappointed.	2003-09-16

I didn't think that I'd find a more likeable detective than Cynthia Harrod-Eagles' Bill Slider, but Peter Diamond is right up there.  He's quirky, funny and just tough enough.  And Lovesey's other characterizations are just as good.  In this book we have a Janpanese Sumo wrestler that engages Diamond to help find a small autistic Japanese girl.  She has been abducted from her group home in unexplainable circumstances.  With any other author, this plot might appear farcical, but in Lovesey's hands it is inventive, warm and endearing.  Of course the character of Peter Diamond makes it that way, but his other characters are wonderfully drawn as well.  Diamond is my new favourite!	2003-09-14

Ms. Hambly borrows from true historical situations to write this story about her &quot;freed coloured&quot; hero, Benjamin January.  This book opens during a massive &quot;fever&quot; (Bronze John) outbreak in New Orleans in the summer.  Benjamin is working nights at a hospital trying to help people stricken with the sickness.  He is a trained doctor, although he is not allowed to practice at any other time because he is &quot;coloured&quot;.  He is asked to pass a message from a runaway slave to her slave lover in another household and from this seemingly innocuous act, he is embroiled into a maelstrom of of lies, greed, torture and murder.  As we read we see life as it was in 1833 New Orleans.  We also see how black people had no choice or rights in that city, even if they were &quot;free&quot; and not slaves.  It's scary to see what can be overlooked and glossed over for cultural or politically reasons.  This is an awesome historical mystery, and much more fast-moving and exciting than the first one was.	2003-09-11

I missed Ranger, Stephanie's fellow bounty hunter in this book.  His character is wonderful, and I hope we see more of him.  This book got a little ridiculous with Granny Mazur.  I understand that there are eccentric senior citizens out there, but I found the doings with Granny took away from the rest of the story.  She seemed somehow fake and overdone.  But Stephanie's just as good as ever, and beautiful Morrelli is there too.  In this book, Stephanie is trying to find Kenny Mancuso - a real live wire from the burg.  As she closes in on her prey she finds that she is the recipient of some very dubious presents from the guy she's trying to bring in.  You'll have to read to find out all the hilarious antics.	2003-09-08

Even the discovery of the corpse is funny.  It turns up in a 20-year old bucket of sauerkraut.  Magdalena is less than amused since the sauerkraut was given to her by her soon to be father-in-law as a gift.

Kay just keeps getting better and better.  It's also fun to see the characters develop more with each book - Kay herself as she seems to be always \\"one against the world\\", Marino who it appears is heading towards some sort of heart attack, Lucy who seems to be getting more and more quixotic.  In this book Kay finds herself smack in the middle of a series of gruesome killings.  It appears that a recently executed murderer, who Kay herself has seen  on her autopsy table, is still around committing crimes.  A number of murders occur where the executed murderer's fingerprints are turning up.  Kay, Marino and Benton try to track a killer, but it appears that the corruption goes up a long ways into the political stratosphere.  This is a taut and totally believable thriller.  I can't wait until the next one because the book ended with the way wide open to the next installment.	2003-09-04

The more that I read Hamish, the more that I like him.  He is a totally understated, shy and smart village policeman.  He has many endearing qualities, not the least of which is his naivety.  In this book an English couple moves into Locdubh and opens up a bed and breakfast.  Their arrival throws the whole village into an uproar because the wife, Trixie Thomas, is a do-gooder as well as a \\"tree-hugger\\".  All the wives join with her and start dramatically changing their home lives, much to the dismay of their husbands.  It doesn't surprise Hamish when Trixie turns up dead and he certainly has no dearth of suspects.  Trixie antagonized a lot of people.  It's up to Hamish to determine who was the one that got mad enough to kill.  Along the way we meet more of our Lochdubh friends and Hamish triumphs again.  Ms. Beaton's characters just seem to live and breathe off the page.	2003-09-02

Her dry wit and intelligent writing make it an excellent example of thie genre.  Not only that, but the book in its entirety takes place during the space of one day.  It can't get much tighter than that.  It all begins when an arm is seen amongst several tons of broken plaster in a locked church bell tower.  This sets Inspector Sloan on the track of a murderer.  But its her characters that make the story so special - the enigmatic Sloane, the bumbling Sergeant Crosby and the colourful Superintendent Leeyes.  Ms Aird is a master craftsman of the the cozy mystery formula.	2003-09-01

I've been reading through Margaret Frazer's series with Sister Frevisse, and I found this book not very exciting and there's not much mystery here.  Normally I enjoy Ms. Frazer's books, but this one was not my favourite.  In this book Sister Frevisse is called to a funeral for her beloved uncle, Thomas Chaucer.  While at the funeral feast one of the nobles that is present gets in an argument and says, &quot;May God stike me dead, if what I say isn't the truth!&quot;  Then sure enough he is overcome with some sort of attack and can't catch his breath.  He later dies from this and Sister Frevisse is asked by a distant relative (who is a bishop) to find out what actually happened.  Of course, it wasn't a sign of God, and she does discover the killer, but so had I.  I figured it out long before the ending of the book.  I will continue to read this series, but I do hope that it gets interesting again.	2003-08-31

Her writing, plot and character development are unsurpassable.  This book is no different.  It's powerful and suspenseful, and a true psychological thriller.  There are a lot of copycats out there, but none can touch Ms. James.  In this book Dalgliesh investigates a gruesome murder at a small private museum.  This museum is dedicated to displays of art, literature, pop culture, etc. in the years in Britain between the two great wars, and one of the displays is a \\"murder room\\" where information is set out about infamous murders that happened during this time in English history.  When the first murder occurs, it looks like a copycat from one of the earlier murders.  Before Dalgliesh and his team can solve the first murder another body turns up which reinforces the copycat theory.  Dalgliesh manages to solve the cases, but not before we see a lot of unexpected complications.  James can magically transcend genres and she accomplishes that brilliantly with this novel.	2003-08-29

I could not believe how much more enjoyable this book was than  the first one (A Mystery of Errors).  I really didn't care for that one because I thoughtit was disjointed and a bit silly.  This book is entirely different!  It's a rollicking good romp in Elizabethan England.  I find Hawke's razor wit very enjoyable.  Will and Tuck are wonderful protaginists and their very differences make them a very effective duo.  Tuck bumbles around in his innocent way and usually ends up precipitating catastrophic acts.  Will sits back and observes and acts as a foil for Tuck.  This book has more ups and downs in it than a roller coaster and the ending will surprise you as it certainly did me.  I also like how Hawke throws in beloved Shakespeare quotations throughout the story.  It's like coming back to an old friend.  In this book Tuck and Will set out to find out who killed &quot;the bride&quot; - the shrew in this instance- on the very day of her wedding.  They uncover conspiratorial plots, love trysts and more murder as they do so.  I really enjoyed this book.  It's the most fun I've had since I read my last Lindsey Davis book.	2003-08-27

Maybe because we did not see Lynley nor Havers in the story at all.  Havers is definitely my favourite character and I missed her in the story.  But a \\"not-so-good\\" Elizabeth George is better than most works of detective fiction by other authors.  I love the way Ms. George writes novels that happen to be detective stories.  In this book an old friend of Deborah St. James turns up in her and Simon's lives in England.  Simon and Deborah travel to the island of Guernsey to go to China and her brother Cherokee's aid.  A local magnate has turned up dead and China is thought to have done the deed.  Deborah can't believe that her old friend would hurt anyone so she comes to her aid.  In the book we find out a lot about Guernsey and a lot about Guernsey in the Second World War and I found that interesting.  But I found Deborah to be a spoiled brat and found that I had a hard time maintaining my liking for her.  And really the mystery is not that much of a mystery, but some of the people that we meet (in true Elizabeth George fashion) are wonderful - Paul, Ruth and Frank for example).	2003-08-26

Ms. Reichs books are wonderful because they are full of forensic information.  Her knowledge of anthropological forensics is extensive and she puts a lot of it in books, but in a way that is interesting for the layman.  I liked this book better than her last one that was set in Guatemala.  In this Tempe is doing her thing in Charlotte.  We also get to see more of Ryan and Tempe's relationship with him does pick up a notch.  The book starts out very strong with Tempe examining the burned bones of a newborn.  From there we go to drug tafficking and the illegal sale of animal parts.  There are a number of seemingly unrelated incidents (and bodies) that clutter up Tempe's table, but it turns out they are all related in one way or another.  That's where I feel the book falls down somewhat because of the incredible coincidences that keep happening, and the ending is rushed and disjointed.  Still it's an excellent read and there's lots of excitement and a little romance too.	2003-08-20

The forensics were probably a little scarcer than usual in a Patricia Cornwell book, but I don't think the book suffered because of that.  I find that I have to know that I'm going to set aside a day to read one of these books because I can't put it down, and want to finish it one sitting.  In this book Dr. Scarpetta is up against a serial killer who is killing young couples.  There's spooks (spies) and politics galore and we find Kay trying to do her job while working around all these outside pressures.  These books are so genuine and so authentic that I am truly hooked.	2003-08-19

I really enjoyed the first book in this series, and the second one was OK, but not as good as the first, but this one was just terrible!  I gave it two stars instead of one because I know that Ms. Myers is capable of much better than this.  This book is poorly written and poorly edited.  There are glaring mistakes in it, and the plot is so loose that you could drive a truck through it.  The last few chapters are truly terrible, and rather than feeling anything for the main characters, I just wanted to finish the book.  I will read one more in this series and if it's as bad as this I will not continue.  I did enjoy the first in her Den of Antiquity series, and will continue with that one unless the same thing happens with that one that has happened here.  It appears that Ms Myers is trying to make a slapstick comedy, and it falls flat.	2003-08-18

Beaton's stories are absolutely excellent and the best examples of cozies you'll find anywhere.  I am almost disappointed with myself because I read her Agatha Raisin series before the Hamish Macbeth series.  As much as I enjoy Agatha, Hamish is pure delight!  In this book he has been transferred to Cnothan to relieve the village policeman as he takes an extended vacation.  Right away Hamish is thrown into the village's political situation.  He finds the people of this village are unfriendly and there seems to be an oppresive atmosphere in the village.  Sure enough, in true Hamish fashion, a corpse shows up.  Hamish must determine first who has been killed and then who actually did it.  Hamish and the reader are subjected to more of the odious Blair as he is again sent to the village to unravel the homicide.  Of course Hamish solves the murder (and not Blair) but not before he actually finds some romance in this ominous little village of Cnothan.  We also discover why Hamish will never eat lobster again.  Hamish  is a wonderful character and I find as I read each story, he becomes more and more real to me.	2003-08-16

Not only does Baxt provide us with a cracking good murder case, but we really get to see what it was like when Hollywood was set on its ear with Talking pictures as opposed to silents.  A lot of people were ruined with this big change, and lots made themselves more famous and more rich, but it was a collosal switch in the way motion pictures were made.  The book is set in Hollywood in 1929.  In true Baxt fashion we meet a lot of real people from this era (Sam Goldwyn, Hedda Hopper, Mary Pickford) as well as some great fictitious characters like Superintendent Villon and the Darling family.  Baxt writes with &quot;tongue in cheek&quot; and his take on the famous Goldwyinisms is hilarious.  This book has many surprises throughout.  I for one did not have the real murderer and the ending shocked me.  Anyway you look at it, reading it was a whole lot of fun.	2003-08-16

I am a great fan of Anne Perry so imagine my delight when I found this author and this book.  The era is the same as Ms. Perry, but the setting is in Boston, not England.  Ms. Peale delineates Victorian Boston very well, and her characterizations are quite good.  The proprieties and social consciousness are the same as Ms. Perry, and the evils are just as vivid.  This book deals with the death of Colonel Mann who we never meet in the story, but we certainly hear enough about him.  He wrote scandal sheets and used information that he gleaned from his many informants to blackmail various people in society.  The kind of character that has many people who are happy at his death, but the murder needs to be solved anyway because Addington's nearest and dearest were affected by everything and in danger.  I look forward to more Beacon Hill mysteries.	2003-08-14

I read all the Cribb/Thackery series awhile ago, and this is my first of Lovesey's series with Peter Diamond.  I'm glad to be reading him again.  He is a veteran novelist.  Although this series is entirely different than Cribb and Thackery, Lovesey's talent as a novelist is very apparant.  His writing is a bit painstaking at first as he sets up the scene for the murder and denouement, but it still keeps your interest.  In this first book in the Diamond series we are introduced to Peter Diamond who is a Detective Superintendent in Bath, England.  A body of a woman is fished out of the lake and when the body is finally identified it is determined that she was a television star.  In trying to unravel the mystery of this death, Diamond finds out that Mrs. Geraldine Jackman was not a particularly nice person.  Diamond finds himself at odds with his partner while trying to determine the murderer, and it ends up costing him is job with the police.  Diamond still doggedly pursues enquiries on his own and is almost killed himself.  Although I had guessed the murderer about halfway through the book, there were enough other surprises that kept coming up to keep my interest.  I am very interested in reading other books in this series.	2003-08-09

Catherine is asked by her Mother Superior to retrieve something that has been found near her home so she leaves the convent to do so.  She gets embroiled in a nasty conspiracy that forces her to use all her wits to keep herself and an interesting scholar that she meets out of trouble.

It's easy to figure out after reading this book that Baxt actually knew Tallulah Bankhead at the time when this story is set. (1952).  She is portrayed by him in all her outrageous glory, &quot;dahling&quot;.  What a character she was! This book is extremely entertaining and I enjoyed it the most of the three I've read so far.  The book is set during the time of the infamous McCarthy hearings.  Careers and lives hung on the decisions made by the HUAC.  It's when friend turned on friend and enemies swore bitter revenge.  Baxt has taken it one step further to revenge murders for those that &quot;squealed&quot; on their freinds in the hearings.  It is very realistic and because we know how many lives were totally wrecked during this dark chapter in American history, it makes the book very realistic.  Tallulah teams with Detective Jacob Singer (who we last saw in the Dorothy Parker Murder Case) to unmask a killer.  The romp that we have while trying to keep up with the erstwhile Tallulah makes this book a lot of fun.	2003-07-29

This may be a promising start to a new series, but I found this book quite simplistic (written at about Grade 4 level,) and the coincidences were a bit too much!  Kinkaid appears to be a lame duck since he seems to yearn romantically about both women his age that he meets during the course of solving the murder.  Also, I knew that it was an American author writing an English procedural (a la Elizabeth George and Martha Grimes who do it so skilfully), but I found that the story did not sound English and the characters did not sound and act like the English do.  It didn't ring true.  I will attempt to read another book in the series to see if it gets better.  I was looking forward to beginning this series after I had read some of the reviews, so I am disappointed.	2003-07-28

This was a very well-written historical mystery.  It starts a little slow, and it's difficult keeping all the names of the characters straight since there are so many and the names are quite French and different than what most are used to.  But the story is extremely well-researched.  It's easy to see that this author is in love with her era and her place of choice (New Orleans in 1833).  This is a lush, haunting novel like New Orleans itself.  The time of the story is Mardi Gras week and Ms. Hambly deftly describes all the decadent pleasures, glittery ballrooms and the very complicated caste system of old New Orleans.  The hero in the book is Benjamin January, a free man of colour who makes his living by playing the piano even though he is a trained surgeon.  January was born in New Orleans and had moved to France at the age of 16 where he studied to be a surgeon.  He made a life for himself there, but his wife dies of a fever, so he heads back home to be with his family.  He gets thrown into a messy murder that happens at one of the dances he is playing at.  There are many twists and turns in the plots, and the finale I'm sure will shock you, as it shocked me.  The book starts slow but builds up momentum the further along the story goes.  It's a stunner!	2003-07-25

I don't know why I waited so long to get into the Stephanie Plum series.  I think maybe it was because I had read in the reviews that she was a bounty hunter, and didn't think that would interest me.  What a mistake that was!  This book is a great read!  I really didn't want to put it down.  Stephanie is so real and funny that she is a joy to meet.  The book is action-packed and certainly keeps the reader's interest right up unitl the stunning conclusion.  Stephanie finds herself doing apprehension work in order to make some money to keep food in her fridge and to pay her rent.  She isn't prepared for the dangers that she faces while she's out to capture her old nemesis, Joe Morelli.  Stephanie finds out that she has to learn to use a gun and to carry nerve spray in order to defend herself from the bad guys that her new job puts her in contact with.  This book is full of surprises, right up to the very end when Stephanie finally gets her man (in more ways than one).  I can't wait to read the others in the series.	2003-07-23

Poor Henrietta Jenkins loses her mother in a hit-and-run accident and then discovers that she's not Henrietta Jenkins at all, and the woman that she knew as her mother could not possibly have been.  So who is she and who were her parents?  The hit-and-run turns out to be murder and DI Slonae is called in to investigate.

In this book Hamish gets drawn into a murder that happens in the house of his ladylove, Priscilla.  Priscilla comes back to Lochdubh from a job in London with a new fiance in tow.  Hamish has to stay on the sidelines and watch his beloved with another man.  He handles even this appalling situation with grace and humour.  But then a  death occurs and Hamish is sure it's murder.  He sets out to find the killer, but before he does another murder happens.  But, never fear, he does solve the murder in the end, and it was a surprise to me.	2003-07-20

Although I didn't find this book as compelling as Postmortem, I still enjoyed the book.  Ms. Cornwell really knows how to build up suspense in a story.  This book is compelling because of the affinity that Kay feels for the first victim.  She feels that she must find the killer, and sure enough she gets drawn into the web that caught the first victim.  There were a couple of things that I really noticed though.  First, there were lots of twists and turns in the plot, and two strands of story.  Unfortunately, the two strands don't seem to relate and the one that is not to do with the murders gets lost in the plot.  Secondly, does Kay ever have a sense of humour?  I certainly haven't seen it yet.  Still, the forensics are great, and the psychological thriller part is good.	2003-07-18

I love Shakespeare, and I thought this would be a light look at him with enough familiarity about the plays that he wrote to make it fun.  It wasn't like that at all.  It's a romantic mystery that is not handled all that well. I found that I really did not like Elizabeth (not the Queen) at all.  She is supposed to play the romantic interest, but she doesn't ring true.  Even Will Shakespeare doesn't seem real in this book.  I found that I liked Smythe who happens to be a purely fictional character, and Sir William is a good characterization.  The mystery itself is hardly a mystery and there are even inconsistencies there.  I don't want to give the story away, but three is too much of a coincidence!  So, not much characterization, plot or mystery when all is said and done.  I will read a second book in this series to see if there are improvements, but if you are looking for Elizabethan intrigue, you cannot go wrong with Patricia Finney.  Her two books on this era are totally excellent!	2003-07-15

The mystery in this book is not very difficult, but the trip that the reader takes to get there is such fun.  In this book, the Penn-Dutch inn is taken over by a Hollywood crew for filming a movie.  Even Magdelena gets involved as an actress in this one.  But before they get much footage shot, a body shows up in the barn.  Magdelena has to set out to find the killer (mostly because she's &quot;suspecto numero uno&quot;, according to the less than brightest light that represents the law in Hernia.)

It is hard to believe that a book that was written so many years ago could still be thrilling and exciting today.  I now understand why Ambler is thought to be the father of the spy novel.  It would be difficult to find a writer today that could build up this kind of suspense and intrigue.  I couldn't help thinking as I was reading it that it would make a great black and white movie, and then I found out that it actually was made into a movie in the 40's.  Peter Lorre and Greenstreet starred in it.  It would be nice to see this old movie now that I've read the book.  The book is set mostly in the Balkans, but Ambler takes the reader to Athens and Paris too.  The story is about a mystery writer's curiosity to trace the life of a criminal that he first sees dead on a slab in Turkey.  Charles Latimer gets pulled into all kinds situations while he pursues the truth.  The story is action-filled right to the end.  This has to be one of the best books from the 30's (at least in this genre).	2003-07-09

I have come a little late to Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series.  (After all this book, the first in the series, was written 13 years ago).  I regret that I have not delved into this series before this, but I'm certainly glad that I have found it now.  This is a gangbuster of a book.  It's so real, that it will keep you frightened well after you read the last page.  Some of the information is a bit dated since it was written so long ago, but that does not hinder the suspense.  For example, the computers in this book are many generations previous to what we have now.  I'm sure that Ms. Cornwell's subsequent books have kept up with the technology changes, and I will certainly be finding that out since I intend to read every one.  In this book we are introduced to Kay Scarpetta, County Medical Examiner in Virginia.  She is on the track of a \\"Mr. Nobody\\" that has been raping and killing young women with increasing rapdity in her city.  While she and the cop in charge of the case are closing in on the killer, she finds out that someone has been sabotaging her office.  Is it the killer, or someone much closer professionally to her?

It's been awhile since I read a book written by Catherine Aird and I'd forgotten how great she is.  Any true lover of mysteries cannot say their reading experiences are complete without at least reading some of Ms. Aird's works of art.  This book is no different.  I was expecting an addition the the Inspector Sloane series, but this book does not include him.  Instead it is about a retired, semi-invalid businessman who had just moved to Easterbrook with his wife.  They had purchased the old manor house.  He soon discovers that the old house has many secrets, not the least of which is a one hundered and fifty year old skeleton in a Priest's hideout (left over from the Elizabethan age when practicing Catholicism was bad for the health).  Thomas Hardy is the businessman and the new owner of the manor house and he sets out to try to solve the old murder.  We are also treated to another story string - a more recent murder of one of the village residents.  Hardy gets inadvertantly involved in solving that one too.  Although this summarizes the storyline it does not do justice to Ms. Aird's incredible craftsmanship and her poetic style of writing.  I am so glad that I've decided to read her again.	2003-07-04

She is a no-nonsence, mean-spirited Pennsylvania Dutch woman who has turned her family farmhouse into a successful country inn.  The hotel guests were interesting as we meet them through the book.  The murders themselves were a bit slow and the mystery was less than breathtaking, but it was still fun to read and I will read more by this author.  There is a lot about food in the book, and you will find yourself hungry as you read it.  Miss Magdalena's acid tongue gets to be a bit much sometime, but nevertheless, the book is worth a read.  In this book Magdelena is faced with two sudden deaths of her hotel guests.  Are they connected?

Macbeth is a poky Scottish village constable who appears to not know how to even tie his shoes, but when he sets his mind on discovering a murderer, he shows that he has a mind like a steel trap.  He has the Miss Marple knack of being able to compare people and situations to those he is familiar with, and he has the added help of many relatives throughout the world that he can call on for information.  In this book Hamish solves the murder of a very nasty woman who has come to the village for a week long fishing school.

A very nasty character indeed, and there is certainly no lack of suspects.  Great fun!	2003-07-02

This is a very good example of a noir detective story.  In it we meet a lot of real people from the Roaring Twenties entertainment crowd.  The mystery is sketched around Rudolph Valentino's death, but we see the real people that lived in and around his circle.  It is clear that Baxt knew some of these people since he writes about them as an old friend might.  He has a witty, breezy style, and he perfectly captures the way of life of Prohibition New York.  The story takes place in the summer of 1926, just a few days afer Valentino's sudden death.  We meet Dorothy Parker and the rest of her Algonquin crew as they join forces with the cops to solve the murder of a dead showgirl.  There is a lot of organized crime in the story, and we get a clear picture of how they operated, the front men that they set up and the way they dealt with traitors.

Agatha keeps getting better and in this book she is truly refreshing.  There is no man in the book that she is trying to impress so she goes it alone quite a bit, and the book is much the better for that.  Here we see an independent Agatha trying to solve the mystery of an almost too-beautiful new curate that has arrived in her village.  As she works to uncover the murderer she discovers that the beautiful young man was certainly not what he seemed.  He had made quite a few enemies in his rather short life, and there is no shortage of suspects.

He is one of my favourite Police Detectives out there right now.  He's smart, funny and has a droll sense of humour, and he's a genuinely nice guy.  But I was disappointed with this book.  It was somewhat disjointed and had a loose plot.  The reader figures out who the bad guy is practically right away and it's a matter of reading to find out how they manage to get him.

Like all of Tey's stories, this book is not a simple murder mystery.  The plot is ingenious.  Even though the reader is partly in the secret from early on in the story, the suspense is developed and maintained until the very end.

A murder and a baby kidnapping  that occur during this time runs closely parallel to all of Judy's guilty mother feelings.  While on the murder case without Judy, Lloyd is finding that his theories are not making sense, and he can't make head or tail of the little puzzles liberally sprinkled througout the investigation.  He feels in his gut that he's arresting the wrong person for the murder, but he has no way of proving who actually did it.  All the available suspects seem to have cast-iron alibies.

On the train that he has taken to go to Scotland to visit friends, a young man is found dead in his room.  It truly looked like misadventure, but something about it disturbed Grant and got him searching a trail that took him to the Hebrides, back to London, and to Marseilles.  And what actually got him going on this impossible search were a few lines of poetry scrawled on a newspaper that the young victim had had with him before he died. Wonderful story!	2003-06-06

Once you realize that the book is a prequel to the other Dolly books, a lot of it starts to make more sense.  In this book we hear a little bit about the accident that killed JJ&quot;s wife and the damage it did to him.  We also meet a very interesting Bird - a makeup artist no less.  Her hair colour changes with the weather in the book, and that is where she gets the name &quot;bird of Paradise&quot;.  Rita is quite a gal!  As she says &quot;wee&quot;, but mighty.  There is a lot of confusinon in the story, and it takes some sharp interpretations to stay ahead of the enigmatic Johnson, and I have to admit that I didn't succeed when it came to the discovery of Rita's origin.  But we visit Madeira, Barbados and St. Lucia and that is wonderful thing.  The book bears the Dunnett trademarks - bright dialogue, exotic settings, cheerful characters (though with more secrets than we can imagine.  A pretty wild ride overall!	2003-06-05

This book is probably the darkest book I've read in this series.  As usual the book is well-written and engaging.  Sister Fidelma is asked to cut short her pilgrimage so that she can return home to Ireland to save her friend Eadulf who has been accused of the rape and murder of a very young novitiate at the abbey in the kingdom of Laigin.  Not only that but she finds out that Eadulf has received a sentence of death for his supposed involvement with this crime.  It becomes a real race against time and we wait with bated breath to see whethe or not she can make it in time to save him.  The question of capital punishment becomes the cornerstone of this book.  The plus and minus issues on this all important topis are all issues that we still deal with today.  Fidelma hurries there as fast as she can with three warriors that her brother has assigned to help keep her safe.  And these warriors are indeed necessary.  When Fidelma arrives she finds a sinister and dark abbey where she finds unspeakable crimes have been committed in the name of lust and of greed.  The characters in this book from Laigin are wondefrully depicted.  They all seem sinister and menacing.  Fidelma's search for the truth becomes desperate and a race against time in a land where she can find no allies.  An excellent book!	2003-06-02

In this outing Falco is commissioned by the vigiles and his friend Petronius to find a killer.  The victim is an owner of a scriptorium and a bank.  He also has an ex-wife and a current very young wife.  It is a particularly gruesome murder, and as Falco investigates he finds that there is no shortage of suspects.  The murder victim had many enemies and people who might have wanted him out of the picture.  This is more of a classic mystery story than some of the others in the series, although we do learn a lot about ancient Roman banking practices as well as their publishing businesses.  The denouement is set up by Falco in a room where he brings in all the principal players.  Rest assired. he does find the killer, and he gets a confession.	2003-05-30

Ms. McGown expertly writes a mystery with more than a few \\"little puzzles\\" and red herrings.  In this one there have been more people going through the murder scene before the body was officially discovered than people in Piccadilly Circus.  Lloyd and Tom Finch must try to wade through all the lies and deceits to get to the heart of the matter, and it turns out that the time line is the way they actually find out who did it.  (At least Judy points it out to them).  Judy is eight months pregnant in this book, and plays a secondary role in the actual investigation, but that doesn't stop her from breaking through all the lies to get to the heart of the matter.  The best thing about a Lloyd and Hill mystery is the ongoing storyline with the principles.  Each outing the reader gets to know them better and better - where they begin to feel like old friends.  I'm actually sorry that I only  have one book left to read in this series.  Hopefully Ms. McGown will write again soon.	2003-05-26

They are half the fun in these stories.  This series should be read in order because the development of the characters is so well laid out from one book to the next.  In this book Bill is trying to find out who raped and murdered a well-known journalist.  Don't forget to read the chapter headings because Ms. Harrod-Eagles is still in fine form with the puns.  Even her titles have hidden meanings which you will discover when you find out who committed the crime this time.  There are lots of red herrings and lots of interference by principles in the crime to help keep the murderer a secret until you near the end.  Very good series!  My only complaint is the way this book leaves the reader hanging at the very end regarding Bill's and Joanna's relationship.  Now that Bill's divorce is final, things should be going smoothly for him and Joanna, but that unfortunately is not the case.  We'll have to read the next one to keep up to date on that relationship.	2003-05-24

Lindsey Davis gets better with each outing.  Her characterization is wonderful, and she peoples her books with lots of eccentric and wonderful people.  If you read the series in order, you will get to know them all, plus be able to understand the undercurrants that run between Falco and the many people that are close to him.  In this book we see Falco on the search for a missing child.  His search exposes him to a very disfunctional family.  No wonder the little girl was missing!  Her grandfather and all her relations are the worst lot you'll ever meet.  The search for the child becomes a race against time, and the last few chapters are &quot;edge-of-your seat&quot;.  All the while the quips and jokes just seem to flow from the pages.  Falco finds himself in a very dangerous and embarrassing position where the lack of wearing a loin cloth under his tunic becomes of paramount importance.  This is a wonderful, fast-moving book.  Through all the turmoil and danger, Falco finds out that he has a number of people that are very loyal to him and this comes as a pleasant surprise to him, since two of his partners were people he didn't like or didn't trust, and the other - his friend Petronious - had been distant of late.

I am not surprised that The Daughter of Time is one of Josephine Tey's most loved and revered books.  This is a mystery book, but it is also a quite absorbing historical tale.  In this book we examine, along with Chief Inspector Alan Grant, the age-old question about Richard III of England.  Was he indeed the monster that we all have assumed he was from history books and from Shakespeare, or was he a very unfortunate political pawn?  Inspector Grant is lying in a hospital bed and in order to reliev his boredom, he embarks on a journey to solve this mystery.  With the help of a young American reserch assistant, they actually determine that the whole story of Richard III's infamy is suspect.  It is truly sad that Ms. Tey's life was cut short so soon after the publication of this book.  She was a truly great novelist, and we are blessed for having her works in our libraries.	2003-05-18

This one is an extremely whimsical story about a very talented trained Nanny.  Oh how we all would love to have a Maggie Bee Nanny looking after our children.  Every time I read a new selection in this series, I can't help thinking how good they would be if done in film.  The stories are fast-moving, funny with lots of suspense.  The characters that are in each book are wonderful.  In this one we encounter Eskimos, anthropologists, a millionaire toy manufacturer, and lots of wonderful children and babies - and of course the inimitable Johnson Johnson.  We also travel all over the place - Winnipeg Canada in the dead of winter, New york and Yugoslavia.  We also see more of Dolly in this series.  For those in the know, Dolly is a 52 foot luxury yacht.  These books are a lot of fun to read, and I will be sorry when I've read my way through them all.	2003-05-16

We are treated to a whole potpouri of personalities in this book - psycopaths, bikers, drugs and anything else you can imagine.  Agatha is finally married to her heart's desire James Lacey, but things are not going well.  And then James disappears and all that is left is blood in his cottage and everything smashed!  Before Agatha can take that in, she finds that the police think she's responsible for his disappearance since her and James had  had a huge fight in front of everyone in the Red Lion before James disappeared.  Then a woman is found dead in her home, and the police think James is responsible for that.  Determined to clear her name and James', Agatha sets out to find the real killer.  And oh what her and Charles find when they start searching into the murder victim's lurid past!  This is a wonderful story, and a true depiction of what a cozy should be like.	2003-05-13

I love Jill McGown's books and I'm a real fan of Lloyd and Hill, but this book is a bit too much.  I really enjoyed the first half of the book, but it just got a bit too complicated with the plots and counterplots, blind and double-blind.  This did take away from the story somewhat.  In this book we have a lot of murders and it's up to Lloyd and Hill to try to connect them all and to determine motive and opportunity for each of them.  At first a couple are found dead in their vehicle in their garage, apparently from suicide, but there are a number of \\"little Puzzles\\" about the deaths.  Why are their groceries put away in the wrong cupboards, for example?  Then there is another body - this time a very rich matriarch, found shot in her home.  Lloyd and Hill, in their quest to find the killer encounter a truly disfunctional family and enough hate and animosity to sataisfy anyone looking for motive, but all is not as it seems.  It just takes a little too long for the reader to get to the solution this time.	2003-05-12

She is without the faithful Eadulf, and , in fact, she has deliberately made this trip in order to try to assess her feelings for Eadulf and to asses the validity of her religious calling.  In order to get to Iberia she must take ship.  She books with a group of pilgrims that are going to visit the same shrine that she is going to, but what an ill-assorted group they are.  There are a lot of tensions in the group, and it's not long after they get out to sea before murder occurs.  We meet a lot of wonderful characters in this book, and the sea theme is good.  Fidelma does manage to figure out the murderer, but not before other bodies turn up.  In fact, she narrowly misses being one of them herself.	2003-05-06

Ms Harrod-Eagles' series on Bill Slider continues to delight.  Her writing is wickedly humorous and her characters \\"breathe\\".  This is an excellent edition to the series.  We see Bill Slider at his best in this one.  He is the most likeable detective out there right now, I think.  In this book a woman is found dead in a construction hole at the Old Rectory.  How did she get there?  Was she even murdered?  Bill and Jim Atherton set out to track the killer.  It appears like a straightforward case at first since they discover her husband was terribly jealous, and he really had no alibi for the time of the murder, but as they delve deeper, they find a woman who has been leading a rather unsavoury life, and has been upsetting and making people angry for some time.  As always, Ms. Harrod-Eagles characterizations are great.  Cheif Inspector Porson is an absolute gem.  I caught myself chuckling more than once at his Porsonisms.  Read this series if you like intelligent writing with a diamond hard wit laced right through the whole story.	2003-05-03

As you read the book you will learn all about the magic art such as illusionists, sleight-of-hand, tipping the gaff and a whole potpourri of magic terminology. Not only that you will actually learn how some tricks are done. In this book Amelia and Rhyme are after a very slippery character indeed. They find out that nothing is as it seems with him (other than the dead bodies that he leaves in his wake). It's like trying to catch an illusion or smoke in mirrors.

As usual she gets caught up in village life and sooner or later we know that there will be a murder for her to solve.  This book has the \\"manor-lord\\" murdered in his home (why is Agatha's book that she's writing called \\"Murder at the Manor\\"?)  Her and Sir Charles set out to unlock the mystery, and discover more shenanigans in this pokey little town than they ever expected to.

Ms. McGown is an incredible writer!  Her books are complex and wickedly intelligent.  Her characters get better too.  Rachel Bailey is totally wonderful!  And pay attention to her titles.  They always mean something integral to the story.  In this book we have a murder victim that no one wants to see revenged.  Bernard Bailey was a monster - to his daughter, his wife and everyone that he dealth with.  Who really cares who killed him?  Well Lloyd and Hill need to find out and they have more clues and suspects than they know what to do with.  Can they put them all together, separate the wheat from the chaff?  And if they can, can they then provide the correct evidence to send the killer to prison?  Do they want to send the murderer to prison even?  Bailey was a grade A cad, and the world will be a better place without him in it.  Read this awesome book.	2003-04-26

I prefer the longer mystery novels where there is time to develop characters and to embellish plots, but these 15 short stories of Sister Fidelma are well worth the effort.  Yes, there is a lot of repetition by way of introduction for each story, but they are intended to be stand-alone stories and not every reader may see all the stories or have read the Sister Fidelma novels.  But the stories were interesting because they were set up in the order of creation, and we see Fidelma developing as she goes along.  There is such an array of settings, crimes and motives for each story that it keeps the interest of the reader.  The descriptions of the countryside in the various seasons were what I enjoyed the most.  The last story in the book has the best description of a snow storm that I've read.  If you're a Sister Fidelma fan, you really should take the time to read these stories.  You will not be disappointed.	2003-04-23

This book is certainly the most graphic of all the books I've read in this series.  We see the life of the gladiators and the sport in the ring right from the &quot;front row seats&quot;.  This story tells about Falco's work for the emporer in the census.  He has partnered up with an old enemy of his -Anacrites.  We get to know Anacrites quite well, and he is an appealing character.  While Falco and his partner are doing the census work a lion of one of the men that they are auditing gets killed.  This sets Falco out to disover the netherworld of the animal owners, and he and Helena end up making a trip to Africa while pursuing the mystery.  The final pages in the book are &quot;edge of your seat&quot; type pages, and this is where things get really bloody.

The mystery was very good and kept me guessing until the end.  In fact, I had picked another murderer and plotter entirely.  Also, Fidelmaa is much more likeable in this series.  My main complaint so far was that I really did not like her.  She was too haughty and full of herself with an acid tongue.  In this book, that seems to change.  We meet a much more vulnerable Fidelma, but one who is still as smart as a tack.  She finds her way through the morass and one or two red herrings to discover the murderer and to thrwart a very dangerous plot against her brother's kingship.  She sets out to find out who arranged an assisination of her brother and a rival king who is supposedly trying to make peace with her brother's kingdom, and discovers a missing monk from a neighbouring abbey, an illegal mining operation and a very dangerous political plot.

This second book in the Justin de Quincy series, I think was actually better than the first.  I do hope that she writes more in this particular series.  The characters in this book are wonderful as always, and her craftsmanship ensures that the reader is placed right into the era and the plot.  In this book Justin is asked by his friend Nell to find the killer of a young Welsh girl who was found dead in a church graveyard.  Justin sets out to find this killer while at the same time he is asked to undertake a very dangerous mission for his queen, Eleanor of Aquitaine.  He doesn't have to look far for suspects in his murder case as it appears that there were only two - two brothers from the same family.  Justin tries to prove their innocence, and instead uncovers a situation and a homelife that mirrors ones that he is familiar with - his own and his queen's.	2003-04-11

(Yes they must have had them even then).  Falco is back in Rome with his wife and baby daughter and in urgent need of employment as usual.  But he sort of falls into this particular case. He and his friend Petronius are sitting by a non-working fountain taking some much-needed R and R when they discover a severed human hand.  This sets them both on a quest to catch a serial killer that it appears has been abducting and killing women for a long time.  Like all of Ms. Davis' books this book is great fun.  We get to renew our acquaintance with old friends and meet some new ones as well.  I can hardly wait for the next episode.	2003-04-02

This is a great seventies thriller, and I think would make a great movie (a la James Bond style).  The part in the book about the yacht outrunning a homing bomb on a power boat is worth reading the book for alone, but the rest of the book is great too.  The \\"doctor bird\\" in this book is one of Ms. Dunnett's best characters.  She might appear a bit anachrinistic but this book was written in 1970 after all.  B. Douglas MacRannoch is a treasure - a tough, no-nonsence girl who thought up to this time in her life, that she could manage on her own.  She meets Johnson and is swept unwittingly into an espionage game that really takes her by surprise.  We meet all sorts of eccentric characters - the Begum, Dr. MacRannoch's father, and a Turkish ballet dancer of all things.  It's a great romp of a book, and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end and you find out that nothing is as it seems.	2003-03-29

McGown keeps on getting better and better with each new installment in the Lloyd/Judy series.  Her character development for her key characters is very good (along the lines of Elizabeth George).  She does a really good job with the new characters in each story too.  This book keeps you guessing until the very end, and like all good British procedurals, has two or three story strands that come together at the end.  In this case there is a freed rapist that got out of jail on a technacality and we know it won't be long before he rapes again.  There is a very likeable pimp that appears to be doing some double-dealings, a murder and there is a string of burglaries.  We have more suspects for the rapes and burglaries than we know what to do with - and lo and behold - one of the suspects (for the murder) is Judy herself. Judy and Lloyd's relationship advances to another level in this book, and it's probably about time too.  Also, they get a new boss who appears to be caught in a sexist timewarp.  Very good stuff!	2003-03-26

This book is quite different than most of the others in the series.  Even the theme is different because the book is written around the whole concept of natuaral dyeing.  Plants are still a part of the story, but in a different way.  In this book China and Ruby set out to save a small Texas town from dying.  The local landowner wants to sell the mining rites to the land, and it didn't seem to matter to him that the land had people's houses and businesses on it.  Needless to say, he was not a popular citizen and when he turns up dead, no one in the small town of Indigo seems to mind a bit, but then other things start heating up and another body is found that seems totally unrelated to the first murder, and China and Ruby, along with China's McQuaid are on the tail of a murderer.  Not a bad little story.	2003-03-22

This installment in the Agatha Raisin series is quite enjoyable.  Agatha has decided to holiday (off-season) in a seaside town while her hair grows out.  She ends up meeting some truly eccentric octogenarians, and of course murder occurs.  This time it is the village \\"witch\\", and it turns out that she had quite a few enemies.  In her blundering way, Agatha sets out to solve the murder and becomes involved with the village police inspector.  He's a treat, but true to form, Agatha can't let things take their natural course and precipitates a breakup.  Anyway, the mystery is solved, and Agatha has to go back to her life in Carsley (with a new cat in tow).	2003-03-20

This book was not my favourite Graham, but a good one nevertheless.  Ms. Graham's characterizations make her stories exceptional and this book is no different.  This book starts with the death of an unpleasant man, and we the readers really don't care who did it, but Ms. Graham develops the other members of the village, and we suddenly find ourselves caring very much about some of the chief characters. This book is also different in that there is no real doubt as to the killer - the only thing is to try to flesh out the details as to why that particular killer killed that man and harmed that woman.  This makes it a bit different than many other of her books.  I certainly hope that this not her last effort in the Barnaby/Troy series.  This book was written in 1999 and there has been nothing since then.	2003-03-18

Her books are very carefully plotted and her character development is excellent.  In this book we get to see Judy in action.  Her careful attentiveness to detail, and her detailed notetaking help her solve this perplexing murder of a schoolgirl.  Typical of Ms. McGown there are plenty of twists and we dont' discover the real murder until the very end.  In the meantime we the readers have thought it was three or four different people as the plot unfolds.  The title of the book is a pun on something quite relevant to the case.  Read it and discover Ms McGown's wonderful world in the English midlands.	2003-03-14

Why does he not believe the fifteen year old gir in her story that she was held captive in an attic by two women.  Robert finds himself on the side of the accused women and he has to use all his deductive powers and trust to prayrer and good luck to solve the case.  Miss Tey writes an awesome story!	2003-03-11

She's written 25 and each one is still fresh and new. Starting a Braun book is like a hot cup of tea, a cozy quilt and a warm fire all in one. I get this incredible feeling of wellbeing when I begin a new story. This book is very good. It's different than a lot because there is no real murder until near the end of the book, but there are plenty of nefarious characters, and things that make Qwill's mustache tingle! KoKo is his usual astute self, and picks out the bad guys right away - even if he has never seen them. He gives all kinds of clues of the double-dealing that is going on for those that are wise enough to listen to them. I sure do hope that Ms. Braun continues to write these wonderful cozy mysteries that we all enjoy.	2003-03-08

This book starts out in Ancient Rome where Falco gets involved with the murder of another informer and the almost fatal injury of, all people, Anacrites - the chief of the spies who actually set him up to be killed in the last book.  Faclo is commissioned to try to find out the killer and to stop some price-fixing plans that are being contemplated on olive oil - a very profitable product even in ancient Rome.  His commission takes him to Roman Spain (or Corduba).  The story is great fun and gives the reader a good understanding of ancient Spain and the Olive Oil industry.  Falco brings his very pregnant cohort Helena with him on his journey.  What would a Falco story be like without the beauteous Helena?	2003-03-07

Johnson is here in all his glory, and this time the Bird is a real smart cookie - one who likes to cook believe it or not.  This book has everything - sex, stolen jewels, spys, murder and lots of action.  Sarah is the bird in this story, and she's a really likeable dame.  Her mother and dead father provide the quirkiness.  Her brother is the plodder, and her friends show the fast life that money pays for in the beautiful Spanish town of Ibiza.  Sarah finds she is involved with three young men and is in the enviable position of having to choose, but unfortunately the choices are really made for her in a well-orchestrated  denouement engineered by the enigmatic Johnson.

Seven Dials is one of the best books in the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series! It has everything in it, and although there are a few coincidences in it, it still is wonderful entertainment. The plot of this story takes place in Victorian England and in Egypt. Both places are beautifully described and the reader really feels that they are there in this time and place. Pitt is trying to fit into his new position in Special Branch, and he's trying to figure out his superior - Victor Narraway. Neither one trusts the other as yet, but by the end of the book, they trust each other implicitly. They are both working to avert a terrible scandal that threatens the British access to Egyptian cotton and the Suez canal. How a death of an ex-soldier in a moonlit garden can threaten the well being of a nation is up to the reader to find out as they read this wonderful story.	2003-03-02

In this book there are actually three plot strands (one of which is a murder).  In true \\"Golden Age\\" fashion we don't get the answer to any of the three until the end when the murderer is unmasked.  Even though she uses the formula, it is apparent in this book anyway that she likes to flout the rules.  It's that hint of the unexpected that makes her books such a treasure.  And her titles!! They say so much in so few words.<br />In this book Inspector Grant is looking into the drowning death of a famous film star.  There are no shortage of suspects, and there is so much extraneous information that he gets quite frustrated trying to unravel it.  But he peseveres and discovers the murderer in the end.	2003-02-27

Agatha gets involved with a handsome hairdresser from a neighbouring village in this story.  Then she finds out that he is not as he seems.  She pieces together that he has been blackmailing middle-aged women.  Agatha tries to prove the blackmail, but in the meantime Mr. John is poisoned.  Agatha and Charles set out to find the killer.  Agatha is really very appealing in this story.  Her vulnerability is charming to me, as she tries to hide it in her usual bluster.	2003-02-25

Her mysteries are excellent.  This particular one is extremely complex.  There are two storylines that run side-by-side - one from 13 years ago and one for the present of the book.  The same people are involved in both, and the reader has to read and understand both before they can grasp the mystery.  This books pits Lloyd and Judy against a true criminal mastermind.  There are many twists to the plot, but the main one is that the criminal gets murdered.  They find themselves in the unenviable situation of having to solve that murder and an old unsolved one from 13 years before.  But never fear, Judy and her trusty notebook come into play and they do end up discovering the killer in both murders.  Another twist is that who really cares why the criminal was killed.  We find out that he was a truly evil person!  Great reading!	2003-02-24

This is a good Agatha Raisin story.  I found myself enjoying it immensely.  Of course it helped that James Lacey was not in it as much as he is in some of the other stories.  I don't like him and I wish Agatha would forget him and get on with her own life.  Agatha's a mix of city sophisitication and small town vulnerability and that is what makes her so appealing.<br />In this book Agatha is working freelance on public relations for a new spring water company in a neighbouring village.  The commercialization of the spring has opened up a Pandora's box of bad feelings in the village and results in two murders (in true Agatha fashion).  In this one though we see a mosltly solo Agatha working on solving the mystery.  At the very end she is joined by her village friends to unmask the killer.	2003-02-15

I have done quite a bit of reading about ancient Ireland, and this book is certainly not the best I've read about this time.  The writing has promise - Ms. Holland's prose is quite complex, even though the book is short.  But if you've read any of Patricia's Finney's books about an Irish Harper, this book doesn't even come close to the research and attention to detail that it should.  I found that half the book was character development and then we were rushed into a war in a very few pages.  Needs more description in order for the reader to get to know the characters.	2003-02-12

In this installment a gruesome murder of a music critic occurs in a television station bathroom, and Slider is on the trail of what turns out to be a religious zealot. Even though I had figured out the murderer about 1/2 way through, it did not take away from the story. There were still wonderful characters to meet and a spine-tingling ending to get to.

I feel a responsiblity to write a bit more in this reveiw because no one else has reveiewed this book on Amazon, and I would like to get people interested in Jill McGown's books.  This particular book is the seven or eight in the series and I think a very good example of Ms. McGown's writing style.  As I've been reading I've been watching Lloyd and Judy's relationship go through various stages of development.  In this one, Judy has been asked by her superiors to move to her own district so she has recently moved out of Lloyd's flat.  They are still together, but the separation has caused some difficulty in their relationship.  This book has two storylines running concurrently.  A serial rapist in Judy's district and a murder on an English football field in Lloyd's.  The two cases may be connected, and Lloyd has seconded Judy to help him solve his murder.  Together they uncover all kinds of webs of deceipt, fraud, extra-marital affairs, and unexplained traffic infractions.  Give this book a try, I think you'll enjoy it.	2003-01-28

The mystery in this book is very easy to figure out, but the storyline is still entertaining. The scene of the novel is also wonderful. Dartmoor is where Conan Doyle situated his famous Hound of the Baskerville story. This almost mythical spot in England is one I would love to visit one day. What I didn't enjoy about this book and why I gave it only 3 stars, is the short shrift the authors gave to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. There are a lot of people, including me, who hold this man's detective fiction in almost mythical esteem. The Alberts seemed to portray him as a blundering buffoon when it came to solving this \\"real\\" crime.<br />This story is set around the Dartmoor Prison that was in this country in the early 1900's. It focuses around a prison escape, and when a local lord is found dead, it is automatically assumed by everyone except Charles that the escaped prisoner murdered the man. Katherine and Charles dig deeper and find a number of skeletons in the family closet, and then, when these are brought to the light of day, the murder is solved.	2003-01-14

This was the introductory book for Johnson Johnson, and it's easy to tell as he's not as finely developed as he gets in future installments.  The novel is still fast-paced, and funny in its own way.  The singing bird of the title is Tina Rossi, a world famous coloratura soprano.  The story is built around her illicit relationship with an English scientist.

Kinsey is very likeable in this book.  She is much softer and more friendly.  Heavens, we see her friends with her nemesis Dolan in this book, and it seems to work.  There may not have been as much as non-stop excitement in this book as we've seen in others, but let's be fair - it's good to give Kinsey a little rest from bad people and life threats.  Besides, she is working on solving a twenty year old crime, so how dangerous could that be?  It was also good to get a good glimpse of small town America, the setting for this book.

She is famous in the mystery world, and you need to read her in order to determine how we got to where we did with mystery writing.  I enjoyed the story.  She certainly puts enough twists and turns in her plots.  The book is somewhat dated (it was written in 1929) after all, but she has a lot of talent.  I liked Inspector Grant even though he really didn't solve this puzzler, but it was fun following him around in his quest for the killer.  This is a rather unique format for a &quot;locked room&quot; mystery since the victim was stabbed outside in a theatre queue, but it appeared that no one had the opportunity to do the deed.  I want to continue to read the rest of her books.  She writes fairly complex stories.	2003-01-02

I found the story strangely disjointed, and the storyline didn't flow smoothly to me.  The premise is a good one.  Sister Fidelma and Brother Eadulf are summoned to a neighbouring shire to discover who killed the chief.  It was thought that a poor deaf, dumb and blind young man did it since he was found in the bedchamber with the knife that killed the Chief, and covered in his blood.  But Sister Fidelma dug deeper and found a family so filled with hatred, deceit and lies that it was quite frightening!  She peserveres and uncovers the killer, but not before four more bodies turn up dead.  And Brother Eadulf was his usual dolty self.  Don't really know why we have him in these stories - a romantic interest for Sister Fidelma?	2003-01-02

It was a strong entry into the series about Agatha.  In this one she is trying to tie the knot with her handsome neighbour, James Lacey, and lo and behold her husband that she thought was dead turns up.  The marriage is put off, and then her husband is found dead.  Unfortunately, Agatha is a prime suspect in this murder, so her and James need to set out to find out who actually did it.  They get into their usual scrapes, and the reader has a good time following them.  Can't wait for the next one now.	2002-12-30

Quick, those of you who like English Procedural mysteries.  You will not be sorry if you take up this series.  I love Bill Slider.  He is really appealing and a good detective too.  In this book Slider is trying to adjust to life without his wife and two children, and also without his lady love Joanna.  He isn't handling single life that well, but a murder occurs that takes his mind off his personal problems.  The victim in this story was very unlikeable, but it happens that he is the conductor for Joanna's orchestra, so at least Bill gets to see her in connection with the case.  Before the murderer is discovered, Bill Slider finds a whole closet full of secrets in the victim's closet.  Ms Harrod-Eagles keeps you guessing until the end with this one.  Another good installment in the series.	2002-12-30

Ms. McGown writes a good story, and her murder plots are always good.  I really like Lloyd and Judy, and in this one they get to work together on a case that covers each one of their districts.  Two separate murders, and was it one killer?  You'll have to read to find out.  The two separate murders were committed in the victim's homes, but it is found that there is an open telephone line between the two dwellings when the victims are found!  Now that's a different twist!  Lloyd and Judy have to delve deep to find out who committed these crimes, and the trip the reader takes with them is fun, and the there are more twists than you know what to do with.	2002-12-30

I am a big fan of Caroline Graham, and I love her characters - Barnaby and Troy. This book has a pretty good puzzle. Some of the characters were quite well drawn, but I found the book faintly depressing. I wonder if the whole side bar with Brian was really necessary to the story? I found that part of the book quite distasteful actually. There comes a time when storylines like that one can be thought of as sensationalizing since they do not really add to the story. But other than that I enjoyed this book. The dust jacket says that Caroline Graham shows humour and pathos in her stories, and I think that is really true. Barnaby is a really appealing main character, and I want to continue to read in order to get to know him better.	2002-12-23

I didn't think that this was a bad book at all.  On the contrary, I think it was a good reintroduction to this world of Ms. Auel's.  The only negative comment that I have is that there was a lot of repetition about previous books in the series, but I think that can be attributed to the fact that it's been twelve years since the Plains of Passage was published.  Ms. Auel, I'm sure, felt that she had to bring everyone up to date since it had been so long.  I found the book a wonderful representation of what life would have been like for these people in a normal year(without wars, trials and tribulations).  Plus we got a real good picture of the way things were made and just what these people had to do to survive in what could be considered a cruel and hostile environment.  I also found that at the end of the book, there is a lot of ground work laid for what is supposed to be the last book in the series.  Now Ayla and Jondalar are mated, they have a new daughter and Whinney has a new foal.  Bring on the rest of the saga.  Thanks Ms. Auel for wonderful escapism.	2002-12-18

It's sharp and witty like all Didius Falco books, but in this one we see a more vulnerable Falco as he tries to get rid of a lot of preconceived notions about his father.  Geminus Falco is a wonderful character, and I certainly hope we see more of him in upcoming books.  In this book Falco and his father are working together to try to clear his late brother's name and some very outstanding debts.  Falco gets in a lot of scrapes as usual, but this is more of a caper book than the others I've read so far.  It's great fun, and hard to put down.	2002-12-04

This is enough to get Agatha going over the deep end and she imagines all kinds of scenarios with her and James.  It turns out they do catch the killer in the end, and they go back to their own village.  The story doesn't end there though, and Ms. Beaton keeps you hanging at the end of the book for the next installment.	2002-11-29

Her characterization and plot development are wonderful.  This book is a sequel to Firedrake's Eye, which I read a few months ago.  This book is more of Elizabethan cloak and dagger like Firedrake's Eye, but it's not so much espionage as a &quot;hunt&quot; book with many nefarious characters trying to stop our heroes - Beckett and Ames from finding the book they're looking for.  We see Beckett and Ames four years after Firedrake's Eye and they have not lost their appeal.  The narrator in this instance is quite unique - the Virgin Mary, and that helps put a female perspective on things.  My only wish is that Ms. Finney would write more books about these two characters	2002-11-28

I didnt' think this book was as bad as some of the other review stated, but it isn't Martha Grimes' strongest effort.  I still enjoyed the story.  The story was a little different since there was really no crime to solve at first, and when a murder did happen it wasn't integral to the story.  Then somewhere about 2/3 of the way through the book, stuff starts happening, but again there is no real mystery, as there is no intended murder.  Anyway, the book is still good because Ms. Grimes is such an accomplished author.  I would have liked to see more hilarious antics of Melrose Plant and his eccentric Long Piddleton crew, but maybe next time.	2002-11-25

In the first place, her books are quite long and she takes the time to develop a real storyline along with her mystery.  In the second place, she writes of real historical happenings - in this case a summer uprising that occurred near Cambridge about 7 years after the Black Death.  So not only do you get a good story with a good plot, a good mystery that keeps you guessing to the last minute, you get a little education too.  This book was exceptionally good, I thought.  And the denouement at the end shocked me completely.  I usually guess who the murderer is in a lot of mysteries, but I did not guess the whys and wherefores of this particular mystery.  Also, be warned that Ms. Gregory seems to turn up a lot of dead bodies in one of her stories.  In this case, some eight or nine.  I won't say anymore because I don't want to give the story away.  That would be a shame because this one is such fun.	2002-11-18

I have been faithfully reading the Matthew Bartholomew series since Book 1.  I certainly recommend reading this series in order.

A new master has just taken over the college, and he's very much \\"out with the old and with the new\\".  Matthew and all his friends are all afraid that perhaps they won't have their jobs either.  But, never fear, there is more murder in Cambridge and Matthew and his wonderful friend Brother Michael set out to solve the murders.

I am a huge fun of Anne Perry and especially William and Hester Monk.  What makes this book so special, is that Monk finally breaks the barrier to his amnesia, and remembers his past life.  Another reason why this was a page turner for me is that I'm a huge railway fan, and this book is so full of rich detail about 19th century building of railroads in Britain.  I have done numerous papers on railways, and Ms. Perry's facts are very well researched, but the reader also gets a glimpse of what the common people had to sacrifice for the good of the Iron Horse.  Progress then was opposed as it is so often now because of the loss to the environment, people, floral or fauna.  This is a great book, and I can only caution that new readers to William and Hester Monk should not start with this book.  I think all of the preceeding novels must be read before this one can be fully appreciated.  Thank you Ms. Perry for a wonderul series.	2002-11-11

It is extremely well-written and it's hard to believe it's only some 350 pages or so.  The author delves into so much detail into the lives of Robbie, Cee and Bryony.  But, having said that, I read a book to be entertained.  I don't read a book to make me feel depressed, and that is how I felt at the end of the book.  This book is a tragedy - pure and simple.  It is a very well-done, and well-thought out tragedy, but a tragedy just the same.  I found I had to open one of my old standby's to get me in a better frame of mind after I finished the book.  That's why I didn't give the book 5 stars.  For writing, plot, characterization, it probably deserves 5 stars, but it left me too sad to give it 5.	2002-11-07

Although they are all good, I like Ms. Harrod-Eagles series the best.  She is a wonderful writer.  Her plots and characterization are tight, and the story usually has many surprises.  Bill Slider is a wonderful character.  He's sensitive, a bit tentative (especially in his personal life), and a darn good detective.  This was an interesting book because the mystery looked quite simple at the beginning, but the further that Bill dug into it, the more sinister it became.  It took him all the way up to the top with his suspicions.  With the help of his partner, he manages to discover the truth.  I highly recommend this series.	2002-11-01

I am usually very good at figuring out the mystery before the story is done, and I thought I had done it again with this book, but there are surprises in store.  The title was a little confusing at first, but they mystery is a good one. In this book set in an English boarding school, the deputy headmaster's wife is murdered.  The list of suspects is long because Mrs. Hamlyn had been &quot;involved&quot; with many.  In most cases things aren't what they seem, but in this one they are exactly what they seem, but there are so many suspects that it takes Lloyd and Judy Hill awhile to untangle the tangled web.  Ms. McGown is a master at the &quot;sleight of hand&quot; mystery, and she wields a deft touch here.	2002-10-26

I like the way the Albert's craft a tale.  The story is neatly plotted, the mystery is just quirky enough, and we get a bird's eye view of actual people that lived during this era.  The depiction of Lily Langtree is realistic.  We see her as she was in the later stages of her illustrious career.  I found this book was also interesting because of the descriptions of the life of the &quot;horsey&quot; set from this time.  It also told us what horse racing was like in England in the latter part of the 19 century.  Really, not much different than now if you think of it.  Doping still occurs, and fortunes are made and lost at the track.  All in all, a good story with all of our favourite characters.	2002-10-23

I don't really know what I expected, but the book was not really what I expected to read.  I am a firm fan of Ms. Dunnett and thoroughly enjoyed both of her series (Lymond and Niccolo).  This book does not come close.  The premise is a good one - the time travel back to 17th century Scotland, but there is really not much history here.  Characters talk like they do nowadays with a slight Scottish burr.  Don't be deceived - this is a \\"bodice-ripper\\" book, but the difference is that the woman does the ripping.  Claire is a very strong-minded woman, and I'm sure would have been looked at askance and ostracized if she did happen to pop out of nowhere in these times.  There are elements of exciting storytelling here, since I did read to the end but the adventure is really tame.  The sense of time and place is really lacking with this author.  This book seemed as long to me while I was reading it as it actually is.  Because of this I didn't find the escapism that I was expecting.  I may be a little harsh since I'm not usually a fan of this genre.  I love historical novels, but my taste leads to more realistic ones like Michener and Uris.  Romance in long skirts and pantaloons is still romance.	2002-10-19

I don't really know what some of the reviews mean when they say that this book is a bit heavy going unless you're a scholar of this Celtic era.  I didn't find that at all.  I quite enjoy this series, and find that each book tells me more about the people and the history from these times. But it doesn't feel like a history lesson since the mystery is always good.  Sister Fidelma is quite refreshing - an opinionated, and intelligent woman from the seventh century in Ireland.  Not what I expected from this time in history, but it's interesting to find out that women were considered equals and allowed to excel in their chosen fields as far back as that.  Is that the Dark Ages?  It doesn't really seem like it and they were certainly more enlightened than people were in subsequent centuries.  This particular story was a heart-rending one since we also saw how cruel and unmindful of human life some of the warriors were then.  It was particularly sad because children were involved.  The title for this book is certainly appropriate.  But, it was a good story, and I look forward to the next one.	2002-10-11

The wild ride through old Germany and the adventures that befall Falco's ragtag bunch of recruits is fun.  The more I read of Falco, the more likeable he becomes.  And the characters we are introduced to in each book make quite an impresion.  In this case an effeminate barber called Xanthus, and the lovely Helena's younger brother.  Her characters seem alive, and it makes for a fun quick read.  If you are interested in getting an idea of what Germany was like in 71AD, you could do worse than read this book.

I really do enjoy her Richard Jury series, but these two books are wonderful in their own right.  If you decide to embark on the journey, you should read Hotel Paradise first since a lot is not explained in this book.  This is a wonderful coming of age tale starring a very curious and intelligent 12 year old girl.  And before you think \\"Oh children's story\\", it's not anything at all like that.  There is much to learn about human nature in these two books, and Emma's friends and acquaintenaces are absolutely wonderful.  And Ms. Grimes' sense of place is so realistic that you are right there with Emma in this pokey little New England town.  The Rainbow Diner, BrokeDown house, Slaw's Garage, and Windy Run Diner seem as real as any places that are in your own life.  And to steal a sentence from Emma \\"My life had become crowded with people\\" - can be what you are thinking when you read this story.  Lovely book.	2002-10-05

She does a tremendous amount of research for each one and it really shows.  In this particular case, the book transports the reader back to the reign of Elizabeth I.  She paints the picture of life in England at this time so realistically.  We see the squalor and the corruption.  We fully realize that, as Ms. Finney states in her introduction, that the Elizabethan people were not very nice people.  Ms. Finney's love of history shows in her writing, and this book is no exception.  She sees things and tells things like they were, with no frosting or frills.  This book is about a terrorist plot to kill the queen, and all the intrigue and ferreting of information that was required to uncover the plot.  We see two very different protagonists in this book - Simon Ames - the bookish, Tower inquisitor, who shows really endearing qualities in his friendship with Becket (the other protagonist), and Agnes Fant whom he imprisons in his tower.  Mrs. Fant is the pregnant wife of a rich merchant and is the sister of one of the plotters.  Becket is entirely the opposite - a hard drinking, whore visiting, trained soldier who befriends Simon, and takes him under his wing after he saves his life at the beginning of the book.  What really makes this book special is the narrator, who is mad street beggar, who has very telling episodes of lucidity.  Because Ms. Finney tries to make the language more realistic to the era, the reader may find the book difficult to read at first, but if you persevere, you will not be disappointed.	2002-10-01

I really enjoy her writing and her plots.  Many people try to write in the English cozy style, but few are that effective.  It's easy to tell while reading this book, that it is written by a British person.  The style of writing, the characters and the actual mystery are reminiscent of some of the great British detective writers - Christie, Allingham, Sayers (but set in a more modern setting).  Affairs and sexual deviancies are common in Lloyd's and Judy's world.  That being said, Lloyd is good character.  He's sensitive, a little unsure of himself in his personal life, and he has a conscience.  That doesn't stop him from loving his perfect Judy though.  Judy is also a good character.  She is not afraid to show her uncertainties and her own guilty conscience.  This is a really good series, and even though I had figured out the murderer before the book was finished, it was still masterfully written and kept my interest.	2002-09-26

This second book in the series is just as enjoyable as the first.  Agatha Raisin is such a wonderful character in her own right, but in this book we are introduced to her neighbour James Lacey, and the book becomes twice as much fun.  It has been a long time since I have laughed out loud while reading a book, but this book made me do just that!  I will only say that the part where Agatha visits a washroom in a neighbouring village's pub is absolutely hilarious.  Also, in this book we see Agatha adopt a second cat - so that in itself is enough to keep my interest.  I can't wait to read number three.	2002-09-24

We are kept on the edges our seats as usual with Deaver's fast-paced plot.  There are all kinds of twists and turns and reading the book leaves you breathless.  I espeially liked the Chinese Cop - Sonny Li in this book.  Rhyme continues to become more human, and we see that his realationship with Sachs has progressed since the last book.  The story is based on the lucrative human smuggling business, and we learn about the sad people that are reduced to trusting these very criminal and sadistc traders in human flesh.  We also get a rare insight into the Chinatowns that are found in various cities throughout the US and Canada.  This is an excellent book, and I'm finding Deaver's characters are becoming more and more real and believable.	2002-09-23

Not so.  This book is the best in the series that I've read for awhile.  I can't get over how Ms. Braun can bring all her characters (both human and feline) to life the way she does.  She makes them so plausible that all their idiosyncracies and weird antics, don't seem strange at all.  In this book Koko shows his usual astuteness, and he leaves clues all over the book as a result of his numerous &quot;cat fits&quot;.  If you can follow these clues, you might guess the murderer.  That part's not that difficult, but the story is remarkably told, and a joy to read.  Reading a Lilian Jackson Braun book is like greeting old friends.  I strongly recommend this series.	2002-09-19

The book is a wonderful little mystery, and it has the minimalist plot that we come to expect from Lovesey.  The sad part was that this is the last book in the Cribb/Thackery Series.  I don't know why Mr. Lovesey stopped this series with this book.  It really didn't have the feel of a final book.  I haven't read his Peter Diamond series yet, but will try to get to those someday, but I will surely miss these wonderful characters.  This particular book is written so realistically that it seems he has been writing about a true crime.  That's a wonderful feat for a mystery from the Victorian era!.  I missed Thackery in this book, but Cribb was wonderful!  It's always sad when you reach the end of an enjoyable series.	2002-09-17

This is the second book in the series, and it's a good one.  If you're a fan of English cozies, then give this series a try.  Bill Slider is a real doll and his adventures in the fight against crime are good.  I really enjoy Ms. Harrod-Eagles writing, and I'm starting to really like her characters - Bill and his sidekick Ahterton (Mr. Perfect).  Dixon is wonderful too.	2002-09-14

Her books are certainly a lot more than just a cozy little whodunit, that entertains for evening.  She just keeps getting better and better, and her characters do the same.  This book is especially wonderful because we see so much more of Havers.  She is a wonderful character.  But everyone in this book seem so real.  The only character that I did not feel an empathy for was the ubiquitous Eve.  Does politics do that everyone?  But in spite of her, we see human foibles and weaknesses in a kaleidiscope of characters.  This book has everything - pathos, happiness, love, anger and of course, humour too.  I cannot recommend this series enough to anyone who truly wants to become a part of Elizabeth George's world.	2002-09-11

I find that Ms. Reichs gives very good forensic detail, but it is made interesting, so it's not boring &quot;textbook&quot; stuff.  I enjoyed this book as well, but found that the &quot;stem cell&quot; stuff got a little long.  Also, I don't know why we had to shift scenes to Guatemala.  Surely with Tempe's dual US/Canadian life, she can find enough to keep her busy without going further south.  Don't get me wrong, the history we learned about the atrocities that happened in Guatemala was good and it was accurate, but it just didn't ring true that Tempe would be there and getting involved in crime solving.  Not only that, but Ryan followed here there, and I thought this was not really explained away that well in the story.  But the story is good, Tempe is just as we love her, and on the whole I really enjoyed the book.	2002-09-04

Although I'd read one or two Hamish McBeth books, I had never cracked an Agatha Rasin before.  I wonder what I was waiting for.  This was a great book, and a wonderful heroine.  Really nobody can write an English cozy like M.C. Beaton!  Agatha is wonderful.  A tough, but vulnerable heroine, trying to make a place for herself in a clicky English village.  The characters in the book are as quirky as you can get, but very endearing.  Agatha is suitably eccentric, and a real treasure!  I can hardly wait to read more in this series.	2002-09-01

I still enjoy this series, and the characters are still pretty wonderful.  Yes, this mystery was pretty straightforward, and you know who did it and why.  I think I would have liked a little more exposure to the murderer's character - he seemed to be a shadowy figure at best in this one.  But Koko still delights, and Polly and Qwill are still wonderful.  For all cat fanciers, this series is a must!	2002-08-30

What I like the most is the extensive research that they put in each book, as well as the real life characters from that time that they insert in major roles in each story. This book is no exception. It was a fascinating insight into the infamous Whitechapel murders, and a very plausible theory as to who committed the crimes. Kathryn and Charles are wonderful sleuths, and in this book we see a very innovative Kathryn do some undercover detective work. Unfortunately, I had figured out the murderer of the blackmailer early in the narrative, but that didn't take away from my enjoyment of the book. This is a fun series, and you'll find that you become strangely attached to these people as you read.	2002-08-29

It was as entertaining as the first one - The Silver Pigs.  I think Ms. Davis gives her readers a rare view of ancient Rome, and Falco is a treat!  The books are funny and there is a good mystery in them.  In this one Falco has no shortage of suspects, and he gets in his usual scrapes trying to suss them out.  Helena plays more of a role in this book too, and I think she's going to be a real asset to Falco to help solve his crimes.  She can get into places and into households that he can't and helps him get the information he needs. It's almost like Thomas and Charlotte Pitt set in an much more ancient era.  Only this hero gets into a lot more scrapes, and gets beat up a lot more than poor Thomas ever does.  Read this series if you're looking for light-hearted, funny mystery stories.	2002-08-23

This is the second book in the Sister Fidelma series, and I have to say that I still don't really empathize with the good Sister.  She is way too pedantic, and bossy, and although I'm not sure about a woman's place in her world in Celtic Ireland, I can't think that they would have acted the way this woman acts.  This series is like Kinsey Mulhone without the frequent stops to McDonald's.  Tremayne tries to make Fidelma a hard-bitten private eye, but it doesn't seem to work because of the historical setting.  When I finished the book I felt unsatisfied.  Actually the mystery isn't too bad in this book, but the form of writing and the history are woefully inadequate.  I said that I'd read one more of the series after I read the first book, and then decide.  I think the jury is still out, so I think I'll try one more before I decide to scrap the rest.  If you're looking for a good medieval mystery with a wonderful story, and you've finished all of Ellis Peters' books, try Susanna Gregory.  There are seven books in the Matthew Bartholomew series, although Amazon only lists about two or three.  It's a wonderful series with a great sense of period.	2002-08-20

Her books are long and complex and rich in period detail. Her characterization of these famous medieval people is wonderful! My only complaint about this book was that it was so long in coming out to continue the saga started in the book When Christ and His Saints Slept. After reading the afterword I found out why - Ms. Penman was ill for quite awhile. I'm just glad she's better and is willing to continue the story of Eleanor and Henry II. This formidable couple cut a wide swath in English history, and Ms. Penman does an admirable job of recreating their life for our pleasure and enlightment. We even got a rare glimpse into the life of St. Thomas Beckett. Unlike a previous reviewer, I didn't think the book suffered from a lack of information about this strange and enigmatic man.<br />I find that Ms. Penman's books are spellbinding and can pull the reader into a story and a time very far-removed from the present frenetic lifestyle that we all lead. I cannot wait to read the last book in the series.	2002-08-12

I really am enjoying the Cribb-Thackery series, and this book has the added charm of a certain young lady by the Name of Harriet Shaw.  This is a wonderful Victorian series, and this book is a pure delight.  It connects The book &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot; and Jack-the-Ripper since these two things were all the talk of the people in 1889.  We are introduced to punting on the Thames, Oxford and Teacher's school as it was in England back then.  Cribb is his usual irascible self, and Thackery is still long-suffering and ponderous.  I am truly sorry that Peter Lovesey has only one more book left in this enjoyable series.  Each one has been wonderful and has introduced me to another aspect of Victorian life that I have never gotten in any other Victorian series.  And each one has been a cracking good mystery as well.	2002-08-06

I've read all three of Mark Graham historical Philidelphia mysteries.  I enjoy his stories.  His research is actually quite remarkable, and it gives the reader an insight into the past that they may not have had.  This book does that very well with the Centennial World Fair in Philidelphia.  It does make you sad that all that grandeur is gone, especially after what was spent.  It also gave me an insight into what World Fairs were like in their heydey.  Graham's writing though is rather simplistic.  This makes for quick reading of the book, and somehow the dialect and way of speaking didn't ring true with me for the era.  Also, where did the title come from?  The title really had no reference to the story at all.  The mystery was pretty good, although I had figured out the guilty one by about 1/3 of the way through the book.  But I still enjoyed the story and the sense of history that Mr. Graham instills.  That's why I gave this book a higher rating than the grammar and writing skills warranted. I disagree with one of the previous reviewers viewpoints that if you really want &quot;the smell and stink of the open sewers, read Anne Perry&quot;.  I have read all Ms. Perry's books and I enjoy them immensely, but Mr. Graham's novels do really give that sense of time and place just like Ms. Perry's. His extensive research helps him achieve this. But if you really want the smell and stink, as well as the sense of place, correct grammar and syntax, I highly recommend Peter Lovesey's Cribb and Thackery novels.  They're the best I've read on this era.	2002-08-01

He's so human and so likeable with all of his human shortcomings and uncertainties.  Troy, his partner, is quite despicable actually.  He's such a chauvinist, and quite full of himself, but again, he's so believable.  Ms. Graham draws very real characters.  Even the quirky people involved in this particular mystery are so finely drawn that they are recognizable.  Ms. Graham writes in the \\"cozy\\" genre, but her books are really anything but cozy.  There is enough murder and mayhem for anybody if they take the time to read her books.  This book does such a good job of descrbing cult life that it appears the author has personal experience with this type of lifestyle.  I sincerely recommend this series for those mystery readers are looking for something a little different, and for characters and situations quite out of the ordinary.	2002-07-28

I've read each of Amy Tan's subsequent books.  Her first book was a rare and wonderful story and a true joy to read.  Of all the later books this is the one that I enjoyed the least.  It's not a bad book, and it's not even a bad story, but I expect so much more from Ms. Tan.  I enjoyed the middle section of this story the most - the one that goes into the past in China.  That part had a lot of Amy Tan's wonderful prose and characterization.  I enjoyed the last part of the book the least.  It seemed unfinished somehow, and left me wondering what was the purpose of transporting us to China just before the War and the Communist revolution?  Ms. Tan's mediocre efforts are better than most author's best, so I also am not sorry that I took the time to read this book.	2002-07-25

I have been working my way through Elizabeth George's Havers and Lynley series, and I seem to enjoy each book more than the last.  This book is a masterpiece.  It's the finest piece of fiction that you can find, and it has a mystery too!  Ms. George's plots have the trademark of seeming to be apparently simple at the beginning, and as the reader delves into the story, she peels away layer after layer of personal history of her main characters, and the ones that just appear in this particular installment.  This unravelling continues until the end when the mystery is solved and all the characters inner torments are revealed.  Her writing is hypnotic, unforgettable, and totally addicting.  This book is no different, but somehow I felt it was even deeper than some of the previous ones I've read.  For one thing Ms. George examines Human sexuality in more detail than she has in other books.  The emotion in this one seems rawer and more real too.  In this book we don't see as much of Havers as we usually do, and that's a loss, since she's so great, but Lynley is totally awesome here, so it makes up for it somewhat.  Elizabeth George is a true artist and is fast becoming a real favourite of mine.	2002-07-19

It continues the story of Lugh the Harper and the terrible Queen of Connaught.  As I read the book I knew what was going to happen in the end in the final battle, but it did not diminish my pleasure in the story.  This book, like the first one, is written in the first person, so it really personalizes the story.  It felt like I was there as a guilty observer to the grand passions, intrigue, love and battle scenes.  Ms. Finney is a wonderful writer, and her research is superb.  Even though these books are out of print, I strongly recommend that you try to order them from your local library.  For anyone who loves ancient Celtic history, this two-part series is a must.	2002-07-10

The detail the author offers is remarkable.  The story is a fantasy in some respects, but it is also realistic.  It's a story of love and vengeance, honour and cowardice, treachery and bravery quite like none I've read before.  If you would like to know what this very distant past was like in the island of Ireland, you will certainly get a good idea by reading this book.he incidents and battles that occurred are remembered from legend and they are very carefully and completely described by this very talented author.  Because the story is told in the first person by the narrator, who is Lugh, it gives a really personal slant to these events, and we as readers become directly involved.  Luckily I have the sequel The Crow Goddess waiting for me to read right away.  I truly want to find out what happens after the famous battle of Erin and Ulster in the second century AD.	2002-07-05

In this book we find out about another aspect of Victorian England - smuggling and other nefarious schemes.  There are actually two storylines in this book, and the authors deal with both of them very well.  They certainly keep their readers interested.  I like the obvious research that goes into each one of these books, and the totally different view that we are given about life in England just before the turn of the last century.  The books are always enteratining and we get a history lesson too.	2002-07-01

I love Victorian mysteries, and this series is different enough that it's quite a treat to read.  The intrepid Sergeant Cribb and his sidekick Thackery are on the tail of the spirit world in this book.  The occult and things ghostly was quite popular for the \\"quality\\" in the late 1800's.  They held seances, and looked for manifestations just like what happens now.  But Cribb is not to be taken in by spirit meddling, and he uncovers the murder and the killer in his usual understated style.

For one thing there is no Ruby Wilcox, and I for one really missed her, as well as other eccentric citizens of Pecan Springs.  It was interesting to look back at China's early life, and the mysitical theme was actually quite well done.  This wasn't a mystery though in the true sense of the word.  It's more a search for the past in China's mother's family.  I still enjoyed the book, but I do want to get back to the main storyline in the next book in the series.  We also see China getting softer and more feminine in each book.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I hope she doesn't get too soft since her toughness is part of the appeal of this series.	2002-06-25

This book was interesting because it told us about the earlier life of Lynley, St. James, Lady Helen and Deb. We got bits and pieces of the whole situation in her previous books, but never the whole story. It helps explain a number of things and different character traits and undercurrents from previous books. And Ms. George can write! Her novels are so much more complex than simple little \\"who-dunits\\". The story takes the reader along on Ms. George's own little Magic Carpet ride, and nothing exists for us except Lynley and his friends. We even get a short preliminary look at Barbara Havers in this book. She is by far my favourite character, and I miss her absence, but realize that she wasn't part of Lynley's life during the time setting of this book. I look forward now to continuing with the storyline in subsequent books, and feel that I have a better understanding now of why Tommy thinks and acts the way he does.	2002-06-20

Yes, I read the book, but it's not a mystery in the true sense of the word.  The villain was apparent all the way through.  The book is more like a Romantic history than a mystery, and that's not my cup of tea.  I was recommended this author by Amazon as well, and thought I had a winner of a series after I read Silver Pigs, but I'm not so sure now.  I find the reading a bit difficult since Falco is almost \\"too precious\\" for words.  He appears to take nothing seriously (except his ladylove Helena, and even that is touch and go).  I did enjoy the history, and the travel log of the countyrside in Ancient Rome.  I will try one more in the series to see if the fun of Silver Pigs is recaptured.	2002-06-13

I was pleasantly surprised.  It's a pretty good little mystery.  The plot keeps you guessing right through.  It's also a twist when you have too many self-confessed killers in the classic \\"closed door\\" mystery story.  Lloyd and Judy are an interesting detective pair.  It's intersting to see their personal story unfold along with the plot.  I think I may try to read more in this series to see if Ms. McGown continues to create classic little puzzles like this one.	2002-06-07

This book was definitely the best of the bunch. I have not read the latest one yet, but intend to in the near future. This is the story that lays the plot for all the books in the series, and it is a stunner. It is so real that it's like Ms. Auel is writing of someone we know. We all feel that we are friends of Ayla by the time we get into the story. I found that Ms. Auel whetted my appetite for other prehistoric novelists, and that turned me to Kathleen and Michael Gear, who I also recommend by the way.	2002-06-07

The era is an interesting one, and there is some pretty good history here if you're interested in early Christianity and Ancient English history.  Sister Fidelma is no Brother Cadfael, and her tame puppy partner (Brother Eadulf) is not Brother Michael (Susanna Gregory's secondary character), but there is something here that bears reading at least another in the series.  I found that I had the murderer long before the unveiling, but I still enjoyed reading how they were going to prove it.  The motive was also pretty apparent.  I will reserve judgement until after I've read one or two more in this series.	2002-06-05

This book does not disappoint. The way Mark Graham melds actual history with a deep mystery is superb.  This book is not for the faint of heart.  If you really don't want to know what life was like in the late 1800's in Philedelphia, don't read this book.  If you can't face the racism and rampant corruption in civic positions that occurred then, also don't read this book.  This book is meant to make us feel uncomfortable in our complacency.  This book has it all, racial tension, corruption, murder, phsycotic criminals, and even a little love mixed in.  McCleary is a tough, but honest cop with a uniquely human and vulnerable side.  He has to face his own demons as he deals with real-life ones.  This is a great series.<br />Some of the grammar and English is not of the highest order, but I found that I did not mind and the story helped me overlook this.	2002-06-02

The story does not measure up to these.  But if you read the story wanting to read an entertaining mystery with some interesting characters, you will enjoy the book.  I found the writing and the history in this book were somehow lacking, but as I said I will try another in the series before I pass judgement.  I like Simon and I like Sir Baldwin, but they talk like modern people.  The sense of time and place is not here.  The book doesn't take you back like it should.  So, I will forego a little authenticity for now, and will see if this improves in subsequent books.  In the meantime I just enjoyed the story.	2002-05-30

The document forensics is good though, and there are some good spots in the story.  Parker is not as good as Lincoln Rhyme, but it was interesting that they did contact him near the beginning of the book for forensic advice.  There is some excitement in the book, and that is why I gave it a 3 instead of less.  I will continue to read Jeff Deaver, and hope for more Rhyme.	2002-05-24

This book starts out slow, but the first 1/3 is the best description of holidaying in Brighton in the latter part of the 19th century that I've ever read.  Then when Cribb and Thackery are called in to solve a grisly murder, the book becomes a cracking whodunit.  The story is complex and has a surprising ending.  At first I didn't understand the meaning of the title, but that too becomes clear when it is determined who the initial murderer is.  Cribb is wonderful in this book.  The more that I read this series, the more I wish there were more books than the seven that were written in this particular series.  Mr. Lovesey could teach classes on writing tight plots, and ingenious mysteries. He also achieves a real sense of time and place that you don't often see, especially in murder mysteries.	2002-05-22

It was enjoyable because I love \\"cozies\\".  This one is quite different than the typical English village where death upsets the daily lives of the villagers, but it sure reminded me of Ngaio Marsh.  For those of you who have read Ms. Marsh, you know that she sets her mysteries around English theatre.  This book by Ms. Graham is set around an English theatre company, and all of the innuendos and undercurrants that surround a small country company.  It's a good story, and I found that I still really like Barnaby and Troy.  Ms. Graham is the first modern author that I have found that can write mysteries like the old English masters- Marsh, Dorothy Sayers, Agatha Christie and Margery Allingham.  Nice subplots, humour, characterization, ambience and setting.	2002-05-20

We get a good look at ballooning and automotive enthusiasts from the late Victorian era, and that part is fun.  The way Mr. Paige mixes historical with fiction is a treat.  I just found that the mystery wasn't very gripping.  Kate and Charles are an engaging couple.  We get a good look at early forensics, and some of the problems that were encountered when trying to introduce this fledging science into a court room.  But I found the ending kind of left me hanging.  There was no clear resolution.  Hoping for better things with the next book in the series.	2002-05-14

Each time I read another of her books I never cease to marvel at how well done they are.  The story is complex, the human psyche that she reveals is so real. And the mystery is good.  This book is particularly heart wrenching as it deals with the death of a young child.  Lynley and Havers find themselves caught up in so many underlying plots, and each one, as it is revealed, is worse than the last one that they discovered.  It has been a long time since I've read a book that deals with the dreadful death of someone young with so much compassion and empathy.  Yes, it's dreadful, but we the readers feel compelled to read it in order to find out who did this terrible deed, and we, like Lynley and Havers, try to make some sense of it.  I have enjoyed all the Elizabeth George novels that I've read, but this one is my favourite so far.  We see the human side of so many of the characters - Lynley, Havers, St. James and his wife Deborah - all are laid open to our view.  Hopefully, we too can feel compassion for them and their troubles.	2002-05-07

Again we're faced with the political consipiracy theory and the Inner Circle.  In this book Pitt is on his own.  His estimable wife and the irrepressible Gracie have been removed out of London for their own safety.  I for one miss them, but we still have Emily and Aunt Vespasia, and that's enough.  The characterization and the mystery are both wonderful in this book.  Ms. Perry seems to have found her stride again in the last two books in this series.  It is really awesome how she recreates the time and all the hidden counterplots in late Victorian England.  Even the characters appear to have been plucked right out of their setting and placed in this book for us  to get to know them.  We do get to know them.  We get to feel their joy and their pain. We learn what conventions must be followed at all costs, and what not to say when in society.  Ms. Perry can recreate this era like no other.	2002-05-02

This is the first book in what promises to be a fun series.  The dust jacket has a review by the eminent Ms. Ellis Peters (author of the Cadfael series, a personal favourite of mine), and the late Ms. Peters said that she loved the series, and wondered why she didn't think to write about ancient Rome.  Anything that Ms. Peters liked is certainly good enough for me, so that's why I read this book.  It is a wonderful book.  It's light, cheery and has a really good mystery.  Ms. Davis does a pretty good job of creating the scene and the era.  The book is funny, and Falco is a wonderful protaganist.  I certainly will read more about him and his charming Helena again.	2002-04-26

As if we needed any further proof of this.  Her detective novels are arguably the best on the shelves.  She not only writes a good mystery, but her character depiction is flawless.  There are many who attempt to write in this genre and to rival her, but none come close.  In this book she depicts a much softer Dagleish than we're used to seeing.  That probably has something to do with age.  Also, her depiction of the East Anglian region is wonderfully detailed.  The book carries the reader along in almost a dreamlike state, and then we're confronted with a horrifying murder that certainly serves to bring us back to earth.  As the mystery unfolds, we find we're again drawn into the story.  Ms. James leads us along her chosen path right up the the final paragraph.  She is simply great, and that's all there is to say about it.	2002-04-20

This is a great series because it melds the past and the present so seamlessly.  There are two entirely different stories, but they are both connected by the past and the book weaves in and out so effortlessly.  I really enjoyed the story, and the mystery (both past and present) was also gripping.  The characters are so real(even the ones from the past).  There is no other mystery series out there like this one, and all lovers of mystery and folklore should read this series.	2002-04-14

Like the two previous stories in the Cribb/Thackery story, this is a fetching little book.  Cribb and Thackery actually go underground in this story.  We the readers find out all about the Fenian movement from the 1880's.  Plus, like other books in the series, we learn something about a popular sport from that era.  In this case, it is hammer throwing, although the sport is really incidental to the story.  If I have any complaints about this story, it's  that we don't see much of Thackery, but Cribb is excellent and we know Thackery will be back in the next one.  This is a great series.  No one can get into to spirit of the Victorian era better than Lovesey.	2002-04-08

They are so opposite, but they work.  It's nice to see that Havers takes charge a bit in this book.  This is a fine example of an English &quot;cozy&quot;, and I liked the tight plot and the story was good too.  Ms. George usually has two or three main storylines going at once, and this book is no exception with two, and she has a talent for fully developing both as she gets through her story.  She's an excellent writer, and I really enjoy this series.  I can't wait to read another to see how the relationship between Havers and Lynley develops.  I hope to see more of the talented Miss Havers in the next books.	2002-03-30

As with all of Jeff Deaver's books, this one keeps you guessing until the end.  Never think you've got the whole story with one of his books because there will be more there to surprise you.  Having said that, I found that I didn't enjoy this book as much as The Bone Collector.  I don't know, maybe this one is a little too &quot;bloody&quot; for my taste, but the mystery is great and Amelia and Lincoln enter a new stage in their relationship.  Maybe because this book has so obviously got &quot;movie&quot; written all over it.  I used to think that Stephen King was the master at writing novels for the movies, but Deaver is going to be just as successful at this.  The forensics are good, but not as stunning as in the first one I found.  I will continue to read the series because it is exciting reading, but I'm going back to Tempe Brennan for my forensic fix.	2002-03-22

They are certainly deeper than your average who-dunit, and it takes a bit of effort to get into the plot, but once there it is well worth the effort. In many ways, this is probably Ms. Paretsky's strongest effort to date. She takes on some really deep and difficult issues, and handles them really well while weaving them into the stroyline of the book. This book centres around Lotty Herschel, the closest thing to a mother that VI has. We see how current events drag Lotty into an abyss that was her life as a Jewish child during the appalling Second World War. The book examines the lasting issues that have followed these Holocaust children throughout their life. Living in a free country, we can only imagine the horror and fright that these Jewish people went through, both those that were lucky enough to get away, and those so many that didn't. This is a powerful novel, and it grabs out the reader's guts and spits them out like none I've read for some time. It's complex and deep and if you take the time to read it, you won't be disappointed. In many ways (dare I say it) it reminds me of Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment. It is truly a classic.	2002-03-17

I really love her books.  Lynley and Havers are such a great team.  They are so opposite that they complement each other.  Ms. George is the best author of the psychological thriller that I've found.  This book is about relationships as much as murder.  The characters are as diverse as you'll find in any book, and the way Ms. George develops her characters is remarkable.  The book is long, but it doesn't seem that way when you're into it.  She takes the time to develop her characters and these are the most important part of her stories.  The plot is there, but the characters are the highlight.  This book shows what an obsessive relationship can cause, and how it affects more than just the two people involved.  Olivia is a dream - I absolutely loved her in this story and I wept along with her.	2002-03-09

I have read all the books in this series, in order, and that's the way I would recommend the series to anyone. I really like China and her friends. They seem like good old friends to me now after nine books. This is a really good example of a \\"cozy\\". Most of Ms. Albert's books in the series have had a lot more murder and mayhem with people getting shot and killed everywhere. That makes this one quite enjoyable. China can concentrate on solving the mystery, and not trying to dodge killers. I liked this book, but just the same, it is predictable. An astute reader will be able to pick up on Ruby's problem right away and maybe on the murderer too. Still I recommend this series. The characters that people these books are so very real, and I love them all.	2002-02-25

It helps that they delve into the history books, and use actual incidences that lend credence to their story.  This book talks about Queeen Victoria's son, Albert's propensity for married lovers - some of the worst kept secrets from that era.  Daisy was a real person and was actually involved with the Prince.  The story is realistic, and the characters are niceley portrayed.  I really like Charles and Kathryn and think they make a good detective team.  The mystery behind the story is a good one, and the motive is &quot;Oh so Victorian&quot;.  I recommend this series to those that enjoy this period.	2002-02-21

I really liked certain parts of the book, but the majority of it seemed disjointed and unbelievable.  It almost seemed that Ms. Reichs was out to shock us more than entertain us.  Even the forensics wasn't as thorough, but I did enjoy reading how major disasters are recreated and the cause determined.  I loved Boyd, and found him a great addition to the storyline.  I hope we'll seem more of him.  I just hope that Ms. Reichs takes a less unbelievable crime this time.	2002-02-18

Ms. George has very strong characters. She is also not afraid to tread in dark and secretive areas, as this book does. She does not tread softly either. Rather she enters in with \\"gumboots\\"! This is one of the best psychological thrillers I've read in some time, and I intend to continue with the series. Lynley and Havers are a great team. Yes, you'll find that you lose patience with Havers as she blunders her way through some very dicey situations, but don't be fooled - she is extemely intelligent under that dumpy exterior. Lynley is a true English gentleman, and a very deep character in his own right. Unrequited love has a place in this book along with other kinds of \\"love\\" that are not nearly so wholesome.	2002-02-09

Thackery is a gem.  You can just see him walking along in his bowler hat and black suit.  This book goes into the life in the music halls that were popular in the Victorian era.  Lovesey has a great sense of period, and that's what makes his books so entertaining.  I am really enjoying this series.  The mystery in this particular books isn't quite as good as the previous two in the series, but there is certainly enough to maintain your interest if you're a Victorian Mystery buff like me.	2002-02-05

I've always liked that series better than the Thomas and Charlotte Pitt series because the storylines are a bit darker and the characters more complex, but I didn't enjoy this book as much as the others in the series.  I found that it had trouble maintaining my interest.  I found it long and drawn out, with a very simple plot and storyline.  I did enjoy seeing a more human side to Monk.  He is my favourite character after all, and previous books have really not concentrated on him much.  I found when we got to the denouement that the murderer and the way the crime occurred was a bit of a stretch--how did we get to that murderer and that scenario?  Unbelievable and far-fetched.  I will still continue with the series because I want to see what happens with Monk and his getting to know more of his past, but I hope the next installment is more exciting.	2002-01-24

Now, I will need to begin at the beginning.  Ms. George can write a very good psychological thriller - along the lines of Minette Walters, but less creepy.  She is an excellent author, and really knows how to develop her characters.  I find I really want to get to know her two protaganists - Lynley and Havers.  As I was reading it was difficult at first to keep the two storylines apart, but once I mastered that, it went much better.  I felt so bad for Gideon.  What a terrible thing to suppress things in a child.  It causes all kinds of problems for the adult.  The book is long, but it goes quickly.  The writing is excellent - a true thinking-person's mystery.	2002-01-15

Her characters are what makes reading her books almost an addicition.  I'm a great fan of Melrose Plant and sometimes he almost supplants Jury in my affections - almost, but not quite.  Ms. Grimes can delineate characters and set an almost dreamlike quality to her books like no one else.  This book is more like this than some of her latest efforts.  It seems to go slow, and it jumps around a lot with a lot of extraneous information, but it does all make sense in the end - to a point.  This book is sad and sinister.  It weaves a spell that sucks the reader in to thinking that this is another one of Ms. Grimes' &quot;cosies&quot;.  And then bang.  It all becomes extremely real and deadly at the end.  Without giving away the entire plot I would like to mention that I hope we haven't heard the last of Jury, Plant, Carole Ann, Mrs. Wasserman, Diane and Marshall.	2001-11-28

I did things a bit differently and saw the movie before I read the book.  I really enjoyed the movie, but the book was even better!  This is a great suspense and mystery story, and the forensic detail is incredible.  The hero and heroine are totally different than what we usually get, but boy are they real!.  I think Lincoln Rhyme is phenomenal, and it certainly shows that physical handicaps do not impair brain power.  The book provides a lot more detail than the movie, as is usually the case with books done into movies, but both are extremely entertaining.  I recommend this book to anyone fond of mysteries and suspense.	2001-11-19

It was nice to see that this book seems to get Mr. Francis back into familiar form.  It's a really good thriller, and you learn a whole lot about glass blowing while enjoying the story.  I was very sorry to hear that Dick's wife has passed away since they co-wrote this book.  I do hope that he doesn't quit writing.  I understand that his wife did all the research for his books, and she did a fabulous job with this her last effort.	2001-11-15

It certainly isn't your normal romance story, and there is a definite feeling of hope that comes through.  It is a story about two very strong-willed people and how they clashed at first, and then found out that they complimented each other.  It's also a good view of the Jehovah Witness faith, and let's face it, there's not many books about that.  The writing is good, and the story moves along nicely.  I liked these characters and I think you will too.	2001-11-15

I was a little disillusioned after the previous two in the series, but this is a great one.  I really enjoyed the story, and the wedding sideline was a great one.  China is her usual rushed self in this story, and she's trying hard to concentrate only on her upcoming nuptials, but gets involved in spite of herself with another murder.  This murder is of a citizen of Pecan Springs, who no one will really miss that much (except his wife).  He's a sharpy, and he gets cut on his own misdeeds.  The story moves along swiftly, and we see China trying to get wedding plans in amongst murders, hurricanes and faled wedding cakes.  It's great.  Read this for a whomping good ride.	2001-09-30

This book just does not do it for me either.  I'm a great Kinsey fan and usually Ms. Grafton's story are fast-paced and exciting.  This one just isn't  I figured out the stuff about one of Purcell's wives right from the beginning, so that probably didn't help.  I found the stuff about double-dealing in the Health Care industry intersting, and that is why I gave this book a 3 instead of a 2.  I also liked the chrasimatic landlords that Kinsey was involved with, but again, all that transpired there was pretty predictable as well.<br />I will contine to read the series, but I hope Ms. Grafton gets her drive back again before &quot;Q&quot;.  I'm finding the series is losing momentum.	2001-09-22

I like Jack.  He's a tough, no-nonense guy and you never know what he's thinking.  He almost appears bigger than life, but the rest of his character is so understated that it seems to work.  This thriller certainly has a different twist to it than most, but I must admit I figured it out about halfway through.  That didn't detract from the story though because it moves fairly quickly and I wanted the time to get to know Jack.  I too was a bit disappointed with the ending.  I think it could have been done a bit better and not just left flat.  The book would then rate a 5 in my opinion.  Even though you could see the ending about halfway through, I thought the book interesting enough to finish.  The paint thing was a bit \\"over the top\\" though.  I enjoyed the previous three in the series more than this one, but I'm sure the next will be good again.	2001-09-20

I am stunned after completing this eighth book in the Niccolo series, but I'm also very, very sad.  I have now finished all fourteen books in Ms. Dunnett's saga and it saddens me to know that there is no new installment where I can lose myself in this quite remarkable family.  In this book we finally get a lot of answers as to why Niccolo acted as he did in all the previous books.  We see who is real enemy has been over the years and it is a surprise to all of his friends even though Niccolo has known all along.  He has tried to minimize the damage and tried to control this serpent in his midst, but finds that it can't be done and it comes to a sad, sad conclusion.  Niccolo faces great losses in this book, but he comes out a stronger man for them.  Ms. Dunnett is truly a master storyteller and I recommend that everyone read her series the way she suggests.  She suggests that you read the six Lymond chronicles in the right order and then these eight in the Niccolo series, and then go back and re-read the Lymond chronicles.  All will be much clearer and her prose is so complex that a first reading of all the books is not nearly enough to get all the complexities and double-dealings that occur as standard fare.  I am exhilerated after completing the series, but as I mentioned, very sad.  I don't think I'll find an author or a series to compare.  I would give the entire series of fourteen books ten stars if I could.	2001-09-16

This is the second book in his Victorian series starring Sergeant Cribb and the long suffering Constable Thackery.  Mr. Lovesey recreates the Victorian atmosphere very accurately.  And this is a new form of English cozy crime.  Mr. Lovesey seems to want to delve into the Victorian sports era.  This particular book is about &quot;knuckle fighting&quot; without the mittens as they call it.  There was a huge following of this sport in England at this time despite the fact that even watching was illegal.  We get right into the whole area and learn all about the clothes, the gear and the lingo.  On top of that it's a cracking good thriller.  I certainly intend to read more in this series.  I am thourougly enjoying it.	2001-09-06

Brilliant Nicholas has been exciled to Poland.  He tries to forget all of his previous life and become a devil-may-care pirate, but his history keeps coming in to interfere, and he has to resume his life in order to protect those that are dearest to him.  In this book we contine to see the beautiful Anna, Julius's wife, and without giving the story away she is certainly not what she seems.<br />We also see Nicholas and Gelis get back together at the end of the story.  That is indeed a happy occasion, but it puzzles me where Katalejne fits into this.  We don't see much of her in this story, and that is a great loss since I for one feel that she is by far the superior heroine in this series.<br />I can't wait to read the last book in the series.  Perhaps then things will all make sense.  I found that there were some similarities between this series and the Lymond series, and that disappoints a bit, since the Lymond series is so superior.  But this is still a good series and it's well worth the time spent to read it.  I recommend reading all the books in the series in the order that they written.	2001-08-31

I really enjoyed this book.  The forensic information is first-rate and the thriller aspect of the book is also good.  I enjoyed this story more than the previous one.  I found the plot more exciting and a little more believable.  There are still a few coincidences - how is that her nephew Kit arrived just when she is investigating Outlaw Biker Gangs and it just so happens that he has a tremendous interest in this topic too!  But in spite of that this is a cracking good read.  I have to admit that my interest in bikes is more than just a passing one since I ride myself, although I don't own a Harley.  Also, the topic is very timely for Canadians since Outlaw Biker Gangs are big news around here.  It was interesting to read some of the history behind them.  I like Tempe.  She's funny, classy and a little hard-nosed, but vulnerable at the same time.  For anyone interested in forensics this is a good author.  Her knowledge is very good since she is in the business herself.	2001-08-23

This is a delightful Victorian mystery.  We are introduced to a wonderful Beatrix Potter, and we get to meet characters from her books - like Jemima Puddle Duck, Peter Rabbit, Mrs. Tiggy-Wiggle.  Plus we get to see more of feisty Kate Ardleigh.  This is the second book in the Kate Ardleigh series and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The characters are warm and fun, and the Victorian times are depicted so wonderfully!  The murder and mayhem are good and of course half the fun is in the detecting of who actually did the dastardly deed!  I am enjoying this series, and if you like warm, funny Victorian mysteries, you will too.	2001-08-20

I enjoyed the story.  Detective Cribb and his sidekick are quite unique and the setting is certainly so.  It takes place during a six day foot race.  These were apparently quite common in the Vicotrian age, where participants would go around a track inside a building for six days - totally 624 miles.  They take time off for eating and sleeping (about 3 hours a night), but the winner is the one who completes the most miles in the allotted time.  This is a pretty good mystery, and the hero is wonderful.  Don't expect an Anne Perry, but the story is entertaining.  I intend to read the others in the series.	2001-08-18

We finally find out the result of the five year feud between Nicholas and Gelis, and the ending is still a cliff-hanger, but it does explain a few things.and gets us hyped up for the seventh book in the series.  Ms. Dunnett is an excellent author.  Yes, the history is good, but don't get into this series just for that.  It's entirely too complicated and the continuous plot is a brain stretcher.  I found that I actually started to like Nicholas in this book, and I really haven't before.  He is a brilliant manipulator, and his long term planning is incredible, but he is human after all.  His friends and acquaintances are just as interesting.  I love Tobie and was glad to see him back. He is such a foil for Nicholas and is almost like his conscience.  Katelejna is wonderful, and we see more of her.  I can't wait to read the next book.	2001-08-15

In this book a chili cookoff judge is murdered (at least China and Mike think he was muredered).  China was back to her usual confident, independent self in this story, and thank goodness no further mention of McQuaid's indiscretions.  Ruby is her usual kooky self, and I think she is the character that makes this series worth reading.  China uncovers a dastardly plot on her own this time because McQuaid is recovering from a serious gunshot wound that he received in the last book.  She does get advice and help though from McQuaid and from Ruby who comes just in the nick of time at the end.  A really good mystery, and it restored my faith in the series.	2001-07-23

Yes, the setting is the same - England during the Victorian age, but the writing is totally different.  This series does not dwell on the dark side as much as Ms. Perry's do.  But it's a good start to what looks like a promising series.  It's a good mystery and there is enough diversity of characters to keep you interested.  Kate Ardleigh is a wonderful heroine.  She's smart, sassy and gritty, as well as a genuinely nice girl.  Charles Sheridan is a find as well.  A true studier of the criminalistic arts.  There is a lot of Vicoriana lore in the book, but that adds to the charm if you are a buff like me.	2001-07-20

We can only imagine the harshness of the climate and the topography.  Ms. Smiley does a very good job of portraying this with the minimialist style she uses for this book.  As hard as life was for these folk, they still knew how to love, laugh and have fun sometimes.  They were entirely fatalistic in their responses to everything that is thrown at them - starvation, death, killings and above all else - rumours.  None expected life to be easy, and knew that death is as much a part of life as anything, so they determined to make the most of what time they had.  I found the characters intriguing in this story.  They are dour, yes, but they also display a great deal of empathy and humour.  This is a very good tale, and it certainly gives a new look at another part of our great world.	2001-07-04

The idea behind this book is a good one, and if it had been properly handled it would have carried it off.  Unfortunately, it wasn't properly handled.  There was so much going on with this book it was hard to keep the bad guys straight. Why would two normal people keep a found child that doens't belong to them, and from where did the \\"madness\\" come that made Susan think it was her lost baby?  Why did Bobby go along with it?  There are more quetions left unanwered than what was answered.  For example, Samuel apparently goes through a metamorphisis where he becomes angry and wants to kill the people that killed his brother, and then he totally forgets this and lets them go while he goes after the child.  Then he feels protection for the child and gets hurt because of it.  I could go on, but that would give the whole book away so will stop.  I wouldn't recommend this book.	2001-06-18

The idea is a good one, and the retro aspect of the 40' and 50's could be a good one, but Mr. Follett does not take the time to explore it properly.  The character development is a bit weak, and the plot is simplistic compared to earlier works by this author.

It does get a bit melodramatic, and Martha Claire is a bit too much to be believed.  Would a man like Grayson stick around all those years with a woman who is as self-suffering as she is?  I liked the interplay within this family, and I liked the setting.  I have never seen Columbus Texas, but Ms. Wall certainly writes like she knows it well. Justine and Iris are wonderful characters.  I would not have enjoyed the book without them.  As for Cissy - I found that I didn't get to feel the same affinity for her.  I found her a bit &quot;milksoppy&quot;.

This book, like Sparks' previous books is a true romance.  It is hard to believe that these books are written by a man.  Usually the romance genre is tackled only by women authors.  This is a romance book with a different twist - Denise is a single mom with a small child with a disability to raise.  In other aspects she is a completely normal woman with no excess baggage.  In this case it's the man that is carrying the excess baggage and we find out that this is what has stopped him from really living (of course until Denise comes along).  A lot of the book is predictable.  After the first four chapters, I knew who was going to get killed in the story.  I also knew that this death was necessary to snap Taylor out of his self-defeating lifestyle. Not to give anything  away, I won't say who did die.  You'll have to read this book to find out.  Go ahead.  Read it if you like romances.  You'll love this book.	2001-06-08

She's smart, savy and quick-witted.  Her quirky friends are half the fun too.  This one just didn't do it for me as much as the others.  The actual mystery was pretty good.  There were a lot of plot twists and underlying issues like all her previous stories, but I had this one figured out by the end.  I won't give anything away, but there's something rotten in the Ranger emporium.  What I really didn't like, and what seemed unbelievable due to China's previous shows of independence was the fact that she blamed herself for her lover's infidelity!  What's going on with That?  I certainly hope that Ms. Albert redeems her heroine in the next outing.	2001-06-07

Daughter leaves home and mother pretends that she doesn't want much to do with her anymore.  The book is quite funny, but sad at the same time.  It's definitely a &quot;chick book&quot;.  I received it as a gift from my sister.  I probably wouldn't have read it otherwise.  I thought the story was good, the southern charm wonderful, and Sidda's fiance is a dream. A major difference is how this book is presented.  The scrapbook of the Ya-Ya's is the common thread thoughout, and it is quite effective as a plot welder.	2001-06-06

For one thing the heroine is a female (dressed as a BOY).  I enjoyed the story it was fun and it kept my interest through the book.  The story is bawdy and earthy, but so was life back then.  Although the plot was a bit far-fetched, it was entertaining.  It certainly puts a new light on a &quot;love triangle&quot;, and I think really portrays what life was like on the all-male crusades where knights went to the Holy Land for years without the benefit of female company.  This is an excellent book to add to your repretoire if you are a Middle Ages junkie like I am.	2001-05-24

I enjoyed this book much more than the previous - Scales of Gold.  Maybe because Ms. Dunnett went back to her original form of storytelling which combines history, geography, romance and high drama.  This is an &quot;edge of your seat&quot; type of book even though it is longer than the others previously in this series.  We see Nicholas with a whole new talent to add to his arsenal - that of divining.  Yes these books are a bit soap-operaish, but they are exciting nonetheless.  In this particular segment we get to see a lot more of Dr. Tobias.  He is a treasure, and a great foil for Nicholas' impulsiveness.  His Love-Hate relationship with Nicholas continues, but also develops into a trust.  I wondered why Nicholas didn't take this earthy doctor into his confidence sooner.  Toby is a wonderful character!  We also see a confrontation between Nicholas and his erstwhile father, but true to form, it is not resolved, so we know we have to read further.  I wouldn't recommend this series to the faint of heart.  It takes a lot of effort and emotion to get through it, but it is worth it in the end, if only for the history lesson.	2001-04-27

This is the third or fourth book in the Dolly series, but I couldn't get the others first. My curiosity was piqued because I love Dorothy Dunnett's writing so much. This is as different from the Lymond and Niccolo series as possible, but a really good thriller. Even though the title sounds like a children's book, this book is certainly not that. Dolly is a large yacht and the hero is a bookish, bifocal wearing master spy from Britain MI6. The Bird in this book and the others is girl who gets embroiled with Johnson for some reason or other.  This book keeps you guessing right up to the end. It is hard to follow all the way through since the characters are so bright and oh so brittle with their humour, but it's worth persevering with. I would like to continue to read what I can find of this series. It's actually quite a bit of fun.	2001-04-17

We only see her at the beginning, and there were no real harmless eccentrics in this one, and I think that is what Ms. Albert does so well.  Also, the mysteries were a little simple compared to her other plots.  I will continue to read the series because I love China Bayles so much.  I'm also curious to see what she does with her life after she has reflected in the nunnery.	2001-04-12

I defy anyone to read it and keep a dry eye throughout.  Rosamunde Pilcher's stories are so wonderful.  They're like a nice warm quilt and a hot cup of tea.  Her characters are warm and wonderful, and she talks about real people like no other author. The characters in this book are no exception.  They are wonderful!  You will love to be a part of their lives in this beautiful, but chilly setting.  Scotland seems really beautiful when you read about it like this.  This is an enjoyable, happy book and we all need more of that these days.	2001-04-09

It's more a political story than a mystery in some ways, but the mystery is still there, and Ms. Perry keeps you guessing until the very end.  This book is quite a bit different than the later Thomas Pitt series, but still exciting.  Thomas has offended some very highly placed political enemies, and they have seen that he has been separated from his wife and family and placed in the degraded East End of London, to ostensibly look for anarchits.  More than anarchists are found though, and this plot threatens the whole Engligh way of life as it was known at this time in history.  We see Charlotte and Vespasia play less dominant roles in this book than they usually do, but Gracie has stepped up to the plate and what a delight she is!  This is an excellent mystery, and again the era is so well depicted it feels like you're actually there.	2001-04-09

I guess I just don't really care for Carol Starkey.  Yes, it's a dark novel, but she's just too tough to be believed!!  Even when she does warm up to someone, she doesn't warm up.  There's no vulnerability here, and we need that in order to develop a liking for her.  Even before I read the author's bio, I knew that this author had written television screenplays.  This book reads like a screenplay.  It's fast-paced and gritty, but there's little time for plot development, and the ending is rushed.  This book just didn't do it for me, although it is exciting enough.  I'll wait to see it on television.	2001-04-03

It is certainly a new take on an old love story.  This modern day Romeo and Juliet are in their sixties and it's their children who provide the dissention.  This book is quite humourous and heart-warming.  Apparently, this is a first novel for this author, and I think the result is very good.  The author is apparently a senior and a grandmother.  She must have a good sense of humour becuase she sure has given her heroine that in this story.  This is a very quick read, but lots of fun.  I look forward to more from this author.	2001-04-02

I love Dorothy Dunnett's writing, and the way she describes the exotic places that our hero visits is extraordinary.  This book covers the mysterious land of Africa.  We see so much majesty and grandeur here, especially in fabulous Timbuktu.  We see a much more mature Nicholas as he finds and admits real friends into his world.  Godsalc and Loppe finally get to see some of the true Nicholas.  Diniz is a real treasure and I really like this character.  Nicholas' group faces real danger and privation in this book and none of them that attempt the adventure come back the same.  Nicholas does manage to regain and even add to his fortune.  Something that is different in this book is that there is not much description of what happened on the trip that Nicholas and Godsalc took to find Ethiopia.  We also didn't hear much about the trip across the Sahara.  This is indeed different for Ms. Dunnett, since these two events are what really changed Nicholas outlook and his dealings with his people. She always goes into quite vivid details about side trips that Nicholas has taken in previous books.  Now why, after I have extolled all the virtues of this book have I only given it a 4 instead of a 5?  Because I felt cheated at the end of the book.  Yes, it's a clever cliffhanger, and it does make you want to continue reading the other books to find out if Nicholas does find his true love, but to me it seemed like &quot;grandstanding&quot;, and that's not like the Dorothy Dunnett that I know and love.  I won't reveal the ending for those of you who want to read the book because it would spoil it for you, but suffice it to say that there is nothing in the previous 500 pages to explain why she chose this way to end the story.  Yes, I will continue to read the series, but I must admit that I was disappointed and angry after I closed the covers on this one.	2001-03-29

I strongly recommend that you begin at the beginning and read them in order.  It's not necessary in order to enjoy this book, but it helps.  Then you will see how much gentler China is becoming.  She is certainly not as &quot;hard-bitten&quot; a heroine like VI Warshawski or Kinsey Mallone, but I like her because she is the way she is. This is a good series and, as always, there is lots of good plant information in this book.  Unfortunately, I figured out &quot;who-donuit&quot; about 1/2 way through the book, but it didn't spoil the story.  I hope that in subsequent books in the series, which I will be reading, Ms. Albert does not leave such glaring clues.  I like being held in suspense until the end.	2001-03-19

The charactization is quite complex for a novella.  It's just unfortunate that Catherine is so unredeemably staid.  I realize that quite a few women chose to live a life alone in those days, but she seemed quite plodding to me.  She does develop into a spinster that seems to enjoy that state.  And Morris is quite the cad, but we the readers are never in any doubt as to that.  The doctor father is another story,  He's so right-minded that it's difficult to imagine anyone could be that stubborn.  And the widowed aunt is a treasure - silly, manipulative and oh so romantic.  This novella is written like a play since there are only four main characters, and most of the action takes place in the house on Washington Square.  I really think this book looks deceptively simple, but it is not as simple as it appears.  I enjoyed the story.	2001-03-15

In this book China takes on a challenging case to try to absolve her friend of a murder that was staged to look like she had done it.  China relies on her lawyer friend and her very eccentric friend Ruby to help her friend, the town eccentric called the &quot;cat lady&quot;.  We also see China take the big step of a committment with her boyfriend.  There's enough murder and mayhem as well as gardening information to satisfy anyone who is of that bent.	2001-03-15

I found this one lacking a great deal in background information, and this is important if an author wants the reader to get into their hero or heroine's life.  That doesn't happen with this book, and we don't have any of Nell's earlier life, or even her earlier married life with her husband, so we the reader cannot form our opinions about Nell or Adam for that matter.  The action is fast-paced and the premise behind the story is a good one, but it's too sketchy for me.	2001-03-14

This, third in the Niccolo series is a wonderful book that depicts the unsettledness of the Island of Cyprus.  We learn that this tempestuous island has always been an important one because of its strategic location.  I enjoyed this book, because we actually got to see some of the mask come off Nicolo in his encounter with his Katelina.  In true Dunnett fashion, this encounter did not take place in a private and safe bedchamber, but in a place where nature abounded, as well as danger.  The history that we find out in this book is also equally interesting and true to what actually happened.  This is certainly another great series.	2001-02-26

I love Vangie Worth, and the way that Susan Wilson tells her story is quite unique.  She switches from different times and places, and the way she weaves her tale the reader is carried away with it.  It's like reading about a quite lovely dream.  This is a poignant love story that lasts through five decades even though the two people only are together for 7 months so long ago.  Reading this book is like slipping into a warm, scented, steaming bath.  Give yourself the pleasure.	2001-02-09

The idea behind this story is good, and the things it tries to teach are valid, but I'm sorry, the plot was quite unbelievable.  To me it didn't seem realistic at all, and that detracted from what could have been.  How much tragedy does one family have to face?  How much coincidence is believable?  All questions that come up while reading this book.  I don't buy that a seventeen year-old? can make this kind of life decision.  I also don't buy that a fifteen year old would make the kind of decision that this boy does at the end.	2001-02-09

His hero-Lincoln Rhyme is a treasure. Who'd ever think that an author could make a character like this so believable. Rhyme is a quadriplegic, and although his intelligence is certainly not impaired from his accident, his mobility sure is, but he has two great characters to help him do the \\"leg work\\" so to speak. Amelia and Thom are wonderful, and the other people that he brings in like Lucy in this case gather all the information, and take all the chances, and Rhyme sits back and analyzes what the evidence states. This is a really exciting book, and in typical Deaver fashion, it keeps you guessing all the way through. Don't ever think the action is complete until you get to the last page. This is my favourite Lincoln Rhyme novel.  I had to read it again because the plot is so intricate and I got more out of it the second time.	2001-02-07

I also did not read the first book in the series.  The idea behind the book is a good one.  They way six or seven women stitch their lives into a quilt, but there is just too much happening for one small quilting bee- potential infidelity, graduate school drop-out, marital breakdown, incapacitating strokes, misfit teenagers!  Come on.  I do like the way the various stories are woven together, though, but I too felt the ending was a bit weak.	2001-02-01

The characters are very realistic.  For example, Carl Gillbride is an ego-driven doctor- where have we seen that before?  Palmer's story is exciting to read.  It's not a book you want to put down once begun.  Jessie is a treasure-smart, quick-witted and funny.  You will like her right away. I recommend Palmer's other medical thrillers as well. His villains are really bad people, but they are very realistic and they will scare the life out of you.	2001-02-01

Nelson usually writes &quot;edge-of-your-seat&quot; suspense but this book didn't do that for me.  I find it rather predictable.  I like John Corey, and find him believable, but the heroine was less so, and their relationship seemed somewhat stilted.

Reading this book is like taking a magic carpet to a mystical place.  Ms. Dunnett has the knack of taking her readers to whatever era and place in the world she chooses.  In this book our Niccolo has matured somewhat but he still has some hard lessons to learn about how lonely it is to be a leader.  He also has to learn that a true leader leads without his employees or friends knowing that that is what he's doing.  In fact, these books of Niccolo could be used for demonstrating leadership.  I'm surprised that no corporate videos have been made from them.  This is a good book even though Niccolo fails to fascinate as much as Lymond does, but I don't think there ever can be another Lymond. I don't find the characters as likeable in this series for one, and Catherine is certainly no Philippa (at least not yet), but there is high adventure, intrigue and enough court gossip to keep anyone interested in the politics of the 15 century.	2001-01-24

Make no mistake about it.  This hero is different entirely from the refined and genteel Lymond.It took me awhile to get used to that.  Once I did I found I enjoyed the book.  Again, it's not an easy read since Ms. Dunnett's plots are intricate and her characters are not what they appear on the outside.  This character looks like he is going to be dangerous as well as extremely clever! I just hope that he's as entertaining as Lymond was.Who knows, maybe I may &quot;like&quot; him better as I found Lymond very difficult to &quot;like&quot;. Ms. Dunnett peoples her book with her usual interesting and diverse characters, and the usual villains.  A good start to a brand new series for me.	2001-01-17

Kinsey is an endearing character, and Ms. Grafton makes her seem so real, and so likeable.  It was really nice to have a book dedicated to her younger life before she became the hard-bitten PI that we know and love.  In this book we find a softer and much more likeable Kinsey and I'm sure the tender feelings that she finds she carries for this, her first husband, probably surprised her more than anything else while she discovers his life in the intervening years since their marriage.  For someone just starting to read the series, this really isn't a bad book to begin with, and it will certainly whet your appetite for the rest. It's a quick and very satisfying read, and I can't wait now until the P book comes out.	2001-01-06

I am a particular fan of the William Monk series, so I was a bit disappointed with this one.  I found that it was very easy to get the mystery.  Ms. Perry's characters are still good, and very well drawn.  Her description of the Battle of Bull Run was quite refreshing.  Having the story take place in two continents is a bit different for her, but I like the American segment quite well.  I do hope further William Monk stories will be as good as all the others previously were.	2001-01-04

This book is a masterpiece, and the &quot;piece-de-resistance for the Lymond chronicles.  The whole series was wonderful, and I would recommend reading it all in order, but this book was just wonderful!  The suspense and plot twists will keep you guessing right up until the very last chapter.  I find that reading Ms. Dunnett's books can be tiring because there is so much going on and you have to keep your wits about throughout the whole story.  Her characterization is incredible, and the sense of feel for the time is like something I've never seen.  I'm going to start on the Niccolo series now.	2001-01-04

This second book in the Ansazi mystery series is as thrlling and exciting as The Visitant.  I for one happen to love the mix of old and new story lines that thread through the book.  In fact, the murders and even the pehistoric lifestyle and characters are so well written that it didn't feel like I was reading history.  The story is probably one of the most violent and graphic of all the Gear's books, but that was what it was really like back then.  If you like heart-stopping action and a really well-crafted mystery this is the book for you.  Be prepared though to be hooked, as it looks like there are more to come in this series since this book does leave unsettled things as did the last one.	2000-12-18

He is extremely hard and bitter, and appears to have no loyalties to friendship while he tries to make his point.  Even so, I find I still have to keep reading because these books are so powerful.  In this book Lymond falls in love, but in true Lymond fashion, feels that he can't share this with anyone, let alone his lady love.  I await with much trepidation the final installment in this series in order to find out if Lymond bears any human characteristics or not.	2000-12-14

It's a great mystery set in a scene that is so real, it's hard to believe it occurred centuries ago.  The characters are alive - both the prehistoric and the modern ones, and the storyline is totally fresh, and enthralling.  I have read all the Gears &quot;People&quot; books, and enjoyed them all, but this story is even better.  The reader still gets a very clear picture of what life was like for these very early North Americans. The setting is totally remarkable, as in all the Gear novels.  I love the Ansazi culture and history, but this story is gripping and exciting in its own right since it is a very cleverly written mystery.  I certainly want to read the second book in this particular series.  I thought I had read enough about early North American history with the &quot;People&quot; series, but this book is totally fresh and different than the others, and I'm hooked again.  I especially liked the Canadian references - for example Tim Hortons.  I love their coffee too.	2000-11-30

The fact that it was a forensic mystery was, I thought, a bonus, since I love forensic mysteries.  Well, this book did disappoint me in all aspects.  There is very little New Orleans flavour to the book at all, and the forensic information was extremely minimal.  Not only that, but it wasn't even an exciting mystery.

Two southern belle sisters in their sixties, and oh so &quot;southern&quot;.  The characterization in this book is extremely good, and the two old gals are wonderful.  Unfortuantely, I didn't find the story line as good.  There are some pretty big holes in this plot, and the last part of the story, or the denouement made no sense, but I still enjoyed the book because of the characters, and because of the setting.  I  think I will give Ms.George another try.  It's definately fine for light reading.	2000-10-27

Melrose Plant is front and centre and he is turning out to be quite the detective.  He is one of the most  appealing characters I've read about for a long time.  Richard Jury's role  is reduced as compared to other books, but he comes in at a very crucial  time.  Macalvie is a wonderful character.  There is a danger that he may  eventually eclipse Jury.  I love Martha Grimes characterization, and her  comic relief is always wonderful.  She is one of the best mystery writers  of today, and is in league with the Dorothy Sayers and Agatha Christies of  the past in my mind.  No modern author can top her for eccentric  characters.	2000-04-14

I find this series is darker than the Pitt ones and every book has fine examples of Victorian  British courtroom drama.  I marvel at the way that Ms. Perry can portray  the Victorian mindset - the prejudices and the close-mindedness.  Improbable as it seems to us in our modern day world, being quick to  censure and to judge others against some impossible ideal was very  prevalent in late 1800 England.  There are a lot of plot twists and turns  in this book, and it has its usual surprise ending.

There is also more death, but she writes a terrific story.  Read this series. This is the first in the series of DCI Barnaby. He's enough of a curmudgeon to make this interesting, but there are certainly a lot more killings in this book than in most \\"cosies\\". The plot is good and it keeps you guessing. I look forward to reading more.  Barnaby gets started with one murder of an elderly teacher, but before the story is done there are other murders to contend with and the motive for the crimes, when it's discovered, will blow you away!	2000-03-14

This was a prime example of court intrigue from  the 17 century.  It's not really much different than intrigue and covert  operations nowadays, except the weapons and the costumes are much  different.

He has used a whole series of vignettes in this book  in order to depict a group of  people that has seen nothing but pain and suffering for all of their lives.  I am speaking of the Jews - God's chosen people. If anyone  wants a clearer  understanding of the whole Middle East question they should read this book.  It will explain a lot about the origin and the histories of the three main  religions - Judaism, Christianity and Islaam. The first stories in the book  of the ancient civilizations were thorough and revealing, but I found that  the vignettes of the  later conflicts in this tempestuous country quite  brief and the characterization not as descriptive. I would recommend that  if anyone wants a much clearer idea of the  Middle East question - since  the treaty of 1948, that they read Exodus by Leon Uris. Exodus explained  the problems and conflicts of modern Israel and enabled  me to really  understand the whole &quot;Middle East&quot; question.

I found the history of this state totally fascinating, and it  felt like I was there when Texas was just coming into being I felt like one  of those intrepid settlers that were responsible for making Texas a state.  I would like to visit this state sometime because it has a great history.  The story was good and the characters strong.  I especially liked the story  about the Alamo.  This almost mythic battle comes alive in the book.  America you have a lot to be proud of in this state.	2000-02-11

I really enjoyed this book and her writing is great because it holds your interest.  I heartily recommend this series for anybody who loves stories about Arthur and the life in Camelot.	2000-02-04

I am a big fan of Umberto Eco.  &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; is one of my all-time favourite books, so I was looking forward to reading this one.  Eco is an excellent writer.  His craftmanship cannot be beat, but this book  disappointed me.  The premise was a good one, but to me it just didn't seem  to get there.  I didn't grow to care about the characters, and there was  too much symbolism and &quot;off the wall&quot; ideas for my taste.  I read  the entire book because Eco is such a good author, and I thought I'd get  the point, but I never really did, and was very disappointed at the end.	2000-01-28

These books are really top notch.  I liked this one even better than the first (The Crystal Cave}.  I can  hardly wait to read the other two now.  For anyone who is as enthralled  with the Arthurain legend as I am, I highly recommend that they read this  series.  It's the best I've read so far.	2000-01-24

I really liked the first part because of the history of the Spanish Main, pirates and swashbucklers and big battles at sea.  That is my bias.  I love stories about the sea and especially from the  seventeen hundreds.  But as the time in the story got closer to the  twentieth century I found the book skipped around quite a bit.  It did  touch on the various islands and gave background on each but I searched for  and didn't find that common thread that is usually so apparent in  Michener's books.  In spite of that I would recommed this book.  It is  totally fascinating when you consider the history in this tranquil but  tumultous place.	2000-01-12

It helps because she writes about the Regina, Saskatchewan area and I actually was born around there.  Reading about streets that I had visited  and roads I had travelled was kind of fun.  Ms. Bowen is a good mystery  writer.  She has a strong story line and here characters are real.  Definitely worth a visit.	2000-01-12

The characters are good and finely drawn.  I really like Tempe Brennan.  The forensic information is wonderful. Hopefully, Ms Reichs will have a  more believable story line next time.  I will definitely read her again.	1999-12-21
2717246:US	50652563	RJSRMMXNICJ82	0812515560	134022346	People of the Lightning (The First North Americans series, Book 7)	Books	2	4	7	N	N	Ho Hum	Of all the books in this series which I have read up to this point, I found this book the hardest to get through.  It seemed disjointed and rather unbelievable.  We never really did find out why Cottonmouth wanted  Musselwhite so much that he did all that raiding and pillaging. I didn't  feel an affinity for any of the characters except for little Kelp.  Even  the Dreamers, who are usually the most intersting characters, were poorly  characterized.  I will read the remaining three books in the series, but  this is definitely the weakest so far.	1999-12-16

I did not find the characters  believable and I certainly didn't learn to care about them and what happened to them.  The court room segment was well  done, and that is why I gave the book two stars rather than one, but  personally I don't think John Grisham has a concern with these ladies  taking any of his readership away.	1999-12-08

The story line is very good, and it's exciting and holds the attention.  This is one of the best books I've read where the characters are  travelling.  Having two sets of people going to the same place made it  interesting.  This is my second favourite book so far in the  series,:&quot;People of the Fire&quot; being first.  This one is more like  a prehistoric romance than any of the others.	1999-12-02
