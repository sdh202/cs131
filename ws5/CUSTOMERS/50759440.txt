Rrossfire,Countdown,White House and Joshua's Hammer were excellent thrillers that I enjoyed reading. This book took up too much space trying to be a techno thriller in the mode of Tom Clancy. This detracted from the heroics of the good guy Kirk McGarvey. The villains in the story were also shifted to the sideline by the techno gimmickery. This book was also way too long. Because of the subject matter it wore on your patience to finish the book. This was definitely not on of David Hagberg's better efforts. I am glad he got back on track with his later  efforts. This was nearly bad.	2001-02-26

He also is able to display the vicious nature of Saddam Hussein who expends the lives of Iraqi like they are ragdolls. The focus of this story is a source behind enemy lines named Jerico. This source is being used to locate Saddam's secret nuclear bomb facility. The true identity of Jerico is stunning. The ending of the book is a true classical manner in ways to end a book.

I also was able to discover that Roger Gordian is not Jack Ryan. This is not vintage Clancy. The new book &quot;Bear and the Dragon&quot; is a much better book.

Raising a villain from the KGB to spearhead the plans of the evil billionaire was a  very good idea on Clancy's part. John Clark proved himself very competant  playing the lead role in this book. The Rainbow Six groups confrontations  with the Terrorist factions (including the IRA) made for exciting reading.  A very good book. I certainly hope he does a sequel.	2000-05-17

Alex Michaels is a very good central character. The netforce team is also very entertaining. One of the highlights of the book  in my eyes is the hired killer the Selkie. The Selkie's of the mob boss and  his mistress added to the book. Toni beating up on the Selkie was another  unexpected high point on the action scale. A very good book after you get  past the first 100 pages. The last 2 Net Forces have been total bombs.	2000-05-17

The idea of Saddam Hussein bringing in a professional killer to deal with one of the Allied leaders has a ring of reality to it. The final confrontation  with the result of Sean Dillon killing the billionaire was totally  exciting. This was one of the better Higgins books. Sean has turned into  one of Higgins most recently used characters. An excellent book.	2000-05-15

His expertise in computers certainly shows through. He has created another hero role with his star of the book. Another outstanding trait definitely comes  through with Pineiro's ability to create villains. The Cardinal and the  East Germans are without any question the Evil Empire. This book was  definitely hard to put down. Pineiro once again shows that he is a top of  the line author.	2000-05-15

The Colin Powell career made for very good reading. His early rise through the ranks of the Army was interesting. His service during the Carter Administration was also  very interesting. The part about the invasion of Panama was very newsworthy  because not much has ever been written about this military endeavor. His  leadership that he displayed during the Gulf War was very commendable. All  in all an outstanding book.	2000-05-15

The more of it that I read the better that it got. I enjoyed reading Strokk's (the hired gun) experiences in Afganistan. Here is another new villain from  Pineiro.The Mayan and their influence also added to the book. I was very  impressed with the tactics that the Mayan warrior used to handle Strokk and  his mercenaries. The finale of the book explaining the Mayan influence on  the millennium was also very captivating. Where I was at first skeptical of  this book I wound having an enjoyable read. A must buy.	2000-05-15

Revenge from the past for the atrocities committed during the Holocaust are driven home very professionally. The characters of Drew and Saul are used to further strengthen the story. Both  are drawn into the story by a unique usage of their past. After I read this  book I purchased &quot;Brotherhood of the Rose&quot;. as well as  &quot;Fraternity of the Stone&quot;. An outstanding book that will give you  a different outlook of the Holocaust as well as give you a new respect for  David Morrell.	2000-05-14

The  discovery of an Iranian mole on the White house Secret Service detail is a  unique approach in writing. The ending where the Ayatollah is punished is  outstanding. All in all a very good book.	2000-05-14

I found this book almost impossible to read. The characters were bad and the plot was terrible. I hope he starts taking his writing career a little  more serious. I pray that Bear and the Dragon were written by the old Tom  Clancy.	2000-05-13

I have read two of his books and have recently bought two more because he has proven to be an outstanding author. The subject matter of  &quot;Charm School&quot; will really make you wonder if a plot of this  magnitude could have really been pulled off with the Russians and the  Vietnamese working hand in hand.This book will certainly make you think.  Once again Nelson Demille has written a spellbinding book.	2000-05-13

The billionaire badguy certainly added to the story.  Another element of this story is the military and hired assasins that are  dispatched by Sinclaire. The good guy and heroine in this story certainly  add to the quality of this story. Pineiro will have to do a sequel to  Exposure. A quality book.	1999-12-13
