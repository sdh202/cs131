Books	5	6	7	N	N	For anyone who has even dreamed of setting up their own business	This is a terrific book for anyone who has ever considered or dreamed of going into business for himself (or herself).  Frankly, that is about everyone.  I suspect that you have thought about getting out of the 9-5 rat race or getting out of the cubicle farm, but have probably not made the leap into the unknown because too much is unknown and we have responsibilities that limit the risks we can afford to take.  This book is much like sitting around with an experienced and friendly uncle who takes you step by step through the things you absolutely must think through before you can seriously consider walking into the jungle of business with the hope of walking out rich.<br /><br />Steve Gottry bases this book on his own entrepreneurial efforts; some successful, others ended in bitter failure.  He not only shares the lessons he learned, but extends them into more general lessons about the broad considerations anyone in business must wrestle with.  He groups the twenty-three chapters in three broad parts.<br /><br />Part One is in two parts: The Small Business Life Cycle, and The Alternate Route.  The first part is for the person who has any kind of desire to be in business, but doesn't know what he would face.  It starts with the dreaming stage and helps you get to something more solid.  Of course, most of the dreams we have would make lousy businesses, but if you pan enough in the stream of ideas you might find a nugget of real gold.  Such is one path to business.  He then takes you through the planning and implementation stages.  Once you are in business you hope you will have to deal with growth.  You will also likely have to adapt and evolve your business, and at some point you will sell it, close it, or pass it on to heirs.<br /><br />The Alternate Route takes you through what you must consider if things go badly and you have to deal with creditors and possibly bankruptcy.  He also guides you through your second start-up.  Realistically, if you have what it takes to be on your own, you will never be happy working for someone else for the long term.  You might have to get a paycheck to get back on your feet, but you will eventually head out on your own once again.<br /><br />Part Two takes you through the process of building on your assets.  This is not as obvious as it might seem because it really is more than just your genius product or service.  In order to build a loyal customer base, to fight off competitors, to have a great employee team, and to be happy with your life, you really do need to think through these issues.<br /><br />Part Three takes you through those negatives in yourself and your company that can drag you down.  They include being distracted by being busy with non-core activities, a poisonous employee or culture, being sloppy, too much debt, getting on the wrong side of Uncle Sam, and letting your fears keep you from doing what must be done.  It is a painful look in the mirror, but to be successful look you must!<br /><br />One feature of this book I particularly like is the \\"Thinking It Through\\" section at the end of each chapter.  He lists the core questions the chapter raised and leaves spaces for you to write out your answers.  Actually, the answers will be too detailed to fit in the few lines he leaves you, but they are there to suggest - demand - that you take the time to not move forward until you have written out the answers to these questions.  Not that you will get them set down once and for all, but that you start the process of thinking in a serious way.  Writing it down forces you to organize your thoughts and helps you judge them critically.  So write.<br /><br />This is not a textbook and many of the issues he raises here will start you on your process.  You will need to study some of them more deeply or get professional guidance to supplement your own skills.  It reads easily and that is great, but make sure you take the time to seriously answer the questions he poses.  Even if you are already in business, you will likely pick up a helpful point or three.<br /><br />Handy book.en if you are already in business, you will likely pick up a helpful point or three.   <br /> <br />Handy book.	2005-10-13

Books	5	20	26	N	N	A concise book outlining what the West should do to resist the Islamicist threat	This book came to print just after the London bombings in their underground trains (The Tube), but soon Katrina and the destruction parts of New Orleans were all anyone was talking about.  In the short term this makes sense, but our long term well being depends more on what Mr. Blankley talks about in this concise and well written book.<br /><br />The author opens the book with a nightmare scenario of European capitulation to rising Muslim political power and granting their demand that they be subject to their own courts based on Muslim law, and the censoring of public art that Muslims find offensive.  America chooses in favor of rejecting similar demands in America despite the pandering of a Republican candidate who is rejected at the polls.  Lest you think this is all fantasy stuff, you not only have the bombings in London and Madrid and the murder of Theo Van Gogh, but you have German state schools being mandated to teach Muslims a Muslim specific curriculum.  Here is a quote from a letter a teacher in one such school received, \\"Germany is an Islamic country.  Islam is in the home, in schools.  Germans will be outnumbered.  We [Muslims] will say what we want.  We'll live how we want.  It's outrageous that Germans demand we speak their language.  Our children will have our language, our laws, our culture.\\"  This is not assimilation or working and playing well with others.<br /><br />However, Blankley does not see the real problem being Islam or even the Islamofacists (or whatever you want to call the extremists).  He faults the West for being weak enough to invite the problem and for failing to deal with it properly in the beginning.  He compares the way FDR and Churchill dealt with foreign threats in the Second World War versus what our hyper commitment to multi-culturalism and individual freedoms puts in greater jeopardy.  The history lesson is quite well done and is much more nuanced than the knee-jerk critics of this book would have you believe.<br /><br />I also appreciate the way the author notes the population problem that Europe's various welfare states have created for them and why the immigration programs were begun to pay for those programs with low-end workers.  However, the assimilation has not worked out as expected (note the letter quoted above), and the growing Muslim populations (now over 10% in France) do have real political impact on policies and foreign affairs.<br /><br />Blankley also faults President Bush for not declaring war properly.  He, the author feels, should have declared war on the Islamicists and put the country on a more serious wartime footing.  After giving us a solid 160-page foundation for his program, Blankley urges us to move forward with these steps:<br /><br />-Declare War<br />-Use Ethnic Profiling<br />-Secure Our Borders<br />-Adopt National Identification Cards<br />-Chart Progress<br />-Perform Fact Based Analysis (rather than using political sensibilities to measure)<br />-Take advantage of Globalization<br />-Strengthen our Alliance with Europe<br />-Win the European Culture War<br /><br />He then sums up with why we in the West must have a common defense and why the Islamicist threat is as serious as that Nazi threat was in 1939 - 45.  His postscript notes the sacrifice our country made of 30,000 lives to hold the Philippines in order to stall the Japanese advance for five months while we prepared elsewhere for the larger fight.  He notes that we are wasting time today and wonders what the costs will be in the future for such lost time.<br /><br />It is important to remember that Blankley writes this book more about the problems with the West and its current weakness than going after Islam, although he does note the responsibility of the moderates to remove the extremist elements.  His main point is that if the West were strong enough in its true cultural roots and history that the Islamicist movement would be largely irrelevant.<br /><br />I think this is a very interestingbook.  You can decide for yourself once you read it, and I hope you do.	2005-10-11

This book does a fine job in showing us how companies such as McDonalds, Nike, Kodak, DeBeers, and others have learned these lessons to their benefit.<br /><br />McDonalds used to ignore women while focusing on children and men.  By listening to women and letting women help design their new salads, they have not only increases sales, but increased the dollars per order as well.  Kodak, went back to its roots and created products for digital photography that were easy to use and empowered women who weren't interested in becoming technical experts to take and print great pictures.  Nike opened a huge new market by creating products specifically for women rather than simply cutting down men's products.  Women want and need different equipment and fashion.  DeBeers realized that their traditional market of selling to men to buy for women was cutting them out of the market of single women who could buy diamonds for themselves.<br /><br />This is a book of eye opening case studies and contains lessons for every business.  There may be things to bemoan about the course our current culture is taking, but businesses have to function and sell in the present.  This book can help you see what others have found and maybe help you think through possible new directions for your own company and its products and services.	2005-10-10

And that is surely a story that is worth knowing and remembering, as are the landings at Utah, Gold, Juno, and Sword.  The problem is that the landing becomes the shorthand for the entire campaign in France, as if once the troops were off the beaches the fierce fighting was over and all that was left was the dash to Berlin.  In reality, Hitler threw everything he could at these forces with the intent of pushing them back into the sea.  He understood that once a breakout occurred, it would be all but impossible to stop their advance towards Berlin.  Montgomery expected the Nazi forces to pull back across the Seine and reform their defenses there.  Instead, Hitler threw most of the available Nazi forces at the British and Canadian positions in what became a fierce stalemate.  Eisenhower, putting perspective on this fighting in the Caen sector said, \\"ten feet gained on the Caen sector was equivalent to a mile elsewhere.\\" (Pg 311)<br /><br />There is debate whether Montgomery intended his troops to be in an awful and bloody stalemate while only telling his forces they were there to break through the Nazi line, or whether he really hoped for a breakout that never materialized.  In either case, the fierce fighting by these British and Canadian forces absorbed so much of the Nazi effort that it allowed Patton and his fabulous 3rd Army to break out and perform his breakthrough further down the line of the fighting like a running back going around the crush of the lines to an open field.<br /><br />The author of this amazing book, George G. Blackburn, was there as a young artillery officer during this fighting as part of an artillery regiment that moved, set-up, and fired 25 pounder cannon to support the ground forces.  Do not think for a moment that this was not harrowing and exhausting duty.  The enemy desperately wanted these guns disabled and was relentless in trying to destroy these men and their equipment.  As on officer, he also describes in vivid detail his first turn as a FOO (Forward Observation Officer).  These are the brave men who go to the front and direct the fire of the canon onto the targets.  The casualty rate for this duty is almost total and the bravery of some of these officers in standing out in the open directing tank fire onto targets is beyond understanding.<br /><br />While it is certainly true that those of us who have never been in combat can never know what it is like, particularly in the kind of ferocious fighting and massed conflict documented in this book, but that argument is also a truism.  Books are written to convey knowledge to another and are valuable because they allow us to know things other than those we directly experience.  This book is so forcefully written with descriptions that are so immediate and fearsome, that it will likely affect your dreams.  I know it did mine.<br /><br />Also, movies are a powerful medium, but I know of none that can convey the random death, extreme violence, comprehensive exhaustion, stench, and feculence as vividly as this book.  Blackburn allows us to understand the exhaustion of moving tons of earth, rock, and mud to create the pits for the guns, moving more tons of ammunition getting it into pits, the duty of firing the guns around the clock, and then finding your own slit trench (foxhole) to keep yourself alive during those brief moments of rest all the while hoping one of the incoming shells isn't headed for you.<br />When the high speed shells from the Nazi 88s bang into camp and lives are spared because of Czech's built duds to hurt the Nazi effort, we feel the strange exhilaration at being so randomly intact, and yet there is constant fear that the next round coming in might be live and make you dead.  The randomness of trying to take shelter and having fragments destroy something right next to you and yet you are spared is constantly disorienting, yet you stay on your tasks.  Blackburn describes how once he found one tiny fragment of shrapnel in his backpack when he went for a pair of his socks and found only cut up ball of thread, such was the spin velocity and razor edge of the fragment.<br /><br />Then there is the demoralization of moving into an area where you have to dig pits for the guns and yourselves and find chalk just below the surface.  Hours of work with a pickaxe remove only a foot of rock.  Yet the need to protect the guns, the ammo, and yourselves keeps everyone hacking down into chalk.  There were also the two bombings behind the front by Allied Forces costing hundreds of lives and much needed equipment.  First it was the US and then, a couple of weeks later, the RAF.  It was a combination of errors in navigation and, in the second case, a misunderstanding of the signal to use to mark the front of the line.<br /><br />Yet, there is tremendous comradeship.  Blackburn describes how it works more effectively than I have ever heard.  Because of all the casualties, there is a constant stream of replacement soldiers and officers.  Yet, men will risk their lives to care for men they do not know.  They will huddle ever more closely in an impossibly crowded trench to give a new guy at the entrance a few more inches to get him out of the rain and a bit more shelter from enemy fire.<br /><br />The events covered in this book are the few weeks between July 1 and September 5, 1944.  This is a short time in civilian life, but through this book you will experience events that make this seem like an eternity.  The horror of all the rotting flesh, human and farm animals, the dysentery, the artillery that is fired so frequently it glows red in the night, and the inhuman noise will almost wear you out as your read the book.<br /><br />Mr. Blackburn recounts not only his own experiences (in the second person), but provides other stories and background through interviews with other people and official documents and reliable histories.  It is a terrific book because it provides us insight into a part of the Second World War our shorthand way of remembering past events does not provide.  For Americans, it is also wonderful to read about the sacrifices our neighbors to the North made to help our forces break out towards Berlin.  And I found the efforts of the artillerymen, supposedly back of the fighting, positively heroic.  Do yourself a favor and experience this book.  You will feel gratitude towards a generation that is leaving us all too rapidly and understand more what our armed forces are today providing for us all over the world.bes how once he found one tiny fragment of shrapnel in his backpack when he went for a pair of his socks and found only cut up ball of thread, such was the spin velocity and razor edge of the fragment.

As in our time, the purposes have been to raise revenue for the government, but they were also used for other purposes.  They were used to keep a given people in servitude to another, to shape social policy, to control markets, and so on.<br /><br />The title of the book notes that taxes can be used for good and for evil.  When used judiciously, the public can benefit from our shared contribution to certain good projects.  What those are depends on what a given society values, and that is why democratically elected governments and therefore democratically controlled taxation are of real benefit.  Unfortunately, we are moving away from such taxes to certain kinds of indirect fees and countless other hidden taxes.  These have always ended up badly for a society, as they likely will for us.<br /><br />However, being a republic, if we become educated about these things and demand our government sweep things clean, we can force it done.  We should become more educated about these things and exert more control over government expenditures and on the way revenues are raised to cover them.<br /><br />This is not a perfect book.  Some of the anecdotes are told a bit glibly and others are shaded a bit to make a point.  However, you will get the idea.  Just don't run out and think that what you read here is settled historical fact.  There are often subtleties that are left out in order to make a stronger point.  Even with this caveat, this is still a useful book for everyone to read.	2005-09-26

He had a real gift for the music in words.  At first it seems that they should all be set to music, but as you hear them and let them play in your mind, you realize they are already their own setting.  Some of his poems have been set to music, but none improved.<br /><br />While I praise his real and powerful gifts, I also want to note that there is a certain adolescence in his themes of dying and death that, for me, diminish his greatness.  However, it has and continues to attract the young who, in the abundance of everthing that is youth, think it mature and so, so, sophisticated to pine for death.  For example in his own epitaph, he is upset with the fact that he has to die and blames his mother for bringing him into a world where his fate is to feed worms.  Please!  This from a man who basically drank himself to death at a sadly early age (not tragically - drinking yourself to death is hardly tragic, it is stupid).<br /><br />For me, his early poem \\"Woman on Tapestry\\" is powerfully beautiful and demonstrates his gifts and strengths.  Or take a look at the vitality and rhythm of \\"The Countryman's Return\\" (It opens: \\"Embracing Low-falutin' London (said the odd man in a country-pot, his hutch in the fields, by a mother-like henrun)\\".  That's pretty good stuff.<br /><br />The CD with Dylan Thomas' voice is a nice addition because the music is all the more obvious.	2005-09-26

It begins with not only the traditional telling of the origins of Biblical Israel, it does not shy away with the intellectual problematics of that story.  However, it is not as dismissive of the ancient stories as are most modern critics.<br /><br />Only about one third of the book deals with biblical times at all, and much of that is well within historical times in the sense that we have contemporary records from other sources.  The bulk of the book deals with the Jewish people in other settings, how their fortunes ebbed and flowed, and how they finally won emancipation in Europe.<br /><br />There is also a telling of the rise of the Zionist movement, the Holocaust, and the founding of modern Israel.  Although the later is very short and does not deal with the latest developments because the book is now twenty years old.<br /><br />It reads quite well.  You need not let its thousand page length hold you back because it reads more like a novel than a dry and dusty history.  If you take your time reading it you will have more time to think about what you are reading and it will stick with you permanently.  If you dash through it, all this great information will evaporate like the morning dew.	2005-09-26

Prahalad's \\"The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid\\" identified the great market opportunity in provided much needed goods and services to the vast populations in the world's undeveloped areas.  He provided case studies of companies profitably helping to lift these populations through revolutionary approaches to delivering medical products, consumer goods, personal hygiene products, and more.<br /><br />This very interesting book by Vijay Mahajan and Kamini Banga builds on that ground breaking book by identifying important market considerations and strategies for designing products and methods for developing the market of the bottom 86% of the world's population (hence the title).  The author's believe that the companies that find ways to market profitably to these billions of people will unleash a new period of global economic growth.<br /><br />The book begins with the argument for paying attention to this vast population rather than staying focused solely on the wealthiest 14% of the world's population.  They also demonstrate that there are segmentations within these billions of people.  They are not uniformly poor.  In fact, there is a huge number of middle class people in these areas of the world.<br /><br />The authors make the case that the successful companies won't be the ones who take goods designed for the infrastructures of the developed countries, but will be those who provide goods and services that fit within and add to the present infrastructure in these less developed and undeveloped areas.  They provide interesting examples with cell phones that help Muslims know when it is time to pray and the direction of Mecca as well as vehicles based on bullock carts rather than sleek sedans.<br /><br />The interactions between the developed and less developed countries also create opportunities.  It is important to learn about these flows and identify ways of benefiting through these opportunities.  I also enjoyed their discussion of the problems of branding in these markets and the need of connecting brands to the market rather than simply rolling in a global brand that may actually have negative connotations.<br /><br />These countries also have a young population, so the authors urge us to think young, to think in terms of smaller and more frequent purchases, and the importance of bringing your own infrastructure in many areas of the world.  They also talk about exporting from the less developed world to the developed world.<br /><br />Depending on your point of view, you can find this book hopeful or threatening.  I think the more realistic position is to understand that there are billions of people who yearn for better lives and will work hard to achieve them.  It is an important human endeavor to aid them in their efforts.  It is smart to help them help themselves in ways that also provide opportunities for your own betterment and profit.oblems of branding in these markets and the need of connecting brands to the market rather than simply rolling in a global brand that may actually have negative connotations.  <br /> <br />These countries also have a young population, so the authors urge us to think young, to think in terms of smaller and more frequent purchases, and the importance of bringing your own infrastructure in many areas of the world.

Senate Judiciary Committee--And Won	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Important and instructive story on the sad state of our nomination process for Federal Judges	While a number of fine books are available on the over reach of our judiciary that focus on their outrageous rulings, this most interesting book shows us how our broken process for getting potential federal judges through the nomination process demonstrates the rottenness of our present politics.  The title, \\"The Borking Rebellion\\" is a play on another Pennsylvania uprising during Washington's Presidency known as \\"The Whiskey Rebellion\\".  This book tells the story of getting Brooks Smith through the nomination gauntlet to be seated as a Federal Appeals Court judge for western Pennsylvania.<br /><br />It uses the name of Judge Robert Bork in the title because the verb to Bork is now in some dictionaries.  It refers to the process of character assassination that was used by Senator Ted Kennedy, NOW, and others to stall the process, smear with false accusations, rumor, and misrepresentation, and then to try to kill the nomination by keeping it from a vote by the whole Senate, if possible.  Judge Brooks Smith was nominated to the appeals court for the western portion of Pennsylvania at a time when there was a critical shortage of seated judges in that district.  Immediately, anonymous sourced began posting rumors about him on the web.  Public statements were made about his life and career that were false, but picked up by those who felt it in their interests to thwart his being seated.<br /><br />Since Judge Smith was supported strongly by Senator Rick Santorum, certain liberal Senators such as Senator Pat Leahy and Senator Joe Biden participated in the Washington D.C. based campaign to, well, Bork Judge Smith.  The machine was moving against Smith quite smoothly in Washington, but was causing an across the political spectrum uproar in Pennsylvania.  There were a number of women who were also liberals, Democrats, and lawyers who had argued in front of Judge Smith that were in favor of his being appointed to the seat for which President Bush hand nominated him.  They joined the group that became known as the Phalanx that fought against the Borking process and ultimately prevailed.<br /><br />While important work was done by everyone in the Phalanx, it was the liberals, Amy Greer, Maureen Kelly, and Lynette Norton who, along with Senator Arlen Specter, were able to make the charges against Smith untenable.  Eventually, even Senator Biden came around and supported Smith.<br /><br />This is an entertaining read.  The anecdotes tell the story effectively.  I found the story quite disturbing because of what it says about the politicization of our Judiciary.  Why is this so?  Because our elected representatives have essentially abdicated the hard work of fighting out controversial legislation.  They are so focused on re-election that all the hard decisions are fobbed off on blue-ribbon commissions, regulatory agencies, and even the judiciary.  Our representatives know their re-election depends more on how many truckloads of money they can bring back to the district or state than on their standing up for a difficult political position.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the judiciary is set up in a way that political fighting is very difficult against once you are nominated and our system is poorly designed to fight off the work of judges who legislate from the bench.  Where this will end, I have no idea.  However, you can become better informed by reading this most instructive story.ey joined the group that became known as the Phalanx that fought against the Borking process and ultimately prevailed. <br /> <br />While important work was done by everyone in the Phalanx, it was the liberals, Amy Greer, Maureen Kelly, and Lynette Norton who, along with Senator Arlen Specter, were able to make the charges against Smith untenable.

Next is a chapter on basic knots, bends, and hitches and tells you what you will need to tie these twenty basic knots.  The rest of the book provides wonderfully photographed and written instructions on more than two hundred knots.  They are grouped into bends, hitches, knots, bindings, and loops.  A final chapter shows you how to use what you have learned to make mats, plaits, rings, clings, and other things.  There is also a glossary and an index.  There is another page of vendors and other organizations that can help you with your new hobby.<br /><br />The book also supplies a legend with each knot that indicates where it can be most useful.  These are for Angling / Fishing, Boating / Sailing, Caving / Climbing, General Purpose, and Outdoor Pursuits.<br /><br />This is an inexpensive hobby and will provide you with skills that can come in surprisingly handy in any number of circumstances.<br /><br />Have fun!	2005-09-21

They focus on the value of the then new edition of the LDS scriptures and the value of the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible for Latter-day Saints.  There first paper is by Elder Bruce R. McConkie on \\"The Doctrinal Restoration\\".  He discusses the need for a restoration, what it is that needs to be restored, how it is being restored, and what we need to do to participate in the restoration.<br /><br />The various papers discuss aspects of the Joseph Smith Translation in the Old and New Testaments and are all quite interesting.  However, I particularly liked Robert Cloward's paper on the Sermon on the Mount.  He compares the differences in the Sermon in the JST and the Book of Mormon with the standard King James Bible and demonstrates what is clarified and why these are significant.<br /><br />Once you read these papers, it will become even more clear why the JST is important and you will find yourself reading the footnoted passages and those longer passages in the back even more closely and with more understanding.  At least that is what I have experienced.	2005-09-21

Here he expresses his faith, insights, and commitment to trusting the Lord and taking his covenants most seriously.  He hammers home again and again that we receive everything from the Lord and that we are blind to many of the blessings we have all around us.  We refuse to take them because we are after the things of this world and are of no worth, though we have been warned to turn away from them.<br /><br />Dr. Nibley implores us to begin living the Law of Consecration.  He gives us no quarter.  We know what it means, we know how to do it, and we know the covenants we have made.  We also know the promises the Lord has made to us concerning this Law.  I don't know about you, but I find this beyond what I can do understand or do in my current circumstances.  Yet, I feel the need to ponder what the author is telling me and to move towards this principle of life.<br /><br />These are essays and papers that were written since the 1970s.  Many are published here for the first time (unless you read them as papers from FARMS).  As I say, these are very challenging writings.  Not because they are hard to understand, but because they are challenging in very serious ways.  Dr. Nibley takes the gospel very seriously and literally.  He points out to us that we have too often inverted values to our detriment.  He deplores the way education has changed and that learning and thinking have been replaced by feeling and degree accumulation.<br /><br />The last few essays in the book are among the most directly challenging to our present way of life.  His discussion of Aristotle's notion of goods of first and second intent is wide-ranging and quite informative.  The last essay on the atonement is quite beautiful and insightful.  I think my favorite essay is his funeral address for one of his friends.<br /><br />Nibley's plain speaking about his faith in the atonement and the challenge it presents us for our lives here on earth and in eternity is inspiring.  The writings here bear careful reading and re-reading and then meditation.  You will have to change your life if you take them seriously.  And that is unsettling and that is what we ask teachers to do: to shake up our lives.<br /><br />Dr. Nibley continues his great teaching.iring.

Each chapter discusses a different aspect of Celtic civilization and each is amply illustrated.  There are more than three illustrations in the book with more than fifty in color.<br /><br />I particularly like the discussion of various artifacts and what we learn by teasing out this or that detail from close examination.  It is not only interesting to note what scientists find, but where they find it so we get a picture of where the Celts were and how their civilization changed over time and in various places.<br /><br />This is a beautiful book to leaf through and enjoy for the beauty of the artifacts.  Of course, reading the text will add to your enjoyment.  However, if you are not already familiar with the scope of Celtic artistry, you will be stunned at the great artistry exhibited in so many of their artifacts and earthworks.<br /><br />Add this to your history shelf!	2005-09-20

I guess it sells better than a title saying what it truly is: \\"Selected Readings in Non-canon Scripture\\".  There are quite a number of selections here, but most are excerpts and all are selections.  This is not an alternative set of scripture that is accepted by anybody.<br /><br />The book opens with a number of very interesting writings on the creation.  Most are Gnostic, but there are also a few from the Kabbalah. Then there are histories from the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Jewish Pseudepigrapha.  Psalms and Odes follow including selections from the Dead Sea Scrolls, Gnostic writings, and even Manichean Gnostic.  There are also various kinds of gospels, infancy gospels, acts of the apostles, apocalypses, and mystical texts.  There is a lot here.  None of it is essential and might actually do harm to someone not well grounded in their faith in canonized scripture.<br /><br />That being said, this stuff is interesting to read.  Just remember that it is not a coordinated set of texts with a single purpose in mind.  The texts are often contradictory and strange.  Sometimes it is obvious why it is not canonized scripture, at other times it is not very clear why it is outside the canon. The editor provides some explanatory material, but don't get too caught up in the notion that this is stuff that was left out but should have been included but for the biases of the early Church fathers.<br /><br />So, if you are interested in this stuff, this can be a good source book.  It is not meant to be read front to back or even all the way through.  If you want to study scripture, beware of this material.	2005-09-20

The style is not hard to read, but its lack of footnotes will frustrate the more serious student of the subject.  That being said this book will surprise many people for whom this period is a blank slate on the wall under the heading \\"The Dark Ages\\".  It turns out they were not so dark, as bleak, or as uniform as the popular notion would have it.  They did develop technologies and their society was shaped by their development.  They just don't look like innovations to us.<br /><br />Professor Cantor takes us through the changes in their society, their revolutions, the inevitable Crusades, and then the foundations of the Renaissance.  Yes, the Roman Catholic Church had a great deal of power during this period, but it was far from the only world power and was itself influenced by the wars and politics of those centuries.<br /><br />The book has a couple of pages of movies that deal with this period along with the author's interesting comments.  There is also and index.  The book also has a list for further reading, which is very helpful.  Too bad there are no footnotes.  I know how much editors of popular books hate them because they drive down sales.  However, this really is not a glib popular history.  It is for the general reader, yes, but a person sitting down to read about this period is already taking a serious intellectual step, why not help him or her get to other source material for the points the author makes.	2005-09-20
46984:US	53052943	R29R21NTOSHPZH	0060875410	122518901	The FairTax Book	Books	5	2	3	N	N	A proposal to remove inefficiencies and increase competitiveness and fairness in our federal tax law	While there are several books currently available proposing tax reform, they all agree on one thing:  our current federal tax system is a broken monstrosity.  It is so long and complex that no one can say that any given computation of even a moderately complex tax liability is correct because no two experts can agree on how it should be done.  Worse, the law is riddled with one-off exceptions for any business with political connections.  Not only do these unique laws provide distortions in marketplace competition, they underscore the kind of political dealing that undermines the faith of so many in our government's integrity.  These special favors for political friends encourage others to engage in other kinds of political corruption and the rot simply grows.  Add to this the way the IRS invades and bullies citizens, and there is all the more reason to junk the current system.<br /><br />The tax law is also riddled with attempts at social engineering.  A great deal of the money the federal government takes in is used to shape behavior.  The hammer of withholding federal money if you fail to adopt one of their policies has changed society over the past several decades and often not for the better.  It makes our economy less efficient and encourages people to game the system and end up ever more dependent on the government larder.<br /><br />This book proposes doing away with all income taxes and all other federal payroll withholding and replacing it with a tax on all retail purchases of new goods and services.  They rightly point out that our current prices are full of hidden taxes and inefficiencies (for example, the cost of computing these taxes) that make us less competitive at home and especially abroad.  They believe that removing theses inefficiencies will roughly offset their tax.  So, when you realize that you get your same paycheck with no withholding, it is pretty much a free lunch.  Better yet, our exported goods will not be charged this tax, so they are much more competitive because the current built-in taxes and their associated costs are removed.<br /><br />The social coercion aspects of our current taxes are also removed, as are its disincentives for saving your money.  The authors believe that their Fair Tax will encourage the formation of savings, make Social Security and Medicare safe for future generations, and usher in a new era of prosperity.  Sounds great on paper!  You have to decide for yourself if you buy into their program.  Your buying in is essential because only a popular campaign pushing for the implementation of this revolutionary tax program will make it happen.  Every current lobbying group, tax accounting firm (and professional organization), and Congressman will oppose it for their own selfish reasons.  It simply is not in their interest to give up their power over you or their clients.  So, this will never happen on its own.<br /><br />It is a short book and answers most of the questions you will have about this program.  However, I am still not sure how they will go about repealing the amendment authorizing the income tax.  Until they do that, I am unsure how we would avoid ending up with Congress implementing both this tax AND an income tax although the authors state that abolishing the income tax once and for all is part of this program.  The hunger in Congress for our money knows no limit.  Your representatives are so inebriated by their power they actually believe that you keeping more of your own money is a tax expense on their part!<br /><br />Another important issue that is not seriously handled in the book is how the market for wages would adjust if there were no withholding.  The authors assume you would keep every penny and maybe even get that portion the employer now contributes to Social Security on your behalf (in itself an illusion - it is your pay).  I am not so sure.  Yes, your current salary was set in a competitive market, but if everyone is now so much better off because of efficiencies, wouldn't certain new hires be willing to work for less?  After all, the stock price of the last share sold sets the price for the valuation of all shares (at least for an instant).  So, it may be that there would be salary efficiencies gained as well and everyone will end up earning somewhat less over time and the FairTax would not be the free lunch the author's claim.  Certainly, this is likely to be a huge wedge its critics will use against it.<br /><br />This is an interesting book that deserves to be widely read and its merits debated along with the other proposals currently being discussed.  However, don't be fooled.  Those in power will try to kill all of them by pitting the supporters of the various proposals against each other and thereby confusing the public.  Their real goal is to keep things under their control.  They prefer things as they are and real reform is not something they want.  Just look at how none of them are moving to remove or reform the Alternative Minimum Tax that affects millions of relatively average taxpayers rather than the few millionaires it was originally created for.<br /><br />My own belief is that tax reform that removes power from Washington, is least susceptible to manipulation, and makes they payment of the tax most explicit to the payer is the best.  However, the real problem is the spending level of the federal government.  Arguing about taxes is simply arguing over how the bill should be split after the banquet.

You don't need to know anything at all about opera to find this book most enjoyable.  As you read the articles and examine the pictures you will begin to see why grand opera is one of the greatest of the art forms.  It involves music, drama (and comedy). Instrumental music and singing, dancing, costumes (fashion), painting for those glorious sets, stagecraft, and much more.  Millions love opera, and while many of us live or used to live in areas without an opera company or we can't afford the tickets (opera is expensive to produce), this book can bring to life affordable audio recordings of the singing and music.<br /><br />The authors have provided us articles on 124 composers and 338 operas.  The book is organized alphabetically by composer and then chronologically within the composer's life.  The major composers have longer articles about their lives.  The articles on the operas include not only the facts of the first performance, but also a brief synopsis of the story of the opera.  The articles often provide information about major performances of the work.  And the book is full or wonderful pictures of the composers, the operas in their various performances, set designs, the great stars over the centuries, an the opera houses.  A few musical examples of great moments in the opera are often included.<br /><br />This book is wonderfully informative and very entertaining.  Given how inexpensively this book can be purchased used, I don't see why anyone would want to be without it.	2005-09-17

For those of us who care about golf and its major championships it is very nice to have this one for the final major of each season.  This book provides a solid history of the tournament since it was first conducted in 1916.  From its inception through 1957 it was a grueling match play event that at times required the victor to play more than 200 holes in five days!  This book does a great job in telling us about the formation of the PGA and the championship tournament.  We also learn about the Wanamaker Trophy, who Wanamaker was, and the importance of his early support to the tournament.<br /><br />The book tells us about the interesting characters that have won the championship over the decades, when it was not held because of war, the issue of race in the tournament, and the eventual inclusion of African-American and other minorities in the championship. The book rightly focuses more attention on those champions who were multiple winners.  Therefore the book gives us wonderful portraits of Walter Hagen, who won five times and was one of the original members of the PGA, and Jack Nicklaus, who also won this tournament five times and provides the foreword for this book.<br /><br />There are many pages of fabulous pictures of the champions we know and love, but many more on past champions we should get to know.  There are also pictures of the courses, programs, fans, and equipment.  It is quite interesting to see how things have changed over the years and how surprising things can sometimes be.  Who can forget John Daly driving all night and starting the 1991 PGA Championship without even a warm-up round and then going on to win the tournament.  What you might not know is that one of the fans was killed during the event on the first day.  John Daly gave the family $30,000 for an endowment for his daughters' education.<br /><br />The book is full of great stories, great information, and wonderful images.  It concludes with a list of all the champions, their score, the runner-up, the course, its yardage, the dates and total purse (you will be shocked at how little the pros won even twenty-five years ago).<br /><br />Great gift for your golf-addicted friends.the champions, their score, the runner-up, the course, its yardage, the dates and total purse (you will be shocked at how little the pros won even twenty-five years ago).<br /><br />Great gift for your golf-addicted friends.	2005-09-17

The ridicule of the Book of Mormon began before it was even published.  Its critics have howled about various things in the book that have been perceived as flaws by one generation or another.  It is interesting how the criticism have changed since 1830.  To the first critics it seemed that there was too much common vernacular in the book (Jonathanisms).  They didn't like a man claiming to talk with God face to face (many still don't).  They found many of the claims about how these ancient inhabitants of the Americas lived.<br /><br />This wonderful book by Hugh Nibley discusses many of the criticisms of the Book of Mormon by its critics over the decades and how discoveries subsequent to the publishing of the book make life harder for the critics.  Remember, if the book is a fake, nothing in reality should tend to confirm the book.  Reality should continue to move away from the claims of the book rather than the other way around.<br /><br />As always, Nibley relies more on connecting any physical evidences to spiritual truths.  For Nibley, proving the book to unbelievers is never important because they can never be convinced.  Instead, he tries to help believers connect more vividly to the spiritual purposes of the Book of Mormon.<br /><br />There are many pictures and the writing is delightful and witty.	2005-09-12

In 1962 they were published as we have here with two concluding chapters.  These lectures all discuss the nature of the prophetic calling versus what the world would praise as leaders.  Nibley hammers home again and again that a prophet has nothing to do with earning the world's praise nor is he required to appeal to us.  It is our duty to hear God's voice and get ourselves in line with what God would have us do.  To do this we need to hear the Spirit who will confirm to us the words we hear from the prophet.<br /><br />It is always interesting to me that we continue to turn to our own ways even after having the world's folly confirmed to us again and again.  Yet, to the world the message of any prophet is foreign and strange to the point of being ridiculous.  No wonder they mock and point.  It is our job to ignore the world and stay focused on the words of life.<br /><br />This book can help make following true prophets much easier with greater understanding, confidence, and focus.  It does read as a series of talks rather than a treatise that builds up a single argument.  Instead, each chapter can be read separately.  You might gain by reading one chapter each day for a month and a day and meditate on each one for that day.	2005-09-12

This is a collection of writings responding to anti-Mormon literature ranging from Fawn McKay Brodies \\"No Man Knows My History\\", to the apostate critics of the early church, to the writings of one Brigham Young's wives (divorced wife).  Nibley's writing is sharp, is often quite funny, and some critics have found it a bit harsh.  I found it all delightful.<br /><br />Again, the audience Nibley is writing for is not unbelievers.  He is not interested in trying to win over people who have every intention of never being won over.  Instead, he is providing assurance and help for those who have been hit over the head again and again that their faith and belief is foolish.  Nibley demonstrates that their faith makes a great deal of sense.  He helps us see the inherent contradictions within the arguments of various critics and how they end up recycling the same false stories again and again.  What is quite interesting is that these critics all cite each other hoping to gain credibility by these citations.  However, the stories are falsehoods based upon little more than rumor and malice.<br /><br />This is a big book and while it is a great deal of fun, I don't think it is Nibley's most important work.  However, if you find yourself becoming confused by writings critical of Joseph Smith and the church, here is a good place to go to help you find solid ground.	2005-09-12

It is a wonderful book and helps anyone wishing to study the Book of Mormon to get a good perspective on what the book has to offer and how to approach it.  This is not a text providing a narrative study of the Book of Mormon.  Nor is it a book that tries to provide evidences of its truth.<br /><br />Instead, Nibley writes for people who already have a testimony of its truth and provides an approach to help us deal with Lehi and his descendants as real people.  He helps us see them in real and human settings rather than as stock characters in a set piece drama.  We are taught about life in the desert.  We explore what wilderness means.  Nibley even talks about the implications of the Dead Sea Scrolls, which were fairly new in the 1950s, and how they enrich the message of the Book of Mormon.<br /><br />The author also talks about the fallen societies of the Book of Mormon and they ways in which trying to judge this gift and revelation from God by human standards of criticism is a dangerous path to follow.  There is also a wonderful appendix about the way archaeological studies can mislead as much as they can inform and to warn the unwary.  The book also has many helpful notes and an index.<br /><br />Very much worth studying and re-reading.	2005-09-12

Using the name as a shortcut for the Holocaust, for genocide, mass murder, poison gas, crematoria, Nazi SS terror troops, and more actually cheats us.  This rather small book takes on the big task of telling in a very straightforward way how Auschwitz came to be, what happened there during the Second World War, and its aftermath.<br /><br />Auschwitz is the name the Germans applied to a Polish town as they moved to the East to provide \\"Living Space\\" and a buffer against the Soviets.  At first they moved the Poles out of the town to other prison camps and then brought them back and killed thousands.  IG Farben decided it could use the slave labor such camps could provide and so a huge factory was built.  But the camp was too far away for malnourished prisoners to travel each day.  They had hoped these prisoners would be at least half as effective as a healthy German.  The prisoners, starved, beaten, and traumatized, were only about 20% as effective.  So, a camp was built next to the plant.<br /><br />Soviet Prisoners of War by the thousands were also brought to an Auschwitz camp to be slaves, they ended up being useless for that purpose.  More than 10,000 of them were killed as well.  When the war effort began going badly the camps moved into extermination and a huge third camp was begun with enough capacity to burn more than 4,500 bodies per day.  They were never all in service at the same time, but what did exist was so overburdened with use that they became damaged and required repair.  Bodies were burned in open trenches during the repairs.<br /><br />The author teaches us that the 4 million killed in Auschwitz was based by the Soviets on theoretical crematoria capacity.  Scholars studying the subject now believe that between 1.1 and 1.5 million were killed there in various ways.  There was the Zyklon B and cremation, but there was also shooting, starvation, disease, beating, medical experimentation, and even doctors injecting phenol directly into prisoners' hearts.  We are shown how this easily fits in with the number of 6 million Jews killed during the war.  In the beginning only about half of those killed were Jews, by the frantic last days it was almost all Jews.<br /><br />The book also takes us through the trials related to Auschwitz (not all the war crimes trials) and what was uncovered and how punishment was meted out and strangely avoided by some for decades and some escaped entirely.  Finally, the author gives us a tour of the revisionists who try to deny the truth about the mass murders at the three Auschwitz camps.<br /><br />Her writing is clear and straightforward.  She tells us these monstrous things without adding emotion into her writing.  We don't need any help in feeling the horror and revulsion.  We know she feels it, too.  The book never gets gruesome or clinical and provides an amazing number of facts in its 168 pages.  There are maps of the area and diagrams of the three camps and a picture taken by prisoners in the camp of bodies being burned on the ground.<br /><br />This is quite an amazing little book and can help its readers understand the realities behind the word that we all use as a brand name for unspeakable evil.g, starvation, disease, beating, medical experimentation, and even doctors injecting phenol directly into prisoners' hearts.

Using the name as a shortcut for the Holocaust, for genocide, mass murder, poison gas, crematoria, Nazi SS terror troops, and more actually cheats us. This rather small book takes on the big task of telling in a very straightforward way how Auschwitz came to be, what happened there during the Second World War, and its aftermath.<br /><br />Auschwitz is the name the Germans applied to a Polish town as they moved to the East to provide \\"Living Space\\" and a buffer against the Soviets. At first they moved the Poles out of the town to other prison camps and then brought them back and killed thousands. IG Farben decided it could use the slave labor such camps could provide and so a huge factory was built. But the camp was too far away for malnourished prisoners to travel each day. They had hoped these prisoners would be at least half as effective as a healthy German. The prisoners, starved, beaten, and traumatized, were only about 20% as effective. So, a camp was built next to the plant.<br /><br />Soviet Prisoners of War by the thousands were also brought to an Auschwitz camp to be slaves, they ended up being useless for that purpose. More than 10,000 of them were killed as well. When the war effort began going badly the camps moved into extermination and a huge third camp was begun with enough capacity to burn more than 4,500 bodies per day. They were never all in service at the same time, but what did exist was so overburdened with use that they became damaged and required repair. Bodies were burned in open trenches during the repairs.<br /><br />The author teaches us that the 4 million killed in Auschwitz was based by the Soviets on theoretical crematoria capacity. Scholars studying the subject now believe that between 1.1 and 1.5 million were killed there in various ways. There was the Zyklon B and cremation, but there was also shooting, starvation, disease, beating, medical experimentation, and even doctors injecting phenol directly into prisoners' hearts. We are shown how this easily fits in with the number of 6 million Jews killed during the war. In the beginning only about half of those killed were Jews, by the frantic last days it was almost all Jews.<br /><br />The book also takes us through the trials related to Auschwitz (not all the war crimes trials) and what was uncovered and how punishment was meted out and strangely avoided by some for decades and some escaped entirely. Finally, the author gives us a tour of the revisionists who try to deny the truth about the mass murders at the three Auschwitz camps.<br /><br />Her writing is clear and straightforward.

This perfectly titled book is a well written memoir that recounts key events from his working class roots through his selfless return to the Senate after the frenzied Strom Thurmond affair.  The book has the right size and pace for the story it tells.  One of the justifications of a book treatment of a subject is whether or not the book gives you insight into a topic that is not available through news reports.  This book delivers those insights and details.  I came away feeling I understood Senator Lott much better even when I disagree with his actions or views.<br /><br />Lott grew up in a working class family whose parents' marriage was strained.  His father held many jobs with varying degrees of failure and then drank too much to deaden the pain.  Still, Lott did well in school, went to Ole Miss and got his law degree.  He was did very well socially and got a well connected job in a good firm that led to him working on the staff of a prominent Mississippi Congressman, William Colmer.<br /><br />Eventually, he was elected to the US House of Representatives and rose to becoming minority whip.  When the opportunity came, he ran for the Senate and was elected to that chamber in 1988.  His tales of his work there and his rise through those ranks to becoming minority leader and the majority leader are all very interesting.<br /><br />As Lott discusses his political genuine accomplishments and dealings with others in government, it is clear that he is a man of energy, quality, purpose, and one who has great faith in government.  He is surely in his proper element in Congress.<br /><br />During his time as Majority Leader he worked very closely with President Clinton.  They, along with the House, were able to pass a great deal of legislation including Welfare Reform.  This close working partnership was fostered by their common political adviser, Dick Morris.  Unfortunately, this was also during the 1996 Presidential campaign and had a deleterious effect on the Dole campaign.  I do not know if this was decisive, but Lott admits that the Dole campaign was well aware of the problem this legislative festival had for them.  The Senator expresses some trouble with this divided loyalty, but claims larger considerations.<br /><br />Senator Lott also worked very hard to try and get a tobacco settlement.  It would have been a huge bill and as Lott describes it, what he was working for would have been much better than the awful settlement done by the various states.  Lott admits that he likes to make law, and, for me, this bill is a perfect example of why this is more of a vice than a virtue.  The only reason such public action against the tobacco industry is possible is because adult smoking has dropped from nearly 60% when I was a child to under 25% today.  They are a political minority and since smoking is continually diminishing and becoming increasingly a socially unacceptable practice, why is this huge lawsuit necessary?  Certain lawyers petitioned for over a BILLION dollars in fees.  I do not know what they were paid, but it seems insane to me.  This was much more about the states trying to get money to balance their budgets so they can keep the money spigot flowing.<br /><br />The real damage of this approach is discovered only later.  Others use these same precedents to sue other industries on ever more specious charges, but the companies have to settle because the public and the courts are already acculturated to taking the money to fund the states and reward those who brought the suits.  This is a Pandora's Box that should never have been opened.<br /><br />However, the way Trent Lott was treated for a few casual remarks for Strom Thurmond's 100th (!!!) birthday party is just inexcusable.  No one believes Lott is a racist.  Admittedly the words were careless and Lott explains how they came about.  I believe his explanation.  However, Lott brought much of the misery on himself.  He handled the early fires poorly and as they grew despite his multiple apologies he lost his bearing and hid out in Florida.<br /><br />The most interesting and telling part of the book is Lott's expression of disappointment in the President, his staff, and certain Senators who should have supported him and, Lott feels, could have saved him from having to resign.  I wonder if they all remember how Lott, with larger considerations in mind, threw Dole overboard, and felt justified with their own larger considerations.  Washington politics are tough and Lott came out on the bad side of that.<br /><br />However, I don't want to be too hard on him.  Lott could have resigned the Senate as well and put the Republicans back in the 50/50 power sharing mode of 2000.  That would have been horrible.  Instead, Lott showed real maturity and stayed on.  He worked with the new leadership and helped them as much as they would let him.  Lott tells us how he would have done things differently, and I have to admit he does sound like a more skillful hand.  But where was that skill and ability during the Thurmond crisis?<br /><br />This is a good read if you are interested in contemporary politics.

The author lets the people of that time speak to us through their personal journals, newspapers, and books.  While the author does provide a brief introduction in order to give us context for each vignette, he let's us learn about the events and times directly from those who lived them.<br /><br />While the next to the last chapter discusses the Church leaving Kirtland, the last chapter gives us helpful and inspiring information about the Church returning to Kirtland in the 1950s and the growth of the Church since that time.  If you visit the city now you can not only enjoy the rebuilt historical sites and visitors' center, you can also note the beautiful church buildings the local residents use for worship and other meetings throughout the week.<br /><br />It is a delightful book to read and is designed mainly for members of the Church and others who are interested in the Church during the early 1830s.  It is not meant to be a critical history or to strike up controversy and I am thankful for that.<br /><br />Mr. Anderson also provides us with illustrations, tables, and the inside covers have a map of the city from those times (well, town).  There are also endnotes and a helpful index.	2005-09-06

This book is a case in point.  The writer is clearly a sound scholar on Islam and Muhammad.  However, his French communist and atheist worldview permeate his discussions of the rise of Muhammad and Islam.  It doesn't matter if the writer or reader is a Freudian, capitalist, communist, atheist, agnostic, or a true believer.  Your way of viewing the world has to have an influence on how you tell your story, what metaphors and terms you use in your explanations, and much of what you consider normal and well known is actually less than clear to those unfamiliar with your view of things.<br /><br />Those readers not clearly aware of social assumptions of communism and the rather arrogant superiority of French socialism will find some of the text bewildering even in this fine English translation.  This is unfortunate because much of the author's writing does help non-believers understand the life of this world religious figure.  It isn't that the social-political stuff turns the facts into lies, it is simply that a reader uninitiated in these increasingly antiquated ways of viewing the world will find the author's points somewhat opaque because of the language the points are couched in rather than any complexity in the underlying point.<br /><br />For those of us who completely reject the socialist communist version of the world it is also quite irritating to read.<br /><br />So, beware.	2005-09-04

It reads very well and has a great deal of interesting information.<br /><br />One of the difficulties in writing a book like this is how to balance the personal details with the epic story of the global corporation.  I believe Collier and Horowitz pull off the balance quite well.  However, when this book came out there was a great deal of discussion about the womanizing that the family worked hard to keep out of the public eye.  Some condemned this book because of these intimate details.  Some claimed they were fabricated.  Nowadays, given what we know about public versus private lives, it probably would not raise many eyebrows.<br /><br />The life of Henry the Great is fascinating because of his genius and his limitations.  His son Edsel has a story that is as tragic as any you might read in fiction.  Henry II was given the task of saving the family company and with the team he built around himself he did an admirable job.  The battles with Lee Iacocca may be slipping into ancient history, but it is still a very interesting story in the history of corporate governance.  The recounting of Henry II's divorces and such may be fairly petty and is certainly not as important as his missing the real threat of the Japanese car companies.<br /><br />The book is now almost twenty years old, but it still has its merits.	2005-09-04

Its success was cataclysmic and was due in part to its perfection in timing.  It hit at the very moment when the self anointed \\"Masters of the Universe\\" were becoming exposed to the general public and the materialistic and hedonistic culture of the eighties was becoming transformed.  (At the time we didn't realize it would be a trade of the Culture of Greed for the Ravenous Orgy of Greed in the nineties.)<br /><br />This book offered wonderful phrases such as Social X-Rays, Lemon Tart, and so many more that you will be amazed when you re-read it or read the book for the first time.  It has a fascinating story that weaves together the cultures of privilege (for there are many) and the dregs of misery.  Each and every character is presented as someone with his or her own delusions of self, hypocrisies, and contradictory motivations.<br /><br />Now, this is not a novel in the sense of Thomas Mann or any other psychological writer.  This is a novel of social reporting that continues to stand the test of time and you will gain from reading it several times.  However, do NOT under any circumstances think that the movie made with the same title as this book in any way represents the wonderful things these pages contain.  The movie is a complete botch while the book remains a treasure.	2005-09-04

Islam has spread beyond the bounds of the Arabs, but there is no mistaking the centrality of Islam in the life of the various groups that are all identified as Arabs (because of the language they speak - the language of the Qur'an).<br /><br />In the early centuries, Prof. Hourani speaks of the religion formed into an empire and the various schools of thought became the various branches of Islam (not exactly like the different sects within Christianity). There are several chapters on the Ottoman Empire and its clashes with Europe and the Mongols coming from China.<br /><br />With the decline and final collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the role of Europe becomes dominant after World War I. As the European Powers leave after World War II the author traces the rise of Arabism and the issue of Israel. The decades after the 1967 War are knotty ones and many people will take different approaches to explaining the history of these times.<br /><br />This latest edition also includes Malise Ruthven as an author since Prof. Hourani died in 1993, shortly after the first edition came out. While this is humbly called \\"A History\\" rather than \\"The History\\", it has become the definitive book for the general reader who wants to know more about this subject. Given the present troubles in the world, this is a great resource and we should take the time to read it so we can understand more about the history that continues to be a force in shaping our times.<br /><br />The caveat I will provide is that the book presents a rather positive view of the Arab world. He does not deal with issues that the West sees as problems in their culture, such as the status of women, the continued use of slavery, and so forth. There is a lot the authors could have written to show the Arab world as more internally complex. However, that would probably have taken the book beyond its intended scope.mplex.

Islam does not view itself that way and neither should we.  Here we get a concise telling of the origins of Islam, what Muhammad actually did in spreading his faith.<br /><br />The explanation the book gives of the vast difference in the way Islam views believers and unbelievers (this includes Jews and Christians as well as polytheists and atheists) and it is quite important for all non-Muslims to understand this clearly.  The Islamic view of rightness involves only what is good for the promotion of Islam.  There is no sense of equality or fair play or pluralism in Islamic society.  It is quite all right to lie to non-Muslims if it promotes Islam.  This is why Islamic leaders say such apparently pluralistic things in English, but in Arabic they share their true and hostile views quite openly.  The Islamist view is that where they are the majority, there should be no other religion.  While they do not force conversions per se, they make life so hard on non-Muslims that over time many do convert.  Where Muslims are the minority they view the majority as holding unjust power.  After all, the whole world is Allah's and anyone should submit to that view, or so Muslims believe.<br /><br />Remember that when you read anything from CAIR.  You need to carefully translate what they are saying with the idea that they do not accept pluralism or even the American Constitution as desirable.  Their goal is to make America and every other country a Muslim state.<br /><br />The second part of this book shares information about the Crusades.  Again, this is valuable because about the only thing anyone is taught about the Crusades these days is that they were acts of Christian aggression.  In truth, they were a response to Islamic hostility in conquering European lands.  Remember, that Islam has tried to conquer Europe many times since the seventh century.  They held most of Spain for seven hundred years and were at the gates of Vienna in the seventeenth century.  Certainly, atrocities, by our standards, were committed.  However, Islamic aggression towards Europe was not brought about because of actions the Christian nations took (except for not submitting to Islam).<br /><br />Part Three of the book talks about the continuing Jihad on the part of the Islamicists and how it is connected to the strict version of Islam supported by Saudi Arabia and Iran's Islamic Revolution.  There is a reason they still talk about the Crusades.  They have never abandoned their goal of Talibanizing the world (to use a modern term for it).  And now they have billions upon billions of dollars of Oil Money to fund their ambitions.<br /><br />The book has lots of side notes.  Some are on books that you might want to read on the various topics discussed in the book.  They are all delightfully non-PC.  There are also bulleted nuggets of information on Islam and some boxes comparing the teachings of Jesus and Muhammad.  The author has provided ample endnotes and a useful index.<br /><br />To get a lot from this book you do not need to agree with what the author is saying.

Prof. Caesar Farah teaches History at the University of Minnesota and earned his Ph.D from Princeton in 1956.  It is not meant to be controversial, political, or anything more and less than a helpful brief overview for those trying get a handle on a given topic.  The tone here may seem supportive of Islam, but that is simply because it refuses to be negative and to take Islam on its own terms.  This is appropriate for someone who is learning about Islam in order to, say, engage in business in an Islamic country or to engage an Islamic group in America.  One must understand its roots and principles in a way that will not give offence, or why bother learning about it.<br /><br />Prof. Farah takes us on a whirlwind tour of Muhammad and his founding of Islam, his successors.  He explains the Qur'an and how it came to be and written down over a hundred years later.  There are other sources of interpretation for Islamic law and these are explained as well.  The five principles of Islam are also explained.<br /><br />The goal of the book seems to be to make Islam seem less foreign to the Western reader.  However, it can get a bit bewildering when Farah explains over a dozen different sects of Islam and how they came to be with their various claims.  The author also gives us a very fast tour of Islam in its various forms around the globe.<br /><br />If you want a basic book on Islam and are willing to accept the premise of Islam as a legitimate religion with positive things to offer, then this is a good book for you.	2005-09-01

The struggle often devolves into one group urging the status quo; that the organization simply needs to get back to its roots and the get behind the products that had been successful in the past.  Surely, they argue, these ideas and products can be successful once again.  Another group, more pessimistic, urges that the company be turned into a cash cow, stripped of all extra costs (including R&D) and every penny of profit extracted, hoping for a permanent and profitable floor in sales.  They continue cutting costs and chasing elusive profitability as the company continues its slide towards oblivion.  A third group argues for renewal.  They argue that the original company and product was absolutely new and full of risks.  To grow and thrive, this group pleads, the company must take risks, invest in new products, change processes, and move into a dominant position in the new marketplace.<br /><br />Doing anything new is risky because no one knows exactly how things will turn out.  However, the apparent safety of doing the same old thing is an illusion.  Tomorrow is never the same as today and today isn't yesterday.  We are always having to adapt to a new environment or go extinct.  The issue is are we chasing survival or working to gain a position of dominance and the ability to thrive.<br /><br />This book does a fine job of explaining the company conditions required to manage innovation, the kinds of innovation to pursue (radical or incremental - aggressive or defensive), how to measures, reward, and what internal conditions are required to foster the right kind of innovation for your organization.<br /><br />I like that this book discusses failure and how to contain it.  Not every idea or initiative will succeed.  The danger is in letting the fear of failure force you to either over fund an idea and harm the company, or cut all creativity out of the company for fear of spending a nickel on something that goes nowhere.  The authors also discuss sharing risk through partnering, outsourcing, and gathering ideas from outside the company that invigorate and spark new work inside the walls of your company.<br /><br />This is a practical book.  The focus is on making new ideas that add profitability rather than doing something new simply because it is new.  The authors always speak in terms of bounds.  The vignettes (not quite case studies) demonstrate some failures along with all the successes and I really appreciate that honesty.  As the authors note, sometimes learning what not to do contributes as much as anything else in learning what it is you should do.<br /><br />This is not a book with its eyes in the clouds about trying to capture genius in a bottle.  It simply teaches managers that they have the responsibility to renew their company.  That innovation cannot succeed without direct and appropriate support from the CEO and that there must be a series of other organizational supports to allow innovation to happen in a way that contributes to company growth.  If you carefully read this book and think through what it has to offer, I am sure you will be able to find a way to apply much of what the authors offer us.m the company, or cut all creativity out of the company for fear of spending a nickel on something that goes nowhere.

Books	5	71	74	N	N	Great information and resources for getting a handle on financing your retirement	Ben Stein and Phil DeMuth have done us a real favor by speaking the unvarnished truth about what needs to be done by everyone who will face retirement.  They have provided a clear and sensible approach that can be easily adapted whether you are planning on retirement in five years or in fifty.  Obviously, the more time you have until retirement, the better you can prepare.<br /><br />What I particularly like about the approach taken here is that it doesn't pretend that if everyone followed their advice that society would be rid of the problem of the Baby Boomers moving into their retirement decades (nowadays, retirement lasts much longer than most of us realize).  This is a book for YOU.  As the authors admit, the idea that everyone will follow the advice offered in this book is roughly nil.  However, it is a book about each of us taking responsibility for our own future and rescuing our elderly self.  I like the notion the authors put forward about our common fantasy of wishing we could help our younger self do better with what we have learned in life.  However, the past cannot be changed.  We do have ability to help our future self live better if we will take the proper steps now.  When Stein and DeMuth say, \\"now\\", they mean today, not sometime when you finally have extra money to sock away.  Somehow that time of future affluence never seems to materialize by itself.<br /><br />Stein and DeMuth take away all our comforting delusions about Social Security and the inevitable choices the government will have to make someday.  In all their calculations they also warn us about tax assumptions that can change as future politicians need access to our savings and wealth to fund their programs.  The overall point of their warnings is that you need to prepare for your future as if you had to pay for it by yourself.<br /><br />They help us think through our home, different kinds of investments to store our savings (and hopefully earn some more as well), thinking carefully about how and where we live, how long we should (need to) work, how to keep earning during retirement, and urge us to realize that any pain we think we would incur with the level of savings needed to fund our retirement will not go away if delayed.  It will simply be pain that will be saved and collect interest and will make our future self more impoverished and miserable than he needed to be.<br /><br />There are many worksheets so we can learn the principles by thinking carefully about our own situation.  The book also has some helpful principles that are easy to commit to memory.  I also liked the section of the book that takes us from our teenage years to retirement and what we should be accomplishing financially during those years.<br /><br />The way Stein and DeMuth focus on doing prudent things with an emphasis on steady behavior, low cost investing, with rebalancing every five years (so you don't spend too much rebalancing every year, or finding your portfolio seriously out of whack current market realities), and taking as few risks with money you must preserve for your future, I think is extremely helpful.  They warn against hoping that there is some kind of lottery win or stock market miracle that will come and provide for your future.  The only person one who will care for the older you is the present you.  Please do yourself a favor and read this book and then get to work.<br /><br />The authors use that old joke about outrunning the bears.  You don't have to be faster than all the bears, just the guys running next to you.  And the truth is the YOUNGER you are when you start this marathon, the easier it will be to outdistance the bears.  So, YOUNG PEOPLE will benefit from this book as much as or even more than those near retirement.<br /><br />Fine book, and very much needed.

Either the conversation will absorb these new points and shift direction or the ideas will be rejected as too foreign and the points will never even be considered.<br /><br />Ralph Peters is a former colonel in the Army and an intelligence officer who is now an author of books of various types and a columnist.  What he offers in this very interesting book is so different than the debate you will see, hear, and read in the popular media that it might be quite disconcerting.  However, keep reading and get through the book and consider what he has to say.  You might reject every point he makes and will still be better off having read and thought about what he has to say because it will sharpen your own beliefs and encourage you to dig more deeply into the material relating to what the author offers us in these pages.<br /><br />Mr. Peters says that America has a future as great as its past if it is willing to be intelligent, flexible, and fresh in its approaches to the complexities in the present world.  He advocates moving away from our traditional ties to Europe because of their ossification and inwardness.  They are too corrupt to do anything but to continue their decay.  Instead, Peters advocates that America turn to building positive relations with South America and Africa, to work on influencing the non-Arab Muslims in Asia and India, and to rely on positive economic development with these groups rather than sheer military force.<br /><br />The author says that in the present War on Terror, which must be fought, we have not been fierce enough.  We need to break the enemy and destroy him until he sues for peace.  If all we want is to fight to bring them to the table to talk our enemy wins because not losing is enough to achieve their aims.<br /><br />Mr. Peters has no use for Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.  He also thinks that the Air Force has been far too influential in military planning.  We spend far too much on its projects that contribute almost nothing to our ability to actually wage war.  The expensive weapons have to stay too far above the battlefield to provide the true air support needed to aid the men on the ground.  Peters holds to the doctrine that war is awful and bloody and must be won by men driving the enemy from the field through violence and slaughter.  It is ugly, but it is what war is about.  To this end he advocates the abolition of the Air Force and to divide its assets between the Navy and the Army and to revive the Army Air Corps.<br /><br />Mr. Peters wants America to succeed, prosper, and add to its glory in the world.  Whether or not he has the right prescription is up to you.<br /><br />This is a very different kind of discussion, but quite interesting and very much worth reading.f Defense Donald Rumsfeld.

He notes that the goal of the Depression focused the American economy on providing full employment.  This led the government to support the rise of the huge steel, communications, automotive, mining, and other large corporations and those that supported them.<br /><br />These corporations used their might (along with union might and supportive governmental regulation) to fight off and restrict competition.  Mr. London sees this weak competitive environment as one of the causes of the inflation during the seventies.  He also faults Richard Nixon for his wage and price controls and political influence on the Federal Reserve.  He gives great credit to Presidents Ford and Carter for having the political courage to fight inflation and to take painful steps to right the economic cart.<br /><br />He notes that it was Carter, not Reagan, who put Volcker in charge of the Federal Reserve and deserves the credit for Volcker's success.  Mr. London also expresses some skepticism in the monetary and tax cut approach to encouraging growth.  He goes so far as to say that Greenspan's reputation is inflated because he had little to do with the success of the economy in the eighties and especially in the nineties.  For Mr. London, it was the competition with the Japanese that forced the automotive companies to increase efficiency and hold prices down.  It was small steel companies such as Nucor that saved the American Steel industry.  He also notes that breaking up the AT&T cartel that fought every innovation that has led to vastly increased service offerings at a much lower cost.  He also tells the story of how competition has affected the airlines, our banking regime, and retailing (he notes that Wal-Mart keeping prices low has helped fight inflation).<br /><br />I think he makes some very good points.  However, I cannot go all the way with him.  Taxation does play a huge role in our business environment and we have to be careful what distortions we build into our market system.  And his dismissal of monetary policy is far to facile for me.  Printing money too much money has always been a tool of governments trying to get away with something.  It always brings inflation through a devalued currency (not just devalued exchange rates, which can be just fine).<br /><br />Mr. London also talks about how competition can help our current problems in education and health care.  His prescriptions are not very detailed, but I am encouraged in the different role he sees for government in fixing these problems.  Rather than more government programs and greater government control, he encourages intelligent encouragement of private enterprise in both environments through regulatory incentives that will lower costs (for example, by mandating electronic medical records) and make a more level playing field for innovation.<br /><br />This is a good book and well worth reading.  And I like the breath of fresh air approach rather than a restating of the normal doctrines of our times from either the left or the right.  Well worth reading and discussing.points.

Auden is rightly regarded as one of the great poets of the twentieth century.  He is one of my favorites because of his great skill with language, his ability to talk about everyday life in wonderfully insightful ways, and to sing while he helps us see what he sees.  His even greater gift is to make his words feel as if they came from out of our own mind and heart.  We want to possess them.<br /><br />Yet, he was also a very learned man, but his learning always has a point about life rather than allowing him to step into a spotlight for our adulation.  You can flip to any page of this volume and find something to wonder at.  Even the plainest poems have depths to plumb and the seemingly obscure yield to patient reading.<br /><br />While Auden has a somewhat complicated biography, it would be a mistake to get sidetracked in too many details.  While knowing the life of an artist often aids our understanding of his work, it is also a mistake to see too many parallels in his work with the happenstance of his life.  Great artists draw on their lives, but they also transcend them.<br /><br />I am very grateful to have this volume in my library.	2005-08-20

His work has inspired many great artists in poetry, literature, religious exegesis, painting, sculpture, music, and drama.  There is a reason William Blake, himself a great poet, called him the Divine Milton.<br /><br />This great volume brings together all of Milton's poetry at a very affordable price.  It is a volume you will want to have on your shelf and spend many hours reading and re-reading.  You will find his language easy to read, but to pull the meaning out of the words will require close attention.  There are many great works in this volume, but half of the volume consists of three major works: \\"Paradise Lost\\" (a favorite for so many for the past three centuries), \\"Paradise Regained\\", and \\"Samson Agonistes\\".  People were most passionate about these poems when religion was more a part of daily life and was present in all aspects of our culture.  Even today, critics as sophisticated as Harold Bloom find the Satan of \\"Paradise Lost\\" one of the great literary achievements of all time.<br /><br />Reading these fabulous stories as poems energizes the appetite for more epic poetry.  That is a great additional reward after receiving the gift of Milton's powerful images and beautiful language.	2005-08-19

While some of us do write on a regular basis, nearly everyone has to at least occasionally put words on paper for one reason or another. We get tense because we are unsure what to put on that very blank page. We are armed with only some vague and incomplete memories of usage rules from our school days, and we wisely don't fully trust what we remember. The idea of reading through a textbook on grammar and writing is not very appealing and going back to school for a class is impractical. What can we do to improve our writing and feel more confident in what we present to others?<br /><br />William Safire is a well-known writer and authority whom many trust to pass judgment on what is fair and foul about the rules we use in our writing. He is no curmudgeon when it comes to writing and appeals more to usage, what sounds right to the ear, and what communicates the writer's meaning with verve and clarity.  These little articles will help you with pesky split infinitives, punctuation, capitalization, sentence construction, participle issues, and word usage.<br /><br />This book was published years ago as \\"Fumblerules\\". A fumblerule is a sentence that teaches a writing principle by being a clearly and often humorous example of breaking the rule. You immediately see why writing that way is a mistake. He has fifty column length articles here; each devoted to clarifying one rule. I enjoyed all of them and had more than a few laughs as I read through the book.<br /><br />It is likely that you already know and keep most of these rules, but if you only get a more sure grip on five or ten of these rules, you will have been richly rewarded for the money you plunked down and couple of hours you spend thinking about the advice Safire provides.<br /><br />Super!	2005-08-18

Kids who grow up with highly charged attitudes towards money often have a hard time in managing their finances with larger goals in mind.  Chaotic finances are too often a contributor to chaos and pain in personal lives, as well.<br /><br />Eileen and Jon Gallo stress being an intelligent parent first.  Communication, appropriate teaching, example, and trust are the basis of a sound parent-child bond.  In this book, they stress teaching healthy attitudes and approaches to personal finance because too many lives get sidetracked when money is handled poorly.<br /><br />Rather than providing a book of tips on building a financial empire or guiding your children into careers on Wall Street, this book is about everyday lives.  It is for parents with children of any age, including adult children.  And, especially, the authors stress that it is never too late to being.  You will be better off starting now on improvement rather than regretting that you had not begun earlier and then letting tomorrow continue down the same painful road.<br /><br />The book is built around eight sound and helpful steps:<br /><br />1. Encourage a work ethic<br />2. Get your money stories straight<br />3. Facilitate financial reflection<br />4. Become a charitable family<br />5. Teach financial literacy<br />6. Be aware of the values you model<br />7. Moderate your extreme money tendencies<br />8. Talk about the tough topics<br /><br />I especially like they way each of these principles is handled.  Not only do the authors discuss each principle, they also provide help in approaches to understanding your own example and how to create teaching opportunities with your child.  It is a very practical book.  It also has a very supportive tone that focuses on lifting everyone involved in these exercises in improvement.<br /><br />Money is a part of everyone's life and ignoring it will not make it go away but will almost certainly make circumstances worse.  Bad news collects interest over time and becomes an ever larger problem that will eventually have to be solved.  Better to start on the right path and keep things in a healthy mode with a positive perspective.<br /><br />This book can be a real help.life and ignoring it will not make it go away but will almost certainly make circumstances worse.

It is a powerful speech that rallies people at all times and in every place. Sir Lawrence Olivier made a film version in 1944 during WWII and Kenneth Branagh made another as recently as 1989. You can count on there being more versions. Epecially so when computers can help them make spectacular battle scenes (that aren't really in the play) with less expense.<br /><br />Audiences love this play and they should. There is a lot to like and enjoy. I think upon repeated readings Henry becomes a more equivocal character than he seems at first. And readers of the King Henry IV plays will know him before he became King Henry and know something deeper about his personality.<br /><br />And of course there is the whole bit about the drive to France being sponsored by the Church to avoid confiscation of property by the Crown. Moreover, there is the slaughtering of the French prisoners, and his treatment of Falstaff (who dies offstage in this play). This isn't revisionist stuff, it is right there in the play, but it is easy to miss the first time you are trying to take in the play.<br /><br />In any case, this Arden edition is the one to buy and read from. Why? Because it has the most authoritative text, but that is only the beginning. It also shows variants between the early sources. The notes at the bottom of each page of the play are simply fabulous. The editor includes not only helpful notes explaining what might be obscure in the text of the play, he provides sources Shakespeare probably used such as Holinshed and makes for some very interesting study. There are also some helpful notes on how various scenes have been performed over time.<br /><br />And to make this sound more like an infomercial, you get more! The introduction provides great background material on the play, its sources, and how it has been performed throughout history. After the play, there is a photo reproduction of the first Quarto from 1600 and it is fairly readable. There are also a couple of maps showing the path of the English Army from Harfleur through other towns on its way to Calais and makes clear how they had to pass through Agincourt.<br /><br />There is also a helpful genealogical table so you can see the confusing claims used by Henry and the French nobility to make their claims. And there is a doubling chart so you can see how theater companies can perform all the roles with fewer actors.<br /><br />This is a great edition as are all the plays published by the Arden Shakespeare. The amount of work collected in these volumes is stunning and they will enrich your experience of the plays tremendously. I can't recommend them enough.duction of the first Quarto from 1600 and it is fairly readable.

It is vivid, has blood & murder, magic, visions, treachery, and just deserts. I mean, what is not to love? The play moves along quickly and isn't one of the longer plays. For all these reasons and more, audiences love it.<br /><br />But there is a lot more to the play than the plot outline might suggest. Shakespeare brilliantly works out the subtleties of character through the action, interactions, and self-discussions in the play. It isn't a simple \\"action\\" play, it is also a masterwork of revealing the character of the characters even when they are themselves unaware of the trap they are leaping into.<br /><br />I am partial to the Arden editions because I trust the text, love the extensive notes, and the introductory and additional material that helps give the play context and talks about sources Shakespeare almost certainly used. In this case Holinshed's \\"Chronicles of Scotland\\". Throughout this edition there are also discussions of the textural problems of this play: where some things seem to be missing, what might be interpolations, and so forth.<br /><br />This is a very useful edition of a great play.	2005-08-14

It is impossible to talk about this event without reflecting on the reporting by John Hersey, but Stephen Walker has done something a bit larger.  Not only has he read broadly the various histories (including Hersey) written about that time, he takes us through the conference at Yalta, the politics Washington D. C., what was happening at Los Alamos, at Tinian Island, in the war rooms in Tokyo, and what a few of the citizens in Hiroshima were doing to get through the hard times of the war.  We also get to ride on the plane with the crew of the Enola Gay and the other planes that were part of that mission.<br /><br />By admitting that I was afraid of that this book was going to be a criticism of the way America ended the war in the Pacific, I also admit that I believe the bombing was a necessary and important act.  However, my beliefs are not important in this review.  What I want to tell you is that the author does a superb job of reporting how different people viewed the events without tipping his own hand.  It would be easy for any reader to project his own beliefs on his writing, but it is hard to say definitively what Mr. Walker believes about August 6, 1945.<br /><br />I was afraid he would not include the spying that went on for the Soviets at Los Alamos.  He does include Klaus Fuchs, but not David Greenglass or Ted Hall.  This is probably a good choice because it would divert from the main narrative.  The main point is that Stalin knew about the bomb at the Yalta conference and that Truman and Churchill did not know that Stalin already knew.<br /><br />The discussion of peace efforts of the Japanese reaching out to the Soviets and some of the views in the administration in Washington about using the bomb might lead the reader to believe that Mr. Walker believes that there were other better choices than dropping the bomb.  Maybe the author believes that.  I don't know.  However, the author does note other voices that claim that dropping those bombs saved lives.  Not only American lives, but Japanese lives as well.  He is clear that the Soviets had begun their invasion of Manchuria.  Mr. Walker is also very clear that Hiroshima and every other major Japanese city would have been part of the fire bombing campaign that had already burned Tokyo and other Japanese cities killing many hundreds of thousands.<br /><br />The author also notes the suffering that Americans endured during the Bataan Death March, during the taking of Iwo Jima and other islands in the Pacific campaign, let alone Pearl Harbor.  He is careful to not make the Japanese into innocents.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the material the author had from Japanese survivors of the blast and how he weaves their lives and accounts into this story.  It does humanize those who died and suffered in Hiroshima.  It is clear that it was a city rather than the military base Truman claimed in his first statement on the matter.  I also did not know that a couple of dozen American POWs were killed in the bombing.  Some were killed in the blast and others murdered by outraged citizens after the bombing.  It is one of those sad collateral events of the war that could not and should not have stopped the bombing, but is still important to note and remember.<br /><br />This is a book I hope everyone will read and think about.  It is not a simple matter no matter how you come down on the bombing itself.  War is an awful thing, but if it is to be waged there are awful consequences for so many.  Is it better to wage it harshly and brutally so that it is short with victory in view?  Or is it better to use it as a wedge to a political solution however the compromise has to be made?  Or is it something else?<br /><br />Mr. Walker doesn't decide for you and that is one of the strengths of this fine book.b.  Maybe the author believes that.  I don't know.

David Berlinski has an easy, if a bit chatty, style that lends itself to description and helping people feel they understand something even if they really have not a clue.  This is NOT a primer on calculus.  If you don't have a clue about what calculus is, you might pick up some notions of what it is you will want to learn, but you won't come away understanding how to work problems.  But that was never the aim of this book.<br /><br />My guess is that the best audience for this book is any student, young or old, who has his or her algebra and geometry under control and beginning to appreciate what calculus is.  This book will help the student understand what calculus is for, how it came about, and thus provide some good intuitions and insights as he or she begins study of the subject.  It might also be a pleasant read for those who took calculus some time ago and like reading about science and math.<br /><br />There are many reasons why this book has remained popular for so long.  Just don't mistake it for a tutorial or primer on the subject and you can enjoy it for what it is.	2005-08-09

The fifties were a time of great change as a whole generation came home from a war with more experience and ideas than they could ever have had staying at home.  Halberstam provides not only a history of that time, but tells us the story of how certain things began that changed America in ways that continue into our time.  It was the time just after the Hiss-Chambers hearings and the rise of television.  Theses were the times of the Korean War, McCarthy and Kefauver, of Kinsey, Hefner, Marilyn Monroe, and Brando, of mass marketing, Lucille Ball, Uncle Miltie, and Ozzie and Harriet.  New styles of writing burst on the scene with Mickey Spillane, Ginsberg, Kerouac, William S. Burroughs, and Tennessee Williams. Of Sputnik, h-bombs, and open air testing where the mushroom clouds could be seen in Vegas.<br /><br />He talks about the rise of subdivisions - suburbia - a house and a lawn out of the city and how all that began with Levittown using the principles of mass production and prefabrication and specialization that became so important in winning the War.  How about affordable discount stores?  The author shows us the rise of Korvette.  What about the new mobility because of Eisenhower's building of the Interstate Highways?  We get to see the rise of Holiday Inn and McDonalds.  And never forget about the role of IBM in helping to collect and analyze data for all these massive new companies, our expanding government, and to aid the military in the cold war.<br /><br />If you have any memories of this time it will be a wonderful and nostalgic tour of a time long gone.  If you are younger and want to learn the realities of what went on after WWII and how it gave rise to the sixties, this book is simply indispensable.<br /><br />Terrific.	2005-08-09

He was sharp, quick witted, capable of being funny, and honest.  This is a terrific book that not only lets us in on what a press secretary's job is really like, he gives us the inside story on many important events in the second Reagan and Bush administrations.  He also tells delicious stories about the Whitehouse press corps that are entertaining and informative.<br /><br />The author provides enough of his own biography, about fifty pages, to give us a better idea how he became who he is and how he came to Washington and ended up working for Larry Speakes, Reagan's press secretary at the time.  He grew up on a Kansas wheat farm, ended up working at some small newspapers and working his way through college like many of us less well to do children of the middle and working classes did and do.<br /><br />He provides some key insights into the Reagan administration and is not afraid to say when he thinks Reagan was less than successful or what his weaknesses were, in his view.  However, he is also extremely positive and explains where he thinks Reagan received bad advice and was less than well served by certain advisors.<br /><br />The accounts of the Bush administration are also excellent.  Each anecdote is not only interesting but is used to illustrate some principle of the media in Washington and how the feebback between the press and politics works.  The campaign between Bush and Clinton, whom the press adored, is especially illustrative.<br /><br />Each press secretary nowadays writes a book about their time in the hot seat, and they are usually good.  After all, they are in that job because they know how to tell a story and communicate with the media and through them with us.  But Fitzwater's book is a special example that sets the standard for all the rest.	2005-08-08

Frankly, I have come to enjoy his writing less and less over the years as he has become more strident and even shrill in his criticisms of our country and conservative religious faith.  However, this is a book I enjoyed very much and encourage everyone to read.<br /><br />Wills provides a good history of the address Lincoln gave at Gettysburg.  He provides a great context for our understanding of what was said that day.  One of the especially helpful things the author does is contrast Lincoln's brief address with the larger and more conventional (for their time) speech by the acclaimed orator, Edward Everett.<br /><br />Along with the terrific history, the author makes an argument that what Lincoln says in the address makes a statement for the future of the Union that is radically different than what the founders had set down.  He notes that Lincoln took actions and stated beliefs and purposes that were nothing less than a complete reinterpretation of America and how this address summarizes this view, however briefly.  Its genius is in the way it evokes the founding and fuses it with a vision that had never existed before nor had it been forged in the fire of public debate.  It was Lincoln's genius to bring the nation with him into this new vision.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with Wills, you will benefit from the great history and context he provides.  I especially enjoyed reading the speech by Edward Everett and the understanding it gave me of nineteenth century oratory.  Lincoln himself was capable of long and even extemporaneous speechmaking.  Just think on the Lincoln - Douglass debates and you will have all the evidence you need.  Yet, the genius in this little speech has come to be recognized with the passage of time and it is one of the treasures of our national patrimony.	2005-08-08

I remember the Mao posters and t-shirts of the 1970s and how he was revered a somehow the more humane face of true communism after Stalin's horrors were exposed.  Well, this book was given the same attacks as the books that exposed Stalin as the butcher he was.  And just as those books have been borne out over time, this memoir of one man's life in service to and a victim of Mao has also stood the test of time.<br /><br />It is fascinating to me how Mao became such a dominant figure in the Chinese psyche.  He really was a new Chinese Emperor.  The people were willing to take a lot because he unified them again.  Mao was a student of history, especially of the past emperors and knew exactly what his role was and what he could do.  For much of his rule he was not the head of the nominally ruling party nor himself the official holder of political office.  Even at the last when he was paralyzed with his last illness, he was still ruling the country and outmaneuvering his political opponents.  Never mind how many millions died under his leadership, the people adored him.  Even those who hated him became quite transfixed in his presence.  This despite the horros and chaos of  \\"The Great Leap Forward\\" in the fifties and the even more horrible \\"Cultural Revolution\\" of the sixties and seventies.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the way the doctor describes his times in favor and out of favor with Mao and when he was sent to an area of the country for his education that was so poor that the people not only ate rice husks, they mixed them with sand to fill their bellies.  Mao's decadent behaviors are also described in detail and it is interesting how he justified his hypocrisies, as all tyrants do, because of their special status and sacrifices for the people.<br /><br />While you will also want to read other books on Mao and his life, your understanding of him cannot be complete without reading this book as well.	2005-08-08

Ogden Nash is an example of how our need to label things can cheat us of clearly seeing something that is actually quite unique and important.  It is an understandable problem because it is hard to put a meaningful label on something that stands apart.  We say that he is the poet laureate of light verse, or a humorist, or a writer of joke verse.  His detractors call him a bad poet because he is \\"not serious\\".  Balderdash.  He was a very serious writer.  Though many have tried to copy him by going after some of his rhythms and wonderfully forced rhymes, they never pull it off because they are not as serious or as talented has he.<br /><br />Nash said that he looked on his work as essays in verse (pg 245) and noted several times how hard he had to work to create his works.  Never mind the fact that at one book signing he wrote a couplet along with his signature and of course everyone else wanted one, too.  That evening he had to spontaneously create 100 of these witty little things.  It was an incredibly draining evening.<br /><br />What is it about Nash's work that makes it stand apart?  Well, it is genuinely funny.  Not because it goes in for the cheap giggle or the linguistic pratfall.  It is because he has something real to say first and then has the ability to give the meaning energy and lift in fabulous words that are just right and the humor makes the point all the more meaningful and memorable.  Even when he does lay the verbal egg it is done with purpose and care in a way that rewards the reader.  Nash lets you know that he knows that you know that he knows what the joke is and you are in it together.<br /><br />This biography has a lot to do with his wife and daughters and that is appropriate since his domestic life informed so much of his work.  His publishers, for magazines and books, also make many appearances since he was an author who made his living from his earnings through publishing.  The New Yorker has a central place with his various editors over the years.  It is all very interesting stuff.<br /><br />However interesting the life, it is the work we hold close and Douglas Parker makes good selections and includes a lot of appropriate, relevant, and delightful works by Nash in his text.  We owe Mr. Parker a debt of gratitude and we can show that by purchasing this valuable book, reading it, and then digging into Ogden Nash once again.

Few of us don't hold a special place in our hearts for one Disney character or film (even if we won't admit it in sophisticated company).  James B. Stewart has written a terrific book documenting the reign of Michael Eisner over that empire.  Stewart quickly covers how Disney came to be and how it stagnated after Walt's (and Roy's) death.  This book really gets underway when Eisner, Wells, and Katzenberg arrive on the seen and begin ten years of phenomenal success and growth.<br /><br />Things changed drastically when Eisner broke with Katzenberg, Wells died in a helicopter crash, and Disney bought ABC.  The network became a drag on Disney rather than an engine for growth.  Eisner advocated the need for ABC to protect Disney from a hostile takeover.  Others never really bought that notion.  Some have seen Eisner has trying to recapture his early success in TV, but times had changed no matter what Eisner thought of his ability to make the network successful.  Whatever the reason, the integration of ABC into Disney has not been smooth or seamless.  The overpriced acquisition of Fox Family and the failed scheme of repurposing ABC programming on ABC Family was also an anchor to earnings and growth.<br /><br />However, this book is much more than a narrative of actions, acquisitions, and numbers.  In fact, there are very few numbers.  It provides rich insights into the politics, maneuvering, and outright fights between the many managers and directors involved in this story.  The cast of characters the author provides at the front of the book is a real help in following the machinations of the people who make up the fabric of this tale of ambition, greed, betrayal, and boardroom war.  The three main sections of the book tell the arc of the story:  The Wonderful World of Disney, The Disenchanted Kingdom, and Disney War.<br /><br />I found the background story of how certain programs got on the air, how movies were greenlighted and then backed or abandoned all fascinating.  The way failure was assigned to people often had nothing to do with their actual culpability, but rather the need to get someone off the plank and into the sea so that another's career ambitions could continue.  It was also fascinating how Eisner's ego never lets him be wrong even when he so clearly was.  As his power grew, and he carefully groomed its growth, his identity of self with this public corporation became not only odd, but also a bit creepy.  It is clear to me that the board of Disney managed the company for their own benefit and their egos rather than for the benefit of all shareholders.  However, I am sure that Eisner and others on the board do not see it that way.  One of the many strengths of this book is that the author does not take sides or make anyone out to be a villain (or a hero).  In fact, he often points out contradictory accounts of certain conversations and actions.  Stewart provides a balanced account that is very clear and lets each character speak for himself (or herself).<br /><br />For me, the saddest part of the story is the really bad behavior at the highest levels of management in the way they treated not only each other, but the employees they were managing.  One person said that Eisner liked to put six pit bulls together and see which five died.  Since Eisner was above the firing line, it was easy for him to keep rivals from becoming a threat to him by keeping them tearing each other apart.  One of Eisner's methods of staying in power was keeping the board afraid that he would leave because there was no one left who could run the company.  Just as a possible successor would appear, something would happen to undermine them and drive them away.  All coincidences.<br /><br />The epilogue does a superb job of analyzing Eisner and his time at the top of running Disney and noting that even though it appears Eisner is through in 2006, that it might not be so.  This isa book that should be widely read and I strongly recommend it.d I strongly recommend it.	2005-08-04

They accuse him of things he doesn't say and denounce him for arguments he not only doesn't make but goes out of his way to help the reader notice that he is not making them.  For example, he never makes the argument that the bias in the major media is the result of conscious decision making or a boardroom conspiracy.  He goes out of his way to show that it is the result of a more or less uniform culture in the decision making that goes on at those networks and newspapers.<br /><br />In this book Mr. Goldberg has some fun naming one hundred folks whose work, notoriety, or reason for prominence are based on things that, in Mr. Goldberg's view, make the nation less well off.  Some promote bad ideas, some weaken institutions that have done much good over the years, and some promote strengthening institutions that make us worse off.  Still, his critics go after him for this or that reason and make accusations that would not be made by someone who took time to read the book.<br /><br />And, of course, much of it has a lot to do with whose ox is being gored.  When Michael Moore was bashing \\"stupid white men\\" or Al Franken was accusing all his political opponents of being liars, all was right with the world.  But Mr. Goldberg goes after people of every stripe and the liberals go crazy and some conservatives go crazy as well.  The liberals think the author is just bashing the left and the conservatives fail to see the nuance in his statements.  For example, Mr. Goldberg goes after Roy Moore, not because he disagrees with displaying the Ten Commandments, but because if Judge Moore feels no obligation to follow duly enacted laws and judgments, what example does that set for the average person?  Does it strengthen or weaken the rule of law?  You may still disagree with the author, but at least dig enough into the book to understand what his arguments really are.<br /><br />I found this to be a fun book, informative, and at times a bit puzzling.  Are Bill and Hillary Clinton not included because the are the dogs who don't bark or because they are already on everyone's list, or because Mr. Goldberg doesn't think they are screwing up American?  I don't know.  Still, the list makes some great points and though you may disagree with some of the names included or left out, it is getting you to associate actions, politics with real people and names that make the point.  Getting to know the players helps you follow the game with more understanding and may help you make more informed decisions.<br /><br />Read it, enjoy it, and make your own list.<br /><br />Fine contribution to our public debate.ly are.

We even studied spelling and grammar in school (maybe not as much as we should have studied).  However, most of us do not know the origins of the language, how it has changed over the centuries, or its variants around the globe.  Today, English is used by more people in India than in the United Kingdom and the United States combined.  So, whose English is authoritative and why?  I am not saying it is not the Queen's English that is not the standard of our language, I am just pointing out that there is room for discussion and reconsideration.<br /><br />David Crystal has provided an amply illustrated journey through English that begins with considerations of what a model of English might look like and then takes us through a fascinating history of our language from the Old English through today's World English.  Part II provides five chapters on the vocabulary and lexicon of English.  Part III tackles the knotty problem of English grammar.  Part IV discusses spoken and written English, Part V talks about the varieties of using English by region, societal variation, and even personal variation.  Part VI talks about learning and studying English.  The appendices are full of useful information such as a glossary, references, further reading list, index, and so forth.<br /><br />The book is worth having just for the concise history it provides the English language, but the other discussions are worth knowing about and considering the various points of view the author provides us.  As always, it is not necessary to agree with everything provided by a scholar to benefit from what he provides us.  Just wrestling with the ideas and clarifying why you disagree with this or that point, or digging deeper to gain a richer understanding than the author provides are certainly worthwhile benefits to be gained.<br /><br />An excellent read and reference for your bookshelf.	2005-07-26

Every person who is concerned about taxes should read this concise and clearly written book.  Steve Forbes has put forward a plan that will help every one of us by making our economy more efficient, make competition in the marketplace more even and fair (because being well connected with lobbyists would lose its power to get you a special break), and would make our representatives more directly accountable for what they spend because it would be more clear to each of us what it is we pay into the Washington D.C. sinkhole.<br /><br />Every now and again it is essential to not just overhaul the tax code, but to wipe it out completely and start over.  This happens because those whose job it is to spend the money eventually realize that the more money they have to spend the greater their power.  They grant the money to those who support them, to retain popularity with their constituents, and to make those who receive payments beholden to them.  They learn to collect the money as indirectly as possible so there is no general opposition to this or that small increase while there is a very vocal special interest group that wants the payment and hires lobbyists and supports the campaign costs of those who get them those payments.<br /><br />The whole code becomes impenetrable with exceptions, loopholes, and one-offs.  For example, Mr. Forbes points out a couple of times that Starbucks, your local caffeine purveyor, has gotten Congress to grant it a special exemption as a MANUFACTURER so it can get a special tax break on the grounds (sorry) that it grinds coffee beans.  Right.  There are thousands of these special favors built into the code.  How does that help the consumer?  Starbucks should have to compete against every other coffee company on an equal footing and that will get the customers the best prices, products, and services.<br /><br />This optimistic book takes us on a quick trip through the present monstrosity, the benefits to America that a Flat Tax will bring, compares it to a national sales tax, shows the experience of other countries who have a flat tax, and then gives the reader the information he or she needs to go out and make a difference to get this done.  Mr. Forbes provides contact information for contacting your elected officials in Washington and some leading organizations concerned with tax reform.  He provides contact information for national radio shows and other information to help you get up to speed about what else is being offered in the name of tax reform.  Other flat tax proposals are also compared.  Mr. Forbes also talks about how a Flat Tax combined with Health Savings Accounts will free most of us from being bound to our elected officials and the threat of becoming devastated if a job change is forced on you.<br /><br />This is a terrific book and reads like fresh air breathes.  I hope you will read it, tell your friends about it, and that it will generate a great deal of INFORMED discussion rather than the deafening roar of those who benefit from the present system and don't want it changed so they simply shout down the voices for change.  Remember, the buggy whip makers, horse breeders, wagon makers, and many other industries all went away and the workers found more efficient and often more gainful employment.  Deploying intelligent and literate workers who now argue over interpretations of the volumes of the tax law into more productive work will not only help them, it will help you.<br /><br />Let's do it!sales tax, shows the experience of other countries who have a flat tax, and then gives the reader the information he or she needs to go out and make a difference to get this done.

When a book can provide that, I don't know what more you could ask for.  My first experience of eating ribs was as a boy at my father's union picnic.  When they told me I could eat some ribs, I did not want to eat them.  Once I tasted them, I could not get enough.  For a while, I looked for every opportunity to find more of this magical delicacy.  Then I ran into some tough, dried out, vein laden stuff that put me off it for quite awhile.<br /><br />Even so, I am not sure that what I ate was barbecue even though that is what it was called in the world of my youth.  I suspect that for many people if you cook something over an open flame or  charcoal and put sauce on it, that is barbecue, barbeque, BBQ or whatever else you want to call it.  It wasn't until I read Calvin Trillin's wonderful writing on his favorite food in Kansas City, Missouri that I realized there was a difference between my cooking out back over charcoal in a Weber Smoker and the slowly cooked, low temperature, super tender barbecue.  It was not until very recently that I have tasted whole hog barbecue cooked in a pit over wood and it makes all the difference in my appreciation of this great food.<br /><br />I bought this book at a special barbecue evening at Zingerman's Roadhouse here in Ann Arbor and one of the authors, Lolis Eric Elie, was there to talk with us about what he had found, what we were eating, his book, and his DVD.  It was such an impressive evening that I wanted to read what he had to say.<br /><br />The authors took me on a wonderful adventure.  I got to follow them from Memphis and meandering through Arkansas, Texas, Missouri, both Carolinas, Chicago, and others.  They found a lot of bad cooking along the way, but they found some good to wonderful barbecue as well.  The interesting thing to me is that there is no real predictor of when they were going to find something great.  Some of the tiny places out back were good, most were bad.  Some of the larger establishments were good, most were not.<br /><br />What you had to have was a pit master who cared, who knew what he was doing, and who was willing to do the time consuming work to make it happen.  The authors also show us a wide range of preparations of meats.  Mostly it is pork, except in Texas where it is beef.  In some places it is just ribs and brisket, others it is the whole hog.<br /><br />A few still cook it in a pit in the ground, most have above ground pits of brick and sand and some with steel.  One pitmaster argued that steel wrecks the meat, but most cook that way.  There are those that use indirect heat and smoke.  There are others who want the flame and the burning of the grease drippings.  The most successful use good wood or charcoal.  Although they did find one place that barbecued with electric heat and a strip of wood for smokey flavoring.  The worst whole hog was a place that used gas and nothing to put any flavor in.<br /><br />There are places that specialize in different things.  Some do the pork shoulder, some are ribs and brisket, and some cook the whole hog.  Some even do chicken and shrimp, but the authors dismiss these as not being barbecue because the only thing they have in common is the sauce and a touch of flame.  No slow cooking or smoking.<br /><br />I can tell you that I wished I were with the authors at a few of the places to sample the food with them.  However, I do not believe I am quite adventurous enough to want to seek out snoot sandwiches or ear sandwiches.  And while I have had pork rinds, I have not had cracklins.  I assume they are different.  It was also very interesting to me how much of what you ate as a child biased you as to what barbecue is.  Frank loved the ribs from Chicago even though they weren't cooked like traditional barbecue, weren't as tender as \\"real\\" barbecue, but were nonetheless tasty as all get out.<br /><br />Among the many delights of this book are the fabulous pictures taken by one of the authors.  They show so much.  Wonderful people who are full of character and life.  Frank Stewart caught so much of the atmosphere of the places the authors take us to that I felt in some ways that I have been there.<br /><br />The book also supplies many recipes that were acquired in the travels and hard won sampling of the nation's barbecue.  These are the good stuff.  Frank and Lolis also provide us with the addresses of their favorite places.hors.  They show so much.  Wonderful people who are full of character and life.

First, it provides information that refutes the popular notion of the past several years that Pope Pius XII was an anti-Semite and complicit with the Nazi Regime.  He demonstrates it to be not only false, but a deliberate misrepresentation of the truth.  A simple example is the famous photograph on the jacket of both the English and American editions of the Pope leaving what looks like a Nazi meeting.  In fact, it was a diplomatic meeting with Hindenburg in 1927!  Both before the Nazis were in power and before Pacelli had been elected Pope.<br /><br />This book provides evidence upon evidence of how Pope Pius XII walked a swaying tightrope to save thousands of Jews while avoiding provoking the Nazis into attacks upon Catholics.  He wrote encyclicals, gave Jews asylum even to the point of decloistering a nunnery so it could shelter Jewish boys.  The author also points out the use by these authors of bad translations of texts and then carefully trimming these to twist the meaning to their purposes.  Rabbi Dalin also demonstrates the good relations that Pope Pius and the Church had with Jewish leaders and how those leaders even asked the Pope to not be more provocative in his public statements and actions.<br /><br />Second, the author demonstrates how these authors have as part of their agenda an attack on the Catholic Church and are using political means to try and foist their liberal agenda on the Church in all sorts of ways: changes in doctrine, changes in Church governance, changes in policy and all to the purpose of bending others to their views.  We see their double standards in purporting anti-Semitism onto Pope Pius XII while ignoring the very real and very great anti-Semitism in the Muslim world from WWII to the present.  Some of these authors have even supported the political motives of Yassir Arafat and denied his self-proclaimed anti-Semitism and acts of violence against Jews.<br /><br />The third benefit flows from the first two.  We get a better sense of where some of the battle lines are drawn in our present culture wars, the tactics being used, and in the service of what strategy.  It is fascinating to see the inversion of values in our modern culture where what was called good is now called false and deviant and what never was good or an ideal is now held up as a virtue worth fighting for.  Rabbi Dalin does us all a service by telling the truth in this concise and informative book.third benefit flows from the first two.

This book is by ten term US Congressman Curt Weldon, who represents a district in Pennsylvania.  Yes, he is a Republican.  He also sits on several committees involved with intelligence, and military matters.  As vice-chairman of the Armed Services Committee and he has a degree in Russian Studies.<br /><br />While serving in his duties he came in contact with a source that he feels has been very credible in providing important intelligence about Iran's motives, behaviors, and intentions.  He notes that he was more than dubious at first, but after several of this source's statements panned out he brought him into contact with the CIA.  The CIA, for unstated reasons, was uninterested.  More than that, they worked to undermine this source's credibility.  Further investigation by Congressman Weldon proved the CIA explanation as incorrect.<br /><br />This book provides a chapter of introduction and explanation by the author, Congressman Weldon, and then the bulk of the book's chapters provide an introduction by the author and reproductions of memos sent to Mr. Weldon.  There is also a final chapter that provides the author's summary of what has been provided and what needs to happen in the future.  It is fair to say that Mr. Weldon is no fan of the bureaucracy within the CIA that resists change and has sought to actively undermine the Bush administration.  This resistance continues to this day.<br /><br />So, by reading this book, if you believe it (it rings true to me but I have no way to verify anything the author says), you will get real insight into our pitiful efforts at intelligence, amazing insight into the hard line Iranian government and what they seek to do to harm the US and undermine our efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq, and what Iran has tried to plan to harm us within our own borders.<br /><br />Some have dismissed the book.  However, those folks have their own agenda and disagree with the direction and recommendation Mr. Weldon outlines in this book.  If you support the Bush administration, as I do, you will find this book alarming.  The author wants to spark a national discussion and have us become actively involved in demanding that our government overhauls and improves our intelligence capability in order to better protect us from those who do mean us harm.  Iran is not our friend and cannot be coaxed to stop its strenuous and multifaceted efforts against America by having a conversation with its tyrants over tea and biscuits.<br /><br />Read it and decide for yourself.d what Iran has tried to plan to harm us within our own borders.

The huge increase in design schools, engineering schools, and business schools around the world promise that competition will become ever more fierce.  Cost cutting alone will not get the job done because only one company in each segment can be the low cost producer.  It is innovation that allows for many competitors and increased profits.  That is why so many books and schools talk about innovation.  However, it is very difficult to teach someone to be creative.<br /><br />Many try to take a riskless and incremental approach to innovation and while that is better than the status quo it leaves one vulnerable to the competitions better efforts.  However, the risk in wandering into more ambiguous areas of your business for innovation make management uncomfortable and if done wrong can lead to a swift demise.  Hence, it is often avoided by successful companies.  We have seen the automotive companies remove billions upon billions from their cost structure and they are still in trouble.  It is finding innovation that customers will not only buy, but also pay MORE for that is the Holy Grail of modern business.<br /><br />This book proposes what the authors call Pragmatic Innovation as a way to choose wisely which Grail you drink from.  For them this is a form of innovation that includes interdisciplinary collaboration, a structured process of exploration, a balance between art and science, a focus on experimentation and fantasy, and to this I will add good luck.  It is always that feel for how much line to let out and how much tension to use to reign in without things either breaking or getting away from you that make the difference.  How can that be communicated?  It certainly can't be put into a checklist.<br /><br />The broad range of case studies offered in this book help.  We look at diesel fuel additives, vegetable peelers, pickup-truck seating, computerized running shoes, and a lot more.  In laying out the ground rules for the innovator their point three is my favorite: Don't Stop At Success.  And that is an important imperative in the contemporary environment.<br /><br />This is a solid book and offers a lot of food for thought.  Of course you are unlikely to agree with or use everything here.  However, if you can pick up a few ideas that spark your creativity and give you a new path it will have been well worth the read.the ground rules for the innovator their point three is my favorite: Don't Stop At Success.

Frankly, the attacks on this book are wildly off base and unjustified.  If this book were about anyone other than Hillary Clinton none of what is said here would amount to a \\"vicious lie\\" or \\"attack journalism\\" as others have characterized it.  In fact, most of what is here is collected from news stories, other books, and television reports.  Other interviews were conducted and several of them are unnamed, but so what?<br /><br />Some well respected journalists have made entire careers disparaging certain politicians with unnamed sources.  The public is certainly able to weigh and judge what is credible and what is ridiculous.  Howard Kurtz of the Washington Post rightly points out the double standard in the media in the way Kitty Kelly's much trashier book on the Bush family was given vast air play and how this book was given the silent treatment.<br /><br />Since this book does get on the personal side of Hillary's life, I can see how some conservatives would run from it because of the way the Clinton attack team uses any statement unapproved by them as an excuse to savage all Republicans and to wrap themselves in the sackcloth of the terribly wronged victim.  But the Clinton ploy is completely unjustified.  When have they respected the private life of anyone?  What about the treatment they gave all the women who dared comment on their treatment by Bill?  If you speak against the Clintons everything about your life and the life of anyone you care about is fair game.<br /><br />Among the many problems that all politicians have is this, they all play a kind of theatrical game because they have to appeal to such a large base to win.  They cannot be a real person and be that broadly appealing.  So, they use lights, smoke, and mirrors to present a crafted image of themselves.  For some, creating an appealing image is more difficult.  Hillary falls into this category.  Whenever anyone presents unapproved information about her she feels that her carefully built house of cards is vulnerable and she attacks like a famished shark.<br /><br />This book takes us backstage, as it were, and of course it has to be portrayed as a horrible and partisan smear campaign even though the author has absolutely NOTHING to do with the GOP or any conservative group.  As a thought experiment: what is more true about, say, Jay Leno, the on camera Tonight Show Jay, or the guy in his office getting ready for the show?  Or the Jay at home with his wife and cars?  Each is true in its own way and a serious debate could be made about what access the public should have to the \\"real Jay\\".<br /><br />However, since our government officials have such a profound effect on our lives, unlike Jay Leno, the public has wanted to know more and more about the real candidate.  Dick Morris, of all people, has called for a zone of privacy.  But how can that be provided Presidential candidates?  Why should we have to accept the artificial version of the candidate mounted by the campaign or the equally misshapen version put forward by their opposition?  I think many people want to get to the real person underneath, warts and all.  Especially when the person is as controversial with so many public versions of themselves as Hillary Clinton has floating around.<br /><br />This book does talk about her success as a Senator.  It also puts the lie to her claim that she did not know about Bill's affairs.  And it asks some questions about why she stays with Bill even though they are seldom together and he has become more reckless with his affairs.  It is not a rehash of Whitewater or all the familiar stuff.  It spends more time with her as a high school student and a radical at Wellesley.  I was also glad to know more about her work to impeach Richard Nixon.  When peeling back the layers, we need to know this stuff to get at what makes Hillary tick.<br /><br/>When we see the background staff and their machinations we see clearly that she has not become more conservative or even centrist.  This book shows clearly that it is all a pose to make her attractive to the broad electorate.  And while that is all fair politics, I wonder why so few have felt the need to go after this when it is always asked about anyone from the GOP.<br /><br />I think this book is one voice in the debate about who the real Hillary is and I am glad to have read it.  If the \\"mainstream press\\" doesn't like it, then let them put forward a serious critique of this soon-to-be Presidential Candidate rather than producing yet another puff piece for their anointed one.<br /><br />To use their worn out phrase, \\"The Public Has A Right to Know\\"./>When we see the background staff and their machinations we see clearly that she has not become more conservative or even centrist.

There are those who claim that those who are born with superior natural endowments owe a portion of their gift to those less able.  The problem begins.  Who defines what is superior?  Who defines what is owed to whom?  How much is owed?  What is equal?<br /><br />The four essays are:  The Quest for Cosmic Justice, The Mirage of Equality, The Tyranny of Visions, and The Quest for Repeal of the American Revolution.<br /><br />None of these argues for the huge disparities between the rich and poor as goods.  Rather, it argues against some arbitrary elite imposing its vision of equality on everyone else.  It was Milton Friedman who advocated the negative income tax.  The poor would be provided for without the creation of a huge state bureaucracy with the attendant political machinations.  However, it is the growth of the state and its control of the population that its proponents actually desire.  They crave the power to decide and impose.<br /><br />The last essay focuses on the way our Constitution is being subverted by those who take to themselves the right to be the conscience of others.  Sowell quotes a speech by Lincoln that warns us against those who are not content to carry on what was built by others.  They wish to take the law to themselves.  The author notes that in the French Revolution a mission was appointed to go about the country righting wrongs and then offers a quote by Chief Justice Earl Warren not asking if something follows the Constitution, but whether it is just or right.<br /><br />It isn't that these folks intend to directly overthrow the Constitution, it is that their disregard for laws (rules known in advance) or the processes laid out to change those laws in order to gratify their own attitudes and views is incompatible with the American system of government.  And we are now reaping the whirlwind.  Property laws have been weakened for more than a century were recently all but erased by a fiasco of a ruling by the Supreme Court.<br /><br />My admiration for Thomas Sowell runs deep and I commend this book to everyone.d.

Wonderful tribute to those who fought in 1776	This book is a terrific read and provides an important telling of the fateful years of 1775 and particularly of 1776.  McCullough always keeps things moving, but with the eye for the details that bring the story to life and never clutters up his narrative with fussy anecdotes or distracting debate.  He gets to the heart of the story and tells it with pride in the American story and what was suffered and accomplished in those years.<br /><br />McCullough is fair to England and George III.  He is able to show us why the English felt they were being reasonable and how the rebellion was not only illegal, but insulting as well.  I especially enjoyed how the author shows us the power of the English army and navy compared to the militias attached to General Washington.  The English and Hessian mercenaries are never shown as fools or inadequate.  In fact, it is Washington who is shown to be indecisive and who makes a few key errors.<br /><br />It is also clear that support for separation from England was far from universal in the colonies.  There was even treachery within the ranks of the officers of the forces under Washington's leadership.  And where there wasn't treachery, each setback fostered second guessing and dissention.<br /><br />The army reached its peak of more than 20,000 soldiers during the summer of 1776.  After the setbacks during the New York campaign and with winter coming on, Washington commanded around 3,000 inadequately supplied troops.  Many of these men were without shoes and none had adequate ammunition.  Yet, they marched on.<br /><br />McCullough rightly shows how it was the determination of these 3,000 men who simply would not quit that made all the difference.  Our founding was not inevitable.  It wasn't the product of social or historical forces.  It was during the bleak times during the fall of 1776 that Thomas Paine wrote those immortal words in The Crisis, \\"These are the times that try men's souls\\".  It was in those opening paragraphs where he contrasted the summer soldiers who had made such a large army right after the Declaration of Independence in July and August with the sparse few winter soldiers who tenaciously carried on their work in the cold and deprivation far away from their families and homes.<br /><br />Every American would benefit from reading this book and I hope they all do.  There is so much here to help us all appreciate our founding and all the blessings we enjoy which flow from the resolve of all those who made us a nation.iers who had made such a large army right after the Declaration of Independence in July and August with the sparse few winter soldiers who tenaciously carried on their work in the cold and deprivation far away from their families and homes.

It is written by a Roman Emperor and is a book of introspective philosophy rather than a publication of his public acts or justifications for his career.  Although it was written in the Christian era, it is clearly a non-Christian work and that makes it very interesting as well.  One of the problems we have understanding such a work is that our culture, though largely post-Christian nowadays, is rooted in and permeated by Christian concepts and institutions.  Be careful as you read this book to not let your present-day mindset fool you into thinking you understand what this mind from a different world of almost 2,000 years ago wrote.<br /><br />The book is arranged in chapters - what we would call paragraphs.  And books - that we would call chapters.  They were written at different times and not meant to be a coherent statement of the author's beliefs.  Often, they seem to be advice to himself.<br /><br />About one-half of this book is notes to help the reader understand what Marcus Aurelius wrote.  This is quite necessary, because it is so easy to get off on the wrong track by misreading what is actually being said in this austere and often quite strange book.<br /><br />Yet, it has a nice payoff in helping the reader see the world a bit differently and to bring that portion of the history of the Roman Empire to life.	2005-07-06

This wonderful volume from the Library of America provides his major writings in one volume.  Knowing these works is important to your understanding of what ideas were in circulation at the time of our founding and what was being debated on both sides of the Atlantic.<br /><br />\\"Common Sense\\" takes on the idea of monarchy and of American Independence with arguments that amount to no more than common sense.  Paine takes apart the idea that monarchy comes from God using the logic of the current English constitution and its internal checks wondering why a form that comes from God would need such a check.  As for American Independence, he points out that a small island might need protection from a greater power, but why would a continent need protection from a small island.  He also points out that our previous dependence on Britain is not reason to continue the relationship.  Children begin as helpless babes, but do not drink milk forever.  The time inevitably comes when the child must take its place in the world as an independent adult.  There is much more to his arguments, but this gives you a sense of how he argues.  This tract was printed many times and made a huge noise in the world.<br /><br />\\"The Crisis\\" or \\"The American Crisis\\" is a series that reports on aspects of the War for Independence that began in December of 1776 when things were not going all that well for the Americans.  The first in this series begins with the famous sentence, \\"These are the times that try men's souls.\\"  And goes on about the summer and winter soldier.<br /><br />\\"The Rights of Man\\" is Paine's argument for the French Revolution and specifically taking on the arguments of Edmund Burke against what was going on in France after their Revolution.  In my view, Paine is pretty much off the rails here, especially when he lists the rights declared by the French.  For example, compare number three of these declarations with the American notion that man is sovereign whose rights are given him by God.  The French say, \\"The nation is essentially the source of all sovereignty; nor can any INDIVIDUAL, or ANY BODY OF MEN, be entitled to any authority which is not expressly derived from it.\\"  Oy.  Anybody see tyranny justified in that one?<br /><br />In  \\"The Age of Reason\\" Paine takes on sectarian religion and all orthodox Christianity, which Paine does not like.  He advocates a Deism as superior to all religions.  Sigh.<br /><br />Anyway, these are important essays and had a big impact in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries and are a part of our history.

Even if you aren't in the media, your professional dealings are judged according to those standards.  We all have to perform at a higher level because of what we have all seen on television and read in the press.  This is where Jerry Weissman and \\"In the Line of Fire\\" come in.<br /><br />Using examples from Presidential politics that are familiar to all of us, Mr. Weissman teaches solid lessons on how to handle yourself when asked tough questions under pressure.  It is a short book so you can digest its contents and put them into practice.  This is a practical book rather than a book of theory.  He first shows us where the dangers are, how our instincts and natural reactions can trap us, and what is really going on in these situations.<br /><br />He then shows us how to learn to instinctively decode what is actually happening during the questioning and how to find the part of the question that isn't loaded so that you can reframe it and answer it without blowing yourself up.  He also provides techniques for retaking the floor.  There are more advanced techniques that can be used who have mastered the basics and feel comfortable using them, but he warns against using them without mastery.<br /><br />I think it is a very useful book with some very solid points.  Since we all know that we are likely to face a tough and even unfair grilling during our professional lives, it makes sense to get prepared and to practice sound and easy to master techniques that will help us win those exchanges.	2005-06-29

Rich Lowry, who is the editor-in-chief of \\"National Review\\", has written a very fine summary of those years.  It is NOT an attack piece or a hatchet job.  In fact, it is a simple, clearly written well documented recounting of what the Clintons did and where that leaves us in the world.<br /><br />It shows a very small presidency, driven by ideology, constantly campaigning instead of governing, and distracted by scandal after scandal.  Lowry does not deny the political gifts the Clintons clearly posses.  He also never gives in to fringe theories (he refers to the Vince Foster was murdered theories as on the paranoid fringe of the right) or loses his way in the minutia of this or that event.  Lowry keeps things moving and focused on the main events of the 2 for 1 Presidency and casts them in a natural rather than lurid light.<br /><br />And the two terms of Clinton come out from behind the curtain as much smaller than their media image as the great and powerful wizards.<br /><br />The book has thirteen chapters divided into three parts: Politics & Policy, Scandal & the Law, and Foreign Policy.  It is true Lowry comes from the Regan Republican point of view and little of what he says will be blessed by the Paul Begala - James Carville wing of true believers.  However, Lowry does take on both sides of the political aisle and the Republicans come away wearing a number of darts for the things they did to enable the Clintons and when they drifted away from conservative orthodoxy.<br /><br />If you want to read a recounting of the Clinton years that is conservative in outlook and never gives in to sensationalism, this is a great choice and at a terrific price.	2005-06-28
191787:US	53052943	R2C55WAG2S2VNQ	0060840978	613843772	How We Got Here: A Slightly Irreverent History of Technology and Markets	Books	5	33	34	N	N	Entertaining stories that teach principles of economic growth	In his last book, \\"Running Money\\" Andy Kessler underscored his arguments with breezy historical accounts that demonstrated the quirks of history and what made the industrial revolution go.  \\"How We Got Here\\" is a book length version of that history and pulls it more fully what has been happening to intellectual property and capital markets during the past decade.<br /><br />Kessler tells these stories because he wants his readers to understand the importance of intellectual property, of scaling those ideas to serve the needs of large populations, and of free flowing capital markets to find and support the best ideas.  A by-product of these is lower prices for everyone, which leads to an increased standard of living.  The author notes that he wishes he had been taught these things as a young man, and I agree that every young person (and everyone else, for that matter) will be better off taking these ideas into their bones.  Why?  Because we human beings don't always understand specific events all that well.  We need broader principles to see our local life as part of a larger whole and the principles that are governing what is happening.  Our untrained instincts are quite bad in assessing statistical outcomes (hence the thriving business of casinos).<br /><br />This is a very entertaining read.  It is similar to James Burke's famous \\"Connections\\", but this actually has a more focused purpose that Mr. Burke's wonderful vignettes. Kessler is strongest at the end when he is telling about the development of our computer based world because he is talking from his personal experience.  Not only does he bring the world of Wall Street into sharp focus, he demonstrates the role of the military in funding the development the networks we use everyday.<br /><br />For me, the thing I would hope readers would take away from this book is how unpredictable the future is and how things come along that confound all experts, bureaucrats (whether private or public), and projections.

It is a handbook of how to build your business so that it can compete in today's hyperspeed marketplace.<br /><br />The problem is this, if you build a retail business that is successful, others can copy and remove your ability to grow into a distant market before you are even ready to get there.  Worse, they can actually start growing their business with your proven format and cut you off at the knees.<br /><br />Arthur Rubinfeld is the guy who helped put a Starbucks on every corner in your hometown, so he knows about market research, understanding the geographic markets and statistical markets in each state and city.  He knows about location, financing, marketing, merchandising, and everything else and he puts it in this book to help you understand what you are facing and what you need to do.  I particularly liked his discussions of connecting design and brand and of customizing customer service.<br /><br />Obviously, growing too fast can kill you just as fast as doing nothing, so the idea is to figure out how to do it right and execute the proper plan with speed, skill, focus, and intensity.  Rubinfeld lays it all out in this book and his co-author, Collins Hemingway, put it into clear and understandable prose.<br /><br />Good information for retail warriors!	2005-06-24

Did the leaders hear only support and agreement from their staff?  Did the leaders cut off debate and competition with a premature \\"no\\"?  Ah, you have been through organizational horror as well.<br /><br />This book is a great primer that will help you understand healthy internal competition and disagreement.  Prof. Roberto also explains why consensus is not and does not require unanimity of opinion.  The consensus he describes is deeper and more communicative than an agreement that is mouthed and enforced with a mind numbing going-through-the-motions initiative.<br /><br />The author has examined data from many organizations and illustrates his points with anecdotes from corporate life and also uses historical events to make his points.  I admit there were a few times that his simple telling of the stories bothered me just a bit (for example, comparing Kennedy's failed Bay of Pigs management style versus his improved and successful management style for the Missile Crisis.  Right ...).<br /><br />This is a helpful book for anyone who has to lead teams of people from a small group to a large organization.  Roberto has many lists of questions you can ask yourself as you work to develop your own approach to these issues.  I do like his notions around stimulating the clash of ideas.  However, I think that his using the word \\"indecision\\" as a positive thing is wrong.  What he means is that the leader must not provide a premature \\"no\\".  He has to let ideas compete, let time settle some of the debate.  He has to manage such competition so that it is healthy and doesn't grow into a destructive force.  The word \\"indecision\\" implies no such skill or control.<br /><br />That quibble aside, this is a solid and helpful book for young people taking on leadership roles, or anyone interested in thinking through the dynamics of vitality within an organization.inking through the dynamics of vitality within an organization.	2005-06-24

This terrific book takes on every PC misconception about them and sets the record straight.  While never presenting them is marble pillars of morality, the author puts all of the issues in their proper context and demonstrates clearly the intelligence, morality, and rightness of our founders.<br /><br />One of the most famous of the old canards that you will still hear is that the founders only considered slaves to be 3/5 of a human being because it says so right there in the Constitution.  How sad that misunderstanding and misrepresentation is.  Because each state was given a number of representatives based upon the number of residents, the issue was whom do you count.  You have to first ask yourself whom the representatives from the slave holding states would represent.  The slaves?  Of course not!<br /><br />So, if the rights of the slaves were not going to be protected, to give their slaveholders the ability to count those slaves as people and thereby become over-represented in Congress would actually work against interests of those people trapped in slavery.  Those opposing slavery wanted the slaves to remain uncounted for representation.  The slaveholders wanted them to count as a full person (does that mean the slaveholders cared about the human rights of the slaves more than the abolitionists?).  The compromise was to count them as 3/5.  However, it is essential to remember that those who wanted the slaves counted as a whole person were uninterested in the rights of those human beings and those that wanted them uncounted actually had the interests of the slaves more in mind.<br /><br />Professor West also takes on the issues of property rights, who had the right to vote and why, women and their rights at the time of the revolution, poverty, and immigration.<br /><br />A good and informative read.  Every student should read it as an antidote to the misinformation they get during their indoctrination at the public schools.  This book will actually aid their education and help them develop a solid understanding of what is really at stake in our country.  And it might spark some lively debate when they go to class armed with some information the teacher will likely find inconvenient or even bewildering.  One of my daughters actually had to go to the blackboard and explain the 3/5 issue carefully to the teacher and class.  The teacher commented that she had never thought of it that way before.

It is hard to get the truth about anything anymore in any of the popular media.  This book is put out by the Naval Institute Press and is a complete, scholarly, unemotional, objective, and horrifying recounting of what our men suffered in Southeast Asian Prison Camps from 1961 - 1973.<br /><br />The book takes us through the various prisons by their geographic location and their time period with photographs and unflinching text.  It is very clear about the development and progress of the torture and when it finally declined.  It explains the treatment of all PWs and singles out some for individual and extended treatment.  There are many photographs of these men, so many of them heroes, and diagrams of the tortures they endured.  It also talks about the early releases and the pressure put on some (like John McCain) to leave out of order.<br /><br />One of the things the PWs did in captivity was commit the names of all the prisoners to memory, included those who died in captivity.  These lists of names were considered sacred.  This book lists the PWs at the end of the book by name with their service, capture date, release date, and status.  It is indeed a sacred list and we would all do well to read it and ponder what it means.<br /><br />There are many notes, a full biography, and an index.<br /><br />Stuart Rochester and Frederick Kiley have performed a great service for us with this book.	2005-06-24

Because he reports without an agenda, those who have a vested interest in a certain point of view (whether emotional or monetary) attack him in all kinds of ways.  When you examine the criticisms you will see that they all fail.  For example, a New York Times review of this book tries the old canard that most of what is here has been reported before.  Right.  So, the average reader is supposed to look up thousands of news articles and hundreds of books to get a handle on what Mr. Posner provides for us here so concisely and clearly in about 225 pages (including end notes)?<br /><br /> That review also admitted that Posner was breaking new ground in his reporting of the Saudi ruling powers' plan for destroying their oil wells if their power is ever challenged.  When you read this book I am sure the chapter on the Petro SE (scorched earth) report will be fascinating and disturbing.  While no one knows if the intelligence intercepted is real or false information the Saudi's wanted believed, it has crucial implications for the world economy if such a loss of oil production capacity were to occur.<br /><br />The bottom line is that unless you are an expert on Saudi politics you do not know what is in this book and it is in your interest to know this stuff.  So, I believe you will want to get a hold of this book and read it.<br /><br />The title refers not to tabloid sensationalism but to the fact that the rulers of Saudi Arabia are extremely closed and operate in secrecy as opaque as their money, power, and influence can provide.  Their public statements and the actions they take are for managing their image and have little to do with what they say and do behind the scenes.<br /><br />The author carefully explains the very recent and somewhat strange origins of the house of Saud with its ties to Wahhabi fundamentalist Islam from its very beginnings.  With the rise of importance of oil in the twentieth century, Saudi Arabia has also had a deep internal conflict.  How to be involved with the Western world - viewed by them as Crusaders, no less - and still remain true to their extreme vision of a pure Islam.<br /><br />On one hand, they want the power and wealth from the oil, but they want to keep the world out.  They need the Western world to help them extract the oil, but they want to spread a primitive vision of Islam around the globe using the power and wealth the oil gives them.  They insist on a program of education for their population that has a deeply racist view of the entire non-Muslim world, but many in the royal family live their lives outside the kingdom in deep hypocrisy (booze, women, gambling, and wasteful spending).  They also depend on the wealth and power of their ties with the West to keep the family of Saud in power, yet their fostering of Islamist fundamentalism also brings unrest and challenge to the Royal Family.  You can see the 6,000 Princes of Saud are a portrait self-opposition.  Posner does a fine job of showing us the subtleties of all these internal contradictions.<br /><br />Americans should also be concerned about what their government keeps from them to protect the House of Saud.  Their investments in the United States are not only not reported by our government (by an agreement reached with our government to be treated as an exception), the Saudi's also invest through complicated and secretive chains of corporate offshore entities.  Posner says that one reasonable estimate of their holdings is around $600 billion.  Of course, what else are they going to do with all the dollars we and others ship them for their oil?  They have to put them somewhere.  Are we better off having them here or elsewhere?  Still, it is disquieting that our government helps keep this information from us.  We have learned by sad experience that secrecy and opaqueness seldom lead to good ends.  Transparency and openness are healthy and in the interests of our citizenry.  We should insist that the Saudi's acquisitions and spending in our economy be accounted for openly so the American Citizens can make proper assessments for themselves on whether they are good for us or if some other course of action should be taken.<br /><br />The extent of the Saudi's support for the other side in our War on Terror is also complex.  Many Saudi's do not recognize their own role in fostering 9/11.  In fact, many still believe and promote the idea that America attacked itself that awful day to support the Zionists.  Sure, it is a crazy notion, however, it is a notion that is believed by powerful people.  We simply dismiss this to our own hurt.<br /><br />In his previous book (also strongly recommended), \\"Why America Slept\\", Posner reported on the capture and interrogation of Abu Zubaydah.  He opens this book with a recap of this incident and reports on the amazing coincidental deaths of all those named by Zubaydah as contacts.  They died on the operating table, in plane crashes, and car accidents.  Make of it what you will.  However, it is clear that Islamic charities are not charities in the Western sense and that money flows from Saudi Arabia into channels that are used by those who oppose us.  Not because the Saudi's are hoodwinked, but because ideologically the Saudi's are indeed in opposition to us.  We have to face the fact that while we need their oil and they want our money and much else, we are not aligned in all interests, views, or purposes.  Nevertheless, they have also, at times, taken heat in the Arab world doing things to help the United States, as well.  While they may not be our direct enemy, they are certainly not our unqualified friends.<br /><br />Posner does a superb job in presenting these complex realities.  He does not pull punches, and he demonstrates how all American administrations and both political parties have participated in accommodating the Saudis.  Most disturbing are the names Posner provides of prominent Americans who have profited and continue to profit from supporting Saudi interests in the US.  It is disturbing because the work these paid agents are doing would not be perceived by the average American as being in America's interests.  Maybe they could be persuaded if someone trusted them with the facts, however, it is treated as a public relations problem with massive lobbyist support and complicit efforts to keep the true scope of the Saudi impact on our economy secret.<br /><br />I also urge you to read the footnotes.  There are lists of names of prominent Saudi's donating to terrorist groups and a lot of other great information in these notes.  Posner also provides a very useful bibliography for further reading.the Saudi's acquisitions and spending in our economy be accounted for openly so the American Citizens can make proper assessments for themselves on whether they are good for us or if some other course of action should be taken.

It is the history of the Pacific Ocean for the past 400 years.  It is surprising what that involves because so many nations from all around the world made strenuous efforts to control, colonize, and conquer so many places along its continental coasts and its many islands.  It also involves many different indigenous cultures and a hugely changing political scene.<br /><br />One of the reasons I love the book is Walter McDougall's lively and engaging writing style.  This is a book of solid scholarship, but it is full of art as well.  One of the problems facing anyone who would write such a history is how to tell it in a coherent way.  McDougall came up with a brilliant literary solution.  He has the author dream the key characters in periodic conversations about the events under consideration with the Hawiian Kaahumanu as the central and governing center of the wheel.  Reading this book was a real pleasure for me.  I read a lot and widely, and this book was a special pleasure.<br /><br />It begins in 1565 with early European exploration of the Pacific and ends just after the Second World War and ends with a bunch of questions, ponderables, the author calls them, about the 1990s.  Some of them seem to have been acted on, but many issues continue to this day and some new ones could be added to the list.  Along the way there is the settling of Alaska, of Russian ambition, of Japans rise from its isolation to become a military empire, of China, of Spain, of the rise of America and Canada.  It is a story of commerce, religion, culture, and of great violence.  Hugely dramatic and very informative.<br /><br />I know it will seem unlike any other history you have ever read.  And that is only one of its many virtues.	2005-06-21

Nor is it one of those books that sensationalize a vice while only pretending to condemn it.  This is a book about the state of our culture and how traditional morality has not only been abandoned, but is being actively attacked.  In fact, in many cases the ideas of chastity and fidelity are being identified as part of the problem in American culture!<br /><br />The author of \\"Porn Generation\\" is a young man of 21 who takes his religion and its teachings on morality very seriously.  He discusses frankly the state of our culture and the ways in which our young people are being exploited and sexualized for commercial and political interests.  It is pathetic that the huge corporations that own the major networks and so many cable channels hide behind the idea that they peddle immorality because they need to pander to the tastes of the public in order to compete.  Actually, standards have sunk so far that now they simply say they are reflecting normal behavior.  They aren't, but that is what they would have you believe.<br /><br />Ben Shapiro also exposes the social - political agenda of many organizations and the hold they have gotten over our schools.  It is beyond shocking what they would like to teach our children and do teach them in too many instances.  In order to accomplish this, parental authority has had to be weakened.  Of course, the popular media has played a willing role in undermining the authority of Mom and Dad.<br /><br />There is so much more to his tour of the culture that I have to leave it for you to read.  What he does urge us to do is really common sense.  We have to take back the schools, we have to turn off TV programs (especially MTV and its ilk) that promote these inverted values, we need to write the FCC, our congressional representatives, and, in short, simply don't take it any more.  Frankly, it is going to take a cultural revulsion to turn things back, and it will happen one day.  Until then, we have to realize it is better to light a candle than merely curse the darkness.<br /><br />Good job, Ben!then, we have to realize it is better to light a candle than merely curse the darkness. <br /> <br />Good job, Ben!	2005-06-14

The author, Michael Smerconish, is a radio personality in Philadelphia.  He got on this issue when he was taking a flight with his family and his eight year old son was selected for \\"secondary screening\\".  Makes sense, right?  Many terrorist acts have been committed by eight year old boys.<br /><br />Then he heard John Lehman questioning Condoleezza Rice during the 9/11 hearings and was shocked to hear Secretary Lehman refer to a policy that airlines would be fined if they singled out more than two people of a given ethnic group, say Arabs, for screening.  He then did an on air interview with Lehman, then wrote a news article, then a TV show on this issue.  He also interviewed Herb Kelleher of Southwest Airlines who confirmed this PC policy about random screening.<br /><br />So, if you think our security is enhanced by pulling aside children, old women, or other members of groups never implicated in terrorism, then this book really is not for you.  However, if you would like to see how and why Norman Mineta insists on the present policy, you will find this book valuable.  It is a short book and reads quickly.  There is even a CD with portions of the author's radio show that are relevant to this book.<br /><br />I believe our present policies on screening are foolish and putting us at risk.  Smerconish is not advocating racial profiling, however, putting increased attention on those who are more likely to be terrorists simply makes sense.  Check your blood pressure before you read this book because when you see how out of it so many in our government are you might explode.	2005-06-14

While \\"The Intelligent Investor\\" exists in print in several editions, (4th rev edition 0060155477, 2003 rev edition w/ Jason Zweig 0060555661, and some audio book versions), this is a reprint of the original 1949 edition and has several virtues.<br /><br />It is the original statement of what has come to be called Value Investing.  This is a very philosophical book more than a book of techniques or methods of investing.  Mr. Graham writes firmly and clearly about where the Investor's interests really lie.  He is very hard on brokers, whose profession he considered more of a semi-profession because they have their own interests at heart more than those of their client.  He also makes a strong case of about the kinds of returns one can expect from the market versus a company one actively manages.  If investors of the 1990s had headed his views on management and their interests not being aligned with those of shareholders a lot less money would have been lost.<br /><br />In several places he states that shareholders need to act more like owners and should not simply submit to management or let them have free reign with the resources of the company.  He also advocated the importance of an independent board of directors rather than a board of management cronies.  He rejects the notion of simply selling shares if you don't like the way the company is being managed.  That is a dereliction of their duty as owners.<br /><br />There is also a discussion of a variety of approaches to investing and he contrasts defensive investing or investing using analysis versus speculating.  Like Buffett, Graham views investment as a buy and hold for the long term with active influence on the way the company is run.  In his view, frequent trading is the road to losses.  But at least you make capital gains possible for others.<br /><br />Obviously, much of the specific information about companies, stock performance, taxes, US Savings Bonds, and such have to be adjusted for.  We are more than fifty years later and much has changed.  However, the core philosophy of the book is solid, readable, and profound.<br /><br />The foreword provided in this reprint is by John C.

It is impossible to hear this title and actually understand what the author means.  You might think it has something to do with finance, or having your financial life on the bubble, or something else.  However, I doubt that the idea of managing your professional life - lives - as a portfolio of skills that you manage as a brand to keep yourself active and viable in the workforce ever came to your mind.<br /><br />That quibble aside, the book does have a lot to offer its audience of business professionals who very often face the need for reinvention after fifty years old.  It certainly isn't that these professionals have lost their skills or fire.  Some have, but more often it is more about musical chairs.  As you try to get promoted there are fewer chairs at each level and unless you get to be CEO, eventually the music stops and you won't have a chair.  So then what?  Some will have provided well for themselves and their family and will want to retire.  Others who have not been able to put enough aside will have to find a way to stay productive and earning well.  And some will have all they need to retire, but will want to keep working because that is what they like to do.<br /><br />The author uses his own experience in this situation when he was managing the Kiev office of a public relations firm.  He takes us through all he faced and then lets us know that he ended up buying the office rather than having his company shut the office down.  He ended up doing very well with the office and the guy who beat him out of the promotion ended up getting sacked.  So, at least the author's story ended up well.<br /><br />As the author takes us through a series of anecdotes and some stories to illustrate the principles he is discussing, he does make some very good points about viewing your career as a brand and how to manage it.  He makes a fabulous point of not trying to keep your career going after 50 with a resume.  They are useless for a couple of reasons.  If you have been too successful, the hiring boss won't want to compete with you and if you haven't been a star, why would they want you?  The author's approach is better.<br /><br />My favorite point is the author's declaration that retirement is really an invention of the twentieth century western culture.  Throughout history people either died young or worked until they became infirm and were cared for as wards of their children until they shortly died.  Sobering, but true.  Think about that as you think about retirement, working past \\"normal retirement\\" or see a busload of old folks heading towards a casino, of all things.<br /><br />I think this is a topic that needs serious discussion.  This book is a good starter, but I hope there is a more systematic book out there being written on this issue.  Mr. Willard comes across as part motivational speaker and part stern disciplinarian, but not so much the instructor that some might need to get their second or third reinvention together.They are useless for a couple of reasons.

Hugh Nibley was not only a brilliant man, a great scholar, and a dedicated teacher; he also had the gift of being able to cut past all the endless intellectual distractions to focus on what is important.  When I first read this book, frankly, I was blown away.  There was so much richness about the temple that I did not know.  However, more than all that are the essays and talks on what the implications of all this are for the way should live our life here with regard to what comes hereafter.<br /><br />A temple is the House of the Lord and God uses it to teach, enrich, and endow the lives of his children.  Brother Nibley is right that the temple is a scale model of the universe.  It shows not only our place and purpose, but sets us on the correct path through teaching, covenants, and ordinances.  Temples make eternity understandable and unite all ages of time in one eternal present with our Father.  In this book we not only see what was restored with the Church through revelation, the author also shows us echoes (not sources) of the true teachings in ancient and pagan temples and ceremonies.<br /><br />There are a wide range of essays on various aspects of the theme of the temple and the cosmos (the everything).  In one of them, Brother Nibley even talks about science fiction and the gospel!  It is full of interesting illustrations.<br /><br />Hugh Nibley enriched my own appreciation of the temple through the essays and talks collected in this wonderful book.  If you are interested in what he had to say on this important gospel topic, I recommend it to you.  The author makes so many great points of so many details that are easy to miss that you will never be able to look at the temple the same way again.  And opening your vision to seeing the world anew is what a great teacher does.	2005-06-11

The title might mislead those who do not know what the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS) is.  Rather, this book is a collection of twenty-four fine essays on various aspects of the temple.  It is particularly focused on the ancient world and how aspects of their temple worship resonate with what has been restored in our present-day worship in the House of the Lord.  There are eight parts with two to four essays in each.  They are:<br /><br />1) Reflections on the Modern Temple<br /><br />2) The Temple in the Hebrew Bible and the Ancient Near East<br /><br />3) Temple, Covenant, Law, and Kingship<br /><br />4) The Temple in the Book of Mormon and Ancient America<br /><br />5) The Temple according to Jadaism<br /><br />6) The Temple in the New Testament<br /><br />7) The Real and the Symbolic<br /><br />8) The Temple and Sacred Vestments<br /><br />According to the introduction, the majority of these essays are original to this volume and about half of them were given at a FARMS conference in 1993.  Not only are there three essays by Hugh Nibley, there are some ground breaking topics such as Donald Parry's notion of Sacred and Profane space that has been discussed more frequently in recent years.  All of the essays are solid and interesting.  There are also a number of insightful illustrations that amplify the points the text is trying to make.<br /><br />Yes, this is a big book.  However, you don't need to try and eat it all in one sitting.  Since it is a series of discrete essays, you can read them at your leisure and take your time thinking through what the author is saying.  I think you will come away with new insights and a deeper commitment to the work of the Lord in the temple.	2005-06-11

If we have had an opportunity to manage, we have seen employees who were a dream and others who were very challenging.  We might have even had to fire a few.  These kinds of direct experiences are much easier to handle than the kind of problems that arise within an organization because of its attitudes and policies towards its employees and management.<br /><br />This very useful book is based on years of research with millions of employees and analyzes what matters to people and what is destructive to organizational effectiveness.  This book examines a variety of approaches towards organizational culture and eventually advocates what it calls a partnership culture.  In short, the authors note that employees want a business relationship PLUS.  They also want trust, respect, some mutuality in the workplace and a sense of sharing in the improved financial state of the company.  In all my experience, money is important but seldom the primary issue for most workers.  By the time you are arguing about money, a lot of other things have broken down.  This book can help you think through how to avoid those awful workplace struggles.<br /><br />Some might say, well, we can't just give the employees everything.  Of course not.  The book is also full of helpful information on how to manage things in such a way that you allocate your compensation resources on things that actually matter to your employees rather than spending on things you guess they might want.<br /><br />This is a useful book.  Obviously, there are differences in every workplace and adaptations have to be made from these generalities.  However, employees are people and are not as fungible as some managers would like to believe.  By making a job or an employee simply an impersonal cog in some larger financial machine you actually end up costing yourself a lot.  Happy employees work harder, don't turn over as much, add creativity to the workplace, are attentive to quality and much more.<br /><br />Pretty good book.the workplace, are attentive to quality and much more. <br /> <br />Pretty good book.	2005-06-10

We call these specialized terms jargon, lingo, patois, idiom, argot, vernacular, or, boringly, its terminology.  If we are outsiders to that field we call it gibberish, slang, babble, blather, nonsense, or twaddle.  The point being that if you want to or have to function within a given field you have to find the meaning of these strange phrases and words.<br /><br />Business is a very rich field for harvesting new words and phrases.  It is such a large area of human activity that its practitioners and victims find especially apt ways of describing what it is that just happened to them.  Ron Sturgeon has provided us a handy and entertaining way to get clear definitions and examples of how this lingo is used by those already in the know.<br /><br />While you may know some or even many of the more than 1,200 terms included here, there are some very useful phrases you probably don't know.  One of my favorite terms that I had never heard of before I read this book is \\"Seagull Management\\".  Sturgeon credits this to Ken Blanchard and defines it as, \\"A style in which managers behave like seagulls: They swoop down, pick up a scrap of data, an error or something different, squawk loudly, crap all over the people in the vicinity and then fly off.\\"  Perfect!  You may even wonder what a \\"green weenie\\" is.  No, it isn't an enviro-nut.  It is something in a deal or a project that is unexpected, but found like a hot dog found in fridge that has been stored unplugged in a garage over the summer.  Nice visual, huh?<br /><br />Another treat offered are the drawings by the wonderful Gahan Wilson.  Yes, they have his humorously macabre style, but they also illustrate the definitions and add to your understanding of what they actually mean.  I have found his illustrations and drawings a treat since I first saw them back in 1973.<br /><br />Mr. Sturgeon has also provided a way for you to submit your own terms for future editions of this book.

212965:US	53052943	R31CVK0RX25XM3	039332639X	20116327	The Random Walk Guide To Investing	Books	5	54	56	N	N	A wonderful foundation  for building your financial future	It is sad to think about all the trees that have been felled to provide the paper to print so many thousands of useless books on investing.  Very few of them provide the investor with the truth about the market and what that implies for their financial future.  Those that push a system for beating the market or complicated strategies should be ignored.  Others who advocate the advantages of leverage rarely explain the true magnitude of the risk being taken on by the investor nor explain why these investments are almost never a good idea for a retirement account.<br /><br />This book is a delightful exception and I recommend it to everyone as a great first guide to getting yourself on a solid path to financial security and some truly golden years.  It is simple to read, contains just the bare minimum of financial terminology and therefore stays intelligible to the average person looking for the truth about their money.<br /><br />What I like about the approach taken in the ten rules put forward by Burton Malkiel is their universal applicability and the power it puts in the hands of each investor.  Of course, it also puts responsibility for his or her financial future in those hands as well.  The rules focus on starting to save early, saving in ways that keep your costs low, diversifying your savings so when one bad thing happens it only stings you instead of destroying your future.<br /><br />The author provides helpful guidelines for building a diversified portfolio to your personality profile and tolerance for risk.  I also liked his discussion of portfolio mix related to your age and where your financial interests should be in the various decades of your life.  He also suggests working a few extra years and why that could make a big difference.  He wants investors to pay themselves and to carefully use every tax advantage they are entitled to.  He also doesn't want you to spend money on tip sheets, investment guides, or an investment advisor.<br /><br />You probably know that the \\"random walk\\" portion of the title comes from Prof. Malkiel's wonderful book \\"A Random Walk Down Wall Street\\" in which he demonstrates that the market is usually extremely efficient and why even experts usually fail to provide even market returns (those pesky charges they make you pay them for providing a market return) and why index funds are the way to go for the average investor.<br /><br />The last chapter on stupid investor tricks is terrific.  This is a great first book for any investor.  Young people especially should start here and absorb its teachings into the marrow of their bones.  The author provides a wonderful quote by Woody Allen: \\"A stockbroker is someone who invests other people's money until it is all gone.\\"  And notes a story from the past when an investor was being wooed by an investment banking house who showed them all the trappings of their wealth and a tour of the bankers' yachts.  Their idea was to make him feel secure about placing his money with them.  However, he investor asked the salient question, \\"Where are the investors' yachts?\\"  There you have it.<br /><br />Strongly and emphatically recommended.ortion of the title comes from Prof. Malkiel's wonderful book \\"A Random Walk Down Wall Street\\" in which he demonstrates that the market is usually extremely efficient and why even experts usually fail to provide even market returns (those pesky charges they make you pay them for providing a market return) and why index funds are the way to go for the average investor.

I am certainly not the target audience for this book.  A few of my children would be among those for whom the book was written.  That being said, I was in my twenties once and have some idea of the decades that come afterward.<br /><br />The notion of the book is that a person has the whole world open to them in their twenties and need not - should not - simply rush into the mundane world of work and simply accept the easy and obvious job waiting for them when they get out of college.  When you are in your early twenties you have time to take risks and even start over.  The cubicle will always be there.  An opportunity to visit exotic locales or take an internship to explore a fascinating career will not.  Eventually, you have to get serious about life.  For most people marriage comes and then children and the ability to just take off and explore something simply for the experience becomes something in your past.<br /><br />This is NOT a book about slacking.  It is a book about releasing the energy of your youth and contains all kinds of helpful information that will help you explore your dreams.  I think it will even help people develop dreams.  Why not say, \\"why the heck not!\\" and go do something cool?<br /><br />I know from firsthand experience that simply living abroad for a couple of years is a terrific educational experience.  It broadens your view of the world and enables you to see your previous life as an outsider.  Most helpful in relating to others as you get older.<br /><br />All this encouraging support being said, I do have to add this bit of caution.  If you want to pursue an aggressive career to the \\"top\\", you have to remember that you are competing with everyone in your age cohort whether you know them or not.  The most talented are likely using these years to move forward with great focus and determination.  The competitive problem will only become apparent later when you have fallen out of serious competition.  While you were building a rich experience base, they were building a resume that can get attention.  So, while you dream and experience, try to use these experiences to move forward as well.<br /><br />Fun book.

Gordon Liddy is back in the limelight as one of those deeply involved in that break-in.  This book has an appendix that recounts the lawsuits Liddy has faced and used to promote his view of what the break-in was really about.  The traditional view is that it was the Nixon campaign's effort to spy on those running the Democrat campaign.  The Liddy / \\"Silent Coup\\" (a book promoting this view from 1991) view is that it was John Dean trying to protect his then girlfriend by trying to get information linking her to a call-girl ring the DNC used to entertain.<br /><br />There is interesting evidence presented in this appendix.  You will need to judge for yourself.  I did find it interesting that the bug recovered for the spying did not function and when made to function was on the wrong frequency.  It is also interesting that a key carried by one of the burglars (unknown to Liddy) fit the woman's desk who purportedly had the photos and information of the call-girl ring.<br /><br />However, this book is not principally about Watergate.  It is a series of seven essays that express Liddy's views on important aspects of how life in America has changed during his lifetime.  While he notes that the Civil War changed certain aspects of the various States to the Union, Liddy traces most the deleterious changes to rise of the Progressive movement during the time of Woodrow Wilson.<br /><br />The first essay recounts the loss of various freedoms that were still a part of our culture during his childhood.  The second chapter focuses on the importance of guns to our founding and our freedoms and argues forcefully against the reinterpretations of the second amendment.  He recounts how gun control has been used against the populations of various countries and how crime has risen in the UK since gun ownership was seriously curtailed there.<br /><br />The third essay on education is my favorite.  I agree with everything he says in this essay and commend it to everyone.  He notes correctly what education is, what is for, and why it is essential in retaining our freedoms.  The erosion of our educational system has been a key factor in the loss of our freedoms because the population is not correctly educated about what our freedoms are and why they are inalienable.<br /><br />In the fourth essay he takes apart the foolish and manipulative tenets of the current enviro crowd.  It is an enjoyable and sharp retort to what is uncritically peddled in our media.  The fifth essay is on the erosion for support of our military.  Liddy explains how we have weakened our military with notions of limited war and made ourselves more vulnerable.  The sixth essay is on the differences between men and women.<br /><br />The seventh essay asks if we as individuals and as a people will merely survive or prevail.  His notion of prevailing is actually quite inspiring.  Since even cheaters can \\"win\\" he focuses on prevailing - of being victorious with one's principles in tact.  It is a good essay.<br /><br />Liddy's writing style is efficient, crisp, clear, and passionate.  He doesn't pull punches (would you expect him to?) and is easy to read while being quite informative.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book very much.  If all you know about Liddy is some vague connection to Watergate, I think you will be pleasantly surprised by this book.  I also recommend his first book, \\"Will\\" that recounts his role in Watergate quite clearly./> <br />The third essay on education is my favorite.

Shareholders wanted to believe they could get 30% returns easily and forever and they hired management who would not only tell them they could deliver on that lie, they lied to deliver it.<br /><br />This book, however, is not my cup of chowder.  It is very soft, full of illustrative but unconvincing anecdotes, and provides nothing concrete.  There is encouragement and fuzzy notions about community and so forth.  But this isn't business.  It may be marketing, and positioning in the PC political world.  It may even represent the way some folks actually feel and behave, but there is nothing in this book you can use as a real tool or measurable yardstick.  Some folks will make claims about their own moral superiority, but it can't be demonstrated in any objective way.<br /><br />There are a few decent worksheets to help you think through your own moral compass, but I don't find them all that impressive.  One of the worst things in the book was the notion that all cultures and belief systems end up encouraging the same values and that demonstrates how people behave unless they are corrupted.  That is hogwash.  One reason honesty, fair dealing, integrity, responsibility, and fidelity are always emphasized is that we humans are quite willing to be dishonest, unfaithful, irresponsible, and so forth. We need to be reminded and taught the right ways to behave.  And we often need to have penalties imposed if we choose not to conform.<br /><br />This book may sell well.  Certainly, the notion of emotional intelligence appeals to some.  I have no idea why.  This book is similarly weak, in my view.  But if you like EQ and believe in it, then this will probably be a good book for you, as well.<br /><br />However, I think a simple notion of being honest, responsible, and faithful stewards is sufficient and that rewarding those who exhibit those behaviors and not working with those who do not is simpler and sufficient.ot working with those who do not is simpler and sufficient.	2005-06-03

If you can read this book as coaching from a most successful CEO of a huge corporation, you will be able to get a lot more out of it.  This is a practical book that is focused on real world activities rather than a book of theory or models to be debated in the world of business schools (although it would be a great read for any MBA).  One of the amazing qualities Welch possesses is an infectious enthusiasm for business.  When I heard him interviewed at the University of Michigan Business School for his last book and when I read his books, I get charged up to go out and do more.  To be able to get others passionate about their work is a real talent and very valuable for any leader.<br /><br />Keeping any organization vital, growing, and adapting to changes in the marketplace is a terrific achievement.  Accomplishing that with an organization with hundreds of thousands of employees that spans the globe and that works within many different legal and cultural environments is staggering.  If you don't believe it, I doubt if you have ever tried to run an organization of any size.  One of the things you will notice while reading this book is how hard Welch works at keeping things as simple as possible.<br /><br />At first, this might come across as simplistic rather than simple.  However, there is genius in the right kind of simplicity.  The right kind of clarity and openness can free up energy to act competitively, to innovate, and to strive for more learning and accomplishment.  Being simplistic offers only an irrelevant model that does not contribute to understanding or the right kinds of activities.  A simplistic model actually adds complexity to work because it encumbers people who are striving to implement the model while dealing with ever increasing complexities in their real world jobs that are unconnected to the model supposedly guiding their actions.<br /><br />I especially liked the way Welch talks about strategy and how his five questions get to the point.  Over and over again in this book, Welch stresses that these business processes should not take a lot of time to implement.  He focuses on days and weeks, at most a few months, rather than years to accomplish strategic decisions, implementing mergers, and other business activities.  How many of us have participated in painful and glacially slow change processes that never worked.  Doing it along the lines of what is discussed in this book would have been a lot less painful and likely more successful.<br /><br />Am I uneasy about anything discussed in the book?  Not much.  I do think that Welch comes across as somewhat callous and so focused on business activity that the truly human dimension might get lost.  However, I have never worked for him so I don't really know.  Unlike many, I think his doctrine of differentiation is a good thing.  If an organization does not continually revitalize itself it not only makes itself uncompetitive, it robs those who are successful from opportunities to advance.  As Welch describes the process of working with the bottom 10 percent and working with them to improve before letting them go, I think it is a good process.<br /><br />This book contains solid information that I will refer to many times.  I highly recommend it.  Just don't mistake its hard won simplicity for mindless superficiality.

The Internet has been a big provider of that information, and the author advocates building a trusting relationship with the customer and gain business and even higher profits because of being open, honest, and dependable.<br /><br />He admits that this is not for every business.  For example, commodities, products without differentiation, or where quality or quantity is beyond the control of the company, are all poor candidates for this strategy.  I think the author makes a telling comparison on page seventeen.  He says that employing Customer Advocacy is like shifting from subsonic to supersonic flight.  I would point out to the author that supersonic flight has been around for about fifty years and is only used in limited ways by the military.  Commercial supersonic flight has, so far, failed to be a viable alternative and may never be.  Is his theory really like supersonic flight and similarly unnecessary outside a few special kinds of commerce?<br /><br />The book's strongest points are its clear demonstration of the empowerment customers receive from all the ways they have information available to them.  They can drive down their costs, select better service offerings, and can more easily switch away from their traditional provider than ever before.  This does raise serious competitive issues for any company getting caught up in this crossfire.  Prof. Urban urges that you don't wait until you find yourself in trouble, but take positive action and reform your approach to the new marketplace to reap rewards before you find yourself playing catch-up because your competitors have lapped you.	2005-06-01

For me, it matters little what they did because they spent a portion of their life supporting the defense of our freedom.  Everyone in the military matters.<br /><br />Even so, those who have faced the rigor of combat have earned an even deeper gratitude.  What they face in battle changes their life forever.  It can never be the same.  An evidence of this is how difficult it is for combat veterans to describe their experience of the war to those of us who have never shared in that experience.  The closest most of us get is watching documentaries on The History Channel or reading serious books on the history of the various conflicts that have required so much of our soldiers.<br /><br />This is a wonderful and serious book.  Our country has awarded the Medal of Honor, our highest military award, to only about 3,400 recipients since the award was created.  Of that number, fewer than 140 are alive today.  This book provides portraits of those still living.  One page provides a current photograph of each man and another page briefly tells about what was done to merit the award.  Each story causes me to shake my head in disbelief.  These stories describe acts of selflessness, of duty, of courage that inspire a deep gratitude and admiration for these men and the thousands like them who have passed on.<br /><br />As I turned the pages of this book, I felt I was in a sacred place.  I looked at the picture of the young man who became a hero, read the words of his heroism, and then look in the face and eyes of the older man who has lived so long after those acts, and yet I suppose that day is ever with them.  I do not know, but from my own life I know that there are certain pivotal events that are never far from the surface.<br /><br />Millions of soldiers have faced combat and each has my gratitude.  In know that there are countless acts of service and heroism that are never recognized.  Those included in this book are only representative of the heroism so many have shown in combat.  To all of them, I say thank you.  To each of the men included in this book I also offer my deepest gratitude.  Your stories inspire us and provide examples of the highest qualities for future generations.<br /><br />We can all aspire to such selflessness, duty, and courage if and when we are called to face an extreme challenge.  It is good to document and remember these acts of heroism even if they are only representative of the truly large number heroes who have served our nation.  Those honored here are indeed special men with special stories.  As we hold these to our hearts with thanks we also need to think about the millions of stories we do not know and remember them as well.<br /><br />It was wonderful to read about the heroes from World War II and Korea that are still with us.  However, I was especially gratified to read about those whose heroic acts were given in Vietnam.  It is past time for us to take seriously our neglect of these veterans and realize all that was given in service on our behalf.  We owe then a debt and we need to pay it.  A first step is to get to know what was done for us and learn the truth instead of simplistic anti-war propaganda.<br /><br />You owe it to yourself to take a tour through this book and think about what these men, and so many like them, were asked to do and what they did to answer that call.only representative of the heroism so many have shown in combat.

If a successful organization decides to make serious changes, it needs to have great skill in assessing, managing, and measuring risk and its effects as those changes are planned and executed or they risk damaging or destroying their organization.  When an organization is in trouble, too often the reaction is to do something - anything - because the building is on fire.  So, they end up jumping from the fortieth floor onto the pavement of marketplace oblivion.<br /><br />\\"Failsafe Strategies\\" offers some very helpful methods of understanding how to view risk as an avenue to growth and success rather than an unknowable danger to avoid.  Prof. Chatterjee provides not only case studies, but also analysis of what the companies did well and what they did poorly in their attempts to take on strategic risk.<br /><br />He daringly takes on Enron at the end.  Popular notion has that company as a fraud from beginning to end.  In fact, the author states, it was very successful at trading natural gas, but its desire for growth led it into businesses it did not understand well and ended up using accounting fraud to mask its failures.<br /><br />As an entrepreneur, I live in a world of risks all the time.  This book provided me with a couple of insights and models I will use.  One of my problems with case study analyses, however, is that they are often simplistic in their statement of what caused what and what flowed from where.  For example, I found the assessment of why IBM failed with OS/2 and Microsoft won with Windows lacking because it did not fully explore the operating contracts that Microsoft forced on PC manufacturers that were later abandoned under pressure from the courts.<br /><br />There are also a few strange typos that should have been caught in editing.  On page 48 in a nice discussion on JetBlue, the text states that their CASM (cost per air service mile) is an industry low of $6.43.  Hmmmm, it really should have been $0.0643 or 6.43 cents per air service mile.  If it were dollars, they would have been out of business nearly immediately.  Also, the text praises JetBlue's new fleet and its effects on their costs, yet it ignores the reality of accounting effects that a new airline uses to their benefit, but how they come to bite them in a few years.  How is JetBlue going to manage that?<br /><br />Another typo was on page 59 in discussing the very real cost advantages of Sony Playstation using CDs instead of Nintendo's expensive cartridges.  The book states that the blank CDs were $5 - $10 each for blanks.  That is an impossibly high price for the cost of an individual blank CD unless they are somehow made to unique specifications (which would negate the reason for using them).  Probably the cost should have been $0.50 to $1.00 for blanks even in the early days of Playstation.<br /><br />Terrific subject and a pretty good book.  I think the author provides good observations and helpful analyses.  The book could have benefited from a bit of tightening of focus in the presentation of its points and certainly the typos should have been caught.  They undermine the confidence of the reader in the book.mile) is an industry low of $6.43.  Hmmmm, it really should have been $0.0643 or 6.43 cents per air service mile.

Certainly, those who served and fought have the reality of the experience to contend with.  However, any of us who were alive had to wrestle with our own reactions to the War, if we would serve if called, why we would or would not enlist, and many had to deal with the loss of a son, brother, or husband.<br /><br />This story begins in 1968 and spans roughly three decades.  A career military sergeant, Isaiah Ross, reluctantly becomes involved with the life of Billy Kern when he pulls his drunken and passed out body from a filthy puddle in Vietnam.  Patric Gallo, a military reporter, becomes involved when he covers a military trial on Billy Kern's fitness and Sgt Ross testifies that Kern is fit for duty.  I don't want to say too much about the story because unraveling what goes on is one of the payoffs of reading this emotionally involving tale.<br /><br />The author, Lawrence McAuliffe, served in Vietnam both as a soldier and later as a Catholic chaplain and was himself wounded in the war.  He involves us in these three very different lives and how each of them are forever linked to the conflict no matter how many decades pass and what they do with their lives.  Ross and Gallo try to call each other by their names, but to the very end easily revert to calling each other Sergeant and Lieutenant.<br /><br />Ross has a successful family and wants to leave Kern and the war in the past.  Gallo has a personality that fixates on things to the detriment of his personal relationships and his connection to the present and his own life.  Gallo is the one driving the return to Vietnam to search for the missing Kern whom Ross is sure is long dead one way or the other.  Yet, when they get back in country it is Ross who is more directly able to understand and cope with events and it is Gallo who would prefer to abandon his purpose and yet he cannot.<br /><br />The idea of recovering living MIAs is a dream of everyone even tangentially involved in the conflict whether they reject it as a real possibility or not.  McAuliffe makes good use of that dream and Buddhist sensibilities to show us that denial of events and our past never ends things, it only deadens us and postpones an inevitable reckoning.  He teaches us that it is only with facing the full facts of our life and dealing directly with what needs to be healed and how we can serve life by serving the living that we can find our way and reconcile the past.  It is the truth about the war as well as our own lives.  I enjoyed reading the story and thinking about what the author has told us.IAs is a dream of everyone even tangentially involved in the conflict whether they reject it as a real possibility or not.

Most of us read news stories or hear them on TV and radio that refer to this or that economic indicator.  The reporter says a few words about what that indicator behaving that way means, but we have no personal knowledge of what those measure mean, what was measured, or how professional investors actually use a given indicator (if at all).<br /><br />Bernard Baumohl has done every investor or interested generalist who cares to do serious homework on the economy a solid tutorial on what economic indicators are, a primer on the lingo, a huge chapter on the dozens of measures for the U.S. economy, a smaller chapter on the foreign economy, and a list of web resources you can use to look at the data for each of them.<br /><br />In chapter three each of the indicators is given its own profile.  The author provides a quick snapshot of how strongly the market responds to the indicator, what it is, where to find it on the internet (and whether it is free or for pay), release time, frequency, source of the indicator, and how often or how likely it is to be revised.  Then there is a brief essay on why the indicator is important and often shows and explains the data in the report.<br /><br />Not only is the information in this book valuable, it provides you with resources for as much research and work as you want to do in getting a handle on the economy so you can better understand its impact on your investments and economic future.<br /><br />Recommended.	2005-05-24

We sang about his body a moulderin' in the grave, but it was generally understood that he was some kind of crazy man who killed some people over slavery, had something to do with the Civil War, and we just shouldn't talk about it.  And I am from Michigan rather than the South so this avoidance wasn't based on region.<br /><br />In the sixties I was about as removed in time from the Civil War as today's young people are from the First World War.  That is, the people who were alive during the war were all but past and the children born to those who had lived through the war were now old.  Still, some of the received knowledge of the war came from tradition of those who had life experience rather than from books and scholarship.  However, with the Great War in our Grandparent's lives, the Second World War in our parent's lives and the echoes of Korea all around us and Vietnam getting under its bloody way, the Civil War just seemed too long ago to worry about in real life.<br /><br />I took extra time with this book because I wanted to wrestle with the idea of when a cause is important enough to justify personally initiated violence.  In our present state of affairs, it is hard to conceive a wrong so great that righting it would involve action outside the political and judicial processes.  At bottom, no matter how certain of the rightness and goodness of our cause, there is still some possibility that there is more to the issue than we understand and that those whom we would kill or murder might actually, in the cosmic view of things, not merit the death we would inflict on them.  We have doubts enough with the state rendering a judgment of death, how much more would we doubt the rightness of a private judgment that concluded in the death of a human being.<br /><br />The author, David Reynolds, does a solid job in telling the story of John Brown.  We see Brown as a human being within his time.  We see his faith in God, his Puritan sense of destiny, and his fury at the injustice of slavery.  As we follow him through his life we understand why he acted as he did and the enslavement and misery of four million souls makes his actions in Kansas and at Harpers Ferry make some sort of awful sense.  The last two chapters make clear that this author agrees with W.E.B. DuBois that \\"Brown was right\\".  Reynolds does take on the modern terrorism of the left and the right.  He takes on abortion, the environment, the Islamofacists, and more.  He argues that Brown was different and exceptional.  He notes the power Brown's words and how his cause was taken on by so many leading into, during, and after the Civil War.<br /><br />Yet, in my own mind, if I grant that Brown is an exception I have to ask what was he exceptional with?  And I note it was his eloquence in words.  I still cannot help but disqualify his violence as just.  His cause in freeing the slaves was certainly just, but if we allow his violence under what premise do we make that allowance?  Abortion has taken millions of lives, environmentalism claims they are saving the whole planet, animal rights claims they are sparing billions of animals, and on and on the fever goes until it reaches into insanity.  Whose conscience do we grant the privileged position of spilling everyone's blood?<br /><br />There is also a difference between the events in Kansas where the anti-slavery people were the victims of pro-slavery aggressors.  Many of these murders were committed by Missourians and other non-Kansans to impose their agenda of Salvery Everywhere.  While the Kansas events cannot be called self-defense per se, they were at least direct retaliation with self-preservation in mind.  Harpers Ferry was an aggressive act by Brown as a complete outsider with the view of starting a national slave rebellion.<br /><br />Brown had the passion, conscience, and eloquence that he could have used to make a powerful case against slavery as he did after his trial.  He would have had, I believe, an even greater impact against slavery with his preaching than with his sword.  Remember, every other country in the world abandoned slavery without the violence of our Civil War.  And even if we grant that the War freed the slaves in 1865 while a nonviolent approach would have taken decades longer, we also have to admit it was another century of work and too often bloodshed before the descendants of those slaves got close to the civil rights promised them.  And don't forget that the man who did the most to move society to accepting those rights was Martin Luther King, Jr. who preached nonviolence.  Thurgood Marshall won Brown v. Board of Education with his mind and a briefcase rather than a gun.<br /><br />Yes, there is more to do.  Certainly, there is cruelty and injustice almost more than we can bear in the world.  But bear it we must as we work towards a better world.  Our methods in that work do matter and we must not become deluded that our personal sense of righteousness actually grants us a special position from which we can deal injustice in the name of a higher cause.<br /><br />This is a thoughtful book and deserves to be read.

Even though Luther had already translated the Bible into German, the English priests and political authorities were dead set against the heresy that the scriptures should be a matter of private study.  They were certainly correct that such study would lead to a diversity of opinions.  However, one has to wonder of a uniformity born of ignorance isn't an awfully high price to pay.  Some would counter that the scriptures without a proper context do not lead to interpretation so much as a misunderstanding flowing from mistaken notions.<br /><br />In any case, this book is focused on providing the story of Tyndale's work and life to Latter-day Saints.  The author often compares the purpose and life of its subject with the life and work of Joseph Smith.  There are many parallels.  Both wanted to know God's will.  Both were deep students of scripture.  Tyndale translated the New Testament and the Pentateuch and a few other books of the Old Testament before he was strangled and then burned at the stake.  Joseph translated the Book of Mormon and the Pearl of Great Price (portions) by the gift and power of God, was given many of the revelations that are in the Doctrine and Covenants before he was assassinated by a mob in 1844.<br /><br />It is an interesting and instructive comparison.  The author also notes the importance of reformation as preparation for the restoration accomplished through Joseph Smith.  This is a good basic book to get a grounding in these topics.  However, there is a lot to be gained from further study.  The way Thomas More is treated in this book is rather simplistic; I guess the author needed a heavy.  And the resistance of the Catholic Church to private ownership of scripture is not given its due.  Of course, from the present day even the Catholic Church promotes individual scripture study.  It is important to note that the heresy and falling away from the orthodox teachings the priests feared did in fact come to pass.<br /><br />Latter-day Saints will be able to relate to Tyndale better because of the parallels to the life of Joseph Smith.  Others will be able to learn about Tyndale and his huge contributions to the English language and also about the contributions of Joseph Smith in the nineteenth Century and the scripture brought forth during his ministry.

The author of this delightful and informative book, Richard Chesnoff, has lived in and reported on France for decades.  He is quite aware of the charms of the country without being blind to its faults and perverseness.  This book provides us with explanations that help us understand why France is the way she is and how her relationship with the United States has had more vacillations than a drunk walking through the spinning barrels at Coney Island.<br /><br />Chesnoff shows us the current internal contradictions of French society.  They view themselves as the rightful dispensers of culture to the world while decrying the spread of our culture all the while eating at McDonalds, wearing Jeans, and watching our TV shows and movies.  They want to work less and are most concerned at their deteriorating social safety net and have the most uninformed notions about real life in America.  They imagine endless grinding poverty amidst the palaces of the rich.<br /><br />The author reminds us that France was an ardent supporter of the founding of Israel, but has slowly morphed into a staunch ally of the Arab nations.  The financial benefits, kickbacks, bribes, and corruption that France receives from nations such as Quadaffi's Libya and Saddam's Iraq go a decent way down the road in explaining their - nearly unilateral - opposition to the United States in extending the War on Terror to Iraq.<br /><br />Also, the Arab population within France is now around 10% and has a huge birth rate as opposed to the indigenous French population's negative growth rate.  Yet, the Arab faces are largely excluded from the media, and religious expression such as Muslim girls wearing the headscarves at school is banned.  Nonetheless, anti-Semitism against Jews is tacitly acceptable and all too prevalent.<br /><br />We are provided an explanation of the French educational system and how its emphasis on Descartes and individual work leads to some absurd expressions of national character.  There is a reason that deconstructionism experienced its florescence in France.<br /><br />The author also provides a chapter on why he continues to live in France, what he delights in even though he admits living in a medieval heap of stones that he has fixed up, much to the consternation of his neighbors who disapprove of anything that smacks of personal initiative.  Each chapter also begins with a delightful cartoon illustrating the point of the pages to follow.  One of the chapters also provides a list of French owned companies you can boycott if you wish.  However, once you read the list, you will realize that it is a tough thing to do.<br /><br />The appendix provides handy French phrases for dealing with snooty Frenchmen (or Frenchwomen) with a pronunciation guide and an English translation.  There is also a helpful index.<br /><br />This is a very fun and informative read.  The prose is a delight.  I cannot imagine why you would not want to spend a few hours enjoying its many pleasures.

Where he falls on your list is a private judgment, but most put him at or near the top.  It is true that there is a more vocal element of detractors nowadays, but those voices tend to also advocate versions of America that most of us would not recognize nor care to legitimate.  This volume begins with Lincoln as a young man of twenty-three beginning political career.<br /><br />The letters are quite interesting and cover a range of topics.  It is interesting to note his private correspondence on various topics such as the Mexican War and compare those notes to his public speeches.  While he is clearly a politician and aware of the need to garner votes, he uses his powerful intellect to find the line that will hold to his principles and still be convincing to the electorate.<br /><br />This volume culminates with the seven famed Lincoln - Douglas debates when those two candidates contended for a seat in the Senate representing Illinois.  Remember, this was before Senators were directly elected.  These were debates to win popular support, but also to show political viability so when the public selected the legislature, the legislature would choose the preferred candidate for the Senate.  These debates received national attention, which pleased both candidates.  The format was this: first speaker for one hour, response by the second speaker for an hour and a half, the first speaker responds for a half hour.  They alternated who spoke first with each debate.  They went after each other directly with challenges, personal attacks, interruptions, and appeals to the crowd.  Can you imagine any of our candidates even attempting such a risky format nowadays?<br /><br />As I read the debates, Douglas seems to be a panderer and clearly supporting slavery in a way that seems odd for someone seeking office in Illinois.  However, he was really positioning himself for the Presidency.  Stephen Douglas did become Senator while Lincoln did not.  However, two years later, Douglas did not get nominated as a candidate for President and Lincoln won the Presidency.<br /><br />This great volume has a chronology of Lincoln's life and notes on the texts and an index.ter, Douglas did not get nominated as a candidate for President and Lincoln won the Presidency.

Obviously, the more experience you have with the history of Europe the easier this book will read.  However, I did not find anything arcane or overly specialized.  And I found the emphasis on culture refreshing and particularly appropriate for the true influence Italy has had on our modern world.  This book will help you see how much the influence of Rome and later the Roman Church has had and continues to have on our culture.  The art and architectural achievements of Italian artists and those of other nations influenced by Italian aesthetics are still quite alive in our present world.<br /><br />There are a few dozen beautiful color plates and over a hundred black and white photographs and illustrations.  The maps are particularly interesting.  Watching the state grow from a bunch of Roman provinces to a unified Italy is quite interesting.  There is also a list of sources for further reading, a chronology of the centuries covered by this book as well as a list of sources for the illustrations included.  There is also a helpful index.	2005-05-11

This period is the year leading up to his election in 1860 through his assassination in 1865.  You will get to read amazing letters from the commander-in-chief trying to get his generals to fight and win the war, letters to all kinds of people covering topics public and personal, proclamations suspending habeas corpus and emancipation, his addresses to congress (our State-of-the Union Addresses used to be delivered by letter to Congress), and some of the greatest treasures in American history: the Gettysburg Address and Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address.  It is stunning that in all this writing, so much of it powerful and worthwhile, that these two brief speeches so obviously deserve to be engraved in stone for all ages to read and take into their souls.<br /><br />It is awfully moving to read the material related to the conduct of the Civil War.  He was very strong in his determination to destroy the Rebellion, yet he has very touching notes about his sick child and is very human in his communications with intimates.<br /><br />This volume also has a chronology of Lincoln's life and great notes on the texts.  Note particularly the Associated Press copy of the Gettysburg Address that was contemporary with its delivery.  The version most of us know is a finished copy prepared for publication.  The differences are subtle and not all that important, just interesting to note for style and rhetorical power.<br /><br />I strongly urge you to have these two volumes on your American History bookshelf.  Simply, they are important and you will learn a great deal reading through them.	2005-05-11

It is easy to do this since the name is pretty cool, and yet very few people know much about the true history of these peoples, and they have the wonderful aid for those who want to filch the name - the true owners of the name are all but extinct.  True, languages spoken in the Atlantic periphery derive from those peoples, but it is a tiny remnant of what was a vast and dominant culture.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book to become familiar with a fascinating and surprisingly extensive culture that dominated Europe before the Roman Empire conquered the whole of it.  Many submitted to Roman rule, many kept fleeing until there was no place left, and many more died.  In any case, it ceased to remain a living and independent culture although some traditions were adapted and transmogrified to exist acceptably in the Roman world.  Those that survived Rome were further changed or culturally extinguished by the rise of Christianity.<br /><br />The author does a great job in showing us how archaeologists and other specialists in ancient cultures are helping us understand the reality of the Celts and the richness of their culture.  More artifacts continue to be uncovered, the earthen mounds they built are being examined and yielding new information, and interest in them continues to increase.<br /><br />This book has a huge number of fascinating color plates, black and white photos, tremendously informative maps of various sorts, and great text.  Fascinating stuff.	2005-05-11

When the author describes certain events or issues in the world they just seem odd, but then I realize that I am seeing things as an American.  So, the book has real value in helping Westerners see what is getting attention in the Japanese business world.  Also, the English or the English translation used in the book is strange at times.<br /><br />The most serious problem I have in the book is that several times the author violates that old investment rule: take your money and run when you hear the words, \\"but this time it's completely different\\"!  Mr. Ohmae talks about the end of economics and urges agrarian economies to become high-tech communications economies.  Where have we heard that song before?<br /><br />However, the author is most interesting when he talks about solving certain problems in Japan.  For example, he mentions that Japanese rice farmers passionately resist importing rice.  Also, the government subsidizes the farmers extensively.  Adding to the problem is the growing population and the sky high price of land.  The author suggests that the government subsidize the farmers, but with the requirement that they buy land outside Japan where rice can be grown in huge quantities and quite inexpensively.  He notes that food security can be addressed by having these farms on multiple continents.  Of course, this is innovative thinking, but hardly new economics.<br /><br />The author does get a good view on the current changes in the world economy that flatten economic opportunity and make national borders functionally more like the borders between states in America.  However, I think his special pleading about economics and communications weakens his larger argument.  The book is best for those wanting to get of view of the current world through the eyes of Japan.	2005-05-11

Napolitano  sides with our founders and natural law and I think is he is correct, but it is tough sledding against the Positivists who have been running our law schools and sitting on our judicial benches for more than a century.<br /><br />Judge Napolitato has a fundamental problem with a government that can break its own laws with impunity while putting us in an inferior position of being held accountable to those laws.  He notes that this is the kind of tyranny that our founders through off when we broke with King George III and the British Empire.  When government can use its police powers indiscriminately, bribe witnesses, lie under oath, deprive citizens of property without compensation, and even attack them without consequence, there is more than a little wrong with our system of justice.<br /><br />We are taken through case after case of the government lying, entrapping, and even killing its citizens with little or no regard for the truth.  Napolitano argues that in many of these cases the government not only acted improperly, but that it had no just power to act in the first place.  After reading these horror stories it is easy to understand that the crisis here goes beyond the judicial problems that other books are highlighting.  This is a crisis of our entire system of justice and must be addressed.<br /><br />The author also takes on the War on Terror and especially the PATRIOT act.  Actually, this is the best exposition I have read of the problems with the act and what some of the abuses have been.  He also takes us to the prisoners being held as enemy combatants and makes a fairly strong case against the way we are treating them and holding them indefinitely.<br /><br />While I believe he points out real problems that we must address and I agree with him on the issue of natural law and inalienable rights, I do think the Judge strains a bit in the War on Terror.  I think he is right in the dangers inherent in giving up liberties for security; however, the terrorists we are after have no scruples about justice, rights, law, or innocent life.  As I understand it, the people held in Cuba could all have been summarily executed under existing conventions.  And more than a few who have been released have gone back to work on the other side in trying to kill us all.  It really does not bother me to fight a war at least as harshly as those who would deny the innocence of our citizens who are merely at work or at home and make them targets of their violence.<br /><br />And while Napolitano notes several times, correctly, that Congress has never suspended Habeas Corpus, he never does admit that Lincoln did so during the Civil War.  Yes, his doing that is still controversial and it certainly was not in the powers enumerated by the founders in our Constitution.  However, I will note that Congress has, over the centuries, shown an especial spinelessness that has led the other two branches to step in from time to time.<br /><br />My wish is that everyone would read this book and take it seriously.  Then get on your elected representatives to correct the abuses outlined in this book.  The most important thing we can do is to elect representatives who hold to the idea of the original intent of our founders in interpreting the Constitution and the notion of our rights being inherent and inalienable as sacred.<br /><br />Since Judge Napolitano takes after all sides in exposing these abuses, I can see why the book has not gotten the position in our national discourse that I think it deserves.  Making everyone uncomfortable may not win you friends, but in this case the author has done us a real service in demonstrating his points clearly and consistently.agree with him on the issue of natural law and inalienable rights, I do think the Judge strains a bit in the War on Terror.

What a difference of few decades make.  When I was a youngster the founders were all revered and taught in school.  Nowadays, they are almost ignored and condemned for not conforming to our modern view of morality.  Of course, the present view is both arrogant and ignorant because we assume that future generations will believe as we do and lacks the humility to realize that the human condition is fraught with weakness and sin as well as triumph and wisdom.<br /><br />Thomas Jefferson was one of the most remarkable men this country or any country has ever produced.  All you need do is sample these writings and you will begin to understand the powers of his mind, the charisma he manifested, the range of his interests, and the paradoxical foibles as well.  The writings included here are his autobiography, his Notes on Virginia, all kinds of essays, letters, speeches, and selected other papers.<br /><br />He writes of philosophy, English prosody, natural history, political observations, the history of the Founding, theological beliefs, and many other topics.  Both of his inaugural addresses are included as well has his notices to Congress (what we now call State of the Union Addresses used to be handled in a letter).  There are also letters to Indian tribes that are quite interesting.<br /><br />The idea that the Indian tribes would want to remain as they were seemed a mistaken to notion to Jefferson and his contemporaries.  They needed to understand that realities of their world had changed forever and they had great opportunities for improving their lives (as he saw it).  Their rejection of overtures to assimilate seemed evidence of an imprisoned mind rather than what we would call a \\"lifestyle choice\\".<br /><br />This is another of the great volumes from the Library of America.  It includes a chronology of Jefferson's life, great notes on the texts included, and an index.<br /><br />Something you really should have on your shelf of American History and our Founding.	2005-05-09

And yet, we see announced strategies fail time after time.  What breaks down?  What is the problem with a plan that looked so good on the white board?<br /><br />Prof. Lawrence Hrebiniak of the Wharton School makes a convincing case that it is in the execution of the strategic plan that things fall apart.  He takes us through the reasons why execution fails and they are many.  The plan doesn't fit the culture, poor internal communications (silos), lack of patience in building the ability to implement the strategy, a planning culture rather than an execution culture, incentives poorly aligned with the strategy, and so on.<br /><br />The author does spend a small portion of the book talking about what goes into a good strategic plan.  If you have ever read anything on corporate strategy, this summary will seem familiar.  However, the rest of the book is about what to consider about executing this great plan and all the things that you will likely face that will work against what it is you are trying to do.<br /><br />He has several helpful models that are simple and can help you make sense of what it is you are trying to do versus the resistance you are facing.  He has good advice on how to manage change.  I particularly like his discussion of embracing error versus avoiding it.  The denial of problems creates a kind of mental state that needs rigidity because any kind of movement will quickly expose all the errors the rigidity is trying to hide.<br /><br />This is a book about doing things rather than just thinking about neat ideas.  I like that approach a lot.  Obviously, the complexity of reality is far beyond the scope of this book, and you will likely only face a portion of what the book discusses in any given situation.  However, getting a feel for the broad spectrum of misery execution entails can be quite enlightening and brace you for facing down future futility.be quite enlightening and brace you for facing down future futility.	2005-05-08

He is truly one of the essential men who built our nation and deserves every praise we can heap on him.  When we see images of the founders, they are all shown as old men, not how old they were in 1776.  Franklin was really a generation older than most of the firebrands who led the Revolution.  He was seventy when he signed the Declaration of Independence (John Adams was 41, George Washington 44, and Thomas Jefferson 33 on July 4, 1776) and eighty-one when he signed our Constitution as a member of the delegation from Pennsylvania.  He was an amazing man.  He was a successful printer, inventor, philanthropist, revolutionary, diplomat, and all around student of the world.<br /><br />This fine volume from the wonderful Library of America is a collection of this great man's writings.  From early articles in his brother's newspaper, to the Preface and Maxims of the Poor Richard's Almanac, essays, speeches, letters, the FOUR parts of his autobiography, and much else.  You will read about his inventing the two-part spectacles and see his own diagram of his bi-focals, his views on slavery, why paper money was needed to help enliven commerce and the dangers of too much of it, his views on religion, his speech before the Constitutional Convention of the dangers of paying representatives at Congress, and so much more that is fundamental to our founding and all of it is amazingly interesting.<br /><br />This book is interesting to dip into and read just those portions that interest you, as well as reading its more than 1,500 pages front to back.  It has great notes on the text that provide contextual and translation help as well as sources, a most interesting chronology of Franklin's long and productive life, and an index.<br /><br />This certainly is a must have for your shelf on the history of America's Founding.	2005-05-07

His critics went into apoplectic fits when he won the Presidency, they sputtered in consternation during his two terms, and continue to rage against him even after his death.  Many books have been written about him and trees continue to be felled to publish new books about him.  Some of the books are good, but many present a false image of Reagan the man and the President.  The problem is that the rising generation has no direct memory of his time in office and is held captive by the information passed on to them in the various media.<br /><br />This beautiful and well done book should be provided to every young person so they can get a proper notion of what was so special about Reagan and what he accomplished.  Unfortunately, most of what they get in the popular media is the derision and contumely smeared on the name of Reagan.  Even some who claim to support the Reagan legacy are co-opting the glow of the name without being factual about what they are supporting.<br /><br />\\"Remembering Reagan\\" is full of great images that help us remember what a special time those two terms were.  The text is honest about what happened and all the issues that filled his eight years serving our country as Commander-in-Chief.  When you see the great pictures here you will wonder why the media relies on such weak pictures of Reagan.  Well, we know why, but their biased agenda becomes that much more obvious after looking through this volume.<br /><br />I would be happy to have my children learn about President Reagan from this book.  It may not be the only book you want them to read or read yourself, but I contend that you won't have a complete picture of this man until you also go through this fine book.  It is here you will get a sense of the energy, strength, presence, stature, dedication, quiet wisdom, and vast ability of one of our great Presidents.	2005-05-07

Everyone makes mistakes with their money.  We use it for foolish things, we spend too much, don't save enough, make dumb investments, and on and on it goes.  Most of the time we try not to think about our mistakes and if we don't learn our lessons we end up making the same kinds of mistakes many times.  So, sometimes it is good to get a reminder of all the kinds of mistakes we make and spend some time thinking about what we really should be doing to get our financial house in order.<br /><br />Ben Stein has written \\"How To Ruin Your Financial Life\\" in a gently humorous way that lets us see most clearly the foolishness of the decisions we excuse ourselves in making.  By writing the book as 55 financial principles you can follow to ensure complete and utter ruin, it is easier for us to recognize ourselves as having done far too many of these idiotic things.  I call them idiotic because you will find yourself saying, \\"What kind of idiot would do THAT!\\" and then you will remember that it was you (me).  So, the learning will begin and things will get better when you do the opposite of everything in the book.<br /><br />For those that don't get it, the Afterword sets out the fundamental principles in a positive way.<br /><br />One of the problems with reading little books is that you can dash through them quickly.  Don't!  Spend time thinking about each of these principles.  Better you should take one a day and really ponder it than try to swallow everything Mr. Stein is offering in one sitting.  Getting control of your money is too important to leave to happenstance.<br /><br />Thanks, Mr. Stein!	2005-05-06

If it is known, and the student's learning is measured by demonstrating mastery of the known, how much creativity is taking place?  It is a difficult and serious problem because a good education has to include methods for keeping pace with the constant flux of innovation that continually redefines the world we live in.<br /><br />\\"The Power of Impossible Thinking\\" by Jerry Wind and Colin Crook (and Robert Gunther), is a success in this difficult task because they don't try to provide a formula or recipe for successful innovation.  Instead, they focus on those aspects of the way our mind works and the mental habits we develop that end up trapping us and leading us into failure.  The basic idea of \\"Impossible Thinking\\" is that we need to free ourselves to seriously consider solutions that seem impossible.  When we examine them, we will often find that somewhere in that new and open field is a path to success we could not see from our previous vantage point.<br /><br />Now, if that were all they said it would not be much more than a repetition of the old saw to \\"think outside the box\\".  The heart of this book is a four step process to help us be systematic in a general sort of way to help us step into these new areas of thought and then be able to consider them in some rational way so we don't end up running off a cliff we didn't see behind the brush.  Those steps are:  1) Recognize the power and limits of mental models, 2) Test the relevance of your mental models against the changing environment, generate new models and develop and integrated portfolio of models, 3) Overcome inhibitors to change by reshaping infrastructure and the thinking of others, and 4) Transform your world by acting quickly upon the new models, continuously experimenting and applying a process for assessing and strengthening your models.  This last one should also include abandoning models as well.<br /><br />This book is not a panacea.  However, if it can help the reader to understand how limited a view of the world we all have and how that lack of seeing everything can limit us and blind us to new paths of success, it is worth its weight in gold.<br /><br />There is also an audio CD included that has a 20-minute summary of the book and then an interview with the authors discussing the ideas in this book.<br /><br />You will be better off having read this book.bandoning models as well.

He has personally read more widely and more deeply than some entire towns.  It is certainly not necessary to agree with him to benefit from his insights and analyses.  This book examines the notion that there was a body of writing that was central to Western Culture.  Each generation read these works and was taught about these works as an essential part of the transmission of that cultural to each rising generation to keep it alive.<br /><br />It not only enriched the lives of those so educated, it benefited the world because of the great values and life giving force of the rich ideas they contained.  He notes how this notion has not only been rejected by recent generations of academics, but is now almost unknown in the living generations of people who would constitute Western Culture if they knew what it actually was.<br /><br />He opens with an elegy to the Canon.  The book is worth reading just for this essay.  The next section examines authors of the Aristocratic Age.  All Bloom readers know he is a worshipper of Shakespeare (he calls himself a Bardolater).  He opens with an essay titled \\"Shakespeare: Center of the Canon\\".  This section also includes essays on Dante, Chaucer, Cervantes (another Bloom favorite), Montaigne & Moli&egrave;re, Milton, Samuel Johnson, and Goethe.  An impressive list, no?<br /><br />The next section is the Democratic Age and includes essay son Wordsworth & Jane Austen, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Dickens, George Eliot, Tolstoy, and Ibsen. The Chaotic age follows and includes Freud vis &agrave; vis Shakespeare, Proust, Joyce, Woolf, Kafka, Borges, and Beckett.<br /><br />Obviously, none of these sections is comprehensive.  These are only representative writers of the periods Bloom is discussing with us.  The final section is Cataloging the Canon and begins with an Elegiac Conclusion.  This essay urges that he is not offering us a lifetime reading plan.  Rather, he offers us a way to read.  He offers advice on how to immerse yourself in certain kinds of reading.  He urges us to seek better writing and to develop a taste that will lead us away that which is not worth reading because it takes you away from that which is.  He talks about how to develop the taste of a good Critic rather than spewing the politics of resentment or being numb to the great and good.<br /><br />Bloom then provides extensive lists of works from each of the three periods.  You may like to read some things on the list and not others.  As I said, agreeing with Bloom is really not the point.  It is being exposed to what is worthwhile in our cultural tradition and getting good grounding in why it is important that is critical.  Our emphasis on practical education and vocational training has left most of us with insufficient time in school to indulge our cultural education.  We have to do the work more or less on our own.

Every businessperson realizes that it is impossible to avoid mistakes in the conduct of what it is they do because reality is simply too complex and too undefined.  The issue is how we manage mistakes when they make their painful appearance.  This very interesting book focuses on how simple and almost incidental mistakes multiply into disasters that can wreck companies.  Robert Mittelstaedt provides something he calls M3 - Managing Multiple Mistakes.<br /><br />The author illustrates his points with well chosen war stories from the business front.  He focuses on being aware of the problems within the business culture and the way the processes are executed so that they cannot escape attention.  The disasters often occur when little mistakes are left unattended and unnoticed and cascade into something that swamps the business.  Theses small faults multiply in a way that is out of all proportion to their individual weight.<br /><br />The author makes 38 specific points in ten chapters.  He helps the reader understand the need to understand mistakes, how execution mistakes are made, how to use mistakes and successes as a catalyst for change, how to recognize a mistaken strategy, how cultural problems can lead to physical disasters, how \\"accidents\\" flow from culture, how mistakes can be used to help change organizational culture, how entire industries collapse, how small companies can kill themselves with mistakes, and how to use his M3 methodology within your corporate culture.<br /><br />This is a very well done and extremely valuable guide that deserves serious attention by every businessperson.  It is as simple as that.	2005-05-04

They bring several strong virtues to this task.  First, they not only reject investment fads, they believe in and focus on solid investment basics.  Second, they believe that you have the final responsibility for your money, so if an investment or financial program is too complicated for you to understand in every detail, they advise you to stay away from it.  Third, they understand and preach diversification.  Simply, diversification aids the investor by removing the risk associated with investing in just one firm or one market sector and therefore stabilizes earnings.<br /><br />The idea behind this book is quite good.  For the past two or three decades, all the talk around investing has been about growth stocks where you make your money by realizing capital gains.  Before the age of double dividend taxation, people invested for the income provided by dividends.  The present market for stocks is priced high in historical terms (see Stein and DeMuth's excellent \\"Yes, You Can Time the Market\\" to understand why this is true) and it is all too likely that a correction could provide losses instead of gains.  In this book, the authors provide an approach to investing that provides a return by gaining dividend income from stocks and interest income from bonds while avoiding the risk of capital losses as much as possible.<br /><br />Stein and DeMuth begin by talking about bonds.  They provide an excellent primer and then talk about the various types of bonds, their risks, and their returns.  Their discussion will help the reader understand that a higher return comes with increased risks.  In effect, the higher return is a compensation for taking on that higher risk.  The authors help the reader understand that there are some bonds whose increased risk is worth taking and many whose higher return is not sufficient compensation for someone counting on the income for their daily bread.<br /><br />The discussion then turns to developing a stock portfolio that is designed for income rather than capital gains.  This is an excellent and important discussion because it runs counter to most of the stock talk of the past generation.  Just as with bonds, they show the effects of various portfolio constructions.  They are very good on what matters to the income investor and what is dangerous to your financial health.  They have a short chapter on preferred stock that is interesting and gives adequate warning to stay away from complicated investments that you don't understand.<br /><br />The section on REITs is terrific and will help the average investor understand them.  They can be an excellent part of a portfolio and are an excellent way to participate in real estate without having to own and maintain your own properties.  Remember, in retirement you want to be enjoying yourself, not going through the hassle of being a real estate manager.<br /><br />They also talk about annuities in a sensible and helpful way.  Stein recounts how annuities helped his parents have a terrific retirement. The authors also balance that with cautions about the balance between fixed and variable annuities and offer solid advice about their complications.  They note that most of the people who sell annuities don't really understand what they are selling and to stay away from those you don't understand completely.<br /><br />The heart of the book is the section on how to combine all of these investments into a portfolio that balances your ability to take risk versus return.  They provide various example portfolios while always encouraging you to do your own research.  They want you to use the examples as models of what to do rather than as investment recommendations.<br /><br />Stein and DeMuth also provide a very good website that provides current information and links as well as errata for the book (you know the small typos that creep into any book).<br /><br />This is an excellent handbook for anyone who wants to take responsibility for his or her retirement and is serious about understanding what is involved.  There are too many sad stories of people who work their whole lives to save some cash and then have it evaporate in some inappropriate investment that promised them gold falling from the sky.  Stein and DeMuth have provided an excellent guide to understanding what is real and what is fluff.  You could not spend $23.95 better than to buy this book and then study it carefully.  If you do, you will be a much better investor and steward of your financial future.e responsibility for his or her retirement and is serious about understanding what is involved.

The authors admit that the book does not have a central theme, but like a freak show it wanders from a curiosity to something amazing to the unexpected.  The difference here is that it is a display of freaky things revealed by economic analysis.  The word economics gets used so carelessly that it is not well understood by most people.  Possibly the only word more loosely defined is the list of people calling themselves economists.  Since it is not a defined profession, almost anyone can call himself (or herself) an economist, and too many do.<br /><br />By any measure, Steven Levitt, is an economist.  He has the academic credentials, academic publications, and actually teaches economics at the prestigious University of Chicago.  His co-author, Stephen Dubner, is a journalist from New York who presumably helped smooth Levitt's ideas and observations into generalist reader prose.  This is a book that is fairly easy to read even for someone with the barest exposure to economics.  For the purposes of this book, economics is how people make choices in their behavior in the face of incentives and disincentives of various sorts.<br /><br />Levitt makes a big deal out of his not being an econometrician (an economist who expresses his ideas in higher mathematics rather than words and whose research can tend to be studying mathematical behavior rather than flesh and blood human beings).  The old econometrician joke goes like this.  There were three econometricians out deer hunting and they see a big buck.  The first aims and fires, but his shot is five yards left of the deer.  The second shoots, but his shot if five yards right of the deer.  The third starts walking towards the deer and his companions ask him why he was not shooting at the deer.  He replied, that on average they were dead center, so they must have killed the deer.  You get the idea.<br /><br />This book shows us the author's views on why drug dealers live with their mothers despite the popular notion that they make a lot of money, why a swimming pool is much more dangerous than a gun, how Roe v. Wade may have impacted the crime rate favorably and is still an inefficient tradeoff in fighting crime, how teachers and sumo wrestlers cheat in response to incentives and how to catch them (very interesting, actually), how and why we know there were never 3,000,000 homeless as Mitch Snyder claimed, and how much do parents really matter (by far the least convincing part of the book).<br /><br />While this is an entertaining read, and I hope it will spark some young people (and not so young adults) to want to study and read more about economics, I took a full star off because the book too often denigrates mathematical analysis as boring and as if it were unnecessary.  Levitt makes a point that he is an economist, but is not all that good at math.  Well, since his papers and this book make constant reference to regression (a statistical method), which is a form of applied math, either he or his co-authors had to know something about mathematics and statistics.  More than that, his argument with anecdote and sharp observation, while entertaining, is not in itself conclusive.  Proof usually is only granted when all debate is overwhelmed by hard mathematical evidence and analysis.  Without the math, the author is simply arguing from authority. That is, I am a big deal authority with a bunch of awards so listen to what I am saying because I know more than you.  Well, that may cut it in the popular press, but it is not science and, in a way, undermines the purpose of a book like this.  The book provides you ways of challenging the kind of authority the author is using to assert his observations.<br /><br />That caveat aside, this is an entertaining read that can open up some new ways of thinking about everyday events and provide some techniques to enable the reader to go a bit deeper when faced with news stories proclaiming one absurd thing or another.<br /><br />Recommended!ended!	2005-05-02

Ari Fleischer did a great job during very difficult times.  He was there in the 2000 campaign and recount, when the new Bush administration took office, during the intense national sorrow and anger surrounding 9/11, the launch of the War on Terror in Afghanistan, and its continuance in Iraq.  No wonder he felt burned out and wanted to leave before the 2004 campaign began in earnest.  After all, he had a new wife and they wanted to begin a family.  I think he did a great job and made a good choice to leave when he did.<br /><br />What is particularly interesting about this book is that the events it describes are still fresh in our memory.  Nearly all of us experience these events through the media of television, newspapers, weekly magazines, opinion journals, and so on.  Here, Mr. Fleischer provides his perspective on these events from the inside versus how the media reported the events.  The contrast is illuminating.  He does debunk some of the popular myths about these events and makes clear what was really said by President Bush and the administration.  He is also very clear that the Administration's certainty over the Weapons of Mass Destruction was held by everyone around the world, but was wrong.<br /><br />He also has several amusing anecdotes about interactions with this or that reporter over various events.  Sometimes he gets off the witty line and other times he is the butt of the joke.  He was serious about doing his job well, but under such serious circumstances humor was required to keep things approximately sane.<br /><br />While some who hate the Bush administration have taken after this book, largely without reading it, I can tell you that I have read it.  This book is written engagingly and provides a fresh perspective on recent events that are now becoming a part of history.  It is important to get a deeper understanding of our time than the varying and often contradictory news reports.  Historians, especially those covering politics and media, will consult various sources for these events to write their books, and I am sure one of them will be \\"Taking Heat\\" by Ari Fleischer.<br /><br />Good job.t events that are now becoming a part of history.

Sure, he is challenging and, sure, he would like things to be a lot different than they are today.  However, by taking us far away from today we can get some perspective on what it is we are really doing versus what we think we are doing.  This book is a series of short chapters and thought experiments on what we could do to radically shrink our government and actually free ourselves to live our lives the way we think best.<br /><br />The book is in three sections.  In the first he lays out the framework of what limited government would actually mean.  Nearly everyone comfortable with our large and centralized bureaucracy will be in danger of getting the bends from reading this.  However, I urge you to press on and read the second section on \\"How Would It Work?\\".  Here are the thought experiments that will show you how to eliminate so much waste and freedom reducing regulation from our lives.  The last section has the title \\"Is It Possible?\\".<br /><br />In this last section Murray notes that Americans do not want to give up all government, but that if we wanted to truly be free, we could achieve it and not abandon ourselves to a Hobbesian nightmare of solitary, nasty, brutish, and short lives.  Is he persuasive?  I like Murray and would like to move in his direction more than in the direction we continue to drift today.  We are abandoning ourselves to a nanny state that cannot deliver on her promises.  We then try to solve the failures we see by redoubling our reliance and dependency on the very institutions that are failing us.  We seem to be possessed of the delusion that those who work in government are imbued with special powers, judgment, and moral sensibilities above our own.  In writing it this plainly, its absurdity is manifest.  However, we fear to give up our childish security blanket so we can get more comfort from pretending.<br /><br />However, you will have to decide for yourself and reading this book, even if you reject it after thinking about it, will do you a great service.  Just be sure to actually work out Murray's ideas in your own mind rather than a simple emotional rejection.ou will have to decide for yourself and reading this book, even if you reject it after thinking about it, will do you a great service.

It is full of documents that are contemporary with key events of the Revolution from various points of view.  They are from diaries, newspapers, letters, speeches, key official documents, excerpts from books, and so on.<br /><br />Of course, part of the problem of reading contemporary documents is that the non-specialist will need some helps to put them in context, understand who wrote them, who the key participants are, and so on.  The editor has provided a very fine chronology of the War, Biographical Notes, Notes on the Texts, Explanatory Notes, an index, and a surprisingly helpful table of contents.<br /><br />The documents are presented chronologically with the dates along the top of the page.  You can read it front to back or jump into it here or there.  While this volume will enrich your understanding of and appreciation for our Founding, it will also provide a jumping off point for further study.  Since these are all source documents that historians use in their writings, having read them will allow you to read secondary writings on our founding with more authority and their biases and any agenda they have will stand out more clearly as your read their work.<br /><br />A must have for your American History shelf.	2005-04-26

Because Thomas Sowell simply does not pussyfoot around these subjects, some have criticized this book for being too harsh and too one sided.  On the contrary, it is simply open and honest about its thesis.  It is less harsh and more serious than anything you would read by say, Maureen Dowd, Paul Krugman, or Frank Rich.<br /><br />The fundamental thesis of the book is that there is a self-anointed group of people who individually and collectively feel the need and the right to decide social policy for others.  Too often, these policies result in harm to those designated for this help and despite all evidence, those providing these policies feel gratified that they have done so much good and wish they could only do more if not for the ignorance and resistance of those who would like to choose for themselves how to live.<br /><br />I think this is a powerful and richly rewarding book.  However, those who would most benefit from the wisdom in this book will likely not read it and if they read it they would likely be resistant the self-revelation they could gain.<br /><br />Thomas Sowell is a wonderful thinker and writer and I commend everything he ever wrote to you.  It isn't that he is right about everything.  It is that he understands what he thinks and expresses it in such a way that you can actually wrestle with his thoughts and come to your own considered judgments.  In that way you will be more richly rewarded than if you simply accept or reject Sowell's ideas on face value.	2005-04-26

He is full of New York bombast and is willing to go beyond the bounds of ordinary discourse to express his anger and passion for his ideas.  Sure, some of it is radio theater and hyperbole for the entertainment of his listeners, but so what?  It is a successful commercial show on 400 stations with millions of listeners who come from all political stripes rather than a subsidized show listened to by almost no one.<br /><br />Why so many are focused on the fact that Savage is a stage name is beyond me.  That is true of so many people in show business that I wonder how it could be an issue.<br /><br />Reading this book is somewhat quieter than listening to his show, but it reads much as Savage sounds on the radio.  He even has some key words italicized and spelled stylistically to evoke his vocal style.  Savage's critics love to go after his rhetorical excesses (and there are plenty of them) in order to avoid the substance of the point he is making.  While the author doesn't need any defense from me, I will summarize the key point from each of his seven chapters.  I will not offer my own opinions of his points.<br /><br />The first chapter makes the point that we are seriously at war with people who want us dead.  He argues that we won World War II with total war and by summarily killing the Nazi insurgents.  Savage fears that our present method of limited warfare has not done well for us in the past and in the face of such a determined foe with such a long view of history, that it will end up costing us more than if we decided to just fight the war in earnest now.<br /><br />In the second chapter, he takes on the political correctness that is very conflicted around Islam and the Islamofacists or Islamicists (pick your favorite term).  He notes that Islam is getting protected in public schools in ways that Christianity and Judaism are not, including set aside prayer rooms (see also Paul Sperry's \\"Infiltration\\" on Amazon).  Savage provides a tour of these inconsistencies between the message that Islam is a religion of Peace and how it actually treats women and minorities in countries where it is dominant and the way it exists and the problems that exists within countries where it is a minority.<br /><br />Chapter 3 points out the serious problem that the uncontrolled invasion of illegal immigrants from Mexico is devastating the economies of the border states and costing the rest of us some serious cash as well.  Over 8,000 cross the border illegally every day.  That we send catch 55,000 and send them back doesn't mean much.  Savage points out the technology we use to monitor traffic and catch violators to assess fines could also be used to monitor our borders.  What we lack is the will to secure the borders.<br /><br />In Chapter 4 Savage goes after the inversion of values by those who have been entrusted with power in our system.  The author is no globalist or free trade advocate.  In fact, he reads more like a mercantilist-nationalist.  He goes after Bush for leading us to ever greater trade deficits (now, including agricultural products) and outsourcing industries.  He notes how the huge settlements gotten by trial lawyers really end up making us all poorer and none the safer by raising costs and driving businesses to close or leave.  He calls the villains of this chapter the Briefcase Mafia.<br /><br />The next chapter, 5, exposes the way the press and electronic media suppress truths about those whom they prefer.  Few outlets in the United States reported the truth about the monstrous behavior of Arafat nor did they demonstrate clearly the contradiction between what he said in English for US consumption and what he said in Arabic that directly contradicted and refuted what he had said in English.  Savage goes through several others such as the recent movie on Kinsey and the Clinton Library dedication love fest.<br /><br />In chapter 6, Savage takes on the ACLU and presents his case that the ACLU has nothing to do with promoting a Constitution based protection of rights but everything to do with promoting a social agenda that is not supported by the majority of Americans.  He also discusses how they package their agenda in a way that hides what they are really after, but couches the terminology in focus grouped tested language that helps them poll and market their agenda in a package that is deceptive.<br /><br />The last chapter contrasts the differences in \\"red\\" and \\"blue\\" state values.  The term is really worn out because many people who hold opposite values do live in each \\"color\\".  However, in the past election the amendments against gay marriage were passed.  Every one of them passed with large to huge margins.<br /><br />Each of the chapters has a \\"Savage Solution\\" that, I think, are really there to be provocative and to shock people into an agitated state so they can actually address these issues.  For example, he calls for an \\"oil for illegals\\" program where Mexico has to supply us with a free barrel of oil for each illegal within our borders to help defray our costs of supporting their citizens.  He also calls for the ACLU to be charged under the RICO statutes.  You might like these ideas, you might find them outrageous, but you won't likely just turn the page and sigh.<br /><br />I don't agree with all of Mr. Savage's views, nor do I disagree with all of them.  What upsets me is the vitriol that tries to silence him because of his style of delivery rather than his views.  None of the views that I have listed here are really out of bounds for political discourse.<br /><br />Read the book and decide for yourselves.n the ACLU and presents his case that the ACLU has nothing to do with promoting a Constitution based protection of rights but everything to do with promoting a social agenda that is not supported by the majority of Americans.

I could pick out some faces, dots, and a vast array of images I could not make anything of.  This book takes us on the long trail of decipherment that began centuries ago, but the breakthrough came in 1952 in the Soviet Union.  The thirty year old Yuri Knorosov took up the research because it was a safe topic in the USSR and the story of what he accomplished is stunning.<br /><br />This fascinating book begins with the story of how ancient scripts have been decoded throughout history.  Cuneiform, Egyptian Hieroglyphs, and even Chinese and Japanese have all presented challenges that have been solved.  Several scripts remain unreadable.  Michael D. Coe shows us how the early discoverers of the Maya worked on trying to read the characters they saw on the monuments and buildings the dug out the jungles of Central America.  Their guesses and surmises about the writing actually held up decipherment because the fundamentally misunderstood how the script worked.<br /><br />The author also shows us how to read the writing.  It is a fascinating process.  Of course, what we read is still Mayan, but he provides translations for us.  It is also interesting to note how the same character varies in appearance in different places and at different times.  After a bit of practice, you can pick up the knack of seeing the similarities and recognizing what you are seeing.<br /><br />There are many helpful photos, drawings, and tables as well as an index.<br /><br />Simply cool.	2005-04-22

If you already have first hand experience of that painful excitement, this book is still useful to help you think through why you are where you are and what you got right and what you got wrong.<br /><br />This is not a how-to book on starting a company.  Its purpose is to help the entrepreneur think clearly about identifying and positioning a business opportunity in a way to give it the best chance for success.  Too often, a person falls in love with an idea for a product or service and plunges ahead without proper preparatory analysis and finds out that it was not a product or service the world needed only after their life savings are gone.<br /><br />Dr. Shane provides ten rules to help the reader develop a solid business concept.  While thinking through these topics will not guarantee success, they will improve the odds of doing well with a good idea or identifying a bad idea before money and effort sent into a shredder.  These rules are:<br /><br />1) Select the right industry<br />2) Identify valuable opportunities<br />3) Manage technological transitions<br />4) Identify and satisfy real market needs<br />5) Understand customer adoption<br />6) Exploit established company weaknesses<br />7) Manage intellectual property<br />8) Create barriers to imitation<br />9) Choose the right organizational form<br />10) Manage risk and uncertainty<br /><br />Each of these ideas is developed in a dedicated chapter and the chapters have a standard and helpful organization.  The rule is developed in the main text with examples and explanation.  There are shaded boxes labeled \\"Don't Do It!\\" and have a couple of succinct points of what not to do when formulating your business idea.  These are very helpful because they are common traps that often ensnare people thinking about a start-up.  At the end of the chapter is another box of \\"Questions to Ask Yourself\\".  I think it is essential to think through an answer for each and every one of them.  Challenge yourself.  The more work you put in at this stage the easier the implementation of the idea will go.  Each chapter then has a summary to hit the main points one more time in short form.<br /><br />If the reader loses focus on what this book is about it is easy to focus on the aspects of building a business this book doesn't address.  But it never intended to address anything other than identifying and formulating a good business opportunity.  The authors also refer to good opportunities as technology businesses.  While this is mildly distracting, they are not referring to computer businesses.  They are talking about businesses that use the latest science, processes, and, yes, computers, to deliver new products and services.<br /><br />I think this is an exceptionally useful book for anyone even thinking about thinking of starting up a business.  The questions and thinking that this book leads you through is critical and will help you avoid many painful errors.<br /><br />This book also comes with a CD that contains an audio summary of the book that is quite helpful to listen to in your car.

It is a document of the Quiche Maya who lived (and still live) in a portion of what is present day Guatemala.<br /><br />The \\"Popol Vuh\\" tells the essential myth of the ball game and the hero twins.  Its story is far too involved and strange to try and explain it in this review.  The story explains things about the Sun, Moon, and Venus in their play across the heavens.  It prepares the living for what awaits them in Xibalba (the awful place below the earth).  And there is constant gratitude for the knowledge of the creation of men from maize and the light of understanding this book brings them.  The various sacred places of mountains, caves, and of ritual sacrifice are all here and powerfully expressed.<br /><br />Dennis Tedlock translated the text into clear and very readable English.  However, that is not sufficient for the uninitiated to understand.  So, Tedlock provides us with an introductory essay to help us understand the context of these stories.  At the back he also provides notes on the text arranged by page number, a glossary of terms (which we desperately need to read the book), a wonderful bibliography for further reading, and an index.<br /><br />Now, a couple of things to keep in mind when you read this book (and you should).  This text has one written source, and it is written in the Mayan language with a Western alphabet.  Also, this copy is post Conquest so there is no real way to know how the story was changed or influenced by the Christian stories that were also (forcibly) taught to the Maya, if at all.  If you end up believing that this story is an intact retelling of the true Myth without Christian influences, there are some pretty strange and wonderful parallels.  If you are uncomfortable with some of the parallels, then you will want to explain them away by claiming corruption by the Christian conquerors.  Take your pick.  No one really knows.<br /><br />Terrific edition of an important text that you can really enjoy reading and adding to your understanding of the world and the total range of the human experience.ving that this story is an intact retelling of the true Myth without Christian influences, there are some pretty strange and wonderful parallels.

He is very clear that he is no different and no better than thousands, maybe millions, of other young men who gave so much to us in their military service.  He points out that the same sacrifice is going on today and that we have an obligation to not only honor with our voices, but to reach out and support the soldiers who were wounded, and the families of soldiers who have been killed and maimed in service to our nation.<br /><br />Before the war he was a fine example of a mid-western son of Kansas.  He had athletic ability, intellectual talent if a bit unfocused, and the dream of becoming a doctor.  When the War came, he answered the call along with hundreds of others from the University of Kansas, thousands from his region, and millions of his generation.  Bob Dole took on the challenge of Officer Candidate School and even some intense college study.<br /><br />He was sent to Italy in the waning days of World War II and was sent to the front to take the place of some other lieutenant who had fallen.  The first forty pages of the book describe the intensity of the battle in which Senator Dole would fall.  It is a very well written account.  Like the rest of the book, it is very open, frank, unsentimental, but very human and full of real but understated emotion rather than seeking pathos.<br /><br />One of the things that makes the story of his struggles towards a more normal life so compelling is that the public Bob Dole has done all he could to not exploit this story.  He has always worked hard to minimize the effects his wounds would have in his public life and in meeting people.  Knowing now how damaged even his left hand is, I almost feel badly for shaking his hand when he was running for President.  He has tremendous drive and is willing to pay a very high price to serve.  Sure, he has done well personally, but it is the result of great tenacity and an inner strength that simply will not back down in the face of tremendous obstacles.<br /><br />Like everyone else, I knew his right arm and hand were shattered in a war experience.  I did not realize how extensive the damage really was, and is.  Nor did I know how painful and difficult the recovery was, or his struggles with multiple infections that nearly killed him.  His years of therapy just to approach walking normally again after being quite a competitive runner make a great example to anyone thinking of quitting in the face of any adversity.<br /><br />And, as I said before, the best part of him sharing all this with us, is in fact its inspiring nature rather than calling on our sympathy or pity.  He lifts us and asks us not to look at him, but the millions of others who need our help and support.  He particularly wants us to remember and help the wounded of the present conflict and shares a dedicatory story of one of those fallen heroes.  Unlike those who seek glory for the actions in war, when Bob Dole was told he was a hero he replied, \\"The heroes are still over there.\\"  Do you need to know more about this man's character?<br /><br />This is a great read and a noble story.  Please read it.not back down in the face of tremendous obstacles.    Like everyone else, I knew his right arm and hand were shattered in a war experience.

The authors are quite frank about the vague nature of some of the components of the equations they develop because you have to make some assumptions about the future.  I really like their statement that it is better to be vaguely right than precisely wrong.  Upon close examination that statement actually sounds better than it really is, but it gets the point across.<br /><br />The basic idea is that your customers represent a series of cash flows.  Using the tools provided in this book you can make reasonable assumptions and make an estimate of their value to your firm.  This can help company executives make better decisions about marketing spends, acquisitions, and in targeting customer segments.  It can help investors and analysts double check company predictions and market valuations.<br /><br />Since we have been through a period of corrupted financial reports by too many companies, it is great to have another tool to check the value of a corporation, no matter how rough.  In fact, the measure is so easy to run, it would be great to make a range of assumptions to create a bounded \\"realities check\\" in order to see what would need to occur for a given investment or management scenario to be a good decision or realistic outcome.<br /><br />The one tiny area where I think the authors head off into the world of making the whole world a nail for their new hammer is their idea of a CMO, a Chief Marketing Officer.  There are too many Chief whatevers in companies nowadays.  I think the reality is that if this turns out to be a useful and predictive tool that executives would be foolish to not use it.  The role of marketing within a corporate structure has more to do with the role of marketing in the nature of the product.  For example, Proctor & Gamble is a marketing firm and has to emphasize it much more than a captive auto supplier.  It is not something that can be uniformly prescribed.<br /><br />Far from being an abstract exercise in quantification, this is a lively and concise book with many case studies to illustrate the authors' points.  Just beware that every new idea cannot really be proven with past data because of the danger of fitting the data to the needs of the tool.  You will have to work with these ideas and see how they work in your organization.  My guess is that these ideas will yield good results if used well.<br /><br />Good business book.captive auto supplier.  It is not something that can be uniformly prescribed.

Brian Anderson begins with the cancellation of the CBS made for TV movie, \\"The Reagans\\" after Drudge leaked aspects of the script and Fox on TV and conservative talk radio alerted those who still revere The Great Communicator.  The popular outrage would never have occurred before the alternative voice to the \\"mainstream\\" or \\"elite\\" or \\"old\\" media developed.<br /><br />The eight chapters of this book take us on a tour of the way conservative ideas have affected traditional media, found their voice in new media, and been transformed and fragmented by their being transplanted in new environments.  The title of the book is itself a transmogrification of the term South Park Republicans.  A chapter in this book is titled South Park Anti-Liberals and that, I think, probably catches the real substance of the idea.  The spread of conservative ideas has moved the debate more towards the center simply because there is more right of center mass to tip the scales a bit back towards even.<br /><br />After 9/11 a number of formerly left folks have moved right on defense without feeling the need to adopt the conservative social agenda in any way.  The author takes us on a tour of the smorgasbord that is the whole of \\"conservative\\" argument nowadays.  Anderson takes us into the blogosphere, the publishing industry with many new conservative imprints (among which Regnery is a huge force in conservative thought), and onto the campus.  Some of the talk is familiar to those of us that have been conservative for decades, but much of it seems half-thought out and somewhat self-contradictory.  However, I think this still represents an advance.  One cannot expect that a system of thought will advance completely intact.<br /><br />I remember going to buy a copy of National Review at Borders in the late 1970s and being ridiculed at the checkout stand.  Now we can enjoy NRO as well as the print version of the classic conservative magazine.  Even so, there are so many other voices to read and enjoy that debate conservative ideas and reform and reformulate them because of the other ideas the authors associate them with.  What the end of it will be we cannot predict with confidence.<br /><br />Anderson has a central chapter on the Comedy Central show \\"South Park\\".  He shows its humor and demonstrates its power in ridiculing standard liberal thought.  He admits they also take on conservative cant and is incredibly vulgar.  In fact, the show is so vulgar that I have not been able to watch it in anything more than fragments.  I am not a prude, but I don't need to be hit over the head with so much crudity.  However, I will admit, the show can be incredibly witty and funny at times.  I also admit that the show is not aimed at my demographic.  The real point is that \\"South Park\\" represents a vast move in the youth culture that viewers of \\"The West Wing\\" cannot find comfortable.<br /><br />I am quite impressed with the way Brian Anderson has reported on the ways in which conservative ideas are on the march and along the way finding new forms of expression and across a much broader expanse.<br /><br />While this has nothing to do with the message of the book, my own hope is that the social conservative message is not abandoned for an attempt to simply gather broad political power.  I still believe that the core of conservative power is the social message.  The economic truths are important, but they don't provide the beating heart that provides the life of the movement.  But that is my private view.<br /><br />This book deserves a lot of attention and the reporting it contains should provide a great deal of information for discussion and debate.<br /><br />Heartily Recommended.y NRO as well as the print version of the classic conservative magazine.

It covers the early period of European Discovery through the state of the Iraq War in fall 2004.  This means that things move along quite briskly.  This is true of all one-volume histories, but this one has some special strengths that recommend it.<br /><br />Each chapter of the book has a nice organization.  The first page or two is a summary introduction to the chapter.  If you wanted, you could skim the whole book in a few hours just reading the book in this short form.  You would cheat yourself of a lot, but you would get a clear idea of what is in each chapter of the book.  The authors then provide a Time Line of the main events covered in each chapter so the reader can associate events with, heaven forbid, dates!  I have never figured out why people want to study history without also learning dates.  So now, we have two or more generations of Americans who are unclear of the dates of our Revolution, the Civil War, even the two World Wars, or much else.  Sad really, but this book handles that problem nicely.<br /><br />After the chronology the main text of the chapter starts and takes us through the material of each chapter in clear and direct prose.  The presentation of the events and people also includes discussion of the positive and negative of the topic under discussion.  Interpretations by other historians are also included as are those items that are still ambiguous in our time.  For example, the events around the Kennedy assassination are treated, as are the confusions some have around Oswald's role in the murder.  While other interpretations and doubts about the Warren Commission Report are acknowledged, the role of Oswald is accepted while also stating that no explanation will ever satisfy those who continue to doubt his role.<br /><br />Throughout the book there are shaded sections that discuss a specific topic or person.  Examples of these are the discussion of Mike Fink, an early pioneer of the Ohio Valley, and the discussion of Roosevelt's advance knowledge of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (he didn't have any).  These side discussions are aptly chosen and quite helpful because they will send the reader on a hunt for more information that will deepen their appreciation for our history.<br /><br />I recommend this book very highly and strongly urge you to get the book for your library.  Anyone, from a bright 14 year old on up, can read this book easily and benefit from its many strengths.  There are NO pictures, but that is fine.  Images on these topics can be found on the Internet very easily.  Personally, I would have no trouble using this in my home to supplement what my children are not learning in school.<br /><br />Most importantly, the healthy attitude the authors bring towards America is indeed patriotic and strengthening to the reader.  The authors never ignore our flaws, but they put them in a proper context rather than drowning the uninitiated in a river of woe of all that is wrong with America.  Nor do they blame all the problems in the world on our rise to power.  Again, this is a great book for young people to use as a foundation in understanding their country and for mature adults to get their views clarified about how America actually came to be and the events and people who participated in the building of our great nation.<br /><br />Superb one volume history of America.ic topic or person.

He recounts many painful but apt anecdotes that show how General Motors, Ford, and the now German DaimlerChrysler have used unilateral pressure, patent violation, waived contractual obligations, and general hostility to alienate and destroy even longtime vendors in the pursuit of survival through lower costs.<br /><br />He contrasts that with the method Chrysler used during and after their near death experience when they had to rely on their suppliers to help them survive.  The author advocates a cooperative approach that depends on trust and sharing even proprietary information to develop a process of continual improvement in all areas including cost.  The chart on page 12 showing the supplier trust of Toyota and how Chrysler held close to that before the German takeover and how it has dropped severely since then.  Of course, DaimlerChrysler might counter with actual comparisons of underlying financial performance and say that the drop in trust, while unfortunate, had to be accepted to survive.<br /><br />I have worked as an assembler in a pickup truck plant, as a supplier of computer equipment and software to the automotive companies, and as a supplier of temporary staff and technical expertise as well.  My own view is that Mr. Stallkamp has a great deal of insight in the recommendations he makes.  I think, in many ways, the automotives are still prisoners of their unprecedented success in the their early decades and have found the culture change required surprisingly difficult to attain.  So, year after year they continue to lose market share and customer loyalty is almost gone.<br /><br />However, this book merely presents the idea of treating the supply chain as an extended enterprise that uses collaboration based on trust as a way of lowering costs while also improving quality.  There is no real case for implementation.  Nor does it try to tackle the problem the supplier has in working in multiple extended collaborative environments with multiple OEMs and the cost and waste that supporting multiple programs would entail.  I think this is because the author also has a consulting firm and this book is meant to draw people to the idea, while they have to pay to get the expertise to help in implementing the process.<br /><br />There is a bit of a mislabeling on page 208.  GM, Mazda, Ford, and Saturn are used twice as labels without DaimlerChrysler, Honda, Nissan, and Toyota (or whatever the other labels were supposed to be).  The graph doesn't really make sense the way it is presented.<br /><br />All in all, a good book with important ideas that can help improve the manufacturing environment in the United States.  This isn't the only true approach and, of course, when your house is on fire it isn't good to \\"just do something - anything\\" to try to deal with it.  However, the current approaches have not yet stanched the bleeding.

Robert Frost is a unique American voice that many people love.  A few reject him, but the majority of those whom he was writing for still love and admire his poetry.  His fans always have favorites and can quote lines and whole poems from memory.  When a poet gets into people's memories and hearts it is not a sure sign of greatness, but it is a good indicator of something special.<br /><br />In some ways his works have aged because they are about an America that has passed.  One poem that I think catches a lot of the issues surround Frost is \\"The Literate Farmer and the Planet Venus\\".  This piece is about the electrification of rural America and the strangeness of it all.  It talks about the speeding up of life and wonders if the future will simply do away with beds because there won't be time to sleep.  The poem is set in 1926, but was published in 1942 as part of \\"A Witness Tree\\".  I don't know when it was written, but if it was written around the Second World War its nostalgia seems a bit more cynical to me (which I suspect to be the case).  However, if it was written back in the late 1920s then it has more whimsy and an earnest wonder.<br /><br />This poet does have a capacity for irony and bite as well as humor and whimsy.  His words are more conversational than lyric and that is fine.  They have less music, but a great deal of color and subtle observation.  It really doesn't matter what any critic says about Frost.  He will outlast all of them.  What matters is what he says to you.  He is certainly a more worthwhile read than most of what gets published nowadays, just expect to have to deal with some words and references to an America from a century ago.<br /><br />This volume from the Library of America is terrific.  The table of contents in the front refers to the whole volume.  The Collected Poems is the reprint that takes up most of the book and has its own table of contents as well.  There is also a chronology of Frost's life, notes on sources, and many very helpful notes that can help you understand certain references.  There is an index of titles and first lines, and an index of prose titles.<br /><br />I always feel grateful to the Library of America whenever I get a chance to read their volumes.

Sadly, all those who were living during those years are leaving us all to rapidly.  Certainly, the living knowledge of the events and times is fading fast.  While we value the books great authors give us, we should treasure even more the writing given us at the time.  In volume one we have reporting from great journalists starting in 1938 Shirer's article on the Munich conference that gave Germany the Sudetenland.<br /><br />We get to follow the rise of Anti-Semitism in Germany with Kristallnacht, the fall of Poland and Paris.  The London Blitz is covered by Edward R. Murrow and more and more.  The United States doe not even enter the war until page 241 with the Herald Tribune's reporting of Roosevelt's \\"War Message\\".<br /><br />The reporting also takes us into the Pacific and gets us down with those doing the actual work of the war including Annalee Jacoby's account of nurses under fire in Bataan.  We get early reporting on the Japanese Internment camps and the Holocaust with the NY Times reporting in 1942 that one million Jews reported slain.<br /><br />There is a section of fine photos of the reporters included and others in the text including some aerial shots from a bomber's point of view.  This first volume ends with the Mountain Campaign in Italy in 1944.

It is wonderful to have this collection of reporting from those years.  Too often, people remember their history from Hollywood movies, where everything is glorious, simple, and victory is assured in the end.  In real life, there is chaos, a determination to endure, but victory is not known until it is finally attained.<br /><br />This volume picks up in Italy during 1944 and ends with victory in the Pacific and the aftermath of Hiroshima.  There are articles on the Battle of the Bulge, Iwo Jima, the death of F.D.R, the death of Ernie Pyle in the Pacific from a sniper's bullet,  the German surrender, and dozens more.<br /><br />One of the most touching is an extended piece on the Japanese Internment camps with pen and ink drawings by one of the Japanese.  Bill Mauldin also has a piece in here with his famous WWII cartoons of the GIs at the front.  William Laurence gives a famous account of the bombing of Nagasaki on August 9, 1945.<br /><br />There is a section of fine photos of the reporters included and others in the text including some aerial shots from a bomber's point of view.

A huge number of regular folks read about the American Civil War (or whatever other name you want to give it), both World Wars, the Revolutionary War, and other important events in American history.  Our Vietnam experience is very hard for the living generations to investigate for a number of reasons.  One reason is that those of us who were alive during the 60s and 70s and at least teenagers all developed strongly held views and emotional commitments to a position on the war.  Revisiting those years with the kind of open mind required by serious scholarship requires more strength than most of us mere mortals can muster.<br /><br />However, I believe emphatically that it is time to do so.  It seems clear to me that much of what was being fed to Americans via the media was couched to promote an anti-war view.  Yes, it is true that the press, say, in WWII was more uniformly supported the war effort (but not as completely as is remembered today), but the point in both instances is that we reach a point in time when it is essential to go back, examine the evidence with fresh eyes and an open heart, and get as close to the truth as we can.<br /><br />This book is one of those treasures that provides essential primary information that none of us had access to previously.  This book provides edited transcripts of tapes made of various briefings and meetings of General Creighton Abrams when he was the commander of US forces in Vietnam from 1968-72.  It makes surprisingly fascinating reading.  You do have to get used to some of the military terminology, but the author does provide helps for the reader.  There is some introductory material, and guide to all the participants in the back with their full names, titles, and the dates of their service.  There is an essential guide to all the acronyms as well.  And of course there is a useful index.<br /><br />It is painful to read these accounts as they struggled to manage the war effort, getting the right forces in place, reacting to bad reporting back home, and their reactions events and politicians back home.  There are a couple of quotes that I think that struck me especially forcefully.<br /><br />The first is between Abrams and his boss, Admiral John McCain (father of our Senator John McCain) pg 573:<br /><br />McCain: \\"I think when this d___ thing comes out in clear writing sometime, maybe 5 or 10 years from now, you're  going to find out that we were a g__d___ sight closer to some sort of a successful conclusion to this d___ thing than the politicians and newspapers in the United States won't [sic] admit, and a few other things.\\"<br />Abrams: \\"I thought we'd read that in your memoirs.\\"<br />McCain: \\"I'm not going to write any g__d___ memoirs.  I decided that a long time ago.\\" \\"Sure going to be interesting to see what some other people say about me in their memoirs, though.  I hope I'm around long enough to read some of them.\\"<br />Abrams: (serious, not joking): \\"Well, I think on that score, Admiral, none of us can hope for any of that to be good.\\"<br />McCain: \\"Memoirs won't be read if they're good.  That's a fact.  I can tell you that right now.\\"<br /><br />What have we done as a country to make such dedicated men who have sacrificed so much of their lives on our behalf to have to eat that much pain?<br /><br />Then at the end of the book when Abrams is leaving, Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker provides these comments to him pg 877-8:<br /><br />Abrams: \\"Mr. Ambassador?\\"<br />Bunker: \\"Yes, I'd like to say a word, General Abrams.  When you and I came here, a little more than give years ago, I was hoping we could exit together.  I just want to say that these five years I think have had the most rewarding of a fairly long career that began with the horse artillery in 1916.  And they certainly have been fateful years, for the Republic of Vietnam and for our own country.  I suppose, when the history of this war is written, it willbe very clear that no country ever put as many restraints on itself as we did.  And I think it's been probably the most difficult war that we've ever tried to fight.  And it's been fateful for our country, because I think the question is whether we have the patience and the determination and the will to accept the responsibilities of power.\\"<br /><br />There is more to this statement, but that will do for my purposes.<br /><br />We can learn from history, and we are now in a situation in Iraq where we are also being tested in much the same way by some on the home front.  We will see if we \\"we have the patience and the determination and the will to accept the responsibilities of power.\\"  I pray we do.<br /><br />A fabulous contribution to scholarship and can add a great deal to your own understanding of this middle period of the Vietnam War.nd I think it's been probably the most difficult war that we've ever tried to fight.

These eight traits are:<br /><br />-Building a strong corporate culture<br />-Truth Telling<br />-Finding and catering to under-served markets<br />-\\"Seeing the invisible\\" - that is, spotting potential winners or faint trends before their rivals or customers do.<br />-Using price to build competitive advantage<br />-Managing and building their organization's brand (which, in some cases, may be their own name)<br />-Being fast learners<br />-Managing Risk<br /><br />These traits as a group are not discussed directly by the 25 business leaders, although interviews for this book were conducted with about two thirds of the leaders.  Instead, each of these traits is given one chapter (plus one introductory chapter and one for conclusion for a total of ten).  Andy Grove is given the top spot and discussed separately.  The other chapters use a single incident or strategy from two or three of the business people selected for the book.  I like the way the stories of the business people are organized.  First, the Challenge is presented.  The Leadership Lesson is then presented.  Along the margins of the Challenge section is a chronology of major dates and events in the life of the person being discussed.<br /><br />What is nice about this approach is that you get a variety of \\"case studies\\" to illustrate the point the authors are making.  The brevity of the case studies makes for easy reading and the authors make their points clearly and succinctly.  However, such condensed treatment of complex business issues cannot help but oversimplify realities quite a bit.  For example, the authors take Steve Jobs from the Apple II to the macintosh.  However, there was the Lisa before the mac, even if only a few of us remember it today.  The Lisa had the graphic operating system first and had those weird and wonderful variable speed Twiggy drives.  But everyone would (or should) know this kind of simplifying has to be done and it is an acceptable tradeoff for the lessons the book is trying to teach.<br /><br />I am sure that everyone will have different reactions to the vast range of people included.  Some will be your heroes.  Some you may not know very well.  And others you may not think well of.  I had that reaction to the range of people in this book.  However, I really enjoyed reading through it and thinking about what the authors were saying.<br /><br />Good business book.day.

He starts the book providing a discussion of what he considers to be the myths about Islam including that its name means Peace.  The word Islam means submission.  He also demonstrates that the Quran itself permits violence against unbelievers (infidels).<br /><br />Sperry does a great job in deconstructing the dissembling by Muslim spokesmen when they criticize terrorism against civilians.  It sounds like they are supporting the US in the War on Terror.  In reality, no non-Muslim American is a civilian in their eyes and the attacks are not considered terrorism.  It is just war against an enemy of Islam.  Sperry notes that their speeches in English almost never match what they say in Arabic in the mosques and in their speeches to their supporters.<br /><br />The author also explodes the myth that the 9/11 terrorists did not receive support and help within US borders.  He went to investigate where those terrorists who were based in Virginia lived.  Sperry found a sizeable and very active Islamic community where some of the 9/11 perpetrators lived among those that shared similarly radical views.  In this book we get a look at various mosques and imams within America that spread the message of an Islamic overthrow of the United States.  When you hear them say the love America - it is an Islamic America that they love.<br /><br />We also get to see how a fear of being seen as anti-Islamic has compromised our intelligence gathering, our security, our politics, and our ability to speak the plain truth.  It is painful to read about government employees bringing middle eastern celebratory dishes to work after 9/11 speaking openly that it is about time \\"they\\" get some payback.  The author does a good job in taking us through the whole gamut of compromises, from our discussions of Islam all the way through the White House and how this radical threat continues to grow almost completely unchecked.<br /><br />If you want some hard information on this topic, this is a good book to read.row almost completely unchecked.

To those already imprisoned in cynicism this book will read like a bunch of soft platitudes suitable only for children, but worse than useless to anyone trying to make it in the \\"real world\\".  Of course, the cynics are not objectively correct.  Cynicism and bad behavior are only necessary when you deem them to be the tools of your trade.  If you decide that lying really is a losing long term strategy and that short run gains aren't worth long term losses, well, lying becomes a stupidity and easily avoided.<br /><br />This is not to say that the kind of honorable behavior Huntsman advocates in this book leads to easy business success or a world of bright flowers and constant sunshine.  Far from it!  Competition is still tough and things still go wrong.  It is simply how you compete and what you do to get things right that matter.  These \\"everyday\\" values make for a more sustainable success that lead to better personal interactions, trust, and a more enjoyable life for everyone.  Business failure is unpleasant, but it is transient.  Corrupting your character for short term success is bitter and not easily undone.<br /><br />Huntsman fills this short book with anecdotes from his own successful career.  We learn about lessons he learned in the Nixon Whitehouse working on HR Haldeman's staff.  The author describes how he handled various negotiations for rather large business deals.  He tells us that lawyers are invaluable as business tools, but not as a substitute for business thinking or creativity.  He describes his personal relations with a few business leaders of large companies.<br /><br />In a couple of these I feel he raises some questions that are never directly addressed.  For example, he describes the Chairman of Royal Dutch Shell as a friend without addressing what the huge and expensive reserves write down implies about the leader's character and leadership ability.  He also mentions Armand Hammer as a friend!  All I can suggest is to read about Mr. Hammer's true character in Edward Jay Epstein's terrific \\"Dossier\\".  It is actually frightening to contemplate these two men being actual friends.  I have to assume that Mr. Huntsman was simply using friend as a polite title the way Congressional enemies refer to each other as \\"my good friend\\".  They could not possibly share genuine ideals and have anything in this book actually mean anything.<br /><br />It is also clear that Mr. Huntsman has no use for Wall Street bankers.  He must have hand some bad experiences in dealing with them.  This makes me wonder why he ended up taking his company public.  I also wonder if the bankers who helped him do so were honorable in his eyes or of low character.  If they were honorable, shouldn't he have noted the exception in his book?  If they were scumbags, why didn't he walk away from the deal?<br /><br />Mr. Huntsman also makes a huge point of charitable giving.  His personal example is inspiring and demonstrates what considered and generous giving can do to lift people and benefit communities.  He also is unsparing of the notion that public corporations should be focused on profits for their shareholders.  Mr. Huntsman says that as long as he is running Huntsman Chemical it will be doing charitable giving.  This begs a thought experiment.  Let's suppose that Mr. Huntsman were to retire, but still live a long, robust, and healthy retirement.  Let's suppose that a chairman appointed by the board should decide, for personal reasons, to donate millions of Huntsman Chemical's dollars to anti-Mormon causes (Huntsman is a believing and faithful Mormon).  Would this seem sensible or appropriate to Mr. Huntsman?  That the person who did this would be immediately fired is beside the point.  That shareholders in widely held firms have diverse interests apart from the management of the firm they own and that they are perfectly capable of their own charitable giving is really the point.  When Huntsman chemical was a private and closely held firm, its giving was his business.  Now that it is a publicly held firm, it is a different creature and has to act differently.  There is a reason that I am more and more in favor of more firms staying private.<br /><br />Two other short points.  Two honest people with good intentions can still come out with different interpretations of simple English statements.  I know this can all be avoided with careful negotiation, good contract writing and so forth.  My point is that the fact of a powerful and even bitter disagreement is not necessarily evidence of bad character on the part of either side.  It might well be that one or both of the parties is a ratbag, but they could both be good people who strongly disagree.  This is important to note as you go about your business career and simply make sure to take extra steps to avoid such painful disagreements through prevention.<br /><br />The second point is that I wish Mr. Huntsman had gone one step further.  It is true that bad managers and dishonesty caused the financial tragedies at Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, Adelphia, and others.  However, who hired them?  Why were they hired?  Shareholders hired them by investing their money in these firms looking for the big returns.  Those who lost money investing in equity in these firms are not innocent.  They helped create an environment where the solid management teams of older less explosive firms were cast aside for the go-go huge return firms of the nineties.<br /><br />We hired these clowns and they delivered the lies we asked them to tell us because they agreed with the lies we were telling ourselves about the likelihood of these huge returns.  It is actually a dishonesty to simply blame the CEOs who ran these firms.  Oh, they deserve every punishment they get.

Oded Shenkar is particularly good in discussing the difficulties in measuring the economic production and trade flows in today's almost borderless manufacturing.  For example, even measuring the size of the trade deficit between the US and China isn't completely clear because of what is included and what is not included (services, for example).<br /><br />Dr. Shenkar also notes that the same process of migrating low cost labor from country to country (the US to Japan to Korea to China) will likely stop in China for quite awhile.  Their vast population will allow the current rural population to urbanize over time and function as a country within a country as the current manufacturing centers move upscale.<br /><br />The fundamental issue for currently developed countries is figuring out where to go on the economic food chain as China tries to dominate in every area from making socks to cars to airplanes to spacecraft.  The world has not seen such global impact from a growing country since the growth of the United States in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.<br /><br />While it is true that the United States and Europe have no inevitable guarantee of continued prosperity or a standard of living vastly higher than the rest of the world, I do think it is awfully premature to assume linear progress for China into the distant future.  Japan's sudden stall in what seemed a sure path to continued growth in prosperity is very complex, but part of it was due to the fact that the rising generation that had been raised in relative wealth simply did not want to work as hard as their parents had.  They wanted to enjoy the fruits of wealth.<br /><br />China will eventually face the same risks.  There will also be internal divisions and resentments as wealth becomes unequal or is confiscated and misspent by a central authority trying to make things equal.  China's path to a dominant future is not clear or guaranteed.  They have a lot in their favor, to be sure.  However, history has taught us that there is a pull in humans that can lead to costly internal divisions.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the US and the West face a most serious situation that simply must be addressed.  The area where this book is not as strong, in my view, is in its discussion of economics and foreign trade.  Dr. Shenkar seems to think that comparative advantage is an opinion rather than a reality.  He actually talks about the \\"fair trade\\" movement as if it is a serious economic idea rather than a political tactic.  History has taught us that dislocations are inevitable and always painful for those caught in the gears of change.  We have also learned that trying to stall these changes never works in the long run.  Instead, these delays simply make the dislocations more severe when they inevitably occur and make consumers worse off.<br /><br />Dr. Shenkar is absolutely correct when he points out that those losing their jobs in industries such as textiles and furniture are unlikely to be the same ones employed in the new industries that rise to take their place.  It seems to me that the real policies we need to develop are about making the cost of these dislocations more of a shared burden in our economy rather than throwing all of the cost on the workers and businesses directly affected.  Such an approach will allow the dislocations to happen more smoothly (if the government doesn't overpay and create greater and artificial closings and idle workers because they won't need to seek work) and allow new industries to rise in areas where they will be most competitive rather than trying to provide work in areas simply because of an existing but idle workforce.  People can move to the work and have done it over and over again throughout our history!  We have a great highway system.<br /><br />This isa good book and makes serious points.  I think it is best in its analysis of the present and somewhat less sound in its discussion of approaches to the future.<br /><br />Recommended./> <br />This is a good book and makes serious points.

In this skilful and intelligent biography of Charles Ponzi, Mitchell Zuckoff shows us Ponzi's character flaws, his charisma, how he developed his scheme(s), and how the enemies he made brought him down.<br /><br />Charles Ponzi was born Carlo Ponzi in 1882 in the town of Lugo, Italy.  His family sacrificed to send him to a prestigious university where he fell in with rich kids whose lifestyle he enjoyed.  In trying to keep with them he ended up having to leave school without finishing.  His family sent him to America where the streets were paved with gold, so they told him.  Of course, like most Italian immigrants of the time, he had hard times.  However, hard work was distasteful to him.<br /><br />This combination of a desire to live rich lifestyle combined with a disdain for hard work and an impatience to build wealth led him, predictably, to problems with the law.  He was obsessed with get-rich-quick schemes.  Then came the lightening bolt.  In 1920, he saw an International Reply Coupon.  These coupons were merely meant to provide prepaid return postage for international mail.  Let's say I sent a vendor in a foreign country a contract.  I could include the appropriate coupon so my vendor could return the signed contract at my expense.<br /><br />Ponzi had about 1/3 of a good idea (noticing the mispricings between the currency exchange rates and the fixed priced coupons).  He knew that there were mispricings in these coupons because of the currency devaluations in certain currencies after the Great War.  So, all he had to do was buy coupons that were under priced, turn them into stamps, turn the stamps into cash, and he would have oceans of money!  So, he plunged ahead without  bothering to work out all the details in his scheme.  But he needed cash to start the ball rolling.  The solution was Ponzi notes.  He offered 50% interest on your money in 45 - 90 days.  He found the first few \\"investors\\" and when he paid on time, money began flowing in.  Soon it was a torrent of cash.  It wasn't long before Ponzi had an ocean of money; millions of dollars.  He was big news and a hero to many.  He developed a patter noting how he was making all this happen for the little guy because he didn't care about money whereas banks took all their profits for their shareholders.<br /><br />Zuckoff writes a fascinating account of how Ponzi tried to find a way of going \\"legit\\" while he robbed Peter to pay Paul as he stalled for time.  Unfortunately for Ponzi, his sudden and shocking success brought unwanted attention from government and media types including the Boston Post.  It is kind of funny how things went bad for Ponzi because the people who were after him had less of a clue than he did (except for C.W. Barron - the financial writer).  The author also shows us the one true thing in Ponzi's life, his love for his wife, Rose.<br /><br />It is hard to feel too sorry for those ending up losing money in this scheme.  They were also going after quick riches and even under the best of circumstances high return investments also have high risks of losing everything.  Of course, Ponzi's scheme was no investment, and it was all risk.  There was never much of a chance that it would ever do anything but crash.  Although, I couldn't figure out why he didn't try gradually lowering his interest rate and extending the return period.  It doesn't matter.  Those after him were going to bring him down anyway.<br /><br />The book takes us through the trials and jail terms.  Ponzi's fame had made him too politically profitable to be left alone or punished only once.  His life ends sadly as do the lives of a few of those who built their careers going after him.  It seems to me this book would make a fabulous movie or mini-series.  However, you would have to find just the right actor to pull off Ponzi's greatest assets: his confidenceand charm.  He was only five foot two so; the actor would also have to be short.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a terrifically entertaining read and I recommend it.actor would also have to be short.

It is writing about food, and does provide recipes that you can try on your own, but its real delight comes from writing about the people who made those recipes and whose life is about making really good food.  And the writer needs to be able to write skillfully enough to enable to reader to taste that food along with him.<br /><br />John T. Edge does a great job in this little book.  He takes a dish we all think we know and uses what he calls its iconic status to show how such a common dish is really a window into the larger and more diverse culture.  It can't help being adapted to local conditions and tastes or from the points of origin of the fry cook.  In this book he takes us all around the country.  We get to go to a Church Social, meet with legendary chicken chefs, go to famous chicken joints.  Edge shows us chicken straight up, with varying degrees of spice, with flavors of Asia, Europe, and several South of the Border.<br /><br />All the while, the author ties it in to various aspects of all the cultures involved and how it has all melded into America.  He never loses sight of the fact that this dish had slavery as one of its points of origin.  There is a fascinating account of how newly freed women slaves would fry up chicken and wait by the train stations to sell it to hungry (and often smoke ash covered) passengers.  This culture kept on for quite awhile and recipes and cooking methods were jealously guarded.<br /><br />If you love food and enjoy reading about food and culture, you will get a lot from this delightful book.  I was fortunate to attend a chicken dinner with the author at Zingerman's Roadhouse here in Ann Arbor, MI last week.  I could never have imagined the broad range of tastes I was fortunate to experience from Fried Chicken.  Mr. Edge was a most interesting speaker and a very friendly gentleman.<br /><br />Enjoy!	2005-03-30

I am not talking about the points where I disagree with the author, but internal weaknesses and inconsistencies.  My view is that if the author makes a strong case for his views, whether or not I agree with him or her, I generally value the book for making me think.<br /><br />This is a book of advocacy for a dream.  The author claims it is a book of optimism and yet the only optimism I could find was a kind of sentiment that at long, long last Malthus could be right.  The reasons Malthusian pessimism has always been wrong are well documented.  I have a great deal of confidence that they will continue to be wrong, but that is a debate for another day.<br /><br />Where I think the author is strongest is when he is pointing out that as populations reach certain densities they do indeed have an impact upon where they live.  An example I like to use is the way London suffered from cholera epidemics once it reached a certain size.  They suffered these because they had always drained raw sewerage into their rivers and streams as a way of getting rid of waste.  This worked as long as there weren't many people.  However, once the population density reached a certain level they ended up poisoning themselves.  So, they finally built sewers and treated the waste.<br /><br />Improvements continue to be made.  Humans are not helpless in the face of problems, but first they have to understand clearly what they are facing and then have the will to fix it.  I do like his notion that pollution is the evidence of waste and poor management.  He is also correct, I believe, that in the long run it will not be enough to simply make our present ways more \\"green\\", but will require a revolution in the way we manufacture, and what we build.  However, I am also convinced that the current regime of attacking the economy through lawsuits and regulation will have little impact on global pollution.  It will simply hollow out certain economies and push the pollution elsewhere.  Rather, it has to be made economically advantageous to pollute less rather than making pollution more costly.  Being \\"sustainable\\" (whatever that really could mean) has to be a better way of doing business to win, otherwise it won't ever come about.<br /><br />I think the author is also strong in his view that providing goods and services to the four billion people at the Bottom of the Pyramid (BOP) and doing that profitably will have benefits at multiple levels.  The poorest of the poor will have improved lives, the physical environment will improve, and the wealthier nations will gain not only profits, but improved methods and technology for their own way of life.<br /><br />Where I think Prof. Stuart misses the mark is that he relies far too much on arguing from authority rather than hard intellectual demonstration of his ideas.  He cites this authority or that NGO or another study to make his points.  Yet, if you don't agree with the authorities already, how is that convincing?  And if you already agree with his dream, why do we need the book?  I am also profoundly tired of business books that cite the beginning of an initiative as proof that an idea works or that early stage results are conclusive.  Getting something started or ginning up good results early is proof of nothing.  To capture Prof Hart's term, good ideas are proven by being SUSTAINABLE over a long period of time.  Early results and startup initiatives are not all that persuasive to anyone with real world experience.<br /><br />An even more serious problem is internal inconsistency.  In most of the book he talks about providing new technologies and methods for improving the life of the poor (while weirdly railing against the \\"money economy\\").  Then on page 166 he condemns the way the Westernizing of the Ladakhi people has hurt them.  He laments that their population had been stable for centuries and now it is increasing too fast and their communallifestyle has become too urban and impersonal with real poverty.<br /><br />While I don't like to see anyone suffer either, Prof. Stuart misses a key point about why the population was stable for centuries.  The simple fact is people died.  If we let more children die, let women die in childbirth, and kill off the men earlier through backbreaking work and disease, well, all populations will be stable at a lower level.  The fact is the technologies he is praising will inevitably increase the population.  People want to have posterity.  So, whose children are going to die?  Who is willing to die early?  Yours?  Professor Hart's?  I didn't think so.<br /><br />His title is also very misleading.  Prof. Hart does not like capitalism at all.  He likes a kind of socialized corporation that is somehow guided by all kinds of stakeholders.  If you want economic failure and poverty, this is a sure path, in my view.<br /><br />Still, it is interesting to read these ideas.

It is not that we will all be reduced to the lowest rung of the ladder, but that the high technology and super efficiencies required to reach the four billion people at the bottom of the period will have to inform what we build and the ways we build them in the rich countries as well.<br /><br />Prof. Prahalad and his students do a fine job of addressing what the Bottom Of the Pyramid  (BOP) represents, the opportunities, the challenges, and their view of what the requirements for success will be.  The book is in three parts.  The first section is six chapters describing the market, the kinds of products the BOP needs, the evidence for it being a global market, the ecosystem for wealth creation (this is mostly the environment of government, regulation, banking, finance, AND the physical environment), the revolution in low cost transactions that is already underway to reduce corruption, and the social transformation all of this can represent.<br /><br />The second part of the book is a series of case studies illustrating the principles and ideas discussed in the first section.  I found the case studies fascinating.  The cases are about bringing housing to people living in flimsy huts, innovative encapsulated iodized salt, introducing affordable soap for washing hands and improving health, a special prosthetic foot that meets the special needs in India (they don't wear shoes in certain places and sit on the ground - western prosthetics don't work well in those situations and they cost too much), an approach to eye surgery based on McDonalds methods of training and standardization that is bringing eyesight to hundreds of thousands at 1/10th the cost (or less) of Western care, and others.<br /><br />Frankly, as I read these things I thought about how Sears and others made fortunes brining more affordable goods and finance to rural and poor areas in American a century or so ago.  It really is a lot like that.  However, our urbanization and wealth have caused us to forget that kind of innovation at home.  It delights me that it exists wherever you have smart people in hard circumstances with even a small amount of freedom.<br /><br />The third part of the book is a series of videos on a CD that illustrate these cases.  The videos are very well done and bring the power of the cases to life.<br /><br />A fine book on a topic that should be considered by all, but especially by businesspeople.ers.  <br /> <br />Frankly, as I read these things I thought about how Sears and others made fortunes brining more affordable goods and finance to rural and poor areas in American a century or so ago.

An ocean of knowledge to explore in 1 vol	It is clear that I love books, learning, and just the simple act of reading.  While there are whole sections of the bookstore I will never enter, I do read rather broadly.  Even so, there are some books that I find so stunning that I marvel to even hold them in my hands.  This book, \\"The Road to Reality\\" by Roger Penrose is one of those books.  It is a wonderful achievement and a gift to every one of us.<br /><br />It has a breadth to it that is quite unique.  No matter how specialized you are, even if you have a Ph.D. in mathematics, this book covers so many topics that you will find yourself reading as a generalist saying to yourself, \\"Yeah, that's neat, I always wanted to learn a bit more about that.\\"  And while there is much there for the advanced specialist, it is written in such a way that a person with just an ordinary exposure to mathematics can ignore the math notation (equations) and still get a huge value from reading the text.<br /><br />This book allows you to dip into it here and there without having to read it front to back.  If the ordinary book on cosmology is like taking a trip across an inland lake in a boat, this magnificent volume is like having an ocean to explore.  There is a wonderful primer on the roots of science, an exploration of the mathematics based on the Greeks, number theory, logarithms, various forms of calculus, Fourier hyperfunctions, hypercomplex numbers, symmetry groups, and then on to physics.<br /><br />Penrose gives us the basics of spacetime, 4 space geometry, Lagrangians and Hamiltonians, quantum particles, quantum algebra, the standard model of particle physics, quantum field theory, an examination of the Big Bang and other speculative theories of the early universe, gravity, and much more.  He ends with a wonderful section on \\"Where lies the road to reality\\".  I particularly admire his modesty in stating his feeling that we are not \\"just about there\\" in wrapping up physics and that our current best lines of thinking may all indeed be dead ends.  Nevertheless even the dropping of a theory represents an advance in knowledge.<br /><br />You can spend years with this book and should.  There are probably four audiences for this book.  The advanced specialist who wants to read in areas connected to but other than his expertise, the student (or teacher) who wants to get some context for and supplement to their studies, the generalist (like me) who loves the challenge of learning new things and exploring challenging thought, and someone who simply values having something marvelous on their bookshelf in the odd chance that having all this wonder in one volume might prove valuable one day.<br /><br />While I could only give \\"The Road to Reality\\" five stars, I really view it as a six star event.  I recognize that this book is not for everyone, but if you enjoy intellectual mountaineering this is a wonderful peak to climb..

It is one of those terms that everyone needs to know something about in order to be connected to the larger culture.  You don't have to agree with it or believe, but you need to know about it.  This book is a terrific way to gain an overview of the theory, its history, and its connection to the history of astronomy since Ptolemy and the earth centered universe.<br /><br />\\"The Big Bang\\" is a terrific read because Simon Singh is an exceptionally talented writer who is able to open even arcane subjects for the general reader.  He has a special gift for knowing just how much a subject needs to be simplified while leaving it just challenging enough to make the reader think a bit and puzzle things out in order to appreciate the intellectual change the new insight represents.  Mr. Singh also humanizes the story by keeping the men and women who made these discoveries front and center.<br /><br />It is the human rivalries, their mistakes, and their genius that attracts us and keeps us turning the pages to find out what happens next.  And what a cast this book has.  Just some of the big names are Ptolemy, Copernicus, Galileo, Brahe, Kepler, Newton, Hubble, Hoyle, and Einstein.  There are dozens of important names I am not listing here simply because they aren't as well known as they deserve to be.<br /><br />I love the story of how Eratosthenes made a pretty good calculation of the circumference of the earth using a stick, a well, some careful measurements, and trigonometry.  Once that distance is known, figuring out the size and distance of the moon and the Sun are not that hard.  Singh takes on a journey of expanding horizons, difficult intellectual puzzles, ever better observations, and hypotheses that get confirmed or drop away.<br /><br />Fred Hoyle and his Steady State model is presented as a hero and a genius in this story.  You can read the book to learn more about this model and its modifications.  However, you should know that it was Hoyle who solved the problem of how the heavier elements are synthesized in stars.  It involved an excited state of carbon that had more mass than regular carbon 12.  Singh feels that Hoyle was shamefully treated in his later years and from what we read here it is easy to agree.<br /><br />Singh informs us that proponents for a quasi-steady state model still exist.  However, after COBE and WMAP have confirmed the variation in the background radiation that would indicate an uneven state in the early universe that allowed for the formation of galaxies and other structures, Singh says the current weight of evidence is strongly in favor of \\"The Big Bang\\".<br /><br />This really is a fine book for the general reader.  Unless you are already fully conversant in cosmology, this book can add to your knowledge and is a very enjoyable read.<br /><br />I don't say this often, but I believe everyone should read this book.s a hero and a genius in this story.

This is book provides solid information that I think every American would be better off knowing.  It is decidedly not an alarmist banging of a jingoist drum as some have claimed.  Ted Fishman provides us with fine reporting of a broad view of the new China and the way its prodigious growth simply realigns its place in the world by force of its gargantuan scale.  This is a scale we in America have not yet grasped because we have become so used to being the largest economy in the world and the dominance that generates.<br /><br />We all know that China has over a billion people.  The official count is something like 1.2 or 1.3 billion.  However, many authorities on the subject believe there is a huge uncounted transient population that goes uncounted.  They put the population at 1.5 or 1.6 billion.  That means that a population as large as the United States is going uncounted in China.  Staggering.  The United States has dozens of cities of a million people or larger.  China has hundreds of cities with more than a million people.<br /><br />China's furious growth has implications on the pollution other countries experience.  We add cost to our economies and worry about quality of environment, yet how much of it is undone in developed Asian economies and our west coast because of the pollution falling from the atmosphere that originated in China.  It seems that the environmental groups should focus real effort putting pressure on Beijing.<br /><br />It is not that America cannot cope with a China whose economy passes ours in size, we have adapted in the past.  We beat off the Japanese threat.  However, Japan is half our size, without resources, and is not militarized.  China has a population four to five times our size and one that is hard working and becoming increasing well educated.  China is also rich with resources or has them nearby.  Australia has entered into huge long term contracts to provide all kinds of natural resources to China and is in many ways becoming more aligned with them than with us.  We have a huge task of seriously rethinking our focus as a nation, the level of education we expect from our citizens, and the kind of innovation we can foster and maintain.<br /><br />Mr. Fishman provides many interesting stories illustrating the present chaotic growth within China and the effects it is having on China's neighbors.  The way this massive explosion of industrial growth is hollowing out our manufacturing base is treated late in the book, which provides a convincing context because we see how even jobs from Mexico are going to China.  Jobs went from the US to Mexico because wages there were one seventh of those here.  They are leaving Mexico for China because Chinese workers make one quarter of the Mexicans.<br /><br />Surely, China could implode.  Or their rising internal demand and the rising (relative) wealth of their citizenry will erode their labor cost advantages.  However, there is also the reality of a similarly huge population in India.  Our world is changing rapidly.  We cannot count on our primary position in the world continuing from the inertia of the past century.  This book is a wonderful primer on what we are facing and we need to summon our energies and confidence and face this future expecting success because we will pay the price rather than simply sinking passively into a second rate status.<br /><br />One of the interesting ironies is that the lower prices we experience on our goods from China help offset some of the losses of manufacturing base.  They also help the purchasing power of those workers displaced to poorer jobs because of that same migration of work overseas.<br /><br />However, China isn't simply about loading up Wal-Mart with cheap goods.  It is taking on the very highest ends of technology as well.  From complex industrial machinery and software to the exploration of Space (and a promised mission to the Moon), China is reaching to become dominant in every aspect of the world economy.  We simply must take this seriously.<br /><br />I certainly don't have any pat answers, but I am confident we have everything we need to meet the challenge if we have the will to do it.  The existence of that will is what we have to demonstrate.  As always, time will tell.<br /><br />Recommended with a bit of urgency.ertainly don't have any pat answers, but I am confident we have everything we need to meet the challenge if we have the will to do it.

There are a huge number of people on the left who should be opposing such a brutal dictator, except that he is supposedly a socialist / communist and providing for \\"all the people\\" rather than a few millionaire exploiters.  Of course, that is not true, but the fawning goes on nonetheless.<br /><br />Instead, the people who have fled Castro's brutal tyranny are denounced.  They are inconvenient to a liberal agenda that wants to believe that Castro's brand of socialism works.  So, these refugees are ignored as much as possible, mischaracterized as rich exploiters who only want to get back properties they had long ago stolen \\"from the people\\".  What nonsense!  For every well to do refugee, there are thousands with nothing who fled for a chance at freedom.  It is not an accident that so many Cuban refugees have done well in this country.  They wanted to be free and have taken full advantage of what freedom offers to those who work diligently.<br /><br />This useful book by Humberto Fontova, a child of the Cuban exile, is a cry of the heart.  It gives passionate voice to those heroes who were tortured and murdered by Fidel and Che.  He rails against the \\"useful idiots\\" who end up sustaining Castro's brutality.  He cites so many of our politicians who find this whole Cuban episode so inconvenient and who want it to simply go away.  These politicians and media elites denounce the exile community and try to discredit their voice in order to undermine its powerful political effect.<br /><br />Mr. Fontova makes clear the agony this community has faced in fleeing Cuba, their pride in their success in America, and their frustration with those who either wittingly or unwittingly help prop up Castro's vicious regime.  Does their hurt and passion take them too far?  Maybe.  The author believes in the Castro conspiracy to kill Kennedy.  Who knows?  I know that nearly every other voice in America is given its say to promote \\"diversity\\" no matter how deleterious their prescriptions for our country.  We should hear these people as well and then make our judgment.  I think this book is a good corrective for the way this community's voice has been ignored and mischaracterized in the mass media.<br /><br />It is better, I think, to hear the voices directly rather than characterized in an unsympathetic press.  So, give this book a read and take part in our national debate over our Cuba policy from a more fully informed stance.n its say to promote \\"diversity\\" no matter how deleterious their prescriptions for our country.

It is most often used as a textbook in doctoral courses in finance, not because advanced MBAs cannot read it, but because most MBA courses are taught in ways to create intuitions and use generalized models to teach them.  This book is focused more for an audience of what are known as \\"quants\\", that is those who focus on quantitative results and rely on and communicate more comfortably via mathematical formulas than trying to capture the ideas in words alone.<br /><br />Not that this book does not also use intuitions in discussing the various pricing and consumption models.  Of course it does.  However, it also describes the models via equations and discussions of those equations.  The author takes a conversational tone throughout the book.  In some ways, if you want a very structured explication of these materials, you might get a tad frustrated.  If you have some patience, though, the materials do get covered.<br /><br />The author does provide a basic list of mathematical prerequisites.  He says:  \\"I presume some exposure to undergraduate economics and statistics.  A reader should have seen a utility function, a random variable, a standard error, and a times series, should have some basic linear algebra and calculus, and should have solved a maximum problem by setting derivatives to zero.\\"  I agree with his last sentence in the preface: \\"The hurdles in asset pricing are really conceptual rather than mathematical\\".<br /><br />Cochrane's order of presentation is different than most texts on asset pricing.  He begins with the consumption model and uses it to derive the classic models that MBAs are normally taught (CAPM, ICAPM, and APT).  He rightly points out that the order of discovery of useful ideas is not a justification for the order of presentation.  The author also uses geometric diagrams to aid understanding.  They will aid the development of the proper intuitions for the more general student of finance, but the quantitative types will get all they need from the equations the book provides.<br /><br />While the book provides discussions of the standard pricing models, the author also provides us with a discussion of his own research, the habit persistence model, in the final chapter (pp 456-73).  The model is a refinement of the equity premium by accounting for the effect of agent preferences.<br /><br />  If you are interested in finance at this level, this is book useful and not intensely difficult.  I always find it interesting to think through how much of these models describes the way the world should work versus the way the models describe the way the world does work.  Everyone has a different view on this subject.  To enjoy this book you simply have to have some prerequisites and take some time to actually read it rather than flip through the pages in the hope that understanding can come passively.

It is important to read widely enough, both in breadth of scope and time, to provide a rich and useful understanding of how things have become what they are.  While we cannot read everything, let alone retain it all in our memory, there are certain times, events, and even single lives that can provide valuable structure to our understanding of the world.<br /><br />In my view, knowing more about the history of Great Britain can help Americans understand more about our origins as a nation, provide a richer context for our founding, get a better fix on our own place in the world through time, and how we grew into a dominant power in the world.  This particularly fine biography of William Pitt the Younger concerns itself with the time immediately after Britain's American Colonies became the United States up to Pitt's death in 1806 in the middle of the Napoleonic Wars.<br /><br />This is an especially rich time in history because everything was in flux and so much was at risk.  The French Revolution of 1789 soon became The Terror.  Great Britain struggled to recover from the blow of losing her American Colonies and putting herself forward as a still relevant global power.  The United States actually benefited in many ways from the Europeans being so absorbed in fighting each other in these decades.  However, that is a story for another time.<br /><br />William Pitt the Younger was the extraordinary second son of the also extraordinary William Pitt.  The father dominated the House of Commons for many years including the time during the American Revolution.  He was universally loved as The Great Commoner and retired as a Lord.  William the Younger was endowed with certain intellectual gifts in fabulous abundance.  He had a tremendous capacity for oratory.  He trained himself by reading the Classics in Latin and Greek.  He learned mathematics particularly as it related to finance.  And of course he learned by observing his father's work in Parliament and in discussions with him.  He focused his whole life and all his energies to service in the House of Commons with a view only on the position of greatest power.<br /><br />Britain was adrift when Pitt came to Parliament.  Great things were expected of him and his early speeches confirmed his gifts.  He sought front line leadership from the beginning and due to his gifts and unique circumstances he became First Lord of the Treasury (what later became Prime Minister) at twenty-four years old.  He soon earned the favor of a strong majority and through his scrupulous dealings became known as Honest Billy.  He was one of the first to use the rapidly growing newspaper industry as a tool to govern through the development of his image.<br /><br />He put Britain's finances back in order, protected the monarchy during George the III's bouts of madness, and deftly handled all the governmental issues of the empire including issues involving India and the great trading companies.  He completely dominated the Whigs and led the way to the founding of the modern Conservative (Tory) party.  He finally resigned after 17 years in power.  He did so for many reasons, but the issue that seemed to provoke it was Catholic Emancipation, which the King refused to even consider because he considered it a violation of his duty as King and Head of the Established Church.<br /><br />Also, Pitt's health was beginning to fail.  He had dedicated his whole life to the service of his country and the maintenance of his power and dominance in the House of Commons and the strain was beginning to tell.  Pitt never married nor did he develop a new circle of friends or wider interests during his time in power, which was essentially his whole life from his early twenties until his death at forty-six.  Hague has some keen observations on the way serving in high political office has the effect of freezing a person at that stage of life until they leave power.  Pitt is one of the most extreme examples of this effect.<br /><br />At the zenith of Pitt's power the French Revolution occurred and was soon followed by the calamity of the Napoleonic Wars.  While he led Britain through the wars ably, his gifts for war were not as sure as his gifts for finance.  Another issue that he confronted during his time in office was the issue of abolishing the slave trade.  Neither the ending the wars nor, nor Catholic Emancipation, nor abolishing the slave trade was accomplished during his lifetime.<br /><br />Pitt chose Addington as his successor.  The response of others can be understood through a little couplet.  \\"Pitt is to Addington as London is to Paddington\\".  He returned to power within a few years, but died in office in less than two years.<br /><br />As a biographer, William Hague is in many ways a perfect choice for William Pitt the Younger.  Hague has an eloquence that is inviting and informs without bogging down.  He also brings a special insight into some of the more obscure decisions Pitt made because Hague also served in the House of Commons and came to office in his twenties.  Mr. Hague also became leader of the Conservative party (the descendent of the party that rose from Pitt's legacy) at thirty-six and despite losing to Tony Blair, he fully understands the massive demands of front line political leadership.  Mr. Hague continues to serve as a Member of Parliament for Richmond, Yorkshire as well as being active in many other duties and activities.<br /><br />I saw an interview with the author about this book.  He said that he would also like to write biographies of Pitt the Elder and Pitt the Younger's friend, Wilberforce, who had so much to do with abolishing the slave trade.  I want to encourage him to write both.  His excellent writing conveys his passion for this period of history, and his analyses provide helpful and entertaining insights to the way politics worked then and how it works today.one of the most extreme examples of this effect.

His excellent writing conveys his passion for this period of history, and his analyses provide helpful and entertaining insights to the way politics worked then and how it works today.	2005-03-12

Mr. Stein wrote this from his own experience.  He says in the introduction that he had pretty much made a hash of his personal life, was using alcohol and some medicines in unhelpful ways, and eating too much also as a form of self-medication.  Many of us recognize those life situations and behaviors.  Some friends of his mentioned that he might try a couple of different 12-step programs.  Mr. Stein says they helped him change his life.<br /><br />The sayings in this book are based on what he learned and heard in those programs.  He states right up front that they are not all original with him, but they are all things he believes and is glad to share.  This is a book you could rush through in a couple of hours and you would be cheating yourself.  These are not witty aphorisms or principles that are implemented like a recipe.  Each one is a sentence or two that you can take some time to ponder and think about throughout a day.  You might want to take weeks thinking through this book.  Some sayings might not mean anything at first, but they stick in your mind and then a specific situation you experience will provide a flash of insight.<br /><br />Heaven knows we tend to get lost trying to run everything ourselves and holding ourselves responsible for things we have no control over and then not facing up to things we can make choices about.  Mr. Stein's thoughts help illuminate how to be at peace by focusing on what matters, what you can actually do today, and letting a whole bunch of stuff go that really doesn't matter.<br /><br />The book can make a very nice gift for anyone you know who is open to spending time thinking about things.  As I said, the book is very nice to look at and hold.<br /><br />Enjoy.	2005-03-12

Most living today do not know the art of letter writing.  Our lives are all phone calls and emails.  We live in the instant and do not know the pleasures and benefits of taking time to form thoughts and writing in complete and coherent sentences let alone taking the time to construct paragraphs or a complete and persuasive argument.  Another problem is that our communications today are perishable.  There are fewer personal documents left for study and almost no drafts to give us insight into the process of composition.  Sure, presidential libraries contain mountains of paper, but so much of it is from staff, is impersonal bureaucrat speak, and lacks the wit, sparkle, and insight of a practiced and skilled writer such as Theodore Roosevelt.<br /><br />TR published forty books, wrote more than 100,000 letters, and his collected speeches fill twenty volumes.  All this in a too short sixty year life (Oct 1858 - Jan 1919).  I find this productivity staggering, especially when one considers how actively he lived his life.  He traveled, he climbed the Matterhorn, he ranched, went to war, fulfilled many public offices including Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Governor of New York, Vice-President, and President of the United States.<br /><br />We all owe a note of thanks to Louis Auchincloss for editing this volume and providing us with 367 of his letters, every one of them one kind of gem or another.  We get observations of TR the Naturalist, the diplomat, the Rough Rider, Governor, President, Ex-President, and the private man.  Actually, we get more sides of him than those, but those are the biggest and most notable gems.  Four of his greatest and most noted speeches are also included.  They all deserve to be read today and should be read by all students of American History.<br /><br />In my view, the greatest of them is his 1910 speech at the Sorbonne on \\"Citizenship in a Republic\\".  \\"The Strenuous Life\\" is also a wonderful speech to read and contemplate. Both are calls to a responsible and fully lived life of duties and responsibilities to earn the rewards of freedom and wealth.  He has no use for the empty life living off the sweat and blood of others.  Magnificent sentiments that should inspire us today and will actually have the beneficial effect of making all, and I mean all, of our present leaders seem small in comparison let alone the indictment it makes on each one of us.  If you do not want to hear a clear call to action, avoid these speeches.  But you will avoid them to your own loss.<br /><br />This book deserves to be read and read more than once.  It is that wonderful kind of book you can dip into for a short read over and over again.  Each time you will come away feeling energized and inspired to do more and to do better.<br /><br />Hugely recommended.

327926:US	53052943	R3BMZ9NVLSR88T	1931082650	197424635	Theodore Roosevelt: The Rough Riders/An Autobiography (Library of America)	Books	5	57	57	N	N	An American Treasure - both the man and the works	Reading this magnificent volume was a joy on many levels.  First and foremost, Theodore Roosevelt could write.  His prose is always strong, active, and colorful.  In \\"The Rough Riders\\" he handles action better than most novelists.  He picks just the right details about the situation to make it come alive.  Whether it is talking about the sound of the bullets buzzing by and the value of smokeless powder because of the difficulty of spotting those using it against you or the plague of sand crabs picking at the dead the reader feels as if he were there.<br /><br />I also found real pleasure in reading about a time in American history that I did not know that much about.  Theodore Roosevelt was a young boy during the Civil War (and he had family on both sides of the conflict) and died in 1919 just after The Great War (WWI).  \\"An Autobiography\\" was written in 1913 after his failed third party run for the presidency.  It is a magnificent work because it is not a chronology of his life.  Instead he tells the story of his life through some events that allow him to illuminate at length on various aspects of his philosophy of life.  He talks about morals, civil service reform, his views on productivity and the working man versus the big corporations negotiating the end of the Russo-Japanese War and a lot more.  At all times he shows how he has considered all sides of an issue and how he came to his decision.<br /><br />One of the problems in reading history is that a false light is cast backward onto events in the past.  The cataclysm of the two world wars and all the history of the following them have made understanding the time of T. Roosevelt, as they understood it, all but impossible.  However, both of these books are completely uninformed by The Great War, the creation of the Soviet Union or anything later because both books were written prior to those events.  We get a great feel for how that world looked to those who inhabited it, the vividness of the Civil War and how the policies of Lincoln were still well known and were debated as living choices and policies.<br /><br />He also shares with us his views on why he had to be such an active politician and especially as President.  There is no doubt that the world was changing mightily in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  The rise of the huge corporations and the industrialization of huge numbers of peoples as workers in those industries created many issues that had to be worked out.  The old government structures were overwhelmed and TR was one of the leaders who helped fashion policies that he and others considered fair and progressive.  Obviously, from our vantage point, we would have made different choices.  But the present is always in flux and always seem simpler in hindsight than it ever was.<br /><br />Another treat is the way he characterizes the positions of those with whom he disagreed.  He always tries to be charitable and often sounds like a kindly parent dealing with a sincere but wayward and somewhat dull child.  It is also fascinating to read this progressive's views about moral character.  He specifically addresses the evils of sexual licentiousness, abortion, divorce, and much more that has become our norm.  It should give us pause.<br /><br />If you have any doubt about his character or courage, compare this example to anyone today you care to name.  Theodore Roosevelt was an Assistant Secretary to the Navy.  He saw the Spanish-American War coming and resigns his post to help raise a regiment of volunteer cavalry.  He is offered the role of commanding officer, but leaves that to his friend, Leonard Wood, and is happy as Lt. Colonel.  He is well liked by his men, never shirks from the hardships and leads his men in battle from the front.  He wanted to be in the thick of things not for vainglory, but because it was the best place to communicate with and ensure the best use and protection of his men.  Whom do you know like that today?<br /><br />Asa side note it is interesting to read the differences in his orthography from our present day usage.  I don't know if the umlauts in double consonants in words such as reelection (reëlection), cooperation (co&ouml;peration), or reenter (reënter) were peculiar to him or some school, but I actually like it a lot and wish we would bring it back.  It looks better and makes reading all that much simpler.  Maybe typewriters did away with them because they lacked the keys to make them.  However, our computers can make those characters easily.<br /><br />If you are interested in American History, the two books in this volume are treasures you owe it to yourself to read.  Oh that anyone in public life could write like this with the kind of inner strength and courage Theodore Roosevelt had.  We would be the better for it regardless of our policy differences.<br /><br />Also, this edition from the Library of America deserves special praise.  There are many high quality black and white photographs that were used in the original editions that enrich the reading experience a great deal.  As always the LOA has made a high quality book that is a delight to hold and read.

This is especially true of their choice of careers, managing those resources, and preparing for their \\"golden years\\".  I could nominate a few topics I think we could cease teaching in order to have room for the necessary classes to provide people with real life financial management skills that can have a direct impact on the improvement of all aspects of their lives.<br /><br />This book, \\"Personal Finance - Turning Money into Wealth\\" is a fantastic tool for students and ANY interested reader.  I wish everyone would work through this book (or one very much like it).  While it is never too late to develop these skills, the younger a person gets a plan for their economic life in place, the more power it has and the better off they will be long term.<br /><br />I like the way Prof. Keown emphasizes basic principles (he has 15 of them) and planning.  He begins the book by providing the foundation of financial planning, teaching the student how to measure their financial health and using that to inform their plan, understanding the Time Value of Money (a topic so vital that no one should graduate high school without knowing, in my opinion), and the basics of tax planning.<br /><br />The author then provides some great information on managing money by understanding the realities of cash and liquid assets, credit cards (open credit) and the traps it represents, using consumer loans in PLANNED BORROWING (another important topic that is almost unknown to most consumers because of the misuse of open credit), and buying homes and automobiles.<br /><br />I really enjoyed his next discussion on insurance.  He talks about the various kinds of insurance, the kinds of protection they provide at what costs, and especially the situations in which buying insurance makes sense and when it does not.<br /><br />The section on managing investments is good, solid, but BASIC information.  Anyone doing anything beyond a few basic retirement plans will need to study other materials.  This section is the one where I have a tiny quibble with the author.  He differentiates investing and speculation by saying that investing involves putting money in assets that provide returns - stocks, bonds, etc - but that speculating is putting money in things like baseball cards that only have a price based on what others are willing to pay.  I sort of understand what I think he is trying to say.<br /><br />However, all investing is in some sense speculating.  The buyer and seller have different views of the future (speculating about the future) and so they make opposite choices at a certain price.  Either of them would change their view, presumably, at some other price.  Stocks do not have a built in return and many do not pay dividends and too often nowadays their residual value is zero.  Too often people buy stocks simply because they are going up (the greater fool theory) and get badly burned as we saw in the Internet Bubble collapse in early 2000.  In any case, the caution the author advocates is sufficient and sound.  I am just concerned that others use the terms \\"investment\\" and \\"speculation\\" differently than the author and might confuse those trying to enter the fray for the first time.<br /><br />This fine text ends with a discussion of life cycle issues such as retirement planning, estate planning, and how all the pieces studied fit together into the grand plan.<br /><br />The author also provides online helps such as problems, quizzes, and especially many useful spreadsheets that the student can not only use, but study to help them build their own that will be tailored to the student's specific situation.  There is also a workbook with the basics of using a financial calculator and the worksheets called for in the text.<br /><br />This is a superb text on a vital topic.  Strongly Recommended for general readers as well as students in a class on this subject (which EVERY college student should be REQUIRED to take - or pass out of by test).ERY college student should be REQUIRED to take - or pass out of by test).	2005-03-04

Doubleday has worked with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to put together this edition.  It is clean, easy to read, has enough information to help the unfamiliar understand what the Book of Mormon is and what it represents.  It is divided into chapters and verses exactly as the edition published by the Church.  The difference is that there are no footnotes or cross references to other books of scripture.  There is a pronunciation guide at the back as well a short guide to doctrinal subjects that point the interested reader to relevant verses.<br /><br />I understand that this book upsets many people.  It has ever been so.  For millions of us, the Book of Mormon, along with the Bible, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price, is scripture that was brought forth by the gift and power of God through the Prophet Joseph Smith.  People who would never consider defaming the Koran or the Bhagivad Gita will go out of their way to attack the Book of Mormon.  Why they can't leave it alone is a further evidence, to me at least, of its divinity.  But I am perfectly content that others regard this belief as deluded and demonstrably false.  I thank them for their concern and urge them to keep on the path they feel to be true.<br /><br />If you have ever wanted to read the Book of Mormon, but didn't want to meet with any missionaries or a member of the Church, this is a perfect edition for you.  And if you want to write me and ask me about my beliefs, feel free.	2005-03-03

Frankly, when I first read the title I was bewildered and unsure what exactly this book would be about.  I think the term \\"Urban Economics\\" is an unfortunate one, but one that is actually well known and in use.  After all, what is urban is not the economics, which are the same micro and macro principles you learned in college, but the complex environment in which they are applied and the admixture of both that is required to get to the root of the issues involved.  But this is a quibble and does not detract from the real value of this useful book.<br /><br />Real Estate markets in cities (the urban part of the title) are complex environments that involve the land itself, population and density, existing stock of buildings and their nature, regulations and codes, taxation, environmental concerns, the broader economy, industry and business mix, and much more.  This book helps the reader develop intuitions and some algebraic tools about how to think about these issues and to combine them to come to better decisions about private and public investment, policy, and planning.  What calculus there is, is kept in the footnotes for those interested.<br /><br />This book is written for any reader that has had basic courses in micro and macro economics (or at least a general course discussing the basics of both areas) and has a decent command of high school algebra.  It has lots of graphs to help the reader understand the intuitions involved and is written quite clearly.  A general reader who had these prerequisites could work his or her way through the book on their own quite handily.  However, the book is clearly aimed at upper level undergraduate or graduate courses in business, public policy, or urban planning.<br /><br />I do recommend the book for those interested in this specialty.  I do wish they had done a bit more careful job in publishing the maps in the chapter on Firm Site Selection.  The legends are supposed to be shades of black and gray (always a bad choice in black and white - use hashing instead) and some of them have two or more areas that are indistinguishable by shade.

Rather than a glib survey of the popular scene with sharp barbs tossed at the usual suspects, Mona Charen provides us with six powerful essays.  She is a former White House speechwriter, and her gift for fashioning vibrant and passionate prose in the service of a well constructed argument shows in every page of this book.<br /><br />These essays take on liberal articles of faith and leftist bureaucratic groupthink.  Mrs. Charen demonstrates how the culture of non-judgment and soft punishment is connected to the great increase in crime for the past several decades.  She shows how blind the establishment has been to why Giuliani's policies in governing New York actually had an impact.<br /><br />She also illuminates how the race relations industry stifles progress and demagogues the issue of race in our country.  Her discussion of the predictable (and predicted) debilitating influence the creation of \\"entitlements\\" has had on our country.  To the point that one Supreme Court justice actually compared the entitlement of welfare to a medical license or a license to practice law.  It is as if all jobs were sinecures and it was up to the government to allocate them according to their whim.  You will just shake your head when see the foolishness of these policies laid out in this essay.<br /><br />Of course, more than one person predicted that these policies along with other changes in our culture would lead to fewer strong families and the cost this would have on children.  Many bought into the notion that if the adults were happier divorced then the children would be happier.  Those that said this was lunacy were shouted down.  Nowadays, it is clear that government policies have made a powerful contribution to weakening families and harming children.  Again, read what Mrs. Charen says and you will learn how this has been a decades long fiasco.<br /><br />The author also does a fabulous job in demonstrating how the homelessness crisis was a pure creation of the left on the one hand emptying the mental hospitals directly onto the streets and then misrepresenting both the mix of who was actually homeless and how many of them there were.  Under Reagan and the first Bush there were gillions of them.  Under Clinton, none.  Under Bush II we are back to at least a kajillion.  Ho, ho, ho.<br /><br />No one is taking lightly those truly in need and we all should help out local programs at our churches and homeless shelters and the Salvation Army to get food and shelter to all in need.  The point here is the naked politics of the reporting on this issue.<br /><br />The last essay is on the tragic destruction of our public schools over the past several decades.  The growth of the education bureaucracy has taken needed resources away from the classroom.  The establishment cries for more money even when we spend hundreds of billions of dollars and keep increasing the amounts tossed into that sink hole.  Yet what our students actually know shrinks - but they feel really proud of themselves and are experts on popular culture.<br /><br />If you are going to get just one book on important current issues I would recommend that you give this book serious consideration.

A friend of mine introduced me to the Deli more than twenty years ago and it immediately became my standard by which all other Deli's are judged.  It is a very high bar.<br /><br />Over the years, the Deli has done ever more interesting things.  Making its own bread, improving the meats and cheeses as well the best of the world's artisan vinegars and olive oils.  What was once just the Deli has grown into a community of businesses.  You can read all about them and all they offer at [...]<br /><br />This book tells the story of one of the three Zingerman's bottom lines (Great Food, Great Service, Great Finance) and how it relates to the other two.  If you are interested in business and how it works this is a fascinating book because the story it tells is so clear that it is a wonder so many miss it.  The answer has something to do with the fact that this is not a recipe book about how to do this and that with a pinch of something else to succeed.  This is very much a book of principles, beliefs, and how they translate into action.  Ari and Paul declare affirmatively that the experience their companies provide for their employees is the kind of experience their employees will provide the customers.<br /><br />How many businesses are willing to live up to that?  I wish more would.<br /><br />If you have ever been to a Zingerman's company you likely had a great time.  While the food was great, just being there was even better.  If you have gone enough times, you probably experienced a time where something didn't go as well as you had hoped.  Maybe it was a terrible experience.  If you let anyone know you were unhappy, you probably experienced an overwhelming effort to make it a great experience and they let you know, many times, how grateful they were you spoke up.<br /><br />They were serious.  They want you to tell them if your experience was great or less than you had hoped.  They want you so happy that you can't wait to get back to one of their stores or eateries.  Go ahead, take them up on it!<br /><br />And that is the kind of spirit that fills every Zingerman's company.  Their service level is asymmetrical.  That is, no matter how much you give as a customer, the service level makes you feel so appreciated and special that you feel like it is gift.  It works.<br /><br />So, read the book.  Think about it and challenge yourself and your company to do better.<br /><br />Oh, and I also recommend taking the ZingTrain classes.

I am very glad to have this book on my shelf of financial books and have benefited from it more than once.<br /><br />I can recommend it to you strongly by praising it for these reasons:<br /><br />1) It puts practical flesh on the financial model bones you learned in your first course on finance. There are very good discussions of the basic and well-known fundamental theories and models, but the authors also share with us what tends to happen in the real world. And isn't that what each of us need to add to our theoretical thinking?<br /><br />2) Each chapter has effective summarizing Key Concepts and Key Terms with plenty of problems to work through and a list of References and Additional Readings that enable the reader to dive deeper into the topic of the chapter just read.<br /><br />3) The book is helpfully organized into six Parts that provide the framework for the discussion. Parts 1-3 are a review of \\"Financial Markets and Instruments\\", \\"Valuing Financial Assets\\", and \\"Valuing Real Assets\\". This foundation gives the student a good grounding in order to see how these principles are used in the work of managing the capital structure of a corporation. Parts 4-6 discuss the \\"Corporate Financial Structure\\", \\"Incentives, Information and Corporate Control\\", and \\"Risk Management\\". These last three sections are the real meat of the book and where a great deal of its value to the business student lies.<br /><br />4) Each of the Parts has an effective and brief introduction that sets the tone for what is to be studied. Even better, at the end of each the six Parts there are two very helpful summary sections: \\"Practical Insights\\" and \\"Executive Perspective\\".<br /><br />This is a specialized topic.

She has a very enjoyable (if a bit too noisy) radio show and she includes some material from that show in making her points in this book.  So, if you already know you don't like Laura, don't bother with this book.  However, if you don't yet know her and have some questions about where our culture is sliding, this book is a great place to start.<br /><br />Her writing is easy to read and has a good dose of humor along with her analysis and insight.  She takes us through several important topics of the day including:  who the self-appointed cultural elite are and what they are saying about America and anyone who doesn't fawn over their points of view, the out-of-control courts, the anti-religious movement to enforce a secular faith, the connection between the anti-war movement and our overseas enemies, the left domination of education, our schizophrenic approaches to controlling our borders, and the anti-America work of the United Nations.<br /><br />The title does not mean that the left shouldn't speak.  Nor does it mean that entertainers who do speak should face government sanction.  What it does mean is that many of us on the right do enjoy the talents of certain entertainers who, for some reason, think that they actually know something about public policy and are surprised that their fatuous statements provoke a reaction from the public.  They seem to expect that their right of free speech protects them from consequences in the marketplace.  That notion is as wrong as their incoherent views.<br /><br />This would be a great book for young people to get a good handle on what is going on in our culture and entertaining for those of us who have a desire to read quotes from the self-appointed that are so far from the main stream that they are both frightening and ridiculous at the same time.<br /><br />This breezy tour of our off-the-track popular culture tries to inform and entertain more than win at a philosophical discourse and it pulls that off quite well.  She exposes their contempt for us folks in flyover country as too dumb and uneducated to understand the complex issues the self-appointed elites want to decide for us rather than let us participate in the public discourse ourselves and through our elected representatives.<br /><br />Enjoy!philosophical discourse and it pulls that off quite well.

What scholars today call \\"The Problem Plays\\" seem to me to be problems more for us because of our changed sensibilities from those of Elizabethan London rather than problems in the plays themselves.  \\"The Merchant of Venice\\" is called anti-Semitic by eminent scholars such as Harold Bloom.  In our post-Holocaust age and our sensitivity to stereotypes of all sorts, Shylock bothers us in a way not dissimilar to watching the great Al Jolson perform in blackface.  That is, it is clearly the work of a great entertainer, but it jars us, makes us wince, and we are (justly) unable to watch with the same enjoyment as the audience for whom the work was created.<br /><br />Still, this is Shakespeare and Shylock is immortal.  When I read through the play, I place Shylock as \\"the other\\" rather than as a caricature of the Jewish race.  More than that, he is simply a vicious person irrespective of his ethnic ties and origins.  I do like Bloom's insistence that this play was written as a dark comedy and was performed as such for centuries.  The editor of this edition, John Russell Brown also states this.  At some time around the 19th century, Shylock acquired pathos and the play has been performed as a drama ever since.<br /><br />Does it work as a drama?  You will have to answer that for yourself.  However, if you insist on a moral drama you will have a great many moral contradictions to settle that do not matter as much if the play is done more for simple cleverness and laughs.  Can we really take seriously the casket game that Portia's late father left her as the way she must select her spouse?  Does Antonio (the Merchant of Venice) seem a proper embodiment of Christian values?<br /><br />To me, the play does seem awfully light hearted with all of its darkness given to Shylock.  He is a villain with infinitely more substance than Snidely Whiplash, but provides much the same function.  He must be hated; he must be spat upon and jeered by the audience to fill his role.  And he must lose in the end.  Not because others are more virtuous (any serious analysis of the play shows everyone in the play wanting in virtue), but simply because he is the bad guy.<br /><br />Portia is the wonder of the play.  Her glow is so bright that it is obvious she is light to Shylock's darkness.  Her defeat of Shylock is acceptable in a comedy, in a serious drama she seems to have gone too far considering what is really involved.<br /><br />In any case, this play has delighted audiences for centuries and will continue to do so.  It is a great read and this critical edition aids the reader's understanding.  The opening essay is fine and the appendices showing the various sources of the tale are also interesting in helping us see the genius of Shakespeare in what he developed on his own and how he wove the various components into this masterpiece.lose in the end.

The fact is that we have a written Constitution and a process for changing the Constitution to prevent the kind of power grab the courts have made in recent decades.  Yet, because of the abdication of the legislative branch and, to a lesser extent, the executive, the courts today reign and rule.<br /><br />For more than a generation the public has been mis-educated about the facts and meaning of Marbury v. Madison.  It is time to insist on a public discourse on these matters in order to put the role of the courts into a proper perspective.  This may seem like a change, since everyone living has been taught that the courts have the final say in our government.  This was not so prior to the mid-twentieth century and was never the intent of our Founders.<br /><br />Once we see the Justices and judges for what they are and compare that to what they are supposed to be, we can begin removing the powers they should never have had.  We need to expend unceasing energy placing them back into their proper role and requiring them to uphold the oath each of them took to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.<br /><br />The author rightly focuses on current debates, only going back in history to provide context.  If Mr. Levin had included all the abuses of the Judiciary, the book would have had to be presented in multiple volumes.  He discusses the current debate in U.S. Courts about using opinions from FOREIGN courts and policies from NGOs in deciding cases.  This is so absurd that it is hard to take seriously how frightening and dangerous this trend really is.  This book helps every reader understand the reality and threat of this very clearly.<br /><br />Mr. Levin also takes us through the follies and convolutions of judiciary thought on the continuing banishment of God from public discourse through judicial fiat, the manufacturing of privacy rights (only sometimes) to support abortion, the torturing of the 14th amendment in order to support (selective) reverse discrimination, providing rights for non-citizens and terrorists.  He recounts only some of the more egregious social policies legislated by a judiciary that sees itself as more socially advanced than the insufferable populace and their state legislatures.<br /><br />Remember, this is all much less about whether or not this or that policy is correct or not, or needed or not.  It is about the way the policy is being implemented, legislated, imposed by judges.  That was never their intended or rightful role in our government.  Our government is certainly amenable to change.  However, it is change brought about by persuasion of our fellow Citizens and mutually changing the laws.  Not by some small number of beings who deign impose their enlightened and more evolved views on us the benighted.  That is the very tyranny we threw off to claim our freedom.  We need to remember that and reorder our government to its proper balance.<br /><br />I particularly liked Mr. Levin's clear and forceful discussion of the curtailing of our first amendment free speech rights by our legislature (to protect incumbents) with the support of laughable court decisions.  Well, laughable if they weren't so tragic to the health of our public discourse.<br /><br />We do need a broad public discourse on this and continue to demand of our legislatures that they honor their oath to protect and defend the entire constitution.  They should not only reign in their own political use of the judiciary to get what they failed to win at the ballot box, but they should be aggressive in putting the entire judiciary back in its place.<br /><br />Newt Gingrich's \\"Winning the Future\\" has a great discussion of this process as well.<br /><br />If you want to read a more complete treatment of Judicial Review - Judicial Supremacy, I encourage you to read \\"The People Themselves\\" which provides a complete and scholarly, yet very readable, discussion of this vital topic.<br /><br />Please, read this book and talk about it with everyone you know.

His passion for the story he tells is easy to see on every page of this big book.  It moves along and keeps the reader turning pages to see what happens next.  That really is not all that easy to pull off in writing history.<br /><br />\\"Every Man a Speculator\\" is subtitled \\"A History of Wall Street in American Life\\".  Some subtitles are throwaways.  However, this subtitle actually tells you more about the focus of the book than the main title.  This is more about the history of public perception of Wall Street.  Mr. Fraser is especially strong in telling us about novels, plays, magazine series, and eventually about movies and other popular notions about Wall Street.<br /><br />The book does not provide any analysis of how Wall Street works and seems to casually dismiss academic models as simply intellectual opinions rather than providing analysis of their merits or deficiencies.  The book focuses on so many scandals over the centuries and the characters that caused them that the reader would be hard pressed to understand that anything other than bad actors and suckers ever bought or sold anything in the financial markets.  This is, of course, not true.  But since the focus of the book is more about the perception of Wall Street in American life, well, maybe there is more merit in the approach taken here.<br /><br />However, I think the modern reader could benefit from a deeper and more considered approach.  This book can certainly stand as a needed corrective for all the rah-rah boosterism that Wall Street has received for the past couple of decades.  However, six hundred pages of one perp-walk after another can distort reality as well, no matter how much fun scandal and malfeasance-meeting-comeuppance can be.<br /><br />The book also suffers from the occasional lapse in accuracy as well.  For example, on page 309 he recounts the old canard about James Hazen Hyde charging his sumptuous \\"French Ball\\" to the Equitable and letting the shareholders pay for it.  Yet, just last year Pamela Beard's \\"After the Ball\\" (also a HarperCollins book) demonstrated clearly that this charge is false and made up by the men who were trying to wrest control of the Equitable from Hyde.  The author also seems awfully focused on J P Morgan, who was supremely influential, but I am not sure he deserves the opprobrium showered on him here.  Nor does J D Rockefeller deserve as little attention as he received here.<br /><br />Anyway, this was a fun read and offered some colorful anecdotes as well as some insights into the literary influence of Wall Street that I did not know anything about.<br /><br />If your politics lean to the left a bit you will almost certainly enjoy this book even more.  It seems to me that if the adults I knew when I was a child were to read this book, given their devotion to the New Deal and their suspicion of all bankers and investments, that they would have agreed with everything bound between the covers of this book.<br /><br />Four stars because in my rating system I think it would be enjoyed more by those already interested in this topic than a broad general readership.all\\" to the Equitable and letting the shareholders pay for it.

While easy to read and to follow, it actually has a vast number of moral complexities that challenge us to think about our own humanity, our sense of justice and charity, and the ways in which even the best among us are so easily compromised.<br /><br />The title, of course, comes from the Sermon on the Mount.  Matthew 7:2 says:  For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.  While the surface reading of this verse seems to be talking about judging righteousness or evil (and it is that), it goes much deeper.  It is also choosing one thing over another and the necessity of harvesting what those choices unavoidably bring.<br /><br />This play is inhabited by many strange characters that exhibit all sorts of self-contained contradictions.  The Duke of a very decadent Vienna who decrees that extra-marital relations will be punished by death, who is uncomfortable with public adulation, who spends most of the play disguised as a Friar.  He is not called the Duke of Dark Corners for nothing.  Poor Claudio is arrested and sentenced to die because is beloved Juliet is about to give birth to their child.  This while the bawd Pompey is arrested and let off without even being whipped.  Angelo, who is certainly no angel, is put in temporary power by the Duke during his time away from court.  It is Angelo who has Claudio arrested and sentenced.<br /><br />Isabelle, Claudio's sister, is about to take her vows as a nun, but comes to plead for her brother.  Angelo says he will spare Claudio if she will let Angelo take her chastity.  She refuses, but consents to the Friar's plan to ensnare Angelo.  This is says nothing about Lucio and his being on all sides of every situation in the play.<br /><br />While I admire all the Arden editions, this play has a particularly fine opening essay especially when it comes to the character and qualities discussed in the play.  The editor provides us insight to how our modern sensibilities will mislead us and keep us from seeing the Elizabethan issues being worked out during the play.<br /><br />The Appendices offer multiple versions of the source material for this play.  Some of which it is suspected that Shakespeare used or was used by those who created the materials that Shakespeare used.  It is a fascinating subject, especially when one notes the differences between the sources and the shape Shakespeare finally gave the plot.  It is indeed a very different play.<br /><br />I think the editor, J.W. Lever, makes a great point that this should be considered a drama of ideas rather than being included in that cloudy category of \\"Problem Plays\\" that so many scholars use as a catch all for those plays that aren't completely comedies and are certainly not tragedies like Hamlet, Othello, Macbeth, or Lear.<br /><br />Strongly Recommendedmes to the character and qualities discussed in the play.

There is a lot of noise in our society about our troubled young.  And that is well because it is true.  There are also an almost infinite number of suggestions on how to \\"manage\\" these problems: counseling, more counseling, medication, raising daycare standards, yet more counseling and more medication, and on and on it goes.<br /><br />This powerful book asks a somewhat different question.  What if the problem isn't the kids?  What if their reactions are reasonable responses to a toxic environment of outsourced childrearing (to daycare and medication), of absent fathers, of transient relationships in their relationship role models, and in consistently bad advice given them on sex, careers, and marriage?<br /><br />She points out the current themes in popular music are abandonment, hurt from missing parents, rage against parental neglect, and the need for oblivion to escape the pain of loneliness.  It isn't rebelling against mom and pop anymore.  It is more like where are mom and dad and why don't they care about me.  This is sad and painful on all fronts.<br /><br />Mary Eberstadt is clear and honest in her facts and analysis.  She admits there is neither simple panacea nor even a complex solution.  She advocates beginning with a new consensus that it would be better for both children and adults if more American parents were with their kids more of the time.  I know that sounds simplistic, but it is not simple.  Given the financial burdens most families have taken on, it is very hard to make something like this happen.  However, if we decide we believe we need our kids and they need us and that time together is important, we can make adjustments in our lives to make that happen.<br /><br />I hope this book is widely read and widely discussed in thoughtful ways rather than just the normal political yelling at the other side.  The topic affects us all.  We all have an important stake in this and we all shoulder some of the blame.  So, let's get at it.	2005-02-14

Maybe two, at most.  The life story that David Rozelle shares with us is remarkable not in its uniqueness, but in showing us how the qualities of tenacity, work, discipline, courage, and pulling together can make an ordinary life extraordinarily capable of overcoming debilitating setbacks.<br /><br />Captain Rozelle's story reminds us that while we mourn the dead in any war, we should be even more vigilant in supporting the living who have paid the price of disabling injury on our behalf.  We learn how careless and thoughtless we ordinary folks can be in fumbling both our awkward statements of support and encouragement and in our uncomfortable avoidances.  We owe it to these fine young people to learn how to handle ourselves better and to give more of ourselves in their support.<br /><br />The author skillfully shares with us how his life led him to the army and how he ended up where he did.  He helps us understand the physical and political difficulties in working in Kuwait and Iraq.  At the same time he is able to give us a more complete picture of why the Iraqis are grateful to us and why a minority still resist the change the Americans represent.  There have been several fine books written by generals and about the war from a high level viewpoint.  Captain Rozelle takes us down to the troop level and lets us see what a magnificent job our brave soldiers are doing in such tough circumstances.<br /><br />The suddenness of his injury is a reminder to us all how arbitrary life can be and the permanent effects an instant can have.  Captain Rozelle does not pull any punches in telling us about the pain he suffered and the difficulties he went through in recovery.  He does not spare himself in sharing with us his difficulties with his pain medication as well as his doubts and fears for his future.<br /><br />His wife, Kim, wrote one of the chapters and we get to learn about his injury from her point of view.  It is a terrific chapter.  She is very honest in telling us about her reactions to the news and how she interacted with her friends and family who tried to support her.  Again, she is very open and doesn't spare herself in retelling this story.<br /><br />We can all thrill to time when Captain Rozelle got his bearings and decided to not only get on with his life, but to run and ski and try to get back on active duty.  He did all those things and used his own recovery to help other soldiers who had themselves suffered disabling injuries.<br /><br />Oh, and the author had an interaction with both Senator John Kerry and President George W.

The problem with reviewing a book like this on Amazon is that too many people vote against your review if you like the book and they disagree with the author's politics.  Newt Gingrich certainly draws the ire of quite a few people.  Nonetheless, I believe this is a terrific and important book.<br /><br />Newt led the Republican takeover in Congress in 1994 with the famous Contract With America.  This book discusses a new contract.  Newt calls it a 21st Century Contract With America.  It is more fundamental and in many ways more challenging than the original Contract.  There are five points in the new version and they have at their heart a change in our national culture.<br /><br />I am pleased to tell you that for tens of millions of us, these five points hit dead center on what we are concerned about and want to change in our country.  We are comfortable with a war to defeat terrorism that lasts as long as it takes because we believe our enemies must actually be defeated rather than mollified until they decide to come after us or our children again.<br /><br />We believe in God and refuse to accept the notion that these fundamental and sacred beliefs that we hold precious are not fit topics for public discourse.  We also believe the current judiciary is overreaching its rightful role in our government and the doctrine of judicial supremacy is a recent innovation and is incorrect.<br /><br />We rejoice in new citizens joining us as Americans, but reject that tacit acceptance of illegal immigration and woefully inadequate monitoring of those whose Visas have expired.  Nor do we feel comfortable with treating non-Citizens as if they were Citizens with the rights of Citizens.  No, we don't want them to starve or their children suffering.  However, this discussion need not be so binary.  There are things that can be done to increase guest worker programs and keep contact with those who are here on a temporary basis.<br /><br />We also believe that our current low level of education in math and the hard sciences is not only a national tragedy, but is very dangerous and could lead to national disaster.  We need to be creative and dedicated in ensuring the rising generation is the best in the world in these areas.  We have been coasting for more than a generation and it shows.<br /><br />English should be our official language with everyone strongly encouraged to learn it, and that our Founding meant something and continues to hold importance for us today.  There is a reason they wrote a Constitution rather than the living and changing constitutions used in other places around the world.  We need to emphasize patriotic education and what is glorious about  America.<br /><br />Personal Retirement Accounts, Personal Medical Accounts, and Personal Social Security Accounts are all needed and would be important sources of wealth creation and cost control in our society.  With greater wealth our society can do the important things in other areas such as actually studying the environment rather than simply positing solutions on the fly.<br /><br />These are the topics Newt discusses in this book and I encourage everyone to get a hold of it, read it, and think about it.

It is an easy read, makes its points in clear prose, and points the interested reader to lots of other material for further study.  It is not written as a history of America.  Rather, it is a series of short articles that offer clarifications, left out facts, and contrarian interpretation to what is being passed off as American History in schools, the popular media, and common accepted belief.<br /><br />The articles fall into several categories that provide different kinds of help.  The first kind is simple correction of popular misconception.  For example, it is a commonplace that counting the slaves as 3/5 of a person for representation in Congress is an example of racism.  Since African-Americans are obviously whole people they should be counted as a whole person for representation. And today, that is true.  However, as slaves they did not have the franchise to vote, nor would the slavers have the slightest twinge of guilt in not looking out for the personal interests of their slaves.  This is why the abolitionists wanted the slaves to count as zero for representational purposes.  The 3/5ths compromise is actually more in favor of oppressing the slaves than zero representational count would have been.<br /><br />The next kind of article provides richer context that overthrows accepted truisms.  For example, the Dred Scott decision by the Supreme Court is the poster child for top to bottom racism in our society and government.  Prof. Woods points out the battle for representation in Congress involving expansion of Free and Slave States into the Western Territories.  This awful Supreme Court decision overturned a decision by a Southern judge that had emancipated Dred Scott because his owner (awful word, right?) had taken him to a Free State voluntarily.  That was the accepted law of the land at the time, but had political ramifications.  The effect of the Supreme Court decision was that, in effect, there could be no Free States.  There is a lot more on this in the book.<br /><br />Prof. Woods also demonstrates how received wisdom has become outmoded because of more modern perspectives and research.  For example, the Robber Barons are still vilified, but current research refutes that they did damage to society.

A reader might want to know why the name Guggenheim is on a number of important art museums around the world and want to know how they got there.  Another might know about the glory days of the seven brothers when they ruled copper mining and smelting.  Another might know about the flamboyant Peggy Guggenheim and want to get more context for her life.  Then there is Harry Guggenheim and his participation in and support of early aviation (he actually participated in air combat in BOTH world wars), his support of Robert Goddard's early rocketry research, and his friendship with Charles Lindbergh.<br /><br />Personally, I am fascinated by multi-generational family stories.  How was the success that founded the dynasty achieved?  How is the next generation formed to continue that success?  Because business changes, the family will have to adapt.  Can they continue the success?  How do they hold things together or why does it fall apart?  Splits within the family are inevitable simply because people will want to establish their own lives apart from somebody else's path.<br /><br />This book has a huge cast of characters because there were so many people coming in and out of this family.  There is a great deal of divorce, faithlessness in the marriages that do occur, a shocking amount of suicide, and proof that money, fame, hedonistic sex, and intoxicants do not lead to happiness.  This book does tell the story of certain members of the clan more fully.  The story of the seven sons of Meyer Guggenheim (who founded the dynasty a $5,000 dollar investment in a mine in Colorado) is quite fascinating.<br /><br />One of the sons, Ben, went down with the Titanic.  The strongest son and the one who became the head of the family after Meyer was Daniel.  However, another brother became a United States Senator, and all of them made their contributions to the family dynasty.  Even so, the youngest brother, William, did split with the family and that has had repercussions to the present day.<br /><br />Solomon lived the longest of the seven brothers and it is his name on the spiraled Frank Lloyd Wright museum in New York.  The story of how that museum came to be is itself reason to read this book.  What a strange cast of characters brought that loved and derided institution into being.<br /><br />The second generation was ruled by Harry Guggenheim, younger son of Daniel.  He led an amazing life, however unsuccessful in marriage.  He was an early pilot in WWI and created a private foundation that accomplished a great deal to make commercial aviation safe and reliable (if not profitable).  One of his friends was Charles Lindbergh and through Lindbergh's advocacy, he funded Robert Goddard's early work in experimental rocketry.  He raised thoroughbreds and his horse, Dark Star, won the 1953 Kentucky Derby.  Through his third wife he founded Newsday and ended up running that for many years and sold it at a huge gain.  You will find his life very interesting and its pains awfully sad.<br /><br />Of course, the most famous of the Guggenheims nowadays is the art collector and flamboyant socialite, Peggy Guggenheim.  The book recounts her life and struggles.  Her demons were many and it ends up being a sad story.  Even her art collection, her life's triumph, is surrounded with a pathetic air because of the way her obsession with it walled her off from so much else in life.<br /><br />There is so much more that this story has to offer that I will simply urge you to take the time to read about these lives and what happens to people, both ordinary and extraordinary people, when they find themselves in possession of a dream of great wealth.  It seems that too often they end possessed by the money and it ends up doing them as much personal harm as it does anybody any good.<br /><br />Of course, being miserable without money is fairly easy to accomplish as well.  By the fourth and fifth generation most of the family has settled into comfortable lives in the various reaches of the middle class.  Many do not have much personal connection to the Guggenheim story and that is also a very interesting story that this book tells.<br /><br />Fine job, and recommended to everyone interested in business, American social history, and dynastic families as well as those personally interested in the Guggenheims.ttled into comfortable lives in the various reaches of the middle class.

Rockefeller, Sr., this book will give you information that will allow you to reassess your views in light of new and better information. This book helped me understand what Mr. Rockefeller achieved during his long life and what he was after. And it wasn't just money for money's sake.<br /><br />Certainly, there is much about his business practices in building Standard Oil that rankle, but you will be surprised how many of them have become standard business practices in our time (no pun intended). The point that is too often overlooked is that this man helped bring better quality, safer, and less expensive lighting oil to the citizenry than they ever had with whale oil (or from any other source, for that matter). And he drove the price of kerosene down and still made money. We shout for better prices for consumers today, don't we?<br /><br />Mr.Chernow writes vividly on the breakup of Standard Oil and how the advent of the automobile made him richer than ever. The accounts of his building Spelman College, the University of Chicago, the Rockefeller Medical center and more are worth reading. As are the family's connections to some of the largest banks in our country.<br /><br />Reading about John D. Rockefeller, Jr.'s path in life is absorbing and bracing. The tragedy (massacre) at CFI is awful and the way Junior faced that and went to Colorado and spoke with the people face to face is evidence of great character.<br /><br />There is something here for everyone to learn about this important man and a family that has an important role in our country to this day.	2005-01-31

It is comprehensive in scope yet has many strengths to ease comprehension and aid readability.<br /><br />The topics are grouped in six main sections each with several chapters on that topic. Since it is unlikely that you will read this reference / text book left to right as you would a novel this organization helps in finding what you are looking for and focusing on the area(s) of interest.<br /><br />There are many helpful illustrations and a good use of color as well as chapter summaries and all the exercises you could ever hope for.<br /><br />A very excellent feature is the use of application problems that take you step-by-step through building an Excel spreadsheet. This is tremendously useful.<br /><br />The CD comes with PowerPoint presentations, spreadsheet templates for various assignments, excel problems for the student to solve, video clips, and sample student solutions (this is a most helpful feature).<br /><br />I honestly find this topic very interesting and the 11th edition of this book to be a very valuable resource.	2005-01-20

It is not that all their work is supreme, but rather that the body of their work is so transcendent and so core to our culture that one must come to grips with it if one wishes to understand what makes us who we are.  There is no writer more central to the English language than Shakespeare.  So, by definition everything he wrote is worth reading and deserves five stars by my ranking system.<br /><br />That is not to say that every play has in it what we value most in his greatest works.  Certainly, \\"All's Well That Ends Well\\" is not one of his greatest works.  However, that is like noting that 2004 was not a good year for Tiger Woods and he still placed fourth on the money list and is still ranked number two in the world.  Even lesser Shakespeare is ahead of nearly everyone else, especially when one factors in the insight gained by experiencing his entire body of work.<br /><br />What we are after in reviews like this is less about the play than the edition itself.  I am a huge fan of the Arden editions because of the helpful insights their scholarship provides into the plays.  We do not have to wade through unnecessary essays on politically correct interpretations of the plays.  In this edition, we get an introductory essay that deals with issues of text, date, interpretation, and performance.  Since this is one of the least performed of Shakespeare's plays, this is necessarily brief.<br /><br />What is this play about?  The title is a motto of young commoner named Helena.  She is the orphan of a doctor and taken in by the Countess of Rossillion.  Helena is captivated by the Countess's son, Bertram who has no interest in her.  The play is about her unrelenting path to have him as her husband.  It is an interesting play with some glorious lines.  But if you are only going to read a half dozen of Shakespeare's plays, you need not bother with this one.  However, I think you should take time to read all of them.<br /><br />So, this is a fine and recommended edition of one of Shakespeare's lesser plays, but that is still greater than nearly everything else and so should be read by all.d take time to read all of them. <br /> <br />So, this is a fine and recommended edition of one of Shakespeare's lesser plays, but that is still greater than nearly everything else and so should be read by all.	2005-01-17

Every now and again I run across a book that takes me off in a direction I had not even suspected would be worth examining.  Heck, this is a book I could not have even imagined.  It is such a treat to be surprised and delighted.<br /><br />In \\"Dream Catchers\\", Philip Jenkins guides us through the story of how the Native American (Indian?) culture has been variously (mis)interpreted, (mis)used, and (mis)adapted over the centuries.  It is essential to remember that this is NOT a book about the religion or spiritual beliefs of Native Americans.<br /><br />In some ways this seems strange because as I read it I had to keep reorienting myself to this fact.  As I read about how White Culture found new ways to use Native American symbols as a label for issues in its own culture, I wanted to learn more about what the actual beliefs of the various North American Native cultures were.  This is a topic for study in many other books (it would require a whole library of books and a lifetime of study to really grasp them in a meaningful way, I suppose).<br /><br />Mr. Jenkins takes us on a lively tour through time and through changing culture and purpose.  While I cannot do an adequate job of summarizing the book here, and I really want you to enjoy the surprising ride on your own, I can say that there really are three broad periods:  1) Rejection: The Indian as pagan, lost, benighted and in great need of Christianization, 2) Tolerance and Transition: the Period after the Indian Wars and particularly after WWI when Christianity and Western Culture had a great crisis of meaning.  There was a huge turning to Indian culture as if it were a monolithic thing.  White writers wrote supposed guides to this Spiritual \\"system\\" and ended up writing about their own beliefs as much as any insights they had to Native American spiritual systems, and 3) Acceptance: the Sixties and New Age creation of all kinds of spiritual paths that used (and almost always misused) native totems, symbols, and words and incorporated White Culture concerns with matters such as the Environment and Feminism, all the way through to UFOs and Magick (sic).<br /><br />This really is a most interesting book. I was exposed to so much I did not know that I honestly did not suspect that reading this book would be such a satisfying and enlightening experience.  I urge you to take the time to read this book.  You will learn more about American Culture as it exists today from this one book than from a whole shelf full of less competent books.<br /><br />Highly recommended.ols, and words and incorporated White Culture concerns with matters such as the Environment and Feminism, all the way through to UFOs and Magick (sic).

Since the sexual angle of the book was played up and the title of the book \\"I am Charlotte Simmons\\" has a confessional tone to it, I was completely uninterested in reading such a book.  However, I was also bewildered.  Why would Tom Wolfe write, well, a trashy book?<br /><br />He didn't.  As always, Tom Wolfe is a reporter.  He uses fiction to tell us truths he has observed in some aspect of our culture.  In this book he focuses on young men and women at college.  Charlotte Simmons is the hero of the story and the title is an important motto she uses to gird herself for what she faces in life.  You can gauge where you are in the story by the state of meaning that phrase has for her.<br /><br />Charlotte is a brilliant young woman who hails from the tiny town of Sparta, North Carolina.  She heads off to one of our nation's great universities (here the fictional Dupont), and has a series of culture shocks that she, like many, many young men and women before her, is not equipped to handle.  Her roommate, Beverly, is the rich and spoiled daughter of an insurance company CEO, she meets Jo Jo Johansen, a 6 foot 10 inch white forward on the basketball team who feels insecure because of the way white basketball players fit and don't fit with the black players.  Jo Jo wants to do more with his college experience intellectually but knows he is unequipped to really handle it.  She meets Hoyt Thorpe, the big man on campus and one of the St. Raymond's frat boys.  Then there is Adam Gellin who is Jo Jo's tutor and a writer on the school newspaper \\"The Wave\\" and feels insecure and resentment to a profound degree.<br /><br />Beware, in this, as in all Wolfe novels, no one escapes suffering.  However, Charlotte is our hero and it is her suffering and transformation that matter the most.<br /><br />Yes, there are a couple of very frank sex scenes, but, no, they are not erotic and they do not swallow the whole book.  Yes, there are many, many uses of the f-word and other profanity, but not by the narrative voice, not by Charlotte, and really mostly confined to the frat boys, the athletes, and their admiring wannabes.<br /><br />There are many delights in the book.  I am glad that I read it.  However, I feel sad for the young people who live lives that are similar to those depicted in this book.  They seem to be oblivious to all the wonderful aspects of life beyond peer pressure and their hormones.  I saw an interview with the author where he made the point that the reaction to a similarly debauched age, the Regency Period in London, was the Victorian Era.  He allowed that such a reaction might happen in the years ahead.  We can only hope.ow the whole book.

They had previously done the same thing with Hillary Clinton's \\"Living History\\" with strong results.  I think this book is more lively and personal.  This is because Morris was more personally involved with Bill than with Hillary.  It is also obvious that he likes Bill more than he likes Hillary.<br /><br />As with \\"Re-writing History\\", those who are passionate about the Clintons either way will likely be dissatisfied with aspects of this book.  Morris believes in and talks about Bill's strengths and accomplishments.  Morris is very clear on the brilliance of Bill's mind, his overpowering charisma, and his ability to learn from political setbacks.<br /><br />However, Morris begins the book criticizing Bill for not taking enough credit or explaining all of his true accomplishments.  He thinks that Clinton failed to put it all together because, Morris says, that Bill sees everything as a series of individual events, as very personalized stories.  So, Bill doesn't see the big picture and how some things connect to other things.  Morris then goes through all of the accomplishments of the eight years of the Clinton administration.<br /><br />The rest of the book explains various aspects of what makes Bill tick.  For example, on page 69, Morris says, \\" In Bill Clinton's world, no move could be made without someone at the ready to jump in front of him and take the bullet - whether they liked it or not.\\"  When one considers the trail of ruined lives left in the wake of both Clintons, I think this is an apt sentence.<br /><br />Morris discusses Clinton's being AWOL on terror and why, that Clinton was a supreme politician who never wanted to be seen engaging in politics, that his most debilitating scandals grew out of his debt to Hillary for saving him from the Gennifer Flowers scandal, and it was Hillary who did not want to be put on the hot seat for the Travel Office Firings or her commodities trading.  Although, Morris admits he cannot really put his finger on why did not settle with Paula Jones when that scandal first arose.  The first settlement offer asked for no money and no apology.  However, Clinton, fearing Hillary (Morris supposes), there were aspects of that whole thing that he could not admit to without angering Hillary.<br /><br />The book also has a whole chapter dealing with errors in \\"My Life\\" and ends with a discussion of the Clinton Presidency and some thoughts about what it all meant.<br /><br />It is a pretty good book, an easy read, and I think it makes a good contribution in balancing the Clinton propaganda put forth in \\"My Life\\".  Morris took the title of this book from a statement Bill made in an interview about the Lewinsky scandal.  Clinton makes one of his patented non-apologies by explaining that he engaged in the affair \\"because I could\\".  It does say a lot about the character of the man and his sense of entitlement and license.<br /><br />I do think that this book deserves to be widely read because of the candidacy of Hillary for President and 2008 and the Clintons belief in the Co-Presidency.mmodities trading.

Not because I feel it beneath me, but because I simply have limited reading time and focus more on what interests me and will help me answer the questions I find most compelling.  However, a close friend of mine recommended this book to me (thanks Tyler).  I had seen an article on this book and the recommendation made me decide to read it.  While I was reading it George Will wrote a fine column on this book, which I also recommend you read on the Washington Post website.<br /><br />What intrigued me was the idea of a work aimed at a broad audience by an immensely successful author that actually raised seriously the idea that the accepted truisms on global warming deserved closer questioning.  While this is not a great book, it is certainly a fast paced adventure thriller that also spends some time on plane flights, in restaurants, and in other calm moments discussing the facts that do not support what everyone knows about certain environmental and even medical \\"truths\\".  He offers real references and footnotes as well as his own views after the end of the novel and an annotated bibliography.  So, the book has a very serious foundation that is very much based in reality that supports the rollicking story that is told through the novel.<br /><br />I hope that the most serious point the book makes, of which the global warming discussion is only a part, is not drowned out by the attacks on the book by those for whom global warming is so accepted that no contrary point of view can be allowed expression.  Crichton puts his most serious argument in the mouth of a nearly mad professor of the ecology of thought, Prof. Norman Hoffman.<br /><br />Since the whole book is about the education of Peter Evans (and us), it is Hoffman who introduces him to the idea of PLM (the politico-legal-media complex) whose function it is to control the population and provide order be introducing a State of Fear into the populace.  It is done differently now that the Cold War has ended, but it has the same function.  It is an interesting discussion that you don't have to agree with to find valuable.<br /><br />The main point of the book is that it is dangerous to mix advocacy with science and that this is done without qualification in today's media and in our legal decisions and political structure.  It is hard for me to think of how one can look around in today's society and not see that this is a danger that is all too true in our world.  However, I can see from the attacks on this book that there are many who disagree.  That is their right.<br /><br />However, I hope that millions will read this book and realize that it is OK to question what the media is promoting and to become more sophisticated in their use of media and how their political choices are presented to them, whichever portion of the spectrum of beliefs they choose as their own.<br /><br />When this is made into a movie, I hope it is a longer HBO kind of mini-series rather than a two-hour theatrical release.  I don't think that what is most valuable in this book would survive the editor's razor in a Hollywood movie that would focus mostly on the thriller aspects (which are pretty good) and pay minimal attention to the point of the book.<br /><br />So, my advice is to read the book.  Open your mind to the author's discussion.  Read the footnotes and the author's end comments and the bibliography.

One of the problems that great artists present to us is where to begin in getting to know their works.  Their masterworks are often so full of what they have spent a lifetime developing that most of it is lost on those who have not yet put in a significant amount of effort becoming familiar with that artist's style and means of expression.  Yet, if one begins with their apprentice works one may become discouraged because they lack the miracles of the masterworks.  So, where does one begin?<br /><br />Shakespeare offers the reader an additional challenge of an English that is removed in style and idiom from us by 400 years.  It is not an insurmountable challenge.  In fact, it is quite easy to overcome with a bit of time reading it and getting into the flow.  It just seems strange in the beginning, but it really does become easy to read once you spend some time with it.  However, getting over that small hill has kept many from enjoying the glories of Shakespeare.<br /><br />This play, \\"The Comedy of Errors\\", is clearly an early work.  It has many virtues, but despite them it does not offer much of what we really value in Shakespeare.  It is a very fine play and is constructed very well.  It is a wonderful first work to read of Shakespeare because it is short and has a very simple plot.  The new reader does not have to spend much effort contemplating characters or the immense subtlety of language of the great works.  Its charms are direct and what it has to offer is pretty much on the surface of the words.<br /><br />The plot is, like all farces, ridiculous.  It involves twin brothers who are served by twin slaves.  They are separated early in life and when the play opens one set does not know the other exists.  One set (the Antipholus and Dromio from Syracuse) visits Ephesus where the other set (the Antipholus and Dromio of Ephesus) lives.  The play involves people confusing the two sets to the bewilderment of those suffering from the confusion.  It really is quite funny.  Of course, eventually, all is resolved to everyone's delight.<br /><br />This edition, like all of the individual editions Arden offers of these plays, has a wonderful opening essay that offers a great deal of background on the play including a discussion of its performance history, sources, and discussion of the play itself.  The appendices in the back offer excerpts from the sources and some brief information on the Gray's Inn performance of 1594.<br /><br />If you desire to study Shakespeare and are willing to spend time reading many of his plays, \\"The Comedy of Errors\\" is a good work to start with just to ease into the language and get a feel for some of the conventions of Elizabethan theater.  Just don't stop here.  Shakespeare has so much more to offer that you owe it to yourself to continue your exploration of this supreme artist.ually, all is resolved to everyone's delight.

If you desire to study Shakespeare and are willing to spend time reading many of his plays, \\"The Comedy of Errors\\" is a good work to start with just to ease into the language and get a feel for some of the conventions of Elizabethan theater.  Just don't stop here.  Shakespeare has so much more to offer that you owe it to yourself to continue your exploration of this supreme artist.	2004-12-24

Certain events seem more to have a more straight line connection and they are remembered and most else is forgotten or temporarily put aside in our memories until needed to create a new explanation of how we arrived in the present.  I bring this up because it is easy to remember the Tip O'Neill or the Sam Rayburn as significant Speakers of the House and to dismiss Denny Hastert, but I think that would be a real mistake.<br /><br />Certainly, I was one of those who said, \\"Denny Who?\\" when Newt stepped down as Speaker (before he would have lost the vote) and Livingston at the last moment succumbed to scandal.  In this terrific autobiography, Speaker Hastert shares his life with us in a compact narrative that always lets us know what he thought and felt without ever becoming maudlin or vicious.<br /><br />Without recounting his life, the first chapter tells of his boyhood through beginning work as a teacher and coach.  He shows us through his life experiences how he learned about hard work, developed his religious faith, and developed a love for athletics (especially wrestling).  He never claims any special virtues except for his abilities to listen, coach, and help people come together.<br /><br />I found his transition to politics very interesting and why it is really a fatal experience to underestimate Speaker Hastert.  He is very sharp, is able to express his judgments clearly and concisely so you know exactly where he stands without ever sounding mean or vindictive.  He knows how to play the games of politics well, but for him it is not the game, it is working towards the things he believes in that matter most.<br /><br />Frankly, as I learned about his personal political views and what he has been working on in the Illinois State House, as a US Representative, and now as Speaker, I have to say I wish I could vote for him.  The last chapter of the book is a quick review of the current issues of the day.  There is a brief addendum where Mr. Hastert shares his thoughts on the death of Ronald Reagan.<br /><br />This is neither a deeply philosophical tome nor a tell-all book to settle scores.  It is a simple story of a life that is interesting and easy to read.  There will be other histories written that will be more comprehensive.  However, we should not dismiss what is happening in our present.  It is always good to pay attention so that as the present fades into the past we have a better context for what really happened than the more artificial context dreamed up by historians who were never there or who carefully set up the lighting on the set of facts they present to better support their own agenda.<br /><br />Good book, good read, good insight into what is going on in Washington today.is a quick review of the current issues of the day.

It is indeed full of many preposterous situations, which are tied into a converging and almost insane plot.<br /><br />Let me give the broad strokes of the plot.  Duke Osrino is infatuated by Countess Olivia who wants nothing to do with him.  Viola and Sebastian are twins who are separated in a shipwreck that has happened before the play began.  Both are alive, but think the other dead.  Viola sees the Duke and is attracted to him and wants to win him over, but cannot approach him as a woman from her station in life.  So, she dresses as a man, Cesario, and offers her (his) services to the Duke.  He is taken with this young man and uses him as a go between to help him win Olivia's heart.<br /><br />When Cesario (Viola) approaches Countess Olivia, she dismisses the Duke's entreaties, but is taken with Cesario.  She finds reasons to have Cesario return several times without furthering the Duke's intentions.<br /><br />Malvolio, one of the Countess's stewards, is taken with her and flatters himself that she is interested in him despite his lowly station.  Others in the Countess's entourage note this and forge a letter from Countess Olivia that expresses interest and asks him to dress in cross-gartered yellow stockings (which was, apparently, a ridiculous form of dress in the time of the play).  He does and becomes the object of even more ridicule.<br /><br />Viola's twin-brother, Sebastian, comes to town with the sea captain who had saved him, Antonio.  In one of the several duels or near duels in the play, Viola as Cesario is being put upon by one of the play's foolish characters.  Antonio steps in to save Sebastian, but it is really Viola as Cesario.  In the meantime Sebastian has met Countess Olivia who takes him for Cesario.  She is so smitten she makes a direct proposal of marriage to Sebastian (assuming he is Cesario).  He, for some reason unknown to us, is so smitten upon meeting Olivia he accepts and they make an agreement to marry in front of a Priest.<br /><br />Anyway, you get the idea and can assume that all is finally revealed and there is a happy ending for everyone, except poor Malvolio.  And this summary says nothing of the delightful Clown, Sir Toby Belch, Sir Andrew Aguecheek, Fabian, or Maria.<br /><br />This wonderful edition also has a wonderful opening essay (half the book), on the play's origins, textual problems, performance history, and performance issues.  The appendices also include the likely source story for the play and the music for the songs sung in the play.  There are also the usually wonderful textual helps and notes.<br /><br />Fine edition of a wonderful play.reason unknown to us, is so smitten upon meeting Olivia he accepts and they make an agreement to marry in front of a Priest.<br /><br />Anyway, you get the idea and can assume that all is finally revealed and there is a happy ending for everyone, except poor Malvolio.

Somehow, it seemed to me that these kinds of events have been put on for almost a century.  I assumed that the bugs had been worked out and that everyone knew what they were doing, that the funding was well assured, and that there was more or less a well-known road map.  In reality, it turns out, that each of Olympics is pretty much a one of a kind; build it all over again kind of thing.<br /><br />And talk about bureaucracy!  There is the International Olympic Committee, each nations Olympic Committee (in our case the USOC), and the hosting site's committee (for the 2002 Winter Games it was the Salt Lake Olympic Committee (SLOC).  These all work to cooperate, of course, but they all also have competing interests that make for some very difficult negotiations.<br /><br />Add to that the unfortunate scandal that broke out over how the games were awarded to Salt Lake (and other previous hosting sites) and you have a situation few would want to take on.  However, Mitt Romney was at a perfect stage in his life with an ethos of service long held in his family, and was just ignorant enough of what he was taking on to accept the plea for his help.  He also had the management and financial credentials, political skills (and connections), as well as a superb understanding of turning around troubled organizations.<br /><br />For those of us who love to read about business and how various situations are analyzed and managed, this is a superb read.  If you are interested in learning about how an Olympics game is put together, funded, made safe, and ready for sport, this is also a wonderfully done book.  However, don't expect to read about the games themselves here.  Mr. Romney does have a few stories about the athletes that he feels represent the best spirit of the games and I think he has chosen well.<br /><br />There is one chapter on the Mormon Church and the games.  Rumor and speculation has made it much more than it really was and I am glad that Mr. Romney took the space and time to set the record straight.  I was also impressed with all the people, banks, and corporations who stepped up and funded the games to get them done right.  And I was also happy that Mr. Romney and his team performed so brilliantly that they were actually able to return millions of dollars to the Federal Government.<br /><br />A good read for a number of reasons.  Pulling off the 2002 Winter Games was a tremendous feat and deserves to be documented.  I only saw them on TV and even there it was spectacularly done.and the games.

Those two monumental founders have had huge numbers of biographies and studies of all kinds written about them.  This attention is well deserved, but in many ways they have become frozen monuments to the founding.  Not so Gouverneur Morris.  He is almost completely unknown outside those quite steeped in the history of the Revolution.<br /><br />However, once you learn that it is his prose we read in our Constitution, that he played a vital role in financing the Revolution, and that he and his partner Robert Morris (no relation, but also a signer of the Declaration and the Constitution) actually and personally bailed out our country you will be shocked that he is so unknown to you (at least he was to me).  He was at Alexander Hamilton's bedside when he passed, he was present at the French Revolution and helped draft their constitution.  I could go on, but I will let you read the book and discover all he did and his influence in the early founding through the War of 1812.<br /><br />This book is a full, if concise, biography of this man who deserves to be better known.  There is a real advantage to reading about a founder who has as yet escaped becoming a marbleized image in the Pantheon of our collective imagination.  He kept a detailed journal and through it we learn much about his life, his thinking, his strengths, and very human weaknesses.  Of course, all of the founders were real flesh and blood men and women, but most have been assumed into history as much more than human.  It is good to read thoughts and words that are still quite mortal and enjoyably fallible.<br /><br />I think Brookhiser has done a fine job with this book.  I do find the subtitle is a bit much, however.  Calling Gouverneur Morris a rake is more about selling books about an unknown man than telling us something essential about the man.  Yes, he did have affairs with married women who had indifferent or unfaithful husbands and did not marry until late in life.  But we really would not know about these activities without his very honest journal.  And judged by the way people live today (unfortunately), well, he was quite circumspect.<br /><br />You will enjoy this book.  It does have a good index and a helpful bibliography.unfaithful husbands and did not marry until late in life.  But we really would not know about these activities without his very honest journal.

447771:US	53052943	R276MRCEVPE4OS	1903436605	370153288	A Midsummer Night's Dream (Arden Shakespeare: Second Series)	Books	5	20	21	N	N	Magical and funny play in a fine edition	There are many reasons for the popularity of Shakespeare's \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\", not the least among them is the almost unique joining of the humorous misuse of language (by the tradesman actors) and the utter beauty of language and expression (by Puck, Oberon, and Titania).  One usually gets a farce of language or an attempt at the sublime.  Here the music of the two enriches both.<br /><br />How can one put together these four disparate plotlines into such a wonderful whole?  The quartet of lovers and their mixed and varied attentions forms the basis of the plot in the comedy and it is a delightful enough farce.  The squabble of Demitrius and Lysander over Hermia while Helena pines over Demitrius, Oberon and Titania's argument over one of her servants and Oberon's use of Puck to manipulate Titania's affections including Puck's mistaken application of Oberon's potion to Lysander's eyes, the pending marriage of Thesus and Hippolyta, and the wonderfully, magically awful play being put on by the tradesman for the nobles.  Putting all this into a wonderful whole is an achievement that I believe is unmatched.<br /><br />I do want to say that this play has suffered a great deal in our sex obsessed age.  We have foisted on this play an eroticism that it does not claim for itself nor display.  While the \\"adult\\" couples (Thesus & Hippolyta, Oberon & Titania) interact and talk in ways that include that aspect of their lives, the youthful couples always talk and act in ways that are concerned with propriety and modesty.  Bottom is hardly the lust blinded brute depicted in modern productions.  He is much more interested in eating and chatting with his Fairy friends than Titania.  It is Titania who is under the influence of the magic flower who is infatuated with Bottom while he remains quite oblivious to her desires.<br /><br />In any case, this is a fine edition of the work with many helps for the reader.  Almost half the book is filled with introductory essays that provide background on the play and its text.  The play itself is full of notes to help the reader understand idioms and definitions of words that are obscure, unique to Shakespeare, or that have changed meaning since 1596.  There are four Appendices that cover source materials for the play, realigned text that the editors believe were corrupted in the sources we have for the play and the last one is the prologue to the play that Peter Quince butchers to the amusement of the nobles.  The appendix provides us with the prologue with correct punctuation, as Quince should have read it.<br /><br />All the background material is interesting and enriches our understanding of the play.  But it is the play that matters and is so much fun to read.ovide background on the play and its text.

However, he has more than twenty years of experience working with the Clintons on Bill's campaigns President as well as Governor of Arkansas.  And, yes, it is appropriate to read what any political consultant says with a certain level of caution.  However, I think that reading with active skepticism can actually increase the value you get from this book because you will be asking yourself what is real and what is pose.  This internal debate will help you get to the important core of what Mr. Morris is saying.<br /><br />Because Mr. Morris is frank about Hillary Clinton's virtues and flaws the Hillary haters will probably not find the book harsh enough and the Hillary acolytes will become incensed at the criticism of their heroine.  Remember, it is wrestling with every claim and analysis the author makes that will help you get at what the book has to offer.  Senator Hillary Clinton is a real force on the American political scene.  It won't do to simply dismiss her or to think she will move back to the Whitehouse by acclimation.<br /><br />The author provides ample evidence that Hillary is a talented person with a lot offer in our country's political debate.  He also shows that she has certain character traits that make her brittle and some instincts that do not serve her well.  Morris presents his view that the Whitewater scandals and the Lewinsky affair were made much worse by Hillary's immediate and continued tendency to shut down, deny, and stonewall.  You may or may not agree with the author's views, but he offers them from personal experience on the inside of the Clinton operations.  Some of his personal experiences with the Clintons will have you shaking your head.<br /><br />He then presents the concept of HILLARY as a personae, brand, or media creation.  This is the lady that is carefully calibrated to political success.  HILLARY is actually much different than Hillary the real person and Morris helps us see the difference and provides some insight so we can decode the way HILLARY is presented to us and what Hillary is actually after.  Morris makes a lot of comparisons between Senator Clinton's \\"Living History\\" and a more candid presentation of the facts and events.  This provides some very interesting reading that provides some real insight into what makes Hillary tick and how she uses HILLARY to advance her purposes.<br /><br />Morris thinks that Hillary is all but certain to be the Democrat nominee for President in 2008 and that the combination of the end of 8 years of a Republican President and a rather empty field of GOP stars that could actually be nominated and keep the Pro-Life base make a Hillary Presidency a real possibility.  We shall see.<br /><br />The fact that the 2008 campaign is already beginning (watch the festivities at the opening of the Clinton Presidential Library and Museum and take note) makes this book more relevant than ever.the real person and Morris helps us see the difference and provides some insight so we can decode the way HILLARY is presented to us and what Hillary is actually after.

Because it is an academic study it does not take sides, but this does not mean the tone of the book is negative towards the Church and its beliefs.  Nor does the Church get an automatic pass.  The Book of Mormon had a powerful role in the founding and rise of the Church that has varied in emphasis over the past 170+ years until its arrival at the central role it plays today.<br /><br />Present day members might be surprised to learn how little the content of the Book of Mormon was used in the preaching of early missionaries.  They concentrated on Bible scriptures so their arguments would be based on familiar ground.  It was the miraculous way the Book of Mormon came forth that was preached.  Professor Givens notes the change in emphasis on using the Book of Mormon in gospel teaching since 1960.  His discussions of the history of archaeology and the Book of Mormon are fascinating.  I also enjoyed his penetrating discussion of (his neologism) \\"Dialogic Revelation\\" as a major contribution of the Book of Mormon and one the important differences in its role from that of the Bible.<br /><br />This book may have the most to offer to people who are not members of the Church, but are curious about the historical events that led to the publishing of the Book of Mormon and of its role in the life of Joseph Smith and the development of the Mormon church.  Because this is an academic book, it is not out to convert anyone.  It is simply a serious and fair-minded discussion of what happened, what significance those who participated in the event felt and said (pro and con), and analyses of important aspects of the book and the roles it has played since its publication.  Anyone who reads this book will be better informed about this very interesting topic and will have the facts rather than rumors and mistaken notions to rely on.<br /><br />It is only in the past twenty or thirty years that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has become the subject of academic study.  Thousands of books have been written by believers and by people who reject the Church, but relatively few by serious scholars.  Even the so-called New Mormon History is often driven and overwhelmed by its inherent, but unstated attitudes for or against the Church and its beliefs.<br /><br />I found this book to be very useful, informative, and skillfully dispassionate.  As a believer, I did not sense any of the all too common condescending reporting of my beliefs.  And as a person who has lived my life in Michigan where the Church is a small minority, I did not find that the reporting of the arguments against the Book of Mormon or the Church to be tacitly supported or rejected.  They were reported fairly and clearly with the strengths of the various arguments noted as were the subsequent replies to them.<br /><br />Professor Givens writes very well and rewards his readers for the time they spend with his book.

The words all seem familiar and yet when I ask myself what exactly has been said, specifics become elusive.  Let us leave aside awful writers whose opaqueness is all they have to offer. Great writers are often difficult, but for various reasons. Some writers are difficult because their vision is so personal: William Blake for instance.  Reading some authors is difficult because of cultural remove.  To the extent that Shakespeare is difficult he can become readily understandable simply by reading him enough.  The strangeness of the language falls away with familiarity and Shakespeare's endless depths become viewable if still unreachable.<br /><br />Stevens is difficult for several other reasons.  First, he uses language differently.  The images he uses and creates are not the point of his work.  Rather, they are a means of connotation and require some digging and wrestling.  It is the accretion of direct and attached meaning that gives his poetry its full weight. Second, at times there is no direct meaning - it is about the sound and the sense of an image without actually being able to label it.  For example, what exactly is a firecat or a buck clattering over Oklahoma?  You think you know, but once you start asking yourself for a definition you can't find one.  You can make it up, but what is the point?  It is really the sound and sense of meaning that matters here.  Also, he does have a cultural context that we assume is current enough that we share it with him.  Actually, it is a time with certain assumptions and intellectual fads that have passed without a trace.  Not being aware of them can add an unnecessary obscurity.<br /><br />But it is all worth it.  Great writers pay off rich dividends because of the way they expand your sense of the language.  Stevens is powerfully unique and opens a whole new wing in the mansion of beautiful letters.  This is poetry you can explore for a lifetime and still find new ways to appreciate and enjoy.<br /><br />This is a fine edition that brings together all his collected poems, many that were never put in collections, essays, a couple of short plays, some letters, a chronology, and textual notes.

When new, they were very current.  Full of fashionable slang, capturing the rising tide of America's urbanization, female independence, new machines, greater sexual license, and the pressures all this put on an agrarian culture.  Now they capture memories of a time that seems more distant than it is.  All of it seems so innocent and simple.  Yes, the writing is very good if not great and the characters still do live, but their context is a memory.<br /><br />Lewis' writing is certainly effective, memorable, and attractive.  All reasons to keep reading him and enjoying the stories and thinking about what he has to say.  I think what keeps him from being timeless is that it seems to be all about evoking a time and place.  There is certainly nothing wrong in doing that; it is just that as the times change the writing may not survive being transplanted into the new context.  I think it is a testament to the author's power that he is still read and lives in our present, even if his influence continues to diminish.<br /><br />At the end of \\"Main Street\\" when Carol Kennicott says, \\"But I have won in this: I've never excused my failures by sneering at my aspirations, by pretending to have gone beyond them.\\"  I think we admire her.  However, when she continues, \\"I do not admit that Main Street is as beautiful as it should be!  I do not admit that Gopher Prairie is greater or more generous than Europe!  I do not admit that dishwashing is enough to satisfy all women! I may not have fought the good fight, but I have kept the faith.\\" any intended irony is made more strange by the added irony of history and cultural change since these words were written.  It all feels more distant and even unnecessarily argued given where we are now.  Do young people today even wash dishes?  Europe generous?<br /><br />The name Babbitt lives on as a kind of archetype.  When someone is called a Babbitt, everyone of a certain age and older knows exactly what is meant.  When I grew up in the `60s he was revived as an epithet for our parents' generation and yet the baby boomers became more conformist and materialistic than any previous generation.  Maybe that is why we haven't taught George F. Babbitt and his exploits to our children as well as we might have.<br /><br />The perfect sentence for Babbitt is, I think: \\"Nothing gave Babbitt more purification and publicity than his labors for the Sunday School.\\"  Will anything else help you understand his character more fully?<br /><br />The Library of America is a largely magnificent series of very handsomely done editions that are of such quality that they are permanent additions to your library.  I love having them on my shelf.  They are a joy to read, hold, and admire.  In addition to the two novels there is a chronology of Lewis' life that serves as a mini-bio, John Hersey provided the notes on the text.

I think he is right that CEOs are simply responding to competitive pressures and the business environment in which they have to compete.  Right now, that means moving certain classes of jobs to other markets.  I don't mean to say that there aren't incompetent CEOs or businesspeople that are simply bad people.  What I am saying is that for the most part the people running businesses do not have the power to do as they wish.  They have to respond to the business environment in which they find themselves.  Just like a frog, turtle, bird, or trilobite they adapt or die.<br /><br />Job dislocations always cause anxiety.  When the railroads came they created a great many jobs, but when railroads gave way to cars, trucks, and airplanes, most of those jobs ceased to exist.  There was a great deal of pressure on legislators to protect those jobs, and to the extent they did, they actually hurt the American economy.  I don't mind help in transitioning workers, I just think it is counterproductive to try and hold on to the past.  We used to have a tremendous industry in breeding and selling horses.  Where is that today?  This kind of dislocation is inevitable and actually healthy.<br /><br />What is not healthy is not preparing folks with a competitive education.  As Mr. Buchholz points out, feeling good about yourself when you are uncompetitive in mathematics is not helpful.  Nor is having a legal and tax system that raises costs of workers and raises prices to consumers simply to make lawyers rich and provide jobs to bureaucrats who could be more productively employed in the private sector.<br /><br />Governments run a fine line in creating laws in favor of this or that business.  They always run the risk of unintended consequences.  Neutrality is almost always the best policy, but that isn't what their constituents clamor for.  Nowadays there is an environment that makes workers more expensive than they need to be (not just wages and benefits) and then provides tax incentives for companies to take their production overseas.  How are these behaviors smart or healthy for the economy?<br /><br />The author also argues that American businesspeople are too often tone deaf to the needs and demands of foreign markets.  In the past, overseas markets wanted the same products we made for our home consumption, or wanted them with some modification.  Nowadays, overseas markets have demands specific to them and local means of meeting those demands.  If we are to compete, we must take those markets seriously and learn what they want and produce it for them.  Mr. Buchholz uses Hollywood as an example of this, but in business school we studied cases with other examples of this very issue.<br /><br />I recommend this book for everyone.  It is less than 180 pages and is written very clearly.  The arguments are focused and will encourage thought and debate on these important issues.  We do need to take action on these issues before the flow of dislocations becomes a torrent.  However, it is important to keep the perspective that our economy is constantly evolving.  When the job lost is yours, it is 100% and it feels awful, but we need to keep a larger perspective of what is actually happening and make appropriate moves.<br /><br />Mr. Buchholz has done us a real service by providing a sharp focus for discussion; we should take advantage of this by reading this book and talking about these issues in as informed a manner as we can.nts clamor for.

He brings us into his struggles, doubts, and mistakes as well as his successes.  He shows us how hard it really is to find great investments even in a wild bull market.  This is a very different book than \\"Wall Street Meat\\".  It isn't as wry but I think it offers us more substance along with a lot of fun.  However, the fun comes from more sources than just humor.<br /><br />The book weaves three threads into the final fabric.  First, there is the hedge fund narrative.  The author provides us with many fun stories about his difficulties in raising money for their fund, the troubles in finding the right investments, and the natural history of his and his partner's successes and failures with the market and private investments.<br /><br />Among other many things, we learn that the real action at conferences is out in the hall, that it is time to leave when CFOs close the doors to their offices or conference rooms or when the sales executive is the power guy, and the travails of getting an Instinet terminal in your office so you don't have to pay a broker to do the same thing for you.  We get to ride with them in their four-door office as the go to meeting after conference after meeting looking for the right investment.  Usually they find things to laugh at, run from, or that are jaw droppingly dumb.  However, every now and again they find things to buy.  Even then, many of them are dogs.  But the ones that take off end up paying for everything including their cheap office above an arts supply store.<br /><br />Second, we get the author's analysis of what is going on in the market and what he and Fred Kittler are trying to do with Velocity Capital.  Mr. Kessler shares with us his metaphors for what he is after - in particular the waterfall and its moment of great power just before it hits the rocks.  There are some serious history lessons on the development of the steam engine, railroads, and integrated circuits as vehicles for investment.  When would it have been right to get in and to get out?  We come to understand that the investments he is after have not just large markets, but mega markets so there are powerful factors of scale.  He wants profitability to go up as prices fall towards the rocks below.  He wants to see a business plan to leverage that scale.  And he wants some kind of unfair competitive advantage.  If a competitor can simply build what you have and be your equal, he feels you have a recipe for large losses.<br /><br />Third, and this seems to be the part of the book that matters most to the author, everything is pulled together to culminate in a philosophical treatise on the future of the American economy as part of the world economy and what we as a country should be focusing on.  His view is that the industrial age is ending and that the future economy is based on intellectual capital.  He also argues that this kind of benefit can't be measured using our present methods of balance of trade or other economic measures built for the industrial age.  Whether you end up agreeing with him or not, his arguments are interesting and worth considering.<br /><br />A fine book that should be widely read and not just by those interested in finance.

I feel that I owe a great deal to William F. Buckley Jr. for all he has taught me and the pleasure he has provided me over the past several, well, decades.  While I enjoy the political discourse, and have had fun with his novels, for me Mr. Buckley's writing is at its very best when he gets personal.  Read his descriptions of being on watch alone at sea, or his tribute to Whittaker Chambers, or his loving obituaries to his parents and you will know what I mean.<br /><br />I have been moved by his writing about his youthful adventures, his faith, his son Christopher, computers, limousines, sailing, and music.  The other thing is, Mr. Buckley is also very funny.  I mean laugh out loud story telling.  While Christopher Buckley's written humor is different than his father's, it is clear that there is an inherited component.<br /><br />This book, \\"Miles Gone By\\" is an edited collection of previous writings about his life so we get a largely chronological understanding of his life.  This is a beautifully done book and I think its rich feel, the beautiful paper, the interesting pictures that capture important and changing times, and the audio CD with the famous Buckley voice reading us brief selections from the book, all contribute to the importance of this book for those of us who have been wanting WFB to tell us about his life in bound pages.<br /><br />Since all of this has been printed before, why buy the book?  Simply because the editing makes the story more seamless than simply reading articles here, there, and across the pond.  The writing remains fresh and a delight to read at an unhurried pace.  I so much enjoyed taking my time reading the work of this self-proclaimed fast writer.  I enjoy enjoying the act of reading.  While I can race through technical material and that which must be read, when I get to material I want to read, such as this treasure, I want to slow down and enjoy it like a special evening with a friend.<br /><br />Why Mr. Buckley enrages some folks eludes me.  They cannot know his writing first hand.  That he has maintained lifelong friendships with his political combatants speaks volumes about his character (and theirs) and while I do not know Mr. Buckley personally, I suspect that his legendary kindness and supportiveness is absolutely true.<br /><br />What a marvelous treasure that will not only sit on my Buckley shelf with dozens of his other books, it is a life story that will also live in my soul.

As you might surmise from the larger text's title, an important emphasis is gathering and understanding how to use data.  Making sense of data using statistics has to be founded on the notion that the data you have are good and meaningfully representative of the thing you are analyzing.  I like Prof. Sullivan's emphasis on the importance of sound data collection and analysis.<br /><br />The book also has many pedagogical helps and suggestions for keeping students' interest.  It is a very practical book for the classroom and has many helps for the instructor to keep things understandable.  The writing is clear and stays away from complicated language.  There are many illustrations, good use of color to enhance clarity and not just for eye candy.  Not only are there the usual tables, there are pull out tables and formula sheets so the student can use them without having to flip back to the back of the book.  Answers to the odd-numbered questions are provided in the back to aid self-study and there is a useful index.  The text also includes a CD with content and movie clips on \\"Six Steps to Overcoming Math Anxiety\\".  So, you see this really is a text for general students getting a foundation in basic statistics rather than high-flying quants.	2004-10-27

As the subtitle says, this book is intended as a primer - a first exposure to the topic.  It would be suitable for high school students and anyone who wants to develop a basic understanding of the concepts involved in probability.<br /><br />The book uses examples from games of chance (gambling), sports, and everyday life.  The solutions to the problems are provided in the back, so it is a book that can be used for self-study - I consider this a huge plus.<br /><br />Probability is a topic that should be more widely understood in our society.

There is a tremendous amount of information in its 1200 pages, but it is well laid out, amply illustrated, with lots of practical work.  The answers to the odd numbered questions are provided in the back to aid self-study.  There are several appendices that provide important tables and the methods for calculating important statistical formulas.  The index is also quite helpful.<br /><br />I think the book has a good balance of the technical with the practical.  It is easy on the eyes and though statistics necessitates the use of a significant amount of math, it is well explained and never overwhelms the reader.	2004-10-26

This book tells the story of the buildup and the execution of both wars in only 140 pages.  This is no autobiography and General DeLong puts himself in the story only to talk about what he did as the second in command at CentCom.<br /><br />On page 253 of Tommy Franks \\"An American Soldier\\" he says that Delong \\"was a brilliant, complete officer, tempered in combat as a young man flying Marine helicopters during heavy fighting in Vietnam; later he assisted in the chaotic evacuation of Saigon.  Like most of my senior officers, he had commanded warfighting units.  \\"Rifle\\" was a well-earned nickname.\\"  This sounds like high praise to me and the analysis and comment DeLong shares in telling the story of the Iraq and Afgan wars confirms Franks' judgment.<br /><br />General DeLong points out several things that the press got wrong such as Woodward in his \\"Plan of Attack\\" assuming incorrectly about the war plans that were already \\"on the shelf\\".  He also shares little known information such as the enlightening fact that Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz and Ahmad Chalabi were in graduate school together.  He also is very firm that Saddam had WMD.  He also shares some insights into the capture and questioning of the senior Iraqi leadership.<br /><br />My own thinking is that everyone should read this book before election day as a corrective measure to many misconceptions about the Afgan and Iraqi wars and their place in the overall War on Terror.  General DeLong has performed great service to our nation for many decades and has provided us a great tool for understanding more about a very important issue of our time.  I hope a great many of us take advantage of this gift.<br /><br />The book has several appendices including a statement by Gen. Franks, some great maps, the Bush Administration's National Security document, and the National Strategy to Combat WMD. These add another 67 pages to the book.

While a few stand out from the pack, it is harder to find one that is fresh, interesting, and informative.  \\"An Empire of Wealth\\" is all of those things and I strongly recommend it to you.  Instead of being a military, political, or diplomatic history, John Steel Gordon has written an economic biography of our country.  Do not mistake this approach for a dry treatise on economics.  Far from it, this book is full of struggle, wild success, bitter failure, dislocation from wrenching changes in the economy due to the rise of new technologies, and marshalling resources for war.<br /><br />He begins with the resource rich, but hostile wilderness that the early explorers found.  The British made the first permanent settlement at Jamestown in what is now Virginia.  The settlers had come for gold, found mica that they mistook for gold ore, and only 38 of the 105 survived the first winter.  They kept coming from England and they kept struggling until they began to grow and export tobacco. Mr. Gordon then takes us on a fast paced, and amazing journey through the nation's founding, the movement west, our major wars, depressions, and the rise (and fall) of technologies such as steam, the railroads, machine supported agriculture, banking, and international trade.  He ends the book with the horrible events we experienced on September 11, 2001.<br /><br />Not only is this a fun read for anyone interested in American History, it would be a fine addition to the history readings for high school or college students.  I especially like the author's honesty about the good and the bad in our history without making us the bad guys or the source of all pain and suffering on the planet.  The reader comes away with a richer understanding of our history and feels good about our place in the world.<br /><br />The book has a particularly nice bibliography in addition to the chapter notes.  The readings offered in the bibliography would enrich anyone and I also urge you to look at them and read as many as you can.  There is also an index to help you find certain topics.

This really beautiful book contains six interesting articles on aspects of the art shown in this event.  The first is partly biographical on the last years if the artist's life.  I say this because a discussion of the biography must also include some discussion of the art.<br /><br />The second article discusses Degas' role in the art market in his later years.  His current popularity does not give you a proper sense of the complex reactions different portions of the art marketplace and the general population had towards him in his last years.<br /><br />The third article is a fascinating study of the artist's craft and centers on studies and photographs he used to prepare for his finished and larger works.  I remember being very fascinated by the studies while viewing the exhibition.<br /><br />The fourth article discusses his use of pastels and oils in his later years.  Degas was a master colorist and the way he layered his pastels and saturates us with color is still breathtaking.  The fifth article discusses his subject matter and how it changed over his last few years.<br /><br />The sixth article discusses his place in the community of artists and their society in his later years.  This is interesting given his reputation as a recluse.<br /><br />The second half of the book provides full-page plates of the paintings, drawings, sketches, and sculpture in the exhibition.  There is also a chronology of his later years, the lenders to the exhibition and a detailed list of items in the exhibition, notes for the articles, and an index.<br /><br />As fine a book accompanying an exhibition as you will likely find.	2004-10-08

If you think of the definitions as short articles on a topic you will be closer to the mark.  There are also many short biographies of important historical artists.  One of the nice conventions is an asterisk before terms used in the articles that are also themselves the subject of articles.<br /><br />There are no illustrations, plates, or diagrams in the book.

He impressed me so much that I went online and ordered it from Amazon instantly.  It is a great read because McDougall writes clearly, concisely, and with a rare vividness for a scholar.<br /><br />This is not a book of American History per se.  It is a book about American's developing and changing doctrines of how to deal with the world beyond our borders.  McDougall discusses eight doctrines with four under the \\"Old Testament\\" heading (when America was basically turned inward and worried only about the Western Hemisphere), and four under the \\"New Testament\\" (when America became a player on the world stage and, briefly, a colonial power).<br /><br />Understanding these doctrines is essential to understanding America's changing place in the world.  These doctrines conflict with each other and yet the all still echo through history to our present.  This leads to some of the complexity in our present political relationships with the world and our own muddled sense of ourselves and our role in the world.  Certainly, America has done some wonderful things for the world, but the wake of our great ship of state has also made navigation tough for some of the smaller barks trying to stay afloat in the storms of history.<br /><br />This is a fine book and a great read.  I encourage everyone, especially students and young people, to read it carefully and to consider seriously the arguments Prof. McDougall has put forth.  You will be better off whether or not you end up agreeing with him.	2004-10-05

Our political discourse has made trade liberalization synonymous with exploitation and uses the word globalization (whatever it can actually mean) as a pejorative.  Prof. Bhagwati is a world authority on trade and has great gifts in debunking phony arguments against the benefits of trade wherever in the political spectrum they might arise.<br /><br />Prof. Bhagwati has spent decades, beginning in the early days of Indian independence, as an economist trying to improve the lot of the poor all over the world.  He has done the spadework with his own hands and seen directly the implementation of well meaning policies that instead made the poor even poorer.  He has seen how trade liberalization has actually improved the situation in many countries and not just in theory.<br /><br />However, you cannot mistake him for an ivory tower ideologue.  He engages false arguments directly and in person.  He debated the students in turtle suits protesting shrimp farming.  He takes on American politicians who use the mask of aid to poor countries as a Trojan Horse to muscle local laws and regulations that end up making the receiving country worse off and more dependent.  He takes on the NGOs and demonstrates that their using nonsensical arguments weakens their otherwise worthy role as democratic watchdogs.<br /><br />This is a book that should be read by everyone.  You will be better informed on this important issue because almost none of us are as well informed as Prof. Bhagwati and he has done a great job in getting a great deal of it down in only 265 pages (plus notes, and index).  You do not have to agree with him to benefit from this book.  In fact, where you disagree with him, he will force you to sharpen and strengthen your arguments (as great teachers always do).<br /><br />I personally am not as sanguine as Prof. Bhagwati in the role of bureaucrats, and socialist - liberal - progressive solutions in improving the lot of the poor in the world.  However, I do agree with him that the great American ship-of-state, regardless of its intentions, can and does swamp many smaller (and leakier) boats trying to stay afloat in the world economy.  The difference being, that Prof. Bhagwati has actually worked on these issues in the real world, whereas I am simply a citizen who has read and thought on these issues.  So, while I am not yet convinced by his political solutions, I am willing to not reject them out of hand because of the credibility his practical work deserves.<br /><br />We can all do better, and it is the ongoing dialogue and debate that is important.  Prof. Bhagwati does us the service of informing us, making us think, and assisting us in raising the quality of the debate.  I urge you to take advantage of this great book and read it carefully from cover-to-cover.I do agree with him that the great American ship-of-state, regardless of its intentions, can and does swamp many smaller (and leakier) boats trying to stay afloat in the world economy.

It is not that we were only lied to during the Cold War.  That would be a misrepresentation of the reality of those times.  Rather, there were many voices proclaiming different realities to be true.  There were the far right John Birchers, there was the far left Communist Party of America and the organs of the Soviet Union (Tass and Pravda) and everything in between.<br /><br />What is now called the \\"mainstream press\\" was really all there was back in those days (the organs of the extreme organizations were decidedly small circulation underground voices) and these big voices moved more left as the years passed by beginning with the Alger Hiss case.  It was not until the Soviet archives were opened and the Venona documents were declassified that incontrovertible evidence forced the left to admit that Hiss was indeed working for the Soviets.<br /><br />This book begins with the end of World War Two through the Cuban Missle Crisis.  It provides fascinating insight into what the Soviet Archives actually confirm about those decades.  We now know that the Soviets had clear designs on Europe and thought they had Germany in their pocket.  Except for the Marshall Plan, they very well might have succeeded.  We know that it took Stalin's go ahead to start the Korean War, and we know much more about the Soviet thinking leading up to and during the Cuban Missile Crisis.<br /><br />Prof. Gaddis provides a fascinating story and solid reporting and incisive analysis.  I enjoyed this book a great deal.  Some may wonder why it is so important to clarify these past events.  It is simply because so many voices were wrong and many of them were consciously trying to obfuscate the truth or were being used by those supporting the interests of the Soviet Union.  They did so for many different reasons.  Nevertheless, they were working against the interests of the United States (of course, some of them then and today say that their actions are, in fact, working for the interests of the United States because they see their socialist (or progressive) vision as in the interests of the USA).<br /><br />Some may find the facts reported in this great book to be difficult to accept because of the conflict with their ideology.  I do feel sorry for them.  Prof. Gaddis does a solid job in presenting reality in a way that is hard to gainsay.  It is very hard to spin away from the conclusions presented in this important book.rse, some of them then and today say that their actions are, in fact, working for the interests of the United States because they see their socialist (or progressive) vision as in the interests of the USA). <br /> <br />Some may find the facts reported in this great book to be difficult to accept because of the conflict with their ideology.

I was fortunate to be in London on business and took in this amazing display of pottery.  This book is a companion to that show and has several fine articles on the major pieces and the development of Wedgwood as a commercial enterprise and an art form.<br /><br />The book also has the catalogues of the various displays and so provides much helpful information on major Wedgwood pieces for those who follow this kind of thing.  I should also say that the V & A has an outstanding display of Wedgwood available every day.  So, the next time you get to London you should head to the museum and take it in along with all the other wonderful pieces they have in their many halls.<br /><br />The book has many color photos and many more in black and white.  I think it still has value for Wedgwood enthusiasts and the curious as a general book rather than being an obsolete exhibition program.	2004-10-01

In my view, this is a very good text.  In its nearly 700 pages, it provides a solid and comprehensive overview of this interesting and important topic.  Obviously, no textbook can be both a survey of the topic and provide complete coverage of every topic.  This book goes deep enough that students being introduced to this topic will find plenty to work on and get enough information to develop a feel for all that is involved in changing corporate control and ownership structure for any number of reasons.<br /><br />The book has 22 chapters in six parts.  The six parts are:<br /><br />1)Takeovers and Mergers in Practice<br /><br />2)M&As - Theories and Empirical Tests<br /><br />3)Valuation - The Strategic Perspective<br /><br />4)Restructuring<br /><br />5)M&A Strategies<br /><br />6)Strategies for Creating Value<br /><br />There are many end of chapter questions and dozens of mini-cases in the book.  Plus, there are online resources for students available.<br /><br />The book provides references at the end of each chapter for more in depth study, a glossary at the end, and an index.<br /><br />This is a solid text that can also be read by the general reader interested in this topic.	2004-09-30

You know they are big name because on the cover of the book their names are bigger than the title.  That's sort of the definition, right?<br /><br />Seriously, this is a very fine book.  Even though it is a dozen years old and much has happened in the theories of organization, compensation, and incentives, the information in this book remains valuable.  The book has 17 chapters organized in 7 parts.  They are:<br /><br />1)Does Organization Matter<br /><br />2)Coordination: Markets and Management<br /><br />3)Motivation: Contracts, Information, and Incentives<br /><br />4)Efficient Incentives: Contracts and Ownership<br /><br />5)Employment: Contracts, Compensation, and Careers<br /><br />6)Finance: Investments, Capital Structure, and Corporate Control<br /><br />7)The Design and Dynamics of Organization<br /><br />I think that presenting these business topics as topics in economics is very helpful in developing the right habits of thinking.  While the book is not heavy in mathematics, it does present the relevant formulas and does not shy away from serious discussions of economics.  In this way it is a very practical and applied text.<br /><br />While this book has been and should continue to be used in classes, I hope it gets a larger audience in the general readership interested in business and economics.  It really is that interesting and well written.	2004-09-30

While some of its specific examples have aged and its basic message around core competencies and numerator growth rather than denominator reduction have passed into common business parlance, it is still a solid read that has much to offer.  Every businessperson has to decide what his or her company is going to do, how it is going to do it, and what its future course will be.  This is a surprisingly complex task and it is all too easy to make the wrong steps simply because they seem safe, pragmatic, and obvious.<br /><br />Hamel and Prahalad help clarify how to think about what is at the core of your business and how to build on that while changing and shedding everything that distracts from that.  Do not be fooled, however.  Simply because the book reads well, and its thoughts are clearly presented, applying them in the real world is shockingly hard.<br /><br />Some of the specific examples of this or that company doing this or that have aged.  Not all the companies that were up in 1994 have continued their success.  Nor have all their chosen paths led to continued prosperity.  This is to be expected and does not diminish the message.<br /><br />The key is to think hard about what the authors are saying, gather the things that can help you move forward, and then work to avoid complacency and distractions from what your business is about with every bit of energy you can bring to bear to support your chosen strategy.	2004-09-30

This terrific book takes on the broad sweep of American Realism from the Civil War through 1990.  The book is full of wonderful images from so many different styles that the reader can begin to see that what is called realistic or representational has its own symbolic language and is full of its own abstractions and distortions of trying to represent aspects of our four dimensional world on a two dimensional surface.<br /><br />The book is full of paintings of all types and styles within this broad topic.  There are also photographs of related sculpture and even photographs that are themselves the work of art.  The images contained in the book range from the sublime, to the odd and strange, through the raunchy and vulgar.<br /><br />The text is lively, insightful, and adds a great deal to the reader's understanding of the images included.	2004-09-30

This volume, Competitive Advantage, is more complex and offers methods for understanding what a firm is and does and how it creates value.  We all know the term value-chain; it was introduced here.<br /><br />The complexity comes from trying to define firms when no two businesses (firms) are alike.  Then add to that considerations about how do these firms compete with each other, to what degree, and in which ways?<br /><br />The book is 15 chapters grouped in four parts.

I had honestly expected a very political and flawed report.  Instead, this is not only a masterful and authoritative text, it reads like a novel.  It is honestly hard to put down because the pages just keep turning and turning.<br /><br />This is the comprehensive story of how 9/11 came about.  Many myths in the popular press are not true.  Here you can find what actually happened and how the entities involved all relate to each other.  There are many helpful pictures, diagrams, and extensive notes.  Surprisingly, and shockingly, there is NO INDEX!  How could that be?  In many ways that limits the usefulness of this vital text.<br /><br />Every American should read this book because of the importance of the events it describes.  We cannot leave our understanding of this to rumor, paranoia, and myth.  We need to know the facts.  Please, do not take my word for this.  Read it for yourself and decide for yourself.  Do not leave your judgment of this central event of our time to others.<br /><br />I will leave the evaluation of the commission's recommendations to your own views as well.  It appears as if most of them will be implemented in some way, but their call for a very powerful National Intelligence Director will be weakened somewhat.  The future will teach us if what we decide to do is enough.<br /><br />In any case, start reading here and get a great foundation on 9/11 that is based on facts.	2004-09-30

This book provides a high quality sampling of their collection of twentieth-century painting and sculpture.  The reproduced paintings and the photographs of the sculpture are all very good and nicely sized so the detail of the artwork can be appreciated.  Obviously, they will look much better and you will be able to see more when you go to see them in person in Chicago.  However, for those of us who don't have the opportunity to get to the Institute very often, this is a reasonable way to re-capture the experience.<br /><br />Each artwork is given three or four paragraphs that describe the artist and the piece displayed within the artist's body of work.<br /><br />The book is a visual delight that is worth touring through many times.	2004-09-30

Larry Kramer's \\"The People Themselves\\" is one of those delightful treasures.  It provides a concise and intriguing perspective on the circuitous development and varied fortunes of Judicial Review and Judicial Supremacy throughout American history.<br /><br />I grew up in the sixties, when Judicial Supremacy became the default doctrine of Constitutional interpretation.  I attended Marshall Junior High School and even there we were taught that Marbury v. Madison was the proof text since the early days of the Republic.  This wonderful book puts this case in its historical context and shows us how its fortunes waxed and waned depending on the philosophical needs of the day.<br /><br />Prof. Kramer also makes clear the various views of the early constitution and how the aristocratic Federalists actually had no intention of a widespread franchise and how they lost to Jeffersonian Republicanism.  That rise caused its own problems that led to the rise of political parties that, of course, led to a sequence of storms over the centuries.<br /><br />I particularly liked the discussion of the departmental theory and how our various branches have contested for power and even ignored each other in the past.  Prof. Kramer demonstrates how this has waned today and laments the complete submission to Judicial Supremacy while accepting the need for (a more limited) Judicial Review.<br /><br />Of course, I cannot summarize the whole book in these brief comments.  However, please accept these comments as my strongest possible recommendation.  You will benefit from reading this book no matter where you come down on this issue or whether you agree with the author or not.  I wish I could make this required reading for all Americans.  But that is not possible, so I have to urge as many as possible to pick up this terrific and well-written book and read it thoughtfully from cover to cover.fully from cover to cover. <br />	2004-09-29

Of course, our native press is self-absorbed with events within our borders.  Americans are generally uninterested in what goes on outside overseas.  However, we cannot afford that myopic view of things anymore.  The US press also shies away from presenting international stories that might spark international controversy.  It is this gap in reporting that this book aims at filling in.<br /><br />Mr. Gibson has a strong point of view and presents it forcefully.  If you don't share his view you may accuse him of painting with too few colors and too broad a brush.  However, I think we get quite enough equivocation and excuse making trying to pretend that people who do not wish us well are somehow our friends.<br /><br />The fundamental issue is that our relations with other nations are not simply between each nation and the US.  All these nations have their own relations with each other and their own balancing act in how they maximize their own influence in the world.  This is as it should be.  There is nothing wrong with France trying to be the leader in a coalition trying to balance American power.  What is wrong is to be unaware of this goal on their part and to act accordingly.  We should not delude ourselves that these other nations are our unalloyed friends.  Gibson presents news reports, public statements, and other public domain information to illuminate how these nations and their leaders work against us.<br /><br />The one fault I have is that there are no footnotes for the general reader to look up these quotes.  They are generally given enough specificity that the interested reader should be able to find most of them on the web.  And I know that this book is a popular rather than a scholarly work.  However, footnotes would actually strengthen the book and I hope they add them for the paperback edition.	2004-09-22

The choir that disagrees, so the argument goes, will disagree just as passionately with their own set of arguments.<br /><br />I want to take a somewhat different approach to viewing this very useful book.  This book presents its view of both sides on the issue of the role of defense in our government.  Let us first stipulate that both sides are honest in their intentions to defend our nation.  I don't have to believe for one second that Carter, Dukakis, the Clintons, Gore, or Kerry had anything less than a sincere belief that their policies were appropriate and adequate for the defense of America.  I am willing to say that their intentions were honest and sincere.<br /><br />However, let's compare the outcomes of the policies they espoused versus the policies of Reagan, G. H. W. Bush, and G. W. Bush.  This book provides a strong argument with lots of footnoted information to be able to make such a judgment between the two approaches.<br /><br />The appendix provides 74 pages of documents including the speech G. W. Bush gave at the 2002 graduation ceremonies at West Point, the 2002 National Strategy of the United States (the entire document), plus the entire 32 page transcript of Kerry's testimony before the Senate on April 22, 1971.  If you read NOTHING ELSE but the documents in the appendix, I think you can get a strong sense of which way you will want to vote.<br /><br />The text of the book argues strongly against the Democrats and you may be a Democrat who disagrees just as strongly with the Republicans.  That is fine with me.  That is part of the political discussion.  But I think both sides would be better off realizing that it is really a choice of two worldviews rather than a simplistic choice between cowardly democrats or brutish republicans (small letters intended).  No, it is really a choice of one that believes that America does better with a smaller and less threatening military and another view that says that our country faces real dangers and is only able to adequately defend itself with an active, armed, and ever able armed forces.<br /><br />The choice is up to us this November and whomever we elect will say a lot about us as a nation.  I think this book is a vital read before you pull the lever.t is really a choice of one that believes that America does better with a smaller and less threatening military and another view that says that our country faces real dangers and is only able to adequately defend itself with an active, armed, and ever able armed forces. <br /> <br />The choice is up to us this November and whomever we elect will say a lot about us as a nation.

Be the SPONGE!	\\"Be the sponge\\" is what Bill Rancic told himself to be around Donald Trump.  He wanted to use his experience on the show to learn.<br /><br />This book is well timed for the start of the second season of \\"The Apprentice\\".  One of the appealing qualities of Bill Rancic is his recognition that his fame is the result of pop culture rather than anything particularly unique about his life, experience, or wisdom.  However, this book is fun to read (it only takes a couple of hours), and I found the story of his first business in buying junker cars, fixing them up, and selling them to be interesting.  His stories about Elite Boat Wash and Wax were some of the best in the book, particularly his regret now that he didn't think of selling the business at the time.<br /><br />We learned a bit about his cigar business while watching \\"The Apprentice\\", but we get the full story here, and I admire the way they stayed light on their feet and adapted to the circumstances they faced and the opportunities they had the energy to exploit.<br /><br />Each of these biographical chapters is accompanied by a chapter of insights from the author on lessons learned during his career.  These are fairly standard slogans or statements, but he does try to give them a personal twist and I credit him for that.<br /><br />There are about thirty pages on his experience on the show and his analysis of how things worked out in his favor.  Again, he doesn't dismiss some luck being involved, but he doesn't shy away from saying where some of the other contestants faltered.<br /><br />He also talks about his parents and family in a way that adds to the personal character of the book.  The last chapter talks about his goals and plans for the future.<br /><br />I think this book would be a great read for young people wanting to learn a bit about going out and using their energy and talents to establish themselves and learn about what it takes to start small, but profitable, businesses.  Mr. Rancic provides a lot of value for that audience.  It is entertaining for the rest of us, and there are some statements that people of every age should learn.  I loved his statement that when he finally got on the show and was going to be around Donald Trump he kept telling himself \\"Be the sponge, Be the sponge!\\" (page 149).<br /><br />This is book is a fun piece of pop culture, but is more that fluff.

Because of the coverage of the swift boat controversy you might not think that there is any point to reading the book.  That would be a mistake.  The book reads much differently than the news accounts of it.<br /><br />The book has two parts.  The first is about Kerry's fateful four months commanding a swift boat and the incidents that lead to his medals, his fact challenged speeches, and the controversies of his being shot at in Cambodia under orders of President Nixon before Nixon was President.<br /><br />The thing that nags at me the most about the three Purple Hearts in eighteen weeks is how one becomes wounded, recovers, returns to duty, and becomes wounded again in such a short time period.  The reality is that he had no lost duty time for the wounds he received.  I really do wonder about this.<br /><br />The second half of the book is actually incontrovertible because it deals with the very unsavory history of Kerry as a leader in the anti-war movement.  I wish this half of the book got the press coverage because it would cause revulsion from a large part of the electorate.  Because it is so ugly and so well documented the press does not focus on this aspect of Kerry's career.  However, the Senator has wrapped himself in the flag as a kind of War Hero, how can he escape the very activities that made him a national figure?<br /><br />Do we need to go any further in measuring his judgment than his claim that there would be no bloodbath if we left Viet Nam?  The millions who lost their lives in the unprecedented carnage after 1975 testify to how wrong Kerry was.  I am unaware of any acknowledgement by Kerry of these terrible misjudgments, but the press should ask him about them.<br /><br />Kerry's campaign complains of being smeared by the more than 200 veterans who asked him to account for his actions in Viet Nam.  In turn, Kerry's machine smears these men and continues to refuse to make his records available to the public for evaluation.

Nowadays, most introductory textbooks on microeconomics teach intuitions and models that are carefully designed to avoid the use of even basic calculus as much as possible.  This is not necessarily a bad thing because most college students don't have much calculus.  However, for those that have even a basic understanding of calculus, there is a lot to be gained by studying basic microeconomics using mathematical tools.<br /><br />This is the rare introductory text specifically designed to teach using calculus.  This is refreshing and can be quite exciting for advanced high school students, undergraduates, and even masters candidates who would like to use math to be introduced to utility theory, consumer optimization, market demand curves, demand elasticities, short and long run production issues, firm optimization, short and long run costs of production, market structures including monopoly, issues related to input markets, and equilibrium analysis.<br /><br />Really, the use of math here does aid understanding.  The writing is clear, the illustrations are helpful, and the equations are quite understandable even if you only have calc 1 in your repertoire.<br /><br />Take a look, I think you will like it and get real value from it.	2004-08-27

It focuses on regression and hypothesis testing rather than Bayesian methods, so make sure that is the kind of statistics you want to study (most everyone but the most advanced statisticians does).<br /><br />After the intro, Part I gets into Data and Description - the kinds of data available, how to use them and what to look out for.  It also introduces univariate, linear, bivariate statistics, and frequency distributions.<br /><br />Part II provides three chapters on the specification and estimation of regression models.  The chapters discuss theory and application.<br /><br />Part III provides three very valuable chapters on probability distributions (if that is a topic you don't have down pat already).  Part IV consists of three chapters on inference in regression.  This is vital stuff if you want to understand what hypothesis testing is about.<br /><br />Part V is four chapters on various topics in econometrics and Part VI is two chapters on topics in statistics.<br /><br />The book also provides statistical tables, answers to selected problems (always valuable to the reader who wants to verify his or her comprehension of what has been read), a three and a half page bibliography for further reading and an index.<br /><br />I found the book to be interesting, focused, and helpful.  The writing is clear and does not let the complexity of the topic obscure understanding.  However, if you are a general reader who wants to read this, it would be good to have a handle on math through at least calc 1.  The book is not all that complex, however, you cannot just dash through it.  You need to take your time and understand the material as it is presented, work through some of the problems to be sure you understand what has been presented.  Once you have a good grasp on what you have just been presented you can move on.  Just do not dash ahead because you will get lost and then blame the author and that would be unfair to both the reader and the author.<br /><br />Solid text and I am glad to have it on my shelf.  It is exactly what I had hoped it would be.then blame the author and that would be unfair to both the reader and the author. <br /> <br />Solid text and I am glad to have it on my shelf.

The young life of General Tommy Franks is one I recognize even though he is a bit older than me.  He grew up in a family with more values than money, was a rambunctious youth and did not find his true path in life until he joined the U. S. Army.<br /><br />His growing up in Oklahoma and Texas and entering the Army is only the first sixty-two pages of the book. Chapter three is full of his combat experiences in Vietnam.  It is a pretty full chapter.  General Franks definitely knows the face of war from first hand experience.<br /><br />Chapters four and five get his career to general and through the first gulf war.  His observations on what the family of a career soldier has to sacrifice to support the career are all interesting and remind me of what we ask these men and women to do for us.  Yes, many types of careers require families to sacrifice, but military life is somewhat different because of the way it rewards and the specific kinds of sacrifices it asks.  This is interesting stuff.<br /><br />Part III gets General Franks to CINC of the U.S. Central Command.  The rest of the book lets us know about the political complications of being a CINC in that particular region and the balance his job has in being in command, but answerable to the political branch or government, as well as the complications of unifying and coordinating the various branches of the military into a single force capable of fighting together to defeat any enemy.<br /><br />General Franks takes us through September 11th from his perspective and what he had to accomplish, and how they prepared for the war in Afghanistan.  This is where the book gets downright fascinating.  No matter what you think about how the war in Iraq came about and what the Bush Administration had planned or when they planned it, General Franks provides an extremely valuable testimony of how it was planned and when the decisions came to act.<br /><br />The author's discussion of the WMD issue and what he was told be other Muslim leaders in the region (that Sadaam had them and would use them) is important given the strange notions in the popular media and culture about \\"deliberate lies\\".  This book is vital reading for this discussion alone.<br /><br />General Franks takes us through the Iraq War as well and why he and his team decided on moving fast and what actually happened while the media thought that the forces were bogged down during that unfortunate sandstorm a couple of days into battle.<br /><br />The Epilogue is particularly interesting because General Franks shares with us his views on the current and future military, the situation in the Middle East, and our political strife at home.  He makes no claims to omniscience, but is forthright and thoughtful in his analysis.  He is never simplistic or dismissive.<br /><br />I want to say thanks to Malcolm McConnell for putting General Franks' voice in such lively and energetic prose.<br /><br />Great Read and I urge everyone to read it BEFORE the election.told be other Muslim leaders in the region (that Sadaam had them and would use them) is important given the strange notions in the popular media and culture about \\"deliberate lies\\".

That book has thirty-six chapters in thirteen parts. This has eighteen chapters in eight parts.  Parts one and two are common to both editions.  This one excludes the discussion of microeconomics in parts three through seven, but has the rest of the chapters in parts eight through fifteen.<br /><br />It is much more manageable for a one term introductory course in macroeconomics.  However, do not confuse this introductory text with the more mathematically rigorous book Macroeconomics that is also authored by Mankiw.  However, if you want to be an econometrician, neither text is probably enough to get you where you need to be to launch into those studies.<br /><br />This book has a lot of strengths for those who want to develop some intuitions about economic thought and who may not have the mathematics necessary for a more rigorous treatment of the subject.  However, the foundation it will give you will be sound and ecumenical enough to allow you to take on further studies in various branches of macroeconomics that have a more defined theology on the role of government in the economy.	2004-08-22

He did a fine job with Alexander Hamilton which followed this very nice biography of George Washington.  The book justly identifies George Washington as the central Founding Father and goes on to explain how his character was essential to holding the revolution together and the enduring example he set as our first President.<br /><br />The subtitle of the book is \\"rediscovering Washington\\".  I like this approach a great deal because Washington is one of those names that everyone has an image of and thinks they know.  However, when you probe that surface picture you begin to realize how little real knowledge and understanding is there.  This book hits the important points of essential nature of Washington to our founding, his life, his character, and how he relates to our country today.<br /><br />The book is not exhaustive and there is much about Washington to search out after you have read this book.  However, it is short enough for everyone to enjoy and yet offers enough depth of insight to satisfy those with prior knowledge of Washington.<br /><br />Fine job!	2004-08-22

The Rage of the Left, the Truth, and What to Do About It	Books	5	104	134	N	N	Shows the strength of gratitude, education, and faith	What a delightful breath of fresh air this book provides.  This is not an attack book that claims the flag for its point of view while disparaging those who do not agree.  Rather, Stein and DeMuth, in multiple places, praise the patriotism of such pillars of the left as Norman Lear, Bob Kerrey, and Al Franken.  The authors urge a generosity of spirit that I find strengthening because it is borne of confidence.<br /><br />I cannot think of anyone who would not benefit from reading this book.  If you violently disagree with the right in this country, Stein and DeMuth present the least vitriolic case for the conservative worldview you will find in current writing.  It is always good to try and understand those with whom you disagree and this book should help our national discourse find a more reasonable and less strident tone.  If you are a parent you will want to read this book in order to be armed in discussions with your children and their schoolteachers.  If you are a teenager you will want to read this book to get an alternative view to what you hear at school, on the TV, and likely from your friends.<br /><br />The first five chapters discuss the topics that are most in the cultural divide in our country today.  Stein and DeMuth demonstrate the falseness of the left worldview on each of them.  Chapters six through nine compare and contrast the way the left and the right view the world, their approaches to the very real problems we face, and compares what they do with what they say.  Chapters ten through twelve offer what they admit are hypotheses about why the left believes, acts, and sees they way it does.  The last two chapters discuss the fundamental nature of the cultural rift in our country and how confidence, gratitude, education, and persistent activism are the required antidotes to what ails us as a country today.<br /><br />I say thank you and amen to Stein and DeMuth for such a delightful, kind spirited, and enjoyable-to-read field guide to our present culture and the very real crises we face in our education system, our media culture, our political class, and the War on Terror.<br /><br />The appendix also has a reading list of other books, magazines, newspapers, and web sites to use as resources in strengthening your confidence to stand up and be counted.<br /><br />This is a book you should not only read for yourself, but send as a gift to associates, friends and family.

It is a series of chapters that are brief retellings of various historical incidents involving citizens resisting taxation in various ways or citizens being made to suffer through taxation programs.  These tellings do have a point of view and historians may find some of them rather blunt and ignoring certain subtleties that might mitigate some of the author's point of view.  However, in total the book does make its point that it is up to the citizens to hold the government responsible for its spending and the taxation it levies to pay for that spending.<br /><br />While I abhor taxation beyond what is absolutely necessary, I think all the arguments about taxes actually function to distract us from the real thing we should be debating and that is government spending.  The problem is that the modern state has so many of us on the receiving end of this or that program that we will resist any program that decreases the increase in our program's spending (let alone any actual cuts).  So, when someone proposes ANY cut in spending, those being cut raise a loud resistance effort to defeat it.  This is why we try and starve the government by cutting taxes - the hope being that the starved beast will not be able to increase the handouts without limit.<br /><br />Anyway, this can be an entertaining read.  There is a list for further reading and an index.  Just don't take everything in here as gospel.	2004-08-14

Dr. Mankiw focuses on developing intuitions and habits of thought rather than teaching mathematical techniques.  He does this by using ten basic principles that he lays out in the introduction.  Throughout the book, whenever one of the ten principles is discussed he uses a special symbol in the margin to draw attention to that discussion.<br /><br />The book's thirty-six chapters are divided into thirteen parts.  The first two parts introduce the ten principles and the basic ideas of supply, demand, and markets.  Parts 4-7 discuss topics in microeconomics including the areas of current research.  Parts 8-13 discuss topics in macroeconomics and conclude with five debates over macroeconomic policy.<br /><br />Since this is a general textbook the author really does not come down hard in one school of economic thought or another.  Conservatives, like me, might find him a bit more accommodating of the role of government in society than we would think healthy.  However, he is far from being a Keynesian or a New Keynesian.  In fact, his discussion of the Phillips Curve has brought him under attack in some circles.  I feel that his trying to develop an intuition of the tradeoff economies face when trying to pursue employment and price stability is understandable and, on balance, helpful to young students and generalists.  Let them wrestle with the more advanced arguments after they develop their facility with the tools of economics.<br /><br />The book does have a glossary, an index, and inside the back covers there is a list of a couple dozen books for summer reading.<br /><br />This is not a one-volume compendium of economic thought for your bookshelf.  It is a textbook for those who wish to develop a basic understanding of economics through general principles.  If you are looking for a beginning text in econometrics, this is not the one for you.<br /><br />The student workbook that you can buy to supplement this text is quite good and I recommend it as well.

We know that the Federal Reserve exists and they have a Chairman - who for the past long while has been Alan Greenspan, but we don't know much about how it is organized, it's relation with the Federal Government, or how it functions.  We know they have something to do with interest rates and unemployment, but not how they make their decisions or what influences those decisions.<br /><br />Consequently, the press and the public speculate a great deal about the Federal Reserve (sometimes beyond the point of absurdity).  People ascribe all kinds of power to the Fed; even the subtitle of this book calls the Fed the world's most powerful institution.  Well!<br /><br />Governor Meyer writes very well and evokes an atmosphere of reserve at the Fed that seems authentic to me (a complete outsider).  He describes the kinds of discussions that go on within the Fed, it's very formal atmosphere, how the Governor's work with their staffs, and how the Chairman runs things.  This is all tremendously fascinating to me.<br /><br />The author is open about his own political leanings, but demonstrates how non-political the Fed really is and how seriously they take their mission of maintaining price stability while minimizing unemployment.  They wrestle with where the boundaries are, how to best measure the true state of the economy, and how to act without being too blunt or distorting the markets away from neutrality.<br /><br />Governor Meyer is frank in his assessment of Alan Greenspan.  He is mostly favorable, but does pick some nits about Chairman Greenspan's willingness to talk about public policy which is outside the purview of the Fed.  Of course, Governor Meyer was a bit of a lightening rod during his own tenure at the Fed, but that was more because he was willing to be rather open in his views of monetary policy, not public policy.<br /><br />This is a terrific and valuable book and I recommend it to everyone as part of their civics education.  It is readable without any special knowledge of the Federal Reserve or monetary policy.  Of course, the more you are aware of the issues surrounding monetary policy the more lively the book will be for you.<br /><br />There are helpful charts in the appendix and very helpful footnotes and an index.ivics education.

It has more a situation than a plot.  The King has sworn himself and three attendants to three years of fasting, abstinence from women, study, and little sleep.  Immediately a princess arrives with her attendants that cause the men to regret their oaths.  Letters are written, delivered incorrectly, and a huge final scene with disguises, masks, and a wonderfully strange presentation of some of the nine worthies.  All of this provides a structure for a rich play of language that is full of wit and bawdy.<br /><br />This edition has a lengthy introductory essay that helps understand the issues of the text, the historical context, and performance practice issues.  The notes are wonderfully helpful in understanding the text and what choices the editors had to make in presenting it.  After the play is an essay just on the text of the play, appendix 2 has additional lines that this edition leaves out of the play, appendix 3 discusses Moth's name.<br /><br />The issue around Moth is that in Elizabethan times Moth would likely have been pronounced more like Mott than our soft th.  And the word mote and moth were roughly interchangeable.  The name of the insect and the word for a small particle meant roughly the same thing.  It is a nice issue to be aware of and the essay is helpful.<br /><br />Appendix 4 lists words that are rhymed in this play - often a revelation to the way words were pronounced 400 years ago.  Appendix 5 lists the compound words, many of them minted in this play.<br /><br />All in all, this edition is a happy experience of a very fun play.	2004-08-02

There are a great many divergent views on various aspects of what is discussed in this book.  Since the boundaries of this science live in speculation and searching for evidence it isn't surprising that people as well respected as Stephen Hawking change their mind about Black Holes and so forth.  This means that some things that were speculated in this book may have become generally accepted by now, or may have been made obsolete by new observations.<br /><br />In any case, for those of us who want to gain some sense of the broad sweep of what are Universe is, what happened at its beginning and how it might end, this book is a fine read.  The authors are able to present complex ideas clearly enough to make me believe I have some grasp of them (when I likely do not, but the sense of belief is comforting).  The language is never condescending for the general reader and is not so long that the detail becomes overwhelming.<br /><br />It is a fine book and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the broad sweep of the existence of our Universe.	2004-08-02

It is not a book on how to become a VC or how to submit your b-plan in a way to attract VC money.  If you want books on getting investment money, I recommend - The Venture Capital Cycle - by Paul Gompers or for angel money - Angel Investing - by Mark Van Osnabrugge.<br /><br />The book begins with a very short summary of the growth of the VC industry after WWII and then presents the VCs in five groups.  It begins with the \\"Fast Forward\\" or the hot Internet and computer based VCs.  Then come the \\"Beginnings\\" - the group after WWII that built the industry.  A contrast is made with the next two groups, the East Coast versus the West Coast VCs.  Finally, a group is presented in Visions.<br /><br />Each of the VCs is presented with a little drawing in the WSJ style.  I think this book is worthwhile just to get to know some of the big names, where they work - or used to work (there have been some changes since 2000) - and what projects these firms and people did.  It can help in building professional associations let alone dinner conversation.<br /><br />Is it a must read?  I don't think so.  However, if you are interested in the venture capital industry I think this would be a very good way to get some understanding of the terrain the industry has occupied and who some of the movers and shakers are (and were).	2004-08-02

He not only has the ability to explain complex scientific concepts to general readers (like me), but he can also explain the controversies surrounding them in a way that the reader can appreciate what issue caused each alternative to arise and what needs to be resolved between them.  This wonderful book takes on the topic the techniques used by astronomers to measure the age of the Universe.<br /><br />Deciding the age of the Universe is not simple, nor is measuring the motion and distance of stars and galaxies.  It is fascinating to read how the present conclusions were derived and the role wonderful technology, such as the Hubble telescope, played in opening new areas of the sky to our understanding.<br /><br />The book has some black and white pictures that do add to the reading of the book, but there are books with truly amazing images from Hubble that are also available.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to everyone.	2004-08-02

If you don't you probably won't like this book because he writes from himself with passion for his topic and point of view.  While I don't agree with every point he makes, I find him worth reading and enjoyable to read.<br /><br />This book had the misfortune to come out just after the Internet Bubble burst.  He had to go around trying to sell the idea that it didn't matter and that his views would come about anyway.  At the time, no one wanted to listen because they were too worried about their 401ks evaporating.<br /><br />Do his points make much sense in 2004?  I would say that they do in many ways.  However, it is clear from the writing that the author was firmly in the grip of the New Economy hoopla.  So, if you can filter out some of the excesses, there is still quite a bit here worth considering.	2004-08-02

You will also find another shelf explaining to you why things are bad and will only get worse.  Readers of a certain disposition will find the books appropriate to their sense of the future and find confirmation.<br />Deflation is a serious topic, but this is really not a serious book.  The book makes the case that our new economic paradigm is, this time, really different because of the way prices fall because of technological efficiencies.  Mr. Farrell links this kind of price decline with the kind of general deflation that follows and economic contraction and huge missteps of a central bank.  The problem is these are not the same kinds of things and do not have the same kinds of effects.  This incorrect mixture of topics under the same noun adds to confusion and foggy thinking.<br />To the person caught up in any kind of economic dislocation the state of the general economy is irrelevant, they are suffering in a depression.  The problem is this kind of book lumps different kinds of things together to create a sense of alarm and concern.<br />Falling prices are a normal part of the business process as products and industries mature.  They are a good thing for consumers of those goods and services and help efficiencies.  They also spur development of new products and services that have higher prices and margins.  In a general contraction and (real) deflation, everyone suffers because borrowers must repay debts with what amounts to devalued currency.<br />For example, we saw this in the housing market in the United Kingdom in the nineties when the collapse of the currency left people having mortgages on their houses that were higher than the market value of their homes.  People just walked away from their homes.  This kind of misery is not the same thing as accounting people losing their jobs because software now does what they used to do.<br />I like Mr. Farrell's urging of more free trade, and of reforming the retirement programs in this country to a single program attached to the individual rather the employer.what they used to do.  <br />I like Mr. Farrell's urging of more free trade, and of reforming the retirement programs in this country to a single program attached to the individual rather the employer.	2004-07-17

The role of randomness in our everyday lives versus our innate (lack of) capacity to deal with it without careful education is one that we need to talk about more in the popular culture.  However, the problems with this book are several.  Its casual and meandering exposition is supposed to make it more accessible, but it actually makes it harder to come to terms with the topic.<br />Also, Mr. Taleb is a bit difficult to warm to, although there are occasional flashes of wit and humor that help.  For example, he is so proud of his personal achievements that he both disparages them (he is ashamed of his Wharton MBA), and uses them as proof of his superiority of almost everyone (he read a lot at the library).  He also has some strange peccadilloes such as his passionate and disproportionate dislike of George Will because he interviewed Robert Shiller (Taleb?s friend and author of ?Irrational Exuberance?) in a rather feckless manner.<br />In the second half of the book he does explain some interesting phenomena about human psychology and randomness in interesting ways, but he goes completely overboard on certain points.  On page 173 he states that Khaneman and Tversky have exerted the most influence on economic thinking in the past 200 years.  Come on!  Name any major economics department that has become behaviorist in any major way.  (Taleb might find such resistance to acceptance a proof of concept ? but people weighing evidence seriously would find it a chink in Talebs case.<br />I think the reality is that what Taleb points to is important and does exist, but that it is something like a second order effect in the big scheme of things.  It may matter an extreme amount in the narrow world of options trading where Taleb indicates he lives, but for most of us it is a minor issue.

Mr. Kay has an elegant and confident style that inspires belief that his pronouncements are the way things are.  He does not have much use for the Chicago school of economics, nor of the idea that small government and lower taxes can add vibrancy to an economy.  He is a Social Democrat who sees little difference between Mao, Stalin, and the management at Ford Motor Company.<br /><br />This idea is so strange as to seem laughable to me.  Mao and Stalin brutalized entire peoples and mismanaged entire countries.  Ford, an international company, is still a miniscule part of the American economy and any mismanagement it might engage in has much more limited effects.  Employees who dislike working at Ford and consumers who become disenchanted with its products have other places to work and other products to buy.  The citizens of the USSR and China had no such option.<br /><br />Mr. Kay also says, strangely, that European productivity is higher than that in America but really doesn?t explain the way the measurement is made nor the effect the recently higher Euro against the Dollar has played in that measurement.  I am not declaring him wrong, I simply would like to have a more complete demonstration of his claim.<br /><br />A most egregious mistake he makes, like many who dislike capitalism, is to equate greed with self-interest.  He claims that many people do things that are not directly related to acquisition or more money or material goods and claims this to be a proof that people don?t act as capitalism claims.  Adam Smith and other explainers of the capitalist model and any of us who believe it in always talk about rational self-interest NOT naked greed, which is a form of irrationality.  That people want to build concert halls or have parks or shelters for the indigent is not irrational nor against a person?s self-interest.  However, opponents of capitalism need to have greed as the straw man to knock down however silly the claim that it is a foundational principle of capitalism.<br /><br />Does the book explain why some nations are rich but most remain poor as the subtitle promises?  I think that Hernando Desoto?s ?The Mystery of Capital? is much more convincing.  But I have my own beliefs, and while I am a fan of European history and culture, I think that Socialism has cost Europe a great deal.  However, you may believe differently and if you do, you will likely enjoy this book more than I.onents of capitalism need to have greed as the straw man to knock down however silly the claim that it is a foundational principle of capitalism.

However, let me state up front this is NOT a general book about real estate as an investment vehicle in the broad sense.  It is a text that provides the knowledge and techniques to ANALYZE commercial real estate as a financial investment.  So, yes, the book is heavy on financial analysis and the many way markets and techniques that exist for investing in commercial real estate.<br />You won't learn a thing about how to pick or manage properties. Those are topics for other books and courses.  This great book does have a rather specific focus, but it needs that because the topic it does cover is so large and there is a great deal to learn.<br />I find the book to be clearly written with the bare minimum of mathematics to make the content extremely valuable.  Because the authors have a practical focus the reader is not overwhelmed or bogged down in abstruse topics or arcane formulae.  <br />The book has thirty chapters grouped into eight parts.  The eight parts are 1) Into to real estate economics, 2) Urban economics and real estate analysis, 3) Basic financial economic concepts and tools, 4) Real estate valuation and investment analysis at the microlevel, 5) Completing the basic investment analysis picture, 6) Mortgages from an investment perspective, 7) Macrolevel real estate investment, 8) Real estate development and other selected topics.<br />From this list of topics you can understand the nature of this book.  If these are issues you are interested in I think you will find this book really delivers the goods and I am glad to have on my shelf of valued business texts.	2004-07-13

This is a magical book.  It took me a long time to find it, but I am glad that I did.  I was never taught the nearly lost art of drawing geometrical figures with a straight edge and a compass.  We did a tiny bit of paper folding in seventh grade, but I never really understood how to get to the core of the geometry.<br />This brief book makes it all a delightful game with clear notation and a tremendously logical orientation.  It makes it possible for anyone who has a desire to learn this topic to get a solid grounding that will help all their further studies in geometry by providing a foundation in the intuitions of how the geometric proof is actually made.<br />I am so delighted to have found this book and recommend it to you highly.	2004-07-12

Its sixteen chapters are grouped into four parts.  Part I introduces the field of organizational behavior, its goals and functions within an organization along with some challenges and opportunities.<br />Part II contains chapters two through six and focuses on how individuals function within an organization and the considerations managers need to have with values, personality, motivation, emotions, and how individuals make decisions.<br />Part III contains chapters seven through twelve and discusses groups in the organization.  It begins discussion foundations of group behavior, some basics on work teams, communication, leadership &amp; creating trust, power &amp; politics, conflict &amp; negotiation.<br />Part IV discusses the Organization System in chapters thirteen through sixteen.  It begins with the foundations of organizational structure, culture, and then gets into the role of human resource policies and practices.  The book concludes with Organizational Change and Development.<br />There is an epilogue to wrap things up, endnotes, and index and a glossary.<br />The book is clearly written.  I like the way the author presents a variety of views and theories and never becomes dogmatic about a certain approach.  Because it is concise it actually has a chance of being read (the usual 750 page textbook is largely left unread in most courses).  However, to really become proficient in any of the many topics presented here the student will have to do much more study and practical work.  I am confident that any teacher adopting the text for coursework would make the necessity for further study clear to the student.  The endnotes do provide many fine sources for such study, but I would like to have seen some sources organized into a list of readings for study organized by topic.  It would have added a few pages, but would not have overburdened this text.<br />In any case, this is a good introductory read for anyone who wants to a quick tour of the universe of Organizational Behavior.s text.<br />In any case, this is a good introductory read for anyone who wants to a quick tour of the universe of Organizational Behavior.	2004-07-12

Whether you agree with Friedman or not is not the point.  These are ideas you need to actually consider and wrestle with.  If you end up disagreeing with him and can state why, you will be the stronger for it.  It is not enough to rail against them emotionally or call them lies.  They are not lies; they are ideas and arguments that ask for debate.  Personally, I have always been a fan of Friedman and am ever grateful that he stood against the tide of the postwar political movements with these powerful arguments for freedom.<br />People often caricature Friedman to their own discredit.  His arguments here are not simply that government is bad, but that using government is often a poor way to get at a desirable social end.  He certainly does not need me to speak for him, but if you think he is for huge corporations and letting the poor without help to fend for themselves, you misunderstand him and should read this work carefully.  Big corporations, he argues several places in this book, are the result of taxation schemes that encourage the retention and reinvestment of earnings that would otherwise have gone to the shareholders to reinvest as they see fit - in other enterprises, consumption, or charity (as well as in taxes).  This is only one example among many of popular prejudices against Friedman that do him real injustice.<br />The book is only a couple of hundred pages, is not hard to read, but does pay off the most dividends if you take your time reading it and consider what he has to say rather than jumping to conclusions without wrestling with your own thoughts (whether you agree with the author or not).  It was written in 1962, so some of the context of the book will require some understanding on the part of the reader.  It was a very different time than today.  However, the arguments remain solid and strong to the benefit of anyone who will spend time thinking about why they agree or disagree with this Nobel Laureate.<br />Oh, and he uses the word LIBERAL for his philosophy and explains the word in it classic sense rather than in the modern US re-definition of the word.with this Nobel Laureate.  <br />Oh, and he uses the word LIBERAL for his philosophy and explains the word in it classic sense rather than in the modern US re-definition of the word.	2004-07-06

Obviously, it is the mind that is trained rather than the ear, but it is called ear training because the aspect of the mind that is being made more acute is the sense of hearing.  One of the reasons the most successful methods of ear training use singing is because of way singing connects the passive mode of hearing to an active mode of listening and discrimination; of hearing clearly so one can replicate the sounds heard.  The act of notating what one hears is called musical dictation and is a desirable skill in developing musical literacy.<br />This book, &quot;Listen and Sing&quot;, by David Damschroder, is quite good in laying out a program to develop those skills.  It begins at a very basic level with simple melodies to sing alone and with fellow students.  I like the way Prof. Damschroder emphasizes rhythm as well as pitch and provides many different kinds of exercises to simultaneously develop the ability to hear melodies, repeat them, sing them at sight from notation, look at notation and match what you see with what you hear, linking aspects of functional harmony with the melodic structure, and writing down what you hear.<br />The book carefully begins with very basic skills, and logically adds complexity so that the skill development seems natural and without a steep learning curve.  However, the student must actually practice the exercises in each chapter or they will soon find the demands being added too difficult to fake their way through (unless the student has these skills already - and if so - why are they reading this book or taking the course?  Pass out of it already!).<br />I think the accompanying tapes are a good investment and will aid student practice a great deal.  The tapes are a separate purchase and are ISB 0-02-870666-8.  The DVDs are not available.	2004-07-06

It was great then and is even better now that they have tightened it up and slimmed it down a bit.  It reads clearly, is focused, and doesn't pull any punches about the benefits, tradeoffs, and limitations of the various problems and methods involved in this subject.<br />Rather than focusing on decision support systems or marketing information systems, this book is focused on a project based approach.  The authors help you recognize a problem, how to formulate it clearly, present it to decision makers for approval, designing the research to be done, data design and collection methods, they offer sample designs which is very helpful.  They then do a fabulous job on data analysis and conclude by showing you how to present a proper research report.<br />There are several helpful appendices providing statistical values for those calculator based problems, but, really, who doesn't use a spreadsheet or SPSS or some similar package anymore?<br />There is also a glossary, a subject index, and an author index.<br />This is a standard text on the subject, and it is terrific.	2004-06-29

The authors take us on a tour of seven of the best known and most visited sites: Tikal, Palenque, Copan, Seibal, Chich'en Itza, Uxmal, and Iximche'.  The book opens with a most helpful introduction to the archaeology of Mayan culture and the cultural elements that are common to all the city-states / regions that we call Mayan.<br />Look at page 21 at the photo from 1891 that shows us what the Temple of the Inscriptions looked like before excavation and restoration. Obviously, all the trees that are cleared in the picture would have hidden them even more, but the photo could not have been taken with them there.  As you read through the lessons on Mayan architecture, housing, writing, religion, and warfare, the Maya become life and blood people who existed at a time and place that becomes nearer to us through this great book.<br />If you are planning to visit one or more of these sites, then this book is a must read as well as a field guide to take with you on the trip.  The authors take key features and each site and explain them in detail.  What a great experience it would be to stand in front of these monuments, murals, and temples with this most helpful text helping you understand what you are seeing.<br />The book is richly illustrated with many drawings of important inscriptions, buildings, monuments, and architectural details.  There are also many black and white photographs, and a section of wonderful color plates to help us understand the beauty of the natural setting that provides the context for these cultures.<br />After the visits to the cities there are many helpful features that comprise another hundred pages of the book.  First, a concordance of Maya personal names provides the spelling used in this book, alternative and common anglicized versions of that name, and a brief description of who that person was.  There is also a key to pronunciation and orthography that I found to be most helpful.  It is always intimidating to see words without having any idea how they would be said.<br />The notes section is full of very helpful information for those readers who want to dig a little deeper as is the list of references (really, a bibliography).  The Glossary of Gods and Supernaturals is amazingly interesting and helpful and the index is a handy way to get back to certain topics in each section when you are trying to tie the cultural elements together across time and geography.<br />As I said at the beginning, this is a fantastic and wonderful achievement that I am very grateful for and it is a final example of why we miss Linda Schele so much.  The other authors are also fine and will continue to bring us much, but Prof. Schele had a special eye for the aesthetic achievements of the Maya and the ability to help us see things her way and enriched all of us who are fortunate enough to read her words.on and orthography that I found to be most helpful.

There are many books offering instruction in learning to use a spreadsheet.  Some books promise to teach business processes but end up delivering a course on basic spreadsheeting with only a passing nod to the business processes the student was expecting to learn.<br />This fine book actually delivers the goods.  First and foremost, it is a solid text on decision analysis in business management.  It teaches the student on how to model optimization problems and solve them using linear programming.  It covers sensitivity analysis and the simplex method, network modeling, integer linear programming, goal programming and multiple objective optimization, non-linear programming and evolutionary optimization, regression analysis, discriminant analysis, time series forecasting, introduces simulation, queuing theory, project management, and concludes with a chapter devoted to decision analysis.  This final chapter covers both probabilistic and non-probabilistic methods, the expected value of imperfect information, decision trees, analyzing risk in a decision tree, computing conditional probabilities, and finally, utility theory.<br />What is wonderfully useful about this book is that it teaches these important principles of business decision making by turning them into practical tools using Excel spreadsheets.  It not only shows the reader (student) how to build the spreadsheet, it also does the important task of teaching the WHY of the tool, not just the how.<br />It is clearly written, is laid out logically, and comes across as supportive of the student trying to learn this material.<br />Included in this book are 2 CDs.  Included are:  an advanced Solver, a 140 day trial of the Crystal Ball software, which will limit your use of it to the term you first study the material, but won't be of use to you unless you buy the software.  The same goes for the 120-day trial of Microsoft Project.  It is great to be introduced to these tools, but once you have invested time learning them, you will need to make other investments to keep using them.  This is OK with me; I just think you ought to know that up front.<br />I think this is a fine text and could be the foundation of a very useful course.The same goes for the 120-day trial of Microsoft Project.

There are some new assessments, some clearer explanations, and improved diagrams.  There are also some new in class skills development exercies, and the online tool for taking the dozens of assessments in the book is now easier to use.<br /><br />This book has been widely adopted and is now in its sixth edition because it has proven to be a valuable and effective text for people who want to think about what skills go into being an effective manager, how to develop them, and what are the practical means of application.<br /><br />The book is divided into four parts:<br /><br />Part 1 - Personal Skills<br />Part 2 - Interpersonal Skills<br />Part 3 - Group Skills<br />Part 4 - Specific Communication Skills<br /><br />Part 1 starts with developing self-awareness, then discusses managing personal stress, and concludes with approaches to solving problems analytically and creatively.  Part 2 starts with coaching, counseling, and supportive communication, then discusses gaining power and influence, motivating others, and concludes with managing conflict.  Part 3 starts with empowering and delegating, then building effective teams and teamwork, and concludes with leading positive change.  Part 4 is a series of helpful supplements and appendices on making oral and written presentations, conducting interviews, and an extremely useful section on conducting meetings by John Tropman from the University of Michigan.  I had Prof. Tropman for my required class on Organizational Behavior and it was a highlight in my program.<br /><br />He covered some of this material in that class and it makes wonderful sense.  He often says that you can use this material to cover as little as you do now, but in half the time.What I particularly like is that each chapter opens with one or more assessments to help the student / reader think in a personal way about his or her thoughts, beliefs, and skills focusing on the key issues that will be discussed in the chapter.  The approach of the book is always practical and the language uplifting and positive.  I think this book shows the way to being a positive manager who can be successful in any situation without having to resort to negative human interactions to get things done.  It really is a healthy approach to management.<br /><br />Also, with this new edition, Prentice-Hall and the authors are offering an ONLINE version of the 30 plus assessments so that students (and general readers) can instantly receive automated feedback without having to use pencil and paper and then figure out how to score each assessment.  It is all done for you.  And for professors, they will be able to drill down on their class data by student or the overall class.

This book is a wonderful guide to helping me see how my home functions and what to look at in seeing what is going well and what needs to be tended to and what needs to be fixed.  Understanding the vocabulary of home building helps me not feel so completely inadequate when I walk into Lowes, Home Depot, or the local hardware.<br />While this book can serve as a fine introduction to the person who wants to get into the home inspection business, it deserves a wider audience because of the education in provides to homeowners like me.  I need to inspect my own home and understanding how to do that is a real confidence builder in being able to care for my own home (or even an investment property).	2004-06-22

That is a broad span, but the editors, Weiss and Taruskin, have done a fine job and keep things moving in a lively manner.  The energy and vitality of these articles holds the reader's interest and wondering what treasure is coming next.<br />Of course, this is a perfect volume for students in courses on music history and music appreciation, but it is also a very fine book for the general reader who is interested in learning more about the history of Western Art Music (\\"Classical Music\\").<br />What I like about volumes of source readings is the way the writings give a better context and flavor of their time than any later writing.  Yes, the editors have to provide some context for us, and the editors do make choices about what to provide to us and they are almost always in translation, but they make a valuable contribution to one's education about the matters at hand.<br />This is a fine collection that is edited in a skillful way for readability, breadth, and vitality.

It not only provides the original language text and a very solid modern English translation, it has a huge number of helps that enable the modern reader and student to delve deeply into the text.  These helps allow those of us with no real knowledge of Old English to gain some appreciation of how our language has transformed over the centuries.<br />Professor Chickering provides a wonderful guide to reading the Old English version out loud, which is a lot of fun to try.  He also provides important context giving background of the poetic structures from the old times and what we benefit from noticing as we read this exciting tale.<br />He also provides background material on the manuscript and what we know about the origins and culture that gave rise to Beowulf.  There is also a wonderful commentary on many key concepts in the story that enrich the reading of the story.<br />There is also a bibliography for further reading and a listing of glosses on selected passages.<br />Yes, the Seamus Heaney translation is beautiful and readable, but this one is much more useful for the student who wants to dig more deeply into the story and how it fits into our cultural heritage.	2004-06-16

Of course textbooks tend to be written with specific courses in mind and select the material they present for a one or two term course on that topic.<br />This book has a somewhat unique combination because it covers rather comprehensively the institutions that make up our financial markets, what they do for a living, the instruments they trade, and how those instruments are structured, valued, and regulated.  The book also provides an introduction to international markets.<br />Since Fabozzi and Modigliani cover such a broad ground they cannot provide the same depth as books that are more specialized in nature.  However, this book is written very well.  It is thoughtful in what it presents and clearly teaches the material it covers in a concise way without merely skimming over the topics.  It is a terrific textbook and can make a good desk reference for any finance professional.  I like it a lot and think it succeeds in its aims quite well.	2004-06-14

Octavian, the youngest of the triumvirate with Lepidus and Antony, proves out why he is Caesar with a cold efficiency that makes all tyrants proud.  Antony, Herculean character though he claims to be, plays the fool for Cleopatra, and Cleopatra plays the role of Cleopatra with smoke and mirrors.  Her famous suicide is actually her triumph and apotheosis of the character she created.<br />Poor Pompey refused to seize the reins of power through dishonorable murder, and yet receives the same from those he spared.  And how many of the attendants to the principles themselves die in this play?  We have poisonings, beatings, and death from shame.<br />This edition is quite fine as we expect from Arden.  The notes are extremely helpful to understand the locations and context of this play with its wide-ranging locales and dozens of scenes that fly from place to place.  Of course, the notes that help with the language and text emendations are wonderfully done.  The longer notes are put in the back.<br />The first quarter of the book is an extended essay on various aspects of this play that ranges from its origin, performance issues and how they were handled over the centuries, and problems of the text.  It is a wonderfully useful essay that added a lot to my enjoyment of reading the play.<br />This is part of the third Arden series of the Shakespeare plays and is very readable and I enjoyed it a great deal.	2004-06-07

The characters are well fleshed out and believable in their actions.  I look forward to new stories from Ms. Scottoline and am eagerly looking for past books by this same author to read and enjoy!  I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes and mystery and enjoys some humor.  There are too many dark and depressing thrillers available and this book is a refreshing change!<br />--- Valerie	2004-06-05

What is sad about this is that good ideas tend to be seen in the same color of paint as the less than good ideas if they can be seen and heard at all.<br />This book is one of the very good ideas that should be seen, heard, and implemented.  The main insight is that companies can compete more effectively by paying attention to how customers experience doing business with them.  Too often companies measure what customers think about their company and its products.  Mr. Carbone makes an effective case that what really matters is how the totality of the experience makes the customers feel of themselves.  This is a big difference and a key insight.  Companies that provide experiences that make customers feel good about themselves are going to have happy and repeat customers.<br />This book provides how companies can gather, measure, and use the clues customers provide through their interactions with the purchasing experience.  The author discusses the methods necessary for implementing the steps necessary to take advantage of what was learned in the marketplace.<br />Mr. Carbone is wise enough to know that getting \\"Clued In\\" is not easy, nor is it a panacea.  It is, however, an important tool for competing effectively.  He also points out that what is a surprise and delight today may become the standard of delivery tomorrow and new clues must be gathered and implemented to gain a competitive advantage.<br />This isn't a long book, but it does offer substance for thought and action.  I recommend it.	2004-06-03

The fourth edition was the single most influential text in my study for my MBA.  It opened new kinds of thinking for me and helped me understand the intuitions and they methods for valuing the various kinds of derivatives.  While the language is not simple, it is not arcane.  Some complain that the mathematics are not rigorous.  So what?  There are such books on the market and are suitable for those that want them.  This is the standard book for thousands of MBAs who need a solid foundation, but do not need to be able to higher math to understand how a binomial tree works or to even create one my hand.  Certainly, it is helpful to understand the math as deeply as you can.  However, the reality is that most of the time practitioners use pre-made tools to run their Monte Carlo simulations rather than programming from scratch.<br />There are several new chapters on very helpful and interesting topics (using futures for hedging, numerical procedures, swaps, credit risk, real options, insurance, derivative crises, and more).  Some of this is new and some adapted from previous editions.  Other material has been rewritten and clarified.<br />DerivaGem 1.5 is included with the book, but a URL is provided to get the latest version from Prof. Hull's website.<br />This is a terrific book and I consider it one of the most valuable on my shelf of business texts.  It is one I would never want to be without and one of the few I am willing to keep up with the new editions.  While no book is perfect for every use in every situation, this is one of the great foundation texts.	2004-05-24

We used it in a course I took on trading while I was studying for my MBA (in preview course-pack form) and it was one of those experiences that provide a new understanding of things and provide new modes of thinking and understanding.  Those are the kinds of experiences are the reasons you go and pay all that money to earn those degrees.<br />This is not a book about investing, securities, valuation, or the laws around trading.  It is a book about traders, what they do, how they do it, where they trade, and even why they trade.  It is the most lucid book I have read on that elusive topic of liquidity and its implications in trading and price discovery.  It is wonderful in describing the different types of exchanges and how they function.<br />I found the discussions on the different types of traders, their practices, and the strategies they use to be fascinating.  There is a reason the book is subtitles \\"Market Microstructure for Practitioners\\" - the thinking of a trader is very different than the buy-and-hold investor.  For a trader, long-term can be a few minutes and inventory has powerful implications as does whether the trading is done via and exchange floor or some automated trading system.<br />Mr. Harris is to be congratulated and thanked for this terrific book.	2004-05-24

While this is designed to be the text of a course teaching the aspects of personal finance from the Time Value of Money to Choosing a Career through rational thinking about consumer purchase and retirement.  It is organized very well with very clear writing and many helpful illustrations, tables, and resources.<br />The book guides the student to many online resources in order to develop skills that will be needed to research the nearly infinite variety of decisions and choices we all need to make in life.  Being informed about the problem we face will provide us a basis for making better decisions.<br />One of the methods the book uses to illustrate the effects of financial decisions on real human life is the fictional Steele family.  The family faces various issues, makes imperfect decisions, and the student gets to ponder what should have been done and what they could do to improve their current situation.  It is a nice device that adds a practical side to the lessons on topics such as mortgages, saving for children's education, and insurance.<br />While this is most likely to be used in college courses, I wish it could be taught to young people as soon as they are somewhat serious about the decisions they will be making to form their lives.  Ideally, high schools could offer an elective class for those serious students who want to get a head start in mastering the financial issues that will have such a powerful effect on their future security.<br />This is really a terrific book and can be read by individuals without a course or instructor.  Obviously, an instructor will help and aid the student's understanding, but this is such an important topic that I encourage everyone who is interested in understanding the financial side of their life to read and work through this book.	2004-05-24

Mr. Sandor is himself a virtuoso and has helped many gifted pianists develop virtuoso technique over the years.  The writing in the book is simple and clear.  The book is organized quite logically.<br />The book is in three parts.  The first discusses the facts of the piano mechanism and what can and can't be done at the piano.  Mr. Sandor also discusses the physiology of the parts of the human body that go into piano playing from the fingers through the back (and the feet for the pedals).  What I like about his descriptions is his emphasis on coordinating the various elements without strain, pressure, or awkwardness.<br />The second part introduces Mr. Sandor's own notation for marking up scores in relation to technique (which I found surprisingly helpful in understanding his concepts).  He also introduces the various means of playing.  Some people like what he says here, some reject this or that.  What I like most is his way of helping the pianist gain the maximum ability to play the piano by getting out of his own way.  Mr. Sandor simplifies things so you don't waste time trying to do things from awkward positions or through impossibly contradictory methods.  You will find this skill common to all great instructors trying to teach students.  So much can be gained by just being coordinated and efficient.  But what seems simple after the instruction was hopelessly obscure before the master showed you the simple way.<br />The third part of the book is about taking these techniques and applying them in making music.  The author addresses how to recognize when to use the various patterns - how to combine them.  He discusses pedals, practicing, memorization, and performance tips.  He is always so supportive of the student.  For example, in memorization, he discusses that this is a legacy of Liszt and that many wonderful pianists use the open score in performance and it is quite often used in making recordings.  He also says that simply because you might have a memory slip does not indicate that you don't know the piece. It is a human frailty to get distracted and that you should simply get back to it and work a little more without becoming discouraged.<br />Really, I enjoyed this book quite a bit and found some things that are helping me and I think you will be able to find things that will help you.He also says that simply because you might have a memory slip does not indicate that you don't know the piece.

I thought it was quite good then, and I believe this third edition to be an even better book.  It treats the subjects of tonal harmony and voice leading quite well.  There have been some solid improvements in the way a few things are explained and some changes in the musical examples.  However, it is still fundamentally the same sound course for undergraduate music theory it has been since 1978.  However, it now comes in one volume instead of the two volumes of the first edition.<br /><br />The text begins with a quick review of the basics of musical grammar, a brief introduction of the rudiments of musical notation, intervals, rhythm (and meter), chords, and four-part harmony.  Part II talks about the powerful relationship between the tonic and dominant chords, chord progressions elaborating that relationship, and even the dominant as a key area (whether you call it tonicization or modulation is up to you).  Part III discusses the implications of root position, first inversion, and second inversion chords in elaborating harmonies and in sequences.  Part IV is actually about contrapuntal issues, but is framed in a discussion of melodic figuration.  Part V introduces chromaticism, modal mixture, and extends the discussion on uses of seventh chords.  Part VI extends the discussion of chromaticism and includes ninth and eleventh chords, Phrygian II (Neapolitan chords), augmented sixths, and more types of mixture.  There is also important discussion of the implications all this has for voice leading and modulation to other key areas.<br /><br />Some might wish that it contained some treatments of graphical (Schenkerian notation), and I am one of them, but that is a quibble compared to this book's many strengths.  The counter argument is that until the students really have a handle on the basics of harmony and how voice leading is handled through the music of the early twentieth century, there really isn't a way for them to grasp the meaning of the larger structures Schenker's graphical notation was created to represent.  I think that is a fair point, but still think there are some basics in notation that could be introduced early in the process when talking about the basic structure of melodies and supporting harmonies and candential formulas.<br /><br />The explanations are clear and the musical examples apt.  In fact, someone could actually work through this book on his own and grasp what is being presented.  Of course, an instructor is helpful to check work and explain things that remain unclear in the student's mind, but that is really true for any book on any subject.<br /><br />There are some wonderful materials to supplement this text.  The most important are the two work books (WB I - ISBN 0-15-506226-3 / WB II - ISBN 0-15-506234-4.  They are useful exercises that help the student learn the material by actively working through the application of the materials discussed.<br /><br />Another resource that should not be overlooked is the two-CD set (ISBN 0-534-52216-5) that contains performances of the hundreds of musical examples in the textbook (not the workbooks).  It can really help a student to listen to examples that are unclear.  If a student can play them herself or hear them in his head, so much the better, but these discs can enrich reading through the textbook and making sure that you understand what is being presented to you.<br /><br />Kudos to Professors Aldwell and Schachter for this wonderful text and supporting materials.d how voice leading is handled through the music of the early twentieth century, there really isn't a way for them to grasp the meaning of the larger structures Schenker's graphical notation was created to represent.

The book is divided into three parts:<br />1) Intro &amp; Early Phases of Marketing Research (2 chapters)<br />2) Research Design Formulation (10 chapters)<br />3) Data Collection, Preparation, Analysis, and Reporting (11 chapters)<br />Each chapter not only has explanatory text, there are also many helpful pictures,  diagrams, additional resources, cases, key terms &amp; concepts, exercises, internet and computer exercises, and activities.  The back has necessary statistical tables (if you don't have a calculator or spreadsheet handy, notes, an index, and credits.<br />The author is very practical in his approach.  While he provides the necessary technical background and formulas to understand and get the work done, he does not wander off into the theoretical underpinnings of topics such as conjoint analysis.  He wants the student to grasp the implications so far as being able to understand the topic, its implications, and how to implement and make use of the various marketing research concepts and tools.<br />The book also comes with a student version of SPSS 11.0.  This is VERY handy for student project work at home and in developing skills with a popular and serious statistical tool.  The book refers to SPSS many times and explains how it is used in implementing this or that topic under discussion.	2004-05-18

The book is aimed at liberal arts students who want to take a course in the fundamentals of music, however, I think (way) back to my music theory course in high school and this would have been a terrific text for that kind of course as well.<br />Since music making is an activity that involves your mind (and heart), I appreciate Prof. Damschroder's emphasis on learning through doing.  Students will sing, clap, and play their way to understanding the basic grammar of music.  The text starts at the very beginning of musical notation and works its way through rhythm, meter, scales, accidentals, chords, and some chromaticiscm.  By the end of this one term course the student understands the basics of harmonizing simple melodies and can detect errors in notation and matching what they hear with what is written down.  There is a good basic glossary and an appendix with additional musical notation helps.  An index is also provided.<br />Another terrific resource is a CD that contains the musical examples and exercises in the book so the student can work on his or her own and drill themselves a bit and actually work the problems in the book while listening to the exercises through their computer.  I like the fact that the student can choose to hear the examples and exercises as a piano, violin, clarinet, oboe, horn, or saxophone if there are pitches.  If they are rhythm exercises they can listen to them as a piano, harp, clarinet, vibraphone, drum, or woodblock.  It may seem a little thing, but having taught ear training, it does help students to hear examples in the sound they are more familiar in hearing.  String players hear strings more easily, woodwind players like to hear woodwinds, and so forth.<br />The book also comes with a large fold out chart of the keyboard with each key diagrammed to its exact place on the bass or treble clef.  This can be of immeasurable help to non-keyboard players trying to get oriented to reading two staves as a single unit and how they map onto those white and black keys.<br />This is a real achievement and I hope it gets widely adopted.  It certainly can help students in classes, but it is so well done that someone who was interested in learning this material could work through it on their own with the CD.  It might help them to have someone they can go to for help now and again, but things are explained quite well in this book.<br />Oh, and when you first try to use the CD, make sure you go to the preferences FIRST and select the proper output mode for your computer.oriented to reading two staves as a single unit and how they map onto those white and black keys.<br />This is a real achievement and I hope it gets widely adopted.

It is more or less a collection of articles and tips on lawn care.  I certainly found many useful tips and helpful advice as I read through the book.  However, in reading it front to back you will find that Mr. Baker differs in some small details from one presentation to the next, but his overall conception of what goes into a good lawn remains quite consistent throughout.<br />Mr. Baker offers several of his famous tonics that I look forward to trying.  Some of the advice seems a tad dated - he talks about buying things from Brookstone that aren't offered on their website anymore and he doesn't mention his own website [...] that does offer many of them and more.<br />The book discusses different types of grass and weeds, but doesn't offer much in the way of pictures.  There are books that do and I find the pictures of the weeds very helpful in identifying them.  But this book does offer state-by-state help on certain things and resources you can tap to get more information - very helpful.<br />This book is certainly worthy the price I paid for it and I like the tips I picked up.  It isn't perfect, but deserves a place on your shelf.	2004-05-17

The Majors are, of course, The Masters, The US Open, The Open Championship (British Open), and the PGA Championship. Saying that Mark O'Meara won The Masters and the British Open, Lee Janzen the US Open, and Vijay Singh the PGA Championship says almost nothing about the character, history, and the dynamic nature of life and competition on the PGA tour.<br />Mr. Feinstein helps us get to know some of these players as people.  We learn some things about their health, how the got to the PGA tour, how qualifying for the various majors is done (and other tournaments, for that matter).  Of course, the author reports actual competitions and how the leaders changed position and finally emerged victorious.<br />All of this is told in a rather meandering and leisurely style.  If you want crisp, concise, and beginning to end reporting this book really isn't for you.  However, if love golfing anecdotes and enjoy reading about golfing events, I think you will enjoy this book as much as I did.  I learned about players I didn't know and learned more about some that I did know.  Certainly, I learned more about these events we call the Majors and my enjoyment of them has been enhanced because I have read this book.  Thanks to Mr. Feinstein for that favor.	2004-05-16

Not only do we get the context of what went on during the Eisenhower administration when Castro came to power, but we get the context of what was going on in the Soviet Union as well.<br />I did not know that Raul Castro was the committed communist who advocated closer ties with the USSR.  That Fidel was anti-US was always clear, but it was most interesting to read about how the connection between Cuba and the USSR developed and its limitations because of Fidel's undisciplined and independent nature.<br />The back-channel diplomacy was also very interesting to read about and why we didn't learn about the Jupiter missile removal from Turkey until much later was another story I wanted to understand.  For me, the most useful things I learned were the lurching and stumbling nature of the way the USSR and the US played off of and against each other.  Not only were both sides trying to balance the other side, each side was also trying to be provocative as well.<br />The book also notes that the Soviets saw the Kennedy assassination as the work of a far right wing conspiracy led by H.L. Hunt, although they had no real evidence but the word of journalist Paul Ward.  They refused to believe that the President's security services could have allowed a lone madman to shoot the President (as was actually the case).<br />The book ends with a brief discussion of coup that removed Khrushchev and put Brezhnev in power.<br />The book is written very well and has a rich supply of notes and documentation backing up the story the authors report.  I think it is a fascination and important book from the most dangerous period in the Cold War.	2004-05-05

First, it knows its audience.  While generalities are subject to all kinds of exceptions, entrepreneurs tend to be active people.  This book is written concisely, but covers a comprehensive list of subject.  However, it is essential to understand that it doesn't cover any of the subjects exhaustively.  It is more like a tour of finance for entrepreneurs.  Few people who have what it takes to start businesses will handle all of the financial subjects covered in this book without help and advice from professionals (nor should they), but every businessperson should have an understanding of every subject in this book at least to the level discussed in this very fine book.<br />The treatment of forecasting, sources of funding, and valuation (including cash flow analysis) are vital topics that too many entrepreneurs treat too cursorily.  The discussion in this book is certainly not sufficient to make you an expert on any of these subjects, but sill certainly assist you in becoming sufficiently conversant to speak knowledgably with professionals or prepare you for deeper study.  The discussion of accounting is a very quick introduction to the subject and will definitely require deeper study unless you are going to completely outsource your accounting.<br />I think this is a terrific textbook that could be used as part of a one term course on the subject and hope that it gets adopted at many universities, colleges, and I could even see it used in specialized high school settings for the right kind of bright and driven students.<br />The material in the book isn't particularly hard, but it is broad.  While it can be read alone (especially if you have some familiarity with the subject), it will definitely benefit most students to have the guiding hand of a skilled instructor, class discussions, and applied projects.<br />I think this is a fine and successful book that will benefit many.	2004-05-03

Ben Hogan was a revered name, but one of past glory.  His great year of 1953 was in the past.  I had heard about his auto accident and his amazing comeback, but this book helped me see the man who \\"dug it out of the dirt\\" through hard work, discipline, and ferocious tenacity.<br />Mr. Hogan started out with less than most.  His father's suicide and the family's subsequent poverty didn't leave him with many open paths to success.  He found golf and found that it not only matched his physical skills, but was an even better match for his nearly obsessive temperament.<br />The swing he developed has become the pattern millions of us try to emulate, although he would find our haphazard approach to the game less than useless.  Why we love being duffers would be beyond him.  He knew how to work and to practice.  I still cannot fathom the kind of internal strength it would take to come back from that terrible leg shattering accident when his Cadillac was struck by a bus.  He played in great pain for the rest of his life and had four surgeries on his left shoulder.  When I realize that his greatest achievements and most of his wins at major tournaments were after the accident I am simply dumbstruck.<br />Mr. Hogan was a very private and enigmatic figure.  Mr. Sampson does a good job in teasing what facts we know into a good story.  We get interesting stories from the golf side of his life (mostly stories told about Hogan by others) and those are very enjoyable.  However, I like the way Mr. Sampson puts all that in the context of a real person - a real man.  Ben Hogan wasn't a fictional character even though the media version of him was a distortion of the actual hard working man who practiced, practiced, and then practiced some more, who loved his wife, Valerie, and built a successful golf equipment business.<br />Ben Hogan made a long journey through life and I think this book tells the story well.and I think this book tells the story well.	2004-04-29

Of course they aren't real life, but they do serve to illustrate certain points in a way that requires creative interpretation and solution rather than simple problem solving.  Prof. Glen Urban does a fine job of pairing up really interesting chapters on the issues of marketing in the digital age with cases that focus in on the points he is trying to make.<br />This is NOT a book on building a web business or developing a web strategy for your business.  Rather, it is a book for Marketing Managers to help them think through the implications for their efforts in the age of the Internet.  Prof. Urban focuses on something he calls a Trust relationship, which involves giving the customer loads of information, innovation, and choice.  He compares that to the standard low-price relationship he calls Push marketing.  All of this culminates in the chapter and case on Citibank's online efforts.<br />It isn't required that you agree with every point the author makes to derive a lot of benefit from the book.  I think it would make a very nice text for a marketing course that focuses on the implications of the web, Internet, and computers for segmenting the market, product positioning, product introduction, communicating with customers, pricing and distribution channel, and the idea of a Trust Relationship with customers.  All good stuff that needs to be thought about.	2004-04-21

702765:US	53052943	RSSONZYBEHL7	0500281297	436302588	The Lords of Tikal: Rulers of an Ancient Maya City	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Very good read on the entire span of history at Tikal	The city we call Tikal was called something like Mutul by its Mayan inhabitants and was inhabited continuously for about 1,700 years.  While there has been magnificent archaeological and translating work done in recent years, the foundation of what we know of Tikal was laid in a great excavating and mapping project done by the University of Pennsylvania from 1955 until 1969.  The author of this book, Peter D. Harrison, Ph.D. had participated in these (and other) excavations and brings that first hand authority to this very interesting book.<br />Dr. Harrison starts with the pre-history of Tikal and ends with the little we know of its inhabitants after the collapse in the 9th century.  However, most of the book centers on the succession of 30 rulers (Kings, Lords, or whatever you want to call them).  We know who most of these people were because of the Mayan predilection for documenting great events by erecting great monuments that had writing on them that we can now read (mostly).<br />The author also shares important understanding of the building of the great palaces and temples and shows us their important orientations and relationships with each other.  Since what we see today is the decayed form of the final state of Tikal, I found it fascinating to work backward and realize all that wasn't there when the city was at its height of power and influence.  The great pyramids we associate with the city today were late additions by an important set of rulers, but by no means the most powerful the city had known.<br />The book is full of pictures, great drawings, maps, and even some beautiful color plates.  There is also a page on when and how to visit Tikal that would be very helpful for those intending to visit the site.  There are also many helpful notes and an index.<br />I have two tiny nits to pick with the book, however.  The first is that for several of the maps I had to use a magnifying glass to read the labels for the buildings.  The second is even less important and I am not convinced that the author didn't make the better choice.  However, when I am reading about Mayan culture I like to see the dates given in the Long Count format when applicable with our western dates in parenthesis.  The reason for wanting the Long Count is to easily see when events are associated with important dates.  Dr. Harrison does give these Long Count dates in the notes, but uses our calendar for the dates in the text (most of the time).<br />Anyway, these do not detract from the immense value of the book or the fun I had reading it.

This terrific reporting done by Chris Lydgate reveals a lot to me that the strange episode of the kid getting caned for vandalism did not.<br />I did not know of the one party rule in that city-state and the ruthless and extreme measures taken to keep that power in the hands of the PAP.  Small states in hostile areas often justify their need for police state measures because of their size and context in the nations around them.  However, in nearly all those cases the threat never ends and the police powers are the normal way of life.  In Singapore dissent was crushed by torture and long imprisonments (decades) without ever being charged with anything.  This kind of brutality is beyond the comprehension of Americans.  Why?  Why the need to keep power by any means?  This kind of government corrupts the fabric of the society it claims to protect.<br />Mr. Lydgate brings us the story of one Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam.  He is a person who has given everything to the fight for social justice and political plurality in Singapore.  Mr. Jeyaretnam is a man of talents and strength who led the opposition party (the Workers Party) to the PAP.  The PAP used EVERY means to drive Jeyaretnam out of government including the courts.  Singapore apparently has very strange laws about defamation and the PAP influence on the courts makes these strange laws subject to even stranger interpretations.  For example, the suit that finally broke Mr. Jeyaretnam happened because he mentioned that an associate had placed a report on the podium in front of him.  Somehow that constituted an endorsement of what was in the report!  This subjected him to hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines and court costs.<br />This kind of abuse of the legal system to break anyone who would speak out is obscene to Americans.  As are the threats of the prime minister to not refurbish the government-subsidized buildings in districts that voted for the opposition.  These naked power plays seem something out of America's Tammany Hall days.<br />Singapore suffers from being a country that is really a huge city.  The Prime Minister is a mayor with too much power over the other aspects of government.  It isn't big enough to have sufficient other structures to dilute his power.  While Singaporeans justly resent outside influence and recommendations for improvement, I think the advanced democracies need to work to make Singapore a more open and free society in terms of the rights of speech and freedom from government harassment for raising questions.<br />Mr. Jeyaretnam is the hero of this book and yet in his old age he is reduced to selling books from a stand on the street and is still harassed by hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines and court costs.  Lovers of freedom and pluralism in the west should reach out and help the aged warrior.  There must be some agency that could put together a fund to help him live the dignified life he deserves.<br />Thanks to Mr. Lydgate for bringing our attention to this important story and this hero of Singapore.to not refurbish the government-subsidized buildings in districts that voted for the opposition.

It provides a comprehensive overview of art music in the twentieth century; a topic that is not given the attention it deserves.  Mr. Watkins demonstrates a unique breadth of knowledge of the music of the last hundred plus years and he also posseses a rare depth of insight into the wonderfully rich flowering of musical styles and the connection of those styles to the larger artistic culture in painting, sculpture, literature, poetry, theatre, and dance.<br /><br />This book is so rich in explanation and insight that it is impossible to take in all it has to offer in a single front to back reading.  It is one of those texts that rewards deep and repeated study.  You will want to return not only for its texts, musical examples, and images, but also for its rich notes and references.<br /><br />The book opens by giving us wonderful background in the cultural movements in Vienna and Paris from 1885 through the first year of the First World War.  The next two parts lay out the way new movements and views arose in Europe from 1909-1930.  The next two sections brilliantly demonstrate the rise and aims of national movements and the way the first and second world wars caused artists to create works aiming beyond nationalism.  Serialism and the search for new sounds are the subjects of the next two sections.  The book closes with a survey of the art music of the late twentieth century including its movements in synthesizing earlier composers into new musical movements and the way classic forms were re-used and re-interpreted.<br /><br />Mr. Watkins tells us these great stories by providing wonderful readings of aptly chosen works that connect and illuminate all these movements.  It isn't a continuous narrative of one thing after another.  Instead, we get the benefit of seeing great works up close and in their proper cultural context.  For me, one of the great benefits of this book was the way it opened up the connections between painting, sculpture, and literature to the music of this period.  I had studied that for the Baroque, Classic, and Romantic periods, but had not been given that insight into the twentieth century.  And this book does it better than anything I have seen for those previous centuries.  Reading this book was an electric experience for me.  It is just so intensely packed with insight and revelation.  At least it was for me.ture to the music of this period.

There are many very good reasons to be concerned about the ways technology can be used to curtail our civil liberties and constrict our freedoms.  I had hoped for a serious discussion laying out the problems, their current state of application and misuse, and some thoughts about how to push back.<br />We do get some of that and to the extent this book is in this scope I like it a great deal (for example, the discussions around eternal copyrights and huge commercial databases gathering everything known about each of us or the sale of drivers license photos to commercial interests).  When it is in the middle area of discussing thought crime and brain wiretapping he begins to lose me.  It isn't that the issues aren't worthy of discussion, it is simply they way he discusses them has too much of a paranoid science fiction future feel.<br />When he paints the future of conscious machines and whether they will demand civil rights or not, well, I think he spoils this book.  That speculative stuff should be in a different book.  For me, the inclusion of this material makes it impossible to take seriously the good stuff he does have.  The weird apple spoils the barrel kind of thing.<br />It isn't that the book isn't worth reading.  It's that the serious stuff is so important that we need to focus on that and not be distracted by paranoid delusions about things that don't even exist.  There is plenty to be concerned about in the databases already collected and being sold in commercial markets.	2004-04-07

Like nearly everyone, I don't read Greek.  However, I know that the New Testament was written in that language.  This book gives the King James Version in English with the Strong reference numbers above each word and the Greek for that verse in the margin.  After you read in here for awhile you begin to recognize and recognize Greek words.  That feels really cool.<br />In the back of the book are several useful aids.  First there are some grammatical aids and a guide to transliteration (which helps if you are going to try and sound out the Greek).  Next comes the editor's own Lexical Aids to the New Testament.  This is incredibly useful.  If the Strong number is in boldface you can look the number up in this section and find an extended discussion of the word's meaning and use in the New Testament.<br />Next is a Greek Concordance with every Greek word given with its English counterpart's Strong Concordance number.  Three are several other helps included in this volume including the Strong Bible Dictionary.<br />You can spend hours, days, months, and years in this book and never use it up completely.  There is just so much here for the student of the New Testament who wants to go beyond a surface reading of the English translation.  There isn't anything wrong with English translations.  It is just that this book will give you a richer understanding the choices the editors of your favorite translation made in putting the Greek original into our tongue.<br />I am grateful to have this on my bookshelf.	2004-04-05

The background it provides helps me to understand the social contexts and the way of life of the folks Austen and Dickens (and their many fellow writers) wrote about.<br />The book is a series of small essays that offer insight into a specific topic.  These essays are grouped into helpful sections such as The Public World, The Private World, and The Grim World.  They are all entertaining and help those of us who know little of those times to get a handle on some basic notions.<br />The one caution I would offer is that a century is a long time.  Fashion, technology, politics, and everything else changes many times over the decades.  However, these essays seem focused on those things that would offer the most confusion to the modern reader.  Just be sure to keep a close regard on the time period the specific essay is covering and match that to the period not only of the author but the period that Dickens or Austen or whomever is writing about.<br />This is an lively, entertaining, and informative book.  But it is not foolproof.  Enjoy it responsibly and you will benefit from this book every time you read a Regency or Victorian author.	2004-04-04

It is another in a long line of books that teases out of some present trend a future that seems wondrous, somewhat frightening, and somehow plausible.  Mr. Kurzweil's thesis is that the next step of evolution will be that our own machines will attain consciousness through their sheer capacity and the powerful software we will write.  At some point they will become more intelligent than humans and so forth.<br />I think two things he includes in the book point to the problem (even though the author really thinks he has convincingly dealt with them).  First, on page 72 he includes a wonderful cartoon with two scientists working on a complicated formula on the blackboard.  The words \\"Then a Great Miracle Occurs\\" are written in the middle of the formula.  One of the scientists, pointing to these words says, \\"I think you should be more explicit here in step two\\".  The weakness of this book is similar.  There are lots of specific claims, but nothing much provable.<br />The timeline 261-280 is also in the tradition of these kinds of books.  Lots of detail and specifics from the past up until the publication date of this book (which was 1999).  Then we skip TEN YEARS to 2009 - a date near enough to give the book a plausible relevance, but far enough in the future that the book won't be disproved until long after it has become irrelevant.  Oh, well...<br />As I said, there are interesting things here to read and think about, but in many ways this is really a work of science fantasy rather than a serious analysis of the future of society and technology.	2004-04-04

The book is laid out logically starting with putting and the short game and works its way back to the tee.  I think that is a very sound approach.  This book really isn't a golf method, but you can certainly use it to look up the part of your game you are interested in working on and looking through how Tiger does it.  I find that kind of thing helpful.  And there are a lot of photographs. I find it helpful to put those images in my head as I am trying to get myself thinking right in trying to make a shot.<br />While this book is certainly up to date and more modern than Nicklaus' \\"Golf My Way\\" or Penick's books, I don't think it is better than theirs.  Maybe that is prejudice on my part, but I think they are better teachers of the game and go more in depth on what you are trying to do and why. Tiger explains what he does and is pretty light on the theory.  But who cares?  The book says it is just about how Tiger plays golf and that is what it delivers?<br />Did Tiger write this book?  Probably not.  I am sure he thought about it and talked it through with the folks who put it together.  I have no idea.  It is all written in the first person, but has a sort of distanced style of writing that is often a tip off that someone else wrote it for him.  But it is certainly Tiger in the pictures and I believe that Tiger agrees with what is in here.  So, at that level it is a pretty useful book for someone who wants to think about how a virtuoso of the highest caliber plays this difficult sport.	2004-04-03

His goal is to try and offer a framework to modernize the work charities do.  He wants to rename charities into community corporations and recognize that there are more efficient ways to use these resources.<br />I think he is right that we can always do better.  That we can always do better does away with the notion that there is a one best way to do things, doesn't it?  He is far more enamored of United Way than I am.  I think Mr. Egger's proposals take too much power away from those who do the giving.  I know he thinks he is a professional and knows better, but organizations such as United Way become very political and I don't want to be co-opted by them to move my money to those whose values and goals I support.  He especially bemoans the high percentage of directed funds in the DC chapter of the United Way.<br />I also think he is wrong in his denigration of the kind of charity work Carnegie and Rockefeller did.  He supposes they used improper means to gather their millions out of society making it poorer and then gave it back.  In fact, they made society immeasurable richer by getting them better and cheaper steel and light (Rockefeller's kerosene was cheaper and cleaner than whale oil) than they previously had.<br />But that isn't really the point here and I don't want to distract from the author's goals.  He writes in an earnest way.  He uses lots of stories.  Don't expect scholarly writing or research.  He is writing from his own experience and his heart.  He has learned a lot from his work.  I learned some things from him as well.<br />If you want to get a current view of non-profits, community corporations, charities, or whatever you want to call them, this is a pretty good place to begin.	2004-04-03

For many of us, it is his voice we associate with listening to ballgames on summer evenings.  Well, Mr. Harwell was also a writer.  During the 1990s he wrote a short column for the Free Press over the years.  The columns are only a few hundred words each, but they are keen observations of the team and the sport.  While the columns come from the 90s, he makes observations and tells stories from many decades.  They are quite interesting, well written, and easy to read.  They sound like the kind of thing he would say through the mike if he had a few minutes to fill with his thoughts.<br />Some of these columns have been used elsewhere, but this is still a volume worth having if you are a Harwell fan and fan of the Tigers.  The longer you have followed the Tigers the more his stories will mean as they bring back memories of players and games.  I am glad to have it on my shelf.	2004-04-03

It is easy to read and very thought provoking.  While many of the ideas and strategies seem like common sense, a few of the strategies are ideas that women (and mean) can benefit from employing no matter what their career and salary level.  I enjoyed this book and gained a lot of insight.<br />One of the strategies that especially caught my eye, called \\"The Trap\\", was given the motto \\"bite off more than you can chew, but not so much you choke.\\"  This idea involved stretching yourself but not too thin and also emphasized that some women can be too hard on themselves, extremely impatient or overly meticulous.  This dealt with taking some risk and possibly get in over your head and not realizing you need to cut yourself some slack and instead pushing even harder until you snap.  The author used many interviewees comments and experiences as well as her known to clearly illustrate both the danger and the handling of \\"The Trap\\".<br />The bottom line of these strategies is that it is not what type of career you pick (all different fields from musicians and artists to CEO were represented), what company you work for (or not), what your education or your background is, but how you use your mental, emotional, physical and spiritual strengths and improve them by following the laid out strategies that will determine whether you can be a \\"six-figure woman\\" or man.	2004-04-01

In those times people began to systematically look at ancient artifacts and began to try and explain them with something more than a myth.  Sure, there were many ideas that seem ridiculous to us.  However, we can rest assured that 500 years from now many ideas we accept as well known fact will seem equally preposterous.<br />I think the book is most helpful for a person, whether student or general reader, who wants to get some background on what archaeology is about, what some of the big achievements have been, some of the fiascos, and where the field stood about 1990-95.  The last chapter speculating on current issues and the future is the weakest.  It just raises some political correctness subjects such as women's issues and sore points such as the Elgin Marbles in the British Museum.<br />I wish they had raised more technically important issues and laid out a better sense of the real frontier rather than listing subjects that seem like they are trying to make the subject relevant. But these are only a few pages in an otherwise fine text.<br />The volume is wonderfully illustrated with drawings and photographs that enhance the story told in the text.<br />There is a chronology from 1500, a page of texts for further reading, a page of acknowledgements, and an index.	2004-03-30

These books are just one of the additional reasons some of us refer to Brian Lamb as Saint Brian.  The chapters are digests of the information gleaned during the actual Booknotes broadcasts.  Each one is from an individual author and in this case, it is on the lives of famous Americans.<br /><br />There are something like 80 to 85 of these biographical vignettes.  Some of them are autobiographical when the author being interviewed about their book was also a notable American in their own right.  We all know Mr. Lamb's unique style of quantum interviewing (one can never predict the precise location of his next question).  These edited and assembled pieces have a somewhat more organized and focused feel, but there is still a bit of the Cooks Tour approach to each subject.<br /><br />Having watched many of the shows from which these articles were made and also having read several of the books by these authors, I can still say that even when the material here is familiar it is still fun to dash through because it is so concisely presented and decently edited.  When the material is unfamiliar it is very delightful and an invitation to more study and investigation.<br /><br />I am not only happy to have this dandy book, I am actually grateful for it.  It is a marvelous tool for introducing children to biographical subjects!<br /><br />The book also has an index and a list of all the Booknotes programs through the publishing date of the book.	2004-03-25

Mr. Hinckley illustrates his points with many stories from his own experience and some borrowed anecdotes.  He has organized the chapters into two parts.  Each of the 10 virtues he discusses is given its own chapter in the first part.  The second part has two essays: one on marriage and the other on the family.  He has an epilogue that discusses the lonely position of moral leadership.<br /><br />It is in this epilogue that the seemingly simple virtues discussed in the book are revealed for the difficult principles they actually are.  People who say this book is simplistic or naïve can make that point somewhat persuasively until they understand that the author is fully aware of the massive difficulties we frail humans have in living up to these ideals in a complex and constantly changing world.  We are so easily dissuaded from persisting in virtue and adopting an easier go-with-the-flow approach to life.  We need the kind of reminder this book offers and I am glad to have read it and to refer to it in order to clear my vision and to refocus myself on doing what I should rather than what is easy.<br /><br />The book has some notes that supply references for some of the information in the book and a helpful index.	2004-03-24

The book opens with a wonderfully apt quote from Upton Sinclair: \\"It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it.\\"  The drive for Earnings Per Share (EPS) by analysts and investors guided by them, according to the author, leads them astray because the number is inherently imprecise.  Earnings are stated by the company as an exact figure and EPS is simply that number divided by the number of outstanding shares of common stock.<br />However, earnings depend a great deal on the methods of accounting used by the firm.  In the 90s we saw a rise in very aggressive accounting.  Any system of rules that is intended to be applied generally over a wide range differing conditions is going to have gaps and unintended effects that distort the intention of the rules.  General rules rely upon the good will and integrity of the participants to keep the intention or spirit of the rules in tact in order for the rules to have any real meaning in application.  In sports we also have referees to keep the game fair, but both teams still have to intend to follow the rules completely.  No game could be played if the participants tried to push every rule to an extreme interpretation.  Aggressive accounting uses extreme interpretations of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) to present as favorable earnings number as possible.  This results in a higher (and therefore more pleasing) EPS number.<br />Analysts started giving forecasts of coming EPS reports for firms and those that met or slightly exceeded that forecast were rewarded with higher share prices because investors competed for their shares.  Those that missed the forecast by even a penny per share were punished as investors abandoned their stock.  Mr. Berenson demonstrates that many companies had reserves and other accounting tricks to make sure their EPS forecasts were always met.  However, as companies grow this becomes harder to do.  And for companies such as Tyco, Enron, Adelphia, and even the mighty General Electric, it finally became impossible.  The most aggressive companies had presented such a distorted picture of reality that they collapsed.  Those that were still within shouting distance of reality remained solvent, but still suffered a significant depression in their stock price.<br />Since the EPS is inherently inexact it seems strange that the markets would react so strongly to that single measure.  Mr. Berenson calls the number a lie.  I think he does that for rhetorical effect and one time he does admit it is a white lie.  I think he has a very strong point for those companies using aggressive interpretations of GAAP.  The author also provides a history of the SEC and calls for stronger enforcement powers and the staff to provide that enforcement.  While there is certainly a good case to have an effective SEC with sufficient resources (there will be a debate on what this level is), Mr. Berenson has more faith in regulation than I do.<br />Even if I fully concede his point and support an SEC of enormous size, it still could not provide the necessary enforcement to keep companies in line if the market keeps rewarding companies for fudging the numbers.  The market will provide what people want to buy even if they want to buy lies.  I agree with Mr. Berenson that INVESTORS need to become better educated and make more demands of the management of the companies in which they invest.  Investors, by NOT investing in companies who use very aggressive accounting, could affect the way finances are reported than any regulatory body.<br />Not every company can be a growth company.  Heck, even Microsoft isn't a Microsoft anymore.  Investors have to demand that financial statements actually present a real picture of the financial state of the firm rather then providing a manufactured dream of ever expanding growth.  One of the strengths of this book is the compelling evidence Mr. Berenson provides of management spinning these euphoric visions just long enough to cash out and then let the bad news (read reality) come to light on someone else's watch.<br />This is a fine book.  I think that anyone who has investments in public companies ought to read it and better educated themselves on the realities of the equities marketplace.  I think Mr. Berenson's recommendations for public policy are measured and good for debate even if I don't personally agree with all of them.  There are a few minor quibbles I have with some of his explanations, but they don't affect my recommendation.<br />The book has a couple of short appendices to help the reader understand the accounting issues involved.  There are helpful notes for sources and an index.the strengths of this book is the compelling evidence Mr. Berenson provides of management spinning these euphoric visions just long enough to cash out and then let the bad news (read reality) come to light on someone else's watch.<br />This is a fine book.

Especially those related to the Kennedy Assassination and the Gulf of Tonkin.  They give strong evidence for what Johnson knew and believed at the time rather than the much later revisions of what he is supposed to have believed.  Mr. Beschloss have provided a great service to us so we can get to the reality of things rather than the thrice-spun revisions too many books, movies, and TV shows spew out in order to advance some cockamamie view of the world.<br />It is also interesting to read his conversations with folks on a personal basis.  The chitchat is quite helpful in seeing Johnson as a person.  His private opinions of the Warren Commission and of Oswald's role in the assassination are also fascinating.<br />Mr. Beschloss also supplies helpful footnotes to provide context and clarify so of the statements that would otherwise be opaque.  There is also an appendix telling us why we have access to the tapes now rather than in 2023 or later as was Johnson's intention (short answer: Oliver Stone's film \\"JFK\\" led congress to open up virtually all records on the assassination to help quell the paranoia of conspiracy theorists).  There is also a list of the people included in the book with a line about who they are and their birth and death dates.  There is also an appendix including a few conversations specifically on the Warren Commission Report.<br />I bought my copy as a first edition with the attached audiotape of a few selections.  It would be nice to get these tapes in a complete version on DVD.	2004-03-23

It has fifteen chapters.  Each is devoted to a range of history or change in culture.  This segmentation is quite useful in keeping aspects of the history straight in one's mind.<br />While I knew that Egypt wasn't a single culture through time, I never had a clear sense of who was doing what where and when.  This book provides a wonderful cure for that problem.  Obviously, there are lifetimes to be spent by specialists in the endless aspects of these cultures.  However, there is a lot to be gained by having a better overview and some understanding of these things by generalists.  I am glad to have this book on my shelf.<br />Each chapter is loaded with interesting pictures, drawings, color plates, and maps.  Each chapter has a section for further reading in the back of the book.  There is also a glossary, a chronology, a list of sources for the illustrations, and an index.	2004-03-22

Some will have different views of the guidance this book provides, but for the general writer this book can be very helpful.  There is an essay in the back: \\"On Usage, Pedantry, Grammar, and the Orderly Mind\\".  The more you agree with this essay the more you will like this book.  And the more you find yourself disagreeing with the essay you will find yourself disliking this book.<br />It is organized in a way that looks like a dictionary, but you may or may not be using the same word or phrase as the book to find a specific topic.  So, there is an Inventory of Main Entries in the front of the book you can quickly scan to find what you are looking for and then turn to that term in the main part of the book.<br />There is a lot of personal preference in deciding whether you like Fowler or Follett and which edition of either of them you choose.  But I think any of them is better than struggling on your own.  Even if you disagree with the book's recommendations you will have made a more informed choice.  You will find your writing more confident and more clear.  Isn't that enough?	2004-03-19

According to the introduction, this book contains about 2/3 of Mozart's surviving correspondence.  It has letters from and to Mozart and the translations are very lively and bring the personality of the composer to life.  In older translations it seems that care was taken to make him sound like the monumental cultural force that he has become.  But in this book, Mozart is a boy, a young man, a young husband, a fiery genius, and at times lost, grieving, and even confused.<br />The book is organized chronologically and provides biographical information that gives each letter some context.  There are many useful footnotes as well as a couple of maps and list of Mozart's travels.  The author has even included some notes about the various currencies in order to help the reader understand the discussions of money in the letters.<br />I can't emphasize enough what a lively read this book is.  I found that I simply didn't get bogged down and enjoyed reading it.  Yes, there are some portions of some letters I skipped, but that is one of the beauties of the book.  You don't get lost simply because you skipped some mundane portions of one letter or another.<br />Mr. Spaethling is to be congratulated on this fine achievement.  If you are interested in Mozart in any way, this book will deepen your appreciation of the living breathing person who wrote all that music.  It didn't come from some alien dimension.  Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, this wonderful and complex human being did it all and we are much richer for it.	2004-03-19

For example, the John Keegan book was a concise military history recounting the politics and battlefield actions of the war.  Niall Ferguson's \\"The Pity of War\\" set out to explain WWI and offers an iconoclastic view that attempts to show how it was not inevitable.  What these and the others really do lack is a sense of the cultures that were torn apart, reshaped and died.<br />As I was reading \\"Proof Through The Night\\" I was shocked how vividly Professor Watkins evokes the cultural issues of the times leading up to the War, the convulsions during the War, and the cultural memory and recounting of these events that echo even today.  Most of us know little of that time and we don't understand the roots of present issues.  We see the surfaces and strange interactions.  We see artifacts from the past, but do not understand their context and react all too anachronistically to them.  While we are entitled to reinterpret the past and use what we will and how we wish to use it, there is so much to be gained by at least making an attempt to come to terms with what those who lived meant to say to each other and to us by inheritance.  We cheat ourselves of our patrimony by only shallowly understanding the culture of a time.<br />Professor Watkins surveys cultural issues that were active in Great Britain, France, Italy, Germany - Austria, and the U. S. neighboring to the war years.  He does this by demonstrating what was happening in painting, sculpture, drama, popular culture, and above all, music.  He takes us deep inside a few pieces such as Ravel's \\"Tombeau de Couperin\\"(particularly the Toccata), certain paintings of Otto Dix and the music of Hindemith to the work of Matthias Gruenewald, and Britten's \\"War Requiem\\" to the resolution and memory of the Great War even in 1961.<br />There is so much in this wonderful book that I cannot even begin to list more than a few incidental points.  I really do want you to get a copy and immerse yourself in it.  Professor Watkins has provided us with so much that I found I had to take my time and read other things to get more background to get full enjoyment from this treasure.<br />There is a CD that contains 17 tracks of some of the most important pieces he refers to in the book.  They are chosen well and you will never hear them the same after reading the deep context this book provides.  There are also many wonderful pictures and illustrations in the book.  The only wish I have is that at least some of them could have been in color.  But you know how it is with \\"academic\\" books.<br />There are also many pages of footnotes (endnotes).  Nowadays most footnotes are simply citations of references. Not here.  There is a great deal of valuable and enlightening information on these pages and I encourage you to read them.<br />This book should not be ignored.  I believe reading about the culture and the wrenching changes during and after the War will actually tell you more about your life today and its connection to that time than a shelf full of books on battlefield struggles, troop movements, and weapons development.  It isn't the usual way to read about War, but it is terrific.<br />Everyone - at least everyone who cares about WWI- should read this book.e than a few incidental points.

First, it is a very important account of one of the great tragedies of our time.  It upsets me that we still only speak of this tragedy without enough specificity.  It is too often just a conversation about the million killed in Rwanda without enough focus on who did the killing.  It wasn't just a tribe against another.  It was people hacking others to death.  This book gets us to some of those individuals - both those murdered and those murdering - and that is the chief reason to appreciate the book and thank Mr. Gourevitch for it.<br />However, I wish there some images in the book beyond the couple of maps.  Yes, Mr. Gourevitch is a fine writer and helps us see with words.  But this kind of genocide cries out for photographic documentation.  Maybe there isn't any that is appropriate for the book.  But I feel the lack just the same.<br />Finally, this is an important document of the Rwandan terror, but it isn't the final story.  It isn't the complete story.  That has yet to be written.  But I found reading this book a strange sort of nightmare.  Everything seems real and it has its own frightening impetus, but it is like a dream where you want things to stop but it won't.  It is horrifying and even worse because it all happened to real people and in our time.<br />And notice how everyone runs from accountability.  It seems like everyone wants to pretend someone else did it and when you find someone who actually can't run away from involvement they want to pretend it was some awful force that made people unavoidably crazy and should therefore be forgotten.  What hogwash.<br />Thanks to Mr. Gourevitch for getting these stories in print for us.  I hope we burn these stories in our memory.	2004-03-15

This book was and remains a triumph.  We still mourn the loss of Linda Schele and are grateful the Mary Ellen Miller continues her work and teaching at Yale.<br />The book makes clear the Mayan Kings were not Emperors.  They were rulers of city-states that competed with one another.  They also had a spiritual role in the life of those they ruled.  This book discusses how one became a Mayan King, life in the court, the role of bloodletting and visions (hallucinations?), warfare and human sacrifice, the all-important ballgame, the Mayan concept of afterlife and Xibalba, and the Mayan view of the cosmos.  All fascinating topics and the articles are written quite well.  I find them to be a captivating read.<br />The selection of images for the book is fabulous.  This book can make a wonderful coffee table book, they are that beautiful.  However, the articles are far superior to most books you find on coffee tables.  I remember seeing Maya Blue (the shade that the Mayans painted on a great many of the monuments and sculptures) for the first time in this book.  Having seen it in person since then I can tell you the shade is captured very faithfully in the photographs in this book.<br />Much has been written since 1986 and new discoveries and new examinations of existing discoveries deepen our understanding of the Maya.  But this book still stands strong and valuable.  It is not too technical for the general reader and still has value for the student.  I am glad to have my copy on a shelf of favorite books.	2004-03-13

The include the origins of the Crusades, Songs, Architecture, Islam, later Crusade Movements, Military Orders, and how they Crusades have impacted art in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, as well as how they live on into our time.  The articles are of a very high quality.  While they are written for the general reader, they don't pander.  They are well written and the more attention you give the articles the more you will take away.<br />As the title indicates, this book is richly illustrated with black and white images, maps, and many color plates.  There is also a chronology of the Crusades (they really aren't a single event), a very nice list for further study, and a good index.<br />In light of the events of our time, this is one of the books you can turn to in order to get some background of how Europe and the Middle East have interacted for the past millennium in order to get some background on the cultural baggage weighing on what is happening today.  Today never flows directly out of the past; it is a confluence of various streams from the past with different currents, flow, and debris.  Unless you are already a specialist, you will learn many helpful things from these essays.	2004-03-13

This very valuable compilation of historically important news articles and its companion (Part One) should be on the shelf of every person who wants to gain a deeper understanding of the Vietnam War.  I can't review the articles contained, but know that there are many important pieces.  Some of them are the Doris Kearns article on LBJ, John McCain's article on his captivity, Michael Kinsley on Kissinger and Harvard, several on the various incursions in countries neighboring Vietnam, and several on the fall of South Vietnam.<br />Some of the other famous inclusions are Seymour Hersh on My Lai and James Michener on Kent State, and Stewart Alsop on how the draft was implemented expressed America's Class System.  There are many more.<br />But as I said about Part One, you will also need to read other things.  This collection really only represents one side of the debate.  At the time it was not as one sided as everyone remembers now.  There really was support for the war in the population.  Yes, it declined as time passed, but even today many feel that we lost more because we mishandled things more than because the war was wrong.  However, that is neither here nor there for this collection.  It is a terrific collection.  My point is that you can't know the war and how it affected America without reading these articles.  But you also can't know its full effects without reading more than these articles.	2004-03-11

This is a terrifically important analysis of the way the military and the press interacted during the Vietnam War.  Mr. Hammond covers most of the important media events and reports important details of the statements and actions of those in the government and the military as well as those in the press.  He also provides keen insight into the implications of those interactions and the effects they hand on later events.<br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough.  I wish I could give it six stars.  It is a book that anyone who wants to understand anything at all about the Vietnam War simply has to read.  The articles in the two volumes of the Library of America series provide valuable background for this book and I think they should be read first.  But even without them any reader would get a great deal from this book.<br />There are nearly fifty pages of notes, and index, and a generous number of pictures of the main events and participants.  Just a wonderful achievement.  Thanks to Mr. Hammond!	2004-03-11

This runs from roughly the beginning of American involvement (first US advisors killed) to the time public opinion moved solidly against the war.  The articles included here are all of Hall of Fame caliber.  The names of the reporters included read like a who's who of reporting.  Almost all of these went on to huge careers and shelves full of awards.  Reading the reporting included here is often chilling and terrifying and brings back a bunch of memories.<br />However, it is not a balanced collection.  This is a collection from the side that one the public debate - the anti-war side.  And that is fine.  I certainly am not disparaging this volume or what is included.  Just don't expect to recapture the public debate that raged in the US about the Vietnam War.  This is reporting from great reporters in the field and they were largely or later moved to become strong voices against the war.<br />And this is print reporting (although it does include one article by Walter Cronkite).  It doesn't (and can't) capture the effect the evening news reporting had on the home front.  There were also big picture magazines like Life and Look that are gone now.  I particularly remember an issue of Life, I think it was.  It may have been Look.  I am not sure.  This issue included the names and faces of EVERY soldier killed or wounded that WEEK.  It was pages and pages and pages of faces of young men.  I was a boy then so they were just men to me.  From where I sit today, however, they were just boys.  All dead or maimed.  It was a very powerful and the impact is cannot be captured in a book such as this.  That isn't to detract from this book.  It is simply that as great as this reporting was it isn't the whole story about what happened to move the public against the war.<br />The book includes a block of pictures of the reporters included in the book and some helpful maps of Vietnam.  If you are interested in reading some great reporters writing about Vietnam at the time it was happening, this is a very fine volume.  Just don't think it is all there is to know about what was said about Vietnam at the time.s writing about Vietnam at the time it was happening, this is a very fine volume.

I have read many over the years and there are many that are quite good and have different points to recommend them.  And their critics are always able to point out their limitations and even some questionable points.<br />This translation is quite interesting in its approach to capture the pulse, feel, and literary style of the Hebrew in English.  I cannot say how effectively it was done, because I can't read Hebrew.  Many others have praised it.  I can say that it reads in a very vivid and dramatic way.  It has a lively and powerful feel to its language.  There are times it does not read as idiomatic English, but you would expect that if it were trying to capture Hebrew, right?<br />There are also many helps for the reader including introductory essays, helpful footnotes, and a great suggested reading list for further study.<br />The hard cover edition I have is very handsomely printed in easy to read type, fine paper, with some black and white illuminations to start the books.<br />I think this is wonderful addition to the shelves of English translations out there and deserves to be read by anyone interested in getting at a more aural approach to these scriptures.  This translation really does sound better being read out lout than it reads for the eye.  As I understand things, that is what the translator was after, and he succeeded.	2004-03-07

This wonderful and excellently done book is for people who want to do better.<br />I am glad that they point out it is for writers as well as editors.  This book will help students and people writing anything more than a casual note to format, punctuate, and organize their writing for better clarity and understanding.  Yes, proofreaders and editors have more use for the special markings and some of the more subtle points in the manual, but there is a lot on seemingly little things like capitals, italics, plurals, possessives, compounds, abbreviations, mathematical and scientific notation, quotations, foreign languages, tables, illustrations, footnotes, endnotes, bibliographies, indexes and more.<br />This book is compactly designed and it is very easy to find what you are looking for.

However, this is a very sound and worthy book.  It is intelligent in its choice of what it covers.  Bryan Garner doesn't wander off into esoteric weeds or theoretical debates.  Instead, he picks 700 or so practical topics and offers clear explanations and examples that help the reader understand not only what is proper usage but also why it is proper usage.<br />Some have pointed to the first two editions of Fowler, and they are apt comparisons.  I do have a copy of the most recent Fowler done by Burchfield.  Some dislike that edition.  I find it useful with caveats, however, I like this book much more.  And I use it more, which is the real test isn't it.<br />I think this is a superb book for students and for anyone who cares about what they write.  I am glad it is on my home office shelf and you also put one in easy reach.	2004-03-05

Some of the cases (business stories) it contains still inspire although some seem a bit dated, but the underlying ideas retain some power if you take time to think about them.  As the authors say in the new preface, this is a book about attributes rather than specific recommendations for action.  I like their response to those who point out that many of the companies included have since fallen on hard times.  They point out that we still learn the past accomplishments of great athletes no longer in their prime.<br />I think the best points the book makes involve the way people react under pressure in pulling back to numbers, research, and rationality in ways that won't help them.  Numbers, research, and rationality are all extremely important, but will not in themselves enable you to innovate and see new ways to compete.  Although this isn't in the book, I love the story about the driver side door for the minivans.  Chrysler stole the march on that and when one of their competitors was asked why they didn't come out with such an obvious innovation he responded that none of the customers in their focus groups asked for such a feature.  Game, set, and match for Peters and Waterman.<br />This is a book that should still be read.  It has a lot more to offer than many business books being printed today at great cost to our forests and our precious time.  This is still a keeper.	2004-03-03

He explains the current limits of our understanding.  And he has a wonderful treatment of the Domains as currently understood - Bacteria, Archae, and Eucarya.  Obviously, most of the book is on Eucarya because that is most interesting to us humans, but the bulk of life on earth is bacteria and that is kind of interesting to understand.<br />This book really updates my understanding of what I was taught in 7th grade biology too many years ago.  I think every bright high school student ought to read it as well as anyone who wants to understand the amazing range of life now living and that has lived on this earth.  You won't look at your life here the same way ever again.	2004-03-02

Alister McGrath, a Professor of Historical Theology at Oxford University, has done us a wonderful service in providing us with this lively and informative book.<br /><br />The book first provides a history starting with the medieval Church and the issues that led to the Reformation and the issues of providing the Bible in the languages of the people rather than preserving the Bible to the Priests in Latin.  The history of getting portions of the Bible in English and the connection of all subsequent translations to the Wycliffe efforts are fascinating.  Before reading this book I did not know about the Geneva Bible and its connection to the Puritans and why its marginal notes made it unacceptable to the Crown.  It was also interesting to read about the origins of printing and the huge technical feat it was to print the Bible and the deep implications mechanical printing had for society.<br /><br />Mr. McGrath also demonstrates that the King James Bible was not immediately accepted and what the language issues were that caused some of the resistance.  Its triumph wasn't complete until the Restoration during the reign of Charles II.  However, it was only in the 19th century that the KJV became \\"The Bible\\" without rival or peer.  Of course, by then the language was antiquated and it wasn't long until the movement arose for a modernized version of the KJV and this led to the idea of completely new English translations.  Today, there are so many English translations you could fill shelves of your library with them.<br /><br />I was also fascinated to read the discussion of the language used in the King James Bible and why it would have seemed strange and a touch archaic to the readers in 1611.  And I did not know that the Apocrypha was included in the original version and left out subsequently due to cost and the rejection of those books by certain branches of Protestantism.<br /><br />The book has a fascinating section that provides Psalm 23 in various English translations.  There is also a quick reference timeline and a helpful reading list and index.<br /><br />If you have any interest in the King James Bible I believe you will find this book fascinating.

Third Series (Paper))	Books	5	20	21	N	N	A fine edition with many helps for the reader	This edition is from the 3rd Arden Series and may have a more modern feel to readers than the previous series did.  For example, modern scholars believe that Shakespeare's plays were performed without break between scene and act so this edition does away with the ACT I Scene 2 headings and instead merely inserts 1.2 in the text where the change occurs.<br />There is a fine introductory essay that gives important cultural information to help the reader understand the moral climate in Venice in Shakespeare's time and the context of the play in the author's career and times.<br />This edition has the many good notes one expects from Arden editions.  The longer notes are moved to the back to avoid too great an interruption to the readability of the text.  There is also music for the two songs in the play and an index.<br />A fine edition that I am glad to own and refer to.	2004-02-24

It may seem like a bunch of breezy anecdotes told cleverly about some big name Wall Street names, and it has plenty of those, but it is much more than that.  This is a book that should be read by everyone interested in Wall Street, who has money invested there, or is thinking about putting money there, and any MBA interested in finance.  Mr. Kessler worked on Wall Street for many years as an analyst for Paine Webber and then Morgan Stanley.  Later, he left to work as a portfolio manager at Velocity Capital Management, which means he was and is still working with the same folks, but now as an investor.<br />His stories, escapades, and perspectives will lift the veil for those still innocent enough to believe that salesmen and account managers for the big trading houses have their clients' best interest at heart.  I know we learned in b-school about the Random Walk, and arbitrage theory.  All of that and the other stuff we learned is important to know.  However, more valuable are the real world insights he provides about the structural changes and unintended consequences of the Small Order Execution System and its effect on liquidity and price volatility, Sarbanes-Oxley and the closing off of information to investors, ECNs and the erosion of trading income and the change to emphasis on fees and deals to provide income, momentum investing (momos), and more.<br />I am also very glad that he does not let individual investors off the hook for their own foolishness with their retirement and investment income.  Remember, the greater fool theory cannot work without new people volunteering for the job.  In the afterword the author also briefly demonstrates why all of the popular theories for the bubble and its popping are all true and none true.  All contributed, but none we alone sufficient.  Like most disasters, the likely cause is a confluence of little events combined into something no one much caused or could stop.<br />There is an obvious comparison to Michael Lewis's wonderful \\"Liar's Poker\\" and I would recommend this book just as highly.  Mr. Kessler's career spanned a long enough time to chronicle the change from his being afraid to recommend a stock that could drop in price to Henry Blodget being afraid to downgrade a stock that could still go up in price.  An amazing journey indeed and we are the better for his having chronicled it for us in such an entertaining way.obvious comparison to Michael Lewis's wonderful \\"Liar's Poker\\" and I would recommend this book just as highly.

The strange time we went through that allowed people like Jerry Levin, Steve Case, and others to become oulandishly compensated and nearly all-powerful executives should be a cautionary tale for generations to come.  It is just weird to read how these folks worked, what they thought and believed, and how they try and justify it today.<br />The book is a lively read.  It is not a business book laden with numbers (which I would probably have enjoyed even more - but that's me).  Instead, it is a story of personalities with just enough numbers to orient the reader to the fantasy world these executives fled to.  In fact, this really couldn't have been a story told with hard numbers - because there really wasn't very much solid at the core of these valuations.<br />Ms Munk does a fine job of reporting what those involved thought and did.  She did a lot of first hand interviewing to get some of the best information.  She also provides good notes and sources for what she reports in the book.  This isn't a simple rehash of news stories, although the outlines of the story will be familiar to anyone who did follow these events in the news.<br />Personally, I found the destruction of the Time magazine morgue as a cost cutting move both horrifying and a perfect example of the cultural blindness that afflicts far to many of those who justify any behavior if they can use it to raise the stock price.  We have to demand that they attend to something more than price manipulation in their running of these great publicly held institutions.  Not through government regulation, but as shareholders, we need to make sure that these folks realize it is not okay to burn down a library full of priceless information to save a fraction of a cent per share of cost.<br />Thanks to Nina Munk!	2004-02-16

Much of that was real money invested by ordinary folks trying to make money available for their needs later in life.  (Not all of it was real money because when on person buys one share of Cisco for $100 then ALL the shares are valued at $100 even if you had purchased yours at $20 - so the $80 added to your invested funds may or may not be available when you try to sell your shares.  If they are not you didn't realize a gain, but you didn't lose your investment until the price drops below $20.)<br />I think that anyone who is invested in or is thinking about investing in equities ought to read this book.  It is written concisely and with a pretty good sense of what the responsibilities of a proper corporate management is.  That way you can look for good companies with good management and not be blinded by the hype machines in the media that are back at work today as if the past couple of years never happened.  It always amazes me that folks are investing significant sums of money into the markets having done less research than they did when they purchased their last refrigerator or car.<br />My only quibble with the book, and it isn't enough to make me less enthusiastic about recommending it strongly, is that the author tends to throw the baby out with the bath water.  He talks as if all public companies had management teams like Enron or Tyco.  It isn't true.  If he had taken a few pages and shown some management teams still doing it right I think it would have made his case stronger.  And though Mr. Lowenstein does place some blame with the investor, I think he lets them off the hook too easily.  The reason \\"The Greater Fool Theory\\" works is that far too many investors volunteer for the role of fool.<br />I do not want to let any of the bad and criminal behavior go without punishment.  However, I remember that when Yahoo was valued at over $200 BILLION dollars and, at the time, that was more than GM, Ford, and Chrysler TOGETHER.  I asked some friends who were rhapsodizing about that and other boom stocks, if they would rather have all the assets of Yahoo or all the auto companies.  They all chose Yahoo.  I pointed out that with the auto companies they would have real property, machines, buildings, and more that could all be sold.  I pointed out that personal transportation is something humans are going to always want.  Yahoo is some software that runs on some servers that could be made obsolete tomorrow.  (And notice today's power of Google which did not exist at that time.)  It made not a dent in their enthusiasm.  Such invincible ignorance deserves to be punished rather than protected.<br />Anyway, this is a fine book and has a useful index.  Read it and learn some lessons from this book more than there were some criminals running some big companies and you will be amply rewarded!member that when Yahoo was valued at over $200 BILLION dollars and, at the time, that was more than GM, Ford, and Chrysler TOGETHER.

There is no denying the great talent of Sam Waksal, but to this day he doesn't seem to understand that his talent and accomplishments do not provide a license to indulge himself at other's expense.<br />It is amazingly sad that all of this misery was so pointless because Erbitux has at last been approved.  It almost certainly could have been approved earlier if the talented team at ImClone would have had a culture of discipline and getting things done and documented in ways that everyone knew the FDA required.  If they had, all this pain and loss would never have occurred and Dr. Waksal would be a real hero instead of the one he only pretended to be.<br />Mr. Prud'homme writes with style and vitality.  The book moves along well and has a great feel for keeping the story personal and emotionally accessible for the reader.  We don't get overwhelmed with the scientific side of things, although it is always interesting to read about this emerging science and the wizards who are making it happen.	2004-02-14

In this one volume you can get a sense of the breadth and depth of the religious experience in the United States.  It is a stunning story and one that the author tells quite well.  The book is now thirty years old, so you can't expect anything after the 1960s.  From my point of view, the book is stronger in dealing with the larger and more mainstream religious viewpoints than the minority sects and religions.  While smaller, they are often not marginal and have had an impact on our culture beyond their size and yet the tone used in discussing them treats them, too often for my taste, as marginal.  The point being that if you are already in the religious mainstream faiths, this book will seem more objective to you than if you are one of the faiths outside those traditions.  However, I don't think this is so much a weakness in the book as an atmospheric you might or might not notice as your read it - depending on where you are in the religious tradition of the US.<br />This point becomes even smaller when compared to the many strengths of this book.  It is amazingly comprehensive for a single volume.  And though it is over 1,000 pages it reads easily.  It also has a fine index and can be used for reference on specific topics as well as reading from front to back.  This is a strong book and belongs on the shelf of anyone interested in the religious life of America.	2004-02-09

When I first started reading the book and the author was talking about the peaceful Japanese and the Imperialist Europeans and the American genocide of the Native Americans, I became quite worried about where the book was going.  But I stuck with it because I wanted to find out about those airmen.<br />I am glad that I did read it all the way through.  This is a terrific book!<br />Yes, there is a lot of material not directly related to the story of those airmen on Chichi Jima, but the author is doing his best to provide a good context for this effort within the broader Pacific War Effort.<br />The author writes with so much passion, so much caring that the story became personal for me as well. I don't think you have to agree with very many of his judgments to find that he has a big heart that is able to face the real pain involved in war for all participants.<br />It is not fair to say that he is letting the Japanese off the hook.  Instead, he is very clear in his anger and disgust for the Spirit Warrior ethos and his view that they were betrayers of the true Japanese traditions.  But he is clear that once America was at war it had no course but to finish it.  Given the realities that an invasion of the Japanese Homeland would involve, he also doesn't question too deeply the total war we waged.  However, he doesn't shy away from the horror and human cost it involved and he is correct, I believe.  He is also correct to point out that people who question what we did there tend to not know the true history, but that does not diminish the horrors involved in real war.<br />Mr. Bradley also points out the firebombing killed more than the atomic bombs and that Japanese swords killed more than the firebombing.<br />I am grateful for the portraits Mr. Bradley paints of these boys serving their country and the way their lives were consumed in the war.  I am also grateful for the way he follows up with the stories of the costs to the families of these soldiers.  His stories of the fate of the Japanese soldiers who served on Chichi Jima are also touching.  And while I won't reveal the last line of the book, I will tell you that it just stopped me in my tracks.  It is an incredibly powerful statement of true spiritual reconciliation.<br />Thanks for such a personal and well written book.  There are quite a few photographs that really add to the telling of the story.  But beware, some of them a very shocking.  There is also an index, good source notes, and a fine bibliography for further reading.way their lives were consumed in the war.

As you work through them you develop mental habits of analysis that help you get to the nut of the case fairly quickly so you can get prepared for class.  One of the problems is that most cases are oriented as marketing cases, or operations cases, or strategy, or finance, or organizational behavior, or accounting, or whatever cases.  A few are used by multiple disciplines, but very few integrate all the management disciplines.<br />This book is a terrific integrated case.  I enjoyed it tremendously and feel I have learned a lot from it.  What I enjoyed most was the way Mr. Gerstner demonstrated the way all the disciplines are important in leading a great corporation.  And especially the difference between the emergency room behavior he had to engage in when he first joined the company and had to start the bleeding and the different emphases he had to have in transforming IBM into an organization that could thrive in today's marketplace while remaining a great corporation.<br />I am glad to read about his emphasis on corporate culture while retaining a fierce focus on operations and backing strategy with constant, continuous analysis with hard numbers.  All fueled with passion to win.  I think this is a winning recipe.  And it is very easy to write down, but almost impossible to really execute.  Mr. Gerstner did a great job and we all owe him thanks for keeping IBM together and making it competitive once more.<br />People who are angry that the old IBM is gone shouldn't blame Mr. Gerstner.  The old IBM was dying and was going to be broken up.  Finding the right markets for the organization to compete in and remain together was a bet not many would have made.  Certainly, it is not likely that Mr. Gerstner made perfect decisions nor did the people who worked for him act with transcendent brilliance either.  The point is not perfection; it is competing effectively, actively, and with some intelligence.  Mr. Gerstner shows us how he and his team did that in the 1990s and I thank him for this great book that I encourage all students of business to read closely.e.

In this book he travels around the world looking for all things McCarthy and imbues an Irish hue to everything with a variety of brewed, distilled, and fermented beverages for flavoring.<br />While his style seems off-hand and even happenstance, it is clear he takes time to dig into the history of the places he visits and is able to use that history as a way to move his narrative along and to propel his adventures.  If you like travel writing - especially humorous travel writing - you will likely enjoy this book.  Particularly if you view the world with an Irish bent to things.  I think you will find this a fund way to spend a few hours on a fun vacation with a witty travel companion.	2004-02-03

They are: \\"America\\", \\"Europe\\", and \\"The Song of Los\\".  The last has two sections called \\"Africa\\" and \\"Asia\\" and is by far the shortest.<br />They are all beautifully illustrated and the first plate in \\"Europe\\" is probably the most famous image from Blake's illuminated works - the bearded white man kneeling and reaching down out of the sun with the measuring compass.  \\"The Song of Los\\" is also full of beautifully colored images.  The \\"America\\" plates are monochrome although a couple of colored plates are shown in the supplementary plates.<br />Since \\"America\\" has 18 plates and \\"Europe\\" 17 and \\"Los\\" 8, it follows that most of the volume's 367 pages are filled with commentary, notes, and supplementary material.  This helps a lot because these prophecies are part of Blake's rather opaque personal mythology.  Scholars have filled shelves with conjecture about what it all means and they do have some good notions, but it is tough sledding without the background material to ease the way.  This is a great edition and will be a treasure on the bookshelf of all who love the works of William Blake.	2004-02-01

But don't expect any kind of coherent development or to be able to fathom out any kind of understandable timeline.  This is Blake after all.  Most of this book is helpful introduction, commentary, notes, and supplementary materials.<br /><br />\\"The First Book of Urizen\\" is the longest of the three and the most illustrated.  It has images that are absolutely unforgettable.  They have a power and emotional impact that holds the viewer.  I have met people who find them repulsive.  I think the emotional impact makes them uncomfortable so they want to get away from the images and so push them away.<br /><br />\\"The Book of Ahania\\" and \\"The Book of Los\\" are much shorter and the illustrations are limited to the title page and the last plate (\\"The Book of Los\\" also has an illustration on the opening page of text.).  The other pages are done in particularly fine Blake script.<br /><br />As with the rest of the volumes in this series the quality of reproduction is very high and these images are delightful to study.  The scholarship is quite good and the writing is focused on opening these works up to the general reader - at least a general reader who enjoys studying Blake and is willing to put in the time it takes to fathom these rather wonderfully strange works.

They have filled to volume it commentary, notes, and helps to try and help the general reader to penetrate aspects of this extended poem / lyric / myth.  The style is so personal to Blake and so unlike any other writer's style that it is hard for most of us to make sense of what each character means in any instance.  A further difficulty is that there really isn't a narrative path or plot or much to help the reader move from one moment to the next.  Blake had a view of reality has so multi-layered with each being having simultaneous multiple identities and manifestations that our normal way of viewing reality is quite useless.<br />The plates are beautifully reproduced with wonderful coloring and great images.  It is a poem you can tackle as you wish, but plan on spending a lot of time thinking about it before it yields much to you.<br />For those readers who love Blake this is a great volume to add to your collection.	2004-02-01

The poems combined with the wonderful drawings make powerful and memorable statements that stay in your heart and mind.  Several, such as \\"The Tyger\\", \\"The Chimney Sweeper\\", and \\"London\\", are very well known.  Each of us has our own personal favorites and love turning to them again and again.<br />One of issues in buying an edition of these works is that they exist in a variety of colorings, and orders.  I would recommend this edition for several reasons. The selection of the King's College Copy is one of the most uniformly delightful or the copies Blake (or his wife) colored.  Also, the reproduction is of very high quality.  Each plate is on a right hand page with the text in print on the left hand page (in case you have problem reading the plate).  Even thought the book is in a large format, the plates are reproduced in their actual size (which is surprisingly modest).<br />There are also a dozen plates provided from other editions.  However, I would recommend that you pick up other editions based on other copies.  The variety of schemes Blake used in coloring the plates is quite interesting and, well, illuminating.<br />The second half of the book is commentary on the 54 plates of this copy.  There is an introductory essay and a list of works cited in the commentary.<br />It really is a beautiful reproduction and a joy to have on my shelf.	2004-01-29

This edition is a very fine reproduction and deserves the highest praise.  It isn't the real thing, but amazingly close for the price.  It is so good that it rewards study with a magnifying glass.  Obviously, the real gold Blake put into the original (at what must have been staggering expense for a man that was so poor there were times he couldn't afford food) doesn't duplicate its brilliant sheen, but this is pretty good.<br />Not only are there the 100 plates of copy E (the one in the Mellon collection in the British Museum at Yale), there are some sample plates from other version and all of the text in printed form with commentary.<br />This is an incredible work that is bewildering in scope in a joy to lose yourself in.  Extremely recommended if you love Blake at all.	2004-01-28

It is an extremely fast survey of philosophical thought through the millennia of human history all around the world in a broad variety of cultures.  Experts in any of the fields covered in this book will surely find their specialty too cursorily treated, but the point of the book is not the details of the points made.<br />The issue here is how human beings have wrestled with the concept of Truth throughout history.  Does it exist (it is not a modern question)?  How can you tell what is True?  How do you communicate it?  I found the author's skillful demonstration that the seemingly modern focus on private meaning and internal construction to be the resurfacing of a very old issue.<br />Proffesor Fernandez-Armesto points out that while no system ever devised can irrefutably demonstrate Truth to the satisfaction of everyone, no approach declaring the death of meaning has also been a self-contradictory system of faith.  I am a believer in the validity of an independent external reality that can be sought and, in part, known.  But whether known or not, it courses on its way with or without us.  Its reality is not subjective or open to societal interpretation.  Our interpretations of it are, but it can be demonstrated that some interpretations are better than others.  Some can land rovers on Mars and others cannot.<br />I think that this short book should be read by nearly everyone, whether you agree with its thesis or not, or the author's summaries or not.  The sheer breadth of topics in only 229 pages can provide a wonderful introduction to further study.	2004-01-28

He worked on these watercolors for the last three years of his life and died with the project incomplete.  Even though these illustrations are in varying degrees of completion, for people like me who love William Blake, each is a vast treasure and a joy to study.<br />This is fine edition that has an introductory essay by the editor, David Bindman.  This essay and all of the captions are given in English, German, and French side-by-side and on the opposite page to the reproduced watercolor.  The colors are rich and beautiful and the reproductions are clear and precise.<br />Mr. Bindman is to be applauded for the gorgeous book.  It was given to me as a gift by a very thoughtful friend to whom I am very grateful.	2004-01-26

It uses advanced mathematical techniques to discuss aspects of randomness that can be used to understand finance.  Please don't mistake it for a course to teach concepts in basic finance.<br /><br />It is a very elegant and sophisticated book for those who are very well versed in the necessary mathematics in stochastic calculus and in particular Martingale theory to show them how these tools can be applied to problems in finance.<br />If you have the math background and are interested in this topic you will get a lot from this book.

It takes you from the very basics - even who Thomas Bayes was (who happens to be buried in Bunhill Fields cemetery in London with William Blake (Songs of Innocence and Experience, Jerusalem), Daniel Defoe (Robinson Crusoe), John Bunyan (Pilgrim's Progress)).<br />Its chapters are divided into sections forming an Introduction, Foundations, Generalizations, Modeling, Inference, and Remodeling.  There is also a section summarizing the basic formulae and alternative non-Bayesian approaches.  A rich reference list, subject index, and author index are also provided.<br />If you are familiar with the math of undergraduate statistics you should not have a problem with the math notation in this book.  This really is the standard text you find on most shelves of folks who are familiar with this subject.  There are many books to read beyond this one, but this is a fine place to start.	2004-01-22

But if you have had a sound undergraduate grounding in these kinds of math skills, you should be able to get a lot out of this book.<br />The book provides worked examples to help clarify its points and there are other problems to work, but the answers are not provided anywhere in the book.

The authors demonstrate using the Venona documents declassified in 1995 that what was told by Whittaker Chambers, Elizabeth Bentley and others was the truth.  They go beyond that and show how high government officials such as Harry Hopkins tried to work the lend lease program to get Uranium for the Soviets to aid their nuclear program.<br />They also take us through the spies that were placed in the OSS (the forerunner of the CIA), and how they used their own spy network to go after dissidents outside the USSR including the murder of Leon Trotsky.  Another section talks about journalists who either supported the Soviets directly in their reporting such as I.F. Stone or were compromised by having plants on their staff such as Walter Lippmans secretary.<br />The authors also make a case the Robert Oppenheimer directly aided the Soviets.  You can weigh all this evidence for yourself.  There are many notes, and dozens of photographic reprints selected from the thousands of Venona documents.  A few of the key characters are shown in photographs.  One of my favorites is Harry Dexter Whites (a Soviet agent in the treasury) credentials for the founding conference of the United Nations signed by Alger Hiss (a Soviet agent in the State Department).<br />This book is not the only book on Venona, but it is very readable and is very direct in expressing the authors belief in what story the evidence tells us.  You are free to make up your own mind, of course.  But I think this is pretty compelling stuff.	2004-01-16

The core idea of the book is to marry cost management (management accounting) with the insights that have been developed in Corporate Strategy over the past 20 years.  What we get is a richer and more informative use of management accounting, but one that is more difficult to apply because it relies less on simple formulas and rules.<br />I like the way the book uses cases to show the additional insights you get by using their approach by comparing it to the results you would get from the case with the traditional approaches.  The authors are honest about the complications and difficulties and that helps us better assess the trade-offs.<br />This is a book that requires some background in traditional cost accounting and then after this book you will want to do more reading study and real-world analysis.  It isn't a panacea nor does it try to be.  But it sure is interesting and helpful if you care about the subject.	2004-01-15

Mr. Penenberg writes effectively and persuasively about the pain, loss, and struggle of those injured as well as the pain and struggle of their loved ones.  However, his emotional style, while effective in producing sympathetic emotions, in the end undermines the case he is trying to make.  Not that the case is necessarily wrong.  It is just that he does not really prove it beyond an emotional conviction.<br /><br />He does not use his journalistic detachment to let both sides speak and let the preponderance of the evidence fall where it may.  The author wants to convince us that Ford is wrong (and I am not saying they are or aren't) and that the lawyers are good.  A couple of examples about the lawyers:  Early in the book he introduces Tab Turner has having a private jet, but not a flashy one - the author calls it a Plymouth with wings.  A few pages later he reveals it to be a Cessna Citation.  This is a very nice jet and Turner is a very very rich man who for all his protestations of not caring about fees gathers them by the truckload.  And it isn't until the second half of the book that we are shown the fighting over fees and the skullduggery in getting the client to unwittingly sign a new contingency fee arrangement without her healthy caregivers around.  It is sickening.<br /><br />But we all love our own lawyers when they help and protect us (as we should), and we think the other guy's lawyers are scum (unless they lose).  That is the way it goes.  And friends eventually become targets of suits in the name of justice.  Again, it is hard to take, but it happens.<br /><br />I believe that the book would have been stronger if he would have actually presented both sides of this issue fairly and completely.  While the emotions of the case would then be a bit more confused, the reader would be better equipped to make a fair and clearer judgment about the case rather than the one the author wants you to make.<br /><br />We all despise corporate decisions that expose people to death and injury to save a few dollars or because of carelessness and callous disregard.  But we also despise attorneys making huge fees from tragically injured clients and stepping on endless numbers of people, justice, and truth to claim those fees.  It isn't that this is a bad book.  Rather, it could have been stronger by being more objective.  Almost certainly, Ford and Firestone would not have been very forthcoming for interviews.  However, when I was reading I kept hoping for more complete information about the accidents from multiple perspectives.  The book is worth reading if you are interested in this story, but I could have used less direction from the author on how I was supposed to feel and more information about the facts - not just the defense lawyers' arguments.ake.

They were wonderfully illustrated with drawings, pictures, and questions about space, the future, the past, and the unknown.  They fascinated me and allowed me to begin thinking about important areas of human understanding without having much of it myself.<br />Dr. Stephen Hawking had a huge unexpected hit with his \\"Brief History of Time\\", which I, and millions of others, loved.  He came out with an illustrated version, which many of us also purchased.  This book covers different subjects in the same topic of cosmology.<br />I think it is a wonderful book that can capture the imagination of inquisitive young people.  It is written engagingly without being condescending.  It takes its reader seriously while finding ways to explain topics in a non-technical way that otherwise could be mind numbingly opaque.  He even brings in time travel and even Star Trek as a means of discussing certain limitations of our understanding of the universe.<br />Just as the books I read as a young man became outdated by brilliant minds like Dr. Hawking's this one will as well.  However, it can serve a great mind opening purpose for young people and interested adults.  It is not very long, but can spark a lot of thinking and discussion between friends interested in physics and cosmology.  If you are looking for a gift for a bright teenager who likes these topics, this would be a good choice.	2004-01-11

This volume documents Soviet activities in the US from the Soviet side of the events.  It contains 95 documents that demonstrate conclusively the USSR involvement in American communism and the CPUSA.  This includes documents 43, 44, 45, 46 which are a letter from Gus Hall (longtime leader of the CPUSA and their perennial presidential candidate) pleading for financial support, and drafts (with photographic reproductions of the notes and Mr. Hall's signature) of his receipt of $2 million and $3 million in the 1980s.<br />The evidence indicates that there was much more Moscow Gold spread around to finance American communism and that there was little of it not affected in some way by financial support from the USSR.<br />The book is not a comprehensive discussion of American communism, but a presentation of certain documentary evidence.  However, it is very revealing.  This isn't to take away from the sincerity of those who believe, for whatever reasons, in communism.  But it does prove the lies that were told for decades about the independence of the CPUSA were indeed lies.<br />A very valuable volume.  It also has a glossary of names and organizations with brief bio info, an appendix of American and Soviet Cominternists, and an index.	2004-01-10

It isn't for mathematical beginners, but it isn't opaque either.  It requires a student to think, experiment and to learn by puzzling things out in one's mind rather than simple memorization and regurgitation.  Nor does it follow the all too common modern method of over simplifying things to allow people to pretend they have learned math while only dabbling in a few basic topics.<br />This book is amply illustrated with many exercises (answers are provided at the back for all the exercises).  The book also has some humor and wit with the quotes it distributes throughout the book to help liven things up.<br />There is also a list of helpful references and an index.  When reading the book, don't be afraid of going to a dictionary or the web or some other math books for clarification of some terms or more basic concepts.  It is essential to have everything clear in your mind before moving on or you will stumble.  As in all math, it is like a building with the next stage being built on the present one which is built on the previous one.  You can't skip steps very successfully very often.<br />This is a great volume to have in your library, but even better to work through.	2004-01-10

The 92 documents provided in this book demonstrate clearly the way that American communism was used by the Soviet Union as a base of intelligence gathering. This is not to say that every American communist was disloyal, but that the funding and organization was provided from Moscow for purposes far from merely ideological.<br />There is also a very good discussion of the Soviet involvement in the American and Canadian brigades that went to the Spanish Civil War (there is another great volume in this series specifically on this, by the way).  And more background on Elizabeth Bently, the Perlo Group and the early funding of early American communists such as John Reed (who received more than a million dollars).<br />There is only a bit here on Venona, Hiss, Greenglass, and the Rosenbergs, however.  Although what is here is mostly summary material.  There are other volumes you can turn to for more comprehensive and concrete discussions of these topics.  This book does state their guilt with the view that Ethel Rosenberg was used as a wedge against Julius and called the government's bluff.<br />It is a very fine volume that I am glad to have in my library.  There are two appendices:  the first on the archival record and the second on the organization of the American Communist Party.  There is also a list of selected readings and an index.	2004-01-10

Mr. Roberts does a very good job of telling the story of David Greenglass, his wife Ruth, and his sister and brother-in-law, Ethel and Julius Rosenberg.  The Rosenbergs were executed the year before I was born and it is a sad story I have heard various versions of throughout my life.  Depending on your political leanings it became a kind of vision test.  What you saw in it revealed a lot about how you saw the world and what you believed about the Cold War.<br />Mr. Roberts gives a lot of background material to provide context and to help modern-day readers capture more of the atmosphere of the time.  One example that affected me was the link many made between the onset of the Korean War with Stalin having atomic weapons sooner than he would have without Fuchs, Greenglass, and the Rosenbergs.  (Ted Hall played a significant role as well, but no one outside the Intelligence community knew about him until the 1990s.)<br />The author provides unequivocal evidence of Julius acting as an agent and spy for the Soviet Union.  He also has no doubt that Ethel was aware of and approved of her husband aiding the USSR.  They were naively supporting an ideal politics that did not exist.  Julius also seemed to enjoy the importance he felt he attained by doing this work.  He also seems to have provided other technologies to the Soviet Union including a proximity fuse.<br />But Roberts expresses grave concern over even charging Ethel and provides evidence that she was being used as a lever on her husband.  Mr. Roberts seems to doubt that there was enough real evidence to even indict Ethel let alone convict and execute her (actual guilt being a different issue).  There is no doubt that everyone involved wished that Julius would cooperate so their sentences could be commuted.  But Julius and Ethel were committed to their ideology more than their own lives.<br />The bombshell in this book is provided in the summary of a series of interviews that Roberts had with David Greenglass (now living under a different name) wherein Greenglass says that he did say things on the stand that weren't exactly correct.  He did not see the photographic table he testified to (although he knew that Julius did do photographic spy work), and, more explosively, that he had no personal recollection of the famous scene of Ethel typing the pages of atomic bomb notes.  He testified to it to corroborate his wife, Ruth's. testimony.  Greenglass, however, confirms and says that he has no doubt of Julius and Ethel's guilt.  He also says he was shocked when they received the death penalty.<br />This is a story that seems to have no resolution.  Those who remember it tend to be very committed to one version or another.  For the rest, it is an old event that is evaporating from memory with only vague notions of what was at stake and without historical context.  Mr. Roberts has done us all a great service by getting the real story with wonderful detail and good analysis.  If you are interested in this story, this book is a must read.

It is not a comprehensive history of the United States as told by Stephen Ambrose and Douglass Brinkley.  Rather, it is a collection of 170 articles or vignettes on different, mostly well-known, events in American History.  These articles are writings contemporaneous with the events described.<br /><br />There are also many illustrations and photographs and a really interesting audio CD with a number of selections dramatically recreated and some of them audio with the actual participants.<br /><br />Stephen Ambrose and Douglass Brinkley have based their text on previous edition done by Henry Steele Commager and Allan Nevins.  Because these are selections and usually only one perspective is given of each event (editors always have to balance sweep and perspective with limited space), the viewpoints presented may differ with your own.  However, I find the value of contemporary perspective quite valuable - especially in teaching my children.  I can balance any bias I see with other books and by delving more deeply into the event described.  But these articles make a great jumping off point.<br /><br />There is a bibliography providing the sources of each article, but there is not an index.  Because of the nature of this book, the table of contents and the bibliography are probably enough.	2004-01-03

A critic's role is to spark your own thinking and investigation, to encourage us to formulate our own views and develop our arguments for them more explicitly.  Letting a critic supply you with your views or to simply reject him because he doesn't confirm your pre-dispositions is a waste of your own reading time as well as the work the critic put into to his work.<br />Rejecting a critic's views is fine, if you do it with well-formed argument and facts or for explicit aesthetic views and tastes.  The whole purpose of affirmation includes the idea of rejection. Just as accepting everything is to accept nothing, making choices on acceptance includes the statement, &quot;No, not this.&quot;<br />Robert Hughes has strong views and has the talent for stating them forcefully.  Whether or not you agree with him is almost beside the point.  This book is a wonderful tour of American Art from Colonial times through the mid 1990s.<br />While I don't want to try and state Mr. Hughes' views for him, my reading of this book tells me that when architecture, painting, and sculpture comes from an artist honestly trying to come to grips with his or her views of the world and our living in it, Mr. Hughes considers that a good thing.  Whenever that is compromised in favor of social acceptance or whenever an artistic establishment forms to enforce an orthodoxy and muzzle expression he considers that a bad thing.<br />He also tends to favor actual skill, facility, and even virtuosity in expression (if not necessarily technique) over posing and demanding acceptance.  The artist must be able to communicate to others and win an audience and hold them over time to win the author's admiration.  Influencing others and having resonance with other artists and other times is also a plus.<br />The sorry state of art in our time with the dominance of a self-reinforcing elite art establishment in the museums, the shows, and the galleries comes in for a heavy beating later in the book.  It isn't a blanket rejection of current art, rather it is a large pin the balloon of recent pretension and I think this is very valuable.<br />I see this in the book and hope I am saying this correctly in part because I agree with this view. Not every conclusion Mr. Hughes makes is one I find myself endorsing, but as I say, that is beside the point.  He has mastered a lot of information, presents us with hundreds of wonderful works to consider, and challenges us to think for ourselves about the issues he raises.  I think this is a wonderful service and that this is a wonderful book.  I am glad to have it on my shelf to dip into again and again.elite art establishment in the museums, the shows, and the galleries comes in for a heavy beating later in the book.

It is vivid, has blood & murder, magic, visions, treachery, and just deserts.  I mean, what is not to love?  The play moves along quickly and isn't one of the longer plays.  For all these reasons and more, audiences love it.<br />But there is a lot more to the play than the plot outline might suggest.  Shakespeare brilliantly works out the subtleties of character through the action, interactions, and self-discussions in the play.  It isn't a simple \\"action\\" play, it is also a masterwork of revealing the character of the characters even when they are themselves unaware of the trap they are leaping into.<br />I am partial to the Arden editions because I trust the text, love the extensive notes, and the introductory and additional material that helps give the play context and talks about sources Shakespeare almost certainly used.  In this case Holinshed's \\"Chronicles of Scotland\\".  Throughout this edition there are also discussions of the textural problems of this play: where some things seem to be missing, what might be interpolations, and so forth.<br />This is a very useful edition of a great play.	2004-01-02

One really nice feature of the articles is that there are marginal listings of the plates and figures discussed in each paragraph so it is easy to find text related to the images in which you are interested.<br />There are two volumes and over 1,300 pages.  Volume 1 begins with a brief essay on Florence's prelude to greatness (59 B.C. 0 A.D. 1200). Then the book is organized into sections of varying size: Civic Price and Prosperity (1200 - 1340),  An Age of Crisis (1340-1400), Images of a Free Republic (The Early 15th Century), and The Era of Cosimo De' Medici (1430-69).  Volume two has: Lorenzo Il Magnifico (1469-92), The End of the Republic (1492-1530, and ends with The Medicean Principate (1530 - c. 1600).  Each of these larger sections is organized in the same way - Architecture, then sculpture, and then painting. It is quite fascinating to watch how tastes and techniques evolve over the centuries.<br />There is also a glossary, bibliography, a section on the photographer and authors, an index and photo credits.<br />This isn't a book you will likely read from beginning to end. It is almost an ocean you will want to spend time exploring for years in order to take in all that it has to offer.  It is almost impossible to not take away something new every time you open its magnificent pages.  This is a real treasure for your library.  I know is one in mine.is one in mine.	2004-01-01

Certainly one could debate what has been left out and why what is included here was chosen over some other verse, but there is a lot of beauty included here.  For me, it is a wonderful place to visit again and again to dip into this and that and to notice things I hadn't seen before.<br />I think that getting focused on what isn't in this collection is to cheat yourself of the beauty that is here.  Not every work is to my taste, not every work is even what I think of as good, but the range and scope of works included is really wonderful.  There are many works of great beauty and more of great worth.  I think it is a fine collection.<br />One of the nice things I have found is that something I didn't at first find attractive opened up to me after repeated visits.  The breadth of the music created with our language is stunning to me and has given me a great deal of pleasure.<br />There are 822 works in this collection that are arranged chronologically from the 13th century through the mid 1990s and grouped by poet.  There is an index by author, by foreign authors in translation or imitation, and an index of works by first line.  This organization makes it very easy to find a work that you might be looking for or to decide where to dip into the pool depending on how you feel at the moment.	2003-12-29

This past year I decided, for a number of reasons, to do it myself.  I bought a nice mower, a fertilizer spreader, and this book.  The information contained in this book was extremely helpful to a novice like me.  I also followed the program set forth by the fertilizer manufacturer I chose and mowed and watered according to the advice set forth in this book.<br />Frankly, I was shocked by how quickly my lawn improved.  You have to understand that my lawn was basically dead and full of weeds.  It seemed like it was mostly weeds.  But getting the lawn mowed properly, with some good fertilizer and weed control and sufficient water creates amazing results.<br />This book helped me understand different grass types, weed varieties and how to treat them, how to select fertilizers and how much to apply based upon grass type, how much work you want to put into your lawn, and soil types.  Your lawn can take as much work as you want to put into it, but the minimum amount can be pretty low.  I probably picked a medium amount because of all the recovery I had to accomplish.  My neighbors routinely complimented the lawn and by the end of the season it wasn't much work at all.<br />This book is concise, well illustrated, and very informative.  It sure helped me and I believe that if you are a beginner like me, it can be of great help to you.	2003-12-27

Of course, Mr. Woodward played a significant role in reporting Watergate and has written extensively about the Presidency since then.<br />This book examines the various difficulties and scandals the Presidents since Nixon have had and the shadow the legacy of Watergate fell on those events and affected how they were handled and perceived.  The most significant event in the way these things played out was the creation of the Independent Counsel.  While I was never wild about the Independent Counsels before I read this book, I have come to the conclusion that it was an awful idea and an abuse of our Constitution.  While the office was designed to not be accountable to the President to afford a credible ability to investigate the Executive Branch, it has no reasonable boundaries or limits and is not subject to any of the checks or balances that enable our government to function as reasonably as it does.<br />Freed from any limits of time, budget, or public accountability it is not surprising that many, but not all, of these Independent Counsels end up pursuing all kinds of things apart from what they were originally charged to pursue.  My chief conclusion from reading this book is that this was a bad law with worse execution and should never be revived.  Good riddance!<br />Half of the book is devoted to the Clinton scandals.  The other large section is Iran-Contra.  How you perceive Woodward's balance and objectivity will be colored by your personal politics.  I have to admit that I found my own reading of the book varied at different points because of my own view of these scandals and whether or not I agreed with Woodward or felt that his own political biases were creeping in (which is impossible to avoid).  But all-in-all there is a lot of good reporting here and is written in way that is easy to read.  There are lots of endnotes to document the sources for the various statements, meetings, and conclusions drawn.<br />I recommend the book highly.tatements, meetings, and conclusions drawn.  <br />I recommend the book highly.	2003-12-25

Dr. Edell seeks to give sound medical advice in a commonsense manner that is based on science rather than anecdote or wish.<br />2) The style of the book is in a tried and true question and answer format.  The questions are relevant to people's present concerns and the answers are to the point, clear, and at times quite witty which adds to the enjoyment of reading the book.  There are also little side boxes throughout the book that bust various myths or provide quick insights into topics in the popular media.<br />3) It is organized in sections that make finding what you are interested in reading about easy to find.<br />4) The book is loaded with websites and places to go for further sound information on various topics.<br />I am a person that thinks most of what is written about health should be shredded and recycled as soon as possible and preferably not printed in the first place.  However, this is a terrific book that I would gladly hand to anyone looking to read about any of the topics it includes.  You will have to make your own conclusions about the advice Dr. Edell gives, but I found this book to be useful and convincing.	2003-12-25

It is an interpretive essay rather than an academic or formal biography.  Since the author is basing this book on secondary sources, he carefully lists all the sources he relied on to write this book,  He doesn't claim to provide original research or to have had access to primary sources that aren't publicly available.  But it is good for a quick read and introduction to the Thomas Watson Sr and Jr.<br />Since business is done by actual human beings, I enjoy peeling back the corporate veneer and the impersonal language of saying the company did this or that and looking at the real people and what they did with a touch of why they made their choices if such evidence is available.  Not for the soap opera or supposition of it, but to learn real lessons about the character, the luck, the blunders, the brilliance that makes up all of the stories of history.  One of the phony things corporations do in misusing the language is to say things like ABC Giantcorp made the decision to do XYZ.  Actually, the men and women who run the organization made that decision.  The Watsons both knew this and were, by today's standards, surprisingly human (if hard driving).<br />Watson Sr. was a special character who came out of that early period of the first vast American corporations.  He learned the right lessons and had the right traits.  He found the right opportunity in building what he turned into IBM.  Watson Jr. turned into a special character partly from the training from his father, but more by his experiences in WWII.  But like a great many families of men of vast ambition and ability, the family of Watson Sr. did not get all the benefits of wealth and experience without cost.  There was a lot to live up to and, for the most part, they met their responsibilities (with some all-too-normal failings).  All in all, the author tells a cautionary tale.<br />The book is well documented.  There is a list of the sources used for each chapter, a bibliographical essay with a good list of the sources you can use for more reading on the Watsons an IBM and a good index.<br />I will say that the author's informal writing style, especially when he flips into the first person, can be disorienting.  Yes, he has a breezy style that reads like a class lecture sounds, but at times it caused me to stop and have to parse the language to figure out exactly whom he was talking about and what he was saying.  There were a couple of times that I had to make surmises and am still not absolutely sure that the meaning I finally took away was what the author intended.<br />But it is really a pretty good and valuable book.s well documented.

A home run.  While I am not an industry insider, I did read it while I was getting an MBA from the Michigan Business School and enjoyed it a great deal.  It provided a great deal of background to what I was learning in various finance classes.  Mr. Lewis helped me see the people who make these markets work and move and that it isn't faceless formulas free of emotion finding perfect prices; rather it is ambitious men (and women) ferociously and sometimes crazily pursuing their own financial interests.<br />The book is amazingly funny without being slapstick.  There are some amazing images - not only the Meriwether games of Liar's Poker, but the food being delivered to the physically rotund mortgage bond traders, the bond trader who felt like the price would rise and then kept buying billions of dollars in bonds to prove himself right.  I loved reading about the training he received and what he was taught about selling bonds and how those folks really do view their customers.  Some of the institutional stuff is a bit dated (but still valuable as history), but the human stuff still rings fresh and true because people and still, well, whatever it was they were back then.<br />If you just want an entertaining read - read this book.  If you want to read about the early go-go years in the bond trading and the pre-boom boom years on Wall Street - read this book.  If you want to learn about some of the big names in finance and what they did - read this book.  You get the idea.  I am saying you should read this book and you will be glad you did.

It is a book full of witty sayings of and anecdotes about our Presidents.  He has grouped the Presidents from the wittiest descending to the point of having good stories about those Presidents that weren't particularly funny.  Mr. Dole even provides his own ranking of the Presidents as wits from #1 - Lincoln down to #41 - poor Millard Fillmore.<br />These stories and witty sayings are generally quite good.  Some you will want to remember. He even has a last section on George W. Bush and Al Gore.  You will remember some of these from your own reading of the news and watching Letterman and Leno.<br />What I like about these little stories is the human touch they add to the too often formal and impersonal view we have of our Presidents.  We see their pictures, memorize a couple of dates and maybe some key legislation or war during their time in office and that will be it.  We seldom get to know them as people.  These stories, in just a few sentences, show their character and view of themselves, their time, and the world in which they lived.  Sure, too much can be made of them.  But they do add something useful and a chuckle or two never hurt anyone's day.<br />This is a bit larger volume than the first book, but it doesn't read long.  And, like the first one, it is fun to just dip into now and again.	2003-12-08

Two of those obligations involve financial statements.  First is to report an accurate picture of the financial state of the firm - which argues for conservative accounting.  Second is to maximize the share price - which argues for more aggressive accounting because higher reported earnings tend to produce higher share prices.  These contrary pressures create differnt outcomes in different firms and investors need to be aware at what is happening at their firm.<br />This wonderfully informative book shows us how to understand financial reporting so we can determine if a given company is using conservative, aggressive, or even fraudulent accounting. I found it fun to read about the cases of shenanigans and how they were perpetrated and exposed.  I also found it informative to learn about the gradations of shenanigans from aggressive reporting to outright fraud.<br />It seems to me that most people who want to put their hard earned savings into equity investments would do well to educate themselves at least a little to the potential pitfalls that occur when a management team is willing to break their trust with investors. It has been pointed out by others that many folks put more time and analysis into buying a refrigerator or a lawnmower than in their retirement investments.  When you think about it that way, the misplaced priorities of some investors become clear.<br />Dr. Schilit has a lively writing style that keeps things from bogging down.  This book isn't a hard read and can help the average investor understand more about what companies can and have done to basically phony up what they report to investors.  Much of it is NOT illegal, but aggressive corporate behavior and reporting has too often led to disaster for investors. If you can clearly see which companies use aggressive accounting and which are conservative, you can better decide if you want to take on the risk associated with the aggressive accounting and the management style it represents. Maybe it is worth it, maybe it isn't, but at least you can decide for yourself rather than being in the dark.<br />The author takes us through seven shenanigans that show up over and over again and more than two-dozen techniques that have been used to accomplish them. Many of the examples included are from well-known companies you may be doing business with today. He also has some helpful information on how to do vertical and horizontal analysis of financial statements in order to find the early warning signs that something might be amiss. The book culminates in an extended analysis of the financials of a famous case of Shenanigans: Miniscribe - the late maker of hard drives.<br />And if you don't know anything about reading financial statements, there is a very helpful appendix giving you the basics of reading them and what they can and cannot help you see.<br />Dr. Schilit also provides a list of online resources (only one of which is his own) that can help you do research on potential investments. He also provides key phrases (indicating danger) to search for in annual reports.<br />No, this book will not make you a forensic accountant. But, yes, you will be more informed after having read it and that will help you make more informed decisions. Of course you can still make bad investment decisions, but they will likely have somewhat more reasoning behind them and maybe you can make fewer of them.<br />I personally agree with the author that being aware of aggressive accounting practices is a kind of early warning system for the more serious problems that follow on all too often and always at shareholder expense. This book is worth the investment of your dollars and time in order to avoid the kinds of losses associated with companies that choose to misrepresent their actual financial condition to their shareholders. Note the headlines recently about Royal Dutch Shell Oil and its accounting reserves and earnings.<br />The book does have a couple of minor typos, but they don't change the story much. They are usually easy to see and to adjust for in your reading of the example at hand. Yes, it would have been nice to not have them and I hope they catch them in a future printing. There is also a very useful index.<br />Overall, a valuable book and a very fine job!<br />It seems as if the positive reviews on this book are being given negative votes out of disagreement with liking the book rather than the review itself.

Bob Dole has a fine sense of humor and has selected witty sayings by politicians on a variety of topics in a range of situations.  Senator Dole has organized them topically and I found all of them funny and many of them hilarious.  A few are even worth committing to memory.<br />It isn't a long book, but it offers a lot of great stories.  What is even better is that Mr. Dole shares his own knowledge of some of the people he quotes in the book and of the institutions in Washington that he knows so well.  It is a book you can enjoy reading from front to back or just dipping into briefly again and again.<br />A word to speakers who would use the anecdotes from this book: be careful.  I remember when this book first came out and politicians everywhere were quoting this or that story from it and it was a bit embarrassing to hear.  This kind of humor is something that has to be used with a delicate touch and with the best style and timing.  You can't just say the words and expect the big laugh.  It just doesn't work that way.  I always enjoyed Senator Dole's sense of humor and he could pull it off with a bit of an acerbic touch.  Some folks didn't like that spice, but I always did.	2003-12-07

It is full of great illustrations and photographs to accompany the clear and concise text about the many aspects of the human body.  The book starts with the single cell and the types of cells that make up our bodies.  It then tackles each of the various structures in twelve chapters in a quite logical way.  We are shown the skeletal system, muscular, nervous, endocrine, cardiovascular, immune, respiratory, digestive, urinary, and reproductive systems with a final chapter on the human life cycle.<br />It is a great help to a parent who wants to illustrate a simple point to a child.  For example, I wanted to show my son why brushing a flossing teeth are important.  I turned to page 157 and was able to show him how left over food and bacteria can infect the gums and how that can damage teeth.  He was able to see how cavities cause problems. He discovered on his own that the nasal cavity is connected to the mouth as he suspected.<br />You can do the same thing with every system of the body.  I have found this a resource to turn to again and again.<br />There is also a glossary with some nice illustrations and a good index.	2003-12-02

Though there is a lot of sadness in the book, I found it to be a wonderful read.  To hear an Indian voice and to learn about those cultural sensibilities is like taking an exotic trip.  Not as a tourist, but into the apartments of real human beings in an apartment building in Bombay.  The Vishnu of the title is an alcoholic who does odd jobs for a bit of money and food.  He lives on a landing and as the book opens he lies dying there.  It is strange for an American to think about people walking around a dying person and debating what to do with him.  To even work up enough emotion to call an ambulance, but then to not take him away because no one wants to sign for the hospital bill is foreign to us.  I have no idea if this is the way it is in India, but why would you make it up if it were not?<br />There book involves the interactions of some of the tenants in the building and their all too ordinary lives with their hopes and dreams.  There are religious visions in the book and the tensions between Hindus and Muslims also plays a role.  I particularly love the way the Romeo and Juliet story between Salim and Kavita plays out without an overly dramatic or noble resolution.  Kavita's subsequent dream is true to her character and what led to all the hubbub in the first place.<br />The way the ordinary and the petty is juxtaposed with the mythical is handled very well.  The author does show how religion can be a living presence that brings life, light, and hope. But he also shows the way it is demeaned and used as cover for petty and vindictive behavior.  Mr. Suri can write.  His characters come across as real people and I look forward to reading more of his work.	2003-11-29

That book had a huge impact on the national dialogue on the media and there have been many responses to Mr. Goldberg's first book.  This book is his recounting of the reaction he faced in talking about &quot;Bias&quot; around the country.  It also includes new material and examples of the way many in the mainstream media still don't grasp the way they bias their reporting.  The author says many times that it is not a conspiracy, but a result of a kind of blinkered view of the world that many of that culture share because they only talk to each other.  My suspicion is that this book will be more widely read by those who already agree with the author than by those who reject the thesis he presented in &quot;Bias&quot;.  In other words, those who would benefit the most by reading it won't.  But isn't that they way of the world?<br />I enjoyed this book and found some interesting and fun stuff.  While I believe &quot;Bias&quot; to be required reading for anyone who wants to talk about the media, this book is a good way to flesh out the discussion about that book and the responses to it.  It is not a repetition of the same material.  By the nature of what it discusses there will be a certain similarity.  But here he spends more time talking about and provides examples of the flat rejection of his first book's thesis by the media elite.  He has a great interview with the wonderful Tim Russert, and he even provides 12 steps for media types who want to provide a more balanced reporting style regardless of their personal views.  I found the step on expanding your Rolodex quite useful.<br />The book doesn't take long to read and is written the way Mr. Goldberg talks.  There is a good index.  If you are interested in this national discussion, this is a very good contribution to the ongoing debate and worth a few hours of your time.	2003-11-25

It is visually stunning.  I enjoy looking at it over and over again.  And his writing invites us to further consideration and continue our explorations of this art in other books.<br />Art of many eras and styles is included so we can springboard from here into almost any branch of the Western artistic tradition.  The book helps us expand our view and to explore beyond what we personally find familiar and comfortable.<br />Books with superlatives in the title encourage us to disagree and to challenge.  All the better!  It forces us to look more deeply and to formulate why we believe this way or why our tastes run that way.  By looking and considering our views more deeply we become better students and are better prepared to explore into new forms and unfamiliar modes.<br />Some of the things in here I really love, some of I have seen in person, and some, like Rauschenberg's \\"Bed\\" I still dislike.  Oh, well, my loss, I guess.  But even in disliking it I am glad that I had it to consider and think about.  I am better off for this and am grateful to Mr. Hoving.<br />It really is a very beautiful book.	2003-11-15

While Stalin murdered millions of innocent people who were unlucky enough to have been citizens under his rule, this book tells of the way this evil regime turned on fifteen people whose crime was being Jewish and wanting to examine the Nazi atrocities in the portions of the USSR they occupied.<br />It is a particularly poignant telling because the authors provide us with excerpts from the transcripts of the trial so you hear the victims and their accusers in their own words.  These people were destroyed by the system they tried to serve and help largely because Stalin decided to use the Jews and the fear of paranoid Zionist conspiracies as the Nazis had done.<br />This is a very valuable book and I am glad it is in print.  As part of the Annals of Communism series it provides important and permanent testimony of the criminality of the USSR that had been lied about and hidden for too long.<br />Thanks to the authors.	2003-11-15

He has read more than even an avid reader would find possible in a couple of lifetimes.  This makes it very easy for us to find things of value to learn from his writing and thinking about literature.  At least it does for me.<br />Bloom has such passion and love for prose and poetry that it infects me and I find his bold pronouncements an invitation to question and my own conclusion and preconceptions.  Of course, Bloom wouldn't expect you to agree with him simply because he said it.  He would invite challenge and argument, but be prepared in your challenges!<br />This is a collection of forty-one stories and eighty-three poems that Bloom particularly loves and considers wonderful foundational reading.  As he says, he does not believe in children's literature and these pieces wouldn't be found in most contemporary public primary school readings.  But the poems are mostly short enough that a younger reader could go over them enough times to begin possessing them by heart in your memory.  This is not a process of rote memorization, but of taking a kind of ownership through bonding with the material.<br />What a great body of material Prof. Bloom has given us here.  It is a bound series or riches offered as a gift for us to return to again and again and draw from throughout our life.<br />Thanks, Prof. Bloom!	2003-11-15

I can't praise this series enough for the service they have provided us in every one of these volumes.<br />This book provides, in English translation, 81 important documents of the true Soviet actions in its participation in the Spanish Civil War.  Historians will have to make the final judgments and assessments of this material.  But I am glad to have the myth of the idealistic Soviet exposed for the lie it always was.<br />Just as an example of what we learn, we now understand Stalin's desire and success at basically stealing the $50,000,000 Spain had in gold reserves. by shipping Spain outdated and non-functioning military junk as arms.  We also know that the French, in effect, supported the Nazi's by interdicting other Soviet arms shipments to the Republic.<br />There is much more valuable information between the covers of this wonderful book.  It reads shorter than its five-hundred plus pages because the documents can be read quickly and the commentary on them is completely fascinating.	2003-11-15

The images provided are simply exquisite and well chosen.  It is impossible for me to flip to a page and not learn or see something new even after owning this book and looking at it for several years.  There is just so much here that even as your eyes become familiar with it, you begin to see more deeply into it.<br />The authors show us how the writing developed, matured, and how the scribal tradition passed away.  They also show us how western scholars tried to deal with this writing before the great decipherment happened in the second half of the twentieth century.<br />Yes, this can make a gorgeous coffee table book and can spark much discussion, but unlike books found on such tables, this one deserves to be read closely and multiple times.  It is a book I treasure deeply.	2003-11-15

The criminal nature of the Soviet Union can no longer be explained away as a corruption by Stalin of the pure and noble ideology of Lenin.  The documents provided here clearly demonstrate Lenin's criminality and his role in building the terror state that was the USSR.<br />Dr. Richard Pipes, a great scholar on Soviet history, has done a great service for us in putting this material together so concisely and powerfully.  It is another important volume in the Annals of Communism series that I cannot praise enough.<br />Dr. Pipes provides an introduction and a biographical sketch of Lenin, a few pictures, commentary on the importance of each document.  The documents themselves are often excerpts while many are presented in full translation.  There are a couple of them also provided in the original by a photograph of the actual document.<br />This is a vital book in understanding the origins of the Soviet Union and the nature of the relationships among the founders of what led to so many horrors and so many deaths.	2003-11-15

He has written at length on the origin and events of the revolution that led to the founding of the USSR.  Only someone with his deep knowledge of the material and his skill at writing could pull off such a brilliant telling of these important, and tragic, historical events in only 400 pages.<br />The book is divided into three sections. The first is called &quot;The Agony of the Old Regime&quot; and provides a snapshot of the way Russia was governed and the lives of its citizens and peasants in 1900.  It also discusses its experiments in constitutional government and the crisis of the First World War and the February Revolution.<br />The second part is entitled &quot;The Bolsheviks Conquer Russia&quot; and tells us about Lenin, the October Coup, and the building of the terror state.<br />Part three is called &quot;Russia under the Bolshevik Regime&quot; and discusses the Civil War, the building of the mechanisms to export communism and revolution to the rest of the world, the crisis of Lenin's stroke and the positioning for power by Stalin and then Lenin's death.  The chapter on &quot;Reflections on the Russian Revolution is very valuable.  There is a list of suggested further readings and the book has many well-chosen pictures.	2003-11-15

However, several of my friends from the Michigan Business School who are from China believe them to be true and that is good enough for me.  A few of them were actually in the square in the days leading up to the final horror.  Plus, we all know from the history of the Pentagon Papers and similar events, that documentation of difficult historical events do have a way of finding their way to the light.<br />While there are narratives of these events that are easier to read than this long and somewhat disconnected book, there is a real power that comes with reading the actual documents.  Plus, it fills in some of the gaps and provides deeper background for those commentaries.  The notes provided by the authors to fill in the gaps is pretty good and reads like it is true, but, again, I have no way of knowing.<br />There are a few maps and the front of the book and 100 short biographies (a few lines each) at the back to help us keep track of who is who.  But there are no pictures provided.  There is a small index.	2003-11-15

The style and pose of the book is such that if you praise it you are derided as a fool and if you express dislike it you are vilified as a flack for the vast media conspiracy or at least a naive phoole.  Maybe what can be safely said is that if you like your gossip bilious, splenetic, and snarky, well, this is the book for you.  It is hard to look away when someone has a powerful figure in his headlights and is driving them down at a high rate of speed.  The act is so fascinatingly horrible that we just watch it happen no matter the guilt we feel for even tangentially being a part of such violence.<br />What you will find interesting in this book depends on your threshold of what you count as analysis.  My own view is that the book is actually very light on serious insight.  When Wolff passes judgment there is never supporting evidence beyond an anecdote or light witticism.  There is a lot of stating, after the fact, what &quot;everyone new at the time&quot; when in fact few if any did.  To Wolff almost everyone is a fool, a crook, or worse.  Even his compliments have to be left-handed and include at least a back handed slap and an anticipatory retraction.  He congratulates himself too much for minor accomplishments.  He seems to think that saying merely outrageous things that draw sporadic and spasmodic approval he is somehow a serious analyst rather than a blind squirrel gathering an occasional nut.<br />And for someone who postures as one of the true insiders (note how proud he is in being invited to the inner-sanctum of the Foursquare conference) he, finally, comes across as quite provincial.  He seems to actually believe that the media industry is the most powerful industry in the world and that we, all of us mere bumpkins, simply bow and scrape and accept every one of its pronouncements, promotions, and products. The standard ploy, regurgitated here, is that the fearsome enemy has all power but is simultaneously a complete and ineffectual fool.  I don't know why this ploy works, but it does and is never true.  One only needs to note the endless failures of network TV shows, magazines, movies, and books to skewer that kabob.  Just as the small time villager projects his values and manner of life on the world, so does the blinkered Mr. Wolff.<br />But that is his job, his gig, his sense of himself.  And more power to him, I suppose.  Wolff writes with style and if you like that style, acerbic lapels and all, you will like this book.  It really is all about style being its substance.  There is actually no serious analysis that will do the student of business much good.  But nearly everyone likes to read the dirt on the rich, powerful and the formerly rich and powerful.  That is what this book provides.<br />I am giving this book four stars because I think it succeeds at what it is trying to be, however, for my personal tastes I would give it two stars.ete and ineffectual fool.

Well written.	Since this is a legal casebook, this book is targeted for lawyers who want background on corporate acquisitions.  It is terrific for this.  Great and relevant cases with very good write-ups.  Plus it has some very nice introductory material on the role of lawyers in adding value to the acquisition process and offers a decent summary of the principles of corporate finance.<br />But I think it has real value for the businessperson who is going to be hiring lawyers to help him or her in the process of acquiring or being acquired.  Just as this book provides some background on finance for lawyers, it provides a great deal of good background that every businessperson needs to know and where things can go wrong.<br />At over 1,500 pages it is a huge book.  It is unlikely that you will ready it from cover to cover, but it is engagingly written.  So, if you enjoy this topic I think you will find yourself dipping into it on a regular basis.  There is an index and a list of all the cases cited in the book, plus a very interesting list of the authorities cited including their writings.<br />This book was originally published in 1986 with this second edition coming out in 1995.  There have been some separate updates published since then, which can also be found on Amazon.  I have not looked at the updates and found this book to be satisfactory for my purposes.  It is interesting to get so much background on some very famous cases and see how eight years has offered new perspective and how much is forgotten in the popular consciousness.  If you are involved in acquisitions I think this book deserves to be on your shelf.  I don't know how you could think you have been diligent without consulting this standard text.  I bought it as a recommended supplementary text for a course I took on corporate control as part of the MBA program at the Michigan Business School.	2003-11-03

I enjoyed the book a great deal.  I had no idea what Hill Stations were, was pretty vague on the colonial history of India, nor have I been able to clearly understand the cultural transitions since independence and partition.  My sense of the British and American exploits in southeast Asia prior to the Second World War are even more slight.<br />The Hill Stations were places the colonists (particularly the British) built up in the mountains to get away from the heat and disease of the tropical lowlands.  They tended to live lavishly and in the case of Simla, built the summer capital there.  This book is a wonderful introduction to that history in Pakistan, India, Sri Lank, Burma, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines.<br />Since the end of the colonial period these stations have been taken over by the governments in some cases and in others by private enterprise.  The author visited all of the stations she talks about in the book and gives us very interesting observations on what has been kept intact (if decayed) from the former times (including bad cuisine and slow service in one station) and what has been modernized and to what effect.  In almost all cases the vastly increased domestic populations have led to more building at the expense of the local flora and especially the fauna.<br />I think the saddest visit she describes is the military ruination of Burma (now Myanmar) by its removal of history, education, and learning from its population.  Just hideous, but unfortunately, far from unique.  The detail and personal experiences of this tragedy add to the value of the really marvelous little book.<br />If you know about these places from your own experience you may or may not like what the author has to say.  I came to this book completely ignorant of these places and  may still be.  However, I enjoyed the tour this book gave me and I think it taught me a great deal.  The author provides a nice bibliography for further reading and an indexnk it taught me a great deal.  The author provides a nice bibliography for further reading and an index	2003-10-27

He always made interesting points, offered some startling insights, and was generally fun - he was even acerbic in a fun way.<br />He wrote this book for the general audience, of which I am a part.  I cannot hope to challenge his or even approve of his professional points.  I don't really have the training.  But I can offer impressions.  It seems to me that when he is talking about science he is very good and gave me quite a bit to think about.  Honestly, he gave me some new views on distributions and natural selection that will stick with me.<br />I found his sociological and philosophical conclusions drawn from these observations to be somewhat strained and overburdened his evidence a bit.  He really doesn't address the concept of decadence much as it relates to the dying out of things.  For example, baseball could very well be played better than ever and yet not be played as well as it could be because of secondary desires such as home runs instead of base hits.<br />What fans want to see leads to a selection in a style of play that pleases them and brings in money.  Then money is the point of the game and not pure excellence in play.  Therefore, the best athletes of all time could be playing the game and yet their style of play would be less effective than it could be because of what the fans want to see.  But wouldn't a style that led to more wins be adopted?  Certainly, no one would adopt a losing strategy.  But maybe the optimal difference is only slight but pleasing the fans brings in so much more money that it changes the way everyone plays the game.  Football did this to make their game a passing game - which fans like more.  Clearly, with the rules and styles all supporting the pass, no team can be based primarily on the run as they used to be.<br />Anyway, the book has some very interesting points to make, it isn't a difficult read, and I think you will get some good food for thought.  Enjoy!	2003-10-20

This is one of the foundation books of the modern business education.  Yes, it was written over twenty years ago and you cannot take a business course anywhere without the term &quot;Porter's Five Forces&quot; not at least being mentioned.  But, really, this book is still completely relevant and should be on every businessperson's bookshelf, front and center.<br />For a concept that has so much a place in b-school discussions, you might think the book focuses on the 5-forces, but it is only a small part of the book.  It outlines the Generic Competitive Strategies (again, a now well known topic), Competitor Analysis (extremely valuable), Market Signals, Competitive Moves, and so much more.<br />The book is in three parts, General Analytical Techniques, Generic Industry Environments, and Strategic Decisions.  There is an appendix on Portfolio Techniques in Competitor Analysis, and a very useful appendix on How to Conduct an Industry Analysis.<br />I think a lot of times this book is not given as active a place in the pantheon as it deserves because so many books and articles are recycling a lot of what was in this book and most don't add much to the discussion.  Honestly, this book is worth referring to over and over and over again.  It is a tool or a weapon in your competitive war chest that needs to be kept active and in play.	2003-10-20

Now that we are coming out of the recession and there are signs that companies are starting to do some hiring (even though others are still cutting back), it is good to revisit this topic.<br />Though this book was written during the boom when employees simply could not be found, that really doesn't affect the value of this book.  Think of this as a handbook of important information you need to think through when considering outsourcing and you will have a better idea of what you will find here.<br />The author provides information to help you think through the various types of outsourcing, its positive and negative aspects, and great information to help you navigate the legal minefields that can turn a good outsourcing project into a bad one.  As just one example that has hurt many companies, when someone you thought wasn't an employee actually becomes one for legal purposes.  There is also a guide to other resources, some helpful appendices, helpful illustrations, and much more.<br />The information in this book will repay the price of purchase many times over.	2003-10-20

Reading this book is as much a treat as eating the wonderful food at Zingerman's.  It is like going on a food expedition with an enthusiastic guide who wants you to share in the fun he is having.<br />This isn't just a book on food history, or a treatise to teach how to discern quality food from mediocre food products, nor is it a book of recipes.  It is more than all of these.  Ari has the goal of helping us understand how to choose and enjoy great foods from all over the world.  He has grouped the book in to six sections and each of these in to subsections.  For example, the section on cheeses starts with a guide to buying cheeses, and then has subsections on Parmigiano-reggiano, cheddar, mountain, blue, and goat cheeses.  Each of these subsections concludes with a few recipes to provide some ideas on how to enjoy the foods you have just read about. What I particularly like about the recipes that Ari has chosen is that they are mostly very simple preparations that maximize the experience of flavor and aroma.<br />The book also provides mail-order sources for obtaining quality foods and a nice reading list for further exploration.  There is also a general index and a recipe index.<br />I was fortunate to be introduced to Zingerman's Delicatessen not long after it opened.  The fun of eating there is only half the story.  Learning about full flavor foods you haven't experienced before and exploring new tastes is another.  Ari Weinzweig and Paul Saginaw are very generous people who love food and love sharing what they learn with others.  They have contributed to the Ann Arbor community in many ways and not the least of their contributions is the education they have provided to their customers about great food.  They have earned their glowing worldwide reputation.  Simply, Ari and Paul and their great staff have contributed to a higher quality of life for many of us.<br />Over the years they have grown their ability to share their love of great food by adding catering, mail order, and a web site.  They opened a bake-house to improve the quality of their bread, and baked goods.  They developed a first rate training business called ZingTrain to educate their staff and anyone interested in learning what makes Zingerman's what it is.  A year and a half ago they opened a Creamery to expand their love of cheese and make some of their own with special attention to their amazing award winning Cream Cheese and stunning Gelato (when was the last time you had a frozen dessert with an aroma?).  Now they have opened a sit down restaurant called Zingerman's Roadhouse whose motto is \\"Really Good American Food\\".  It really is amazingly good.<br />Zingerman's is an amazing and growing institution because of the passion of its founders and the execution of a fabulous staff.  This book is yet another contribution to help us enjoy our lives just a little more.

I would love to have had the opportunity to take a class or two from him.  He writes well and he has had some impact on the public economic policy debate over the past couple of decades.  I am willing to consider what he has to say not only out of respect, but because I believe one should seek to understand a range of opinions and not just those that endorse our own prejudices and even our own considered conclusions.<br />Are you waiting for the \\"But\\"?  Well, here it is.  My problem with this book is that I can't find a structured argument for its proposals and even its proposals aren't all that specific.  It seems to me that serious proposals also need to consider the expected best criticisms to their plan.  Great chess players don't make moves hoping their opponents will not see their plan.  They make their moves believing that their plan will defeat even the best moves of the opponent.<br />Here, Dr. Thurow makes some anecdotal analysis of the economic problems of the United States, Europe, and Japan (which are not bad, as far as they go), and winds up with a call bold government action being needed to turn things around.  Given all his public writing, wouldn't his desire for more government be predictable?  He tackles a variety of issues, but comes back to the solution being some kind of government action.  Given the mammoth bureaucracies we take for governments nowadays, is it really likely that they will even desire bold action let alone be able to overcome their massive inertia even if they desired act?<br />The way he defines some terms frustrates me as well.  I find his describing capitalism being based upon greed a biasing argument, glib, and unpersuasive.  Certainly, socialist bureaucrats, tyrants, and anarchists can be greedy as well.  Saying that Capitalism is based upon competing self-interests rather than using \\"greed\\" would have been a more useful term with a bit more subtlety in making the debate.<br />Also, he lumps big corporation executives into the capitalist class.  That could only be true if they actually believed in private enterprise.  However, most mega corporations today work hard to use the government to protect them from competition or failure (both required under capitalism).  They want to use the power of government to enhance their rewards and distort markets.  That isn't capitalism, but it is human nature.  While he does touch on this phenomenon on page 42 vis-?-vis the California electricity crisis, I think he sees it as a part of capitalism rather than a corrupting human tendency that needs to be managed and guarded against in any economic system.<br />But this big-government big-business monstrosity is what we have now.  However, this is another topic and a debate that is not really germane to this review.<br />His notion of a Chief Knowledge Officer (chapter 9) is, I think, a pipe dream.  I cannot conceive of a real world political way for such an office to exist successfully in a decision making process.  What would make this person's view of the future any better than anyone else's?  Who would anoint such a person as effective?  And if they were, wouldn't they seek the CEO role?  And if they weren't why would anyone listen to them?  He or she would be marginalized quickly and ignored in practice.  Dr. Thurow does cite Bill Gates, but Mr. Gates has a unique position as a founder and owner of a huge portion of the company's stock.  Mao also ran China after stepping down as Chairman and resigning from the party.  That is also not a typical way for a despot to wield power.  Both are exceptions that serve to prove the rule rather than provide models for others.<br />Only those on the extreme right would deny a role of the government in creating and enforcing property rights and in promoting competitive markets.  And only a few would argue that government ownership of the means of production makes much sense.  The debate we all really participate in is the proper role of government in this process and Dr. Thurow states his beliefs and his reasons for them with clarity and energy.<br />However, I don't believe this book is going to persuade anyone on the right.  It may be useful to those who agree with Dr. Thurow on the need for more International Government and want to have some more debate material. But I really would have liked to hear more debate on the horrors of the Terror, The Great Leap Forward, and the Cultural Revolution rather than simply saying Socialism is good on infrastructure investment, but poor on infrastructure maintenance.  To me, that just seems to be an odd conclusion.<br />Don't get me wrong.  Just because I read the book and found myself disagreeing with Dr. Thurow doesn't mean I didn't find things of value in the book or that I don't think you should read it.  There are things to think about that will force you to flesh out your position.  I am willing to state that he may well be right and I might be wrong, but of course I don't think so.  However, I do believe the book could have used a somewhat tighter focus and a more explicit structure to its argument and conclusions.

Richard Fortey takes us on an adventure that began about 500 million years ago.  He uses his lifetime of experience and study to share with us the amazing things scientists have learned about trilobites over the past 300 years. Not only are there more kinds of trilobites than I had ever imagined, scientists have figured out more about their lives (as species not as individuals) than I would have ever believed possible.  It is just incredible.<br />But the book isn't just about trilobites.  The author shares wonderful stories from his own life and the lives of those that have spent their lives learning about these creatures.  We also get to learn about science and the various arguments that have arisen over the centuries and how they were resolved (or continue to this day).  The author even throws a yellow flag on a heated debate between the now sadly late Steven Jay Gould and Simon Conway Morris for becoming unprofessionally vitriolic.<br />This is a fabulous book for anyone who wants to read a non-technical book about natural history.  It is written with great style and a deft touch that never overwhelms the non-specialist nor becomes so frothy that it loses the ability to communicate serious and wonderful things.<br />I think this would be an especially wonderful book for young people to read who are interested in science and want to learn more about what it is and what a life spent studying science is really about and what it is like.  Fortey demonstrates clearly the work involved, the rigors required, and the where the rewards are.<br />Reading this book made me wish I knew where I put that trilobite head and tail I found in an Ohio quarry when I was a boy.  It makes me want to go out with a geologists hammer and find some more.  Maybe it will inspire some young men and women to take that inspiration more seriously and take it on as a career.  Just great.  Thanks, Dr. Fortey.	2003-09-24

They tell us about the man by dealing with the issues of his life using the chronology to give context and substance to these issues.  This book on Hamilton is very enjoyable to read and helped me learn more about the greatness and humanity of the man than I had understood before.<br />We learn about Hamilton's foreign birth and unlikely beginnings.  We follow his rise and learn about the many strengths he had.  Brookhiser is sympathetic to Hamilton's merits, as I believe we should be, but he doesn't shy away from his limitations either.<br />The author also takes on the various debates and controversies that still surround facets of Hamilton's life.  The author cuts through them and shares his conclusions with us including what cannot be resolved and what the various contentions would mean if it were to hold.<br />This book reads quickly, but deserves some mediation and consideration rather than a dash through.  There are some helpful pictures, many helpful notes and an index.	2003-09-20

It is concisely told in a clean style with energy to spare.  Posner starts the book with a seemingly minor event (the murder of Emir Shalabi) that turns out to have major implications in the power shift among the participants in the extreme elements in the Islamist war against the West.<br />We also get interesting information about the events around the trial of the Blind Sheikh Omar Rahman, the assassination of Rabbi Meir Kahane, the '93 bombing of the World Trade Center, the embassy bombings, the attack on the Cole, the lessons the terrorists took from our cutting and running from Somalia, and so many more of the preliminary incidents and battles in the War on Terror.  More sad than the events themselves is our collective delusion at the time that these were isolated incidents (such as the shooting on the Empire State Building Observation Deck).  The author reports these events clearly and with just enough intelligent analysis and insight to show us how all these flow into the same river of violence without ever letting the narrative getting bogged down.<br />Posner doesn't play the easy blame game of trying to make any one person or any one agency or administration THE fall guy.  There are so many failures leading up to the towers crashing to the ground that each and every one of us can take at least a cupful of blame.  Yes, some of our public servants and political leaders deserve barrelfuls or even a lake full of blame, but when you and I paid more attention to the OJ Simpson trial or to the circus around the murder of JonBen&eacute;t Ramsey than the trial of Sheikh Rahman, well;  none of us can really claim innocence because we were telling our leaders we weren't serious about this issue.<br />We can't hide saying we weren't told.  There were voices in the wilderness warning us, but we at least have to be honest enough to admit that, at the time, we really didn't want to know.  We wanted to continue believing everything would be OK.  We wanted to believe that the first bombing of the WTC was done by some crazy dolts who couldn't get it right.  We wanted to believe everything was somehow under control.  This book helps us understand the consequences of such willful ignornace.<br />Posner gives us the facts behind the scandals that led to the Congressional attacks on the FBI and CIA that put them on a short leash and gave what amounted to aid-and-comfort to our enemies.  But there were (are) also inter-agency rivalries and deep-seated distrust that kept (keeps) vital information filed away and away from where it would do good.  We learn about Presidential tough talk that carefully avoided tough action because of the possible political fallout.  And when a decision to get real is finally made, the bureaucracy around the President moves too slowly until the horror finally hits home.<br />The book is a gripping read and culminates in the fascinating interrogation of Abu Zubaydah.  You will never forget this chapter because it reads as if it should be in a novel or a big budget movie.  As this book has been promoted I have heard weaselly denials from certain foreign authorities that the things discussed in this chapter ever took place.  However, when you actually read this book you will believe that this stuff did happened.  Especially when you read what actually followed right on the heels of this interrogation this chapter rings as true as a huge and beautiful church bell.<br />This is a book I wish everyone would read, but watch your blood pressure.  This book is just right for our times and will help you make better judgments about what we should be focusing on as a country to deal with the very real threats we continue to face.es in the wilderness warning us, but we at least have to be honest enough to admit that, at the time, we really didn't want to know.

It should be read by anyone who invests because it will give you a better understanding of not only the Enron case, but of the problem of corrupt executives playing fast and loose with their responsibilities to the investors who employ them.  Remember, the investors own the company, not the executives.  They are hired help who are supposed to look after the interests of those who have put up hard cash for stock in the corporation and who are taking the financial risk as residual claimants. (Of course, those taking risks include the employees who probably have retirement investments in the company).  It is a lively read and provides a great deal of valuable information along with the intrigue and outrageous revelations.<br />There are three story lines that flow like counterpoint.  I found them riveting, but I enjoy reading about business. (You probably do as well, or why are you reading about this book?)<br />First, we follow Rebecca Smith and John Emshwiller as they track down leads in developing news stories about the sudden resignation of Enron's young CEO, Jeff Skilling.  This seemingly minor story develops into the amazing and unexpected collapse of Enron as its corrupt financial dealings and improper accounting practices are exposed.  We also follow the race between the authors as reporters for the Wall Street Journal racing against the New York Times, the LA Times, and the national TV news programs to get the story out first.<br />Second, we get the story of Enron and how Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, and especially Andy Fastow worked hard to keep the true state of the company hidden from investors and regulators.  We see how they drew others into their plans and punished those who wouldn't go along. The story makes clear how Andersen was brought down by an account team that allowed their lust for tens of millions of dollars in consulting fees to corrupt their accounting responsibilities.<br />Third, we see how both the climb and collapse of Enron affected average and honest people just trying to do their jobs.  It was easy to get caught up in the rise of Enron and to believe in what was going on because the sickeningly corrupt practices were kept hidden for so long.  Some of these executives, who reaped untold millions in personal rewards, might argue that everything was disclosed as required by letter of the regulations.  But it seems to me that it was all just a way of lying while going to the right up to the edge of violating the letter of the law and then slipping over.  Enron and Andersen management ended up not being as slick as they thought and ended up destroying both companies and hurting tens of thousands of innocent folks.<br />Another virtue of this books is that it is straight reporting.  Rather than being advocacy journalism, it reports the facts of the case as they unfolded.  I like this approach a great deal and think it strengthens the message of the book.  You are free to make your own interpretation of the events presented.  The authors do express their own reactions to certain events and revelations, but do not draw final conclusions of guilt or innocence.  Nor do they try to apportion blame, although they do report comments and judgments of others who do.<br />Really, I wish this book would be read widely because it would help potential investors realize the need they have to pay close attention to the management team of companies they choose to invest in.  They also need to educate themselves as much as possible on the industries and accounting practices of not only the companies they invest in, but also their competitors.  Such awareness can help set off the \\"something isn't right\\" detector.  Unfortunately, when things appear to be going well hard questions are usually not asked and when things fall apart it is usually too late to start asking.<br />This is a fine book that will have a permanent place on your shelf of business books.of Enron affected average and honest people just trying to do their jobs.

Keegan does an admirable job of setting up the competing viewpoints about the start of the war.  He calls the beginning mysterious and I suppose that is true.  I have always found that whole of the Great War a vague cultural memory until I read this quite valuable book.<br />It is almost impossible to capture the mindset that unleashed this horrible convulsive nightmare as if it were going to be some sort of quick and simple vindication of the home team.  Yet it appears that all sides had little concern for the war at its beginning.  Yet, it soon descended into a fiery pit that consumed the youth and treasure of Europe and the western world.<br />While Keegan is obviously and proudly British, his objectivity is admirable.  He praises and criticizes the deserving on all sides of the conflict.  He wants to help us understand what happened so we can begin to fathom they whys (which always have to come after understanding the what, where, how, and when).<br />I particularly enjoyed Keegan's description of the breaking of armies in 1917-18 and his description of the way the war ground to its end.  Its end seems almost as strange as its beginning.  The war was a convulsive madness that kept the combatants struggling beyond all reason and sense and then, it seems one day they just decide to stop.<br />Keegan's statement that the Second World War was a continuation of the First is becoming a more common view and will, I believe, become the standard view and the way the wars will be discussed.  Given the strange beginning of the war and the viciousness with which it was fought, it seems natural that the victors would take an out their rage on the vanquished.  We know now that this lopsided peace sowed the seeds of the whirlwind we still call World War II.<br />If I have one criticism of the book, it is that I think it really does give America's participation in the war short shrift. This seems like over compensation to me.  If America has a fixation on its role in winning the World Wars at the expense of blinding itself to the great sacrifices of other peoples in bringing about victory, it seems to me that the sacrifices of American lives seem barely mentioned beyond their being a lot of them and their being more enthusiastic than efficient.  There is simply so much to tell in such a small space that everything is told more briefly than its partisans would like and I am an American partisan.<br />At the very end of the book, Keegan says, &quot;If we could understand [the war's] loves as well as its hates, we would nearer understanding the mystery of human life.&quot;  I think this is can be a spur to other analyses of the war.  Once we have the prosecution of the war in our minds the deeper whys can be asked.  I think once such book is Glenn Watkins' wonderful &quot;Proof Through The Night: Music and the Great War&quot;, which adds a great deal to the cultural impact of the war and the culture's impact during the war.  If you want to read something beyond the arguments about the battles and politics, Watkins is a great book to read.<br />You cannot read just one book and hope to have more than a superficial understanding of this awful conflict.  However, this is a great volume to get a handle on the outlines and battles of the conflagration.  There is a topical bibliography and many footnotes that will aid further reading and study.

I did not know much about the history of the early big life insurance companies and little about high society in New York and Paris just before the First World War.<br />There are many books about the men who actually built these early business empires, but not much about their children and what became of them as they tried to find their own way in the world.  This transition of wealth and power to the second generation is a fascinating subject.<br />&quot;After the Ball&quot; is about just such a man of the second generation, James Hazen Hyde.  His father, Henry, had founded The Equitable Life Insurance Company and like many of the early business tycoons, he was tough, had control of his subordinates, and wanted his children (especially the oldest surviving son) to take a prominent place in the world with a fine education, social and political connections, as well as money.<br />When Henry died at 65 in 1899, James had just graduated from Harvard.  The father doted on the boy, but really didn't prepare him for the role he was going to be thrust into.  Maybe the father expected to teach him before he died, but he waited too long.  Henry's associates at The Equitable at first treated the boy with seeming respect and support.  But soon their avidity got the better of them.<br />James Hazen Hyde had learned to live lavishly.  The book taught me more about coaches and their place in society in the late 19th and early 20th centuries than I thought there was to know.  It is a small topic, but interesting and very informative about life among the wealthy at that time.  Another important part of society was entertaining the right people and being entertained by them.  Lavish Balls were a part o this social interaction.  James Hazen Hyde gave a fabulous Ball that became legendary, but legendary in a way that was not helpful to his future prospects of running the Equitable.<br />The public, who had formerly loved reading about these expensive entertainments, was now more resentful of what it considered waste and considered such extravagance an affront to the current egalitarian mood.  James Alexander and Gage Tarbell, associates of James Hyde's father, used this publicity as a pretext to go after the son.  They used lies about the expense involved and company funds being used to pay for it.  It was largely a PR war at first and it seems they expected the boy to turn tail and run.  Hyde didn't run.  The fight ended up bringing everyone down.<br />The book does a very good job of showing us how Alexander, who took over the company after Henry dies, and Tarbell, who wanted to push out both the son and Alexander, warred against the son.  In the process, others such as E.H. Harriman got involved.  Along the way, the self-serving practices rampant in the industry were exposed and everyone came out looking bad and lost their positions.  In the end, these fellows blew up the entire insurance industry as it had been run.  James Hyde at least had the excuse that he was just doing what the others were doing when he arrived on the scene.<br />James Hazen Hyde left for his beloved Paris to let things cool down.  He stayed much longer than he had expected.  In the end he married without success three times, he had a son, Henry, with whom he was unable to develop a close relationship.  James Hyde continued to live at the extreme limits of his reduced wealth, lived a long time and therefore left little or nothing for his son when he died.  The son became a successful and decorated officer for the OSS during World War II and himself lived a good long time.<br />It is an interesting story, but this isn't a typical business book.  Nor is it simply a biography. It mixes in a lot of different things.  But this is a bit of a different kid of story and I think it requires this kind of telling.  There are footnotes and a bibliography if you want to read more about the topics discussed in this book.<br />You can spend several hours getting many good things from this interesting book and feel like you invested your time well.<br />Now for a small, but not insignificant point. The book has at least a couple of curious factual errors that jumped out at me.  Maybe this is picayune, but:<br />1) On page 62 the author states that John D. Rockefeller died in 1913 and that he left an estate of nearly a billion dollars.  Well, he actually died in 1937 and had given away most of his estate to his various charities and to his son and family.  He once said that if he hadn't given so much away he thought he would have had a billion dollars, but the book is wrong as stated.  Ron Chernow's &quot;Titan&quot; is a really great biography of Rockefeller and I recommend that as well.<br />2) Diaghilev was never a dancer or choreographer as stated on page 315.  The great Nijinsky, however, was and he was in the Ballet Russes, which Diaghilev founded with Bakst and Benois.  Diaghilev was the impresario.<br />These kinds of little errors undermine reader confidence in the other things the author states in the book.  However, this book has a lot to recommend it.  So, if you want to know more about life in the gilded age and the social style of the times along stories of trying to be the successful son of a very dominant father, betrayal by people who had made intimations of friendship and support, politics, greed, and downright foolishness, then this is a good book for you.several hours getting many good things from this interesting book and feel like you invested your time well.<br />Now for a small, but not insignificant point.

It helps us understand better the sources of the Scottish Enlightenment and how that influenced not only the development of the British Empire, but the role it played in the American Revolution and in the Industrial Revolution everywhere.<br />You will find all kinds of colorful personalities.  There is enough detail that unless you are a scholar of a particular person, you will likely learn something new.  For example, even if you know David Hume was a Scotsman, how could you ever tell from his writing that he always spoke with a strong Scottish burr?  And that is just a very minor point.<br />There is also the issue of the real kilt versus the standard Highland dress we know today that was dreamt up during the Regency period.  But there is also the very real tragedy of the Clearances during the same time.  When landlords realized they could make more money raising sheep than having people and farmers on their land paying rents they drove them off even if it meant burning them out.  But that sent more people to America and into the British Army and thence to India and spread the culture around the globe.<br />It is true, however, that by the end you begin wondering if other cultures couldn't tell a similarly comprehensive tale because events are so complex and so many people are involved that you only need one of your team in there to claim the whole thing.<br />It is clear to me that the Scots were and are a remarkable people (my ancestry goes back that way, so I am biased), and there are singular achievements that are clearly theirs.  But there comes a point where you have to draw the line and admit that you were simply one of the participants and not the single progenitor.<br />However, I recommend that you take a few hours and read this book.

However, trying to guess who he is (and Woodward and Bernstein have admitted it is a he) has become a cottage industry and fun game to play.  It does seem that there are a finite number of possible suspects and trying to ferret out who he is should be possible if Woodward and Bernstein are telling the truth.<br />And this book should be read for the fun of it, not for any deep serious purpose.  Leonard Garment was on at least in the Nixon Whitehouse to some degree and does bring some insight to the game.  But is the person he identifies as Deep Throat really the guy?  Well, that person denies it.  But since he wants his identity secret, wouldn't he deny it if identified?  In this game there is no allee-allee-in-free.  We aren't going to find out for sure who he is until after Deep Throat dies - if WE outlive him.<br />But I like Garment's arguments and the insights he offers to why he things these folks aren't Deep Throat and why the one he selected is.  Maybe it is someone who isn't on the list at all.  Maybe it is someone no one has really heard of who had his own mole in the Whitehouse.  Who knows?  (Well, the four mentioned above do.)<br />So, if you are interested in this subject and like fun books, this is a good choice.  If you want to know definitively who Deep Throat is, well, you will have to wait.  In the meantime, let's have some fun!	2003-07-26

With all the added notes and helps you will not only understand the language of Shakespeare more clearly, you will also be able to come to your own informed opinions on this great work.<br />The richness of great works is their layering and their openness to multiple interpretations.  And yet, misreading and misunderstanding the language is more often the source of missing the point of the passage rather than adding to a richer understanding.  There are certainly creative misreadings, but those are made from deep understanding rather than superficial mistaken interpretation.<br />This edition has extensive notes with the text and when a topic requires longer treatment the notation LN is used for Longer Note.  You turn to the back and find the Longer Note by Act - Scene - Line Number and get a great deal of useful discussion about that aspect of the play.<br />There is also a 159 page introduction with context setting essays on the issues around the date of the play, its publication, the various texts and the debates over the merits and deficiencies of the First and Second Quarto and the First Folio, plus editorial problems, and a critical introduction.<br />All in all, this great play deserves to be read closely and returns riches for all the effort you can afford to put into reading it.

Since the author is well trained with an economics degree from Yale and a MBA in Analytic Finance from the University of Chicago, he understands that they are worth more as marketing tools than as actual guidance for an investor.  Mr. Zacks, who is also an investment columnist, explains carefully how and why analyst reports are biased and certainly cannot be taken at face value.<br />He explains that most analysts work for investment banks that depend on further customer business for their livelihood.  In fact, the investment banking fees are the way they earn the bulk of their money.  Therefore, they are very careful to not bite too hard on the hand that feeds them.<br />Analysts also work to build their reputation and tend towards a herd mentality that avoids taking the risk of being wrong alone.  It is safer to be wrong as part of a group than make a bold prediction and left twisting alone in the wind.<br />It isn't that investment banks necessarily tell their analysts to fabricate their reports or that analysts are sworn members of some secret cabal.  It is simple natural selection.  Analysts who are perceived as working against their firm's interests or who are boldly wrong and cost their customers large sums of money are going to lose their position in the industry and move on to other occupations.<br />So, why pay any attention to analyst reports?  Why not ignore them altogether?  Because analysts have access to a lot of valuable information that is difficult and costly for the average investor to acquire independently and you want to use it to your own benefit.<br />While the book discusses several approaches and strategies, the core of its approach is the estimate of earnings provided in these reports.  And more than that, not the earnings estimates themselves, but the CHANGES in earnings estimates.  According to the data Mr. Zacks provides, when analysts increase their earnings estimates it is a signal to buy because there are likely to be further upward revisions (owing to the conservative nature of analysts to not make bold predictions).  Conversely, downward revisions are sell signals.  Mr. Zacks also discusses the role or the Earnings Surprise and the Sales Surprise as predictors in certain strategies.<br />While the book provides the methods and calculations you can do on your own in order to find and track stocks according to the approaches described in the book, Mr. Zacks has a for fee service (it is less than a buck a day) that tracks thousands of stocks and ranks them for you daily.  The book gives you a code for a one-month trial to the service.  The service also provides rankings for the stocks that are based on the methods described in the book.<br />The strategies outlined in the book can lead to a great deal of trading, but not necessarily so.  And Mr. Zacks cautions against trading too much and avoiding letting transactions costs swallow up your returns.  He also points out that the trading approach described here really require a minimum of $25,000 to invest in order to provide sufficient diversification.  Less than that you should simply stick with index funds.<br />If you are the kind of person who wants to build and manage your own portfolio rather than investing in funds or indexes, this is an interesting approach that might serve you well.  Of course, the trick is in the implementation.  I found the book interesting and though provoking and would be interested in any comments you might have.

You cannot learn chemistry soiely from this book.  But that is not what this book is for.  This book is a series of chapters on the topics included in a high school chemistry course.  Within each chapter are a series of questions and solutions that are very pertinent to the topic being addressed.  However, there is no explication of the topics or discussion of the general principles of chemistry other than those included within the solutions offered.  So, if you have a rough familiarity with the topics this can help you flesh out your understanding.<br />So, as supplementary material to a course you or your child is taking or as a refresher this book is very appropriate and quite useful.  However, if you don't have some grounding in the topic you might get lost fairly quickly.  Don't get me wrong.  It isn't that it dives into the deep end of the pool too quickly.  The topics included aren't that esoteric.  It is just that if you aren't used to working with formulas and the terms of chemistry you might find it a bit confusing until you get acclimated.  Also, there are a few typos - so BE CAREFUL.<br />The book is printed in a way that it looks like it came from a typewriter which is very odd in 2003.  And there is no color.  All the diagrams are in black and white.  Nowadays, color ink isn't that expensive!  And used judiciously, it can help explain some concepts more clearly.  Of course, color can be misused as glitz and actually confuse things, but that is not what I am arguing for.  I think it wouldn't be that painful to modernize these books to current standards of media presentation and that it could actually help the students using the book.<br />I do recommend the book.  Just realize what it is intended for and I think you can get quite a bit out of it.  If you expect a course in high school chemistry, you won't find it here.	2003-07-15

The chapters consist of a series of questions and answers.  It is an interesting format, but is not sufficient to learn the topics.  Think of this as a supplement to regular study or as a refresher course and you will be closer to the mark.<br />The images included in the book are useful, but in this day and age I would have expected at least some use of color.  Color can aid understanding when used well.  However, too often it is distracting because it is used for glitz.  I am arguing to a judicious use to clarify the points addressed.<br />The one thing that disturbs me is the careless typos I have found (so how many have I NOT found?).  For example: on page 2 the give the exponential notation for microns in millimeters and meters.  Then they give Ångstroms in microns millimeters and meters.  However, they exponents for the meters are switched (backwards) between microns and Ångstroms.<br />Then on page 11 the first give the formula for acetic acid as CH3COO, but then as CH3COOH (which is correct).<br />These might confuse a student trying to get some background in the subject.<br />I wrote the company for this book and asked for the errata sheet and they told me that they were unaware of errors, but would check into them and get back with me.  The assured me they want to provide an accurate and dependable guide.  I believe them.  But right now, this one has a couple of issues that readers need to be aware of.<br />There is still a lot to be gained from working with this book.  Just realize what it is and what its limitations are and you will be fine.	2003-07-15

It is a powerful speech that rallies people at all times and everywhere.  Sir Lawrence Olivier made a film version in 1944 during WWII and Kenneth Branagh made another as recently as 1989.  You can count on there being more versions.  Epecially so when computers can help them make spectacular battle scenes (that aren't really in the play) with less expense.<br />Audiences love this play and they should.  There is a lot to like and enjoy.  I think upon repeated readings Henry becomes a more equivocal character than he seems at first.  And readers of the King Henry IV plays will know him before he became King Henry and know something deeper about his personality.<br />And of course there is the whole bit about the drive to France being sponsored by the Church to avoid confiscation of property by the Crown. Moreover, there is the slaughtering of the French prisoners, and his treatment of Falstaff (who dies offstage in this play).  This isn't revisionist stuff, it is right there in the play, but it is easy to miss the first time you are trying to take in the play.<br />In any case, this Arden edition is the one to buy and read from.  Why?  Because it has the most authoritative text, but that is only the beginning.  It also shows variants between the early sources.  The notes at the bottom of each page of the play are simply fabulous.  The editor includes not only helpful notes explaining what might be obscure in the text of the play, he provides sources Shakespeare probably used such as Holinshed and makes for some very interesting study.  There are also some helpful notes on how various scenes have been performed over time.<br />And to make this sound more like an infomercial, you get more!  The introduction provides great background material on the play, its sources, and how it has been performed throughout history.  After the play, there is a photo reproduction of the first Quarto from 1600 and it is fairly readable.  There are also a couple of maps showing the path of the English Army from Harfleur through other towns on its way to Calais and makes clear how they had to pass through Agincourt.<br />There is also a helpful genealogical table so you can see the confusing claims used by Henry and the French nobility to make their claims.  And there is a doubling chart so you can see how theater companies can perform all the roles with fewer actors.<br />This is a great edition as are all the plays published by the Arden Shakespeare.  The amount of work collected in these volumes is stunning and they will enrich your experience of the plays tremendously.  I can't recommend them enough.ere is a photo reproduction of the first Quarto from 1600 and it is fairly readable.

Eventually, Hotspur (Henry Percy) and Prince Hal (Henry Monmouth - later Henry V) battle in single combat.<br /><br />We also get to see the contrast between these young men in temperament and character.  King Henry wishes his son were more like Hotspur.  Prince Hal realizes his own weaknesses and seems to try to assure himself (and us) that when the time comes he will change and all his youthful foolishness will be forgotten.  Wouldn't that be a luxury we wish we could all have afforded when we were young?<br /><br />Of course, Prince Hal's guide through the world of the cutpurse and highwayman is the Lord of Misrule, the incomparable Falstaff.  His wit and gut are featured in full.  When Prince Hal and Poins double-cross Falstaff & company, the follow on scenes are funny, but full of consequence even into the next play.<br /><br />But, you certainly don't need me to tell you anything about Shakespeare.  Like millions of other folks, I am in love with the writing.  However, as all of us who read Shakespeare know, it isn't a simple issue.  Most of us need help in understanding the text.  There are many plays on words, many words no longer current in English and, besides, Shakespeare's vocabulary is richer than almost everyone else's who ever lived.  There is also the issue of historical context, and the variations of text since the plays were never published in their author's lifetime.<br /><br />For those of us who need that help and want to dig a bit deeper, the Arden editions of Shakespeare are just wonderful.<br /><br />-Before the text of the play we get very readable and helpful essays discussing the sources and themes and other important issues about the play.<br /><br />-In the text of the play we get as authoritative a text as exists with helpful notes about textual variations in other sources.  We also get many many footnotes explaining unusual words or word plays or thematic points that would likely not be known by us reading in the 21st century.<br /><br />-After the text we get excerpts from likely source materials used by Shakespeare and more background material to help us enrich our understanding and enjoyment of the play.<br /><br />However, these extras are only available in the individual editions.

So, Price Hal becomes King Henry V and this leads to the next play of that name.<br />The wonderful Falstaff is also on glorious display.  This is also the play with the famous tavern scene (Act II, Scene IV) that can be read endlessly with new enjoyment.<br />Everyone has his or her own take on Falstaff and his treatment at the hands of Henry V, but I dislike it even though I understand it.  Prince Hal and his transformation into Henry V is not someone I admire a lot.  Nor is Falstaff's manner of living, but his wit is so sharp and his intelligence so vast that it is easy to still delight in him.<br />But, you certainly don't need me to tell you anything about Shakespeare.

Giuliani opens and closes the book with the events of 9/11 and the work towards recovery from that terrible day.  However, this isn't a book about 9/11.  The book is a series of chapters each focused on a principle Giuliani believes is an important component of leadership.  He uses stories from his life and decisions he has made to illustrate these core principles of leadership.  He includes a few examples from sports and even opera (baseball and opera are among his passions).<br />Giuliani says he wrote this book himself and the language of the book seems to me to be his own. I like having that strong character identification rather than having the bland language of a ghostwriter.<br />This is not a theoretical textbook. It is a practical guide full of sound advice and some very interesting anecdotes. And for those who think of Giuliani as endlessly dour, there really is  a bit of humor. I think that anyone who wants to lead others could do a lot worse than reading this volume and keeping it handy on their shelf as a handbook for future reference. Leadership isn't particularly complicated in theory, but enormously intricate in application because it involves other people and their emotions.<br />Love him or hate him, Giuliani did have an impact on New York City and I believe it was strongly positive. I wish more folks who seek leadership positions all over our nation would adopt the lessons he offers here.<br />Some will point to this or that event that the author left out because it doesn't reflect favorably on him or because they disagree with the viewpoint he adopts and call it self-serving. Well, all that is certainly fair game. What amazes me is how frank and open he is about his mistakes and miscalculations. He doesn't claim inerrancy or infallibility. What he does claim for himself is energy, sincerity, and integrity. I think he demonstrates clearly and convincingly that he does have these qualities<br />Yes, I admire the guy and hope he continues his life of public service for a long time to come.m for himself is energy, sincerity, and integrity.

It is a short book, but it is not a slight one.  There is a lot here to meditate over, read again, and argue over.  Bloom certainly didn't write this expecting anyone to agree with everything he writes.  In fact, a teacher is poorly served by his students if they simply accept what he says as if it were scripture.  If the student doesn't understand or isn't persuaded, he must question.  If he disagrees, he must argue.  If he agrees, he must take what the teacher gave him and take it further.  Don't think that because this book quotes extensively from the play and is only 154 small pages long that you won't have a lot given you.<br />I enjoyed Bloom's &quot;Invention of the Human&quot; a great deal, but I am glad that he has given us more of his insights into Hamlet.  Bloom's thoughts about how the play should be presented, what other critics have written, how his own perspectives have changed over the years, what it means to have a play within a play within a play.  I also found his discussion of which verse is archaic and which is written to be understood as bad verse quite illuminating.  Since my ear cannot hear the shades of Elizabethan English quite so clearly I have to admit that I didn't pick up that the slaughter of Priam was supposed to be taken as awful.  I will have to work on hearing the language in all its varieties within this play and the others.<br />I think it is vital to remember that works like this provide their greatest value by giving us a path to further thought, study, and deeper reading.  We waste them by either accepting or rejecting their arguments at face value.  This is a book that everyone who loves Shakespeare and Hamlet should read and then make their own judgments.  I found this a very valuable book.	2003-06-19

Books	5	6	9	N	Y	A guide to investment sanity	Ben Stein and Phil DeMuth make a strong and easy to understand case for the power of price and the consideration of value in making investment decisions.  I am sure that more people are willing to listen to these arguments today than were willing to them in the fevered investment climate of a few years ago.  However, I wonder if they will forget the next time the fever hits.  Those that forget will simply make more opportunities for capital gains than those that remember and stay disciplined.<br />While the authors say they are using \\"technical\\" analysis to illustrate the principles they are espousing they are not really technical analysts in the voodoo sense you will see hyped in the financial media.  They are not telling us that we should buy or sell simply because a pattern type appears in a chart.  They do use graphs to illustrate their points, they aren't saying that there are points of resistance or breakthroughs or momentum or whatever.<br />What they do tell us is that there are times when stocks are a good buy and times when they are not a good buy and they give us several methods to consider.  There are:  1) Today's price versus the 15 year historical average price.  2) A very helpful and instructive consideration of the P/E ratio that sets aside much of the hype that has been used to try and keep selling overpriced equities. (If P/E is what you want to use, use the discussion in this book rather than anything someone trying to sell you something will tell you.) 3) Dividend Yields (remember dividends?) and why they are important.  4) Fundamental Value where the authors use Tobin's Q for years it is available and other proxies for that when it is not.<br />It may sound as if this is a very dry book and technical book.  It is not.  It is well illustrated and written in a very helpful and instructive way with real insight into what those whose jobs depend you selling you on buying equities are trying to do to you.<br />The \\"market timing\\" they are talking about here has NOTHING to do with the market timing of day traders.  Their argument is that dollar cost averaging is better for the equities sellers than it is for you.  There are indeed times that are better to buy equities than others.  Stein and DeMuth offer some tools for better seeing when times are better and when it is worse.  They also try to provide reasons why we should discipline ourselves to not buy when the herd of independent minds is in its most heated frenzy as it was in the late 90s.<br />Here are just two of the many comments that had me saying, \\"Amen!\\"<br />From page 90: \\"No one knows what future earnings will be.  Just because someone is willing to make up a number when asked does not mean it will come true.  It is difficult enough trying to get a company's board of directors to tell us what last year's earnings were with any reliability.\\"<br />From page 110: \\"In the short run, the stock market is a high school popularity contest where true value is overlooked.\\"<br />After showing us each of the measures they find compelling they show us how to combine them in ways that augment their value.  They also take the time to show us the limits of their method and urge us that misusing what they say here can be lead to disaster.  I find this interesting because it is using other methods precisely as prescribed that has lead to disaster for so many.<br />So, what Stein and DeMuth are basically urging us to do is to stop smoking the weed peddled by those trying to sell equities under all conditions and to do some financial exercises to better understand what we are doing with our hard earned and precious funds that we manage to set aside after our living expenses, taxes, and relatives.  Here they have given us a nice guide to generating some financial health.<br />They also offer general investment cautions beyond their method along with a helpful and short reading list for further study and consideration.  They also have a helpful website that provides somefree resources to help with the kinds of analysis the book discusses.<br />All in all I think this book is a much needed call to financial sanity and will help investors a lot more than nearly all of what they get told in the hype of the daily financial media.<br />Thanks Ben Stein and Phil DeMuth for this very readable guide to better investing.e free resources to help with the kinds of analysis the book discusses.<br />All in all I think this book is a much needed call to financial sanity and will help investors a lot more than nearly all of what they get told in the hype of the daily financial media.<br />Thanks Ben Stein and Phil DeMuth for this very readable guide to better investing.	2003-06-17

The book is about Newton's personal gift - his intellectual powers - and his gift to all mankind through his work in Mathematics (the Calculus), Physics (working out gravitation and motion), and Optics.  When I walk into Borders and see the tens of thousands of books on the shelves and realize that this still represents a small portion of the books written I think about the works that will still be in print in 300 years.  Probably you could pile them up in a small stack in the middle of a small room.  Newton's &quot;Principia&quot; and his &quot;Optics&quot; will certainly still be among them.  I believe these are among the immortal works of humanity.<br />Berlinski has a wonderful knack for making the arcane both accessible and lively.  He has a style that seems breezy, but is more sophisticated than that and even has a bit of a shimmer to it.  There are a few careless mistakes, but they won't get in the way of the story he is telling.  For example, on page 33 the circumference of the circle is labeled as time, but it is the AREA of the shaded wedges that is time.  The circle is distance.  The point of the diagram, I believe, is that when an orbit is closer to the center it moves faster over distance, but the area between the end points of the orbit and center is that same as the area when the orbit is further away from the center and the orbiting body is moving more slowly.  But anyone paying attention, I think, would see this pretty quickly.<br />I call this an Ideaography because the biographical portions are both helpful and concise, but by no means comprehensive.  And the book is not technical enough to be considered an explication of Newton's thought.  But it is quite successful as a Cook's Tour of Newton's life and thought.  It is ideal for intellectually awakening high school students or a quick introduction for college students.  It is a most helpful way to get the door open for further study and investigation.  There is a most wonderful &quot;Chrestomathy&quot; of the fundamental concepts discussed in the book and the key dates of Newton's life.<br />However, the book could certainly have used a reading list for further study.  Yes, other important works are mentioned throughout the text, but it would have been nice to have a good source for additional reading.<br />But these quibbles aside, I recommend the book as a nice to read introduction to Newton and his work.tudy and investigation.

1088713:US	53052943	R1V963MP8JBTD2	0674854292	116036272	Summer for the Gods: The Scopes Trial and America's Continuing Debate over Science and Religion	Books	5	101	108	N	Y	The most publicized misdemeanor case in American history	Edward Larson has accomplished something wonderful with this book.  In only 266 pages (318 including footnotes and index), he has captured the flow of cultural issues surrounding science, education, and religion in the early twentieth century, the political goals and maneuvering of the parties involved, the actual Scopes Trial in Dayton, Tennessee with the d&eacute;nouement of the appeal, the falsifying of the events involved in the popular culture, and the ongoing cultural impact of the issues involved in this trial.<br />As I read I found myself marveling at how Larson so richly captures the cultural forces coming together like tectonic plates and crashing into the Scopes trial.  I haven't seen as fair a treatment of the issues involved for all the varying parties (there were many more self-interested folks than Darrow and Bryan) on any other subject.  To have that time before the trial captured in such a beautiful way is very valuable.<br />As others have noted, the notion of the trial started as a publicity stunt to promote the hard luck town of Dayton, TN.  The ACLU wanted a narrowly defined test case to overturn the laws forbidding the teaching of evolution.  Darrow and his crowd wanted to attack religion more than work out the civil liberties issues involved, Bryan cared more about the rights of the parents as taxpayers to control what their children were taught.  Remember, universal public education was still a rather new thing in 1925 and parents then, as now, want to have the education support them in raising their children.  The education establishment then, as now, feels a responsibility to teach what they think best.<br />Bryan and many others were also concerned about the political uses to which evolution had recently been put in the name of survival of the fittest.  It isn't a simple issue and shouldn't be turned into a cartoon.  Especially since we are in some ways still grappling with these issues.<br />Yes, Bryan was also a Fundamentalist (although some were more Fundamental than him because he didn't insist on the strict 6 days of 24 hours for the Creation), but imposing that belief wasn't his goal.<br />Clarifying the truth of the trial versus the popular perceptions in our culture provided by &quot;Only Yesterday&quot; and &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; is a very valuable service provided by this book.  However, the culture seems to want the oversimplification and distortions of &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; more than the truth of Scopes being a willing participant in a test case more or less on a lark.  Or that Scopes never really &quot;taught&quot; evolution.  He had used the textbook provided to him by the school and it discussed evolution, but he may never have gotten to that section since he wasn't the regular biology teacher.  He taught physics, math, and football and was substituting in the biology class.<br />The book has a number of very nice pictures that also help capture the period of the trial and the characters involved.<br />One especially small quibble is that the book does not address the difference between the anti-clerical activities in Great Britain and their political nature because of the state power of the Church and the anti-clerical activities in the United States that were really anti-religion.  In fact, a great deal of the fundamentalist backlash against evolution came out of this anti-religion sentiment.<br />I think it a reasonable view to say that most of the reaction against evolution wasn't from a considered rejection of the theory, but a reaction against being attacked by those who wanted to free America of religion.  We didn't have a state church, although most in power were also believers (or publicly posed as believers).  The anti-clerical movement was transplanted but to somewhat different effect here than in Europe where evolution was not seen as necessarily inconsistent with Faith (as it has become to be viewed here).  But this is a trivial point compared to many wonderful insights this book provides.ful insights this book provides.	2003-06-14

It helped me understand the reality behind many of the rumors that have grown up around books like &quot;The Story of the Latter-day Saints&quot;, &quot;The Mormon Experience&quot;, and &quot;Brigham Young: American Moses&quot;.  I am also glad to know about the other wonderful books and articles he and his team put together over the years.<br />He had a difficult assignment in being directly affiliated with the Church and yet being tasked with producing professional history.  For the Church, the hand of God is a reality in all things.  But that kind of explanation doesn't hold any water in the halls of academe.  This required a special person to be able to walk that very thin line (since it was indeed the Church Leaders who gave him this almost self-contradictory assignment).<br />It was inevitable that there would be some who would take exception to this or that and at times there was more than exception taken.  Arrington put it well on page 144 &quot;... trying to do a job under conflicting instructions or pressures, was like a mouse crossing the floor where elephants are dancing.&quot;  I love this image and understand exactly what he means.<br />And there is a glorious chapter giving the background on the 1978 revelation on the priesthood.  Just terrific insights and enriching information.<br />I do wish, however, he had taken a few pages showing examples of historical writing that did go beyond fair professionalism and into being against the Church.  Clearly this writing does exist and probably did at least as much to undermine the purposes for which his office was originally set up as the complaints of the literalists.<br />This was a very enjoyable read and the background it provides makes it very worthwhile.	2003-06-04

An old saying begins by saying that success has many fathers.  There are many now who claim to have built digital general purpose computers before ENIAC and I am not qualified to adjudicate their claims.  However from all the claims made from all kinds of sources, it appears that no one else is either.  Because of the unimaginable effect digital computing has had on the world culture and economy there is just too much emotion, pride, and politics to let anyone's claim to priority stand unchallenged.  Even the courts have tortured the facts to invalidate the ENIAC patent in order to avoid an IBM - Sperry monopoly.  Those pesky ends justifying questionable means yet one more time.<br />Some of the \\"computers\\" claiming priority to ENIAC were actually electro-mechanical calculators, specific purpose (rather than general purpose) devices, or analog rather than digital computing devices.  This makes them not what ENIAC was.  The British Colossus was indeed a digital computer.  But it was used in top-secret code breaking and wasn't publicly known until 1970 and therefore didn't impact the course of development of computing.  What does first mean in this case?<br />I wish this book would be read by everyone - especially students.  It tells several important stories.  First, there is the almost forgotten story of ENIAC and the two men who designed and built her.  They were John Mauchly and Pres Eckert.  What they did in developing a general purpose digital computer in ENIAC and then EDVAC and finally with UNIVAC, changed the course of computing forever.  The story of Mauchly and Eckert should be remembered no matter what the many others claiming to be the fathers of success might claim.<br />The book also tells the tale how technology developed with paper tape, punch cards, magnetic tape, digital memory, calculating with gears versus vacuum tubes, and all that other early technical history that so many of us find fascinating.  I mean, contemplating how 1,800 square feet of computing power with 17,000 tubes improved calculating speeds by over 300 times is just cool to contemplate.  Now, the ENIAC's power is just a spec on a present day CPU made of silicon.<br />Then there is the cautionary tale of how these men really had success slip away from them for a variety of reasons.  There is much to learn here.  Some of it was personal jealousy by people you will meet reading the book.  Some of it was sheer politics including institutions like Penn and RCA that could have been at the forefront of computer science but didn't see the vision early enough.  Some of it was a lack of business savvy on the part of Mauchly and Eckert.  And sometimes the ball just bounces in funny ways that work against you.  Life is funny that way.<br />But history should work through all the facts and the story should draw good and proper lines from what was to what is.  Just as others traveled to the Western Hemisphere before Columbus, but his voyages opened the age of exploration and just as others had cars before Ford, but it was he who put the world on wheels, it was Mauchly and Eckert who opened the age of digital computers through ENIAC and this is a great telling of the story.<br />It is a very fast read and very worthwhile.omputing power with 17,000 tubes improved calculating speeds by over 300 times is just cool to contemplate.

He is one of the very few people writing on macroeconomics who is actually qualified to do so.  When you add to that his ability to make complicated concepts accessible to lay readers you realize how valuable he really is.<br />This is a short book that in four chapters that are fashioned from columns that Barro wrote for the Wall Street Journal.  However, the book does NOT read like a bunch of columns stitched together.  It reads like a well-formed book.<br />The four chapters are 1) Economic Growth, 2) Monetary and Financial Policy, 3) Fiscal and Other Macroeconomic Policies, and 4) The Power of Economic Reasoning.<br />There is a lot to think about in these 175 pages.  It doesn't take long to ready, but you won't want to dash through this.  This is the kind of writing that you want to think about and linger over, not because it is difficult, but because it seriously challenges many of our present society's basic operating assumptions.  I can't follow Barro all the way down the path he has taken, but I sure like most of it.<br />Reading this book is also a good way to introduce yourself to macroeconomic thinking and how it differs from microeconomics. It isn't a formal introduction, but the concepts are presented in such a clear manner that they can be grasped with just a little consideration of what the author is presenting.<br />Of course, there is a lot of serious study to do for the student who wants to understand macroeconomics in a serious way.  But this book can help the everyday person develop some good intuitions about fundamental macroeconomic principles.	2003-06-01

While the author takes us back to the ancient Pythagoreans and their determination to keep irrational numbers secret knowledge, the story really centers around Georg Cantor and his struggles in founding the study of mathematics in this field.  Cantor was a mystic as well and there is also more than one appearance of the Kabbalah.<br />Certainly, you can't learn the subject from this book.  However, like visiting some vast architectural wonder that you can only take in as a big view, this book places lots of Post It notes on important points if you want to begin reading more deeply about these profound ideas.  And if you don't, it is certainly a fund way to spend a few hours.<br />The author provides four pages of references for further reading, but if, like me, you don't know the field you will likely have to do preliminary studies to just get to the foothills of really taking on the subjects studied in this book.  If you already understand the math then this book is likely too light for you unless you somehow missed out on the history of your field.<br />I enjoyed the book and if you are interested in how serious thinkers learned to think about Infinity and what it actually means, then this book is a fine initial guide.	2003-05-31

When I saw \\"Jaws\\" in 1975 and heard Captain Quint's tale of the sinking of the Indianapolis I thought it was just a dramatic story.  If something like this had really happened surely I would have heard of it.  Sometime later I heard that it was a real story.  I wondered how such an awful thing could happen and it not be part of something everyone knows.  How could such a large ship be torpedoed without being missed for five days?  Why weren't we talking about it?<br />This well done and very readable book tells us how.  Like most disasters, it was an accumulation of small failures.  Among many other things, the captain wasn't given a proper digest of available intelligence about subs in the area and that a destroyer had been sunk recently along that route.  In fact, he was told that the risk was negligible.  The weather that night was spotty at best, but cleared enough just when they were around the Japanese sub that they could take their shot.<br />Because it was a very hot night and there was no expected danger the interior lockdown was lessened and those open hatches contributed to the water flooding the ship more clearly.  All the internal communications were taken out and the one person in the engine room thought that since they must be under attack he must keep the ship moving as fast as possible.  He had no way of knowing that the bow of the ship was gone and that he was ramming more water into the ship and causing it to sink faster.  There are more failures (particularly in the system that failed to report the Indianapolis missing), but you should read the book to find out all the things that came together to lead to this horrible event.<br />The story of how they survived five days at sea in the tropical sun without food or water or shelter or proper rafts or lifeboats is just heartbreaking.  Really, it was about how they died for five days and how people tenaciously held on to life.  They supported each other as long as they could, but when they finally broke there was real horror.  And, of course, the famous shark attacks are vividly told.  What is stunning is how the survivors became used to them.<br />It is the thirst that ends up being the greatest misery.  The author tells us about one of the survivors who can't be far from a glass of ice water even fifty-five years from the event.<br />Captain McVay was really a scapegoat.  Maybe that is the way the Navy operates.  I don't know that culture.  Clearly the author thinks the captain was brought up on carefully selected charges to avoid the discussion of why the boys were in the water for five days before they were rescued. The trial made a big deal out of the Captain's failure to take a zig-zag course even though policy at night in a low risk zone with low visibility allowed for the Captain to sail straight.  The prosecution even brought in the Japanese sub commander who sunk the ship and to their consternation he said that zig-zagging would have done nothing to prevent him from sinking the ship.  McVay was convicted anyway.<br />What was most awful for him were the Christmas letters he received from families of the boys that perished that were full of hate and blame.  While their anguish is real and it is unlikely that they knew the full story, it still seems cruel to go out of your way to inflict suffering on the Captain.  But they did.  I haven't suffered such a loss so it is hard to know.<br />The author tells this story very cinematically.  It reads almost like you are watching a mini-series.  It is an easy and gripping read that you will not want to put down.  This is a very worthwhile read.  I recommend it enthusiastically.broke there was real horror.

Like most folks, I had never heard of SOG.  I became aware of it because a friend of mine told me the name because he fought with the group during his three tours in Vietnam.  He has never said very much about his experiences because they are still classified. He responded to my many questions by pointing me to this book.<br />This is an amazing book.  Every page is full of bravery, loyalty, and heroism beyond understanding.  Well, there are a few shameful pages of cowardice and treachery and those few pages will anger and sicken you as much as the deeds of the heroes will amaze and fill you with awe.<br />SOG is the acronym for the Studies and Observations Group, which was a euphemism for a very secret and elite special operations team that was the forerunner of groups such as today's Delta Force.  They gathered intelligence about enemy activities and slowed enemy advances through Cambodia and Laos down the Ho Chi Minh trail and other places the NVA denied being.<br />I certainly can't do justice to the history of all this activity, but if you pick up this book you will have a very hard time putting it down.  You will be reading about actual flesh and blood men who are very extraordinary people and who did unbelievable things in service to America. The writing is captures the events very effectively and moves quickly.  For me, it was more exciting than any fiction.<br />John Plaster has done a service in taking us through the history of this group.  He shows us the formation of the group and its early development.  He covers its history through its most effective years to the way it was handicapped by policies that really ended up allowing the North Vietnamese to strengthen their position rather than bringing them to serious negotiations.  Finally, we suffer with them through the last days of the group as the war wound down.<br />Whatever your position on the war, you shouldn't diminish the nobility of these soldiers.  When I think about these stories I am profoundly moved by their sacrifice and feel a deep gratitude to each of them and all soldiers who put everything on the line for me and mine.<br />Thanks to Mr. Plaster for this vital and amazing book.the war, you shouldn't diminish the nobility of these soldiers.

It is principally the story of Joe Cassidy, a rather normal sergeant in the US Army, who was recruited to become a dangle for a Soviet Agent.  The ploy worked and Cassidy became a double agent for more than twenty years.  Of course, these kinds of stories rather quickly become rather entangled with lots of personalities and different threads of action.  The author, David Wise, does an especially fine job in telling this tale and helping us keep straight who is doing what when and to whom.<br />The details of surveillance and spycraft are fascinating because they are so mundane but in their context seem so strange.  This story demonstrates so many of the critical factors in running a counter intelligence operation: the importance of selecting the right agent (in this case Joe Cassidy), the necessity of patience and letting some things slip away in order to keep after the big thing, the chess like thinking of move and countermove in planning operations, the never-quite-sure aspects of whom to trust and what is real or what is a plant, and the role of just plain dumb luck.  It isn't like Hollywood, but in many ways is more strange than a movie.  If you tried to put some of this stuff in a movie people would complain that it was too far fetched.  Yet this is all real.<br />The book also has some rather chilling information on Nerve Agents, which was the whole point of this many year effort by the FBI and other government agencies.  It also has a lot of fascinating information on the devices of spy tradecraft including hollow rocks, rollover cameras, dead drops, micro dots, secret writing, and more.<br />Because the book is so well written it is a rather easy read.  This is a real achievement because of the complexity of the story, but David Wise has long experience as a skilled reporter and writer about intelligence work and knows how to tell these tales.  I recommend this book to everyone because it is just plain interesting, because I believe we should keep the reality and sacrifices of the Cold War in our collective memory, and because real people paid with their lives for our security.everyone because it is just plain interesting, because I believe we should keep the reality and sacrifices of the Cold War in our collective memory, and because real people paid with their lives for our security.	2003-05-14

Gordon Liddy	Books	4	3	5	N	N	A Vivid and Well Written Autobiography	When Watergate was actually unfolding in the news, G. Gordon Liddy was a mysterious entity because he would not talk. He was the only one (or at least the most famous) of those involved in the actual conspiracies to remain silent. He gained an exotic fearsomeness because he remained true to his beliefs in the face of overwhelming social and judicial disapproval and was willing to receive more severe punishment rather than bend and tell what he knew (compare Liddy to John Dean since they were both involved in the same plots and you can easily see the difference).  There were also rumors of his behavior from prison that made him out to be a very tough hombre, but I certainly didn't know much about him as a person.<br />This is his very frank autobiography. He begins by admitting that he was a frail child and takes us through his growing up and his obsession with controlling his own fear. At times this becomes a very strange story. For example, not many of us would feel the need to catch, kill, and eat a rat to prove to ourselves that we were no longer afraid of rats.<br />When we get to the Watergate stuff it is surprising how open and frank Liddy is especially when you consider how silent he was at the time. The whole of Watergate seems strange from the vantage point of today. I don't want to argue or debate any of the various faiths that have grown up around those events. You almost certainly have your own views and hold them strongly. Liddy certainly does. What is compelling is that this telling is from someone who was deep inside the events even if outside the Oval Office.  John Dean, with whom Liddy worked closely, certainly comes across differently than his media image.<br />This well written and engaging book ends when Liddy leaves prison after serving longer than anyone else related to Watergate. Liddy has had a very interesting career since then including, and this may be the strangest part, going on a debate tour with Timothy Leary. When Liddy was with the FBI he was involved in a raid on Leary's home which turned up nothing but is described in vivid and humorous terms in the book. Today, Liddy is a successful host of a radio talk show and has another best selling book entitled, \\"When I Was a Kid, This Was a Free Country\\".<br />This book is a worthwhile read on its own merits. When you add the interesting insights you can get about the events and people involved in Watergate, there is even more reason to read it.FBI he was involved in a raid on Leary's home which turned up nothing but is described in vivid and humorous terms in the book.

I found the book very useful and am glad that we used it.  Our texts were this book, a coursepack of other case studies and readings, and Ravi Anupinidi's (et al) &quot;Managing Business Process Flows&quot;.<br />This is a book of ten case studies along with case questions and supplementary mini cases.  Like all books that are compilations of case studies, they are of somewhat limited value to those who are trying to learn the field.  It is hard to know what you should be getting out of the case studies without the guidance of a skilled professor.<br />But these cases have good illustrations, helpful questions, and they offer a broad spectrum of business processes such as continuous flow, job shop, batch flow, combined, and so on.  It includes service, retail, and project management.  There is a lot here to think about and discuss.  If you have some experience with Operations Management and you want some more reading and you understand the purpose of case studies, this can be a good book to read.  But it is better as a textbook in a classroom setting with a skilled teacher as a guide.<br />If you are seeking a beginning text that will explain the field and guide you through the important principles involved in Operations Management, a book of case studies, which this book is, is not appropriate.  Although, if you are reading such a text and want supplementary material with a practical bent to it in order to give you some food for thinking about the principles you are learning, this book would be a great source for such material.	2003-05-03

I think it is a good textbook.  It has several virtues.  It is concise, it develops its ideas as the book goes along, the chapter problems help the student think about the principles being developed, and it covers the topic pretty well for a one term introductory course.<br />There are also many helpful illustrations and examples.  The book also includes a CD with some tools to help the student work some of the more complex problems.  A companion website is also available.<br />The one problem a person wanting to simply dive into a specific topic would have comes from the book continually developing its ideas from the beginning to the end.  The examples usually involve a fictional garage door manufacturing firm and if you haven't worked the earlier problems it can be difficult to have the data on hand to work the later examples or to even understand what they are talking about.<br />But in a classroom setting with a skilled and enthusiastic professor, as I had, this is a very useful book and I recommend it.	2003-05-03

In his youth, he was a very important diplomat in foreign courts at our nation's founding.  He was instrumental in bringing an end to the war of 1812.  He was a distinguished Senator and then Secretary of State.  As Secretary of State he helped shape the policy known as the Monroe Doctrine.  His presidency was a low point, but his vision for our country is still inspiring, if too far ahead of his own time.<br />After his Presidency he served in Congress until the day he died.  His career in the House of Representatives turned out to be the highlight of his amazing career.  There he was an important voice against slavery and against those who would sacrifice the treasures of the new nation for personal gain.  His was an important voice for the Union being something permanent rather than a compact between otherwise independent states.  This became a critical point leading up to and during the Civil War.  It is an important point today.<br />He fought tirelessly against the southern doctrine of Nullification (that states had the power to nullify federal laws with which they disagreed) and against the Gag Rule (which prevented anti-slavery petitions from being heard for many years).  The present Smithsonian Institution owes him a debt.  When James Smithson's gift came from England many wanted to use it for superficial short term benefit rather than found something permanent and wonderful as the present institution.<br />JQA had a keen mind and loved learning.  His youth was largely spent in Europe with his father and he was fluent in French and Latin and also learned Greek.  He loved culture: theater, opera, poetry, art, and dancing.  He taught rhetoric and oratory at Harvard and was a greatly esteemed public speaker throughout his long life.  The whole nation mourned when he passed on February 23, 1848.<br />His remarkable wife, Louisa, is also given a fine account in this wonderful book.  She was at least JQA's intellectual equal and was a source of strength to him that cannot be overestimated.  JQA loved his children, but the first two sons had sad, difficult, and short lives (JQA and Louisa had lost a young daughter when they served as diplomats in St. Petersburg).  When they died he grieved deeply.<br />Maybe being raised apart from their parents while they served our nation as diplomats in Europe hurt the older sons beyond recovery.  If so, they are victims of our need whom we should mourn.  The third son, Charles, was with his parents in their travels as JQA served in Washington and abroad.  Charles became a fine and successful man, husband, and father who also found the energy to take care of his father when JQA became old and needed many forms of help.<br />I loved this book and greatly admire John Quincy Adams.  Before I read this valuable book I didn't know anything about him.  I am so grateful for knowing more about this great American and his amazing life.  He should be much better known by every one of us.  We would be better off knowing about his service and the strength and energy he expended in fighting for his ideals.

When they died he grieved deeply.  <BR>Maybe being raised apart from their parents while they served our nation as diplomats in Europe hurt the older sons beyond recovery.  If so, they are victims of our need whom we should mourn.  The third son, Charles, was with his parents in their travels as JQA served in Washington and abroad.  Charles became a fine and successful man, husband, and father who also found the energy to take care of his father when JQA became old and needed many forms of help.<br />I loved this book and greatly admire John Quincy Adams.  Before I read this valuable book I didn't know anything about him.  I am so grateful for knowing more about this great American and his amazing life.  He should be much better known by every one of us.  We would be better off knowing about his service and the strength and energy he expended in fighting for his ideals.  He is more important to the present existence and preservation of our Union than I would ever have expected before I read this book.	2003-05-02

Race and racism is certainly one of those highly charged divides.  There is a lot of talk that is ostensibly aimed at the society at large, but is really positioned for consumption by one's political allies.  Precious little actual reaching out, searching for understanding or common ground occurs in present day discourse about race and a few other highly charged topics.<br />I first heard about this book as it was being attacked by one side of the debate and praised by another.  However, I only decided to read it after I heard the author interviewed.  Dr. McWhorter is often given a short hand label as this or that, but I sensed someone with a generous heart, sense of fun, genuine caring, and a very fine mind developed by a fine education and careful study.  In short, he is a very interesting person.  After reading this book I am quite sure that my impression was correct.<br />Most of all, this book is too often mischaracterized.  This book is not a condemnation of African-Americans or of Black Culture.  Nor is \\"blaming the victim\\".  Rather, it is a celebration of the vitality and strength of the African-American people and their culture as the struggle to emerge from the awful history of slavery and racism.  It is a plea for both blacks and whites to honestly consider what our current social and political paradigms have actually wrought and think about how best to really let this vibrant culture and people flourish.  This people that has given so much life, energy, and beauty to world culture and it deserves so much more than the attitudes and politics of limitations and boundaries that exist today.<br />I find this book full of love and caring.  Its exhortations are a plea to something stronger and better rather than a condemnation of people.  It is a view to something beyond and encouragement to the next step rather than continuing a dependency that has a place in the past.<br />The last two chapters on Ebonics (Black English) and the road to equality are truly exceptional.  I expect they will be a kind of expectations test for most people.  I know I started the chapters expecting Dr. McWhorter to take a certain view and was delighted to be shown something I hadn't understood or considered as deeply before I read this wonderful book.<br />Rather than dismiss him out of hand, I think the author deserves the reader's sincere and introspective consideration of the points he makes.  You don't have to agree with him to find a great many rewards in this book.<br />I am grateful to the Dr. McWhorter for his courage in writing it and for the opportunity I have had to read and learn from it.n the past.<br />The last two chapters on Ebonics (Black English) and the road to equality are truly exceptional.

What Mr. Emerson says is alarming without being alarmist. There are people who sympathize with the aims of Islamist radicals living in our country.  The author explains which of these organizations are already HERE and working in this country.  I had no idea that they held conferences in places as seemingly unlikely as Omaha!  In this book we learn that there are many innocent sounding charities that are really front organizations doing fund raising for these groups.  This is being confirmed in daily newspaper articles about this very subject.<br />Mr. Emerson documents what the leaders of these organizations have said and what they have stated their goals to be.  These goals are different than what their public relations people say on their behalf on the various talk shows.  While the book isn't very long, it does contain some very strong stuff.  We don't need to change America into a police state, but we do need heighten our awareness several levels.  This book can help us know more about the threat and what we need to be aware of.  Please read this book.	2003-03-11

It does spend some time on well documented and well known scandals, but the core of the book is the pardons Bill Clinton provided during his last days in office. The extravagantly outrageous pardons of Marc Rich and Pincus Green receive detailed attention.  The author also takes us through the pardons of drug dealers who had ties to the Clintons through relatives and political cronies who also got off.<br />The book details how the Justice Department was circumvented and/or ignored as these pardons were decided on and why Clinton's pardons fall far outside the customary guidelines and procedures for Presidential Pardons.  I particularly enjoyed the summary of the lame excuses and rationalizations provided by Bill and Hillary when the public expressed outrage.  But it saddened me that the Clintons new their supporters could be counted on to forget their outrage and line up behind them again.  Of course, the Clintons know their supporters.<br />The book also provides a good documentation of all the gifts the Clintons shamelessly solicited and received in their last days in office when Hillary had that window as first lady and before she became the junior senator from New York.  Then, with nary a twinge of conscience she said she would vote for legislation that would prevent new senators from engaging in the behavior she was busy completing.  Amazing!<br />It is no secret that the author, who was murdered by terrorists on 9/11 in the jet that was crashed into the Pentagon, had no love or admiration for the Clintons and that most of the readers of this book will also fall into that category.  However, I think that it will provide a nice single volume summary of the Clinton Scandals for those who come later and want to read about the strange presidency of Bill and Hillary Clinton.	2003-02-28

The positions most people hold are already fixed and there isn't much of the ability to hear the other side that is required to have a true discussion. Too often we simply look for writings and speeches that support our pre-existing notions, praise them as we find them, and think to ourselves, &quot;If only the other side would just see as clearly as I and this author do this problem would not exist!&quot;  Or we find an author with whom we disagree and attack him so fiercely because we somehow feel that if we can debase the author we can debase the view with which we disagree.<br />Shelby Steele has been misused in both those ways.  He has chosen a hard road because he writes sincere, thoughtful, and passionate essays that do not merely support or oppose widely held beliefs.  Yes, he is attacked as if he were merely a water carrier for the GOP or praised as if all he were about were attacking affirmative action.  He is far more subtle than this!  Please take the time to read him carefully because there is so much more to gain from his writing, whether or not you end up agreeing with him.<br />This book consists of one very long and three shorter essays.  I hate to summarize the ideas in the essay because they are more thoughtful than any summary I can give and the mere mention of the subjects involved will likely provoke a polarized response to a position already held.  What I will say is that if you force yourself to put aside your already firmly held views ad read these wonderful essays with an open mind, you can find insights that can move you to new thinking and attitudes.<br />The best advice I can give you is to look for how he is challenging your presently held views rather than only noticing how he is challenging those with whom you already disagree.  No matter which part of the political spectrum you currently inhabit, you will find a great deal of challenging and edifying writing here that will provide very nutritious food for thought on this important and sadly painful topic.ovide very nutritious food for thought on this important and sadly painful topic.	2003-02-21

There are many ways to look at organizational culture.  This one gives you a means to measure various aspects and get a view of where you are and where you think you need to be.  It can elicit helpful discussion and real insights into your organization.<br />The book gives helpful background and context for the model (what each quadrant means and doesn't mean), the instrument itself, instructions for administering it, and instructions on how to interpret it.  It also provides a condensed formula for organizational change and helpful hints on how to begin change in each of the quadrants.<br />As we used it in class and our term project it helped us understand the organization our team studied and why it was different than its competitors.  I think Competing Values Framework is a powerful model that is backed by up with a lot of research and can be very useful when used seriously. This is a very helpful book.	2003-02-13

We face so many financial pressures each and every day that we end up spending all (or more than all) we earn.  We can't seem to find any surplus to put away for that far away retirement.  We have to deal with today.<br />But tomorrow comes and we need to face that.  And the sooner the better!  This guide is a good introduction to the basic concepts of the issues that need to be considered when thinking about your future financial needs.  It is especially good as a text for young people to help them form their thinking about the basic issues of earning, spending, and saving and how to plan and control all three.<br />This is NOT detailed or current enough to serve as a guide or manual for financial planning.  This is an introductory text to help you understand some basic concepts and terms.  This guide helps you gain a working vocabulary of the terms and issues involved in preparing for a nice retirement.  It is VERY colorful with many illustrations that add to the text and many which are there as eye candy.	2003-02-07

This small and colorful book is designed as a general introduction to the process and vocabulary of the various taxes we all pay under varying conditions of income and investment.  It is not a current guide to assist you in tax planning.<br />It gives you a basic introduction to the kinds of taxes we pay at the federal and local levels, the IRS, &quot;paying as you earn&quot;, the annual (federal) return (with a nice general overview of the general applicable forms), audits (shiver!), and a little overview of tax planning. But, again, this guide's purpose is to provide a general overview and to provide you with basic concepts and vocabulary.  Think of this as a good introduction to the topic rather than a practical preparation guide and you will understand what this book is trying to do.<br />It has lots of color and every page also uses helpful illustrations of the forms and processes involved in the tax process.  Great for young people trying to learn what they are facing as the goverment(s) remove large chunks of their income to keep us in whatever it is we think we have from the government(s).	2003-02-07

For example, Bush haters will either dislike or like the book depending on how much they perceive the book supporting or condemning Bush. Bush supporters exactly the opposite.<br />3) Over time the book becomes a standard reference.<br />4) As history unfolds, the observations and events described in the book might be refined but are rarely overturned in anything but details.<br />5) Woodward comes out with a new book and the process repeats.<br />This is a most interesting book. Bush comes across as more intelligent, involved, active, and passionate than his media persona is portrayed. This isn't to say he is without flaw, but I like Bush MORE after reading this book.<br />Woodward also carefully details the rifts between the Cheney / Rumsfeld camp versus the Powell / Armitrage camp. This is fascinating stuff. It also gives details about Condi Rice's role in working with Bush as well as the CIA involvement in responding to 9/11. I believe that your judgment about this book should be independent of what you think of the administration's positions, policies, or the people involved. The real question to ask is, \\"Does this book provide us with valuable and reliable information?\\" I think a strong yes can be given.<br />I think everyone interested in these issues, especially at this time of impending war, should read this book. It isn't very long, is clearly written for an easy read, and is fascinating enough to hold one's attention.  Woodward works hard to remain unbiased, but few will be able to read him that way.	2003-02-06

This book is used as part of some introductory courses at the University of Michigan Business School, but I am not sure which ones.  It does have a lot of good information that is explained well and has a great many explanatory graphics - some of which are especially useful.<br />I think the main benefits of this book (and this series) is to become familiar with the vocabulary involved with the topics around money, investing, stocks, bonds, markets, funds, indexes, options, and more.  And learning how to read the various presentations of these instruments in the Wall Street Journal is a big help.  But this book can only be an introductory step.  After you read this book you will know enough to begin studying the various topics, but don't think you will know enough about them to do much more than get yourself in big trouble if you start playing around with much more than mutual funds.<br />But this book will help demystify the terms and processes around equities, bonds, and other instruments.  For this I highly recommend it.  I use it in explaining these topics to folks who want to begin learning about the issues surrounding investing.	2003-02-05

But we can rejoice that we still have her wonderful books.  This book is among her best.  It is almost magical in the way she and David Freidel create the atmosphere of the Mayan culture.  There are wonderful pictures and illustrations.  She unfolds the stories of the archaeological discoveries and then helps us understand the real lives revealed in the evidence.<br /><br />The book also shows how the Mayan glyphs and counting systems work.  There are nowadays very good texts on the writing system itself, but this book shows us how the glyphs are woven into the culture and religion of these people.  We learn how the lineage worked and how the monuments were used as what we would call propaganda to support one line over other possibilities.  We learn about the role of magic and visions and the way the leaders were the empowered by those visions.<br /><br />There is just so much here that any reader will be richly rewarded.  The Mayan civilization is incredibly fascinating because it is so foreign to our own and yet it is a part of the heritage of the American continents.<br /><br />This book isn't just a text, it is a work of art in itself.  You will have a hard time putting it down.	2003-02-04

He accused Alger Hiss (and others) of spying for the Soviet Union and claims he knew that it was true because he was himself a communist spy and was Hiss's contact. But that story, while a part of this book, isn't the sole focus of this magnificent book. You can read the story of the trials of Alger Hiss, the testimony given, and more about that story in Allen Weinstein's very fine \\"Perjury\\" (a book which also arouses strong emotions).<br />The story of Chambers' life is also told by Chambers himself in his powerful autobiography \\"Witness\\". His life is a rather involved tale, and though the spy story is why Chambers became famous (infamous) it isn't reason why he is important. It is hard to recapture the vast esteem in which Stalin and the Soviet Union were held by the \\"literate\\" classes in American Society. But it doesn't take too much reading to peel back current revisionist writing that pretends the left rejected Stalin.  It wasn't so.  They loved Uncle Joe at the time of the Hiss case and made apologies for him even after the horrors of the Gulag were revealed.  Even after Hiss' guilt has been proven beyond all but the most determined and self-blinded doubt, you can find those who insist on his innocence.<br />Whittaker Chambers was a gifted writer and a well regarded editor at Henry Luce's Time magazine. When he admitted his role in spying for the USSR and International Communism it represented the initial break in the dam.  In \\"Witness\\", Chambers' autobiography, Chambers describes the agony he went through in realizing he had no choice but to take the course of trying to stop Hiss and thereby ruining his own life and irreparably harming his family.<br />Chambers was pessimistic about the West surviving a mortal struggle with Communism. He is often linked with McCarthy, but he thought McCarthy's recklessness more of a benefit to the other side.<br />\\"Witness\\" was an important best seller and is still in print. In it Chambers pours out his conscience and how his atheism turned to a deep faith and why that turned him against the movement he had embraced and had helped prosper through his gifts as a writer and editor.In this amazing book.<br />In this wonderful biography,  Tanenhaus gives us context for all of this and so much more detail.  The author also provides verification (and refutation) of claims made by and about Chambers. This book is beautifully written and carefully researched. The author shows great judgment and insight into all of the issues involved in this rich life at the extremes of human philosophy.<br />It is wrong to condemn this book and its author because of anger with Chambers. It is beyond all doubt that the thrust of Chambers' story was the truth. In my judgement, it is the truth in all but a few details. Tanenhaus is the reporter of fact and wishes that reality were different cannot change the facts. What is the old saying? You are entitled to your own interpretations, but not your own facts.<br />We owe Tanenhaus a great deal for putting such wonderful talent and years of hard work in giving us this outstanding book.

Mr. Posner has given us a well-written and most enjoyable book that has a clear-eyed affection for its subject. The book captures the magic of the early years, the painful maturity as artists decided to leave Motown, the meandering later years, and the eventual and multiple sales of Motown to different entities. The stories are told with enthusiasm and the accomplishments are given the praise deserved, but Mr. Posner doesn't flack for any personality or viewpoint. In fact, he often presents multiple points of view of some events so the reader can decide where the truth is likely to be hiding.<br />Since this isn't a book of encyclopedic length, it has to focus on certain key points and that means a lot gets left out. And though many artists contributed to Motown's fabulous accomplishments, the book centers on Berry Gordy, Jr., his founding of the company, how he gathered all that amazing talent, and how Motow provided an environment where that talent could develop and flourish.<br />The book also focuses on the biggest acts and on those employees who were closest to Gordy. Necessarily, a lot of talented and wonderful people get left out of this telling of the story. THe book is just over 300 pages and it would take thousands of pages to tell something approaching a complete history of Motown. However, this book is delightful to read and gets those of us without inside knowledge closer to these personalities than many of us have every been.<br />There are so many different and passionate views about who deserves credit for what in all the successes of Motown and who deserves blame for all the various failures that no book can satisfy everyone. However, Mr. Posner has done a great deal to talk to as many folks as would talk with him, did a lot of reading, and dug into court records to find out what really went on. He found out a lot about the truth of the charges and counter charges in key court cases and business practices that existed in Motown over the decades of its existence. The book takes an even handed view and isn't afraid to tell us about Mr. Gordy's rather sharp business practices, the self-delusion and self-destruction of many artists, as well as the glorious way they pulled together in the early years to make themselves into huge stars. The book isn't a puff piece, but it also doesn't drag the people discussed in the book through the mud.<br />If you haven't already made up your mind, I think you will enjoy this book very much.

Not only is it a great story in its own right, the authors were able to put together the facts of the story in an incredibly lively and detailed way.  They paint this story on a big enough canvas to let a large cast of incredible characters act out their part in this amazing saga.<br />The easy larger than life characters are Ross Johnson, Henry Kravis, George Roberts, Peter Cohen, and maybe even Ted Forstmann, but there are so many more.  There were so many times a deal could have been put together and most likely should have been, but in each instance it slipped away because one ego or another wanted to carve its initials in the bark of what was then the largest deal in history.<br />For those of us who are interested in how business really works, this is one of the epics in business history.  It begins with the founding of the companies involved and the rather amazing story of how Ross Johnson ended up at the helm of RJR Nabisco.  The book also gives plenty of evidence of Wall Streeters seeking out their own interest over their clients' needs and desires and contrary to their own promises and assurances.  You will become convinced of the aptness of Ross Johnson's adage about the rules of behavior on Wall Street: &quot;Never play by the rules, never tell the truth, and never pay in cash&quot;.<br />Another of the many things I enjoyed about this book is that the personalities of the major and secondary characters are given enough room to become more than just stick figures.  There are times you will want to support them, when you will root for them, when you will be appalled by their behavior and ego, and other times you will laugh until your sides hurt.  This isn't a simple story drawn with stick figures.  If you want to understand American business, this is one of the stories you simply have to know.<br />While the movie made from this book is quite good and very funny, it doesn't offer you the full range of characters involved nor the detail of the actual negotiations and how the deal finally came to its strange end.  The movie captures the mood and the essentials of the story and that might be enough for most.  I recommend the movie for those who want the story in broad strokes.  However, if you want to really gain an understanding of how this deal in particular and how business deals in general really come together and fall apart, the book is the way to go.  The people involved become more three dimensional in the book and where some events and characters are left out or compressed in the movie the book has the room to let the story be told more fully.  It isn't that the book is the ultimate truth (I am sure every person involved could point to things they find inadequate in the book), it is that the authors dug hard, got as much of the truth as they could get to and shared it with us in an intelligent, enlightening and often humorous way.<br />This is a great book I would recommend to anyone, but it is a must read for students of business.s involved nor the detail of the actual negotiations and how the deal finally came to its strange end.

As everyone points out, this is written as a novel and therefore dresses up its points and teaches through the story of a manger of a failing manufacturing plant and a workaholic also failing in marriage.<br />You can guess that the protagonist learns / discovers Goldratt's Theory of Constraints and everything in his life turns around.  Even though all this is obvious, it is a decent read and although much of it has aged (smoking and drinking at work, not many women in the workplace, no cell phones, etc), and even though other ideas have come along developing or moving past TOC, it still is an important source text.  If you are interested in manufacturing and the ideas that have affected manufacturing for the past decade and a half, this book is a must read.<br />The basic notion is that traditional cost accounting measures can distort and therefore misrepresent costs and therefore cause behavior to work against firm profitability.  The TOC basically treats all costs as fixed (in the short term) and forces managers to think through and re-design their system for maximum throughput.<br />This is a good book, a good text, and an important historical document of the mid-eighties that still has influence today.  If you haven't read it, hey, it's still new, right?  You'll be glad you read it even if you adopt some other manufacturing point of view.  At least you will be better prepared to discuss TOC when it comes up in conversation with other manufacturing / cost accounting types.	2002-12-31

He largely succeeded.<br />This book shows the deals he cut with rather awful people and Hammer's, being kind, questionable character.  It is an engrossing story and the book is a great read.<br />The point is that this is an important story because of the relationships Hammer had with people in power in the Soviet Union, in the Middle East, and in Washington.  Occidental Petroleum was and is an important company.  Of course, Al Gore's father success, and much of Gore's personal wealth, is based upon carrying water for Occidental Petroleum.  The company worked hard in post Hammer times to erase that difficult past.  You can judge for yourself.<br />I believe that you will enjoy this book and warmly recommend it to you.	2002-12-29

However, a surprising number have.  Some were sold while others evolved one way or the other.  It is quite an interesting to read about how these businesses viewed their markets at the height of the boom and then look at how things are today.<br />I think the book has a couple of good points to make.  These sites were not funded by huge amounts of venture capital.  They are all small sites that have done well for people who had a specific expertise, who thought small in a tightly focused way, and who used the web to broaden their reach to a proven client base.<br />There are thousands of successful sites just like these and this type of thing can be done thousands of more times by intelligent business people.  My advice, however, is that unless you really KNOW what your plan and goals are, don't spend your hard earned cash until you are certain you have minimized your uncertainties.  Of course, to be an entrepreneur is to have more risk than regular folks are willing to take on.  But spend more time getting ready and learning your business rather than recklessly diving in head first to see how deep the pond is.  If you don't you could end up spending a lot of money on a website that will be nothing but a drain on your precious cash and time.	2002-12-28

This autobiography tells the story of the McCain men from the Senator's grandfather and his important role in WWII and standing on the deck of the USS Missouri during the ceremony of the surrender of Japan.  They named a destroyer after him.<br />It also tells the story of the Senator's father and his career, which reached its peak when he was appointed CINPAC (Commander In Chief - Pacific).  He had the operational command of aspects of the Vietnam War.  His character is shown when he responded to duty by calling air strikes on Hanoi while his son (Senator McCain) was a prisoner there.<br />The book also tells us about Senator McCain's youth and academic carelessness, but also shares with us the heroism of the prisoners of war in Hanoi and how they survived.  He tells us of his own ordeal, but in more reserved tones than a third party biography would.  He does reveal deep emotion towards certain of his captors who were responsible for sadistic torture.<br />This is a very moving book and while people feel differently about Senator McCain's politics, we should all be grateful to the McCain family for their generations of dedication and for the Senator's personal sacrifice for our country.<br />It is a VERY good read and a very moving story.  Five stars.	2002-12-21

O'Rourke spares no one, especially not himself, in his sharp and funny observations on life, politics, culture, more politics, and family.  I like his writing.  Humor is a risky and delicate thing because it depends so much on knowing the reality behind the joke.  For example, I am sure that there are many hysterical jokes that, oh, glass blowers tell among themselves that would elude me completely.<br />O'Rourke has the knack of being able to find the universal in some rather arcane scenery - like the bureaucrats in India, and has a lot of fun with wine tasting and altering the senses in general.  He also likes to tee off on both of our political parties, though, being a Republican there seems to be more glee in his hammering on the Democrats (or maybe my being conservative and Republican, I get more glee from his pounding on the other guys.  But I must admit to relishing his exposing the hypocrisy on the right as well.).<br />This book is a collection of his published articles (at least one unpublished before) that are woven (pasted - pastiched?) together as if they came out of events in O'Rourke's life rather being set up as separate articles.  This device works OK and offers the P.J. the opportunity the opportunity of setting up a few more laughs.<br />I am sure you will enjoy some articles more than others, as I did.  Again, humor is a difficult thing and sometimes you find yourself outside the point of the joke.  But there are plenty enough delicious barbs that you will find yourself laughing out loud more than few times.  It ends in August of 2001 so it comes from the pre-9/11 world and that shows a bit.  But, hey, it is still very good stuff.<br />Four stars: while it is very good writing, it isn't the best O'Rourke - but it is still far better than most other satirical commentary.	2002-12-19

The story of the Spanish Conquest of Mexico through Cortez is unbelievably compelling.  Even so, Mr. Thomas writes brilliantly and tells this story better than I have ever seen, read, or heard it done.  He brings life to all of the characters along the way including those that came before Cortez, those that he met and made allies along the way, those he turned into enemies, and especially Montezuma.  The final battle for Tenochtitlan is frightening and heartbreaking.<br />This is history that reads like fiction.  The world of Mexico before the Conquistadors is so foreign to the Western mind that it reads almost like fiction or fantasy.  Yet it all happened, and Mr. Thomas tells it with power and passion.  This is a book you owe it to yourself to read.  Just amazing and wonderful.	2002-12-12

He has contributed so much to our understanding of the effects of monetary policy and has been such a tireless advocate for freedom that I must admit I am not impartial in any way, so readers beware.<br />This book examines 10 different episodes in world history in which seemingly trivial policy choices towards money had profound, unexpected, and unforeseen consequences (usually very bad).  They make enjoyable reading and are most educational.<br />The discussions are not all that technical and, to me, sparkle with wit and insight.  This book can serve as a great introduction to how gold and silver money was abused, the effect that minting rights can have, how technology changes in mining precious metals caused a crisis of devaluation, what the heck bimetallism is and what the issues around it were (are), and most important, the risks of the kind of money we have (fiat money - because it is not tied explicitly to some kind of commodity and is therefore at the risk of somebody running the printing press too much).  This is all great stuff.  Enjoy!<br />There are several useful graphs and tables.  Also, a reference list in the back can act as a bibliography for further reading.	2002-12-08

Most of them are collected from his writings in the Harvard Business Review although two are new to this book.  Think of this as a &quot;Porter's Greatest Hits&quot; kind of thing.  That is a bit misleading because his HBR articles are not exactly the same thing as his Competitive Advantage books although the topics are definitely related.<br />The essays are grouped into three broad sections: 1) Competition and Strategy: Core Concepts, 2) The Competitiveness of Locations, and 3) Competitive Solutions to Societal Problems.  Will you find each article of the same high quality?  Probably not (again, like a greatest hits collection), but you will find them informative and thought provoking.  It is impossible to study for an MBA nowadays without invoking &quot;Porter's Five Forces&quot; in your discussions of competitive and marketing strategy.<br />This book can help add to your thinking and understanding of how every aspect of our life is in some way part of a competitive context and the ways it improves our standard of living.  It will also help you improve your thinking in how to best strategize for and participate in competitive situations.<br />It would be a mistake to think that Porter advocates for a Hobbesian nightmare of life being nasty, brutish and short.  Rather, he is more or less helping us think through the nature of the way competition arises and how to best think about its sources and how to manage it and the traps to avoid.<br />While Porter's model is used by some as a hammer that sees everything as a nail, it really needn't be used that way and, in its proper context, is very helpful.	2002-12-07

He is presented as a person rather than as a marble statue.  While there is some approach to showing us the magnitude of his intellectual achievements the explations provided do not burdent the non-specialist with the heavy load of having to understand Newton's actual work.<br /><br />This biography doesn't shy away from that portion of Newton's thought that our thinking about science would find troubling today.  There are many topics of investigation that Newton took seriously that anyone trained in present-day science would find more than odd (alchemy and bibal prophecy to name two).  However, this is one of the facts of intellectual investigation as it exists throughout history.  Remember Hegel includes Phrenology as a serious topic in his magnum opus \\"Phenomenology of the Mind\\".<br /><br />The living generation always views itself as modern and the sum of all human thought.  It is hard to visualize how foolish we will seem to our descendents nor can we know for sure what aspects of our science or which of our \\"truths\\" will be overthrown by our children or their grandchildren.  But we can rest assured the learning and forgetting will continue in the future as it has throughout all time.<br /><br />What is stunning is how much of Newton is still absolutely relevant today.  Of all the books in print today most will crumble to dust and be forgotten.  In three hundred years Newton's \\"Principia\\" will still be in print and revered.  Few minds can claim that kind of priority.<br /><br />This book is a nice introduction and would be especially nice for students and anyone who would like to know the basics about Newton's life and work.  It is a good launching pad for a more serious investigation in the work of one of the intellectual titans of human history.	2002-12-07

While this book isn't nearly as funny or witty as &quot;Liar's Poker&quot;, it wasn't ever intended to be.  This is solid and intelligent reporting (such as the limitations of reporting are).  Here is the story of how a company almost no one outside its very specialized community knew nearly sank the global economy.  How can this not be fascinating?<br />The problem is that the financial instruments they were dealing in are not commonly understood and are not easy to grasp without some training or careful study.  Most of the simplistic explanations in the papers and on (worse) TV seem to add more heat than light.<br />All I can tell you is that Mr. Lowenstein has done a pretty good job at making this rather abstruse subject as accessible as can be while still trying to really tell the story rather than waving his arms and making extravagant and pejorative claims.<br />Just two of the things you will see raised in this book that differ from what you will read in the popular press are: 1) Greenspan was more or less co-opted into bailing out LTCM and had very different views and considerations about letting the company fail than has been popularly reported, and, 2) there is some evidence that the debacle of LTCM's failure was made worse by their being the victim of front-running.  That is, someone who knew what they had to sell got in front of those sales to undermine their position.<br />I'll let you read the book and make up your own mind rather than my making arguments for what are really only my impressions from reading this book.  It is only 236 pages, but what a read! (Four stars because it is so specialized, but it is a VERY GOOD book.)	2002-12-02

What an incredible resource!  I bought this book because it was on the suggested reading list for a course on Corporate Control I took in the MBA program at the University of Michigan b-school.  Yes, it is almost 900 pages long.  Yes, some of the stories could use a bit of updating because of the recent events at places like Tyco and Worldcom.  But so what?  It is nice to have on record how people used to think and talk about these businesses and their CEOs.<br />That little tiny caveat aside it is important to focus on everything you get in this really neat book.  You get a history of the different waves of the M&amp;A process throughout history, how it has evolved, the way it has developed in different industries and market sectors, and a rather nice analysis (in the broadest strokes) of what goes in planning and executing these deals.<br />Throughout the book there are wonderful spotlights on the principle people in the history of M&amp;A and little synopses of the more famous and important precedent setting deals.  This aspect of the book is incredibly valuable.  In order to make sense of what we read about in the paper about mergers and acquisitions we need to know how we got here.  This book provides an incredible amount of wonderful background material.  Some complain that the book is long.  I think it is amazing that he has put so much in only 900 pages.  Amazingly compact!<br />Mr. Wassertein, one of the industries movers and shakers (currently running Lazard), has organized this book in twenty-three chapters that are grouped in three large sections: (1) Past as Prelude, (2) The Strategic Challenge, and (3) Doing the Deal.  Plus there is a nice bibliography (also grouped in according to these three sections) that can lead to further reading on the topics of interest to you.  The index is also quite useful because this book can be used for reference in looking up or reviewing specific topics.<br />Yes, reading this book front to back is a great read, but you cannot remember it all the first time through.  It is useful to be able to dive into specific deals, people, and topics.  The author has put this book together in a thoughtful and helpful way.<br />If you want scandal and gossip, well, this book really isn't for you.

It is a collection of Mr. Friedman's columns plus his unpublished diary.  It begins a few months before Sept 11, 2001 through mid-2002 and is grouped in pre- and post 9/11.<br />Op-ed columnists have an interesting problem.  On one had they only have to put together 800 or so words to make one piece.  However, putting something important in a small space can be hard work if the writer takes the job seriously (less serious columnists find the op-ed real estate large - they tease a nothing idea into 800 empty words).<br />Then there is the problem of having to write opinions in close to real time.  Events force you to re-think your views and yet you have all that previously published stuff that seems to contradict what you are presently saying.  Almost by definition the experiences of life provide new perspectives and a change of context.  It is hard to be alive and not change your understanding of things.  So, collecting one's opinions over time may provide apparent inconsistencies and changes, but it is more about deeper understanding and new appreciation of things.<br />Thomas L. Friedman is a very good columnist because he is a keen observer of events in our world.  He writes seriously and with passion.  He actually cares what he is writing about.  He is courageous in stating what he thinks should be done by the parties involved and this leads to another risk:  people who agree with him one day might be furious with him the next.<br />But all this is just fine.  I find myself appreciating the author's observations and most of his analysis.  However, I find most myself disagreeing with many of recommendations.  Again, this is great.  He provides me with ideas and insights that are worth considering.  It isn't necessary to agree with him to find him valuable.  The value is in giving us substantive and worthwhile material to think over and consider.<br />You may have read many or most of the columns before, but they have a different effect when bound and then read one after the other.  It is tough to write columns that hold up over time.  Mr. Friedman does that for us better than most.  And that is why I recommend this book.nt effect when bound and then read one after the other.

We have all seen and been deeply affected by the pages and pages of short biographies (and pictures) of those who perished on September 11, 2001 in the Twin Towers, the Pentagon, and aboard the hijacked planes.  This wonderful book is about one of those people, his best friend, David Hill, and his last wife and soul-mate, Susan.<br />I didn't know the name of Rick Rescorla, although I have since found that I have a friend who fought with him at Ia Drang and thinks highly of him.  When I heard the news stories describing a man who had been a hero in that battle and then died saving others on 9/11 I wanted to read more about him.  I think you not only enjoy this book, you will be moved by his story.<br />It isn't a fairy tale, but it reads like one.  Here is a poor kid from Cornwall, UK who heads to Africa to fight, becomes friends with an American soldier.  He then joins the US Army, fights in Vietnam, becomes a US citizen.  His life ends in the fall of the South Tower.<br />Mr. Rescorla's life, like ours, had its peaks and valleys.  He was a hero, no doubt about it.  But he also had parts of his life that didn't work out as well as he had hoped with ordinary failings (again, just like us).  The difference is, that when the call came, he heard the call to duty, and putting others first, went back into the building when he could have gotten out.  In doing so, he perished.  As you read this book it will be clear why.<br />What is especially nice about this book is that the reason you will know why he tried to save others isn't a comic book version of heroism.  It isn't just Mr. Rescorla's nobility and intrinsic heroism, though there is plenty of that in my view.  It also came out of his own sense of who he was and his sense of what he needed to do.<br />He likely wouldn't have survived even if he had \\"lived\\".  If those he was charged with protecting perished it would have been nearly impossible for him to live with that.  He had to try and save them just as he had done in other places and in other times.  What was an amazing man.<br />Mr. Stewart always writes well.  I especially like the way he talks about the heroic, the ordinary, and the whacky in elegant and clear prose.  He doesn't cue how you are supposed to feel about this or that aspect of Mr. Rescorla's life or the lives of his friends and family.  Mr. Stewart tells the story and its internal power communicates through the author's effective prose.<br />Pointing out Mr. Rescorla's heroism doesn't in any way detract from the hundreds of heros who gave their lives that day also trying to save others.  This story just makes one of those heros more real for those of us who weren't directly involved.<br />This is a story you will not want to put down.done in other places and in other times.

The most important thing to keep in mind while reading this book is that its subject, Michael Swango, is a serial killer.  He is an aberration.  That being said, the idea of medical care professionals being killers is a nightmare that our medical system has to make even more impossible and rare.<br />Mr. Stewart shows how Swango was abetted by the system's clubby nature to protect its own against charges and suites, how he used the desperation of the more outlying medical facilities for doctors, and how psychopaths can charm and persuade those around them that the evidence to the contrary, their eyes are deceiving them.<br />This is a good read, but in some ways a very difficult one.  It is interesting and compelling and yet it feels like being caught in a horrifying dream.  Just as hard cases make bad law, these rare but horrible events make us want to do something, anything, in order to allow us to believe this could never happen again.  But the reality is killers kill.<br />There are things the medical establishment could and should do in order to better weed out bad doctors, nurses, and others who staff our health care system.  But to think in terms of a major restructuring in order to avoid something so extremely rare is as unrealistic as doing nothing.<br />The book ends with the possibility that Swango would be released a few months from the publication date.  However, Swango has since pleaded guilty to four murders in order to avoid the death penalty and extradition to Zimbabwe.  So, he is in prison for four consecutive life sentences.  Thank heaven for that!<br />If this topic is interesting to you this is a very good book.  But be prepared for reading about a very sick person and the horrible things he did to innocent and trusting people.	2002-11-15

Each was short and combined they still make for easy and delightful reading.  The idea is that each book (you life, your love life, your financial life) provides a sardonic set of rules to ensure failure in misery in your life.  For example, the very first rule in ruining your life is, \\"Don't Learn Any Useful Skills\\".  This does seem an effective way to ensure misery doesn't it?  The author then provides some commentary on the most effective ways to implement such a rule and the salutary effects it will have in helping ensure a ruined life.<br /><br />The first rule in \\"How to Ruin Your Love Life\\" has been proven out in countless failed marriages and can be attested to by reading almost any divorce transcript you can find.  The rule is, \\"Know That You Wishes Are the Only Ones That Matter In Any Situation.\\"  I am sure you have seen it applied in the lives of unhappy people you know and can attest that this rule can ensure the inability to form any long-term relationships that are actually long term.<br /><br />And the first rule for ruining your financial life is \\"Forget About Tomorrow\\".  You can see how this applies, I am sure.  You should not only spend all you have today, you should borrow against tomorrow to have fun today.  Yep, that will work.<br /><br />So, each of these sections provides dozens of rules that can help the thoughtful think through their present actions and course of life and compare their behavior to these rules and see why things might be working out well or not.  Sometimes the biting contrarian way of saying things helps us see more clearly than the sometimes too sweet way of saying things positively.  Mr. Stein not only provides good advice in this inverse way, he make it funny as well.<br /><br />Highly recommended and can make a great gift to the right son or daughter.  Of course, it is the ones who need it less who will actually read it.  As soon as I got it, my two youngest children, both teenagers, grabbed it from me and started going through it.

Dr. Pipes makes the very helpful point that Islamism is NOT Islam.  It is a political movement, totalitarian and utopian in nature, that drapes itself with Islam.  However, he also points out the real danger facing the United States from this movement.<br />The Author also helps us understand the magnitude of the problem.  There are a billion Muslims in the world.  A few tens of thousands are members of active groups working against the West.  But there are another hundred million or so who actively support their goals with up to a half a billion sympathetic to their views.  This is a serious issue and Dr. Pipes carefully takes us through a wide range of issues helping us understand this urgent reality.<br />While Dr. Pipes is often attacked personally by critics sympathetic to the Islamist movements, when you take the time to read these essays you will see that he takes Islam seriously and analyzes carefully.  Yes, Dr. Pipes supports the west and the United States.  Yes, he is advocating political positions and actions that he believes will be best for America to protect its interests.  But along with this he is a serious scholar and I believe he has done us a great service by putting out this book.<br />You will know more about the situation we face and its constituent parts after reading this book.  And that is a lot.  It is certainly more than you get from many books on the middle east that generate a lot more heat than light.	2002-11-03

While that is always intersting, this book is a serious treatment of what the venture capital business is about: how funds are raised, how venture capitalists arrange deals to ensure adequate compensation for their risk, how investments are staged, how the investments are managed, exit strategies and methods, and more.<br />This is a lot to cover in a book of approximately 350 pages, but it is all covered very well.  The writing is quite clear and readable.  Though this is not a book for the general reader, it is not difficult to read if you have some background understanding of business theory and a touch of finance.<br />What is so helpful about reading this book is that people seeking venture capital will understand more about why things are structured they way they are.  It isn't just arbitrary greed and control.  It is a business deal that requires an expected positive return - you know - making money (which does concern self-interest (greed) and structure (control) - but with slightly more reasoning).<br />While people seeking to make venture investments will immediately understand why they need something like this book and a whole lot more, I believe it is essential for people seeking investment money to also have a significant understanding of this process.  Why?  Because the venture capitalists understand this process completely and the people seeking investments usually don't do enough of these deals to really know what is going on.  And if they are too blind they will be sheared like sheep.  They need to understand all the interests involved so they can argue on their own behalf and make the deal as favorable as they can.<br />In any case, while this isn't the only book you should read on the subject it is certainly a good one.  It is of manageable length with a great deal of clear and helpful information. I find this topic fascinating.length with a great deal of clear and helpful information.

Mr. Tropman helps make explicity all the implicit components of employee compensation.  There are many aspects to the employer - employee relationship that are either valued or borne by each side of the relationship.<br />Mr. Tropman shows how thinking clearly about what he calls indirect pay, works pay, and perks pay can help employers and employees fit the job better and fit the total compensation value better to the employee. In this way both sides better understand the ways they are each gaining benefits and bearing costs through the work being done by a given employee.<br />It never claims to be a one size fits all panacea. Rather, it is a helpful model that aids clearer thinking and discussion.	2002-10-28

Yes, they are part of the same topic, but they have somewhat different emphases.  This book covers costs, but it is really more focused on how you allocated decision rights, set measurement criteria, and how you reward people to get the behavior you want.  It is also very helpful in clarifying thinking about what could be going wrong if you aren't getting the behavior you wanted out of a given system of measurement and reward.<br />The writing is very good and the organization of the book is sound and helpful.  While there are charts and graphs it is not a book full of color and pictures.  It is a book with words and ideas that are helpfully supplemented as needed.  But the self-study problems and cases are set off from the main text by being on different color pages.  This helps in locating what you are after.<br />There is a wealth of thought provoking problems and short cases to help promote discussion and provoke your thinking on the topics discussed in each chapter.<br />Another aspect of the book I really like are the concept questions in each chapter that help you gauge your understanding of what you have just read.  The solutions for these are provided in the back of the book so you can know if you are &quot;getting it&quot; or not.<br />This is a fine and very useful text.	2002-10-24

Horngren Series in Accounting)	Books	5	19	20	N	N	A standard text for cost accounting	If you are looking for a single volume &quot;bible&quot; on cost accounting, this is likely the best book in print today to fit that bill.  It is comprehensive in scope yet has many strengths to ease comprehension and aid readability.<br />The topics are grouped in six main sections each with several chapters on that topic.  Since it is unlikely that you will read this reference / text book left to right as you would a novel this organization helps in finding what you are looking for and focusing on the area(s) of interest.<br />There are many helpful illustrations and a good use of color as well as chapter summaries and all the exercises you could ever hope for.<br />A very excellent feature is the use of application problems that take you step-by-step through building an Excel spreadsheet. This is tremendously useful.<br />The web support is also a good help as well as the streaming video vignettes.<br />I honestly find this topic very interesting and the 11th edition of this book to be a very valuable resource.	2002-10-24

First and foremost, this is a fun book to read. It is funny, informative, insightful, and yet sincere enough that you can forgive him longing for a sunset over the Pacific which is, of course, impossible in New South Wales; ah well ...<br /><br />I knew nothing about Bill Bryson until a friend of mine loaned me this book. My friend assures me that all of Bryson's writing is of this caliber and just as much fun. It seems likely that this is true.<br /><br />From 1973-75 I was fortunate enough to live in Queensland and this book resonates well with my experiences from so long ago, if nicely updated. Australians (Aussies - pronounced Auzzies - NOT! with an s sound) are simply wonderful people. I am glad the Bryson points out their openness and friendly exuberance. He was fortunate enough to travel throughout the continent while I lived in a few towns up and down the coast of a really delightful place.<br /><br />Queenslanders are usually and falsely cast as backward or \\"mad as cut snakes\\" (as they are here). Queensland itself is often referred to in a patronizing way, for example, being given the nickname \\"Cinderella state\\". But my experience of it was not like that at all. Yes, the more rural places lacked the infrastructure of urban places (as do all rural spaces - it is sort of the definition isn't it?) and in 1973 Brisbane was still a smallish city and felt it. But when I was able to travel there in 1995 on business, Brisbane had become a gleaming and very modern city. And in New South Wales, Sydney is utterly beautiful with delights all around you.<br /><br />Anyway, Bryson gives you the flavor of many places in this vast continent (it is bigger than the 48 states of the US). He specializes in the out of the way, but manages to find things that really do tie into the history and fabric of the place. Bryson has a real talent for this and makes it all seem easy and light, but it is hard work to write like that.<br /><br />I recommend this book highly to everyone who is thinking of visiting this wonderful place and to everyone who wishes they could get there. Heck, even to those who know nothing of the place and think they might like to learn something more than kangaroos and koalas!<br /><br />It is a breezy read that you can get through rather quickly while learning more than you suspect.

It had deep roots in prior events such as the 1993 bombing of the WTC, the embassy bombings in Africa, the counter attacks in Somalia, and, of course, the attack on our warship The Cole.<br />In fact, according to the book, it goes back even further.  But I won't go into the books entire thesis here.  I will tell you that I think you will get a lot from this book.  While I certainly am not one of those who is interested in the blame game for 9/11 or thinking that we should be able to guarantee protection from any other possible attacks in the future, I do think this book demonstrates clearly how bureaucratic group think, inter-agency turf wars, and the cross-purposes of the diplomatic corps, the justice apparatus, and intelligence gathering can create exploitable vulnerabilities.<br />The writing is pretty good and at times compelling.  I think it could have used a bit more editing to smooth things out a bit, but that isn't a significant weakness.  The reason I gave this book four stars instead of five is that the only picture of the relevant people we get is a fuzzy shot on the dust jacket.  The book would be twice as valuable with a few pictures of the main players in the story.  Especially since there are a lot of names to keep straight.  But the book is valuable enough without them.  I recommend it highly and encourage everyone to read and think about it.<br />Feel free to email me with your thoughts on the book after you have read it.  I think you will find it stimulating and disturbing, and will make more clear for you what is going on within our government to create more alignment of purpose and the tearing down of bureaucratic fences.  At least, if we don't get that done, you will understand why we are still in big trouble!	2002-10-06

The most valuable is to provide the student with sufficient challenge to stimulate passionate thinking so the student develops a framework to use in not only comprehending the topic at hand, but also ready for use in further intellectual development.  Even to the point of being able to rebuild the framework itself as life experience stimulates reconsideration.<br />Bloom is a great teacher and it is hard for me to find the words to explain how grateful I am for this book.<br />I should start off by saying what it is not.  Even though it discusses each of the 39 plays it is not at all a compendium surveying the plays.  This is a book with a specific thesis and discusses the plays in terms of that thesis.  The idea, if I understand Bloom correctly, is that Shakespeare's understanding of the human creature; the nature of our lives as human creatures, combined with Shakespeare's preternatural artistic gifts has actually changed our understanding of what it is to be human.<br />Like all truly great artists, what we think of them says nothing about the artist, but everything about us.  Shakespeare is such a potent cultural influence that he informs the lives of those who have never heard of him, who have never read his plays, and even those who don't speak a syllable of English.<br />Bloom has read so widely and so deeply that he has much to share with us.  I am glad for his courage to speak against the fashions of our time and to tell the truth about our post-literate stage of thinking.  However, feel free to disagree with him (and especially with me).  Bloom also is keenly aware of what the great critics have written about Shakespeare and uses that to also explicate his thesis and inform us of the range of understanding and interpretation of this magnificent art.<br />I won't quibble with those who say that Bloom isn't the greatest prose writer.  However, I will say (with some admitted overstatement in the comparison) that many have pointed out the awkwardness of Beethoven's vocal writing.  That is to say, the music is so great and so transcendent it is really up to the vocalist to adapt.  And while Bloom certainly isn't a Beethoven, he is certainly valuable enough a writer (because he is such a glorious reader) that we should be willing to adapt ourselves to his style and get past the little things that bother us.  We don't want to miss the important stuff because of the lint in the creases.<br />Do I agree with everything Bloom says?  Who could?  I certainly haven't read enough nor could I pretend to understand enough to talk in terms of disagreement.  There are things I would ask about if I were in a class with him.  There would be ideas I would challenge with the expectation that he would have a reservoir to call on that could easily drown my questioning.  And I would learn.  Which is the point after all.<br />This book will inspire you to more and deeper reading and will provide you foot and hand holds into these plays that you might not have had before (I didn't).  There isn't an index because it really isn't needed here.  These are really essays about each play in terms of Bloom's larger thesis.  It isn't a reference book or a history book about the plays.<br />I read some other books to get ready to read this book.  Of course, there is so much here that no amount of preparation can really provide a complete background.  So, I guess my advice is to jump in.

1412038:US	53052943	R2S6IGKST8HX6	0385152132	948735718	The Complete Poetry & Prose of William Blake	Books	5	49	50	N	N	An essential book with the words of a great writer and poet	This is an essential book for those of us who love William Blake for his words as well as for his engravings, drawings, and paintings.<br />I hardly knew anything about Blake before I made several trips to London on business in 1995 - 96. When I began to see his work (for example, at the Tate - now Tate Britain) I was deeply moved. I read the wonderful biography by Ackroyd that was just then published and began to collect affordable editions of the illustrated works.<br />Later, I became aware of this book and purchased it as well. It is very affordable and contains many wonderful things in addition to the primary writings of Blake. For example, we also get Blake's annotations of other writers' works, some of his letters, and textual notes. On the downside, there are a only a few black and white illustrations. This is a book for thinking about Blake's WORDS.<br />Yes, by definition the illuminated works really do require the illustrations to be complete, but it is hard to meditate and think about just the words without being distracted by those amazing drawings. (Princeton University Press publishes fabulous editions of the illuminated works in paperback.) By all means spend a great deal of time with the illuminated works and you will be richly rewarded, but spending time with the words apart is also very wonderful and very helpful.<br />The always rewarding Harold Bloom also provides extended commentary on many of the works in the back of the book.<br />Please put this book in your library and on your shelf - AFTER you read it. Then take it off again to drink of these great words over and over again.	2002-09-11

Books	4	22	23	N	N	Very good text for introducing Blake to students	This is a book is quite good as most Norton Critical Editions are.  It has a lot of what is needed by students for a course on Blake or, more likely, a course that spends part of a term on Blake.<br />It has some biographical material and some maps of England and London at the time Blake lived.  There are also a good helping of black and white as well as color plates of Blake's illuminated works.  The color plates are only good - the color is not produced beautifully.  The student will only get an impression of the true power of Blake's artistry.  However, a good teacher will point the student to the Blake Archive at:... so the students can see the works more completely with variants and in better color (if you have good video cards and monitors).<br />One of the best parts of this book begins on page 176 where working drafts are shown and compared to the final versions.  There is also a nice selection of critical writing on Blake - criticism from Blake's time through the present.  There is also a useful bibliography.<br />In some ways this is \\"Erdman Lite\\", but it is much more portable than Erdman and for an introductory course on Blake it is probably sufficient.  I am glad that I have it in my library.<br />But please don't stop here!	2002-09-11

We also feel disloyal to our employer if we prepare for the time of separation.<br />The funny thing is that when the whack comes (and to often it is as unforseen as club to the back of the head) you can bet that the company has prepared very carefully every aspect of our severance package before they apply that hit to the sweet spot on your noggin.<br />Very few people have the clout to get an employment contract let alone negotiate up front for a separation arrangement. For most of us we live in an \\"at will\\" world. The author points out that this \\"at will\\" isn't necessarily as once sided as our employers would have us believe.<br />They rely on the shock of the moment, our lack of preparation, and our shame for losing our job to streamline us into signing away rights and getting the heck out of dodge.  It isn't in their interests to give you time to think and prepare, and, frankly, when you are laying off 1,000 or 10,000 people you simply can't enter into separate negotiations with every one of them.  However, I can tell you that in the UK employees are routinely given employment contracts as they are hired.<br />This is why every employee should read this book today. Prepare and think about the ever more inevitable separation. Empoyees need to be on as equal a footing with their employer as they can; given current laws and the limitations of economics. We need to have more open eyes and be less sentimental about our jobs.<br />This book is a great first step or two on that path. Just as profits are made when you purchase an asset (buying at the right price) - not when you sell them, the basis for your separation (which you should accept as inevitable in some non-specified future) is laid when you are hired. We need to be smarter when we go into these situations and realize the planning and, well, practiced sincerity (masked insincerity) that employers now use during hiring, throughout the term of employment and during termination.<br />They aren't bad people, necessarily, it is just that they are prepared for what is happeneing and most employees are not.  The message of this very helpful book is \\"Get Prepared!\\".<br />It isn't that they are all bad people; it is the nature of the current business and legal climate that leads to much of this nonsense.<br />This book will provide a great morale booster and provide some thoughts that can help even a newly terminated employee create a decent plan of counter-attack. Better to use this information and take positive action than be pushed downstream like so many cut trees.ughout the term of employment and during termination.  <br />They aren't bad people, necessarily, it is just that they are prepared for what is happeneing and most employees are not.

LIke most child I believed what I was taught.  In fact, a great deal of the socialist agenda has come about. However, the results and effects of central planning in private and public affairs came to bother me a great deal.<br />I began to find that there were voices raised opposing this \\"progress\\".  It was not easy to find them at first, but there was an icreasing number of voices pointing out the problems and flaws in central planning.<br />Finally, the tide began to turn in the mid-seventies and as central planning ebbed and private enterprise flooded in with the prosperity of the eighties and nineties it appeared that capitalism was finally triumphant.  Millions of us were happy at what we viewed as true progress.  However, I recognize that millions more were true believers in the other doctrine and viewed this as a dark time.<br />But I am glad of the progress that was made and continue to work for more. And this wonderful book documents the story of the unfortunate but understandable rise of socialism in post World War II Europe and how it fell out of favor. The story of the rise of individual initiative and privatization is wonderful to me, however, it might cause pain and anxiety to others.<br />The point is that this is a very important story told of our own time (until a few years ago). And for those who think that capitalism is the bane of humanity I would recommend this book even more strongly because it is important to not forget the misery central planning brought the world for decades in the 20th century.<br />There is a recent video presentation of much of this book and it is quite good, but the book has more information and I think it is even more compelling. So, I recommend both, but the book even more strongly.<br />The story contained in this book is still open to multiple interpretations. I have mine and you may well disagree with me. What is key, I believe, is that this story be understood and remembered. Otherwise we doom ourselves to repeat the pain of these lessons yet again to the pain and suffering of millions.isagree with me.

It provides the general reader with much needed context and background in order to read Machiavelli's works with any kind of understanding.  While there are good scholarly works that can provide the feeling of more intellectual heft, this book should not be underestimated simply because it is easy to read and doesn't require weeks to read.<br />Machiavelli is one of those brand-name characters that evoke certain reactions in people in such a generalized way that people mistakenly believe they know something about the man and his work.  This book can help debunk much of that received nonsense.  It is surprising how &quot;modern&quot; a man he was considering he lived nearly 500 years ago.<br />The author has admiration for Machiavelli's skills as an analyst and as a diplomat, has sympathy for his personal suffering and disappointments, and forgiving in his attitude towards Machiavelli's human failings (the author might not even agree they were failings - they were just human).  And that is the book's greatest contribution; it shows its subject as a human being rather than a caricature or a statue.<br />In any case, I found this to be a very valuable and entertaining book.  I recommend it highly.  You can draw your own conclusions about the subject and they author's conclusions.  But you will have gained a lot in the process of coming to those (now better informed) conclusions.<br />There are a few helpful maps throughout the book and a suggested reading list at the end.  The translation is terrific.	2002-08-26

Like most people, I had no idea what a brain tumor really is and especially what a GBM IV is. To this day I wish I had never learned that term.<br />But this book was a great help to me as I tried to learn more about the brain's structure and how it works. This is an easy to read book with some very helpful illustrations. It demonstrates the brain's functions by showing its quirks. It is well written and easy (and surprisingly FUN) to read.<br />There is also a helpful bibliography and suggested reading list at the end of the book for those who wish to delve more deeply into the subject. But it is important to know that you don't need any background at all in the brain to enjoy this book.<br />I had no understanding of brain structure beyond what the doctors told me in describing the locations of my father's tumor. This book helped me understand the changes in my fathers abilities and behavior as the tumor destroyed different portions of his brain until it finally ended his life.<br />Honestly, this is a very good book and I think you will get a great deal from it.	2002-08-15

It isn't the normal left-to-right chronological history.  It is a series of chapters that each examine a different aspect of London's character.  That is why it is aptly called a biography.  Rather than a sequential history we get a study of the character of this magnificent city.  I have grown to love London through a series of business trips that led to a few personal trips.  It would be very satisfying to be able to live in London for some period of time, I think.  But...<br />You don't need to have been to London or know much about it to get a great deal from this book.  But if you can bring some experience and background to reading it you will find the rewards for reading so much greater.<br />As background material Stephen Inwood's wonderful \\"A History of London\\", now in paperback, provides a splendid chronology of London's history.  I recommend it highly and you can read my comments on it on Amazon.com.  My personal taste is to read the Inwood and then read the Ackroyd.  But the point is to have both.  Together they tell more about London than either does separately.  They are complementary rather than competitive.  Simplistically, you can say the Inwood book gives you the breadth and the Ackroyd book provides the depth.<br />Also, you will get more out of this book if you have a good map of London at your side.  The book does have some maps, but if you want a good feel for how all of this fits into the London of today you might want to have a London A-Z with you as a reference.  A standard one has the ISBN: 0850397529.<br />Also, another magnificent companion to this book is \\"The History of London in Maps\\" its ISBN# is:1558594957 although it has limited availability.<br />London is an easy city to love and I think Ackroyd says it so well on page 93: \\"The History of London is a palimpsest of different realities and lingering truths.\\"  And in the books last two sentences: \\"It is illimitable.  It is infinite London.\\"  Glorious!ous!	2002-08-10

I think the ideal reader is someone who is interested in numbers and likes to think about things in logical and interesting ways.<br />While I found this book a lot of fun (even at my age), I think it would be ideal for a high-school student who had developed some facility with numbers and was busy developing their thinking patterns.  This book would help them learn to think in new ways and probably give them some new paths to explore.<br />It isn't just interesting problems, although there are many very interesting things to solve.  There are fascinating lists and explanations that can spur continued investigation and even provoke development through disagreement!<br />The &quot;answers&quot; in the back provide explanations that are also written as a springboard for further investigation.<br />Good stuff!  Four stars only because it is so specialized.  But if you like this topic it is a five star book.	2002-07-27

No, I am not a junkie and haven't read every book written on the subject.  I was just short of 15 years old when Armstrong and Aldrin landed on the moon.  Since I read all the news stories and followed things closely in Life, Look, and National Geographic, I thought I new the story.<br />Well, there is a lot behind the scenes that, of course, I did not know.  Especially on the Soviet (Russian) side!  I don't want to spoil the story because this is such a fun and fast read that I want to encourage you to read it.  I think you will be shocked at the smoke and mirrors the Soviets used to &quot;compete&quot;.  But, I don't want to appear jingoistic here (even though I almost certainly am over proud and over confident in US technical prowess).  You really need to read this and judge for yourself.<br />I gave it four instead of five stars because I think it is a specialized topic.  But if you like the topic it is a terrific book.  You won't want to put this down and can get through it in a day or two - three at a leisurely pace.	2002-07-27

When I actaully READ the book it turned out to be something quite different.<br />What you get is a look at media claims about the objectivity and centrism compared with what they actually say and do.  There are 35 (thirty-five) pages of small-type footnotes documenting these stories so you can check for yourself if the author has presented the story or comment accurately.  While I can't claim to have made a comprehensive check, what I have looked at has either been dead on or - at worst - maybe a bit ambiguous (and not many of those, however).  This is a better track-record than I have seen from FAIR's attacks on the conservatives.<br />Ann Coulter is not objective, and does not claim to be.  She is a conservative partisan and given to hyperbole.  This is hurt her a couple of times, but it certainly makes her prose vivid.  She is also very tough and not willing to make nice-nice with those who want to undermine her credibility via ad-hominem venom masquerading as analysis.  And since she is a woman, being that tought is hard for some to accept.<br />At our house, however, she is accepted.  We understand her frustration in not seeing her viewpoint given a serious presentation in the mainstream discussion of issues (except on the periphery and always with \\"distancing quotes\\" and verbal cues to alert the viewer to be on guard for what is to follow.  I live in Ann Arbor and grew up in Wayne County.  Being a conservative has not been easy around here.  Don't get me wrong, I haven't been trashed or threatened, but there have been many times when I have taken a lonely stance and have had to resist great social pressure to conform.<br />This media bias (witting or unwitting) is also discussed in Bernard Goldberg's wonderful \\"Bias\\", but this book is less restrained in its tone and, yes, \\"Slander\\" does have an acerbic edge.  But being acerbic or sardonic is NOT the same as ad hominm or mean or false.<br />Another wonderful book to read if you are interested in understanding the problem of liberal bias is Thomas Sowell's \\"The Vision of the Anointed\\".  But that book was also reviewed through ad hominem rather than debated.<br />That this book has zoomed to the top of the best seller list speaks to the vast unreported frustration of citizens with the media.  Well, maybe unreported is a bit strong.  It is reported, but usually as the frustration of the ignorant, unsophisticated, and uninformed.  That kind of reporting only adds to the frustration because we aren't any more ignorant, unsophisticaed, or uninformed than those espousing the liberal viewpoint.<br />This book should be read if for nothing else than its footnotes.  If you hate Coulter, fine.  Don't read the book itself. Just read the footnotes, and go look up the sources, and then spend some time reflecting on what those articles and statements really mean. Is it really possible that there is NO point here?  That is for each reader to decide.  But I bet that the great majority of the readers of this book will decide that this book makes a big point that is important for our current media discourse.c edge.

While taking the core finance course in the MBA program at the University of Michigan b-school I realized that I should have taken the core statistics course FIRST.  But I hadn't and as certain concepts were introduced I realized that I had no background that would help me understand the topic.<br />So, I found this book and spent two weeks studying it so I could understand what was going on and then spent the rest of the term trying to catch up.<br />This is a very good introduction to the most basic ideas.  I think it would be a great book for a junior or senior in high school who had a good math background and wanted to get a grounding in statistics.  Or a college level person like me without a background and needing to get up to speed in a hurry.<br />My thanks to Patricia Elmore and Paula Woehlk for the help!	2002-07-13

If you are a believer, ... it helps to make things more specific and yet less cut and dried. Just like real life.<br />If you aren't a believer, and in fact if you actively disbelieve the Book of Mormon, that is OK too. You will get a more specific look at the vision of things you actively disbelieve.<br />In either case it is a helpful and valuable book, as are all of Sorenson's works.	2002-07-13

There are no conclusions drawn or analysis of the case or even questions to think about. There is also no follow up on the corporations included and how their plans were actually implemented or if they survived.<br />However, the cases are divided up into three parts and each part has a short essay that introductes the general theme for the cases and offers a paragraph summary of each case.  There is also a reding list of academic papers and books that can be used to delve deeper on that parts topic.  This does add real value to this book.<br />Just like in b-school, you are expected to dig, dig, dig. And this is a good thing. Don't get me wrong. You will learn more by asking yourself questions about what all the information means. And if you are an experienced case reader you will pretty much know what you should go after. And these cases have a extremely useful financials associated with them (analyzing these is where the real payoff is). You can do a lot of the follow up on your own by digging through Internet resources such as WSJ, Yahoo, and Hoovers, etc.<br />Just don't expect any easy conclusions in the book because it is designed for use in class so all of the conclusions have to be held back or the cases become useless for teaching. However, since discussion of cases is the best place to get new insights above your own analysis, it would be GREAT if the publisher or the author put up a website where purchasers of this book could discuss the cases with each other.<br />Maybe this would be the same problem as publishing analysis. However, my only frustration with this wonderful book is that even though I have gotten a great deal from it and will continue to benefit from it as a resource text for years to come, I KNOW I could get more out of it by discussing it with others. Each of these cases would be terrific for class use.<br />The cases are all five star. I gave the book four stars only because of my personal frustrations in not being able to get other discussion about the cases and because of its very specialized topic.

The very size of this book on such a specialized topic may seem daunting. However, the writing is so lively and the organization by question and answer is so easy to use that you will find this a very useful and comprehensive handbook.<br />It is NOT a theory laden textbook. Rather, it is a very useful and practical guide to the field and will help the careful reader avoid many pitfalls. There are many ways to make mistakes in buying companies and this book can open your eyes to quite of few of them.  In fact, if you are the target of a buyout, this book can be of special importance and interest.<br />I admit to being fascinated by this topic so take that into consideration when evaluating what I say about this book. But even so, mergers and acquistions are so much in the news (for good and ill) that it can only help to get more background on what is really going on and how these deals are (or at least should be) put together.<br />The book reads MUCH shorter than its size and is fairly comprehensive on the subject - from the methods in selecting candidates for acquisition to what to do when you are a target of an acquisition to some very specialized topics. It also deals with M&A issues with both public, private, and even family firms.<br />Honestly, I am surprised at how glad I am that I bought this book. It is terrific.	2002-07-03

When purchasing a company you need to know what to look for and where to look for it and what it is you are looking at when you get the information you asked for.<br />If you are selling your company you need to know what someone SHOULD be looking for, where they will look for it, and the kinds of conclusions they should be drawing from what they are seeing.<br />This book is an incredibly valuable resource in this process.  It is organized very logically and is a series of questions and answers so you can hop around to the information you need for the moment.  However, it is also written in such a lively manner that it is easy to read from beginning to end.  I happen to be fascinated by this topic and think this is an incredibly helpful handbook.<br />I think that the way you conduct due dilligence says a lot about your chances of success with an acquisition.  And I also think that if someone is trying to buy you, you can tell a lot about them by what they want to know and the conclusions they draw from what they see.  In either case it behooves you to invest time and a couple of books in a book like this.  Well, in this book.	2002-07-03

The essays it contains are extremely valuable and packed tight with information, insight, and great thinking.<br />There are also many very valuable footnotes that can lead you to deeper reading on the subject of the current state of thinking on the very important topic of Free Trade.<br />Dr. Bhagwati is a stalwart of Free Trade and has the intellectual and verbal firepower to stand up for this very important concept and its role in relieving poverty around the world.  He isn't a beautiful writer, but he certainly is effective and I am so glad to be able to have his writing and thinking available to me.<br />This book is a fine addition and should be read by those on both sides of this issue with an open mind.  Dr. Bhagwati is one of those important thinkers that will benefit your own thinking even when you disagree with them because it will force you to sharpen your own thinking and force you to build better arguments.<br />One of the great parts of the first essay is when he takes us through the sequence of thought as arguments were put forward, successfully attacked and new models were built, attacked, and re-built until the present day.  He is also very honest about the current weaknesses in present models and possible paths to pursue as a way to solve them.  Just very valuable stuff.	2002-07-03

It seemed to me that I could benefit from knowing more about the China of today rather than the Red China I grew up with.<br />The value of this book can best be described by the reaction of the Chinese students to it.  They couldn't put it down.  They flipped from topic to topic and talked about it with each other and with me.  They praised the articles the book contains.<br />It isn't a narrative.  It is a series of articles on important topics and arranged alphabetically.  It contains many valuable maps, photos, and diagrams.

It IS a book to TEACH you about building spreadsheets for use in finance.  The author has built dozens of very useful spreadsheets that he gives you step-by-step instructions on building and WHAT the step is about.<br />If you build all of the spreadsheets in the book you will gain a great deal of understanding about the subjects covered in the book and will be miles ahead of the calculator-based approach typical in today's classrooms.  No professionals use calculators to figure duration or convexity or optimal portfolios, why should you?  This is a very needed book and a nice approach to the subject.<br />I like this version of the book MUCH better than the Fundamentals version.  But that is my preference; pick the book that is right for you.  They are both very good.  I intend to get more in the series.	2002-06-15

I find it to be engagingly written (yes, engaging!) with well-chosen examples.  It is very nice to be able to read a book about Bonds and find it stimulating. It would have been easy to write a book that could act as a sleep-aid.  Instead, this book provides learning objectives for each chapter and the prose is so inviting that I felt the book to be a page-turner.<br />The math used is not complicated and is chosen to help understanding rather than demonstrate the sophisticated math used in the actual world of bond trading.  If you want that kind of material this isn't the book for you.<br />I don't know if there is a solutions manual available, but I couldn't find it.  If there isn't, there should be.  I have never had a college course that used the problems in the book for actual coursework and yet, no matter how simple the problems seem, it is nice for the student to be able to confirm that he or she has indeed found the right answer.<br />There are also many helpful footnotes that point to materials for further and deeper reading on the subjects introduced in this fine book.	2002-06-14

There is a lot more to it than the simple bromides peddled in the popular press and media. Yet, when you get some basic concepts down, they become easier to understand and evaluate. The popular press is misleading in its oversimplification and silly statements (like \\"no one is buying today\\").<br />I want to praise this edition's organization. Since it is a text designed for use by students, the fifth edition I used is organized most helpfully. Each chapter has an overview and there are concept check questions at key points of the text that help you assess if you really understood the information you just read. The main points are restated in a concise summary at the end of each chapter and you can review the key terms to make sure you are absorbing the vocabulary.<br />There are valuable websites listed along the way for additional and related information. The authors and publisher also provide a website with materials including spreadsheets directly related to this book. The part of the site with online quizzes has a few typos and scoring errors, and that should be fixed, but the online materials are generally ok.<br />The chapter problems are another matter. Some are really projects and should be separated, I feel, from the study questions. They are good to do if you have the time and will certainly help your learning, but they can take some time to work through.<br />Some of the questions are very simple and are really a quick concept check and they seem out of place when placed along side the \\"projects\\". One VERY NICE feature of the questions is the inclusion of sample CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) exam questions. This is very useful for those of us thinking about preparing for that process.<br />It is also worth getting the Solutions Manual. ISBN 0-07-233921-7. Don't by a mismatched solutions manual! As you work through the problems, especially the \\"projects\\" it is nice to see how these problems are handled by the authors.problems, especially the \\"projects\\" it is nice to see how these problems are handled by the authors.	2002-06-14

In 1995 & '96 I was traveling to London regularly on business trips.  During one of my site seeing ventures the name of William Blake finally penetrated my consciousness.  I became fascinated with the gallery the Tate museum (now Tate Britain) had of his work.  I saw this book at the airport and picked it up and it became a London obsession for me.  When I would get back to London I would look up streets and sites that I had read about in this WONDERFUL book.<br />This was the first book of Ackroyd's I read and became a fan immediately.  Since he is also a writer of fiction and is a profound scholar of London he offers great insight into Blake and his art.  I have since added many other volumes of Blake's works and other books on Blake to my library but I still have deep affection for this book.  When someone asks me what book they should read about Blake I always point them to this great book.<br />You will get to know Blake's life and work, but you will also get to know Blake's relationship to London (where he spent almost all of his life) and to the other artists of his time such as Flaxman, Reynolds, and others. It is even worth re-reading.  That is high praise!	2002-05-30

I would give this book six stars if I could.  It is one of my favorite books of all time.  More than any other book I have ever read I learned about the subject of the biography (Hogarth in this case) because of the beautiful way the author placed him in his time.  By learning about Hogarth's world we can learn so much about the artistic fashions of his time and how that influenced the way he made his art.  We also learn about the influence Hogarth's artistic genius had in re-shaping that world and the artists who followed him.<br /><br />We learn about his family ties to the court and his failed ambitions there.  But his ambitions for his art were even higher and there he succeeded to our great benefit.  We also learn about his quirky personality, how his friends described him, and their wonderful stories of their life with him.  Hogarth was as amazing a character as any he drew.<br /><br />The book is also full of wonderfully reproduced art in black and white and a generous number of works are reproduced in color.  Ms Uglow gives us in depth and wonderfully insightful instruction about all these works.  It is a big book, but one I believe you will always treasure having read.  It is brilliantly written.  This book has a prominent place in my library and one I urge everyone to read.  It is a treasure.<br /><br />Here is Uglow's recent and wonderful biography of Thomas Bewick:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0374112363 Nature's Engraver: A Life of Thomas Bewick]]	2002-05-30

You shouldn't reject this book based upon your opinion of its subject.  The books is written very well and evokes enough of the times in which Taylor lived to give us a more nuanced portrait of the man within the context of his world.<br />Nowadays, F.W. Taylor is often portrayed as either a villain who has all but enslaved us or he is defended as not really meaning what he said. Instead, this book shows us Taylor's nineteenth century upper middle-class background and spends a good amount of time on character development and work habits.<br />Once all this is understood, Taylor's seemingly obsessive goals become more understandable. He did have many important insights in making work efficient. When he began manufacturing was done in thousands of very small shops. It was horribly inefficient. His work did help our economy and helped the average worker become more productive. However, I still can't understand how someone could think having a human body physically haul 47 tons of pig iron per day is a good thing. There is a definite quality of life aspect that still wasn't grasped by these early efficiency experts.<br />Another extremely valuable topic the author clarifies is that Henry Ford's assembly line had more to do with meatpacking than Taylor's Scientific Management. Taylor's critics have unjustly used Henry Ford's manufacturing techniques as evidence against Taylor's methods when Ford himself made statements denying Taylor's influence. Also, like many original thinkers, Taylor was ill served by many who came after him and used his name but not his methods. This is all clearly laid out in this valuable book.<br />This isn't a whitewash or a book of simple praise. It paints a complex portrait of Taylor, but gives us enough context to understand him within his time. We get to know something of his character and that helps a great deal. It is a big book but reads short and is surprisingly engaging for a book on manufacturing. This book gave me insights into the early twentieth century that I needed to make certain pieces fall into place. It has a prominent place in my library and I hope a lot of people read it.ave me insights into the early twentieth century that I needed to make certain pieces fall into place.

The life of Thomas More is one of the great stories of London.  Ackroyd is unmatched in his ability to give just the right historical context to make his telling of his subject's story vivid and alive. The author loves his subject enough to give More an honest and complex portrait. The writing is wonderful, but there is also no white washing or simplifying for the kiddies.<br />Yet More's greatness and honesty are clear and impressive. His humanity and what we would judge as failings (often mistakenly, I believe) serve, in my mind, to accentuate what he was able to become out of the lump of imperfect clay we all are. His work and faith and integrity stand as a monument to his name for all time.<br />There are some wonderful pictures and discussions of the portraits in the context of More's life. This is very good stuff and I am grateful to the author for this brilliant book.	2002-05-25

This book is a GREAT place to start.<br />The book provides a good overview of what diabetes really is and why it is so destructive.  But MUCH MORE important is the help it gives us in understanding how the disease impacts the way one lives.  If the diabetes is responded to constructively the situation can be improved.  Depending on the severity of the condition it can be improved a little bit to, in a mild case, something like normality.  Most are somewhere in the middle.<br />The danger is to ignore the condition.  This book can help make clear all the good things that can come from responding positively to the condition and gives helpful information on how to do that.  And you can find specific information very quickly because the book is so thoughtfully organized.	2002-05-21

For us, this book by Prof. Neftci is a gift!<br />Now, I am NOT bashing marketing and organizational behavior.  In fact, math can be used to great advantage in those fields, but you do find many who feel very uncomfortable with much beyond algebra and that is ok, too.  And it is very possible to work in finance without understanding the math behind the tools and principles taught in the basic courses.  However, if you want to go deeper than the basic courses this book can be a great next step.<br />The truly mathematical seem to feel that this book doesn't go far enough and that may be true if you want to get to the very bottom of the subjects reviewed here.  If you think of this book as an intermediate step that gives you more than the simple treatment you get in most MBA courses and not as intense as you would get in &quot;Continuous Stochastic Calculus with Applications to Finance&quot; and that is what you want then this book is for you (and for me).<br />Plus there is a nice bibliography that can help you dive even deeper.	2002-05-21

I urge you to read it.  Especially now when there are many forces rising who dream that if only the good hearted could let government fix things for us all the evils in the world would be done away.  This is an ignorance that failed during the last century and has simply bought a new suit and is trying to take the stage again.<br />If you want to see more clearly the kinds of things we will be facing if we go that route again this book is an excellent primer.  The authors show us the unintended consequences of government action.  Most helpfully, they help expose the mischaracterizations of the arguments for market economies and free trade.<br />The sad thing is that the present generation has not lived under the government foolishness of the New Deal through the seventies and so the siren song of the socialists (now once again hiding behind the noun Progressive) is appealing.  It would be so simple if there were just one bad guy (and given today's politics it is always a guy or Margaret Thatcher) whom we could denounce and ring in Paradise.<br />It isn't that simple.<br />But it helps to have a foundation on which to build a good intellectual framework.  The work of Milton Friedman is a great place to start.  This book is a nice introduction to his work.  His wife Rose is such a nice writer and herself a good thinker and explainer that this book is a delight to read.  Really, this is fun stuff.  Really...	2002-04-26

It is unnecessary to agree with much in the book to get immense value from it.  Dr. Wilson has great understanding of his field, good insight into many others, and a good heart and enthusiasm for most everything else; even for ideas and beliefs with which he disagrees.<br />And that is the same generosity of spirit we should bring to a reading of this book.  It provides us with so much to think about that even though it is not a thick book and though it is written very well, it is something we should not read too quickly.  We can get much more from it by reading and contemplating his points and arguments.  Doing so can help us strengthen our own beliefs even in disagreement with the author.<br />Consilience is the property of unity or agreement or concurrence across disciplines Wilson sees in knowledge that does not occur in false ideas.  It is a property that tends to confirm something we think we know as something we can trust as probably true.  True things resonate while error tends to exist in its own unsightly and disconnected way.  The author demonstrates this for us many times in the brilliant exposition of the natural sciences.  He then migrates into other areas we humans value such as the social sciences, art, and ethics (and religion).<br />I personally believe as he does that in the end that truth will be consilient.  However, I have several questions I would love to ask him about the edifice he constructs in the second half of the book.  His ambitious and speculative vision of where we will end up and the path we will take in getting there is one that I have some problems with.<br />However, I cannot claim he is wrong and I am correct.  First, because I cannot claim that I actually understand his points well enough to falsify them (even though I think I can push a couple of his minor points over) and second because I cannot claim to know the future any better than he does.  But I can say that this book is something anyone who wants to gain a better understanding of the state of current human understanding should read.  It has great value and that is high praise for any book.to know the future any better than he does.

You will become a better watcher of news programs and a more careful reader of newspapers and magazines of opinion.  Mr. Goldberg does us a real service by taking us into the information industry with an insiders eyes and understanding.  He writing style is simple and effective so the book is quite an easy and VERY interesting read.<br />However, if you are a Republican looking for confirmation of a left-wing conspiracy this isn't the book for you.  Mr. Goldberg's point is much more subtle than that.  He repeats several times in different ways that the news professionals do NOT purposefully go hard on the GOP and soft on the Democrats.  What they do they do because they are blind to how far off the center they are.<br />In fairness, this is part of the human condition.  Most of us have friends to the left of us and friends to the right of us so we can easily fall in the trap of thinking we are in the middle, that we are moderate, that we are mainstream.  Almost none of us really are.  One of the limitations of the human condition is our truncated experience and understanding of reality.  We have to work very hard to extend our reference points beyond the range of our life's experiences and most people simply don't spend that much energy on that project.<br />This is the source of the liberal bias in the media, according to Mr. Goldberg (if I am reading him correctly).  Rather, Brokaw, Jennings, the NY Times, and Washington Post (and others) BELIEVE they are mainstream and do not seek any evidence to the contrary.  They simply believe all those Red States are way to the right and never stop to think that being in the middle means being in the middle of the WHOLE range of views and opinions and not just your own life's experiences or those of your associates.<br />Anyway, I think you will gain a lot from the book.  The time investment won't be large and it will give you some good thinking material, if you care to use it that way, no matter if you are on the left or the right.  You might really be in the middle not many people are really there.  The math says so.  Most of us are somewhere on a continuum to one side or the other, and we might be on different sides on different issues.  It always helps to challenge yourself by seeking out serious views different than your own and wrestle with them.  This book provides a healthy dose of that for both sides if they will read it thoughtfully rather than bringing their preconceptions to it and simply look for confirmation.if you care to use it that way, no matter if you are on the left or the right.

Well, it IS NOT a book about 9/11 or Islamic Radicalism directly.  Instead, it is a book that delivers background on Islamic culture and how the power or resentment became a dominant force that has lead time and time again to extreme expression against the West in various forms.<br />Bernard Lewis has a depth of understanding of the history of this region that few others can equal.  Add his wonderful way with words and his manner of expression and you have an unequaled treasure.<br />Some have complained that the book centers on Turkey rather than Iraq, Iran, Israel, Palestine, or Saudi Arabia.  The reason is the Ottoman Empire ruled the region from Turkey for hundreds of years until it broke apart in the twentieth century.<br />Others have complained that they felt it boring because it doesn't deal with the latest events. It went to press BEFORE 9/11.  More than that, however, is the truth that the background provided here is essential to have more than a surface understanding of how these contemporary events came to be.<br />It is a slim volume but it is packed with wisdom, insight, and just plain wonderful writing.  Treat yourself to this pearl.	2002-04-20

Look, you know you have wanted to read this epic poem since it was first assigned to you in high school. I for one never quite got around to reading it until this translation came out. It has the reputation of being opaque and the narrative thread can seem hopelessly confusing.<br />With this wonderful translation Seamus Heany makes it such a wonderful read and the story's simplicity is so clear that you will wonder what all the fuss and difficulty was about. Yet this translation tells the tale with great power and beauty.<br />Mr. Heany also provides us with a nice introduction and an essential set of family trees in the back.<br />I know this is one of those things we are supposed to read and for that reason many avoid it. However, this IS a great read with wonderful images and great monsters and heros that are somehow monumental and ancient but still not hopelessly removed from our time.<br />The original Anglo-Saxon is given on the left hand pages and is wonderful to try and puzzle out. I wish that I had time to learn to read it. What I would REALLY like is a recording of the sound of this being read in the original tongue.<br />More than cool!<br />Mr. Heany also has a disk and tape out where he reads this poem. Very worthwhile.	2002-04-18

As I read it I do not feel that Mr. Hitchens is calling for a turning back of the clock or to bring back any \\"bad old days\\" for anyone.  What he is arguing for, I believe, is for us to think about and to fully realize that change comes at a cost.  Sometimes the change is good, but sometimes it comes at the cost of losing something else that was good.<br />Our progressive age (the past century and a half) has certainly accomplished some things that were worthwhile.  But at times the progressive urge has overtaken any sense of reason or restraint and there was change for the sake of change.  Worse, change for the sake of fantasy.  Hitchens, in this wonderful book, presents us with some views of what he thinks we have lost.  I say we, even though he is speaking of Britain, much of what he talks about has at least an oblique corollary in the US.<br />We have to get over this notion that all change equals progress and that progress is universally salutary in consequence or that our age is the most enlightened and humane that has emerged from a recently benighted past.  If the Whig interpretation of history is the view that all of the past was building up to the realization of the glorious present there is also a Progressive interpretation of history.  It is that the present could be a golden age of happiness for all humanity if only they would realize how awful the past really was and how miserable their lives truly are and awaken from this false consciousness to the Progressive view of things.<br />As Hitchens points out so masterfully over and over again, no amount of evidence can overcome invincible ignorance.  However, I think by reading this book and at least thinking about what he has to say rather than simply rejecting it as reactionary blathering there is a lot to be gained.  It certainly can help us understand more about how the present go this way and why some traditional things still linger on when the Progressive view says that such things should simply evaporate in the mists like a bad dream.  Well, my friends, there is much more to history than any one view of things can account for.  And Hitchens has done us a service by helping us see clearly what we have too easily consigned to the dustbin of history and what it has cost us.view says that such things should simply evaporate in the mists like a bad dream.

If you are interested in thinking about what can be done in poor nations to allow the poverty stricken to find their way out of their misery, this book will offer a great deal to think about.  It is easy to over simplify the author's argument to saying that it is about property rights.  That really isn't it.  What he is talking about is the system the wealthy nations have developed that not only protects property with laws, but the confidence that comes with a society of laws.<br />Additionally, property has to be able to be abstracted and capitalized and then bought and sold.  Making many able to own a factory via shares and to be able to trade ownership in one thing into cash and then the cash into ownership into something preferable is the real underlying mechanism that allows for simultaneous benefits from trading. It stops being a zero sum game.  Both parties are improved.<br />De Soto's thought and argument is more nuanced than his critics allow and his serious concern and energy on behalf of the poor of our world is palpable.  Whether you agree with him completely is not as important as your reading and thinking about what he asks you to consider.  No matter your political persuasion (unless you are so decided you need no other information), you will be rewarded by reading this book and considering seriously the propositions offered here.	2002-03-28

I must admit to being awed reading through the history of the development of our special forces teams and what these individuals have to go through to become part of these units.  As an outsider I had no idea what these men had to accomplish just to qualify!<br />Then to read about the kinds of things they have done in service to our country is exhilarating as adventure, but as I contemplate the very real sacrifices that are made by these professional heroes I am deeply grateful to them.<br />Far from being held up high by the Armed Forces of our country, these teams were developed against the wishes of the top brass and worked with only minimal support.  But they were devoted to their mission and we should keep in our memories all that has been sacrificed by them for us and for our way of life.  It is true in the time of battle they fight for each other, but they join and serve because of their love of country.<br />Most of their service is done in secret and is still not known. They are not glory hounds nor are they bloody Rambo types.  In reading this book you will get to know some really amazing people.  Their real life is more amazing than a lot of the stuff writers make up.  Tom Clancy made a great move in writing with these heroes.  His fictional stories should be so good!<br />We need to be more aware of the role the Special Forces teams play in our present War On Terror and support them in their efforts to protect and defend us.  Some will denigrate and disparage those who serve, we need to raise our voices in support and praise.	2002-03-28

This is one of the very best books I have used while working on an MBA.  It will occupy a prominent place on my business resources bookshelf.  What makes it so special is that it covers the field of investment valuation very broadly, but each topic is handled concisely and with clarity.  The author also supplies a healthy amount of context and supporting information as well as the technical matters around valuation.<br />Another virtue is that it is laid out very well.  If you are interested in a specific topic, for example valuing a company with negative earnings or a private company or even contracts for natural resources, it is easy to look up the specific information and study what is relevant to the task at hand.<br />Plus the author has a wonderful website with supporting spreadsheets and valuable information on companies that can help a great deal in thinking through the topics raised in the book.<br />If I could only have two or three books of all those I have used during my work at the University of Michigan Business School, this would be one of the keepers.	2002-03-28

Inside the Secret World of Osama Bin Laden	Books	4	9	13	N	N	Solid reporting - we face a very deep and broad threat	This book should be widely read. It should be read by anyone who wants to read solid reporting and the facts about the current conflict. Bergen provides us with compelling evidence that the current situation is deeper, broader, and even more serious than the popular media has led us to believe. It isn't that the media isn't spending enough minutes hyping everything about bin Laden. It's that the reporting on TV spends too much time on the easy and big images.<br />In this book we are taken into how al Qaeda and Islamist movements have had agents trained not only to fly airplanes, but placed their people in our military - in the US ARMY!<br />Bergen takes us to London and introduces us to key Islamist contacts and explains why that city is a base of operations for those who support the terrorists we are now fighting. We are also shown how other conflicts in the Middle East and around the world (including Kashmir, Chechnya, and the Philippines) are tied into this misery.<br />These people are true believers who cannot be dissuaded from their long-term vision of a world power dominated by their extreme version of Islam. Daniel Pipes and Bernard Lewis have also written importantly on this last theme.<br />This is a jam-packed book that helps us non-specialists get up to speed on a serious situation in a hurry. I not only recommend it, I urge you to read it. It isn't sensationalist in any way. It is a serious piece that is well written and ably presented. The only thing it doesn't provide that I wish it had is some pictures of the main protagonists. Maybe there aren't any. It would have been nice to see who the players are in supporting bin Laden's vision around the world and who are standing against him. But this is a small point and a quibble.<br />These extremists are not after freedom, democracy, or human well-being as we understand that in the West. They are pursuing a vision that makes little sense to the western mind, but makes perfect sense to them. The question isn't about debating them. It is how do we render them incapable of inflicting that vision on others and prevent the destruction they so freely meet out in pursuit of their vision of the world.<br />Each of us will have to come to our own conclusions about that, but being armed with the information provided in this book will help in coming to a better-informed opinion.n isn't about debating them.

It is far richer in detail, context, and let's us a bit deeper into why what Nash accomplished was so beautiful.  If you find the movie a bit of a problem because it seems a bit too glossy for the facts, again, you will love this book.<br />For me, the movie did a marvelous job of embodying the spirit of the book.  To delve more deeply into the facts of Nash's life and accomplishments and his illness would require a documentary or a mini-series. The movie is really a narrative poem about Nash.  This book is about the people and their experiences.  It is NOT a direct exposition of Nash's technical achievements.  There are other books such as &quot;The Essential John Nash&quot; that provide that information.<br />In this masterful book we find out more about his youth, his life at college, his work after he received his doctorate and his breakdown and illness as well as the nature and scope of his recovery.  There is real sorrow and loss in the book, but there is also strength and tenacity that refuses to yield to hopelessness and despair.  This is a book about the people and how they lived during the storms of his achievements and his illness.<br />I am not qualified to discuss the quality of Nash's achievements, but from the admiration lavished on him by his peers and how they rallied round him it is clear that Nash was given immense gifts that he developed and used in ways that have benefited all of us even if we are unaware it.<br />It seems that this is the nature of the gifts scientists and mathematicians give us.  We are unaware of them until another person makes them part of other products, services, and policies that directly affect us.  And even then we are unaware of the breakthroughs that made these wonderful additions to our lives possible.<br />We should be grateful to Sylvia Nasar for helping us see the gifts we received from Dr. Nash and the sacrifices his wife and others made to make them possible.made to make them possible.	2002-01-13

This is an excellent book that covers the times in which Ali grew up and effectively uses the differences between Patterson, Liston, and Ali as a way of illustrating the diverse atmosphere of race relations in America in the forties, fifties, and especially the sixties. The author gives us important insight into why Ali is so special as an athlete and as a cultural icon.  He shows us not only his physical powers, but also his inner strength and resolve.  This is all shown without glossing over Ali's weaknesses and failings.<br />However, Ali's weaknesses and failings are simply part of the human condition.  His desire to be a force for good in this world, to help others, and above all, to be free, are inspiring to read about and to contemplate.  That he was able to remain true to himself and his beliefs in the face of incredible pressure from all sides is proof of his historical worth.<br />This is a book worth reading and especially now as background to the movie &quot;Ali&quot;. There are also wonderful pictures that show how remarkable Ali really was in his prime.	2001-12-30

To come as far as he has after such inauspicious beginnings makes his triumph all the greater.  Frankly, if this life were written as fiction I would have criticized the story for putting too many roadblocks, false starts, and squandered opportunities in the protagonist's path to success.  Frankly, I find it hard to believe someone could come so far with what amounts to an amazingly late start down the path to an academic career.  However, reality has a way of confounding our expectations and this is the real life story of a well-known man whom many of us admire greatly<br />It isn't just that he has accomplished a great deal in his life from difficult beginnings.  While such a story is always heartening, there are many examples of overcoming adversity.  This is a story about a life of high academic achievement that almost comes out of nowhere.  Yes, he had some foundation laid when he was a child, but it was more that he had a few accidental years of good primary education.  Everything else about his life was driving him away from building on any education he happened to glean along the way.  He made some efforts to continue his education as an adult, but during his critical years of adolescence he left school without graduating and even his later first attempts at college were not glowing successes.<br />Thankfully, for us (for me), he eventually did find his way to academic success.  The story of his teaching career is another tale of success found in a sequence of unlikely events.<br />Dr. Sowell is a much different personality than I would have predicted, and certainly his absolutely uncompromising positions on certain things are important to his sense of self and integrity.  However, I must admit, that my life has taught me some different lessons about compromise as accommodation versus compromise as abandonment of principal although I admit there comes a fine line that is easy to cross.  But sometimes &quot;personal integrity&quot; is really just a mask for a rigid indifference to others that creates its own problems and injustices.  I am not saying this is the case with Dr. Sowell, but it  is a lesson I have learned in living my own life.  In any case, I found his life and his approach to it very instructive.  His strength and determination are inspiring.  He has given me a great deal to think about as he always does and I thank him for it.<br />Knowing more about his life has made me want to read even more of his work including his earlier works and gives a richer context to what I have already read.  I was a fan and enthusiast of his before I read this book.  Now I have a deeper sense of how much it has cost him to provide me with his wisdom and insight.  Now I feel a quieter gratitude for his work and generosity.<br />This is a book that is not only worth reading, it will enrich you and defy your expectations.

For some he can do no good and for others he can do no wrong.  Of course, he is just human being.  Yes, he has done some extraordinary things and found a perfect environment to exploit his great strengths.  However, the myths that have grown up around him, I believe, have done him more harm than good.<br />Leaders have to embody a vision that others can follow. This requires their strengths to be exaggerated and their weaknesses to be airbrushed out.  Otherwise the simple complexities and contradictions of being a mere mortal would impair the ability to lead.  The very great leaders always include some foibles in their persona in order to appear human without revealing too much of the actual person.<br />This book, I believe, does reveal more of the real Jack Welch than we as the public could really expect to know.  In that way it is very generous.  Of course, this isn't Proust, so the personal analysis only goes so far.  For all I know, Welch may not be capable of deep introspection.  Few people are.<br />What he does give us here is very important if you are interested in business in any way.  Forests have been felled writing about the initiatives undertaken at GE like &quot;Forced Ranking&quot; and &quot;Leadership Training&quot;.  It is wonderful to read about how and WHY those concepts were developed and in what cultural context they are used.  It is easy to use a term like &quot;Forced Ranking&quot;, use it destructively and then blame the concept.<br />Here Mr. Welch tells us how &quot;Forced Ranking&quot; is used in a culture of continuous and bluntly honest appraisals along with opportunities for improvement and growth.  He also explains why he thinks moving people out of an organization sooner rather than later is better for their career.  I happen to agree with him on this, but it is up to the reader to decide.  What is useful is to the context in which the term was developed and used.<br />I also found it very interesting that the company has realized the gaming that can be done with the &quot;#1 or #2 - Fix, Sell, or Close&quot; strategy and found a way to revitalize itself by defining its businesses as only having a 10 to 15 percent market share. This ability to find ways to get the company to see itself anew is one of the great strengths Mr. Welch brought to his job as CEO.  It challenged the company to strive and compete instead of basking in the glow of its long success.  Yes, change can be uncomfortable.  We have all had times where we would rather have continued along the path we were on rather than wrenching ourselves in new directions.  But Mr. Welch is simply telling an important truth about life, not just about GE.<br />The book is an easy and fast read, but offers a lot of food for thought.  There are many humorous and self-deprecating anecdotes.  But Mr. Welch's fierce competitive spirit shines through.

I recommend it highly.also found it very interesting that the company has realized the gaming that can be done with the &quot;#1 or #2 - Fix, Sell, or Close&quot; strategy and found a way to revitalize itself by defining its businesses as only having a 10 to 15 percent market share. This ability to find ways to get the company to see itself anew is one of the great strengths Mr. Welch brought to his job as CEO.  It challenged the company to strive and compete instead of basking in the glow of its long success.  Yes, change can be uncomfortable.  We have all had times where we would rather have continued along the path we were on rather than wrenching ourselves in new directions.  But Mr. Welch is simply telling an important truth about life, not just about GE.<br />The book is an easy and fast read, but offers a lot of food for thought.  There are many humorous and self-deprecating anecdotes.  But Mr. Welch's fierce competitive spirit shines through. For example, on page 207 Mr. Welch writes, &quot;They knew I didn't hold any hard feelings if my ideas got tossed in the basket.&quot;  The editor writes in a note: &quot;The hell you didn't!&quot; But doesn't it say something about Mr. Welch's sense of humor that the note made it into publication?<br />Whether you end up agreeing with him or not, there is a lot to take away from this book and a great many issues to think over.

We seem to be at an unfortunate stage of music history writing. The approach of many books, including this one, is the antithesis of the hero worship books written by the shelf-full not too many decades ago. Do we really need this style of book as an antidote? To me, it seems to belabor the obvious that composers, even the very greatest, such as Brahms, Mahler, and Stravinsky, should be mere mortals after all.<br /><br />Why is it important at all that we point out moments or even decades of pettiness, vainglory, or difficult family relations? How exactly is that supposed to help us understand the art? Why not write a book about a fellow named Bob who lives down your down the street and his ordinary to miserable life?<br />Of course, we don't write about Bob down the street because he is ordinary and he isn't Stravinsky. Haven't we long ago realized that even Stravinsky the composer is something other than Stravinsky the husband, father, or businessman. Of course extraordinary people have much about them that is quite ordinary.<br /><br />Some feel that knowing the artist as a human being helps us understand his art.  Maybe on the margins it could, but only children believe that a composer was necessarily sad when writing a sad piece or happy when writing a happy piece and so on.  Nothing Mr. Joseph tells us about the composition of The Flood helps us understand how it comes out of a Stravinsky. (Even if the author is trying to put forward that in this case it DIDN'T come out of Stravinsky).<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this book by Charles Joseph isn't bad. Really, it has much to recommend it and I am glad that I read it and hope you do too. But I was frustrated by the mixing in of well known stories and photographs into a book that claimed to be revealing new things based upon new access to Stravinsky's papers and artifacts in Basel. It isn't that there isn't anything new or semi-new, it is that it isn't set apart from the ho-hum there's that old chestnut again regurgitation of Stravinsky tales.<br /><br />It is like going to a dinner party and listening across the table to a very knowledgeable guest who tells a few enthralling tales about a very interesting subject, but then spoils the enchantment by going on too long by telling a few too many tales that have no spark or wit about them.<br /><br />Joseph also doesn't follow up on things that ARE really interesting. For example, when he discusses the actual piano music performance scores that Stravinsky used and the interesting fingerings the composer used as a performer. But we don't get a picture of even one page of those piano scores nor do we get even a hint as to why Stravinsky's written in fingerings are telling. As a pianist of sorts, I can surmise why Stravinsky's fingerings would be interesting, but it would be nice to get even a bit of discussion on such an interesting topic. I would have traded all of those re-printed pictures for one or two of the actual new material and one page of the marked-up piano music.<br /><br />Yes, there is a 1983 text available through ProQuest that talks about Stravinsky's piano music, but Mr. Joseph indicates in the book that there were new things learned from his seeing the materials in Switzerland.  In any case, this book is generally available and his 1983 book is not.  Again, why reprint the nude photo of Stravinsky that is NOT original to this book and leave out something that would be valuable and a real contribution such as Stravinsky's piano fingerings?<br /><br />It would be a real service if Mr. Joseph (or SOMEONE) put together an edition of the piano works with those fingerings in them. Not that pianists will necessarily use those precise fingerings, but they would certainly aid in understanding how the composer himself interpreted the piece.<br /><br />Especially annoying to me was yet another tired discussion about Robert Craft. Mr. Joseph does demonstrate that Mr. Craft did play a significant role in the genesis of Stravinsky's work \\"The Flood\\". The author approaches the point of almost intimating that Craft is at least the co-composer of \\"The Flood\\", but never is bold enough to make that accusation. My guess is because for all the support and creative priming that Craft provided for Stravinsky, the evidence is that the composer did indeed compose the music himself. For heaven's sake, every composer since music began based it on some other creative spark or borrowed a theme from another work or even included suggestions from performers for whom the work was written. Composition is not done in a vacuum chamber on the dark side of the moon!<br /><br />However, anyone who knows anything at all about Stravinsky's output from the fifties onward knows that Craft did us all a tremendous service. Why anyone wants to criticize Craft is beyond me. Unless someone wants to make the case that Stravinsky simply signed his name to Craft's scores and present real evidence they should either whine to people who care or thank Craft for the music he enabled Stravinsky to make in the fifties and sixties.<br /><br />All in all, it is too easy for us in our age of sarcasm and witless irony to see the flaws of books that extol our favorite composers as heroes or as flawless paragons of humanity. My suspicion is that it won't take too many more years for people to turn their backs on the recent spate of books that take as their mission the whittling down of the tree of the great artist to a toothpick of a human. It is just too easy to write about human failings. We don't learn much at all about the art from such books and they are tiresome to read.<br /><br />Finally, I am curious about the surmise that I am not a music scholar?  By what definition?  In europe a student is a scholar.  Over here, what is the definition of a scholar?  One who agrees with your points of view?  I happen to have spent seven years at the University of Michigan School of Music and have a degree in music theory and several years of graduate school before my life took a different direction.  But I have always played my piano and kept up on music.  So, my views are not uninformed.ravinsky's work \\"The Flood\\".

But it is even more than that.  It is well written, well documented and eschews sensationalism while giving us a serious understanding of the threats we have faced unknowingly and are facing today.  This is an example of great reporting serving an incredibly important topic.<br />We could have used a lot more reporting on the very real threat of bio-weapons and a lot less on OJ, the poor little model, or the Levy-Condit scandal/mystery.  Don't those topics all seem trivial now?  Well, they were trivial then, but who among us really understood the threat we faced?<br />It turns out that the US did indeed lead the way under President Nixon of abandoning the use and development of bio-weapons.  However, while the signatures were still drying on the treaty banning bio-weapons, the Soviet Union was beginning to build such weapons on a scale no one except those in charge of the project could imagine.  Before it started winding down during the terminal illness of the USSR they had amassed enough toxin to destroy all human life on this planet several times over.  And we thought the only danger was the nuclear arsenals!  The danger for us now is that the expertise for these weapons still exists and is in the heads of Soviet scientists desperately in need of work and money to feed their families.<br />And who is the likely buyer of such expertise?  Well, we now know that Saddam Hussein's Iraq has made enough anthrax and botulinum toxin to kill every human on the planet and are deep at work on a delivery system.  Who knows if Saddam isn't behind the current anthrax attack.  Of course, this book doesn't address such a topic since it went to press before September 11th.<br />My view is that everyone owes it to him or her self to read this book and get up to date on a very real and very serious threat.  These weapons are cheaper to build than nuclear bombs and missiles but are just as deadly.  We must now face the fact that there are people in the world who want every one of us dead and that they will likely mount these kinds of attacks on us until they are successful or we render them incapable of such attacks.  I vote for rendering them incapable through any means necessary to accomplish that goal.<br />This threat is too real and too terrible for us to wait until something stupendously horrible happens from a bio-weapon or chemical attack. Do we have to lose thousands, tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of our citizens to anthrax, small pox, botulinum toxin, or, God forbid, Ebola before our leaders act?  This has to be at least as or even more important than missile defense.<br />However, it is difficult for politicians to take this on because we are so far behind in doing something about it and are at present so helpless. But to hide our heads in the sand and pretend that this grim reality will just go away if we ignore it is morally indefensible and will be fatal to our citizens sometime in the future.  I just fervently pray that it isn't in the near future.<br />We must not over react or panic.  This is a time for seriousness and clear-headed planning.  More of us die every day from driving our cars than have been affected by this present anthrax attack.  Taking antibiotics without a real need is not only a waste, it is a way to undermine our ability to react against attacks in the future by rendering our best drugs impotent.<br />But being calm does not mean to be idle or complacent or ignorant in the face of this terrible threat.<br />Thanks for such a timely and important book for educating those of use who are non-specialists.hat there are people in the world who want every one of us dead and that they will likely mount these kinds of attacks on us until they are successful or we render them incapable of such attacks.

It is a brevity that comes from great mastery rather than carelessness.  This is a wonderful introduction to the horror that is Communism.  It is wonderful because it is NOT a simple condemnation of the idea. Dr. Pipes explains in simple historical terms what happened, what was said, what was promised, what was done, and contributes his succinct insight and analysis.  Nothing is overstated or caricatured even though much has to be summarized.<br />That the story of Communism is one of unimaginable horror is well known by anyone who has been watching the news and reading the history of the past century.<br />This book should whet your appetite for more and Dr. Pipes has many more books that are also worth reading on the history of the USSR and on other topics.  There is also Solzhenitsyn's &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot; series and his other books, the Yale University Press has the terrific &quot;Annals of Communism&quot; series and there is also the recent &quot;The Black Book of Communism&quot;.<br />I recommend all of them, but keep in mind that all of them together still only begin to scratch the surface of this very profound topic.  However, this book is a great way to jump in the lake and get used to the water.<br />Please read it and get others to read it, especially young people who know little to nothing of the horrors inflicted upon humanity in the name of this obscene dogma that we humans inflicted upon ourselves to our great cost and to our eternal shame.	2001-10-09

I have owned this book for a while and just now got around to reading it for a class I am taking on venture capital.  I should have read it sooner, but I am glad that I read it AFTER the web-business meltdown.  It isn't that the book hypes the web or that the guys at Benchmark are wild-eyed web partisans.  In fact, as the web bubble begins to deflate towards the end of the book the author captures some insightful comments from the partners about the shift in focus because of what they saw coming.<br />What is really useful about the book in the context of the post-web-bubble experience is the excellent way it captures the mood and thinking of the time and the story behind some ventures whose outcomes were still unknown when the book was first published.  We now know of e-Bay's staying power and WebVan's demise as well as the stories of several other companies discussed in the book.<br />Benchmark is still going strong with a talented team and an enviable portfolio.  It would be wonderful to get a follow up article (maybe it has already been done) that shows how the Benchmark team handled the heat of the web meltdown and what their current portfolio thinking is.  And, of course, it would be nice to get information on the whys and wherefores of Benchmark's foray into the international arena (it was contemplated in this book and, from the Benchmark website, it is now a reality).<br />This is well done (even if the language is real-life rough) and I am very glad to have read it.  I recommend it highly.	2001-10-02

His writing is sharp and has a power to it that much contemporary writing lacks. Why? Because he works hard to go out and get the background information it takes to tell the truth about something we all share. Most of us do not share the inner-self of a writer who is fixated only upon him- or her- self. That gets boring in a hurry.<br />But in this neat volume we get some wonderful essaygs, a response to the critical savaging Updike, Mailer, and Irving gave &quot;A Man in Full&quot;, a cut scene from the same novel (here it treated as an independent piece and is called a novella), and a sweet telling of some events associated with The New Yorker of the past and present.<br />It is reasonable to like some of the works more than others and it is reasonable to agree with some views and disagree with others. But it is silly to simply bash Wolfe because you would prefer a different writing style. He is a stylist of the first order and has had a positive and energizing impact upon American letters for the past thirty-some years. He is beyond that type of carping.<br />I just wish he would publish more!	2001-09-03

My brother first told me about the show and I watched it and couldn't really follow what it was about. I kept wondering, &quot;what the heck is an Iron Chef?&quot;<br />But the show had me and I kept me coming back.  Slowly I became hooked and started planning my Friday nights to see the show! Even though I know the new shows in the fall will be shows OLDER than the ones we have already seen, we fans will be glued to them throughout the year.<br />This book is a nice backgrounder for the show. It is carefully done to NOT give too much away. After all, they want us to watch the show. And there could be more on each chef to my taste, and there are a couple of errors here and there. But finding them is half the fun!<br />If you are or would like to be an Iron Chef fan (cult member? nut?) this is a good book to feed that appetite.	2001-09-03

The author tells his parents' life story, difficulties and all, with words and especially with wonderful drawings. It is in the style of a comic book, but it is told seriously, with deep emotion and great honesty.<br />It is a treasure and if you have sympathy for working-class folks or have any desire to develop an emotional connection to them, then this books is for you. This wonderful telling of their lives shows them struggling to build a place for themselves in a very harsh world during the Great Depression and WWII and on through the cultural upheavals of the sixties.  They live their lives with courage, pluck, and love.<br />The story has its heartbreaks and there is deep sadness at times, but these were lives admirably lived and the son should be praised for the way he honored his parents with this book.  This book feels like a gift when I read it.<br />Bravo!	2001-09-01

I want to aim my comments to those who at present do not understand these topic but are thinking about reading this wonderful book. If you have the slightest curiosity about the relation between mathmatics and cosmology, please pick up this book and take some time reading it and thinking about its contents. It isn't heavy - it is beautiful. With the six concepts the author teaches us by showing us the numbers you will gain a greater insight into the cosmos than you have ever had (unless you are a professional in cosmology). It will help your reading of any other books on similar subjects and help reveal the true beauty and power of math. This book is on my shelf of treasured books.	2001-08-24

That these two disagree about certain things is just fine with me and if it gets a little personal at times, so what? Consider that just a little spice in the dish. What is wonderful about this book is its concise expression of ideas and concepts and its use of apt illustrations to help us understand the points it makes. Simon Conway Morris obviously cares very deeply about the subject of the book and his skillful writing helps us catch some of that fervor. Whether you end up believe Dr Gould or Dr Conway Morris or make up some other conclusion isn't really the point. You will be better off having read this book (as well as Gould and other authors). This book is a valuable contribution to our understanding of the implications of the Burgess Shale and what we believe we are learning from it and other sites. There are many valuable concepts discussed in this book and valuable references to other reading so you can take your investigations as deep as you care to go. If you read this book I believe you will enjoy it and learn from it.	2001-08-24

No, this book reads like a book half its size because of the fun we have touring the development of the place and the inhabitants who have taken and left its glorious stage through the centuries.<br />If you know London you will love this book and if you don't know London you will learn to love it through reading this book.	2001-08-23

Aren't we thankful for that?  I know I am.<br />This delightful book insightfully reports some of the ways our world culture is changed and re-ordered because of the way the Internet has flattened the structure and availability of information.  Mr. Lewis uses the image of a pancake versus a pyramid.  That is, through the web anyone can be an expert and everyone can communicate with everyone else.  Privileged positions are evaporated.  As he illustrates with several of his vignettes, not only does no one on the Internet know you are a dog, they don't know that the stock trader or the person dispensing legal advice or social theory is a fourteen or fifteen year old typing away from some nook in his parents' house.<br />Mr. Lewis digs deeper than most and his writing has color and bite that is often laugh out loud funny and makes his points vividly.  For example, he digs out the facts and tells a more complete version of the teenage stock trader who was forced by the SEC to pay a quarter of a million dollar fine.  By interviewing Lebed's parents, his accusers at the SEC, and the wunderkind's teenage fellow traders, the author let's us see how the adults flounder in trying to understand what is happening to their world and how the youngsters breath this stuff so naturally they don't even see the revolution they are waging.<br />I think Mr. Lewis's point that the kid wasn't doing anything actually malicious is spot on and that the real \\"crime\\" is that he was using all of the tools available to him more proficiently than the old elite.<br />While I enjoyed every story in the book, the bit about the 10,000 year clock and the Long Now Foundation was particularly and disturbingly funny.  We are shown a bunch of rich over-achievers going through their mid-life crisis by engaging in a bunch of self-important pseudo-intellectual analysis (for example, Stonehenge is a failed monument!).  I won't reveal Mr. Lewis's punch line to this bit, but it is terrific.<br />This is no alarmist piece and there are few bold predictions of the future (except around TiVo and television of the future) and that is wonderfully refreshing after so many years of fully amped hype around the frictionless future.

It is fine reporting of what a westerner needs to know to hope to have a clue in how to get a handle on the east.  Mr. Reid isn't trying to persuade the west to become the east nor is he trying to tell us all there is to know about the east.<br />He energetically reports to us what he and his family learned about the east while he was stationed in Japan as bureau chief for the Washington Post.  It is a very fun read.<br />Of course, if you are deeply familiar with Asia, this book may seem superficial.  How could a work of introduction seem any other way to the initiated?  But for nearly all of us who have lived our lives in the west but have had some exposure (or no exposure!) to the east and would like to understand a bit more about such an important part of our world culture, Mr. Reid has done a great service in giving us a good basis for further investigation.<br />After you read this book your travel and reading about the east will be enriched.  And that is a good enough reason to read and enjoy this book.  It needn't be the all and all tome of the east.  Mr. Reid's argument certainly isn't a book about east versus west.  He is simply trying to use our native understanding of the west to see the east a bit more clearly and then to use the east to let us see ourselves more clearly.<br />After I traveled and spent a couple of years abroad as a young man I could see America much more clearly than I had from simply living in the US.  Over the years I have come to appreciate our country's strengths ever more deeply and I think Mr. Reid does a great job in trying to give that same sense to those who haven't been so fortunate in spending extended time abroad.	2001-08-10

What makes it particularly worthwhile is the way he gives us enough biography to give us a good context for his views and insights into aspects of the way our economy functions - particularly how Wall Street and Washington D.C. function.<br />It isn't a breezy memoir of anecdote and scandal. Instead we get honest consideration, real wit, and prodigious experience. I think it is a book that deserves careful reading and discussion.<br />You may not agree with every conclusion he draws, but since it IS Henry Kaufman they certainly deserve careful consideration and re-consideration. Those interested in finance, especially MBA students, will find that his careful telling of how Wall Street has developed from partnerships to corporations and the rise of derivatives and securitization particularly valuable.<br />If you are insterested in realities about Wall Street and Washington you will find this book engrossing and valuable. You won't be lead astray with glib talk or silly notions designed simply to sell books to the unwary. This is the real stuff.	2001-08-06

It certainly feels authentic to me. It is strange to me how the cultural revolution is remembered differently among several of the chinese I know. Everyone admits it was a tough time, but some are willing to let Mao off the hook in the name of order. Others see Mao as a killer. Hey, they aren't mutually exclusive views! Mao was a killer and he provided order for China.  Which do you prefer, life or order?<br />Like a recession, it is serious when you are unemployed and mild when others are out of work. If you and your family survived without being damaged by the cultural revolution you may think it wasn't all that bad.  However, Da Chen's family was almost destroyed by it.  It seems that all sides would consider this huge historical event a bit more deeply than it appears they do.<br />It seems kind of silly that in a country as large as the US or the even larger China one would categorically say what one family could or could not experience based upon some generalized study of the culture. Life is full of oddities and exceptions. The facts are that under Communism there are totalitarian powers given to the party and those are excersized all the way down to individuals and often in petty, vicious and horrible ways.<br />And to say that because it was Da Chen's grandfather that was the landlord and therefore it wouldn't have affected the author is a very odd criticism given that families, even in the west, carry stigma from outcast ancestors for generations.<br />It would be great to see verification one way or the other, but in any case it is a powerful story of life as an outcast. It is an easy read that you won't want to put down until you finish it.	2001-08-03

Rockefeller, Sr., this book will give you information that will allow you to reassess your views in light of new and better information.  This book helped me understand what it is that Mr. Rockefeller acheived and what he was after.  And it wasn't just money for money's sake.<br />Certainly, there is much about his business practices in building Standard Oil that rankle, but you will be surprised how many of them have become standard business practice (no pun intended).  The point that is often overlooked is that this man helped bring better and less expensive lighting oil to the citizenry than they ever had with whale oil.  And he drove the price of kerosene down and still made money.  We shout for better prices for consumers today, don't we?<br />Mr.Chernow also takes us through great accounts of the breakup of Standard Oil and how the advent of the automobile made him richer than ever.  The accounts of his building Spelman College, the University of Chicago, the Rockefeller Medical center and more are worth reading.  As are the family's connections to some of the largest banks in our country.<br />Reading about John D. Rockefeller, Jr.'s path in life is absorbing and bracing.  The tragedy (massacre) at CFI is awful and the way Junior faced that and went to Colorado and spoke with the people face to face is evidence of great character.<br />There is something here for everyone to learn about this important man and a family that has an important role in our country to this day.	2001-07-22

I enjoyed this book more than I thought I would and I can recommend it to everyone.  It is an easy read and will provoke some thought whether you are liberal or conservative.  However, I can only give it three stars instead of the four I would like to give it because the author engages in too much agenda grinding rather than honest reporting.<br />For example, she hates drug tests and admits to smoking marijuana.  Now being against drug tests is one thing, but to say that they are an abuse of the lower classes is, I think, a sign of cultural provincialism.  Try and get a job at ...or many other well-paying jobs without taking a drug test.  In fact, the modern workplace gives many people on both sides of the political spectrum cause for concern for their personal rights.  However, employers also have good arguments for their need to know especially in the face of lawsuits involving what the employer should have known.  There is pain for all involved.<br />She also never talks about the fact that not all jobs are meant to be for the full support of families.  There are many people in the workplace for many different reasons.  Her discussions of economics touch on the usual liberal articles of faith, but she seems to have no idea what an indifference curve is or what it implies.  Simply, people take jobs not because they are made to, but because they prefer taking the job to the other opportunities available to them.  They are free to leave it anytime they wish, as they often do at the low end of the pay scale.  As she herself did from a waitress gig.  People should be encouraged to trade-up on jobs!<br />Mainly, she writes about her personal experiences in getting and learning these jobs.  When she is reporting it is good.  When she is grousing about her personal preferences she is less than good.  Obviously, she is not really cut out for the jobs she took, especially the cleaning job, and it shows through in her writing.  Another thing she never learned, because she never kept the jobs long enough, is that physical jobs become EASIER after a period of months.  She didn&#8217;t dig deeply enough about the truth of these work experiences.  My guess is that her cultural prejudice blinded her in part, and also because she didn&#8217;t have the energy to do the extra work necessary.<br />I remember when I first began working on the line at a Ford plant.  It was miserable for the first month or two, and then it got easier.  It became easier because my body adapted and even more because I learned how to work the job.  She never worked a job more than a month so she reports an incomplete picture and comes across as a working tourist.  Those of us from the working class who have done that work know that she doesn&#8217;t truly understand the experience.  But at least she tries to understand and that is more than most.<br />But her prescriptions are too facile.  She is all for unions and higher minimum wages as cures.  ....  We also do not need higher minimum wages although they seem so attractive to workers.  They really do result in limiting the mix and flexibility of the employment opportunities available.<br />What we DO need is to educate children from their earliest school days about money, about work, and about their right to say no and find other employment.  Just don&#8217;t take jobs you hate.  And work your way up the employment ladder by all available means.  Don&#8217;t think you OWE things to your employer beyond an honest day&#8217;s work.  It would be a wonderful day when these awful employers have to close down because everyone says no to them.  Of course, their greed would force them to change.  But the key is to prepare yourself so you can say no because you have the reserves and opportunities to move on.<br />Read this book.  Think about it.  But don&#8217;t drink too deeply of the kool-aid she presents.  It isn&#8217;t the whole picture.  The working class life is both better and worse than she presents.  But at least it is a lively and sympathetic view into the situation.ast it is a lively and sympathetic view into the situation.	2001-07-17

I proudly declare that I am a long time fan of William F. Buckley Jr. and that this is a very good book. This story is a very enjoyable read. The writing is fine, as one would expect from reading Mr. Buckley's forty books. But this story also has an emotional tone that is, if not sad, at least elegiac. Its nostalgic melancholy sounds a new chord in Mr. Buckley's compositions. There was a touch of it in Tucker's Last Stand and Brothers No More, but this is softer and even a bit, well, if not sweet at least sweeter. I loved it.<br />Elvis is treated with respect and honesty while the character Mr. Buckley creates, Orson Killere, stands in for the Baby Boomers who were and still are fans of the King. This isn't the place for an analysis of all the ways Orson embodies my generation, but he is wonderfully drawn. You will enjoy getting to know him for his strengths and even his all-too-human weaknesses.<br />Thanks, Mr. Buckley for another gem.	2001-06-26

Why worry about the Soviet Union or facism?  Because the error of believing in strong central planning leads to real misery on a massive scale.  This means real lives and real people are ground up in the machinery of a state bureaucracy that is pursuing horribly misguided ends by cruel and ridiculous means.<br />Mr. Conquest does a wonderful job in aiding our cultural memory.

So, maybe our experience of exhaustion, anxiety, and struggle have different sources, but they are similar enough.<br />I haven't found b-school to be hell.  In fact, I have enjoyed it a great deal and have learned many things that I am already applying to my day job.  But there is no getting around the fact that an MBA, especially in one of the top programs, isn't a picnic.  Good reading, good writing, good fun.

He was willing to capitalize on his insight, push his dream, make his fortune, and then ... stop.  He retained his sense of himself and his faith until the end.  And he didn't let the making of the fortune become his life's treasure.  He reamined, according to this book, a modest man who understood what he was about and used his material success to benefit his family and others.<br />There are also interesting lessons to be learned about comparative advantage between nations and how internal and international political pressures create results that are not understood or even seen clearly until they become all too clear.<br />Worth the read.

It is well written and easy to read.  If you are interested in early Mormonism and the origins of what used to be called the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (RLDS), this is a good source.<br />However, it does have some gaps.  It doesn't give us much about his mother and their relationship.  It doesn't really delve into the man's spiritual life beyond what he did when and only talks about his revelations as they affect some program he was trying to bring about.<br />But I was very interested to learn about his role in the persecution of the Utah Saints in trying to end polygamy. And I did find it kind of funny that a man who was obsessed with others having more than one wife ended up having three and children with two of them.  The last one being far younger than him.

It talks about each President's strengths and how each of them got themselves into trouble and it illustrates its points using each President's own words. Because it is less than 400 pages long it is hard for Doyle to support all the claims he makes, but it is still worth reading.  More than that, it is worth owning and re-reading.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I think the book could have gone a bit deeper into each presidency without adding too much length.  It was just a bit too much this side of a tourist's guide to each presidency.<br />But there are so many wonderful and new insights that I feel guilty for not giving it five stars.

For these folks, this is a nicely written and easy to read hagiography. It is a biography of modest size and spends its time on the life Marx lived and is therefore necessarily light on the man's philosophy. The author, for whom Marx is obviously a great hero, shapes Marx's life into something almost pitiable. However, Marx's solipsism is so pervasive that no amount of beatification can hide all the outsized selfishness.<br /><br />Wheen is a writer of many gifts and clearly wants the world to take a favorable view of Marx. If this book is all you read about this man, well, you might be persuaded.<br /><br />Some try to let Marx off the hook by saying he wasn't as bad as the even greater monsters who claim him as their philosophical father. However, it seems to me that guiltier sons often surpass the still quite guilty father. But the Marxist philosophy is really beyond the scope of this book so that is debate for another time.<br /><br />The author does clear up some nagging biographical details such as Marx's relationship with Darwin (nominal at best) and is open about the suicdes of his surviving daughters (sad and pathetic). This honesty and the skill and humor of the writing give the book merit. To my mind Marx's life itself really hasn't much to say beyond the philosophy to which it gave rise. And, it seems to me, this book's discussion of that philosophy is facile at best. However, others obviously disagree with me. I am glad that I read this book even though I strongly disagree with the subject's philosophy and the author's point of view.<br /><br />Disagreement is a wonderful part of our free society, isn't it?	2001-04-30

Killing the Dream is a great read as well as being animportant book about this tragic assassination.  Even though Posnerhas meticulously documented everything in the book he keeps the detail out of the reader's way.  The author keeps a nice flow in the narrative while making it easy to check the documentary references. Posner's ability to make a well documented book fun to read is a great skill that not many authors possess.<br /><br /> Through this book we get to know James Earl Ray at every stage of his life.  We see Ray becoming a petty criminal by growing up in a family of criminals.  We follow his life as a fumbling loner and see that this is his nature both before and after the assassination.  Ray's present pathetic attempts at vindication become understandable as part of his lifelong efforts to avoid responsibility for his criminal acts.<br /><br /> Posner wisely lets Ray's actions and the documentary evidence speak the truth rather than vainly speculating about the assassin's psychology.  We see for ourselves the type of person Ray is and the choices he made while avoiding accountability for his crimes.  By seeing the context of Ray's entire life the monstrous act of killing Dr. King becomes understandable as the misbegotten attempt of a loser trying to make a big score.<br /><br /> Sometimes it is hard to accept the mundane nature of evil, but Posner has done us the service of telling us the truth.  The simple dignity of reality gives an historical weight to this telling of the crime that none of the sensationalists will ever achieve.  People who want to know the truth will want to read this book.  Others will endlessly babble their fantasies and allow themselves to be exploited by Oliver Stone and his ilk.	1998-04-21
