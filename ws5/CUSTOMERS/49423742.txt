Recent US studies show that greater inequality is linked to increased mortality rates, violent crime, poor educational outcomes, teenage pregnancies and obesity. The facts are familiar. But what to do?<br /><br />The editors of this collection of essays claim that we need \\"the establishment of people-centred solidarity networks across the world ... a global movement for health and social justice. ... By globalizing the struggle, we can all create a different world ...\\" This is Trotsky's `permanent revolution', that you can't have a revolution unless everyone has one - which equals, you can't have a revolution. Workers need to oppose these promoters of globalisation just as much as we need to oppose its more obvious agents like the IMF, the World Trade Organization and the European Union.<br /><br />The authors deplore `the extraction of human capital from Africa during the slave trade', but accept today's similar extraction of skilled labour. The Blair government, in true colonial fashion, strips developing countries of their skilled people, their most precious asset, robbing Zimbabwe for example of more than half its trained nurses. Countries should follow Cuba's example, where those trained in Cuba have to work either there or in a less developed country, and they take from no country which is short of doctors and nurses.<br /><br />Of the 21 contributors to this collection, 15 are American academics - not one of whom identifies herself as a member of a trade union. These latter-day missionaries and do-gooders are telling the health workers of all nations not to make revolution in their own country but to become `global health activists'.<br /><br />Health workers don't need `the establishment of people-centred solidarity networks across the world' or `a global movement for health and social justice'. We need strong trade unions rooted in their working classes.

Hoeller praises Jung - the well-known Nazi-supporter and racialist - as some kind of guru of freedom, because of his supposed insights into alchemy. Alchemy was just medieval speculation about the origins of life and the 'meaning' of minerals. Hoeller tells us in tedious detail about Jung's entirely subjective views of the 'meaning' of alchemy, as if they were some kind of mystical key to understanding the world! The fact that the reactionary Irridium (who is clearly ashamed to tell us his real name, for good reason) praises this tosh tells you all that you need to know about it.	2005-09-30

Hayek proves to his own satisfaction, if nobody else's, that any state that takes any care of its citizens is doomed to become a totalitarian monster. So he sees Britain's wonderful National Health Service as a harbinger of doom, rather than as a highly successful organisation to reduce avoidable suffering. So Bush's grotesquely hopeless attempts to cope with the effects of Hurricane Katrina would be fine with Hayek, because Bush's policies are laisser-faire, ie do nothing, pass by on the other side. In sum, don't bother with reactionary losers like Hayek; read humane thinkers like Keynes or Marx instead.	2005-09-23

She praises the pre-modern world because it understood that there were two ways of arriving at truth, Plato's myths (mythos) and science (logos). But mythos is not a way of arriving at truth; it is an idealist philosophy which undermines knowledge and science by boosting belief and faith (i.e. wishful thinking and self-deception).<br /><br />She writes, \\"our education and society is [sic] fuelled entirely by logos.\\" If only this was true! In the real world, we have a government full of religious zealots, pushing for faith schools that promote segregation and superstition.<br /><br />The ancient illusions of religion and idealism are still with us and are still dangerous.

Some relevant background: in the 1980s, the Thatcher government allowed the mujehadin to open recruiting offices, under the name Al Kifah, in London. In 1994, Osama bin Laden took advantage of Home Office laxness to use London as a base for his terrorist operations.<br /><br />London-based Abu Hamza, who openly supports bin Laden, is head of the `Supporters of Shariah'. He tries to recruit young British Muslims for terrorist training and operations.<br /><br />The Hizb Ut Tahrir organisation claims to be peaceful, yet one of its recent leaflets said, \\"The head of the matter is Islam, its pillar is the prayer and its highest peak is Jihad.\\" Another said, \\"That the world should end is less in the sight of Allah than the killing of a Muslim.\\" And \\"The Hizb can see the Khilafah on the horizon, by the will of Allah (Subhanahu Wa Ta'aala). At that time no Kafir colonialist would dare to attack the Muslims' lands, let alone occupy them. Rather, they would not be able to prevent the Muslim army from bringing the Light of Islam in their homeland, by Jihad and the clear conquest.\\" (Kafir is Arabic for infidel.) But the Blair government has made no attempts to ban its publications or to question any of its senior officials.<br /><br />Last year's head of the Islamic Society at Kingston University, when asked why he did not inform the Students' Union or the University about Hizb Ut Tahrir's activities at the University, replied, \\"What could we have done, tell me? You're telling us to go to the Kafir against a Muslim, is that what you are saying we should have done?\\" This identification with the co-religionist as against the infidel puts a value only on the lives of believers. It is at root inhuman.<br /><br />The atrocities committed by Al Qaeda and its sympathisers are not acts of war, not retaliation for the war on Iraq, as their apologists claim.

One of the Make Poverty History campaign's demands is \\"make laws to stop big business profiting at the expense of people and the environment.\\" This reveals the naivety, not to say connivance, of those behind the campaign. Big business exists in order to profit at the expense of people. It has no other purpose. No law is going to stop it doing what it depends on doing.<br /><br />The Blair government is trying to exploit this campaign, covering itself with the odour of sanctity. But what is it really doing?<br /><br />At the World Trade Organisation, the Labour government led the EU, in alliance with US financial companies, in drawing up the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). GATS' purpose is to enforce private capital's access to whatever it defines as services. This covers just about everything, including schools, hospitals, social services, energy, food supply and 157 other areas. The European Commission confirmed, \\"GATS is ... first and foremost an instrument for the benefit of business.\\" GATS would forbid governments to foster national industries and it would impose privatisation everywhere, overriding nations' sovereignties.<br /><br />GATS is supposed to be beyond democratic control, forever. For example, voters in Britain might oppose US firms taking over British hospitals under WTO rules, but neither they nor their MPs would legally be able to do anything about it.<br /><br />The EU has identified those countries that oppose GATS and is whipping them into line, with the Labour government's full approval. This is what the Labour government is really doing, behind the clouds of saintly rhetoric. Have we not yet learnt that this government is only committed to maximising big business's profits?<br /><br />The events of the first week in July aroused massive expectations, which capitalist governments cannot possibly deliver. The Churches too jumped onto the bandwagon. The Make Poverty History march in Edinburgh on 2 July was addressed by Cardinal Keith O'Brien, head of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland, Cardinal Cormac Murphy O'Connor, head of the Roman Catholic Church in England, and the Reverend David Lacy, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. As if this was not enough, a message from Pope Benedict XVI was read out. The answers lie not in religion or in charity or in international networks. Instead, the people of each country must take action on their own behalf, to solve their own problems. They must not wait for, or rely on, others to save them. Neither the G8, nor international banks, nor Gordon Brown, nor God will help. They have to take responsibility for running their own affairs.th O'Brien, head of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland, Cardinal Cormac Murphy O'Connor, head of the Roman Catholic Church in England, and the Reverend David Lacy, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.

But unfortunately, the authors appear to oppose the EU on the grounds that it prevents the freedom of movement of capital, labour, services and goods.<br /><br />However, the `Constitution for Europe' actually enshrines these four freedoms. It makes the basic principle of laissez-faire - free competition across national borders on the basis of free movement of capital, labour, services and goods - into a constitutional obligation (Articles I-3 and 4, Articles III-130, 166 and 167).<br /><br />Under the Constitution, the European Central Bank's sole brief is monetarist - to ensure price stability, not to rebuild industry, achieve economic growth or create full employment (Article III-185). Its Article III-147 allows the EU to enforce `liberalisation' of public services like health, education and social services. Article II-88 provides that workers have rights only `in accordance with Union law and national laws and practices'.<br /><br />The authors back the worst aspects of the EU - deregulation, the single market, cutting down the unions, the Bolkestein Services Directive. They support the Thatcherism of `free trade, non-interventionism and competition'.<br /><br />They acknowledge that their preferred policies would destroy our manufacturing industry: \\"competition under free trade largely eliminates manufacture.\\" They praise government policy: \\"In our economy we have largely let market forces take effect, with generally favourable results for employment and growth (!); as a result we have let manufacturing go where it was essentially uneconomic.\\"<br /><br />The authors support the government approach of using cheap foreign labour to produce our manufactured goods and using cheap immigrant labour to provide our services. This is a new imperialism.<br /><br />They don't explain how we in Britain could assert and keep our sovereignty and independence if we no longer produced anything, if we depended on other countries for all our goods and food.ow we in Britain could assert and keep our sovereignty and independence if we no longer produced anything, if we depended on other countries for all our goods and food. <br /> <br />	2005-08-03

He looks at the Franco-American dispute, the question of US imperialism, 9/11, the preparations for the attack on Iraq, the war and the subsequent occupation, and the future of the international system.<br /><br />He writes that after 9/11, \\"the road selected by the United States was that of a declaration of `war' against terrorism, the creation of the notion of `illegal combatants', and the assimilation of states suspected of sheltering terrorists to the terrorists themselves. This was playing into their hands.\\"<br /><br />He suggests, \\"It is time to refocus the struggle against terrorism, by giving priority to the fight against Islamic jihadists (the most dangerous for U.S. and Western interests), and by spending far more energy on a permanent solution to the Palestinian problem, along the lines almost agreed upon at Taba in 2001 and advocated by the Geneva informal alliance of Palestinians and Israelis, as well as by Jimmy Carter.\\"<br /><br />He notes, \\"Nothing wholly good can come out of a war that resulted from a mix of self-deception and deliberate deception, waged in a part of the world in which alien control has for a long time fostered turmoil and tragedy. The presence of terrorism is not an invitation to empire, but an incentive for finding policies that reduce its appeal, and for pursuing the terrorists in ways that do not help them multiply. In the case of the Middle East, an exit from Iraq, combined with a new effort by the U.S., the U.N., the EU, and Russia to end the Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands and to create a livable Palestinian state, would mark a return to reality, to good sense, and to morality.\\"<br /><br />He concludes with some sensible proposals. He writes of Iraq, \\"There are good reasons for calling for the end of the occupation. As in Palestine, the occupation is the main cause of the current troubles (which does not mean that they will end if we leave; but whatever we do to try to resolve the internal conflicts is likely to backfire). Continuing U.S. military control, direct or indirect, will feed anti-Americanism (as in post-1965 South Vietnam) and provide a training and breeding ground for terrorism, native and from other countries. American interests would be better served by a shift of U.S. resources toward ... the fight against al Qaeda and its allies around the world - who have become more diversified and decentralized and continue to receive manpower and support from schools and factions in officially pro-American states such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.\\"<br /><br />We do indeed need to focus on defeating Islamic jihadists. The barbaric bombing of Londoners on Thursday 7 July is to be utterly condemned, without qualification. The inhuman fascists who carried out, or connived in, these acts, wish to push us into a dark age of unreason and fear. They will try to blame their inhumanity on others.

Goff, who used to be a soldier in Army Special Operations, analyses the US state's wars in Korea, Vietnam, Latin America, Somalia, Haiti and Iraq.<br /><br />In Korea, General MacArthur ordered his forces to \\"destroy every means of communication, every installation, factory, city and village from the front line to the Yalu River.\\" General Curtis LeMay boasted, \\"We burned down just about every city in North and South Korea both, and ... we killed off over a million civilian Koreans and drove several million more from their homes.\\" The USAF dropped more bombs on Korea than on all Europe in all of World War Two and dropped 7.8 million gallons of napalm. US forces killed about four million Koreans, as against `only' three million Vietnamese people.<br /><br />After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) faced huge problems. The US state maintained its punitive sanctions. Russia cut its oil supplies by 90%. In 1995, the country suffered the worst floods for a century, which swept away more than 400,000 hectares of prime farmland just before harvest time and made five million people homeless. In 1996, there were more floods and in 1997 a severe drought destroyed 70% of the country's corn. In 2000-01, the country suffered the worst drought in its history.<br /><br />Despite all these hardships, the DPRK honoured its commitment under the 1994 Agreement with the USA to suspend its plutonium production facilities. The US state, on the other hand, broke its promises by failing to supply the promised alternative energy sources, failing to normalise relations and targeting the DPRK with nuclear weapons. The DPRK had warned that if the USA reneged, it would restart its nuclear power programme. In 2002, Bush named the DPRK as a target in its Nuclear Posture Review. The DPRK then stated that it had the right to develop nuclear weapons in self-defence. (The USA has had nuclear weapons in South Korea since 1958).<br /><br />Goff also has some brilliant insights into how the American working class can defeat this imperial and anti-American US state. \\"The most important quality in a leader is the aggressive tenacity that never loses sight of the mission, combined with the creativity to achieve it.\\" He attacks the `left' for \\"their utter lack of aggression and their constant moral hand-wringing ... they only know how to mobilize fear that demoralizes people, instead of mobilizing rage that drives through fear and seizes the initiative.\\"lear weapons in South Korea since 1958). <br /> <br />Goff also has some brilliant insights into how the American working class can defeat this imperial and anti-American US state. \\"The most important quality in a leader is the aggressive tenacity that never loses sight of the mission, combined with the creativity to achieve it.\\" He attacks the `left' for \\"their utter lack of aggression and their constant moral hand-wringing ... they only know how to mobilize fear that demoralizes people, instead of mobilizing rage that drives through fear and seizes the initiative.\\" <br />	2005-07-30

Unless a war is authorised by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, or justified under Article 51 of the Charter it is unlawful.\\" The Security Council never authorised the attack on Iraq, nor was it justified under Article 51, which upholds the right to use force in self-defence. So the war was illegal.<br /><br />Further, as the Attorney-General admitted in his Confidential Note to Blair of 26 March 2003, \\"it must be borne in mind that the lawfulness of any occupation after the conflict has ended is still governed by the legal basis for the use of force.\\" As the attack was unlawful, so the ensuing war against the Iraqi people's sovereignty and political independence is unlawful.<br /><br />Security Council Resolution 1483 of 22 May 2003 did not legitimise the invasion or the occupation. It called on the occupying powers to conduct the occupation in accordance with international law. Similarly, the UN has not legitimised the Israeli occupation when it called on Israel to conduct its occupation of the occupied territories in accordance with international law. Resolution 1483 stressed \\"the right of the Iraqi people freely to determine their own political future and control their own natural resources\\" and asserted \\"that the day when Iraqis govern themselves must come quickly\\".<br /><br />Now the Bush and Blair governments are preparing further wars. Their rationale for attacking Iran is that it should not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons. But, as Colin Warbrick, Professor of Law at Durham University, stated at the Citizens' Inquiry, \\"a state is entitled to develop, obtain and deploy any weapons as an exercise of its sovereignty. Even if a State develops weapons in breach of a treaty, say the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, there is no right in international law for a State to use forcible counter-measures against the wrong-doing State by reason of its illegality alone.\\"lves must come quickly\\". <br /> <br />Now the Bush and Blair governments are preparing further wars.

Although the government has speculated that this clause may not be brought into force for some years, there is no time period established in the Bill. Parliament could approve the order to do so at any time it wishes.\\"<br /><br />The Report sums up, \\"Many of the public interest objectives of the Bill would be more effectively achieved by other means. For example, preventing identity theft may be better addressed by giving individuals greater control over the disclosure of their own personal information, while prevention of terrorism may be more effectively managed through strengthened border patrols and increased presence at borders, or allocating adequate resources for conventional police intelligence work.<br /><br />\\"The technology envisioned for this scheme is, to a large extent, untested and unreliable. No scheme on this scale has been undertaken anywhere in the world. Smaller and less ambitious systems have encountered substantial technological and operational problems that are likely to be amplified in a large-scale, national system. The use of biometrics gives rise to particular concern because this technology has never been used at such a scale. ... A fully integrated national system of this complexity and importance will be technologically precarious and could itself become a target for attacks by terrorists or others.\\"<br /><br /> \\"Any system that supports critical security functions must be robust and resilient to malicious attacks. Because of its size and complexity, the identity system would require security measures at a scale that will result in substantially higher implementation and operational costs than has been estimated. The proposed use of the system for a variety of purposes, and access to it from a large number of private and public sector organisations will require unprecedented attention to security.<br /><br />\\"All identity systems carry consequential dangers as well as potential benefits. Depending on the model used, identity systems may create a range of new and unforeseen problems.

Taylor shows that Dresden was an important military, political and industrial centre, contributing significantly to the Nazi war effort. Taylor also puts the US/British bombing raid in context, showing how it was a major part of their war effort, even though it was less significant than the Soviet Union's heroic struggles. For example, in late 1944, after D-Day, 91 Allied divisions were fighting 65 German divisions across a 400-kilomtere front, while 560 Russian divisions were fighting 235 German divisions across a 3,200-kilomtere front.<br /><br />Putting Dresden into context, it should not be forgotten who started the War and what kind of a war it was that Hitler started. In 1939 Hitler had told the Wehrmacht high command, \\"Poland will be depopulated ... the fate of Russia will be exactly the same.\\"<br /><br />After the Allies' bombing of Dresden, the Final Report by the Dresden Police and the SS, dated 15 March 1945, estimated 25,000 dead. Goebbels added an extra zero, making the publicised total 250,000. He did the same with the number of bodies cremated in the Altmarkt - thus 6,856 became 68,560. He lied in similar fashion about the numbers of people killed in the Soviet Union in the 1930s. All too many authors have let themselves be taken in by Goebbels' lies that about 20 million people were killed.<br /><br />All in all, this is a fine book.	2005-06-15

Article 22(4) of the Covenant of the League of Nations (1919), the 1922 Mandate for Palestine and the Treaty of Lausanne (1923) recognised that all Arab territories of the former Ottoman provinces, including Palestine, were to be granted freedom as provisionally independent nations. As the Covenant asserted, \\"their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognised.\\" This was reaffirmed in the UN Charter, Article 80(1).<br /><br />What then is the root of the problem in the Middle East? On 7 October 2000 the Security Council adopted Resolution 1322 by 14 votes to nil, with the USA abstaining. In Paragraph 1 the Council \\"Deplores the provocation carried out at Al-Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem on 28 September and the subsequent violence there ... \\" Thereby it held Ariel Sharon's provocative visit to the Temple Mount responsible for starting the current round of warfare. In Paragraph 3 the Council called Israel `the occupying power'. The UN recognises Israel as only a belligerent occupant of Palestine's land, with no sovereign rights there.<br /><br />The condition of Israel's original admission to the UNO was its acceptance of Resolution 181(II) 1947 on partition and Resolution 194(III) 1948 on the Palestinians' right of return. Israel has now expressly repudiated both Resolutions, violating its condition for admission to UN membership.<br /><br />Israel is trying to impose a colonial deal on the Palestinians like the `independence' agreements that the British government in the 1950s imposed on the Cypriot government, that British military bases there were to be sovereign British, not Cypriot, territory.<br /><br />And what is the source of the problem in the Middle East? Not some original Arab sin of lacking the culture of democracy or any other colonialist insult, but the British Empire. As Boyle sums up, the \\"political problems of the Middle East ... were created by Britain's irresponsible, illegal and void ab initio attempt to terminate the Mandate for Palestine unilaterally.\\"ible, illegal and void ab initio attempt to terminate the Mandate for Palestine unilaterally.\\"  <br />	2005-05-18

Books	5	4	4	N	N	Fine demolition of recent justification for imperial wars	Certain academics have developed the `Democratic Peace Proposition' (DPP) which purports to prove that democratic states are less likely to fight wars than undemocratic states.<br /><br />Presidents Clinton and Bush have used the DPP to justify their wars of aggression. They claimed that their attacks were really wars for peace because by imposing democracy they increased the forces for peace. Like `humanitarian intervention', this notion of peace through war fails in practice.<br /><br />Henderson's study proves that those states labelled democracies, especially the US and British states, are in fact more likely to start wars than non-democracies. He also shows in particular that, contrary to US/British state propaganda, Muslim states are not more bellicose than others.<br /><br />But what counts as a war? Previous research into the DPP has only counted wars between states as wars. This let imperial states like Britain, France and the USA off the hook by excluding all their wars against colonised peoples. To imperialism, some wars and some people's deaths don't count, so neither the wars nor the deaths are counted.<br /><br />What counts as a democracy? The DPP also assumes that we know which states are democratic and which aren't. So the USA, whose President was chosen in 2000 only by a majority of the Supreme Court, not by the people, will be called democratic, whereas Cuba, the most democratic state in the world, would not.<br /><br />There was peace between the USA and the USSR from 1921 - the end of the Wars of Intervention - to 1991. Does the DPP then mean that the Soviet Union must have been democratic? Or did some other factor, the Soviet nuclear bomb for instance, deter the US state from attacking?<br /><br />As for Britain, how democratic is a state whose leader gets away with making and carrying out a secret agreement with a foreign power to attack another state illegally?	2005-05-13

It looks at the evidence, examining US policy towards Latin America, focusing on Colombia.<br /><br />Chapter 1 explores various interpretations of US foreign policy, conservative, liberal and radical. Chapters 2 and 3 show how the USA's aims in Latin America were the same during and after the Cold War. Chapter 4 shows how in the 1980s the US state backed state terrorism across Latin America, including in Guatemala where government forces killed 200,000 people. During Colombia's 1980s peace process, the US state aided and trained Colombia's army: by the end of the 1990s, Colombia got the third largest amount of US military aid, helping its army and its allied paramilitaries to kill tens of thousands.<br /><br />The US state's motives were and are material: the open door for US and European corporations, access to oil. Colombia supplies 3% of US oil imports. BP pays paramilitaries to protect its pipelines. Attacking Colombia also puts pressure on Venezuela, which has 7.4% of the world's oil reserves - and also has a patriotic government that runs its own oil industry.<br /><br />Only the US state's pretexts have changed. Until 1991 it was anti-communism. In the 1990s it was the `war on drugs' - as a US Special Forces trainer said, \\"the counter-narcotics thing was an official cover story.\\" After 9/11 it was the `war on terror'.<br /><br />The US Drug Enforcement Administration \\"has no evidence that [the insurgents] have been involved in the transportation, distribution, or marketing of illicit drugs in the United States or Europe.\\" The Council on Hemispheric Affairs and the UN Drug Control Programme agree that drugs are smuggled into the USA by the US state's allies - \\"right-wing paramilitary groups in collaboration with wealthy drug barons, the armed forces, key financial figures and senior government bureaucrats.\\"<br /><br />The US state's allies are also the main terrorists.

Elkins details the government `campaign of terror, dehumanizing torture, and genocide' marked by detention without trial, forced labour, collective punishments, deprivation of medical care, systematic starvation and murders.<br /><br />The colonial government stole the Kenyan people's land, starved them and then blamed them for not feeding their children properly. Using the same tactics as in South Africa and Malaya, the imperial forces torched the homes of a million Kenyans then forcibly resettled them into compounds behind barbed wire.<br /><br />The people resisted and fought for their freedom. The judge at the nationalist leaders' trial, who got £20,000 for his verdict, admitted that it was a national liberation struggle when he denounced `this foul scheme of driving the Europeans from Kenya'.<br /><br />The British government demonised all who opposed colonialism as `terrorists'. It detained without trial up to 320,000 people in punishment camps, where the official policy was systematic brutality, using sexual violence and humiliation. Guards were indoctrinated into a fascist mentality, describing and treating Africans as animals. The assistant police commissioner said that camp conditions were worse than he had experienced in Japanese POW camps.<br /><br />Critics asked how many camps were run by British forces. How many people had been arrested and detained? On what charges? Were they made to work in the camps? If so, for how long and in what conditions? Was there any disease or malnutrition in the camps? Were there any deaths?<br /><br />The British government tried to maintain the absolute virtue of its rule by admitting nothing, lying systematically. `Incidents' of abuse were always `isolated', carried out by the lowest members of the colonial hierarchy. It set up powerless internal inquiries run by those responsible for the atrocities. It smeared nationalist leaders, witnesses and critics as `self-interested' and `prejudiced'.<br /><br />The Empire was no civilising mission; it was a way to steal other people's land and labour power and murder them when they resisted., lying systematically. `Incidents' of abuse were always `isolated', carried out by the lowest members of the colonial hierarchy.

And who committed this crime? The pious, canting, hypocritical Christian rulers of the British Empire!<br /><br />Throughout the 19th century, the British ruling class paid for its ever more expensive empire by producing opium in India and exporting it to China. The British state promoted, protected and profited from the trade. Revenue from the opium trade financed all its governments in Southeast Asia.<br /><br />By the 1830s, opium was the largest commerce of the time in any single commodity. In 1860, the British Indian government legalised India's narcotics trade with China as a government monopoly, run by the Opium Department. It became the Indian government's second largest source of revenue.<br /><br />Trocki wrote, \\"So long as there was considerable profit in the drug, the enterprise was protected and given a safe haven in British India. ... the continued legal production of the drug in  British India effectively prevented the eradication of drug use elsewhere.\\" \\"if Britain did not provide a safe and legal haven for the trade, it could not flourish.\\"<br /><br />\\"The records show that the Indian government and the Colonial Office were constantly at pains to maximize profits and to protect, at almost any cost, the opium revenue of India. ... British authorities fought tenacious battles throughout the 1890s and into the twentieth century to preserve the opium system against reformers or opponents. So long as the British government profited from and perpetuated the opium industry, there could be no stopping it. It was the persistence in protecting the trade and preserving the revenues that seems the most reprehensible element of British policy during these years.\\"<br /><br />He concludes, \\"without the drug, there probably would have been no British Empire.\\" \\"In their dreams, the empire, the Raj, was a great and glorious enterprise. It was also a global drug cartel which enslaved and destroyed millions and enriched only a few. The image of the Raj was itself a delusion created by opium.\\"<br /><br /> And now the present pious, canting, hypocritical Christian rulers of Britain have the gall to praise the global drug cartel that was the Empire!g cartel which enslaved and destroyed millions and enriched only a few.

How could we vote to re-elect as Prime Minister a man who should be tried and sentenced for the war crime of waging an illegal war of aggression?<br /><br />Sands opens with a brief introduction to the story of international law since 1945. He then looks at the Pinochet case, the creation of the International Criminal Court in 1998, the Kyoto Protocol, the rules imposing global free trade and protecting overseas investments, `the utter lawlessness at Guant&aacute;namo Bay' (as Lord Steyn, the law lord, rightly called it), the illegal attack on Iraq, and the systematic torture carried out under US government orders at Abu Ghraib and other torture chambers.<br /><br />Sands shows how capitalism uses international law as cover for what it wants to do - invade and threaten other countries, and protect companies' investments by overriding the national independence and sovereignty of countries protecting their industries, services and people. But the UN Charter, with its strong defence of peace between sovereign nations, does not suit capitalism's interests. So the Bush administration is trying to create a new legal regime allowing the US state to do exactly what it wants.<br /><br />A group of international lawyers, including Professor Sands, wrote to Blair in March 2003 saying, \\"There is no justification under international law for the use of military force against Iraq. ... Neither Security Council resolution 1441 nor any prior resolution authorizes the proposed use of force in the present circumstances.\\"<br /><br />Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's Representative to the UN, stated of 1441, \\"There is no `automaticity' in this Resolution.\\" Even John Negroponte, the US Representative to the UN, said it contained no `hidden triggers'. Nor did a summation of resolutions 660, 678, 687 and 1441 authorise the attack on Iraq, despite Jack Straw's claims.<br /><br />Iraq had attacked nobody and threatened nobody.

Southwark is London's oldest borough, after the City and Westminster; it housed the produce, the smells and noise, the leper hospitals, prisons, Bedlam, brothels, bars and theatres that the City and Westminster rejected. Hours were long and lives were short: seven-year olds worked 14 hours a day, until the 1833 Factory Act. Dickens thought that the English were `as hardworked as any people upon whom the sun shines'.<br /><br />He portrays vividly the urban working class culture of work, family, pubs, popular songs, music halls, football, fish and chips, elaborate funerals, good neighbours and street markets that became part of the dominant popular culture in the 1950s.<br /><br />Collins rejects the idea that the working class is backward and racist. \\"For decades, after all, the urban white working class has largely been educated in multiracial schools, worked in multiracial environments, and lived in multiracial neighbourhoods. Many may not have wanted this, and many more escaped it in the form of `white flight', but many more accepted it.\\"<br /><br />A 1997 Survey showed that only 13% of white Britons said they would have a problem if a relative married an Afro-Caribbean; 32% of Asians, 29% of Jews. So white Britons are the least racist, and the extent of interracial relationships proves the point.<br /><br />Employers don't employ immigrants out of compassion but because they're cheaper. Workers don't oppose mass immigration out of racism but because immigration cuts wages.<br /><br />Liberals and Trotskyists demonised those accused of the murder of Stephen Lawrence as `white trash', a racist phrase. Calling white boys racist or black boys muggers is the same hatred of workers.<br /><br />Playwright David Hare expressed the age-old snobs' caricature of the English when he said, \\"We associate `Englishness' with everything that is most backward in this country.\\" The working class supports the nation - flying the English flag and having pride in your country does not lead to the BNP.hat is most backward in this country.\\" The working class supports the nation - flying the English flag and having pride in your country does not lead to the BNP.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-04-06

So they urge the USA to cut its losses, withdraw from Iraq and respect its sovereignty and independence. \\"The United States must promptly end its military occupation of Iraq. A military withdrawal will maximize America's ability to refocus its efforts on the fight against Al Qaeda and other anti-American terrorist groups with global reach and, at the same time, minimize the risks to vital US national security interests.\\"<br /><br />\\"There is no economic imperative for keeping troops there. The American military presence is not essential, and might even be detrimental, to ensuring access to Persian Gulf oil. ... US policy in the Persian Gulf should not be based on the assumption that the region's energy resources will not make it to market absent the presence of US troops. Oil is the principal source of revenue for the Persian Gulf countries; they could not withhold it from world markets without committing economic suicide.\\"<br /><br />Bush and Blair told us that the occupation would pay for itself and that post-war Iraq would quickly settle into a stable peace. They now want US and British troops to occupy Iraq indefinitely, regardless of costs and risks.<br /><br />But \\"The military occupation of Iraq is counterproductive to winning the war on terrorism, enormously costly, militarily and economically unnecessary, and politically unsustainable. ... it emboldens anti-American terrorists to expand their operations, both against the forces in their neighbourhood and ultimately on American soil. And the presence of an American military garrison in Iraq weakens the forces of democratic reform by undermining an indigenous government's authority and credibility.\\"<br /><br /> \\"Iraq is many years away from becoming a stable unified democracy, and there is nothing that the United States can do to alter this state of affairs.\\" A democratic Middle East is a `chimera', so \\"U.S. military withdrawal should not be predicated on the establishment of a democratic government in Iraq.\\" No conditions should be set for withdrawal.Middle East is a `chimera', so \\"U.S. military withdrawal should not be predicated on the establishment of a democratic government in Iraq.\\" No conditions should be set for withdrawal. <br />	2005-04-05

Just 1,252 of them own 57% of Scotland. They pay no land tax. Instead every government gives them £2.3 billion a year and the EU gives them a further £2 billion. Each family gets £26,875.<br /><br />By contrast, 57.5 million of us pay £10 billion a year in council tax, a land tax, £550 per household. We live in 24 million homes on about four million acres. 65% of homes are privately owned, so 16 million of us own just 2.8 million acres, an average 0.18 acres each.<br /><br />The top landowners are the Forestry Commission, 2.6 million acres, the Ministry of Defence 750,000, the royal family 670,000 (including the Crown Estate 400,000 and the Duchy of Cornwall 141,000), the National Trust 550,000, insurance companies 500,000, the utility companies 500,000, the Duke of Buccleuch 270,700, the National Trust for Scotland 176,287, the Dukedom of Atholl 148,000, the Duke of Westminster 140,000 and the Church of England 135,000.<br /><br />The Forestry Commission, Britain's biggest single landowner, runs its holdings conservatively and secretively. We could expand the forest estate by a million acres a year, producing rural jobs, getting profits from the sale of wood and pulp (cutting our balance of payments deficit) and reducing the output of greenhouse gases. This would cost between £588 million and £750 million.<br /><br />Through the 18th century enclosures, the landowning class stole eight million acres from the people. They still hide their crimes and their takings. The 1872 Return of Owners of Land was made, but then hidden and never updated. Shares have to be registered; land doesn't. The Land Registry does not know who owns between 30 and 50% of land.<br /><br />Cahill compares Britain with other countries where revolutions have ended the feudal tenure of land. Denmark redistributed its land to the peasantry in 1800. In Ireland, in 1876, 616 landowners owned 80% of the country. By 1930, 13 million acres of Ireland's 20 million acres had been sold to owner-occupiers. Now, there are no landlords - home ownership is 82%, Ireland's 149,500 farms are 97% owner-occupied and owner-farmed, there is no poll tax, water is free and pensioners get free transport, TV and glasses.<br /><br />Cahill claims that Blair's reform of the House of Lords \\"definitively cut the permanent link between power and the landowners.\\" But just as in 1872, the state is defending landed capital by making it less visible. Class power does not depend on sitting in the House of Lords, but on private ownership of the means of production, protected and subsidised by a capitalist state. The Greens, like the heritage lobby, shield the landowners against public ownership of the land.<br /><br />The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs says its mission is to shift EU subsidies from food production to land management, but the EU already does this, with its £2 billion annual subsidy to the landowners, not to working farmers. We need to produce our own food: food production is in our national strategic interest. It is a national security issue that must not be determined either by the EU or by the market.<br /><br />Landowners' wealth is a parasite on Britain, the least productive part of the economy, with the most state support. Their wealth comes not from farming, nor even from renting, but from trickling land onto the urban housing market. They sell land to property developers, at an average price per acre of £404,000 in 1999. The clearing banks and building societies strip our industries of investment capital, then support their clients the landowners by running the rigged and overpriced land market.<br /><br />Britain needsland reform. \\"Windfall gains on development land should be made subject to windfall taxes.\\" We should also tax land and stop the owners avoiding tax through offshore trusts; this could raise £17 billion. The European Convention of Human Rights says there should be no confiscation without compensation. Haven't landowners had enough compensation already? We need more land for housing. This would cut land prices, free more to invest in good quality, spacious homes and gardens, and revive the building industry./>Britain needs land reform. \\"Windfall gains on development land should be made subject to windfall taxes.\\" We should also tax land and stop the owners avoiding tax through offshore trusts; this could raise 17 billion.

He shows how US protection for their drug-runner allies has led to the huge increase in drug trafficking in the last 50 years.<br /><br />The US strategy of opposing national self-determination involves alliances with drug-traffickers like the Sicilian Mafia, the Triads in South-East Asia, the Contras in Nicaragua, the Kosovo Liberation Army in Europe, the death squads in Colombia and the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan. As President Johnson's Secretary of State Dean Rusk said, the USA \\"should employ whatever means ... arms here, opium there.\\"<br /><br />From the 1870s to the 1960s, the British rulers of Malaya farmed the opium franchise to the Triads. The US state first copied this strategy in 1949, when it armed the defeated Kuomintang's drug networks in Burma and Laos, after the victorious Chinese revolution began to eliminate Chinese opium, then the source of 85% of the world's heroin.<br /><br />The US state encouraged its allies to enrich themselves through drugs, while it blamed the communist enemy for the evils that its allies were committing. From 1949 until at least 1964, the US told the UN Narcotics Commission that China was responsible for drug imports into the USA. In fact, the drugs were trafficked from Burma and Thailand, under the protection of the Kuomintang troops backed by the CIA. The Hong Kong authorities stated that they \\"were not aware of a traffic in narcotics from the mainland of China through Hong Kong\\" but \\"quantities of narcotics reached Hong Kong via Thailand.\\"<br /><br />The US state assaulted the whole region of South East Asia between 1950 and 1975, just as it is attacking the Middle East today. An earlier effort at regime change in Laos in 1959-60 was a disaster, putting drug traffickers in power. Opium production soared during the years of US intervention, the 1950s and 1960s, and plummeted in 1975 after the Vietnamese people kicked US forces out of the region.<br /><br />US military interventions lead to bigger drug flows into the USA. After the US intervention in Afghanistan in 1979, the Afghani-produced proportion of heroin consumed in the USA went from zero in 1979 to 52% in 1984.<br /><br />Later, the Taliban government cut opium production from 3,656 tons in 2000 (90% of Europe's heroin supply) to 74 tons in 2001 (US State Department figures), wiping out 70% of the world's illicit opium production. US forces, in alliance with a drug trafficking network, the Northern Alliance, defeated Al Qa'ida, another drug trafficking network. The US funded the Northern Alliance warlord and terrorist Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, making him the world's biggest heroin trafficker.<br /><br />Under US occupation, Afghan opium production has risen from 3,700 tons in 2002, to 3,400 tons in 2003, to 4,200 tons last year. The Financial Times wrote, \\"The U.S. and UN have ignored repeated calls by the international antidrugs community to address the increasing menace of Afghanistan's opium cultivation.\\" It is now the world's leading producer of illicit drugs, producing 90% of the heroin sold in Britain and Europe.

He shows how material forces, numbers and technology, only count if used in the modern system. Force deployment shapes the role of material forces. He analyses full data-sets of modern battles, proving that bigger is not always better.<br /><br />The increasing lethality of firepower means that since 1914 exposed mass movement is suicidal. Only the modern system of using combined arms, cover and concealment enables the attackers' forces to survive the defence's response.<br /><br />Biddle looks at three significant battles, firstly, the successful German attack of March 1918. For preponderance theorists, the Allies should have stopped this attack dead. The German/British force-to-force ratio was 1.5/1, among the least favourable of any major attack of the war. The British had a few more tanks, but the main weapons were still the infantry and guns of 1915-18, a defence-dominant technology. The British official history blamed the fog, as if there had been no fog until then.<br /><br />The Germans won an unprecedented breakthrough, advancing 40 miles across a 50-mile front. The Germans implemented the modern system tactically and to some extent operationally; the British didn't. This broke the great stalemate, not new technology, US intervention or exhaustion.<br /><br /> Biddle's second example, Operation Goodwood in July 1944, was the failed Allied effort to break out of the Normandy beachhead. The British had more troops and weapons: 1,277 tanks, 4,500 aircraft and 118,000 troops against 319 tanks, several hundred aircraft and 29,000 troops. If preponderance theorists were right, the British would have won, but they tried an exposed mass tank charge, unsupported by infantry or suppressive artillery.<br /><br /> Biddle's third example is Operation Desert Storm of 1991, which US forces won with an unprecedentedly low loss rate. US forces used the modern system, the Iraqis did not. The superior US air technology did not eliminate the Iraqi resistance: 2,000 tanks still fought back after the air assault. US troops with or without advanced ground technology, and those fighting local engagements at better or worse odds, won equally convincingly.he modern system, the Iraqis did not.

In particular, it tells how Blair pushed through the publication of the September 2002 dossier, `Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction: the assessment of the British government'.<br /><br />On 3 September 2002, Blair told us that Iraq was \\"a real and unique threat to the security of the region and the rest of the world.\\" He told Parliament that Iraq was `a real and present threat to Britain'. He wanted the dossier to back up these claims: the evidence had to be tailored to justify the verdict that he had already decided. But as `Mr A', a civil servant working in defence intelligence, e-mailed Dr Kelly, \\"You will recall [blanked out] admitted they were grasping at straws.\\"<br /><br />Blair's clinching argument was to be the sensational new claim that that Iraq was an imminent threat, that its \\"military planning allows for some of the WMD to be ready within 45 minutes of an order to use them.\\" This claim came only from a single, uncorroborated source, whose identity and report the government still refuses to divulge.<br /><br />The dossier repeated the claim four times, yet John Scarlett, Head of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), told the Hutton Inquiry that it was always known inside the government that the 45-minute claim referred only to battlefield weapons, not to weapons for missiles. So the government knew at the time that Iraq was no threat to anybody.<br /><br />The evidence produced at the Inquiry showed that Jonathan Powell, Downing Street's chief of staff, and Alastair Campbell, Downing Street's director of communications and strategy, both substantially altered the dossier: Campbell proposed fourteen changes that all strengthened the case for war. They also changed its title, at the last minute, from `Iraq's Programme of Weapons of Mass Destruction' to `Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction'.<br /><br />On 5 September, Campbell e-mailed Powell, \\"Re dossier, substantial rewrite with JS and Julian M in charge ... Structure as per TB's discussion.\\" Scarlett claimed `ownership' of the dossier, yet when Lord Hutton asked about his response to Campbell's proposed changes to the dossier, Scarlett replied, \\"Yes, I was accepting. And I see absolutely nothing difficult in that at all. It was entirely up to me how to respond. I was completely in control of this process. I felt it at the time and feel it subsequently.\\" Lord Hutton concluded, rather comically, the \\"PM's desire ... may have unconsciously influenced Mr Scarlett and the other members of the JIC.\\"<br /><br />A minute of a meeting held in Scarlett's office on 18 September showed the true picture: under the heading, `Ownership of the Dossier', it said simply, \\"Ownership lay with No. 10.\\" Campbell's remarks show how true this was. His diary entry of 5 September, on the dossier's contents, said, \\"It had to be revelatory: we needed to show it was new and informative and part of a bigger case.\\" On 17 September, he e-mailed Scarlett, \\"I think we should make more of the point about current concealment plans. Also in the executive summary, it would be stronger if we said that despite sanctions and the policy of containment, he has made real progress, even if this echoes the Prime Minister.\\" (My italics)<br /><br />Even after all this, Jonathan Powell advised, \\"We will need to make it clear in launching the document that we do not claim that we have evidence that he is an imminent threat.\\" But when Blair launched the dossier, he did override the intelligence and claim that Iraq was an imminent threat.<br /><br /> By the eve of war, in March 2003, all the government's claims about Iraq's WMD had been publicly proven false. The UN inspections had found no WMD in Iraq. In the 18 March debate on the war, no Minister repeated the 45-minute claim; at theSecurity Council, Colin Powell did not repeat it. But without the 45-minute claim, there was no threat; without the threat, there was no case for war. Yet Blair carried on regardless.<br /><br /> On 28 January 2004 (the day that Hutton delivered his Report), Dr David Kay, head of the US's Iraq Survey Group that had been seeking Iraq's WMD, told the Senate armed services committee, \\"I don't think they existed ... we were all wrong.\\" Blair and his team had abused the intelligence to try to justify an attack that he and Bush had agreed on when they met just a fortnight after the September 11 attack. Blair lied to us about the intelligence and he lied to us about the threat.<br /><br />The Bush/Blair attack on Iraq was an unnecessary and criminal aggression. It was a diversion from the real threat of fascist Islamic terrorists, and it has worsened that threat. As the JIC warned in February 2003, \\"al Qaeda and associated groups continued to represent by far the greatest threat to western interests, and the threat would be heightened by military action against Iraq.\\"<br /><br />Now Blair is trying to persuade us of the merits of another foreign venture, another commitment `for an unlimited period', by signing us up to the EU Constitution, whether we want to or not.

They criticise the post-war policies imposed by the US state. Even the UN Secretary-General decries `premature elections' and `cosmetic democracies'. Security in Afghanistan is now worse than for years. Opposition to the US/UN occupation is growing.<br /><br />The US-dominated World Bank insisted that all Afghanistan's pre-1979 debts be paid. The Bank says privatisation is the answer to government inefficiency and corruption, so they privatised the inefficiency and corruption! They even privatised the health service, despite the universal failures of health markets.<br /><br />Privatisation means governments spending our money to prop up private companies. Across the world, the evidence proves that privatisation grows private fortunes, not public services or economies, and that market liberalisation destroys societies and states.<br /><br />Nor is foreign aid the answer. In 2003, the US state allocated $1.6 billion for rebuilding Afghanistan, but most went to outside, mostly US, `consultants'. Only 10% resulted in finished projects. 83% of a $150 million Asian Development Bank loan for roads, power and gas went to foreign contractors. By 2002, 350 Non-Governmental Organisations, up from 46 in 1999, were competing for foreign aid funds.<br /><br />The authors rightly describe as `hopelessly idealistic' their own proposal that \\"the various international players [ugh!] have to leave their own agendas behind and start concentrating on Afghanistan.\\" The UN's failures in Kosovo, East Timor and now Afghanistan prove that the failures are systemic: UN intervention is part of the problem. The authors' contradictory ideal of `participatory intervention' mirrors Blair's imperial claim of `humanitarian intervention'.<br /><br />The authors are right to say, \\"Fundamentally it is not donor money that Afghanistan needs but a working economy.\\" But how? Not through the `new form of international engagement' that they suggest.<br /><br />The Afghan people need to get the foreign occupiers out so that they can freely decide their own future. But the authors, good little empire-building missionaries that they are, argue that withdrawal would be premature, always premature.

Eight economists ranked 38 proposals for spending $50 billion to address ten problems - climate change, communicable diseases, conflicts, access to education, financial instability, government corruption, hunger, migration, sanitation and clean water, and subsidies and trade barriers.<br /><br />The book proposes that these problems - many caused by globalisation, or imperialism as we call it - can only be solved by more globalisation. But are they really global problems, needing global solutions? Aren't these problems spread unevenly across the world's nations? Shouldn't every people make their own assessment of what they must do to improve their lives?<br /><br />The idea of ranking problems across the world ignores countries' different needs. Each country should decide how much to spend on what. It would be silly to put all their money into preventing diseases, and spend nothing on clean water.<br /><br />The economists supported public, not private, health services, \\"Health economists almost universally accept that market failures in health are so great that governments must intervene.\\" But they ranked trade liberalisation third and easier migration for skilled workers tenth. Don't free movements of capital and labour cause problems? As one of them, Jan Pronk, wrote, \\"Financial and monetary instabilities increase with globalisation, and economic inequality as well\\" and \\"Market reforms can lead to ... more rather than less poverty. ... in Africa and South Asia urban and rural poverty increased.\\"<br /><br />Some of the economists observed that capital controls shielded countries from shocks caused by capital movements. Some noted that migration of professional people from South to North robs developing countries of the fruits of their investment, and reduces wages, and increases profits, in the developed countries. Others believed that the more open the economy, the less unequal and corrupt it was, which would be news to Enron workers in the USA.<br /><br />The economists ranked at 16th, 17th and 18th proposals to address climate change - two forms of carbon tax, and implementing the Kyoto Pact. \\"The panel recognised that global warming must be addressed, but agreed that approaches based on too abrupt a shift towards lower emissions of carbon were needlessly expensive.\\"<br /><br />Finally, though, they did not recognise that some countries do the lot, without aid and without the advice of foreign economists. Cuba, for instance, controls diseases through its universal health services, prevents conflicts, educates all its people, has stable finances, curbs corruption, feeds its people, controls migration, ensures sanitation and clean water for all, and controls pollution. It supports its industries and controls capital and trade. Cuba disproves the book's assumption that capitalism is the best, indeed the only, choice for us all., which would be news to Enron workers in the USA.  <br /> <br />The economists ranked at 16th, 17th and 18th proposals to address climate change - two forms of carbon tax, and implementing the Kyoto Pact. \\"The panel recognised that global warming must be addressed, but agreed that approaches based on too abrupt a shift towards lower emissions of carbon were needlessly expensive.\\" <br /> <br />Finally, though, they did not recognise that some countries do the lot, without aid and without the advice of foreign economists.

Instead, Bush first attacked Afghanistan, overthrowing the Taliban government to impose his man Karzai, and missing bin Laden. He then attacked Iraq, the one Middle Eastern country with no Al Qa'ida. This is as if President Roosevelt had ignored Pearl Harbour and attacked India instead of Japan.<br /><br />CIA staff were told, \\"if Bush wants to go to war [against Iraq], it's your job to give him a reason to do so.\\" Similarly, Blair bullied the British intelligence services into giving him the lies he wanted. The same in Israel, in March 2004, an Israeli government inquiry found what the rest of us knew already, that warnings about Iraq's WMD were speculation not fact.<br /><br /> The leaders of the US, British and Israeli governments lied to their peoples, to the UN, to the world. For example, Vice-President Dick Cheney told the American people that there was `no doubt' that Saddam Hussein `has weapons of mass destruction'. He said, \\"We now know that Saddam has resumed his efforts to acquire nuclear weapons. ... Among other sources, we've gotten this from firsthand testimony from defectors, including Saddam's own son-in-law.\\" This was Hussein Kamel, who actually told US officials that Iraq had ended all uranium-enrichment programs in 1991 and never restarted them, and that \\"all weapons - biological, chemical, missile, nuclear - were destroyed\\" - the opposite of Cheney's claim.<br /><br />In 1996, US warmonger Richard Perle produced a plan for Israel to attack Iraq, Lebanon and Syria. The US government, with the British and Israeli states' support, has now carried out part one of this mad scheme of aggression. They see Iraq as a `launch point' for regime change across the Middle East.

John Gribbin covers the same ground, in 'Science - a history', and far more intelligently: in fact, large parts of Bryson's book read like copies of parts of Gribbin's book! Bryson's tome is not a 'short' history, and it is not of 'nearly everything'. He misses out loads of important science, and, as another reviewer has pointed out, he covers biographical trivia about scientists far better than he covers their scientific discoveries.<br /><br />Further, his main thesis feeds into the unpleasant current hysteria about various scares which are supposed to reduce us all to the status of cowering victims. Chapter after chapter just retail scare stories. If the asteroids aren't about to hit us, then it'll be global warming that gets us. If it's not global warming, it will be global cooling. All, as usual with the scaremongers (see the Independent this month and forever), without any assessment of the real likelihood of any of these events occurring, no evidence of their probability.

Most important is oil, which drives armed forces, economies and international politics.<br /><br />The US state treats oil as a matter of national security. Petroleum supplies 41% of its energy, two-thirds of it for transport (petrol fuels 97% of its transport). Since 1998, it has depended on foreign sources for over half its oil. But Europe, Russia, Japan and China also depend on foreign supplies, sharpening rivalry.<br /><br />The Middle East has two-thirds of the world's proven oil reserves: 25% in Saudi Arabia, 12.6% in Iran, 10.7% in Iraq, 9.3% in UAE, 9.3% in Kuwait and 1.5% in Qatar. All these countries' governments are now pro-US, except Iran. Russia and the Caspian Sea have 7.4%, the North Sea only 1.6%, Venezuela 7.4% and Nigeria 2.3%. There is also oil in Colombia, Mexico, Angola, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan.<br /><br />A US government report of 1941 urged, \\"more and more aggressive foreign policy aimed at assuring access to petroleum overseas.\\"  Earlier its cloak for aggression was `anti-communism', now it is `anti-terrorism'. The US state wants all the countries that it dominates to increase their oil exports to the USA.<br /><br />The capitalist road leads to more wars, permanent US occupation of the Middle East and rising terrorism. Before the attack on Iraq, Ahmed Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National Congress, promised, \\"American companies will have a big share of Iraqi oil.\\" US forces seized Iraq's oil fields, refineries and Oil Ministry. The US state is covertly allied to the Mujehadin-e Khalq, an anti-Iranian militia based in northern Iraq.<br /><br /> There is an alternative. Klare urges his country to end security agreements for US access to oil, particularly with the despots ruling Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States; to end all US military intervention in the Gulf, close all its bases in the Middle East and the Caspian region.

The Kashagan oil-field in the Caspian Sea has an estimated 60 billion barrels, compared to the North Sea's estimated 17 billion barrels. Oil companies and governments - the USA, Britain, France, Russia and China - struggle to control these resources and pipeline routes, making Central Asia a new battleground in the global oil war.<br /><br />For example, BP Amoco is investing $15 billion in Azerbaijan over the coming years. BP is the biggest organisation in Azerbaijan, owning a third of the shares in the Azerbaijan International Operating Company.<br /><br />Some scorn as conspiracy theory the idea that oil is behind so much of world politics. Kleveman quotes those well-known conspiracy theorists in the US Department of Energy, who reported in August 2001, \\"Afghanistan's significance from an energy standpoint stems from its geographical position as a potential transit route for oil and natural gas exports from central Asia to the Arabian Sea.\\"<br /><br />The US government has misused the war against terrorism as cover for its oil-driven aggressions against Afghanistan and Iraq (and Iran next?) The wars have nothing to do with terrorism or democracy or rebuilding.<br /><br />Their results are the proof - the complete failure to trap or kill the organisers of 9/11; the despotic US control of the Afghan and Iraqi governments, of Iraq's oilfields and Afghanistan's pipelines; the world's governments' promises to Afghanistan of $4.6 billion for rebuilding and their delivery of just $112 million.	2005-02-03

In this excellent book, the authors, a neuroscientist and a philosopher, answer the question.<br /><br />They say that Rene Descartes' ideas still cause many muddles. He thought that we were all ghosts in machines, two things in one. This was because he believed that there were two basic kinds of thing, mind and matter (a theory called dualism), and that what we are depends on what our minds do (idealism).<br /><br />The authors show that commonsense clears up the muddles. We are all living human beings. \\"The person  ... is a psychophysical entity, not a duality of two conjoined substances, a mind and a body.\\"<br /><br />The authors show that dualism - the ghost in the machine - can never explain how our minds relate to our bodies. Our minds are not things, so they cannot cause changes by acting on our brains.<br /><br />Often neuroscientists wrongly ascribe to our brains the activities that Descartes and his followers like John Locke ascribed to our minds. But human beings - not our brains or minds - think, see, decide and feel. \\"The brain and its activities make it possible for us - not for it - to perceive and think, to feel emotions, and to form and pursue projects.\\"<br /><br />Too many neuroscientists trap themselves in idealism. For example, Francis Crick wrote, \\"What we see appears to be located outside our body. ... What you see is not what is really there. ... In fact we have no direct knowledge of the objects in the world.\\"<br /><br />But the authors reply, \\"What we see does not appear to be located outside us. What we see is necessarily located outside our body, unless we are looking at ourselves in a mirror, or at our limbs or thorax.\\" We see what is really there, the real world, and we directly know objects in the world, which exist whether we see them or not.<br /><br />This is materialism, which \\"in its simplest and warranted form amounts to a denial that there are mental or spiritual substances.\\" Materialism does not mean that our minds are our brains. It does not mean that we explain things, even material things, by studying the matter of which they are made. Materialism does not reduce everything to physics, or reduce our minds to our nervous systems.<br /><br />Colin Blakemore was wrong to write, \\"We are machines\\", Crick wrong to write, \\"You ... are in fact no more than the behaviour of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules.\\" Our goals, motives and reasons - not our cells or molecules - explain our behaviour.<br /><br />The authors show that scientists and philosophers do two different, useful jobs. Scientists analyse what's true and what's false. They create theories to explain and hypotheses to predict.<br /><br />Philosophers analyse concepts and the rules for the use of words. They clarify what makes sense and what does not. And these authors have done this job superbly.or spiritual substances.\\" Materialism does not mean that our minds are our brains.

The rival empires' struggle for the Middle East's oil was one of the causes of the First World War. Control of this resource was one of World War Two's great prizes.<br /><br />The oil price rises of the 1970s made the North Sea and Alaska fields profitable and led to the petrodollar monetary system, based on speculation not investment, profit not production.<br /><br />Oil money has always funded the environmental and anti-nuclear movements.

This outstanding book shows how this failure has distorted the Times' news and views and led to regular acceptance of the US state's deceptions.<br /><br />The authors show how the Times has consistently echoed the US government. For example, it ignored the 1954 Geneva peace accords, reported as fact President Johnson's lies about Vietnamese aggression in the Tonkin Gulf in 1964, backed the illegal US interference in Nicaragua, misreported the 1986 World Court's condemnation of this interference, and denied the US role in the coup attempts against Venezuela's elected President.<br /><br />Recently, the Times endorsed the illegal Bush/Blair aggression against Iraq, a violation of the UN Charter, which prohibits the use of force. In its 70 editorials on Iraq between 11 September 2001 and 21 March 2003, it never mentioned the UN Charter or international law.<br /><br />The Times presented Iraqi possession of WMD as fact, ignoring the IAEA's 60 reports showing it had destroyed Iraq's nuclear programme. The Times also ignored the UNMOVIC and IAEA reports that they had inspected eight of the nine suspected WMD sites listed in Blair's September 2002 dossier, and found no evidence of WMD. The Times failed to note that possession of WMD, even if proven, is not a casus belli.<br /><br />The illegal invasion of Iraq led inevitably to all the other illegalities, the illegal occupation, the killing of more than 100,000 civilians, the illegal detention of 40,000 Iraqis, the systematic abuse and atrocities, the destruction of 70% of Fallujah's homes.<br /><br /> The authors point out that torture thrives where detainees are illegally held in secret without charge or trial, that is, kidnapped. This crime by the US and British leaders led inevitably to breaches of the US Constitution, which forbids cruel and unusual punishment, and of the Geneva Conventions and the 1984 Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.  <br />	2005-01-28

It is now three and a half years since Bush promised to get `the people who knocked these buildings down'. Instead, he attacked the one Middle Eastern country where there was no Al Qa'ida.<br /><br />What does the occupation mean? 40,000 prisoners, torture, atrocities, beatings, humiliation, intimidation, killings, death squads, house searches, raids, demolitions. No jobs, no water, no electricity, no rebuilding, no security. Power plants, telephone exchanges, sewage and sanitation systems all still in ruins.<br /><br />The US government pledged $18.4 billion for rebuilding Iraq, but any money goes straight through to firms like Halliburton, which gets $1 billion of taxpayers' money every month, saving it from bankruptcy. (Cheney had bought Dresser Industries for $7.7 billion, without noticing that it owed billions in damages.)<br /><br />Bechtel got the $1.8 billion contract to rebuild Iraq's water, sewage and electricity systems. Both Halliburton and Bechtel have been fined for corrupt practice. Another US firm got a $780 million contract, despite convictions for fraud on three federal projects and a total ban on receiving US government work.<br /><br />The coalition gets ever smaller, the insurgency ever larger: the longer the occupiers stay, the more insurgents there seem to be.<br /><br />Rumsfeld, while publicly promising a swift victory, said in a private memo that the USA is in for a `long, hard slog' in Iraq and Afghanistan. Cheney said in April 1991, \\"I think to have American military forces engaged in a civil war inside Iraq would fit the definition of quagmire, and we have absolutely no desire to get bogged down in that fashion.\\"<br /><br />It's an old story. T. E. Lawrence wrote in August 1920, \\"The people of England have been led in Mesopotamia into a trap from which it will be hard to escape with dignity and honour. They have been tricked into it by a steady withholding of information. The Baghdad communiqu&eacute;s are belated, insincere, incomplete.

This book, a serious, detailed defence of our freedoms, is a worthy successor to his 1999 book, The Abolition of Britain, a passionate defence of Britain's integrity and sovereignty against the EU.<br /><br />Most EU members lack habeas corpus, the presumption of innocence, single jeopardy, the right to silence and trial by jury. Now the EU wants to impose on us the European legal system (corpus juris), its mode of policing and its own prosecution service. Europol can already operate here, its officers immune from prosecution. Under the European arrest warrant, prosecuting authorities from any EU member country can order the arrest of a citizen of any other EU country. The Crown Prosecution Service is eliding into an EU prosecution service, an unaccountable servant of the state.<br /><br />Hitchens makes an excellent case against ID cards, which would be compulsory and costly. He notes that the Australians and New Zealanders both defeated the proposal.<br /><br />He points out that previous British governments wrongly copied US police methods unsuited to `this wholly different country'. He notes, \\"The Victorian network of police stations has been lopped as drastically as were the railways by the half-witted Beeching cuts of the sixties.\\" Thatcher closed a thousand police stations, one in three, between 1992 and 2002, and centralised the police force. The public want bobbies on the beat: we want laws enforced, not more laws and rights. Macpherson aimed to institutionalise racism, demanding, \\"`Colour-blind' policing must be outlawed.\\"<br /><br />Hitchens urges that we build new mental hospitals, ending the `shameful Care in the Community programme' and getting the mentally ill out of prisons. He argues persuasively against decriminalising drugs.<br /><br />This government overrules the rule of law, suspends habeas corpus and defends those who close down theatres. Its acts, particularly the Racism and Xenophobia Directive and a new offence of `religiously aggravated threatening behaviour', threaten our freedom of thought and speech: behaviour is either threatening or it isn't - the law should deal with actions, not with thoughts.<br /><br />All these attacks on our freedoms are allowed, if not obligatory, under the EU Constitution.hobia Directive and a new offence of `religiously aggravated threatening behaviour', threaten our freedom of thought and speech: behaviour is either threatening or it isn't - the law should deal with actions, not with thoughts. <br /> <br />All these attacks on our freedoms are allowed, if not obligatory, under the EU Constitution. <br /> <br />	2005-01-13

Under the UN Charter, aggressive war is the supreme crime. So colonial conquests - stealing nations' rights to self-determination - are criminal.<br /><br />Most of the essays are about colonial conquests, for example, the German destruction of the Herero in 1904-08, France's assault on Algeria 1954-62 and the USA's attack on Vietnam in 1963-75, killing three million people. But there is no mention of the crimes committed abroad by the British ruling class, the slave trade, the recurrent famines in British India, its endless colonial wars, nor of the US-British attacks on China and King Leopold's pillage of the Congo in the 19th century, Japan's assault on China in the 1930s, the USA's attacks on Korea in 1950-53, killing two million civilians, or apartheid South Africa's wars against its neighbours.<br /><br />The editor includes Eric Langenbacher's misguided essay describing the Allied bombing of Nazi Germany as genocide. Yet it cut Germany's industrial production in 1944-45 by a fifth. Albert Speer, Hitler's minister for munitions, called the bombing the `cause of all our setbacks'. It was a legitimate contribution to the just war against Nazism.<br /><br />The US and British states backed the slaughters in Guatemala from 1954, in Indonesia in 1965 (a million killed), Chile in 1973, Somalia in 1988, Rwanda in the 1990s, the sanctions against Iraq in the 1990s (killing an estimated 1.5 million people), Colombia now.<br /><br />In the 1991 US-British attack on Iraq, US forces used 940,000 DU shells and 62,000 cluster bombs, all illegal under the Geneva Conventions. The US-British attack on Yugoslavia in 1999 included attacks on civilians and the use of 31,000 DU rounds and 1,400 cluster bombs. The attack was illegal under the UN Charter and the US Constitution. The recent US-British attacks on Iraq and Afghanistan have killed respectively at least 100,000 and 3,600 civilians.<br /><br />As Marx wrote, capitalism was born in `plundering, piracy, kidnapping slaves, and colonial conquest'.

He shows how Labour backed the US aggression against Vietnam, tore up the Geneva Agreement, supported every escalation, opposed every effort at negotiation, used the SAS and MI6, gave military training and sold arms.<br /><br />Now Labour backs Nepal's king, who has dismissed the elected government and postponed elections indefinitely. It aids and trains his forces, which have a far worse human rights record than the resistance.<br /><br />Labour backs the Obasanjo tyranny in Nigeria, which has killed at least 2,200 people (far more killed than in Zimbabwe, for instance), but Nigeria has yielded $300 billion worth of oil over the last few decades.<br /><br />Labour backs the Colombian government, a drug-dealing tyranny which has killed tens of thousands pretending that it is warring on drugs. British firms are the country's largest investors, at $10 billion. BP has invested $2 billion and controls half Colombia's oil output.<br /><br />Labour backs Sharon's plan for permanently occupying the West Bank, which tears up all the UN Resolutions requiring Israel to withdraw from the illegally occupied territories. Labour doubled its arms exports to Israel in 2001-02 - machine guns, rifles, tear gas, leg irons, electric shock belts, and parts for tanks, helicopters and F-16 planes. It abstained in the UN vote declaring Israel's wall illegal.<br /><br />Curtis proves with a wealth of examples that the key features of the current war on Iraq are endemic and typical of Britain's ruling class: \\"in particular: the violation of international law, the government's abuse of the UN, its deception of the public and its support for US aggression.\\" Only the incompetence of this government is unusual: their lies were so bad that we rumbled them.<br /><br />As the House of Commons Defence Committee reported approvingly in March 2004, the Ministry of Defence's \\"media strategy ... was an integral part of the overall military plan.\\" The Foreign Office's London-based `public diplomacy' cost £340 million a year.

She describes the US state's no-bid contracts for Iraq's wealth, in which Bechtel won $1 billion worth of work and Dick Cheney's Halliburton won $1.2 billion worth. Rupert Murdoch said of the war, \\"The greatest thing to come of this to the world economy, if you could put it that way, would be $US20 a barrel for oil.\\"<br /><br />Goodman describes embedded journalism as the war version of reality TV. The Ministry of Defence and the US Defense Department's Office of Strategic Influence both run high-intensity domestic `psyops' (psychological operations). US Army psyops officers even work in CNN and NPR news offices.<br /><br />On 8 April 2003, US forces attacked the Baghdad offices of Abu Dhabi Television, Al Jazeera and Reuters, killing three journalists and wounding four. CNN commentator General Wesley Clark said, \\"It's a case of a very unfortunate accident of war. People were in the wrong place at the wrong time ... The United States wouldn't deliberately kill journalists.\\" Three separate accidents? Three separate wrong places - their offices? And, yes, they would deliberately kill journalists: the Pentagon spokeswoman later told journalists, \\"You should not be there.\\"<br /><br /> As Goodman observes, it's never the right time to oppose a war. Not before the war, because there's not going to be war since `our' government is sincerely negotiating to prevent war, so it is unnecessary and premature to talk of opposing the war. Not during the war, because that's disloyal, stabbing our boys in the back.

Blum reports that the anti-Vietnam war movement was not pacifist in general terms but specifically opposed the US attack on Vietnam.<br /><br />Blum saw that time and again the US state intervened abroad not to back democracy but to smash it: the war against Vietnam was not an aberration, but it was typical and endemic to the capitalist system. How can anyone believe that the January elections in Iraq are about empowering the Iraqi people?<br /><br />The anti-Vietnam war movement soon learned that \\"it was ridiculous to appeal to the President as if were some unaware innocent bystander who needed only to be `enlightened' before he would see the error of his ways.\\" They saw how the CIA infiltrated the trade unions and the anti-war movement, and Blum notes that Blair's friend Bill Clinton snitched to the CIA about the anti-war protestors he joined in Britain.<br /><br />Blum was in Chile from August 1972 to May 1973. In March 1973 the left gained 7% more votes in the congressional elections. So the ruling class, aided by the US state, decided that they could only get rid of Allende through a coup, which they duly carried out on 11 September.<br /><br />Based on vast amounts of evidence, from official documents, rulers' memoirs, and investigative reporting, Blum's books are probably the best introduction to the US state's real role in the world.

Scheuer was the CIA officer who led the hunt for Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Scheuer argues that Al Qa'ida opposes the US state because of its policies and actions in and against the Muslim world, not because of its values or ideas. So he urges `dramatic foreign policy change' and `stronger military actions'.<br /><br />On foreign policy, he notes that pro-Israeli, pro-Saudi policies endanger US national interests. \\"Status quo U.S. policy toward Israel will result in unending war with Islam.\\" It \\"drains resources, earns Muslim hatred, and serves no vital U.S. national interest.\\" He urges abandoning `the sordid legacy of Woodrow Wilson's internationalism' and the `ill-advised and hallucinatory crusade for democracy'. He describes Bush and Blair as `the ass end of imperialism'. He demands energy self-sufficiency to end dependence on Persian Gulf regimes.<br /><br />On the necessary military measures, he points out that in September 1996 bin Laden declared war on the USA, yet neither Clinton nor Bush ever prepared a counter-attack. 9/11, an act of war, not of terror, needed a swift military response, yet next day Defense Secretary Rumsfeld feebly requested `credible military options'. Scheuer writes that US leaders \\"delayed action, downplayed intelligence, ignored repeated warnings, and generally behaved as what they so manifestly are, America's greatest generation - of moral cowards.\\"<br /><br />The US state faces a growing worldwide anti-US insurgency, which it needs to defeat by war. As the military historian John Keegan wrote before the Bush/Blair attack on Afghanistan, \\"America should not seek to change the regime, but simply to find and kill terrorists.\\" Instead, in both Afghanistan and Iraq, they changed the regime, missed the terrorists and let the terrorists regroup and recruit.<br /><br />In May 2003, Rumsfeld declared victory in Afghanistan, as Bush did in Iraq.

Ratner was co-counsel in Rasul v Bush, which the New York Times called \\"the most important civil rights case in half a century\\" because on 28 June 2004 the Supreme Court ruled against President Bush that the US military could not hold what it called `enemy combatants' indefinitely, without charge and without access to legal representation. The Court ruled that the prisoners had the right to challenge their detentions in civilian courts.<br /><br />The Bush government then set up `combatant status review tribunals', supposedly to decide whether the detainees had been correctly designated as enemy combatants and therefore were being rightfully detained according to the laws of combat. However, the administration breached the Supreme Court's ruling that the prisoners had the right to challenge their detentions in civilian courts, since all the tribunals' members are military officers.<br /><br />Guantanamo is `an interrogation camp', which is flatly illegal, under US and international law. It harks back to Stuart Britain's offshore penal colonies which were beyond the reach of law, forms of executive imprisonment which the 1679 Habeas Corpus Act made illegal. The US detention centres in Iraq, Afghanistan and Diego Garcia and on board US aircraft carriers are modern Devil's Islands.<br /><br />The International Committee of the Red Cross has reported that US forces had inflicted on the 550 prisoners illegally held at Guantanamo Bay psychological and physical coercion that was `tantamount to torture'. It said, \\"the construction of such a system, whose stated purpose is the production of intelligence, cannot be considered other than an intentional system of cruel, unusual and degrading treatment and a form of torture.\\" At least three children, between 11 and 13, were held at Guantanamo; some are still there today.<br /><br />The British state is guilty of collaboration and connivance with these illegal US state actions.

He provided AIDS drugs at the taxpayer's expense, so the drug companies did not have to cut their inflated, monopoly prices.<br /><br />In 1998, US companies avoided $54 billion in taxes through using offshore tax havens, mostly British-run. The accounting firm Ernst & Young told its clients to use these havens: \\"the improvement on earnings is powerful enough that maybe the patriotism issue needs to take a back seat.\\" To capitalism, profits are the be-all and end-all, patriotism is just one issue among many.<br /><br />Huberman details the warmongering against Iraq, Iran, North Korea and Cuba. Vice-President Cheney once said, \\"You've got to go where the oil is\\", which rather sums up US foreign policy.<br /><br />Bush and Blair's war against terrorism would be a permanent war, with a permanent police state. The US state is destroying the American people's rights; witness the police violence against anti-war demonstrators in every part of the country.<br /><br />Blair helped Bush to win in November by sending British troops where Bush wanted and by ordering Ministers never to criticise the Bush government. The whole Labour Party was in effect part of Bush's election committee. The Republicans played the terror and scare cards, claiming that only they were sound on security. Labour is now playing the same dirty trick.. Labour is now playing the same dirty trick. <br />	2004-12-02

Nuclear Ambitions and the American Response	Books	1	9	13	N	N	Attempted justification for attacking Iran	Howard, a British journalist who covered the attack on Afghanistan for the Daily Mail, has written a book promoting a US attack on Iran.<br /><br />The US state continually threatens to attack Iran, demanding regime change. Its Iran Democracy Act of 2003 funds opposition groups in Iran, breaking its 1981 agreement not to interfere in Iran's affairs. It backs the blacklisted mujehadin terrorist MKO's efforts to overthrow the Iranian government.<br /><br />The US state claims that Iran is no democracy. Yet Iran is far more democratic than we are told. It directly elects its President and its city, town and village governments. In 2002 the UN Human Rights Commission voted to remove Iran from its blacklist of countries. Iran's press is freer than most. Women have more rights - 63% of 2002's university intake was female. Schoolgirls no longer have to wear headscarves and robes in school.<br /><br />Yet Howard parrots the US state's efforts to justify attacking Iran because it might develop a nuclear bomb. He claims there are `good reasons to fear the development of an Iranian nuclear bomb'. Why? Because this would `enhance their security'. Hasn't Iran any right to security? Iran's possession of a bomb would \\"encourage militants in the region to adopt a yet more aggressive approach against the Israeli Defence Force.\\" So it's not the IDF that's aggressive but its victims!<br /><br />Howard asserts, quoting Bush, that the USA \\"has some reason to fear that the regime would transfer warheads into the hands of terrorist networks\\" and \\"An Iranian bomb would also be at risk of inadvertently falling into the hands of third parties.\\" This is no more likely than Saddam Hussein letting his enemy bin Laden get the WMD that Saddam didn't have anyway!<br /><br />In his last two chapters, Howard discusses the \\"different ways in which Washington could try to engineer political change inside Iran.\\" He calls for `a far-reaching programme of free-market reforms', privatisation, labour market `flexibility', and ending foreign exchange controls. Is he after a job with Bush?<br /><br />The Iranian people have every right to determine their own future, without fear of attack.

Why then do US interventions abroad produce bad results?<br /><br />The authors explore ten themes: the promotion of fear - `be afraid, be very afraid'; escape (emigration, running away); exceptionalism - believing themselves different from and better than other nations, there is no need to know anything about them; the USA as the idea of nation is everybody's future; everything should be democratically accessible - guns, other people's oil, etc.; the right to be imperial; cinema as empire's engine (not profit then?!); worldwide celebrity as empire's currency; war as needed for origin, identity, consolidation, expansion and hegemony; and the USA's way as universal.<br /><br />The authors explore how Hollywood has given America its idealised image of itself. John Ford's classic Western Drums along the Mohawk (1939) explored the themes of civilising the wilderness by pushing back the frontier, building a new life and a new land by wiping out Native Americans.<br /><br />Frank Capra's Mr Smith goes to Washington (also 1939) presented the USA as the idea of nation, sanctifying the US Constitution, an 18th century document which endorses `the right of property in a slave', does not guarantee the right to vote and does not allow a direct vote for the head of government.<br /><br />Howard Hawks' To have and have not (1944), like Casablanca (1942), gave us Humphrey Bogart as the reluctant hero, symbolising the USA as reluctant superpower. Robert Altman's The player (1992) examined Hollywood, empire and celebrity. Sands of Iwo Jima (1949), starring John Wayne, presented war's psychosis. Universal soldier (1992) portrayed the USA as the global narrative.<br /><br /> The authors impute a single culture to the USA, ignoring its working class culture of trade unions, workers' nationalism and opposition to empire. Like the hero of Groundhog Day (1993), the USA is trapped in repeats, of exploitation and war.

Books	4	9	10	N	N	Good account of an unnecessary, diversionary war	Historian and journalist Dilip Hiro has written a detailed account of the continuing Bush/Blair attack on Iraq. He examines the preparations for the invasion, the attack itself and the continuing war since Bush declared victory in May 2003. Hiro shows how the attack on Iraq has diverted us from defeating Al Qa'ida, and how it has increased the terrorist threat.<br /><br />He details the Bush and Blair governments' systematic lies to the UN, to Parliament and Congress, to the British and American peoples, and to the Hutton and other inquiries. Almost everything that we are told about the war comes from `embedded' reporters, who are required by contract to agree to obey Bush's instructions.<br /><br />The occupation is causing chaos - 60% unemployment, worsening health and education, an estimated 100,000 killed, shortages of water, fuel and electricity, and minimal rebuilding. The occupying forces are not seeking, and will never achieve, a friendly, stable or democratic Iraq.<br /><br />The US and British forces are using cluster bombs, heavy artillery and napalm, real weapons of mass destruction, just like in Vietnam. So, as in Vietnam, they are losing hearts and minds, and losing the war.<br /><br />The January election will not improve security or `change the atmosphere', as Blair claims. Their aim is not election but dereliction. In years to come, if we let it happen, they will sigh, `to save Iraq we had to destroy it'.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, the occupation is generating popular hatred of the occupier, fuelling the national resistance. The vast majority of the Iraqi people want the occupying forces out as soon as possible, as do the majority of the British and American peoples.<br /><br />But Blair says that the troops will stay to oversee the 30 January election, then that they will stay till December 2005. The US commanders say that they will leave in 2006, if the security situation allows. Chief of the General Staff Sir Michael Walker says that British troops will stay indefinitely, `depending on the security threat to the Iraqi authorities'.

Blair has organised a record five wars in six years - `Desert Fox' against Iraq, and invasions of Serbia, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan and Iraq.<br /><br /> We can't say we weren't warned. Blair said in April 1997, \\"Century upon century it has been the destiny of Britain to lead other nations. That should not be a destiny that is part of our history. It should be part of our future. We are a leader of nations or nothing.\\" In the same speech, he was to have said, \\"I am proud of the British Empire\\", but one of his spinners told him to omit this! Didn't the Empire's rulers always claim to be taking over for the sake of the benighted natives?<br /><br />Blair has, over and again, backed the US state, which has consistently schemed to control the Middle East and its oil. All during the 1980s, Reagan and Thatcher sold chemical and other weapons to [...], to sustain his attack on Iran. Thatcher even signed a £340 million export credit guarantee for Iraq a month after the chemical attack on Halabja, in March 1988.<br /><br /> After that war, the US no longer wanted proxies in the Middle East: it wanted direct control. As the Project for the New American Century proclaimed in September 2000, \\"the need for a substantial American presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of [...].\\" So the real reason for war was never the nature of the Iraqi regime, never the need for democracy. Bush does not want free elections in Iraq, he wants a government that will accept US occupation and control. In free elections, the Iraqi people would reject such a government.<br /><br />Nor was a supposed threat from Iraq the real reason for war. Blair misled the nation when, in his TV address to the nation on 20 March, he said, \\"My judgement as Prime Minister is that this threat is real, growing and of an entirely different nature to any conventional threat to our security that Britain has faced before.\\"<br /><br />But all these unnecessary were not just `Blair's wars': they were social democracy's wars too, because the Labour Party endorsed them all. And they are not the end of the matter: Vice President Dick Cheney has said that sixty regimes in the world needed changing. What would Blair do if Bush decided to change Cuba's regime? What would the Labour party do?  More important, what would we all do?<br /><br />Even two million marchers did not stop a war.

They warned against relying on oil and gas from unstable regions like southern Russia, the Middle East and North and West Africa. Powergen confirmed how right the unions are when it recently told us, \\"From 29 November 2004 your electricity prices will rise by around 44p a week. Why the price increase? There are many reasons, for example: producing energy is now more expensive, so the wholesale price of energy has risen for all suppliers. The UK's gas supply is also declining so we must now spend more importing gas from around the world.\\"<br /><br />The unions warned that EU directives would add to our energy problems, particularly the carbon emissions trading directive which would curtail the lifetime of existing power stations. The unions believe it is vital that the nation invests in clean coal fired power stations and in power engineering and manufacturing industries to develop expertise in designing and building new power stations.<br /><br />In 2003 nuclear power stations provided 23% of Britain's electricity. By 2010, a third of these will have reached the end of their operating lives and will be closed, and nuclear power will account for just 16% of our electricity supply. Only two new stations are under construction. The closures will reduce Britain's ability to generate our own dependable energy supply. We need to plan and build more new nuclear power stations. France's nuclear plants produce three quarters of the country's power, one of the cheapest energy supplies in Europe.<br /><br />We need to reduce energy waste, estimated to cost £5 billion a year, and rationally use our resources.

For a fraction of their market value, the capitalists offered to look after the shares that the government put up as collateral for the loans, `managing' the state's stake in the energy companies in exchange for loans to the deficit-ridden state. This allowed them to claim that the nation's assets were not being sold off. In these corrupt insider deals, the Yeltsin government let the new capitalists take the companies from their directors, buying Yeltsin their support against the communists. The government could not repay the loans. The capitalists then sold the shares to themselves very cheaply, as repayment for the loans, through offshore companies.<br /><br />The government used companies' book values as fixed in January 1992, before the great inflation, as the basis for the voucher auctions. Yeltsin's Deputy Prime Minister, Yegor Gaidar, freed prices in January 1992, causing 2500% inflation, wiping out workers' life savings, 70 million accounts in the state-owned Sberbank alone.<br /><br />In November-December 1995, the government auctioned 12 of Russia's biggest companies. A tiny handful of banks ran the auctions, disqualified their rivals, excluded foreigners, bid in the auctions and won the bids. The capitalists admitted that they paid 40 times less than the enterprises were worth. In a closed auction run by his own bank, Uneksimbank, Vladimir Potanin (the deputy prime minister in charge of finance) bought, for just $170.1 million, Norilsk Nickel, the world's biggest producer of nickel and platinum, whose profits that year were $1.2 billion. The bank disqualified a rival bid of $350 million on a technicality. Potanin also bought oil companies at non-competitive prices and then sold the products at below market prices to trading companies he owned. He sold Gazprom, the natural gas monopoly, for $228 million, a thousandth of its value. Potanin sold 51% of the Sidanco oil company, for which he loaned the government $130 million. Then he bought the company for $130 million in the auction: in 1997, BP paid $571 million for just a 10% stake.

But he actually gives us a picture of greedy criminals.<br /><br />Russia's privatisation programme was huge, rapid and unprecedented. By 1996, 18,000 industrial enterprises, 80% of the total, employing 80% of Russia's industrial workers, producing 90% of Russia's industrial output, had been privatised.<br /><br />Russia's 1992 Privatisation Programme, which the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs fought for, allowed directors and workers to buy 51% of the voting shares in their organisation, at a nominal price, using the enterprise's own funds. All were given vouchers, which could buy shares.<br /><br />All too often, workers agreed not to interfere with the management, in exchange for promises of job security. Often, managers bought workers' shares before they had any market value, or outbid the workers, in collaboration with banks. In some cases, President Boris Yeltsin issued special decrees, excluding outsiders.<br /><br />  Factory managers used cooperatives, joint ventures and later, shell companies and offshore havens to leach cash and raw materials out of public enterprises. They created banks and trading companies that seized the factory's output and put the profits into their offshore accounts. Law and order were shredded.<br /><br />These management buyouts led to short termism, parasitic profits (not productive investment, not rebuilding), asset stripping and capital flight (totalling possibly $150 billion between 1991 and 1999). Russia's wealth, produced by its workers, went into thousands of offshore bank accounts, real estate holdings and offshore companies.<br /><br />For example, in 1993 Boris Berezovsky, Yeltsin's friend, bought 35,000 Ladas at low export prices from the producer Avtovaz, Russia's largest car factory, paying 10% down, the rest to be paid 30 months later in a time of huge inflation, nearly bankrupting the producer. He then sold them to Russians at high market prices, making $3000 a car, in a $105 million deal. Later, Berezovsky bought a third of the company for just $3 million, in a one-bidder auction. Berezovsky loaned the government $100 million for 51% of Sibneft, Russia's sixth biggest oil company, in 1995, and sold it to himself 18 months later for $110 million.<br /><br />Anatoly Chubais, head of the State Privatization Committee, said of Russia's capitalists, \\"They steal and steal and steal. They are stealing absolutely everything and it is impossible to stop them.\\" By 2002, five capitalists controlled 95% of Russia's aluminium, 18% of her oil, 40% of her copper, 20% of her steel and 20% of car production.

The author clearly intends us to appreciate the characters she portrays as dynamic and progressive entrepreneurs. But she actually gives us a picture of a bunch of greedy criminals who have shamelessly looted and wrecked their country.<br /><br />The government sold off several huge oil companies including LUKoil, Russia's largest company, Yukos, Russia's second biggest oil company, and Sidanco. Mikhail Khodorovsky loaned the government $159 million for a 45% stake in Yukos in 1995. He sold it to himself in 1996, using a shell company, for $160 million. The state got $1 million profit; Khodorovsky got the company, valued at $15 billion in 2002. He bought oil cheap from the extractor companies, and pledged it, at high export prices, to secure the loans. This transfer pricing stripped the assets and values from the producers, who got only the debts and expenses. Goldman Sachs profited from the looting: they underwrote Khodorovsky's $500 million loan against future oil sales.<br /><br />In 2000, Sibneft bought 27% of its shares for $542 million from shareholders. Less than a year later it secretly sold those shares, for far less, back to the same shareholders. It then announced a $612 million dividend to the stockholders - one of whom, Roman Abramovich, now the owner of Chelsea Football Club, owned 87% of the stock. He had stripped Sibneft's cash to fund his repurchase.<br /><br />The government sold off other national assets at knock-down prices, including tax concessions, TV channels, radio frequency licences, export licences and government bank accounts. Yeltsin privatised Channel 1, which reached 200 million Russians, without the legally required auction, selling it to his ally Berezovsky, whose capital was only $2.2 million. The government sold bonds to the capitalists' banks at a huge discount. The banks resold the bonds at market prices, raising cash supposedly for Yeltsin's re-election campaign, but the owners pocketed most of it.<br /><br />The capitalists looted state funds and the Soviet Union's gold reserves. The new banks took billions of dollars of party, government and trade union funds, and transferred the money to foreign bank accounts.

The debt has become a self-perpetuating vicious circle where new debts are taken out to pay off the interest on standing ones.\\"<br /><br />The authors quote the Russian legal theorist Alexander Nahum Sack who wrote, \\"If a despotic power contracts a debt, not according to the needs and interests of the State, but to fortify the despotic regime, to put down the population which would combat it, this debt is odious for the population of the entire State. This debt is not binding for the nation, it is the debt of a regime, the personal debt of the power which contracted it. Consequently, it falls when that power falls.\\"<br /><br />So in 1776, the new revolutionary state of the USA repudiated all the debts due to bankers in London. Similarly, in 1917 the Bolshevik government repudiated the Tsar's debts to British and French banks.<br /><br />The authors cite a Touareg proverb, \\"What you do for the others without the others, is against the others.\\" This hits the capitalist globalisers, and also the anarchists whose federal networks of committee and forums mirror their false internationalism.<br /><br />The workers in the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America do not need international committees or social forums to tell them what to do.

In El Salvador in 1980-91, 75,000 people were killed, of whom the government, its army, the National Guard and its death squads, killed 95%. The US gave El Salvador's state $6 billion, supporting the terror.<br /><br />In Guatemala in 1962-96, the state's forces killed more than 90% of the 200,000 people killed. In Chile after the coup of 11 September 1973, the state, again, killed more than 95% of those killed. In Argentina in 1976-83, 8,960 were killed. In Colombia in 1986-95, 45,000 were killed, again 95% by the army and death squads.<br /><br />Between 1980 and 1988 the South African state killed 1.5 million people in neighbouring countries. Indonesia's army killed at least 1.5 million people in 1965, 1975 and 1999: the US state supported elections on the back of these massacres.<br /><br />In every case, the US state backed the state terrorism before, during and after it was committed. Gareau cites three studies proving that the more a state violated its citizens' rights, the more US aid it received.<br /><br />This was state terrorism, not even-handed civil wars with half the violence committed by one side and half by the other. It was counter-revolutionary murder by US-equipped, US-trained armed forces against people with hardly any means of self-defence.<br /><br />Why this one-sided ferocity? US military training teaches recruits to use pre-emptive terrorism - `do it to them before they do it to us'. It tells recruits that the enemy will torture and kill them, take no prisoners and show no respect for the laws of war.<br /><br />Gareau sums up, \\"Washington has the right, indeed the duty, to defend the United States against terrorism. The question arises as to how it should do this.  ... the way the Bush administration has chosen ... is immoral, illegal, overly belligerent, and in many ways counterproductive.\\"<br /><br />This account of US interventions shows that its brutal and lawless occupation of Iraq is no aberration.

He has written a very useful book on Cuba's long struggle for national independence and sovereignty. The first third of the book examines the Cuban people's struggle against Spanish occupation from the 16th to the 19th centuries. The rest of the book looks at Cuba's 20th century struggle against the US empire.<br /><br />The USA intervened militarily in Cuba in 1906-09, 1912, 1917-23 and 1961, always on the pretexts of establishing democracy and order. In 1902 the US state imposed the Platt Amendment on Cuba. Its seventh paragraph gave the USA the `right' to establish permanent military bases on Cuba. It was repealed in 1934, but the dictator Batista signed a new treaty allowing the USA to keep its huge military base at Guantanamo Bay.<br /><br />Gott shows how in 1959 the people defeated the US-backed dictator by relying on their own forces. He observes that the British and Yugoslavian governments armed Batista to the last moment.<br /><br />Gott possibly devotes too little attention to the Cuban people's successes in developing their country. He notes, without exploring, Cuba's remarkable achievements in health and education and he fails to mention its pioneering pharmaceutical industry.<br /><br />But he gives due prominence to Cuba's internationalism, particularly to its selfless military support to the Angolan people in 1988. Nelson Mandela later visited Havana to thank Fidel personally for Cuba's assistance in the struggle against apartheid, \\"The decisive defeat of the racist army in Cuito Cuanavale was a victory for all Africa  ... It made it possible for Angola to enjoy peace and establish its own sovereignty ... and for the people of Namibia to achieve their independence. The decisive defeat of the aggressive apartheid forces destroyed the myth of the invincibility of the white oppressor. The defeat of the apartheid army served as an inspiration to the struggling people of South Africa.\\"<br /><br />Cuba has a proud record of upholding workers' nationalism and of practical internationalism.

She examines the laws banning the use of force, civil wars, self-defence, collective self-defence, the use of force against terrorism, the UN and the use of force, Security Council authorisation for the use of force, and regional peacekeeping and enforcement actions.<br /><br />International law depends on the defence of nations' rights to self-determination, sovereignty and independence. She shows that the UN remains committed to the prohibition of any forcible intervention in the internal affairs of any nations.<br /><br />Gray maintains that the reasoning of the International Court of Justice in Nicaragua's case against the USA in 1986 is of paramount importance in this area because it is the Court's first extended discussion of the law on the use of force. The Court found that Nicaragua had not attacked anybody, but that the US government had illegally used force and intervened in Nicaragua. The Court rejected the US claim that its Contra war was justified as `humanitarian' intervention. The US state has refused to accept the verdict.<br /><br />Gray shows that the similar recent US/British attacks on Iraq and Yugoslavia were also illegal: \\"The use of the doctrine of implied authorization by the Security Council to justify the military action by the USA and the UK in Iraq in 1993 and 1998, by NATO in Kosovo and most recently by the USA, the UK and Australia in Operation Iraqi Freedom shows lip-service to the authority of the UN, but an unwillingness actually to accept the decisions of the Security Council.\\"<br /><br />As UN Secretary-General Kofi Anna said in 1999, \\"enforcement actions without Security Council authorisation threaten the very core of the international security system.\\" On 16 September 2004, he stated that the war on Iraq was illegal.

This total does not include the costs of the Common Fisheries Policy and of our chronic goods trade deficit with the EU (£20 billion in 2002).<br /><br />It costs us £20 billion a year to enforce the EU's regulations and directives (101,811 of them since 1973); the Common Agricultural Policy costs us £15 billion a year; and we pay £5 billion a year net into the EU Budget.<br /><br />These costs will most likely increase as the EU grows, adding to the costs of the CAP and the regional development funds. The new Constitution, by centralising more functions in Brussels, will also increase the EU's costs.<br /><br />The government claims that EU membership is good for us because it encourages new foreign investment. However, most foreign investment in Britain is not building new factories but overwhelmingly in the form of acquisitions and mergers. All research proves that most acquisitions reduce firms' value.<br /><br />If we were to accept the new Constitution, we would be forced into the euro, without ever voting for it. The euro would also be bad for us. The Bank of England says that joining the euro would cost us £10 billion a year in lost output, because we would lose all control over our monetary policy. The Treasury agrees that the costs of joining would outweigh the benefits. Changing from sterling to euro would cost £30-40 billion.<br /><br />Independence from the EU would be particularly good for British industry. As the US International Trade Commission notes, leaving the EU would stimulate Britain's output and bring new jobs in mining, iron and steel, other manufacturing and services.<br /><br />Labour's talk of lost jobs is just its usual scaremongering.

The most mind-changing essay for this reviewer was Ronald Bailey's `Cloning babies is not inherently immoral'.<br /><br />Throughout history, some have violently opposed scientific developments. For example, Guardian columnist Jeremy Rifkin described biotechnology as `a form of annihilation every bit as deadly as nuclear holocaust, and even more profound'. This dispute between science and anti-science, progress and reaction, the materialist and idealist philosophies, can never be resolved. It is a fundamental philosophic divide that cannot be bridged. One or other must prevail.<br /><br />The argument that we must wait for a consensus to emerge is reactionary, for this would mean waiting forever. No amount of additional debate can ever win round the opposition to progress, because that opposition is entrenched behind ramparts of dogma; faith-based, it is impervious to evidence and reason.<br /><br />Presidential calls for a moratorium are prevarication. Similarly, the search for absolute safety, like all searches for absolutes, is a delusion, which makes the precautionary principle another recipe for stasis.<br /><br />Some who oppose cloning opposed In Vitro Fertilisation earlier. Possibly one million babies have been born through IVF since 1978. This safe and beneficial procedure arose from decades of refining techniques in a variety of animals. Safe cloning will similarly result from animal research: a ban on research would prevent work into making cloning safe.<br /><br />In Germany the government has banned all research work on embryos, so Germany makes no contribution and has no influence on this matter. Britain's parliament passed a law that regulates therapeutic cloning, but unfortunately bans all efforts at reproductive cloning.<br /><br />Fear of biotechnology has done great harm, because technological stagnation poses greater risks than technological innovation. Banning stem cell research or research into reproductive cloning would prevent many promising developments in medical research; it could drive research to countries less equipped to balance safety with development. The biotechnology revolution has already brought enormous benefits, IVF for instance, and will bring many more, but only if we encourage and support research into cloning.gnation poses greater risks than technological innovation.

It failed to get the Al Qaida leadership, which had attacked the USA. Then Bush, with Labour's support, attacked Iraq, which has never attacked the USA, killing, according to The Lancet`s recent estimate, more than 100,000 Iraqi civilians, mostly women and children.<br /><br />The US occupation government in Iraq and its puppet have kept Saddam's labour laws banning some trade unions and forbidding all strikes. In June 2003, US troops stormed the Iraqi Workers' Federation of Trade Unions' offices and arrested its leaders.<br /><br />The authors trace the bones of empire in the drive for oil and bases. They describe the Bush crowd and Bush himself. They note the traditional US ruling class aim of `scaring the hell out of the American people.' As ever, empire brings aggressive wars `to prevent war', violent military occupations and vile war crimes.<br /><br />The US is indeed a giant with feet of clay. Its military forces are dispersed over 153 countries. Its leadership is pathetically inadequate to the impossibly huge tasks of running an empire. Its economy is overstretched. The government deficit was $375 billion last year, the trade deficit $435 billion, so Bush had to borrow $500 billion abroad. An empire in decline produces chaos at home and abroad.<br /><br />How do the authors suggest that we beat this empire? By building links between the campaigning environmental, peace and anti-globalisation groups, and by ever-bigger demonstrations and Forums! But occasional international contacts between activists change nothing. The endemic failures of the Second and Third Internationals prove this beyond doubt.<br /><br />Their approach is pure anarchism. It rejects working in trade unions and rejects workers' nationalism - it is a recipe for permanent subjection and defeat. Only solid working class politics, rooted in national trade unions, can defeat the capitalist classes who run the empires.in trade unions and rejects workers' nationalism - it is a recipe for permanent subjection and defeat.

Extradition is the process whereby one sovereign state asks another to return someone so that he may be brought to trial on criminal charges. The Act resulted from the EU's Treaty of Amsterdam 1997, which defined a new `European Legal Space' based on the `Mutual Recognition of Foreign Judgements'.<br /><br />Knowles points out that the Act originated from two fallacies: that proceedings under the Extradition Act 1989 were unnecessarily lengthy, and \\"that EU countries should have unquestioning deference for each other's legal systems.\\"<br /><br />As he observes, the Act sacrifices liberty `in the interests of speedy (and cheap) justice' leaving `few remaining safeguards for extradition defendants'. The Act `aims to speed up extradition by removing protections for defendants'.<br /><br />Under the new European Arrest Warrants, innocent British citizens could be swiftly extradited to EU countries, where we may not get a fair trial. France and Italy, for example, are routinely cited for police brutality and non-respect of defence rights. For the first time, defendants can be extradited for conduct that is not criminal under Britain's domestic law.<br /><br />Under the European Convention on Human Rights (in force here since 2000), extradition is forbidden if there is a real risk of flagrant denial of justice in the requesting state, e.g. if the trial is based on evidence obtained by torture, or if there is `a real risk of ill-treatment' of the defendant, or if there is a real risk of the defendant's being sentenced to death. For example, in 2002, a British court quashed Blunkett's decision to return Mr Ramda to France because of unanswered allegations that the French police had obtained evidence against him through torture.<br /><br />And in April 2003, in an Extradition Treaty with the USA, the government agreed that Britain would extradite British citizens to the USA in future, with no US obligation to produce prima facie evidence of their guilt. The agreement was, typically, one way only. Under this Extradition Act, our courts would have to enforce all such unjust decisions.future, with no US obligation to produce prima facie evidence of their guilt.

Elections can be part of a state-building project or peace process: in Cambodia in 1992-93 the UN empowered a transitional administration which held elections and then withdrew. But UN administrations have held election after election in Bosnia since 1995, and in Kosovo since 1999, but show no signs of leaving.<br /><br />The `Ombudsperson Institution' in Kosovo reported in 2002 that the UN `Interim' Administration there \\"is not structured according to democratic principles, does not function in accordance with the rule of law, and does not respect important international human rights norms. The people of Kosovo are therefore  deprived of protection of their basic rights and freedoms three years after the end of the conflict by the very entity set up to guarantee them.\\"<br /><br />In Iraq, troops will stay after the January election, till the end of 2005, we are told. But this hostile military occupation after an illegal invasion is neither building an independent state, nor achieving peace. Likewise in Afghanistan: rebuilding there is negligible (completed reconstruction projects totalled less than $200 million by May 2003), and warlords still rule the country.<br /><br />The US state has interpreted civil wars, humanitarian crises, lack of democracy, and `failed and failing states' as `threats to international peace and security', and has taken control of such states. Its constants are military occupation for bases, pipelines and oil, in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq alike.

Naughtie recalls that when he asked Pentagon insider Richard Perle what came next after Afghanistan, Perle replied, \\"The really important thing is that there is a next.\\"<br /><br />So, in January 2002, Bush set the timetable for invading Iraq and told Blair. Blair then promised to join Bush's war, secretly changing government policy from peace to war, without telling anybody.<br /><br />Naughtie writes that the `bloodstream' of the US-British special relationship is the intelligence linkage. Indeed, the USA's intelligence services are the world's biggest and most expensive. Yet all the US intelligence claims about Iraq's WMD - the uranium oxide bought from Niger, the mobile chemical laboratories - have been proven false. US intelligence was so bad that the CIA's head resigned, and his deputy left too.<br /><br />The Labour government had all these intelligence resources behind them. Yet their notorious government dossier on WMD was largely pilfered from a ten-year-old PhD thesis! So what, exactly, did Britain gain from this so-special relationship and its precious `bloodstream'?<br /><br />As a result of the illegal invasion of Iraq, there is now an illegal occupation of Iraq. Naughtie quotes a senior Foreign Office man who described the US's occupation policy as `a catastrophe from beginning to end'.<br /><br />When Naughtie asked Blair if he agreed with the White House lawyer who said that the Geneva Conventions were `quaint', Blair replied, \\"Of course not.

Successive chapters study the roles of the European Commission's staff, its hired experts, the European Parliament's staff, lobbyists, the Council of Europe's Secretariat-General, and the European Court of Justice.<br /><br />The Commission is the main unelected legislator. It sets the agenda for the EU, initiates policy and produces much of the specific content of EU laws. It has executive functions too. The Council of Ministers, supposedly responsible for passing laws, only decides 13% of them! In 2001, 85% of EU laws were delegated, in 18 directives, 600 regulations and 651 decrees, produced by the Commission's `comitology' system of 450 committees, plus its 1,000 expert committees and another 300 working groups.<br /><br /> In discussing lobbyists, the book omits the most powerful lobbies, the European Roundtable of Industrialists (comprising 45 Chief Executive Officers of the biggest firms in Europe, including Royal Dutch/Shell, British American Tobacco and Krupp), and the US Chamber of Commerce. Yet big business rules the EU. For example, the Liberal, Christian Democrat and Socialist MEPs all tabled identical amendments supporting the tobacco companies - a triumph for the lobbyists!<br /><br /> The Council of Europe's Secretariat-General is central to the continual process of Treaty reform (playing a key part in drafting the new EU Constitution) and in the EU's foreign, security and military decisions.

The United States-led NATO decision was not a response, as claimed, nor a comparable modernization program. It was a major new escalation of the arms race and an attempt, by circumventing SALT [Strategic Arms Limitation Talks], to tip the overall strategic balance as well as the European nuclear balance to the advantage of the United States and NATO.\\" (page 969.)<br /><br />He also points out that the USSR was not an aggressor on the world stage, contrary to the lies put about by Reagan et al. As he writes, \\"All the cases of direct coercive use of Soviet military power occurred in its directly adjacent national security zone - Hungary (1956), Czechoslovakia (1968), and Afghanistan (December 1979-February 1989). Each case was unquestionably perceived by the Soviet leaders as strategically defensive and protective against counterrevolutionary challenges, although objectively and analytically the actions were coercive. While the defensive nature of the Soviet action may not have been accepted, the significance of the subjective perceptions of a defensive purpose should not have been neglected in evaluating the question of a Soviet propensity to use force and in predicting whether, where, and when the Soviet Union might again have done so.<br /><br /> On the whole the United States used its own military forces coercively more frequently ...\\" (page 744.)<br /><br />On the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, Garthoff wrote that to the Soviet leaders, \\"It was seen as the only solution to a specific situation on their borders that was threatening Soviet security.\\" (page 1037.) \\"the Soviet decision was a reluctant recourse to defend vital interests.\\" (Page 1074.)<br /><br />Garthoff concludes, \\"There is no evidence that the Soviet leaders ever contemplated launching a military attack on the United States - or against NATO.\\" (page 1153.) The US state, not the Soviet Union, raised the danger of nuclear war by its hodtility to any arms control agreements: as Gerthoff writes, \\"Regrettably, by the early 1980s, they [the Soviet leaders] came to see little prospect for arms control because of the shifting American stand. The United States had ratified none of the arms limitation treaties it had signed since 1974 and it had repudiated the SALT II Treaty signed in 1979.\\" (page 1156.)<br /><br />This extraordinary book gives a realistic picture of the US and Soviet records, and it gives the evidence needed to make intelligent judgements about world affairs.en as the only solution to a specific situation on their borders that was threatening Soviet security.\\" (page 1037.) \\"the Soviet decision was a reluctant recourse to defend vital interests.\\" (Page 1074.) <br /> <br />Garthoff concludes, \\"There is no evidence that the Soviet leaders ever contemplated launching a military attack on the United States - or against NATO.\\" (page 1153.)

This huge study is valueless, because its statistics and conclusions are derived solely from the authors' fevered imaginations. They prefer prejudice to evidence, blind anti-communist 'faith' to reason. The recently opened Russian archives show that the true figure of Soviet citizens who died in the 1930s is about 300,000 deaths.<br /><br />Most writers on the subject, including the authors of this tome, have relied not on the archives, but on Robert Conquest's estimates. Richard Evans, Professor of Modern History at Cambridge University, has explained how Conquest reached his figures: \\"Robert Conquest's The Harvest of Sorrow: Soviet Collectivization and the Terror Famine (New York, 1986) argues that the `dekulakization' of the early 1930s led to the deaths of 6,500,000 people. But this estimate is arrived at by extremely dubious methods, ranging from reliance on hearsay evidence through double counting to the consistent employment of the highest possible figures in estimates made by other historians.\\"<br /><br />For example, the American historian Charles Maier stated that Stalin was responsible for more deaths than Hitler. But Evans observed that Maier could only reach this conclusion by accepting \\"Conquest's implausible and inflated estimates without question, while omitting deaths caused by Nazi aggression in the East (which also, apart from military and exterminatory action, led to famines and deportations). The number of deaths caused by Nazism's eastward drive may itself have been as many as 20 million.\\" (Richard Evans, In Hitler's shadow, Tauris, 1989, page 170.) In fact, to reach his judgement of comparative responsibility, Maier simply omitted all the 50 million people killed in the world war that Hitler started.<br /><br /> It's also worth remembering that it was the Red Army who defeated 70% of Hitler's armies. It was the Red Army who played the largest part in stopping Hitler, the greatest mass murderer of the 20th century.	2004-10-11

He also idolises Congressman Charlie Wilson, a good ol' Texan, a coke-snorting, whisky-guzzling, whoring, arms-dealing, freeloading, hit-and-run drunk-driver, who constantly broke US laws to arrange aid for the terrorist cause.<br /><br />Crile ignores the fact that the US intervened first in Afghanistan, supporting reactionary terrorists trying to overthrow the progressive government: on 3 July 1979, President Carter signed a secret directive authorising covert aid to the mujehadin. The CIA promoted drug trafficking to raise funds for them. The British, French and Israeli governments all sold arms to them. Only in December 1979, five months after the US intervention, did Soviet troops enter Afghanistan, at the Afghan government's request, to defend the people against the terrorist onslaught.<br /><br />The CIA, assisted by Thatcher, spent $1 billion a year arming and training more than 300,000 Islamic mercenaries drawn from around the world to fight against Afghani national liberation. Crile tells us that MI6 did much of the CIA's dirty work, `murder, assassination, and indiscriminate bombings'. It was the CIA's biggest operation, far bigger than their terrorist Contra operation in Nicaragua, indeed the biggest secret war ever.<br /><br />The CIA-organised Contras targeted schools, clinics and hospitals: so did the mujehadin, and more so. The Contras \\"raped, tortured and killed unarmed civilians, including children\\" and \\"groups of civilians, including women and children, were burned, dismembered, blinded and beheaded\\", as the CIA told a Congressional Intelligence Committee. So did the mujehadin, and more so. The CIA's special favourite was the repellent criminal and fascist Gulbuddin Hekmatyar who was \\"responsible for the practice of throwing acid in the faces of Afghan women who failed to cover themselves properly\\".<br /><br />In the end, Gorbachev withdrew the Soviet forces from Afghanistan, and the mujehadin proceeded to wreck Afghanistan and attack their sponsor the USA. Crile claims that the withdrawal destroyed the Soviet Union.

Franco could see that Koestler was going to be more use to him alive than dead, and this book indeed proves that Koestler was an asset to the forces of reaction.

In the 1930s, Kaganovich was Stalin's deputy on party matters, a secretary of the Central Committee, secretary of the Moscow Regional Party Committee, and Stalin's deputy in the Defence Commission. Despite the intentions of the anti-Soviet editors, we can learn much about how the Soviet working class governed the Soviet Union.<br /><br />During these years, the Soviet working class collectivised agriculture, industrialised the country and hugely expanded the health and education services. The first Five-Year Plan (1928-33) successfully laid the foundations of a heavy industry able to re-equip the national economy. This reconstruction doubled industrial output between 1929 and 1933, while the capitalist world was mired in slump. The Soviet working class built a workers' state in the teeth of hostile encirclement by the capitalist states, and of sharpening class struggle in the country and in the party.<br /><br />The Soviet Union also, alone, aided the Spanish Republic's heroic struggle against the Hitler-Mussolini invasion. Stalin urged that the Soviet Union sell oil, grain and food to the Republic `on the most favourable terms for them'.<br /><br />The book shows how the capitalist class used splits in the Bolshevik party, supporting oppositions `left' or `right' to try to defeat socialism and restore capitalism. The party continually struggled to defeat the kulaks (the rural capitalist class) and the Opposition.<br /><br />The Opposition assisted the Soviet Union's enemies abroad and adopted a strategy of terrorism: Trotsky wrote, \\"Inside the Party, Stalin has put himself above all criticism and the State. It is impossible to displace him except by assassination. Every oppositionist becomes ipso facto a terrorist.\\"<br /><br />In 1936, the Soviet Union responded by trying members of the Anti-Soviet United Trotskyite-Zinovievite Centre for their terrorist activities, including the assassination of Sergei Kirov, a member of the Politburo. This focused and open response is surely a better way to fight terrorism than the Bush/Blair method of holding terrorist suspects forever without charge or trial.ivities, including the assassination of Sergei Kirov, a member of the Politburo.

So health care is becoming a commodity as in the USA, where billing and marketing make up 30% of health care costs. In the USA, fraud by health care companies totalled $418 billion in 1990-95. For example, Columbia/HCA (allegedly helped by the British consultancy firm KPMG) defrauded the government of $1.7 billion.<br /><br />In 2004, Labour lifted the ceiling on health administration costs, which had already doubled, cutting clinical care budgets so that there are fewer beds in PFI hospitals. Labour excludes doctors, nurses and health professionals from hospital management, while welcoming failed businessmen.<br /><br />Surgery performed in private hospitals costs 40% more than in NHS hospitals, because of higher costs and the overriding need to return a profit to the shareholders. Private borrowing is dearer too and the risks are not transferred to the private sector. Labour has arranged public spending data and NHS accounts to hide the huge amounts of public money going straight through the NHS to private companies.<br /><br /> In 2002, Labour privatised practice premises through the introduction of Local Improvement Finance Trusts, which shifted control of primary care services from GPs to corporations. And Labour has forced local authorities to divest themselves of all their social service assets, including long-term care for the elderly, ending equal access to equal quality of care for older people.<br /><br />Labour uses dirty PR tricks to defeat public opposition - smearing public services, lying about the huge inefficiencies of market-based health and social care, overriding evidence, bullying and sacking critics.

The authors are Michael Riley, Senior Lecturer in History at Bath Spa University, Jamie Byrom, Adviser for History in Devon, and Christopher Culpin, Director of the Schools History Project.<br /><br />The authors tell stories, some well-known, like the capture of Quebec, some less so, like the election of the Indian nationalist Dadabhai Naoroji to the House of Commons in 1892. They compare interpretations of the Empire, asking students to think about why people have such different views of it.<br /><br />The authors would claim to be balanced, but their interpretation is not without bias. For example, they present the British seizure of India as defensive: they \\"took control ... when rival traders from France or local Indian princes tried to force them out.\\"<br /><br />They repeat the old description of the conquest of Africa as the `scramble' for Africa, which is like describing a rape as a fumble. They write, \\"British farmers and miners moved into Africa\\" as if they were entering a new home, rather than stealing land in the wake of wars and massacres.<br /><br />The authors ignore too much about the Empire: its standard technique of `divide and rule', that caused so many post-independence wars; `Butcher and Bolt', the army's preferred way of war; and the monocultures the Empire imposed, that distorted so many nations' economies.<br /><br />The authors raise the question of the costs and benefits of empire, but make no estimates. If Britain's trade `made her rich', as they claim, why are so many here still so poor?<br /><br />The authors' `balanced' view, giving equal weight to `good intentions' and evil outcomes, prettifies the Empire: their viewpoint is as immoral as a similarly `balanced' view of slavery would be. The material reality, beneath the fake ideals and intentions, is that the benefits of empire accrued solely to the British ruling class.

Bush	Books	4	19	24	N	N	Useful study of Bush's rhetoric	In this book, Peter Singer, Professor of Bioethics at Princeton University, studies the ethics of President George W. Bush. More than any other President, Bush justifies his policies in terms of the fight of good against evil.<br /><br />In Part 1, Singer contrasts Bush's rhetoric of opportunity with the reality of class. Bush's faith-based politics cover class-based economic policies. He claims to uphold a culture of life, while freely using the death penalty, even for mentally retarded prisoners. He opposes stem cell research, despite its contribution to prolonging life. He boasts that the USA is the freest nation on earth, despite the evidence.<br /><br />In Part 2, Singer looks at Bush's international role. Claiming to uphold free trade and generous aid, Bush spends more on subsidising 25,000 US cotton growers than he provides in aid to Africa.<br /><br />After 9/11, he stretched his aim from attacking Al Qa'ida to toppling the Taliban regime. Singer shows how the attack on Afghanistan was not just, because Bush rejected negotiations, so the war was not the last resort that it should have been. Nor was the war for a just cause, because it went beyond what was necessary to prevent further terrorist attacks. And he allows US forces to use interrogation methods that the State Department calls torture when other governments use them.<br /><br />The war against Iraq was a diversion from the just war against Al Qa'ida, and has only increased the threat of terrorism. Pax Americana, like the old Pax Britannica, is just an endless series of imperial wars, strategically and morally wrong.<br /><br />In sum, Singer shows how Bush (like his lackey Blair) uses value-talk to claim that he is moral, despite all the evidence. When his policies fail to produce the good results he predicted, he blames other, `evil', people. The worse the consequences, the more moral the rhetoric.<br /><br />Finally, we should recognise that Bush's lies and confusions consistently serve the interests of the US ruling class. These interests conflict with the interests of workers everywhere, and with America's real interests, the interests of American workers, the vast majority of the American people.serve the interests of the US ruling class.

He concludes that the war was unnecessary and damaging.<br /><br />He notes that US government aims to dominate the world through preventive wars. But, as he writes, \\"Preventive war ... is indistinguishable from aggression. ... it is a prescription for endless conflict\\", for `an endless series of wars to end all wars'. This is `both strategically and morally wrong'. It is `imperialism pure and simple'.<br /><br />He urges that the US should wage war only against Al Qa'ida, not against terrorism in general, nor against Iraq: Bin Laden attacked the USA; Saddam never did. The notion of an undifferentiated terrorist threat is misleading, as it was in the 1960s when the US state wrongly saw Vietnam as an agent of China, which it wrongly saw as an agent of the USSR.<br /><br />Of Iraq, Record observes that Cheney said in March 2002, \\"We will be greeted as liberators.\\" Record explains why it is false to compare Iraq to post-war France, or Germany or Japan. Iraq is a quagmire, like the Lebanon was for Israel (1982-99), or as Palestine is for Israel now, or as Iraq was for Britain (1920-58).<br /><br />The occupation of Iraq has cost more than $220 billion so far, paid for by Americans, not by Iraq's oil. American workers oppose an everlasting war of occupation: 60% of Americans opposed Bush's demand for another $87 billion for the occupation.<br /><br />Record observes that it is wrong to dismiss attacks on US forces `as simply reactionary terrorist attacks having no legitimacy and requiring no response other than traditional counterterrorism'. They are guerrilla warfare: \\"assaults on U.S. troops, at least in Iraq, hardly qualify as terrorist attacks because those troops are combatants in an army of occupation'.<br /><br />Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations, has said that the war on Iraq was illegal, so the consequent occupation is illegal too, and US and British troops there are illegal foreign combatants.

It is a unique example of a country's selfless aid.<br /><br />By contrast, US and British foreign policy in Africa has been squalid and self-interested. In 1964, in a secret CIA operation, assisted by MI6, the US state armed, organised and transported 1000 mercenaries (mostly South African and Rhodesian) into the Congo. The mercenaries raped, pillaged, tortured and killed the Congolese people.

Henri Spaak, the Belgian Prime Minister, one of the key figures in the founding of the EEC, at US orders allowed Zaire's government to recruit mercenaries in Belgium, breaking Belgian law.<br /><br />The USA and South Africa cooperated in arming and training terrorist UNITA forces in Angola in 1975. In October 1975, South African armed forces invaded Angola. The US, British and French governments all pressed the South African government to keep going, to capture Luanda, Angola's capital.<br /><br />Cuban forces entered Angola in November, and played the decisive role in turning back the invaders - a historic defeat for apartheid, which should never be forgotten. In 1976, Britain's Labour government aided the recruitment of mercenaries to support UNITA's efforts to destroy Angola and its newly elected government, allowing 200 of them to leave Britain, many without passports.<br /><br />In 1991, Nelson Mandela visited Cuba and rightly said, \\"We come here with a sense of the great debt that is owed the people of Cuba.

Reflections on Justice and Nationhood	Books	4	22	25	N	N	Useful study of Middle East quagmire	Part 1 is a reprint of Chomsky's 1974 book, Peace in the Middle East? examining the 1967 war and its results.  Part 2 looks at the same themes of Israel, Palestine and the US role, from the perspective of 2002. Part 3 studies the world after 9/11 and the `war on terror'.<br /><br />Israel, like most US dependencies, has huge inequality, great and growing poverty, high and rising unemployment, falling wages and worsening working conditions. It constantly expands its illegal settlements in the occupied territories, cuts the Palestinians' water quotas, and imprisons Palestinians in areas sealed by a net of bypass roads meant for Jews only.<br /><br />Israel organises torture, terror, the destruction of tens of thousands of homes, and detentions without trial. Under Israeli occupation, Palestine's unemployment has doubled, investment has halved, income is down 20%, and GNP is down 40%. When the Security Council reaffirmed that the 4th Geneva Convention applies to occupied territories, Clinton abstained.<br /><br />In mid-September 2000, the US shipped attack helicopters to Israel, and US Marines conducted joint exercises with elite units of the Israeli Defence Force. On 29 September, Sharon made his infamous, government-authorised visit to the Temple Mount, with a thousand armed guards. On 3 October, Israel signed its biggest arms deal for a decade, buying 35 Blackhawk military helicopters from the USA. In February 2001, Israel bought nine Apache attack helicopters. Curiously, this huge backing for Israel went virtually unreported.<br /><br />In December 2001, the USA vetoed a Security Council Resolution calling for international monitors to oversee a reduction in violence. The USA has consistently rejected a Palestinian state: as elsewhere, nationalism is its enemy.<br /><br /> The USA is repeating the British Empire's Middle Eastern failures. Dean Acheson said that Britain `may act as our lieutenant (the fashionable word is partner)'. Britain is still the lieutenant in Iraq; Israel is now the lieutenant in Palestine, bleeding from its doomed struggle to kill off Palestinian sovereignty. In its Middle East colonies and dependencies, the British Empire created an `Arab façade' to have `the outward semblance of sovereignty'.

The US ruling class hijacked the war on terrorism and aimed it at `universal dominion'. The authors describe this as `a highly imprudent trajectory of missionary imperialism and international confrontation'. They ask whether the US's policy \\"distracts the United States from the pursuit of terrorism and whether it may indeed aggravate the threat\\" and conclude that it does.<br /><br />Rupert Murdoch's Fox News helped Bush: its watchers were three times more likely to believe the government's three big lies - that Al Qa'ida and Iraq were linked, that WMD had been found, and that the world approved of the US attack. These misperceptions `arose as the direct result of deliberate government action'; administration speeches showed `a pattern of deceit'.<br /><br />Now the US government is bogged down in the quagmire of Iraq, dragging British troops down with it. It said that just 75,000 troops could occupy Iraq, and only `several thousand after a year or two'. It told Congress that Iraq's oil, not the US taxpayer, would pay for the occupation.<br /><br />However, the US army is not geared to occupying a country, still less to nation-building; it is designed to carry out the old imperial practice of `Butcher and bolt'. Not too surprising then, that the USA's occupation of Iraq is failing, just like earlier British occupations in the Middle East, in Iraq, Palestine, Aden, etc.<br /><br />In sum, the authors show that the costs of US foreign policy are huge, including economic damage, vast expense, reduced civil liberties and worse security. Unfortunately, they see this disastrous policy as due to the neo-conservatives' seizure of power, not as the inevitable result of capitalism's absolute decline.re huge, including economic damage, vast expense, reduced civil liberties and worse security.

In Part One, he shows that the US wars on Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq were wars of aggression, and reminds us of the Nuremberg verdict, \\"To initiate a war of aggression ... is the supreme international crime.\\" The UN Charter rightly upholds this: aggressive war is the worst of crimes, because from it flow all other crimes: murder, rape, torture, terrorism.<br /><br />In 1999, the US attacked Serbia, on the pretext of stopping ethnic cleansing, but without UN authority. The US used the International Criminal Tribunal of the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) to portray its aggression as law enforcement, although the ICTY's first President admitted that the war was illegal. Intervention, whatever the signboard, violates international law and state sovereignty.<br /><br />Bush has perverted the just, self-defensive war against Al Qa'ida into unjust, aggressive wars against nations: the attack on Afghanistan has killed 20,000 Afghanis so far, about half of them civilians. Afghanis now say, \\"We were better off under the Russians.\\"<br /><br />Only four of the 15 Security Council members voted for Bush and Blair's war against Iraq. They went ahead anyway, unauthorised, illegally. Warmonger Richard Perle wrote, `Thank God for the death of the UN'.<br /><br />In a brilliant discussion of `collateral damage', Mandel reminds us that in law a defendant is equally guilty of murder whether he desired the death, or merely knew that his act was likely to cause death. Part IV of Protocol One to the Geneva Conventions forbids all attacks \\"which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects.\\" So NATO's perennial excuse, that it does not target civilians, fails.<br /><br />Part Two studies how international criminal law works. The ICTY from its start worked with NATO, refusing even to consider whether NATO's attack on Yugoslavia was a war of aggression.

Their ruling assumption is that the US state is innocent and benign.<br /><br />In Chapter Two, he compares the media handling of two similar events: Korean Air Lines 007, shot down by a Soviet jet in 1983, and Iran Air Flight 655, shot down by a US ship in 1988. The first was judged as a murderous attack, `wanton, brutal and deliberate', proof of Soviet moral bankruptcy, portrayed with pictures of the dead and much empathy, outrage and generalisation. The second was seen as a tragic accident, `understandable, mistaken and justified', a technical glitch, described in the passive voice, in abstract language, with no pictures, no generalisation and no blame.<br /><br />In Chapter Three, Entman looks at the media treatment of the US attacks on Grenada, Libya and Panama. The media presented coherently only the administration's view. Typically, CBS's anchor Dan Rather said they were \\"not sure exactly what was happening but knowing the teams. It was the US against Qaddafi\\". Entman concludes, \\"The analysis demonstrates how journalists served as more or less loyal conduits of U.S. government propaganda in wartime.\\" It seems that the first rule of the US state's news management is `lie early and lie often'.<br /><br />In Chapter Four, Entman examines the media's `great debate' about the war on Iraq, which, it appears, was between those who wanted war at once and those who wanted war later. 71% of the Americans who appeared on camera were pro-war, just 3% against.<br /><br />Entman shows how the state portrays the enemy as a threat, then uses a brief `wave of patriotism' to rubbish dissent. The state pretends that it is responding to public opinion, and claims that the media reflect public opinion: both notions support the ruling pretence that the public governs. In Chapter Six, Entman disproves all these myths by showing how the US state, with media assistance, beat back the hugely popular movement for a nuclear freeze., Entman disproves all these myths by showing how the US state, with media assistance, beat back the hugely popular movement for a nuclear freeze. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-09-09

He differentiates this from other forms of terrorism, because of its genocidal intent and worldwide scope.<br /><br />Chapter 1 looks at what winning and losing this war would mean. A proper strategy must include a justified war of self-defence focusing on Al Qa'ida, international law enforcement, and addressing the causes that recruit people to this form of fundamentalism. We must understand, not to forgive individual terrorists, but to change the social conditions that give rise to terrorism.<br /><br />Chapter 2 examines 9/11's causes and effects, Chapter 3 the war on Afghanistan. Chapters 4, 5 and 6 look at how Bush has twisted the war against Al Qa'ida into unlimited, perpetual war for US domination. Bush has smeared all national liberation struggles as terrorist and delegitimised, sanctioned and isolated what he calls `rogue' states. He wars against Iraq, and threatens Iran, Cuba, Libya, Syria and others. Falk shows that the Al Qa'ida threat does not justify the assault on Iraq or any other country.<br /><br />Chapter 7 criticises the US state's attacks on American society. Chapter 8 looks at our world, where \\"American assertiveness is no longer deterred by the Soviet presence.\\"<br /><br /> From Clinton's `unreserved embrace of predatory globalization' to Bush's worldwide empire-building and warmongering, the US approach has meant `unconditional authorisation for state violence'. Attacking civilians and their homes is terrorism, whether done by states or by anti-Castro exiles, Chechen rebels, Palestinian `suicide bombers', or Animal Liberation Front fundamentalists.<br /><br />Falk mostly upholds the UN Charter's prohibition on non-defensive force. Yet he backed the USA's 1999 war in Kosovo and its attack on Afghanistan (which was not limited to attacking Al Qa'ida) because he privileges the ideal of transnational government over national sovereignty.<br /><br />We must uphold the democratic right of all nations to self-determination, which includes the right to self-defence against all schemes for global or continental domination, US or EU empires.

He accuses multinational corporations, the European Union and the World Trade Organisation of being threats by their interference in nations' internal affairs.<br /><br />He opposes the USA's \\"exploitation of the legislative powers of the WTO, which threatens the sovereignty of everyone else.\\" The WTO argues that national sovereignty is a `block on free trade' and that MNCs should be able to sue national governments if they are denied `investor rights', as when governments give preference to domestic firms.<br /><br />He applauds anti-globalisation protests by peasant farmers and local communities as `gestures of deep patriotism, against a presumptuous force that roams the world like a tempest, vandalising everything in its path'. He opposes free trade noting that it includes `taking advantage of sweated or even slave labour'. He deplores `the destruction of local food economies by multinational agribusiness, the overriding of local property laws and barriers to migration, ... the control of vital services in one country by people who are citizens of another'. Doesn't all this make Scruton our ally against predatory capitalism?<br /><br />Adopting the EU Constitution would violate Britain's present constitution and our sovereignty as a nation. We would be subjects, not citizens, of the EU, because our laws would be subject to EU decision and our new EU rulers would be unaccountable and irremovable. How could we transfer our national and class loyalties to the European Commission, a junta of unelected foreign capitalists?<br /><br />We need not share Scruton's particular vision of Englishness to agree that the nation state is a far better basis for peace and prosperity than any transnational order. He makes a substantial case, unimpaired by what to most people will seem some eccentric judgements.<br />	2004-09-09

He analyses the absolute decline of the capitalist world-economy, from its genesis in 1450 through its development to its current `period of terminal crisis'. We now endure economic stagnation, political instability and social pathologies.<br /><br />He points out that there is no escape from class struggle, internally between those for and those against a more democratic and egalitarian society, externally between those defending nations' sovereignty and those upholding the imperial `right to intervene'.<br /><br />He has some dazzling insights - \\"The idea that leaders sell out, just like the idea that the masses are falsely conscious, seems to me analytically sterile and politically disabling.\\" But there are weaknesses too, as when he focuses on the `left' and on `anti-systemic movements', rather than on the mass, on the necessity for every country to develop workers' nationalism, to control speculative flows of capital and labour.<br /><br />Workers are the immense majority in the world. Migration from rural areas into labour markets has enabled capitalists to relocate, particularly to China. But the world is running out of new sources of cheap labour, and within a generation the new workers learn how to organise for better wages. So wage levels are rising as a percentage of production costs, averaged across the world. Also, taxes to pay for health, education and welfare are rising. Higher wages and taxes squeeze global profits, threatening capitalists' ability to accumulate capital, especially from industrial production.<br /><br /> So the USA is a colossus with feet of clay. Its economy is faltering, and it cannot use its military muscle to shape the world the way it wants. Unable to prevail over China and Korea, defeated by Vietnam, it is now trapped in the quagmire of Iraq.<br /><br />Wallerstein concludes, \\"In the history of the world, military power has never been sufficient to maintain supremacy.

Yet the apartheid government used Huntingdon's writings, as when he backed it against `the worse alternative' of a government led by `the revolutionaries of the ANC'. He advised the apartheid government that increased authoritarianism might be necessary for reform, rationalising its repression, and he backed its `centralization of power'.

It also shows that parents should allow their children to be immunised with MMR. The author is a London GP, who has an autistic son James.<br /><br />Dr Fitzpatrick reminds us of the dangers of measles, mumps and rubella. In the ten years before the first measles immunisation was introduced in Britain, 850 children died from measles. Since MMR immunisation was introduced in 1988, there have been only four deaths from measles, and 19 from complications. Japan, with a low uptake of MMR immunisation, has 50/100 measles deaths a year.<br /><br />So the government is right to encourage mass MMR immunisation and to oppose the individual choice of separate vaccines, even though its promotion of `individual choice' and `personalised care' undermines all good NHS policies. The government's `faith-based' politics - evident in Blair's refusal to say whether his son Leo had been immunised - align it against both the medical profession and scientific evidence.<br /><br />The original article that sparked the MMR immunisation scare, by Dr Andrew Wakefield, only raised the possibility of a relationship between MMR immunisation and autism: it put forward no evidence of a causal link, and specified no mechanism of transmission. In the subsequent five years, he has failed to substantiate his claim.<br /><br />Since then, many independent researchers have proven that there is no causal link between MMR and autism, but Dr Wakefield refuses to accept the overwhelming evidence. He even told a US senate committee that the Royal Statistical Society had damned an important study that refuted his hypothesis, although this was not true. He has now moved to a private clinic in Florida run by an evangelical Christian.<br /><br />We still know too little about the neurobiological framework of autism.

He shows what an important role Stalin played in building socialism in the Soviet Union, in defeating the Nazi tyranny in World War Two, and then in leading the postwar rebuilding of the Soviet Union.<br /><br />Without a capitalist class, and without capital from abroad, without profits from exploiting people in other countries, or investment by foreign firms, or foreign aid, the Soviet people built an economy that transformed the Soviet Union from the backward semi-colonial land of the tsars into the second industrial, scientific and military power in the world. They collectivised agriculture, and created an iron and steel industry, and tractor, car, machine tool, chemical, agricultural machinery and aircraft industries. They produced electricity, coal and oil. There was no unemployment, and people had free housing, free education and free health care: children got free vitamins. The late Lord Bullock, not the friendliest witness, wrote, \\"the achievement of the Russian people on the economic front, under the Soviet system and Stalin's leadership, was remarkable.\\"<br /><br />Capitalist forces, internal and external, fought to prevent these working class achievements. The Soviet Union had to fight a war of self-defense against internal fascism, supported from outside. As the recently opened Russian archives show, during the 1930s approximately 300,000 people were killed in this war. This figure is far lower than the numbers publicised by, for example, Robert Conquest. Richard Evans, Professor of Modern History at Cambridge University, has explained how Conquest reached his exaggerated figures: \\"Robert Conquest's The Harvest of Sorrow: Soviet Collectivization and the Terror Famine (New York, 1986) argues that the `dekulakization' of the early 1930s led to the deaths of 6,500,000 people. But this estimate is arrived at by extremely dubious methods, ranging from reliance on hearsay evidence through double counting to the consistent employment of the highest possible figures in estimates made by other historians.\\"<br /><br />Almost all subsequent writers and propagandists on the subject have relied completely on Conquest's hugely inflated estimates. For example, Charles Maier, an American historian, stated that Stalin caused more deaths than Hitler. But Maier omitted the 20 million deaths caused by the Nazi aggression.<br /><br />Stalin had warned in 1931, \\"We are fifty or a hundred years behind the advanced countries. We must make good this lag in ten years. Either we do it, or they will crush us.\\" Astonishingly, the Soviet people reached this goal: between 1928 and 1937, industrial production had increased each year by 16.5%. As Mark Arnold-Forster wrote in The world at war, \\"The first plan and its successors ensured Germany's eventual defeat in World War Two.\\"<br /><br />Stalin sought with every means in his power to stay out of war, whereas Hitler did all that he could to start it. The 1939 pact with Germany gave the Soviet Union an enormous strategic advantage in the inevitable war ahead. From the Black Sea to the White Sea, the USSR was able to shift its entire Western boundary 200-300 kilometres further West. And in the vulnerable northwestern sector, the border became shorter by almost 600 kilometres, so Leningrad and Kronstadt were now deep within Soviet territory, whether approached from the Baltic states or from Finland.<br /><br />In June 1941, when Hitler's blitzkrieg menaced the Soviet Union, the Defence Ministry and the General Staff both urged Stalin to transfer a larger number of divisions from the reserves to the Western borders. Stalin rightly refused. The decision to keep the main forces of the Soviet army 200-300 kilometres from the border was absolutely correct.<br /><br />After Hitler attacked the Soviet Union, \\"Russia tore the guts out of the German armies\\", as Churchill wrote, destroying 70% of the Nazi divisions. Henri Michel, the French historian,wrote, \\"The Soviet victory was the Red Army's victory, but it was also the victory of the Soviet economy and of the Bolshevik regime ... finally, this victory was Stalin's victory.\\" Without Stalin's leadership of the Soviet Union, Hitler would have won the war and Britain would have been defeated and occupied. We all owe a huge debt to Stalin and the Soviet people.<br /><br />In August 1945, General Eisenhower flew from Berlin to Moscow and \\"did not see a single house standing intact from the Russian-Polish border to Moscow. Not one.\\" The Soviet Union, with Stalin's leadership, made an extraordinary recovery from unparalleled devastation. It built the atomic bomb, successfully deterring a US/British nuclear attack. It launched the world's first satellite, the Sputnik, and sent the first man into space, Yuri Gagarin.<br /><br />Less than forty years after Stalin's death, Mikhail Gorbachev traduced Stalin, claiming that this would restore true Leninism. Yet when Stalin was, temporarily, effaced, Lenin and Marx went too. Gorbachev and Yeltsin adopted Trotsky's policies of demolishing the collective farms and selling concessions to foreign powers. The leader of Trotsky's `Fourth International', Ernest Mandel, wrote approvingly, \\"The reformer Yeltsin represents the tendency which wants to reduce the gigantic state apparatus.

But similarly, these other revolutions would also need to receive help from others: the Russian revolution could not survive without a revolution in Germany, but neither could a German revolution survive without a Russian. This mutual dependence meant that no country could ever start a revolution: it would have to wait on the success of another.<br /><br />So to provoke these indispensable other revolutions, Trotsky was quite prepared to invade other countries. For example, in 1919 he wrote, \\"A cavalry corps of 30-40,000 horsemen must be formed to invade India.\\"<br /><br />Similarly, at Brest-Litovsk in February 1918, Trotsky made the Soviet revolution's very survival depend on the putative German revolution, risking total defeat by the German army on the throw of a revolution in Germany. He said, \\"We declare we end the war but do not sign a peace. They will be unable to make an offensive against us. If they attack us, our position will be no worse than now ...\\" This phrase-mongering did not frighten the German generals, who saw only that Trotsky was refusing to sign the offered peace. They then attacked, as he said they could not do, and seized millions of square miles of Soviet territory, making the Soviet position far worse than before.<br /><br />In the 1930s, the Opposition leagued with Hitler. Churchill wrote, \\"The German government was in touch with important Russian personalities through the Soviet embassy in Prague. The plot aimed at overthrowing Stalin and introducing into Russia a new pro-German regime. Soviet Russia carried out a merciless but doubtless useful purge of political and economic circles. The Soviet army was purged of pro-German elements.\\" Goebels admitted, \\"Stalin got rid of all the opposition circles in the Red Army and thus succeeded in making sure there were no more defeatist groups in the Army.\\"<br /><br />The Opposition fought against the programmes of industrialisation and collectivisation that made possible all the Soviet Union's heroic achievements. For instance, in April 1930, Trotsky's Bulletin of the Opposition said, \\"Put a stop to `mass collectivisation'. ... Put a stop to the hurdle race of industrialisation. ... Abandon the `ideals' of self-contained economy. Draw up a new variant of a plan providing for the widest possible intercourse with the world market.\\" In 1938, Trotsky called for the collective farms to be closed down, and for Soviet enterprises to be handed over to foreign powers.<br /><br />He consistently called on the Soviet people to overthrow the Soviet government when Hitler attacked. He called for a `revolutionary uprising', an `insurrection' against the Soviet government, when Hitler attacked the Soviet Union. He wrote, \\"the impetus to the Soviet workers' revolutionary upsurge will probably be given by events outside the country.\\" \\"The first social shock, external or internal, may throw the atomized Soviet Society into civil war.\\"<br /><br />He asked, \\"Can we expect that the Soviet Union will come out of the coming great war without defeat? To this frankly posed question, we will answer as frankly: If the war should remain only a war, the defeat of the Soviet Union would be inevitable. In a technical, economic and military sense, imperialism is incomparably more strong. If it is not paralysed by revolution in the West, imperialism will sweep away the present regime.\\" \\"The defeat of the Soviet Union is inevitable in case the new war shall not provoke a new revolution. ... If we theoretically admit war without revolution, then the defeat of the Soviet Union is inevitable.\\"<br /><br />He wrote, \\"It would be childish to think that the Stalin bureaucracy can be removed by means of a Party or Soviet Congress. Normal, constitutional means are no longer available for the removal of the ruling clique. ... They can be compelled to hand over power to the Proletarian vanguard only by FORCE.\\"<br /><br />\\"Inside the Party, Stalin has put himself above all criticism and the State. It is impossible to displace him except by assassination. Every oppositionist becomes ipso facto a terrorist.\\"<br /><br />Trotsky lied to the `Dewey Commission' when he told them that that he had not been organising an underground in the Soviet Union.<br /><br />The leader of Trotsky's Fourth International, Ernest Mandel, openly applauded Boris Yeltsin, the key figure in the counter-revolution that finally restored capitalism in the Soviet Union.

Chapter 1 studies the relationship between war and international law.  Chapter 2 looks at the controversy over the Iraq War and concludes that there is `no evidence of any involvement by Iraq' in the 9/11 terrorist attacks.<br /><br />Chapter 3 debates the issues of international law and morality raised by the two wars and their implications for human rights. He concludes, \\"Once prisoners of war were taken and other persons were detained then, in principle, the European Convention on Human Rights came into play on the basis that those persons were within the effective control of the detaining state (assuming it is a state party to the ECHR). The UK submission in Bankovic appeared to concede this point. In relation to a post-conflict situation in Iraq, this was covered by the reference to `effective control of the relevant territory and its inhabitants abroad as a consequence of military occupation'.\\"<br /><br />Chapter 4 investigates the legality of the Iraq War. McGoldrick cites Professor Vaughan Lowe, \\"It is simply unacceptable that a step as serious and important as a massive military attack upon a State should be launched on the basis of a legal argument dependent upon dubious inferences drawn from silences in Resolution 1441 and the muffled echoes of earlier resolutions, unsupported by any contemporary authorisation to use force. No domestic court or authority in the United States or the United Kingdom would tolerate governmental action based upon such flimsy arguments.\\" McGoldrick adds, \\"On the evidence there was no justification under self-defence or humanitarian intervention.\\" He concludes, \\"the US and the UK acted illegally.\\"<br /><br />Chapter 5 studies the consequences of the US-British attack for the international legal system. Chapter 6 looks at post-war Iraq's economy and politics and the war's effects on the Middle East. Chapter 7 surveys the two wars' effects worldwide.

Part 1 looks at the development from the 1834 revolt against the Ottoman empire, the start of modern Palestine, to the 1936-39 revolt against the British ruling class, who decimated Palestinian institutions, to Zionism's benefit. It shows how the Europe-dominated world market, Zionism and government intervention framed the Palestinian nation. Part 2 examines the dispersal of 1948. Part 3 looks at how the Palestinian nation was reborn in resistance against occupation, up to the 1987 Intifada.<br /><br />Part 4 studies the Oslo peace agreement of 1993, negotiated away from the Washington talks. Large majorities of both the Israeli and the Palestinian peoples backed Oslo. The left, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and the diaspora, conspicuously Edward Said, opposed it - all put the right of return above every other consideration.<br /><br />Oslo negotiated a two-state settlement - two states for two peoples. It involved explicit acceptance of each other's existence, and mutual acceptance of the idea of partition, with agreed borders between the two states. Both sides renounced violence, and committed themselves to cooperation, negotiation and peaceful coexistence.<br /><br />Its gains included Israeli withdrawal from the urban areas of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, and the first establishment of Palestinian self-government. Yet between 1993 and 2000 successive Israeli governments undermined the agreement by doubling the numbers of settlers in the West Bank.<br /><br />For the future, the authors conclude, \\"Neither people can achieve peace without fulfilling some of the most deeply held the aspirations of the other.\\" Israel will have to make concessions on settlements, the refugees' right of return, a capital city in Jerusalem, and Palestinian control over sufficient water resources. It must end the brutal, illegal occupation, and - the key issue - it must accept a sovereign Palestinian state.<br /><br />The alternative is that both sides strive for maximalist goals involving mutual denial, which will lead only to their mutual destruction.ufficient water resources.

Now, in re-occupying Palestinian territories, Israeli forces have killed 250 Palestinian children, and 72 Israeli children have been killed. Since September 2000, 2,546 Palestinians and 892 Israelis have been killed, and 23,930 Palestinians and 5,973 Israelis have been injured. 2,202 Palestinian homes have been completely destroyed, and 14,436 partially; one Israeli home has been destroyed<br /><br />Sharon's strategy is failing: killing Palestinians and destroying their society is not protecting Israeli citizens from terrorist acts; Jews are safer anywhere else in the world.

Having written an overrated history of the British Empire, he here tackles the US empire.<br /><br />He tells the Americans how to run their empire, even criticising Bush for being `too diplomatic'. \\"I write not as a carping critic but as an avid admirer of the United States who wants it to succeed in its imperial undertakings.\\"<br /><br />Ferguson backs General MacArthur's approach in the Korean war, that the US should drop atomic bombs on China and Korea. When he writes of `casualties in Vietnam', he means US casualties, ignoring the three million Vietnamese killed by US aggression.<br /><br />Ferguson notes, without explaining, that all the US interventions in Latin America, Central America and the Caribbean never produced a single democracy. He claims that Cuba supports terrorist groups, ignoring the 40 years of terrorist attacks on Cuba from Florida.<br /><br />He sneers, \\"Like all revolutionary regimes, Khomeini's Iran was soon embroiled in a war with its neighbour.\\" He ignores the US backing for Saddam's attack.<br /><br />He aims to give us a cost/benefit analysis of empire but gives us instead a stream of caricatures and smears. For Britain, empire meant capital exported abroad rather than invested in British industry and jobs. The ruling class gained its profits through imperial theft; the working class lost the work. India under the Empire grew only 0.12% a year, because, says Ferguson, it got too little British investment. But independent India has grown far faster.<br /><br />From the facts of increasing wars, poverty and inequality, he deduces that there is still too little movement of capital and labour. He complains that workers are generally too well paid and leisured, and that the costs of Medicare and Social Security threaten to capsize the US economy.<br /><br />Ferguson is the flash Harry of contemporary history-writing, cavalier with the facts, crude in his views and contemptuous of most of the world's peoples. His book is one long, unsuccessful, attack on the democratic right of national independence.r />Ferguson is the flash Harry of contemporary history-writing, cavalier with the facts, crude in his views and contemptuous of most of the world's peoples.

Willis discovered the human brain's role and importance, and was the first to examine how it worked.<br /><br />Willis was part of the remarkable generation of Britons who founded the Royal Society, aiming to understand the physical world: William Harvey, who by discovering the circulation of the blood had, as Willis said, created `a new foundation of medicine', Christopher Wren, Robert Hooke, Robert Boyle and William Petty, whom Karl Marx called the father of political economy.<br /><br />To keep the Restoration Stuart state on side, they excluded from the Society the materialist Thomas Hobbes, who had said that the mind was `matter in motion'. As the Platonist Henry More realised, `No spirit, no God'.<br /><br />Willis' book `The Anatomy of the Brain and Nerves' mapped the brain, and was the first unified treatment of the brain and the nerves. The new science combined anatomical study of the human brain with comparisons to animal brains, experiments and medical observations. He identified the loop of arteries that supplies the brain, which became known as the Circle of Willis. The 20th century neurologist Lord Brain described Willis as `the Harvey of the nervous system'.<br /><br />Willis \\"created a material explanation of the soul and its disorders. ... He had transformed the traditional three-part soul, which had existed since Plato, into the corpuscular chemistry of the nervous system. The soul was not just moved to the brain but limited to it, and only through the nerves could it experience the world.\\"<br /><br />But the idealist philosopher John Locke attacked Willis' materialist approach, holding back neurology's development. Zimmer explains, \\"Locke also influenced the way philosophers pondered the mind itself. He dismissed details of neurology and concerned himself with ideas and how they fit together, and generations of philosophers followed his lead. It would take neurologists 150 years to show that Willis was right, that studying the anatomy and chemistry of the brain can indeed reveal the workings of the mind, that they can map the geography of passion, reason, and memory.\\"s followed his lead.

Stalin had warned in 1931, \\"We are fifty or a hundred years behind the advanced countries. We must make good this lag in ten years. Either we do it, or they will crush us.\\" Astonishingly, the Soviet people had reached this goal: between 1928 and 1937, industrial production had increased each year by 16.5%. The historian Lord Bullock, not the friendliest witness, wrote, \\"the achievement of the Russian people on the economic front, under the Soviet system and Stalin's leadership, was remarkable.\\" (Alan Bullock, Hitler and Stalin: parallel lives, Fontana, 2nd edition, 1998, page 843.)<br /><br /> The Soviet people transformed their country from the backward semi-colonial land of the tsars to the second industrial, scientific and military power in the world. There was no unemployment, and the people had free education, free housing, free welfare and free health care: children were given free vitamins.<br /><br />But capitalist forces, internal and external, fought to prevent these working class achievements. The Soviet Union had to fight a war of self-defense against internal fascism, supported from outside. The recently opened Russian archives show that during the 1930s approximately 300,000 people were killed in this war. This figure is far lower than the numbers publicised by, for example, Robert Conquest, the anti-Soviet propagandist and sometime speechwriter for Margaret Thatcher.<br /><br /> Richard Evans, Professor of Modern History at Cambridge University, explains how Conquest reached his exaggerated figures: \\"Robert Conquest's The Harvest of Sorrow: Soviet Collectivization and the Terror Famine (New York, 1986) argues that the `dekulakization' of the early 1930s led to the deaths of 6,500,000 people. But this estimate is arrived at by extremely dubious methods, ranging from reliance on hearsay evidence through double counting to the consistent employment of the highest possible figures in estimates made by other historians.\\"<br /><br />Almost all subsequent writers and propagandists on the subject have relied on Conquest's hugely inflated estimates. For example, Charles Maier, an American historian, stated that Stalin was responsible for more deaths than Hitler. But, as Evans observed, Maier could only reach this conclusion by accepting \\"Conquest's implausible and inflated estimates without question, while omitting deaths caused by Nazi aggression in the East (which also, apart from military and exterminatory action, led to famines and deportations). The number of deaths caused by Nazism's eastward drive may itself have been as many as 20 million.\\" In fact, to reach his judgement of comparative responsibility, Maier simply omitted all the 50 million people killed in the world war that Hitler started. Unfortunately, Evans' important conclusions have not received the attention that they deserve, probably because they challenge the consensus, not just because Evans hid them in lengthy footnotes!<br /><br />After the war, the Soviet Union, led by Stalin, made an extraordinary recovery from unparalleled devastation. In August 1945, General Eisenhower had flown from Berlin to Moscow and \\"did not see a single house standing intact from the Russian-Polish border to Moscow. Not one.\\" Yet the Soviet people rebuilt their industry and agriculture.

He quotes John Prescott, \\"We are all middle class\\" - true enough of Labour Ministers and their cronies.<br /><br />But the world's first industries and the world's first industrial cities were built by the world's first working class. In this book, trade unions are almost invisible - a walk-on part when Manchester Town Hall opened in 1878, a demand for better conditions for Glasgow's tramworkers, but Hunt cannot see the working class's role in creating industry, only `restrictive labour practices'.<br /><br /> He approves the Victorian economist James Mill's arrogant and idealist claim that the capitalist class contains `the heads that invent, and the hands that execute' and `the men who in fact think for the rest of the world'. The reactionary diatribes of Carlyle, Pugin and Ruskin, and the bourgeois triumphalism of a Macaulay, were equally idealist.<br /><br />Too often, Victorian capitalists had prestige projects built, at the cost of urban development, putting palaces before people. Self-styled merchant princes, seeing themselves as the new Medici, romanced `Saxon self-government' and smugly rejected planning for public health.<br /><br /> The Victorian ruling class saw London as the imperial city, with its irredeemable natives. Hunt sees people's moves to the suburbs and to garden cities as wilful failures to solve London's problems, and joins Betjeman, Orwell, Williams-Ellis and Priestley in snobbish hatred of the suburbs, despite acknowledging that many people do want to live there.<br /><br /> Hunt calls for a restoration of local democracy, noting that in the 1890s, Londoners elected 12,000 of their fellow-citizens to run hospitals, schools and transport; now 36,000 quangocrats decide for us. Successive governments' rate capping, surcharging and cash limits have weakened the `innovative local government and civic pride' that Hunt celebrates, yet he ignores completely the biggest current threat to local (and national) democracy - Labour's EU-driven regionalisation policy.<br /><br />He applauds the knowledge economy - though isn't all productive work knowledge-based? But we also need steel, ships, vehicles and clothes, which we should be producing ourselves, instead of relying on imported goods.e `innovative local government and civic pride' that Hunt celebrates, yet he ignores completely the biggest current threat to local (and national) democracy - Labour's EU-driven regionalisation policy.  <br /> <br />He applauds the knowledge economy - though isn't all productive work knowledge-based?

But as this mean-minded book shows, this hardly qualified him to write `the real' biography of Fidel Castro.<br /><br />This book gives the Foreign Office view, brimming with anti-trade union, anti-national and anti-communist sneers. For example, he casts doubts on Fidel's brother's parentage, citing as evidence Raul's `slanted oriental eyes', but even the book's photos disprove this.<br /><br />Coltman patronisingly assumes that Britain can give lessons in democracy to Cuba, but how many of us voted Mandelson an EU Commissioner? Coltman smugly assumes that capitalism means progress, but capitalism, a mode of production, does not make technological innovations or scientific advances: the working class makes them all. He cannot describe US imperialism and the illegal US blockade without putting the offending words in inverted commas.<br /><br />He claims that the Macmillan government's decision to sell the Cuban dictator Batista warplanes and tanks was `commercial rather than political', because Britain's economic situation was `desperate'.  When Macmillan refused to sell Hawker Hunter fighters to Castro to defend Cuba against imminent US aggression, the situation was presumably not so desperate. Kennedy's illegal assault on Cuba showed that Bush's practice of unilateral, aggressive war is nothing new.<br /><br />Cuba's eight million people have sustained independence and sovereignty, repelling all efforts to interfere in their internal affairs. So Fidel rightly opposed the Sandinistas' 1989 decision to bow to US-EU demands to hold multi-party elections in Nicaragua: the Sandinistas even let the US government fund the opposition.<br /><br />He warned, \\"Some people think they can save socialism by making concessions. They fail to take account of the voracious mentality of imperialism and of the reactionary forces. If you give them part of a fingernail, they will want part of your finger; if you give them a piece, they will want the whole finger; if you give them the finger, they will ask for the forearm; if you give them the forearm, they will ask for the arm; and when you give them the arm, they will chop off your head.\\"If you give them part of a fingernail, they will want part of your finger; if you give them a piece, they will want the whole finger; if you give them the finger, they will ask for the forearm; if you give them the forearm, they will ask for the arm; and when you give them the arm, they will chop off your head.\\" <br /> <br />	2004-08-14

Chapters cover the Vietnamese people, why the USA attacked Vietnam, US atrocities, the guerrilla warfare, the US protests, the US soldiers, Vietnam and Cambodia after the war, and the USA and the world after the war. But unfortunately, the book is a Trotskyist account, so it is completely misleading about all the key elements of the war.<br /><br />For example, Neale supports the US government's continuing hostility to Vietnam when he smears the Vietnamese government as `corrupt'. He parrots the US state's point of view, writing that the Vietnamese government \\"signed a mutual defence treaty with Russia late in 1978, and that pushed them into war with Cambodia and China.\\"<br /><br />This is a travesty of the truth. From 1975 onwards, the murderous Pol Pot regime in Cambodia, backed by the US state, had continuously attacked Vietnam, killing tens of thousands of people, until in December 1978 the Vietnamese counter-attacked and freed Cambodia.<br /><br />And China that attacked Vietnam in 1979, not the other way round, after the US state had given Deng Hsiao-Ping the green light. Neale claims that \\"the victims of this war were the Chinese minority in Vietnam\\", again taking the US state's point of view, that the Vietnamese government was the aggressor, not the Chinese government.<br /><br />This is typically Trotskyist - just enough class analysis to be plausible to a few, but always backing the counter-revolution at key moments, backing the US state in its counter-revolutionary attack on the Vietnamese people. Similarly, Trotskyists backed the kulaks against the Bolsheviks in the 1930s, the landlords in Hungary in 1956, the mujehadin in Afghanistan in 1989, and Boris Yeltsin in the Soviet Union in 1990.<br /><br />Trotskyists always pontificate about other people's struggles, patronisingly telling the Vietnamese what they should have done at every moment, yet they never get it right for their own country.<br /><br />Anyone interested in the Vietnamese people's historic victory over US imperialism should read Ho Chi Minh's writings, not this shoddy book.tnamese what they should have done at every moment, yet they never get it right for their own country. <br /> <br />Anyone interested in the Vietnamese people's historic victory over US imperialism should read Ho Chi Minh's writings, not this shoddy book. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-08-14

Chapter One, `The myth of the reluctant superpower', exposes the nonsense that the US state just responds to events, improvising as it goes, containing others' aggressions, going to war only in necessary self-defence. Bacevich notes that the US state's \\"purpose is to preserve and, where both feasible and conducive to U.S. interests, to expand an American imperium.\\" He shows the basic continuity of US foreign policy, \\"the unflagging self-interest and large ambitions underlying all U.S. policy.\\"<br /><br />Globalisation expresses US economic, political, military and cultural supremacy, maintained by unilateral aggressive wars, through military proconsuls, gunboats and Gurkhas. The US state claims that its `internationalism' is progressive and `isolationism' is backward, that the USA is the vanguard of history, the pioneer, leading the world to the future of peace and prosperity.<br /><br />But a single dominant power brings not peace but perpetual war: the Pax Britannica involved Britain in war every single year while the Empire lasted. The same holds for the USA, ever since 1898.<br /><br />Since the Soviet Union's suicide, US warmongering has speeded up: since 1989, the USA has made 47 overseas military interventions, following a consistent strategy for US empire. Clinton's war in Somalia killed between 6,000 and 10,000 civilians, two-thirds of them women and children, according to a senior US officer. The illegal war against Kosovo, ostensibly humanitarian, became a full-blooded war against Serbian civilians, killing at least 1,500. In Afghanistan, US forces have so far killed between 1,000 and 4,000 civilians.<br /><br />US forces are now stuck in Iraq, where they have killed more than 13,000 civilians. The US naval victory at Manila Bay in 1898 led to forty years of occupying and `pacifying' the Philippines. How long will we tolerate this increasingly genocidal war against the Iraqi people?<br /><br />Bacevich calls for honestly recognising that the USA is an empire, so it can be run morally and realistically. But empire, founded on exploitation and repression, denies democracy, abroad and at home. It is reactionary, not progressive, and can no more be run morally than slavery can.e? <br /> <br />Bacevich calls for honestly recognising that the USA is an empire, so it can be run morally and realistically.

He explodes the myth that the market, not the government or the universities, built the Internet.<br /><br />What he calls the `conservative ascendancy' is really just corporate power leading to a corporate state. All the polls show that the American people have far saner views than either wing of the capitalist party. But in the USA, money talks, so much so that its courts now hold that the First Amendment's protection of free speech protects the absurdly high levels of election spending.<br /><br />The ruling class has turned the USA into the most unequal of all developed countries: its great and growing inequality means that it has the least opportunity, the least social mobility and the fewest escapes from poverty. The USA is failing economically: average wages were 10% lower in 1999 than in 1973. In 2000, it had lower annual incomes per head than Norway, Switzerland, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Luxembourg. Between 1960 and 2000, productivity grew more slowly in the USA than in Britain, France or Italy.<br /><br /> Hodgson raises, but does not answer, the question why, after the Soviet Union's suicide, world peace and prosperity did not ensue. What caused the wars and slumps of the 1990s? The Soviet Union's demise proved that it was not the Soviet Union that prevented peace and prosperity, but capitalism.	2004-08-14

The authors analyse how the bulletins described the conflict's causes, the casualties and the motives of the contending parties. The authors also study how people received the news.<br /><br />The authors found that the bulletins gave little background to the conflict's causes: in September and October 2000, when the second Intifada started, only 17 of 3,500 lines of text were on the conflict's history. Too often, the bulletins presented the conflict as a self-perpetuating cycle of revenge, as if World War Two happened because Britain and Germany kept bombing each other.<br /><br />The bulletins often said that Palestinians `died', or were `reported killed', or were `killed in violence' or `in clashes with Israeli forces'; it was left to the Guardian to be direct, for instance, \\"six Palestinians were killed by close-range bullets at the mosque by Israeli police.\\" Both BBC and ITV repeatedly repeated the Israeli claim that a twelve-year old boy, Mohammed al-Durrah, was `killed in crossfire', although their TV coverage clearly showed Israeli troops aiming at the boy: ITV even quoted President Clinton repeating the Israeli lie.<br /><br /> The authors found a consistent bias towards the Israeli government's perspective. In interviews, Israeli representatives had twice as many lines of text as Palestinians. The bulletins often accused Arafat, but never Sharon, of using violence for political ends, even though Sharon openly opposes the peace process. Bulletins reported Palestinian `claims' of torture and murder by Israeli forces, but never checked whether the claims were true. Bulletins sympathetically discussed the Israeli government's tactics, perspectives, security concerns and rationales, but not the Palestinians'.<br /><br />The bulletins always presented the US government favourably. They assumed that it `even-handedly' seeks peace, never mentioning the frequent US vetoes of UN Resolutions, its massive annual gifts to Israel, or its open support for Sharon and hostility to Arafat.<br /><br />Like all the Glasgow University Media Group's work, this is scholarship of the highest standard: it makes an invaluable contribution to our understanding of the conflict.umed that it `even-handedly' seeks peace, never mentioning the frequent US vetoes of UN Resolutions, its massive annual gifts to Israel, or its open support for Sharon and hostility to Arafat.  <br /> <br />Like all the Glasgow University Media Group's work, this is scholarship of the highest standard: it makes an invaluable contribution to our understanding of the conflict. <br />	2004-08-14

Nicholas Fox demolished it in 1993, Paul Gross and Norman Levitt in 1994, and John O'Neill in 1995.<br /><br />Now Wolin reprises that postmodernism reprised the counter-Enlightenment, concluding banally, \\"Postmodernism's hostility towards 'reason' and 'truth' is intellectually untenable and politically debilitating.\\"<br /><br />Postmodernism was just a version of the ancient idealist claim that objective knowledge is impossible. Idealism is a dangerous, reactionary philosophy, whether religious or post-whateverist, because it denies knowledge, reason and truth, and denigrates science, industry, technology, democracy and socialism. It prefers metaphor, myth and magic.<br /><br />Wolin reminds us that Friedrich Nietzsche was a leading counter-Enlightenment writer, who preached, \\"The annihilation of the decaying races ... Dominion over the earth as a means of producing a higher type.\\" Naturally, Nietzsche adored the Roman Empire, Alexander the Slayer and Cesare Borgia.<br /><br />Later, Third Way theorists in the 1930s flirted with fascism. Martin Heidegger was an outright Nazi, and Carl Jung was a Nazi fellow-traveller. After the war, post-structuralists, like Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze and Michel Foucault, and postmodernists like Chantal Mouffe were briefly famous. All worshipped Nietzsche.<br /><br />But why does Wolin bother with these discredited poseurs? They have no influence now - who reads Heidegger? Who, apart from his publisher Verso, has ever heard of Mouffe?<br /><br />Wolin's attacks on German and French philosophy chime in with the US state's attacks on 'old Europe'. So Wolin plays up the German and French New Rights, just as Labour plays up the BNP. He obediently links Al Qa'ida with Iraq, and sneers at national liberation struggles, absurdly lumping Fidel Castro with Idi Amin, Mobutu and Duvalier.<br /><br />Wolin reveals his hostility to democracy when he writes of \\"the regressive social psychological tendencies displayed by the masses.\\" Finally, he praises the USA's \\"breathtaking social mobility ... in striking contrast with Derrida's tradition-bound, native Europe.\\"<br /><br />Recent research has proved that the USA has even less social mobility than Europe's nations, but Wolin, in a postmodernist kind of way, doesn't let mere facts get in the way of capitalist dogma!ls his hostility to democracy when he writes of \\"the regressive social psychological tendencies displayed by the masses.\\" Finally, he praises the USA's \\"breathtaking social mobility ... in striking contrast with Derrida's tradition-bound, native Europe.\\"  <br /> <br />Recent research has proved that the USA has even less social mobility than Europe's nations, but Wolin, in a postmodernist kind of way, doesn't let mere facts get in the way of capitalist dogma!  <br />	2004-07-24

He uses these to detail how the US ruling class seeks to rule the world.<br /><br />It seeks ?full spectrum dominance?, weapons in space, greater powers of attack through ?ballistic missile defence?, and the break-up of all international treaties and agreements that might limit its ambitions. Chomsky argues that the US ruling class threatens an earthly wasteland.<br /><br />He explains that the Republican-Labour doctrine of preventive war justifies all aggressions: Japan at Pearl Harbour and Hitler attacking the Soviet Union also claimed ?anticipatory self-defence?. He points out that the US and British states constantly use the Security Council to flout UN Resolutions; their record numbers of vetoes prove them to be its worst non-compliers.<br /><br /> Chomsky reminds us that the old British Empire proclaimed the right to ?humanitarian intervention?. Liberals like John Stuart Mill defended this, writing shameful apologetics for the imperial crimes of aggression against India and China, and for France?s atrocities in Algeria, ?exterminating the indigenous population?, as its War Minister urged. The liberal David Lloyd George praised the British government?s sabotage of Disarmament Conferences by ?reserving the right to bomb niggers?. Now Blair?s adviser Robert Cooper writes, ?the need ? for colonisation is as great as it ever was in the 19th century.?<br /><br />Chomsky notes that today?s imperialists commit war crimes too: President Clinton flew Al Qa?ida terrorists from Afghanistan to fight for the US side in Bosnia. Labour imperialists backed the Kosovo Liberation Army terrorists, even though Defence Minister George Robertson admitted, ?the KLA was responsible for more deaths in Kosovo than the Serbian authorities had been.?<br /><br /> The same forces drive empires past and present: John Maynard Keynes explained, ?the democratic experiment in self-government was endangered by the threat of global financial market forces.?

Aryanism suggested that this whole region had originally been peopled by successive waves of vigorous Aryans, culminating in British colonisation. Ballantyne traces how this idea ?was used to naturalise, justify and celebrate British colonisation of South Asia.?<br /><br />Chapters 1 and 6 look at imperial notions of India, which were used as a template for understanding other colonised societies. Chapters 2 to 5 examine how the Empire used these to try to control New Zealand?s Maori society. As ever, the empire exploited existing social divisions, to divide and rule, while claiming that it freed the most exploited from bonds of caste and priestly power. It called its domination ?liberation?, its exploitation ?development? and its wars ?pacifications?.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Ballantyne commits what we may call the scholarly fallacy, asserting that the empire was woven together by webs of relationships, modes of discourse, rather than hammered into place by the capitalist mode of production. Only in passing does he note that the East India Company, the revenue manager for Bengal, collected increased revenues while famine killed a third of the people. Under Empire, rule, regular famines, in 1770, 1783 and throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, killed tens of millions.<br /><br /> Ballantyne does not challenge the imperial myth that settlers, both military and missionary, benefit the host country, not their own individual gain. This is now transmuted into the liberal myth that immigrants benefit the host country.<br /><br />He claims that there was a ?progressive? side of Aryanism, inclusive, globalising and non-racist. He praises the imperial policies of free flows of labour and products and ideas, and he opposes all forms of nationalism as exclusive and racist. This fits neatly into the Empire?s hostility to ?backward-looking? nationalism, and it also suits US imperial policy today.<br /><br />But empire is always undemocratic, because it is based on rule by one class over other nations.

So half its people live in worsening poverty, a third are unemployed, and foreign debt totals $400 billion.<br />Nieto focuses on the Cuban revolution and its effects. In March 1959, President Eisenhower ordered CIA sabotage and terrorism against Cuba. Kennedy was worse: Nieto writes, \\"His policies opposing the Revolution were more aggressive than Eisenhower's.\\" Two days before the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, US planes bombed Cuba's cities, under Kennedy's orders. Kennedy started the US policy of counter-insurgency in Latin America (and Africa and Asia), supporting death squads and military dictatorships. Nieto shows how the US state sponsored counterrevolutionary wars in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Guatemala and Chile.<br />Johnson carried on Kennedy's policies: he backed the generals' fascist coup in Brazil in 1964, and attacked the Dominican Republic in 1965. Nieto depicts Reagan's wars - occupying Honduras, arming the death squads of El Salvador, running the Contras' terrorist war against Nicaragua, attacking Grenada - and Bush's attack on Panama.<br />The US state has never ceased its illegal, terrorist attacks on Cuba. The New York Times reported in 1983 how the head of a Miami-based anti-Cuban terrorist group admitted in a US court that he had taken germs to Cuba in 1980, proving Cuba's accusations of CIA biological warfare against Cuba. The US state made Armando Valladares - a former Batista police officer and convicted terrorist - ambassador and president of its delegation to the UN Human Rights Commission.<br />But the Commission's 1989 report refuted all the US slanders about Cuba's torture and abuse of political prisoners. The world knows now who tortures and abuses political prisoners detained without charge or trial.<br />Nieto's final chapter examines how Cuba has survived and kept its revolution going. The key is that its people, determined to defend their democracy, independence and sovereignty, actively prevent the counter-revolution from organising.prisoners.

Bush	Books	5	41	59	N	N	Hard-hitting study of creeping fascism	John Dean was counsel to President Richard Nixon, so he knows a thing or two about dirty tricks and cover-ups. Having studied the current presidency, he concludes that George W. Bush is even worse than Nixon.<br />Bush and his cronies hide stuff because there is lots to hide: Bush's hidden early career - his draft-dodging and his business frauds and failures, Vice President Dick Cheney's health secrets, his dodgy Halliburton deals, his secret Council for National Energy Policy Development Group, his shadow security and intelligence outfit (the Office of Special Plans) and his covert operation for the executive's survival.<br />Dean points out that Bush illegally uses executive privilege to overrule US law, as when he ordered that his, and his father's, presidential papers be sealed, breaking the 1978 Presidential Records Act. (Blair similarly used an order from the Privy Council to overturn British law and rob the Diego Garcia islanders of their right to return home.)<br />Dean demonstrates how Bush is destroying civil liberties by enforcing repressive laws. For example, 5000 Arab Americans have been detained, mistreated, and denied lawyers for more than two years; only five have been charged, and only one convicted. Dean shows how Bush criminalises dissent and controls the media, and how \\"mendacity has become policy.\\"<br />Dean observes how Bush exploited 9/11, while secretly scheming to scuttle all efforts to discover why the USA was so unprepared for the anticipated terrorist attack. He manipulated intelligence about Iraq's `WMD', transforming guesses and estimates into `facts'. Dean documents the nineteen distinct lies that Colin Powell told the UN, a key part of Bush's effort to trick the American people into the illegal attack on Iraq - an impeachable offence. Dean shows how Bush is implementing the US ruling class's plan to dominate the world.<br />Dean points out how this creeping fascism threatens what little remains of American democracy and its people's rights. To a British eye, it is striking how closely Blair resembles Bush, and how closely the Labour Party resembles the Republican party - the same slavering worship of wealth, the same contempt for democracy, the same arrogance of power.rights.

Chapter 2 looks at the opposition to the idea of European union that developed between 1945 and 1969. Chapter 3 studies the years of Britain's entry into the EEC, 1970 to 1974. Chapter 4 investigates the 1975 referendum on Britain's continued membership of the European Community. Chapter 5 views how attitudes to the European Community changed between 1979 and 1990. Chapter 6 describes the struggle against Political Union from 1990 to 1993. Chapter 7 brings us up to date with the struggle against Monetary Union since 1992, and Chapter 8 outlines the patterns and trends in Euroscepticism. Each chapter presents the situation, analyses the opponents, explores the arguments, describes the arena in which the politics were played out, and sums up the period.<br />Forster looks at the recent arguments about Economic and Monetary Union, both political and economic, and he judges that ceding control to a monetarist, deflationary European Central Bank would indeed both end our sovereignty and damage our economy. He shows that the ECB has no mandate to take jobs or growth into account, unlike the USA's central bank, the Fed, but that it focuses solely on inflation, just as Thatcher did. He notes that there is no flexibility in the Maastricht Treaty that set up the ECB, and that there is no possibility of rewriting it. He points to the growing democratisation of the debate's arena, particularly since 1975, which saw the first-ever ratification referendum, to 1997's hard-won promises of our first-ever decision-making referendum.<br />He concludes that in the euro \\"national governments' capacity to launch independent policies of wealth creation, employment generation and welfare improvement would be removed.\\" He judiciously sums up, \\"much as Britain in Europe sought to portray its opponents as such, the alliance against the euro was not extremist.\\"p, \\"much as Britain in Europe sought to portray its opponents as such, the alliance against the euro was not extremist.\\"	2004-07-06

He includes a 20-page list of donors, and notes that, purely coincidentally, Blair has created peers faster than any previous Prime Minister, and that he has given more than 2000 quango posts to businessmen. Not surprising then that 80% of us think that Blair gives special help to business donors!<br /> For example, the Texas-based utilities company Enron gave the Labour Party £38,000: Ralph Hodge, CBE, its head in Britain, said bluntly, \\"in the current climate, sponsorship and donations are the most efficient ways of getting access.\\" The company gave George W. Bush's election campaign $825,000. Enron had gained hugely from energy utilities privatisation and from energy price deregulation. It encouraged its workers to plough their savings and pensions into company shares. Just before the firm filed for bankruptcy with $55 billion debts, its top executives cashed in 17.3 million shares, while the workers were prohibited from cashing their shares! Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay, `Kenny Boy' to his good ol' pal George W., got $101 million! Now 25,000 former Enron workers are without jobs, without pensions and without savings, but with lots of worthless shares.<br /> Osler shows that Britain's economy is not working. As he writes, \\"British manufacturing has never been in worse shape, and Labour's macroeconomic policies must bear much of the blame.\\" Manufacturing industry is being wrecked, not by the pound, but by its overvaluation. Much-vaunted, high-quality private sector management has ruined Marconi and bankrupted Railtrack.  Inadequate investment, private and public, is damaging our future.<br /> Osler is scathing about Labour's Private Finance Initiatives, which were driven by Economic and Monetary Union's demand to cut public spending. PFI is like paying off your mortgage over 30 years, and then the building society repossesses your house! Companies enter the public services not to put money in, but to get money out! They are obliged by law to prioritise shareholders' interests, not public needs. Inevitably, disasters result, like Railtrack, privatised under EU Directive 91/440, and the Private Public Partnership scheme for London Underground, recently endorsed by the EU.<br /> Accountants Arthur Andersen produced a report saying that PFI worked, after it had advised the government on selling off air traffic control, Railtrack and the London Underground, but PFI did not work even for Andersen, which has had to be wound up. Even Labour's sad little thinktanks are sponsored, Demos, for instance, by British Gas, Cable &amp; Wireless, NatWest, Shell and Tesco: so it is not likely to find, for instance, that democracy involves expropriating the expropriators!<br /> In sum, Labour has embraced PFI, the World Trade Organisation, the euro and George W. Bush, advertising privatisation as public service, globalisation and Europeanisation as internationalism, and war as peace.<br /> This appalling record explains why Labour lost three million votes between the 1997 and 2001 elections, and in 2001, it won the votes of only 25% of those entitled to vote. Why should trade unions contribute to a party that fights tooth and nail against all that our members want?

Later, he condemns `the moral bankruptcy of Britishness': this is history-with-a-thesis.<br />There is a positive, post-empire, sense of Britishness, able to recognise diversity within the national unity. Weight cites a 1964 poll that showed that only 5% of us would be pleased to have a person of Asian or Afro-Caribbean origin as a colleague or neighbour; he fails to mention the 2000 poll in which 80% of us said that we would not be upset at this prospect.<br />Independence, even `independence within the EU', would not benefit Scotland and Wales. Weight notes that in 1997, for instance, England paid Scotland an extra £6.6 billion. People in Scotland and Wales have well-justified worries that they would be worse off on their own, which is why moves towards independence have stalled.<br />On the EU, Weight acknowledges, \\"The fact that Britain's leaders were determined to join come what may revealed a disregard for the views of the majority that would become a running sore in British society.\\" But he shares this undemocratic disregard, claiming that our \\"real problem was the deep and abiding scepticism of European integration at all levels of British society.\\" His problem is that most of us dare to disagree with him! He ends his book by trying to promote the EU, presumably tongue in cheek, `as a kind of social service providing counselling and alternative accommodation'!<br />Weight starts to provide an answer to Britain's real problem when he writes that we need to `invest properly in the economy of the whole island'. But we cannot rely, as he suggests, on financiers to do this: capitalism cannot do what we need to keep Britain united.

He explores thinking about war and strategy ranging from Machiavelli to the 1950s, relating the ideas to their cultural and historical contexts.<br />As he writes, \\"New ideas emerge during periods of revolutionary change or at times of crisis, in response to great historical challenges.\\" The great strategic thinkers Jomini and Clausewitz developed their revolutionary ideas in response to the French Revolution.<br />Gat argues that World War One's massive slaughter forced a paradigm shift from Clausewitz's ideas to the new idea of limited war. But Julian Corbett, limited war's greatest theorist, first published his ideas before 1914. Corbett argued, like Clausewitz, that wars were means to an end, continuations of policy. But he showed that wars could take many forms, with differing limits, depending on their political aims.<br />Gat exaggerates the importance of J. F. C. Fuller in the interwar period. Fuller plagiarised Ernest Swinton, who first proposed using tanks offensively in numbers to achieve breakthrough. Fuller fantasised that tanks alone could win wars, without infantry and combined arms.<br />Gat also over praises Basil Liddell Hart, who idealised limited war, just part of Britain's military experiences. In the 1930s, Hart predicted that wars would become more humane and rational: World War Two was the most destructive war in history.<br />In this war, the greatest test of Britain's survival as an independent and sovereign nation, Fuller and Hart encouraged Hitler to attack the Soviet Union. Hart opposed the Allies' policy of total war against Hitler, and called for Britain to collaborate with Hitler. Hart claimed that victory was unattainable and that fighting Hitler would `only lead to mutual suicide, and the collapse of civilisation'.<br />Gat asserts that Hart pioneered a `Western way' of warfare, of limited war, containment and economic coercion, based on the reactionary dreams of European and World Federation. But there is no such `Western way': Western ruling classes waged all sorts of wars against national liberation struggles, annihilatory against Korea, Algeria and Vietnam, relatively limited against Malaya and Kenya.dreams of European and World Federation.

He is a long-time critic of the EU who works for the United Left Group in the European Parliament.<br />His brief, well-organised chapters cover the EU's treaties, institutions, enlargement, Common Foreign and Security Policy, Justice and Home Affairs, the euro, the internal market, external economic relations, employment, social policy, the environment, the Common Agricultural and Fisheries Policies, transport, and regional and industrial policy. He includes an extremely useful and up-to-date survey of information available in books, articles and websites.<br />McGiffen shows that the EU is capitalist through and through, created by employers for employers, designed to leach power away from workers. The EU is not about democratic nations cooperating for peace, but about employers railroading Europe's nations into a single undemocratic `superpower' (Blair's word).<br />Most importantly, he shows how the euro gives vast unaccountable powers to the European Central Bank, ending all democratic control over economic policy, and implementing an extreme monetarism. He shows how the euro strengthens capital's power to destroy European nations' welfare states, achieved by workers' struggles over the centuries. He cites the economist Melvyn Krauss: \\"Behind the euro's falling exchange rate is a life-and-death struggle between it and Europe's welfare state. Either the euro subverts the welfare state, or Europe's welfare state subverts the euro.\\"<br />So the welfare state is at stake in the fight against the euro, but not only the welfare state. EU monetarism installs deflation as a permanent policy, cutting down jobs and industries across Europe: the EU mortally threatens manufacturing industry, so vital for our working class's very existence as a creative, world-making force. Without industry, there can be no independent, sovereign Britain.<br />So how do we stop the EU and the euro from destroying Britain? Not by rallying the forces of `the left'. The idea of workers' nationalism alone has the huge potential of uniting all our class in the fight to save Britain. Renouncing the nation only weakens the class. As Ho Chi Minh always said, real internationalism begins at home.we stop the EU and the euro from destroying Britain? Not by rallying the forces of `the left'.

As he acknowledges, its `model does not itself work.' He points to US workers' reduced wages, long hours (averaging 50 a week), fewer holidays, and record levels of debt, to the USA's minimal welfare, regulation and taxes, an all-too flexible labour market, worse productivity than Europe's, falling investment and de-industrialisation.<br />Yet the US state tries to impose this model worldwide through the IMF, the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation, demanding balanced budgets, tight money, de-regulation, privatisation, anti-union laws and mergers. There is no need for privatisation: between 1980 and 1988, NHS hospitals increased in-patient treatment by 16%, emergency treatment by 19% and day surgery by 73%, without significant cost increases. And privatisation doesn't work: the Tube PPP promises only 12 new trains, in six years' time. The West Coast line upgrade will cost £16 million a mile, three times more than BR's upgrades; and the first 14 PFI hospitals will cost £1.3 billion, twice the original estimates. Mergers don't work either: a survey of 700 mergers showed that only 119 added value.<br />The worst part is his effort to promote the EU. Yet he realistically describes its workings: EU summits have acted `in effect to Americanise Europe'. \\"The EU has allowed itself to define its task as `liberalising' and deregulation' ... in accordance with the consensus view that there is little to be done in Europe except build a single market.\\" The EU is `developing as an engine of the conservative right' and is `trying to import the American model'. The European Central Bank has `a highly conservative monetary regime'; its `entrenchment of monetarism' is `grievously damaging the management of the European economy'.<br />Then wishful thinking takes over. He claims that the EU's high levels of long-term unemployment are just the short-term results of various shocks, not due to the ECB policy of deflation.

Vietnam genuinely defended itself against Pol Pot's attacks, which had killed 30,000 Vietnamese. Tanzania replied, claiming self-defence, to Uganda's 1978 invasion.<br />Resolution 688 of 1991, used by NATO states to justify their postwar intervention in Iraq, did not authorise the use of force to protect human rights. If it had, the Soviet Union and China would have vetoed it. Wheeler writes, \\"the longer-term benefits of the intervention remain fundamentally ambiguous.\\"<br />In Somalia, the Security Council authorised armed intervention not on humanitarian grounds, but by claiming, falsely, that `international peace and security' were threatened. In Rwanda, the French government got the UN to authorise its intervention, but its troops only rescued its clients, who had killed a million Rwandans.<br />The UN did not authorise NATO's intervention in Kosovo: Russia and China would have vetoed any such resolution. Wheeler notes, \\"there were important US security interests at stake in the Balkans\\" and judges that this was `not a good model of humanitarian intervention'.<br />In sum, Wheeler rightly asserts that claims for humanitarian intervention were not accepted in the 1970s. He argues that a new norm of UN-authorised humanitarian intervention developed in the 1990s, but, as we have seen, the UN only authorised intervention on humanitarian grounds once, in Rwanda, which discredits, not supports, the policy. As the Foreign Office admitted in 1998, \\"There is no general doctrine of humanitarian necessity in international law.\\" A fortiori, there is no new norm of unilateral humanitarian intervention: NATO's unilateral intervention in Kosovo threatened the whole international security system founded on the UN Charter.<br />Sovereignty, non-intervention and non-use of force are barriers against international, imperialist wars, so hugely destructive of human life.

A portrait of a great and humane man emerges from these pages. He addresses a remarkable variety of subjects, but always links them to their root cause, our continued tolerance of the unjust and unworkable economic disorder that is capitalism.<br /> He defends Cuba's exceptional achievements in the fields of health and education, pointing out that in Cuba life expectancy is remarkably high. He upholds Cuba's democracy as more full and just than the parliamentary democracy that we increasingly reject.<br /> He notes that more Cuban doctors and health workers are providing free medical services in Third World countries than at any previous time. They are training 5000 Latin American medical students to become doctors in Latin America. Cuban doctors have set up medical schools in Gambia and Equatorial Guinea to educate doctors to live and work in Africa, not to poach them, as the Blair government does. Cuban doctors are working to assist African countries to cope with the devastations of AIDS.<br /> War, terrorism and economic crisis are all born of an unsuccessful and unsustainable political and economic order. Fidel deplores the fact that the US government holds the sole veto power in the IMF and the World Bank, which prevents these bodies from being changed from tools of destruction. Fidel asserts that theft of resources and of capital from Third World countries equals genocide, and looking at the huge numbers of unnecessary child deaths in those countries, one can only agree.<br /> He warns against recourse to war as a solution to problems. Instead, he proposes that the UN Security Council, an executive body, should be subordinated to the democratic legislature of the General Assembly.<br /> On the Middle East crisis, he points out that in 2001 the US government vetoed a draft resolution for setting up observers to protect the Palestinian people, and Blair's representative abstained!

It argues that in adapting to their loss of family and school environment, children unconsciously construct a `Strategic Survival Personality', which become counter-productive in adult life. It offers some suggestions for reversing these effects by means of the development of self-awareness and psychotherapeutic help.\\"<br />Duffell cites evidence from memoirs, literature and case histories. On a personal note, I found, much later, that I had taught in a comprehensive school for exactly the same number of terms that I had boarded at private schools: I had exorcised the abnormal experience by giving myself a normal school experience.<br />Duffell describes the pathology produced by boarding school, which is very similar to the Stockholm syndrome of identifying with your jailer. He depicts the cruel expulsion from family life and the system's culture of denial and lying. He shows how its suppression of childhood trains its victims for the repression of the working class, of women and of foreigners, all seen as inferior, immature, emotional, incapable and ignorant. As Lord Esher said, \\"the English people are children in foreign politics.\\" These schools trained the self-righteous bullies who ran the empire, and who now want to run a would-be European empire.<br />Duffell ascribes these failings to the British as a whole, but clearly the whole British people do not go to these schools, only those being groomed for rule through the Inns of Court, the officers' messes and the Houses of Parliament. These schools reproduce the `two-nation class system'. They distort the whole education system and misuse scarce educational resources. These private enterprises, ludicrously, get the tax relief given to charities. It is as if 5% of the population were still allowed the freedom to own slaves, or could buy into private hospitals.<br />A purely psychotherapeutic approach, while clearly aiding some individuals, does not address the roots of the problem: there is little point in later reducing some of the system's dehumanising effects if we permit it to grind out these effects generation after generation.approach, while clearly aiding some individuals, does not address the roots of the problem: there is little point in later reducing some of the system's dehumanising effects if we permit it to grind out these effects generation after generation.	2004-07-06

He addresses themes - democracy and sovereignty - that our trade unions should take up. We can learn from writers on the EU like Mote, Christopher Booker and Lindsay Jenkins, though of course they could learn a lot from us in the labour movement about economic and industrial reality!<br /> Workers' patriotism and democratic self-government are not abstract notions. As Mote observes, if we lose sovereignty, we will lose our North Sea oil: the Maastricht Treaty's Preamble 8, Title 2, described our oil as a `shared resource'. (SNP please note!) Already, the Government unpatriotically backs foreign firms at the expense of British industry, as when the Ministry of Defence ordered army uniforms from a German firm.<br /> Mote asks how democratic the EU is. In the European Parliament, absentee MEPs are counted as having voted for the resolution. This practice encourages these overpaid gentlemen to do even less for their lolly. Members of Europol, the EU police force, are above the law: the Amsterdam Treaty's Article 8 makes them `immune from legal process of any kind for acts performed ... in the exercise of their official functions'. The same Treaty referred to `bringing about the legal termination of the independence, sovereignty and right to self-government for all time'.<br /> But surely we gain economically from our EU membership? Strangely, no British Government has ever done a cost/benefit analysis; however the Institute of Directors estimates that it costs us £15 billion net a year. If we chose to join the euro, it would cost us £36 billion, £650 each. The Bank of England says that then staying in the euro would cost us another £9 billion a year. As for the future, we could be lumbered with paying for the unfunded pension liabilities of EU countries: Delors said, \\"EMU means, for instance, that the EU recognises the debts of all countries in EMU.\\"<br />Interestingly, Switzerland, not a member, but trading with the EU, has Europe's lowest unemployment and highest wages.Switzerland, not a member, but trading with the EU, has Europe's lowest unemployment and highest wages.	2004-07-06

He calls for a `shift from the politics of organisation to a politics of events'. He knows that capitalism does not work, but not that socialism does. His whole book attacks the revolutionary idea that workers can change society by seizing state power. So he has to attack those ideas that workers need to do the job, the ideas of class, nation and party. He insults revolutions as `dreadful defeats' for the working class.<br /> But this is not new thinking: it is a mix of the old ideas of anarchism and `left' communism.<br /> A study of revolution should start from understanding the working class. But instead Holloway takes it for granted that he already knows what it is; but he does not, since he writes of the working class being `numerically on the decline'. In fact, the working class is growing worldwide, as peasants move into cities, and in Britain workers, whether secretaries or engineers, brain-surgeons or miners, are the vast majority of the population.<br />He denies the value of organizing nationally, preferring the series of demonstrations in Seattle, Davos, Washington and Prague. This airport anarchism changes nothing.<br />He tries to resurrect the faded ideas of the Hungarian philosopher George Lukacs, who wrote that the Party is the `bearer of the class consciousness of the proletariat'. This denies that workers are thinking beings who develop their ideas from their experience. Workers do not need leaders to tell them what to do and think. Lukacs' ideas end up in the undemocratic nonsense that working-class parties have to think and act on behalf of the working class.<br />To this way of thinking, the process (or rather the pose) is everything, the issue and the result are nothing. This windy idealism dangerously confuses the clarity on class, nation and party that we need to defeat our enemy capitalism.	2004-07-06

The authors describe how financiers and top management collaborate against the interests of industry and the wider society, and they connect the growing industrial and social destruction to \\"the age-old belief of the ruling class that money, land and property are more important than people.\\"<br />In particular, finance capital promotes mergers. Who gains from these? Investment bankers, above all: \\"What a business - fees for putting Humpty on the wall, fees for pushing him off, fees for putting him back together again\\", as John Plender noted in the Financial Times. Who loses? Financiers claim that mergers increase production and profits, but most mergers slash jobs, productivity, profitability, investment and pension funds. The Economist noted that between 1992 and 2002 mergers in Britain destroyed £80 billion worth of manufacturing assets. Between 1995 and 2000, mergers in the USA destroyed more than $1 trillion in assets. As Keynes said, \\"When the capital development of a country becomes the by-product of the activities of a casino, the job is likely to be ill done.\\"<br />As the authors write, \\"industry [is] more important than the vested interests of a privileged few\\" because industry is `the only real source of economic independence'. Britain needs high-skill, high-investment, high productivity, R&amp;D-intensive, knowledge-based industries. And, as the authors note, Britain already has `a high-quality, skilled and potentially world-class workforce'.<br />But Britain's manufacturing sector is today only 23% of the economy. It is more than 60% in France and Germany, 52% in Japan, and 30% in the USA. The most dynamic sectors of industry are the physics- and chemistry-related industries, which need long-term R&amp;D and investment. But only 10% of large British companies are in these knowledge-based industries, compared to 50% in Japan, France and Germany, and 30% in the USA. In the FTSE100 list of top firms, there are no British companies in the IT hardware, engineering and machinery, electrical engineering, and industrial manufacturing sectors.<br />What of the future? Between 1989 and 1999, R&amp;D spending by British manufacturing firms fell by 14.2%. Without industry, we would not have a real economy at all, only a jumble of temporary, privatised services, whose workers would be relatively unskilled, low-paid and low regulation, and their jobs would be low-tech, low-productivity and low-investment.<br />What then is the Blair government's industrial strategy? As the Budget showed, it has none. For example, how has it treated BAE Systems, one of Britain's last world-scale manufacturers? The government removed the proviso that BAE Systems should have majority British shareholding, then refused to back the firm, saying that it was `not British'. (Actually the Blair government is `not British', because it always acts against Britain's interests.) The threatened takeover by Boeing would lose us all control over this vital manufacturer.<br />The authors write that the current system has a \\"malign momentum ... if the current situation does not change, even greater damage will be inevitable.\\" This is accurately describing capitalism's absolute decline, which is destroying British industry. They write that the economy has been \\"hijacked by the selfish interests of an isolated, self-serving system ... controlled by networks of people who have a massive interest in keeping things broadly as they are\\", \\" a system that bestows huge benefits on a tiny minority and damages the interests of the huge majority of participants.\\" This accurately describes capitalism, which, as Keynes observed, \\"represents the most astounding belief that the most wickedest of men, doing the most wickedest of things, will be for the good of everyone.\\"<br />The authors have given us an excellent analysis: what do they advise us to do about it? They would allow the capitalist class to carry on doing what it wants. \\"We would not seek to outlaw or prevent current investment practice. In a free economy, investors, market makers and speculators should be free to behave, within reason, as their inclinations dictate.\\"<br />Yet as they admit, \\"The history of the financial markets and management shows that self-regulation just doesn't work.\\" And they vividly depict the financiers' vitriolic response to the modest Higgs proposals for changes in corporate governance. What Marx called `the furies of private interest' will also dismiss the authors' sensible proposals for reform.<br />The authors recognise that the Blair government has not `the faintest intent of seriously intervening in the system'. None of the parliamentary parties, no section of the ruling class, will act to stop the destruction that the authors describe so well. The only way to achieve the authors' aims is for the British working class to take control of where we work, to take responsibility for running the whole show, to kick out `the tiny minority ... who have a massive interest in keeping things broadly as they are'.majority of participants.\\" This accurately describes capitalism, which, as Keynes observed, \\"represents the most astounding belief that the most wickedest of men, doing the most wickedest of things, will be for the good of everyone.\\" <br />The authors have given us an excellent analysis: what do they advise us to do about it?

At the last election, the Times backed Labour as the best option for `consolidating the core aspects of Thatcherism and extending them to fresh areas of policy'. This government aims to strengthen capitalism, and continues to destroy our industry and privatise services even Thatcher did not touch.<br /> Grieve Smith proposes that the Government should change its basic policy and instead promote growth and full employment by using fiscal policy to stimulate demand. For one, this is as realistic as asking Thatcher to approve of socialism; for another, the Maastricht Treaty rules this out. As he acknowledges, \\"The whole concept of an integrated fiscal and monetary policy is vitiated by the fact that Article 7 of the Treaty specifically forbids the Council from influencing the European Central Bank in any way.\\" The EU meant the Bank to be deaf.<br /> Grieve Smith writes of `the almost completely monetarist framework for the future of European integration in the Treaty of Maastricht'. But it is not `almost completely' monetarist: it is completely monetarist. He is trying to imply that the Treaty leaves an opening for his proposals to be implemented. (Economists too often ignore policies that block their proposals.) To implement good policies, we must reject the Treaty; instead, he urges more EU integration! He opposes joining the euro, but then urges us to join a new Exchange Rate Mechanism, the EU's route into the euro.<br /> One very interesting proposal stands out - for hypothecated revenues to be earmarked to pay for certain services. This idea, combined with referenda that would enable us, not the government, to choose where our money goes, has great democratic potential.<br /> At the root of all our problems is capitalism, which cannot be made good any more than a shark can be made into a goldfish. But Grieve Smith accepts capitalism, merely proffering fantasies of reforming the IMF, the EU and the World Bank.

Of the fifteen essays, written by just six writers, all academics, Ralph Miliband, Leo Panitch, David Coates, Hilary Wainwright, Colin Leys and John Saville, eight were written before 1980.<br />They note the Labour Party leadership's failure to transform capitalism into socialism, and the Left's failure to prevent this failure. But it is wishful thinking to imagine that Labour's leaders ever had this aim in mind. Labour's whole record proves that it cannot be transformed into a party that will assist the working class to win socialism.<br />Tribune, in a 1966 editorial, wrote about the Labour leadership, \\"the whole Labour movement will support them in their efforts to establish socialism.\\" (My emphasis) This nicely expresses social democracy's central fallacy - that `they' will do it for us, that workers only have to vote.<br />The contributors claim that they are trying `to mark out a political and intellectual space between social democracy and communism'. But they have always refused to move beyond social democracy. They accept the capitalist lie, and wish, of `the disappearance of communism'. They accept the false distinction between `Old' and `New' Labour, which are the same. They are hostile to the two-class analysis of Britain and hostile to democratic centralism. In their narcissistic preoccupation with this `Milibandist' trend of thought, the contributors' egoisms reflect the egoisms of the Labour lefts, Bevan, Foot and Benn.<br />Miliband claimed in 1961 that Socialist Register needed `to begin preparing the ground for the coming into being' of an alternative to the Labour Party. OK, fine, so how's their Party doing, 42 years later? Oh ... they haven't quite got round to founding it yet. Instead, they republish old essays feebly repeating that they need `to begin preparing the ground ...

In the earlier chapters, he makes a reasonable job of telling the story truthfully, but when he reaches the 20th century, his imbecile political opinions wreck the narrative.<br />He depicts the Empire's bloody origins in piracy and theft. He shows how the British people bore the Empire's costs, how the Indian people paid for the Indian Army, while the Empire's gains accrued only to a tiny minority of bondholders, and how the export of India's riches led to the vast famines of the 18th and 19th centuries. He accurately describes the imperial slogan `Commerce and Christianity' as theft and fundamentalism.<br />He praises the Empire's `capital export to the less developed world', as if investment was about giving not taking. The investment should have been in British industry. He blames trade unions for the Great Depression - \\"Rising real wages led to unemployment\\" - unpardonable economic illiteracy from a Professor of Economics.<br />He blames World War Two on a `descent into protectionism' rather than on the continuing rivalry between empires. He writes that the USA was the key to victory - so not the ally that destroyed 90% of Nazi forces? He writes that Britain \\"sacrificed her Empire to stop the German, Japanese and Italians keeping theirs. Did not that sacrifice alone expunge all the Empire's other sins?\\" (A strangely Catholic doctrine!) But Churchill thought he had saved the Empire, only to find that the USA nipped in and stole it! And the answer to Ferguson's question is still no.<br />He sneers that anti-imperialism is linked to anti-semitism, sneers about `conspiracy theories' about oil, sneers about `freedom fighters' (his inverted commas), sneers about the Soviet and Chinese achievements.

She shows how the ruling class's propaganda agencies presented Thatcher as a heroine, taking `tough' decisions for our own good. To do this, they adopted the redtops' image of the heroic scab, alone, embattled, yet ultimately triumphant, `defiantly' standing up against his trade union.<br />Nunn shows how Thatcher's subservience to the USA was displayed as independence, how her ancient, discredited capitalist thinking was labelled new and progressive. Nunn is good on Thatcher's simplistic moralism, that all economic, political and social problems can be solved by appealing to `good people' to punish `evil-doers', that war, crime and unemployment are due to other people's immorality. But Nunn ignores how Thatcher's fabled housewifely virtues covered the deliberate destruction of industry, and how the enthronement of Thatcher, ironically, undermined many institutions of ruling class power, the EU, Parliament, the judiciary, the BBC.<br />Nunn unnecessarily uses her subject's fashionable vocabulary of psychoanalysis, which screens rather than describes reality. Like many academics, she privileges her subject: she sees propaganda as determining how people think, rather than appreciating that people's ideas come from their real-life experiences. She never asks how much Thatcher's image really affected the way people thought.<br />For Thatcherism did have a substance - of turning your back on your trade union, of denouncing (other people's) pay rises, of seeking the easy solution, of avoiding political thought and work, of siding with war and empire, of relying on `capitalism to do it for you'. Of course, that's all so different now under Labour!

But Sheffield misreads the war's origins, methods and results. Like all too many historians of this war, he lines up supporting one imperialist power against another.<br />He tries to justify the war as British self-defence, but it was a war between rival pirates, whose similarities are more important than their differences, and it doesn't matter which pirate drew the knife first. The rival historians are still quarrelling with Lenin, without honestly and openly confronting his analysis of imperialism.<br /> Sheffield describes the Somme as \\"if not a strategic victory, certainly a strategic success.\\" It's fortunate that he's a military historian at King's College London, not a general! He doesn't mention the battle's casualty figures - Britain and France lost 600,000 killed, Germany 650,000 - claiming that he is not into `the grisly process of comparing casualty statistics', although he does so for the battles of Passchendaele and Amiens. He notes, only in passing, that the British and French blockade killed 243,000 German civilians in 1918.<br />Overall, the Allies killed 3.5 million people, the Central Powers 5 million, so by Sheffield's criterion for `strategic success', the Central Powers won the war! He tries to claim that the appalling carnage was worthwhile, because it was a war for democracy. But in reality, millions were killed just so that Britain and France's ruling classes, not Germany's, should run the Middle East.<br /><br /> The First World War raises the questions  - how can wars be prevented? How can they be stopped? Not by voting Labour! The Labour Party opposed the war, until it started, and then backed it when it began - just as now. Only the working class could have prevented the war, or stopped it early, by seizing power from the warmongers. The Russian revolution ended the war: revolutions in other countries too would have prevented the Second World War.<br /> This book is not the `radical new interpretation' that the publishers promise: it is the conventional, ancient case for empire and war, in modern academic guise.d War.<br /> This book is not the `radical new interpretation' that the publishers promise: it is the conventional, ancient case for empire and war, in modern academic guise.	2004-07-05

It complements, but does not replace, Avi Shlaim's superlative, and presciently titled, book `The Iron Wall'.<br />Palestine's British rulers tried from 1918 to get the two peoples to build a British protectorate, but failed. After the British allowed a division of the unitary economic system in 1929, Jewish leaders built up an independent, privileged Zionist enclave. They mobilised the Jews by intensifying enlistment, imposing coercive taxes, preventing emigration and encouraging immigration.<br />In the 1948 war, the Zionist leaders, under the cover of a war of national liberation against the British Empire and its puppet Arab royals, expelled most Palestinians from their homes. Pappe writes of the Zionists' military Plan D's two aims: \\"the first being to take swiftly and systematically any installation, military or civilian, evacuated by the British. ... The second, and far more important objective, of the plan was to cleanse the future Jewish state of as many Palestinians as possible.\\" Atrocities carried out by Zionist forces, including the massacres at Dir Yassin and Balad al-Shaykh, forced 690,000 Palestinians to flee under threat of death.<br />Decades of partition and occupation followed. Now Israel is building yet more illegal settlements, blockading the Palestinians (causing 50% unemployment), manning an electric fence around the Gaza Strip, abusing people at checkpoints, demolishing houses, assassinating at will, conducting mass arrests, torturing detainees, and building a wall dividing the West Bank from Israel. In the last three years, Israeli forces have killed 2,750 Palestinian civilians, and Palestinian suicide bombers have killed 892 Israeli civilians.<br />The US state massively subsidises the Israeli state. Bush fully backs Sharon the career terrorist: ten days after assuming the Presidency, Bush told the National Security Council, \\"We're going to correct the imbalances of the previous administration on the Mideast conflict. We're going to tilt it back towards Israel.\\"<br />US and EU interference have inflamed, not resolved, the conflict.

Its power bases are Wall Street, the Pentagon, the CIA, the Texas-based oil business and the British alliance. Its corporatist fascism is destroying America's democratic and republican traditions.<br />CIA director Bush Senior thwarted Carter's efforts to get the US hostages out of Iran, helping to get Reagan elected. After becoming vice-president in 1981, Bush arranged the arming of the mujehadin and Saddam. Bush illegally sold arms to Iran and used the funds to back the Contra terrorists. In August 1990, Thatcher encouraged Bush's attack on Iraq: \\"George, I was about to be defeated in England when the Falkland conflict happened. I stayed in office for eight years after that.\\"<br />Leading the religious Right, Bush junior portrays America as a new Rome beset by barbarians, and Iraq as Babylon. These fundamentalists use the Bible to justify pre-emptive war (Esther 8:11); Jeremiah 50:8-20 promises that Israel will gain `from the destruction of Babylon'.<br />The Bushes look after their own: the richest 1% has doubled their share of US income since 1980. The ratio of executive pay to factory workers' pay went from 42:1 to 419:1. The USA and Britain now have the least social mobility in the developed world.<br />Texas capitalists oppose immigration control because they want cheap labour. \\"In addition to laws inimical to unions, the proven solution for keeping costs down has been Mexican laborers - either illegal immigrants or temporary guest workers ... Their presence in the Texas labor market also applied downward pressure on other wages.\\"<br />The Republican Party and the Labour Party have common policies: imperialism and warmongering, fraud and corruption, government support for religion (faith schools), a class hatred of trade unions, support for freedom of capital (which equals slavery for workers) and for offshore tax havens, a rhetoric of compassion and inclusiveness but a policy of secrecy, deceit and lies.<br />Capitalism in absolute decline generates this kind of politics: the EU and Russia are going the same way too.and inclusiveness but a policy of secrecy, deceit and lies. <br />Capitalism in absolute decline generates this kind of politics: the EU and Russia are going the same way too.	2004-06-30

It reflects the EU's social democratic approach to Cuba and socialism, basically hostile, under a veneer of friendship.<br />It is not as good as Jon Lee Anderson's biography of Che, and it unfortunately overlooks key sources like Morley, Petras, Huberman and Sweezy. Nonetheless, it vividly portrays the great revolutionary from his days as a guerrilla leader in the Sierra Maestra to the present.<br />Skierka tells the story of President Kennedy's policies towards Cuba, starting with his Bay of Pigs attack in April 1961 (with no UN authorisation - like Bush's recent attack on Iraq). That November, Kennedy approved the invasion plan Operation Mongoose. In February 1962, he ordered a total blockade of Cuba, and demanded a military strike. Then he reversed course and secretly contacted Castro, which infuriated the CIA, the Mafia and the Cuban exiles, who arranged Kennedy's assassination, and blamed Castro.<br />Contrary to Skierka's view, Cuba has every right to defend itself against its external enemies and their internal allies. Those who take foreign money to propagandise and organise betray their country. The Sandinistas in Nicaragua won liberals' plaudits by allowing the counter-revolution to organise, but the Sandinistas lost power as a result, and Nicaragua's workers and peasants lost too.<br /> Castro said, referring to Gorbachev, \\"there are two types of communists: good and bad ones, as defined by imperialism. Those who do not submit to imperialism they call inflexible.\\" Castro told Gabriel Garcia Marquez that Perestroika \\"is leading the Socialist world back to capitalism.\\" Garcia Marquez suggested, \\"perhaps it's the beginning of true socialism, of socialism with a human face.\\" Castro replied, \\"No. Believe me, Gabo, it's going to be a disaster.\\"<br />The USA and the EU pose a growing threat to Cuba, playing hard cop/soft cop, the USA with economic sanctions and ceaseless, recently intensified, terrorist attacks organised from Florida by the CIA and the Mafia, the EU with diplomatic and cultural boycotts.

For example, Montefiore describes Stalin as `a super-intelligent and gifted politician'. He shows who was to blame for the damage to agriculture when he points out that the kulaks \\"refused to sow their crops, declaring war on the regime.\\" He shows that there is no evidence for the ludicrous assertion that Stalin ordered Kirov's assassination. He refutes the Trotskyist lie that Stalin collapsed after the Nazis invaded, and he applauds Stalin's decision to stay and fight in Moscow in 1941.<br />Montefiore notes that the Warsaw rising aimed \\"not to help the Soviet advance but to forestall it.\\" As Marshal Rokossovsky said, \\"the rising would have made sense only if we were on the point of taking Warsaw. That point had not been reached ...\\"<br />Montefiore observes that Khrushchev's memoirs were `designed to blacken Stalin wherever possible', although they are still taken as gospel by the enemies of socialism.<br />But unfortunately most of the book is just abusive, sensationalist and slanderous gossip, mostly derived from memoirs and interviews. It has more in common with Martin Amis' vapid little book `Koba the dread' than with decent scholarship like Ian Grey's `Stalin: man of history', Ludo Martens' `Another view of Stalin', or Erik van Ree's `The political thought of Joseph Stalin'.<br />Montefiore writes of the huge workloads carried by Stalin and his colleagues. This belies his glib sub-title: which tsar, or courtier, ever worked 16-hour days for Russia?<br />Montefiore rubbishes the Soviet Union's unparalleled achievements - the defeat of the pro-fascist fifth column, the unification of the country, industrialisation, the collectivisation of agriculture, the provision of education, health and welfare for all, and the defeat of Nazism. (He writes, \\"Education was one of the great Bolshevik achievements\\", and then never says another word about it.)<br />As the Russians say nowadays, Stalin found the Soviet Union a wreck and left it a superpower, Gorbachev and Yeltsin found it a superpower and left it a wreck.Union a wreck and left it a superpower, Gorbachev and Yeltsin found it a superpower and left it a wreck.	2004-06-22

The authors conclude, \\"the global and European roles together are still clearly much less significant for London than its continuing role as a national centre.\\"<br />London was Britain's largest single manufacturing centre, but since 1962 it has lost 1.6 million manufacturing jobs. Its unemployment has worsened recently.<br />The authors attack Blair's approach to local government: \\"Within each local authority the proliferation of government ordained partnerships and specially focused programmes (by service, group and/or locality) is making a coordinated approach and `joined up' governance harder than ever. ... our work has tended both to cast doubts on the efficacy of local programmes, and to underline the importance of a number of mainstream policy areas. ... Labour's pursuit of `joined-up' action seems quite perversely to have brought ever more complex arrays of `initiatives' which are short-term, unsustainable, uncoordinated and even contradictory. ... area-based approaches ... have been the staple of urban policy for the past 35 years, but rarely matched their promises with sustainable achievements. ... We are sceptical, however, about what has been achieved through the proliferation of health, education and other action zones.\\"<br />Southwark, for example, has contracted out education and housing benefit administration, reducing its ability to coordinate policies. The council relies on private investment for regeneration, but most residents have not gained from the spectacular new South Bank. This kind of `regeneration' is just like the old discredited `trickle-down'.<br />The authors propose national programmes for \\"improving the supply of low- and moderate-income housing  - and conditions in the existing stock of social housing - in ways that prevent this stock from being subsequently `captured' by other groups; improving public transport provision while restricting the costs of such travel, so as to enhance particularly the mobility of disadvantaged groups; and raising performance in those state schools at the bottom of current league tables ...\\"d conditions in the existing stock of social housing - in ways that prevent this stock from being subsequently `captured' by other groups; improving public transport provision while restricting the costs of such travel, so as to enhance particularly the mobility of disadvantaged groups; and raising performance in those state schools at the bottom of current league tables ...\\"	2004-06-12

Before Sheik Abdul Rahman's group bombed the World Trade Centre in 1993, the FBI sacked its informer, the Sheik's bodyguard, because they thought that he was lying when he warned that the group was planning a bombing in New York. Subsequently, all the federal agencies failed to take seriously the risk of more such attacks.<br />After Clinton ordered the bombings in Sudan and Afghanistan in 1998, warnings poured in that Al Qa'ida would hit back by crashing planes into the World Trade Centre, the Pentagon, CIA HQ and the White House. On 6 August 2001, the CIA briefed Bush that bin Laden was determined to strike in the USA and might hijack planes to do so. Bush still refuses to release the briefing, and later released just ten pages of the Congress Joint Intelligence Committee's 450-page report on his foreknowledge and failures before 9/11.<br />Congressmen passed the Patriot Act in October 2001 before they had seen it (just like MPs with the Maastricht Treaty). The Act allowed unprecedented numbers of secret detentions, attacks on privacy and searches of homes (18,000 search warrants have been issued since 9/11). The state gave itself unchecked powers of surveillance of bank accounts, e-mails, medical records, phone calls, letters, lawyer-client discussions, and Internet, library and bookshop use.<br />All these new powers have made Americans no safer: in September 2002, two New York Daily News reporters carried box-cutters, knives and razors through eleven major airports onto 14 flights on six airlines - nobody spotted any of these banned items.<br />The book is full of accounts of abuses of power by the US state - attacks on the presumption of innocence, the right to a fair trial, the freedoms of expression and assembly, and the freedom from torture. The Patriot Act created a new crime of `domestic terrorism', defined as actions `to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion'. The new Homeland Security Department told police to keep an eye on anyone who `expressed dislike of attitudes and decisions of the US government'. Governments around the world applaud and copy these abuses.<br />Bush claims terrorism is the main threat to Americans, but just one police department, Prince George's County in Maryland, killed more Americans in the 1990s - 59 (47 shot dead plus 12 killed in police custody) - than any terrorist organisation. In the 1990s, police in the USA's 50 largest county and police departments killed more than 2,100 people.<br />Between 1991 and 2002, international terrorists killed 8,924 people worldwide; but the US-British sanctions on Iraq alone killed more than 500,000 children. The US and British governments stopped Iraq from importing $5 billions' worth of humanitarian goods, including soap, ambulances, antibiotics and medical, water treatment and sanitation equipment. Blair took no responsibility for the deaths, blamed them all on Saddam, and then used them to justify attacking the country: he said that they died \\"because of the nature of the regime under which they are [sic] living. Now, that is why we're acting.\\"<br />After 9/11, Bush first attacked Afghanistan, not terrorism, killing 5,000 civilians by bombing, rather than fighting and killing the terrorists on the ground. Consequently the leaders escaped; the USA won a battle, but not the war. Afghanistan has been abandoned: ithas not been rebuilt and has not become a democracy. It has again become the world's largest heroin producer, although suppressing its heroin production was supposedly a top US priority. In 2002, President Karzai said poppy growing would stay banned: Afghan production rose by 2000% that year.<br />Secondly, Bush backed Israel's war against the Palestinian people (witness his $9 billion aid package to Israel in early 2003). An Israeli government minister quoted Numbers chapter 33 to justify expelling all Arabs from the Occupied Territories: God commanded the Israelites, \\"Ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you\\". But the more violence the Israeli government has used, the more violence its civilians have suffered. More Israelis have been killed since Sharon became Prime Minister than in the 1967 War. And occupation corrupts: Rabbi Yaacov Perrin said, \\"One million Arabs are not worth a Jewish fingernail.\\" Israeli soldiers are under orders never to shoot at Israeli settlers, even those killing unarmed Arabs: the IDF commander in Hebron disclosed, \\"the instructions are not to shoot at Jews because Jews are not the enemy.\\"<br />Third, Bush attacked Iraq, all the while saying, `if war is forced upon us ... ' He claimed that Iraqi WMD threatened the USA, but as General Kamel said in 1995, \\"All weapons - biological, chemical, missile, nuclear - were destroyed.\\" Bovard sums up Bush's policy as `defrauding the nation to war'.<br />We need to defeat Al Qa'ida, but Bush and Blair's wars of aggression are strengthening the forces of terrorism, not weakening them.: it has not been rebuilt and has not become a democracy.

Veteran journalist James Moore vividly shows the courage and patriotism of American soldiers in battle and the heartache of the casualties' families. He contrasts this with the cold-hearted lying of those who abuse their trust. In particular, he examines the doctored military records of a certain congressman's son, who managed to evade serving in the war against Vietnam.<br />In 2000, outgoing President Clinton told George W. Bush that the terrorist threat from bin Laden was `the top priority', followed by Israel-Palestine, North Korea, India-Pakistan and Saddam Hussein. Bush replied, \\"I think you've got your priorities wrong. I'm putting Saddam at the top of the list.\\" From the first, Bush targeted Iraq, which has oil, not Al Qa'ida, which doesn't.<br />So Bush had to lie that Iraq, not Al Qa'ida, was the main threat to the American people. Fortunately for him, the US state has decades of experience of deceiving people into aggressive wars. Moore examines several of these tested techniques.<br />For example, Bush alleged that Iraq had bought aluminum tubes to help develop nuclear weapons. Here's how it works. Ignore the facts - the experts at the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory unanimously found that the tubes were not for nuclear weapons. Plant the story with a pliant journalist - in this case, Pulitzer Prize-winning Judith Miller of the New York Times. Order the intelligence and scientific communities not to dispute the administration's claims, implying that any dissent would be treated as treachery. Do a media blitz, and use the silence from the spooks and scientists as proof of the claims. Get an administration stooge - Colin Powell - to tell the lie to the UN. Get another stooge - Blair - to repeat the lie around the world.<br /> Moore also shows how the US Army censored reports from Iraq - that's what `embedded journalism' means - so Judith Miller reported what the Army told her. She got most of her WMD stories from Ahmad Chalabi, who told the same tales to the Army and the White House, which then confirmed their truth to Miller.<br />Moore recounts how, eight days after Joseph Wilson wrote that the White House `twisted intelligence to exaggerate the Iraqi threat', `senior administration officials' released his wife's identity as a CIA agent. Divulging such information is a criminal offence.<br />Using known forgeries is another technique. Although even Berlusconi's tabloid paper Panorama turned down an article based on forged documents alleging that Iraq bought uranium from Niger, Blair published the story as fact in his September 2002 dossier, and Bush used it in his State of the Union address.<br />Bush also has techniques for stealing elections: his new one, electronic touch screen voting, beats `hanging chads' and postal voting any day. Georgia was the first state to conduct an election using only electronic voting: as a result, the Republican candidate's votes rose by 16% in the four days after the last opinion poll, producing the first Republican governor of the state in 130 years. Nebraska's Republican Senator Chuck Hagel owns the firm that counted 85% of the votes in the state election that he won with 83% of the vote, the largest electoral victory in Nebraska's history.

He bases this conclusion on the ideas of the deservedly forgotten thinkers of the 1930s Frankfurt School, who, Baez thinks, somehow proved that present-day Cuba is a `decentralised bureaucratic state capitalism' run by a `new class' that exploits workers just as capitalism does.<br /> His conclusion plays into the hands of those who would isolate and destroy socialist Cuba. Why should Cuba's workers, and the workers of other nations, support a `decentralised bureaucratic state capitalism'?<br />After reaching his conclusion, he looks at the evidence. He shows that even during the 1990s, after Bush's man Yeltsin ended all Russia's contracts with Cuba, Cuba strengthened its state enterprises and increased its welfare spending. Since 1996 Cuba has achieved economic growth of 4.6% a year. It has 100% primary school enrolment (better than the USA), no homelessness, no illiteracy, and more doctors per head than any other country in the world.<br />The Cuban Medical Collaboration works in 62 countries in Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa. Since the Ernesto Che Guevara Cuban Medical Brigade arrived in Haiti in 1999, it has saved 81,856 lives. Baez acknowledges that Cuba has kept state supremacy over market forces, the unity of its political forces, popular participation, and continued commitment to the ideas of anti-imperial resistance, national sovereignty and emancipation.<br />But all these, according to Baez's theoretical model, can be achieved under (state) capitalism. If capitalism can do all this, it must be very good: who would need socialism?<br />Baez's book demeans and devalues Cuba, a socialist country that is a remarkable example both of workers' nationalism and of internationalism. We should follow Cuba's example and create a society based on national sovereignty and genuine international solidarity.ternational solidarity.	2004-04-27

She covers a huge range of topics, approaching each with a well-argued point of view. She is never neutral, but never dogmatic either.<br />On international law, she passionately upholds Britain's common law against the `fallacious ideas that a new hybrid should be created, marrying up European civil law approaches to our common law system without any thought as to the consequences'. She notes that the attack on and occupation of Iraq breached international law, and that the government sought the opinion of one of only two international lawyers who thought the attack legal.<br />Even before the 9/11 attacks, Blair imposed draconian laws against our freedoms: the Terrorism Act of 2000, for instance, reversed the burden of proof. Since 9/11, Blair has abused the attacks to limit our freedoms yet more. In December 2001, the government gave Home Secretary David Blunkett the power to detain foreign nationals indefinitely without charge or trial: as of May 2003, 13 were thus detained. This arbitrary preventive detention is no better than hostage-taking. Blunkett refused to rule out relying on intelligence obtained by torture in other countries when he decides who to detain. (Incidentally, under the Terrorism Act of 2002 it is an offence to incite or plot the overthrow of a foreign government - why does Iraq come to mind?)<br />The Criminal Justice Act of 2003 allowed people to be held without charge for interrogation for up to 14 days. Kennedy points out that state terrorism has killed more people than individual terrorism: \\"Huge attention is given to subversive terrorism, yet in fact the majority of innocent victims of indiscriminate political violence worldwide in the past forty years have been killed by state forces.\\"<br />The war in Ireland led to broken rules, miscarriages of justice, and the undermining of the whole Irish community. The same is happening with Muslims today: 500 have been arrested, but only four have been charged with a criminal offence.<br />Kennedy describes what she calls the `legal limbo' in which the US state is holding 660 prisoners of war in cruel and degrading conditions at Guantanamo Bay. But it is not a legal limbo: the US state is illegally detaining them, in ways that breach the US constitution, US law and the Geneva Conventions on prisoners of war.<br />With the EU's new Eurowarrant, a British citizen can be arrested here for actions not criminal here, on a warrant issued in any EU member country, then deported and held months in prison awaiting trial, as happens all too often in Italy, for example.<br />Kennedy believes that the government wants to restrict trial by jury because juries are independent and beyond state control. She observes that the government attacks legal aid and legal aid lawyers, that it cut benefits for lone mothers and imposed a pitifully low minimum wage, and that its vaunted family tax credits subsidise low wages.<br />The government wants to dissolve the rights of the accused, on the pretext of helping the victim. But in criminal courts, the victim is a witness for the state, so `rebalancing' in favour of the victim favours the state. She advocates keeping the double jeopardy rule and opposes the introduction of ID cards. Altering the law to make it easier to convict the guilty also makes it easier to convict the innocent.<br />On asylum and immigration, Kennedy acknowledges, \\"We are not in fact bound by treaty to admit genuine refugees if we can find them somewhere else to go, a country other than the one from which they have fled, and one where they will be treated humanely and sympathetically.\\" She opposes `sucking the talent out of developing countries for whom skilled workers are a precious resource'. But she evades the questions of how we put these ideas into practice.<br />She advocates defending judicial independence against the executive. She opposes the government's wish to let the Prime Minister have the final say in appointing judges to the highest courts.<br /> She is against charging smokers or obese people for treatment: should the NHS only be allowed to treat healthy people? The NHS's duty is to preserve life, not make moral judgements on how life is lived. This is just as true of social security: as she observes, the punitive use of benefits harks back to the Vagrancy Acts of the early 19th century.<br /> She strongly backs prisoner education, a strengthened Probation Service, and the provision of more nursery education, youth clubs, youth workers, sports pitches, gyms and voluntary parenting classes. She supports residential drug rehabilitation centres, and detoxification beds in the NHS. But as she notes, the greatest contribution to crime reduction would be full employment.<br />Kennedy proposes necessary reforms: take children under 14 out of the criminal justice system; sharpen the crimes of corporate manslaughter and conspiracy to defraud; abolish crown immunity; outlaw the use of DNA without proper consents; end the mandatory life sentence; and apply restorative justice, especially for children, where the offender has to take responsibility for, and put right, what he has done.<br />In all, this is a sparkling and hard-hitting book, which should be essential reading for all Britain's citizens.he executive.

In this absorbing book, he describes the key events before the 2003 attack on Iraq.<br />He records how containment and inspections disarmed Iraq. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported in 1997 and 1998 that it had eliminated Iraq's entire nuclear weapons programme and removed all fissionable material from Iraq. Nor could Iraq produce weapons-usable nuclear material. As Blix sums up, \\"seven years of IAEA inspection had left no significant nuclear options open.\\"<br />Iraq had destroyed any remaining chemical and biological weapons in 1991. In early 1999 a report for the Security Council concluded, \\"the bulk of Iraq's proscribed weapons programmes have been eliminated.\\" US Secretary of State Colin Powell agreed: on 24 February 2001, he said that Iraq had no `significant capability with respect to weapons of mass destruction'.<br />The UN had done what Bush and Blair wanted - disarmed Iraq so that they could then attack it for its oil. As Paul Wolfowitz, Donald Rumsfeld's deputy, said in January 2003, \\"Economically we just had no choice in Iraq. The country swims on a sea of oil.\\"<br />However, few at the UN wanted war. Blair panicked when his desperate efforts to win support for war failed: he criminally bugged UN offices, including those of Kofi Annan and Mexico, and he cynically blamed France for the war he wanted. As Robin Cook reported, Gordon Brown said on 13 March, \\"The message that must go out from this Cabinet is that we pin the blame on France for its isolated refusal to agree in the Security Council.\\" But Blair, not France, was isolated. The UN opposed the war, making it illegal.<br />Now the war against Iraq is escalating: US forces killed 600 people in Fallujah; Bush is sending 10,000 more troops; British troops are hostage to US fortunes - and all for what? The war is not for disarmament, nor against terrorism, nor for humanitarianism; it is a war for US control of Iraq's oil. For the Iraqi people, it is a war against the foreign occupier.anism; it is a war for US control of Iraq's oil. For the Iraqi people, it is a war against the foreign occupier.	2004-04-13

The book lays bare the tactics of the quislings who are more loyal to the EU than to Britain, the Tory Europhiles, for example, who split their own party to assist the more Europhile Labour Party to win the 1997 election.<br /> The EU is not about sharing or cooperation between sovereign governments. It is not inter-governmental, but supranational. The dividing line is the veto: where there are vetoes, there is inter-governmentalism; with vetoes gone, there is only a new, supranational form of government \\"beyond the control of national governments, politicians or electorates. Nation states, governments and parliaments could be left in place: but only so that they could gradually become subordinated to a new supranational government which was above them all.\\" It has been a slow-motion coup d'etat.<br />The single currency was designed to unite the new state: as the EU's founder Jean Monnet said, \\"Via money Europe could become political in five years.\\" German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said, \\"Currency, security and constitution, those are the three essential components of the sovereignty of modern nation states, and the introduction of the euro constituted the first move towards their communitarisation in the EU.\\" EU President Romano Prodi said, \\"The Single Market was the theme of the 80s; the single currency was the theme of the 90s; we must now face the difficult task of moving towards a single economy and political unity.\\"<br />How has EU membership affected Britain? Our industries have become expendable; for example, at the time of entry, a senior civil servant in the Scottish fisheries department advised ministers not to go into any detail on the damage caused to the fishing industry: \\"The more one is drawn into such explanations, the more difficult it is to avoid exposing the weaknesses of the inshore fisheries position, the only answer to which may be that in the wider context they must be regarded as expendable.\\"<br />We do not need the EU. The National Institute for Economic and Social Research found that withdrawing from the EU would not cost jobs. The Independent reported this as `8 million jobs could be lost if Britain quits EU' (18 February 2000). The NIESR's director, Dr Martin Weale, responded that the Independent's claim was \\"absurd ... pure Goebbels. In many years of academic research I cannot recall such a wilful distortion of the facts.\\" In the subsequent discussion, Gordon Brown claimed, \\"750,000 British companies export from Britain to Europe\\": the government's own figure was 18,000.<br /> The British working class's resolute hostility to the euro has defeated that EU attack.

These were overwhelmingly Marxist in origin; none were by orthodox or conservative Russian thinkers. Stalin used only Marxist sources, especially Marx and Lenin, and never referred to writers in the old Russian, Tsarist, autocratic tradition. The book shows how Stalin's thoughts and deeds were rooted in the revolutionary ideas of Marxism.<br />Stalin was a genuine and convinced Marxist, a moderniser, a Westerniser, who promoted huge advances in education, health and welfare. He accelerated industrialisation and collectivised agriculture, just as Marx and Engels had advocated. He used state centralisation, democratic centralism, to defeat feudal fragmentation and backwardness, as Marx and Engels had recommended to the Paris Commune of 1871. They supported the Commune as a dictatorship of the proletariat, not a parliamentary but a working body, executive and legislative at the same time. Stalin too always denounced the social democratic idea of a `peaceful transition to socialism' through `bourgeois parliamentarism'.<br />The Soviet revolution did destroy the old landowning and capitalist classes by collectivising agriculture and taking ownership of the country's industry. In response, those dying classes sharpened their struggle against emerging socialism in the 1930s, as Lenin had warned that they would, and they sought support both in the Party and from the enemy states surrounding the Soviet Union.<br />The idea of socialism in one country stems from the Communist Manifesto, which said that the working class of each country `must, of course, first of all settle matters with its own bourgeoisie', and also from Lenin. Ever since August 1915, Lenin defended the principle of socialism in one country, asserting that capitalism's uneven development enabled the Russian working class to start to build socialism. By 1923, he was saying that the Soviet Union could create a `complete socialist society'.<br />The book's last two chapters both focus on Stalin's idea of revolutionary patriotism, directly descended from the Jacobins of the French Revolution. Stalin defended workers' nationalism, the concept that each nation's working class had to uphold the nation's democracy, its honour and its sovereignty.ng that the Soviet Union could create a `complete socialist society'.<br />The book's last two chapters both focus on Stalin's idea of revolutionary patriotism, directly descended from the Jacobins of the French Revolution.

But in common with many recent historians, the author takes far too rosy a view of the Empire, an approach not unrelated to his consistent anti-Soviet bias.<br />Keay vividly depicts how the British, French and US states interfered in Egypt, Israel/Palestine, Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Iran and Lebanon for oil, military bases and power, always claiming the purest and most democratic of motives. But their autocratic and imperial rule betrayed those countries' aspirations for democracy and sovereignty.<br />For example, successive British governments tried to rule Iraq after World War One through a series of constitutional fictions uncannily similar to the US state's efforts today. In 1919, Arnold Wilson, Britain's Acting Civil Commissioner, set up municipal councils and (purely advisory) divisional councils. The British state preferred a Sunni oligarchy to a Shia democracy, so Wilson prevented any elections, claiming that the `premature' election of an Iraqi government with real power would be `the antithesis of democratic Government'.<br />The Iraqis objected to these anti-democratic and anti-national shenanigans and in 1920 rose in revolt: British forces killed 10,000 of them. In 1921, Britain's new High Commissioner, Sir Percy Cox, appointed a Council of Ministers and told them to ask ex-king Faysal of Syria to become Iraq's king. Cox then arranged a plebiscite asking the `better sort' of Iraqis to endorse his choice, and removed the other candidates. Under British supervision, Faysal won 96% of the votes.<br /> The British state brought not democracy, but death and destruction to Iraq. Why was it really there? The answer, in a word, was oil. Yet the Minister for War and the Colonies, Winston Churchill, told the House of Commons in December 1920, \\"The idea that HMG would have gone through all the difficulties they have gone through, faced all the expenses and burdened themselves with all the military risks and exactions in order to secure some advantage in regard to some oilfields ... is ... too absurd for acceptance.\\" It is perhaps less absurd than the notion that they would have gone to all that trouble if Iraq had no oil.<br />In 1924, the Admiralty informed Foreign Secretary Lord Curzon, \\"from a strategical point of view, the essential point is that Great Britain should control the territories on which the oilfields are situated.\\" Five weeks later, Curzon lied to The Times, \\"Oil had not the remotest connexion with my attitude, or with that of His Majesty's Government, over Mosul.\\"<br />The British state's abuse of Iraq was typical of the way the British, French and US states mistreated the peoples of the Middle East. These states continually sought to justify their interference by blaming the peoples for the region's troubles. However, as Albert Einstein told an Anglo-American Committee of Enquiry on Palestine, \\"It was the British presence that perpetuated the troubles, not, as received opinion had it, the troubles that perpetuated the need for a British presence.\\"<br />This book helps us to understand why capitalist ruling classes continually resort to empire, and why some people in the Middle East resort to terrorism, but to understand both is to condone neither.<br />Last century's imperialist interventions in the Middle East created lasting bitterness. Reruns of aggression and occupation today only worsen life for all the Middle East's peoples, adding to the bitterness and increasing the dangers of terrorism.ll the expenses and burdened themselves with all the military risks and exactions in order to secure some advantage in regard to some oilfields ... is ... too absurd for acceptance.\\" It is perhaps less absurd than the notion that they would have gone to all that trouble if Iraq had no oil.<br />In 1924, the Admiralty informed Foreign Secretary Lord Curzon, \\"from a strategical point of view, the essential point is that Great Britain should control the territories on which the oilfields are situated.\\" Five weeks later, Curzon lied to The Times, \\"Oil had not the remotest connexion with my attitude, or with that of His Majesty's Government, over Mosul.\\"<br />The British state's abuse of Iraq was typical of the way the British, French and US states mistreated the peoples of the Middle East.

To support this forcible occupation, Britain's ruling class used a network of self-serving deceptions. It believed, and wanted everybody else to believe, that the majority of Iraqis wanted British rule; that Iraqis would freely choose a pro-British government rather than a pro-Iraqi government; that it could divide Iraq into `good' countryside and `bad' city, `good' Kurds and `bad' Sunnis and Shia; that its desire to rule Iraq was selfless, nothing to do with the Empire's demands for Iraq's oil and for airbases; that the continuing violence and unrest were legacies from the Ottoman Empire, not responses to being occupied; and that withdrawal would lead to anarchy.<br /> The forms of the Empire's control shifted from annexation, to League of Nations mandate, to a treaty of alliance, to an advisory role, and finally to disengagement. But the British people were not fooled by the propaganda or by the shifting constitutional arrangements. Dodge writes of `the long-running public hostility of British public opinion towards maintaining an interest in Iraq'. This anti-imperialism helped Labour to win the 1929 general election, but Labour in government failed to do what the nation wanted - withdraw immediately from Iraq.<br /><br />Now Blair seems to want to repeat the dismal, costly and futile cycle. He follows Bush in rejecting the Iraqi people's demand for rule by Iraqis who win democratic elections. He denies the power and validity of nationalism, a nation's legitimate, democratic desire for sovereignty and self-determination. The people of Iraq have already defeated the Pentagon's effort to rule Iraq directly, and General Garner has been sacked. The Iraqi people have vetoed the State Department's effort to rule by courtesy of the returning exiles, and they have overturned Bush's proposal of rule by US-selected caucuses.<br />Since 1990, US and British governments have forcibly occupied one country after another. But, as Dodge sums up, \\"Post-Cold War military interventions into failed or rogue states with the overt aim of reforming their political systems ... have been uniformly unsuccessful.\\" These interventions all failed because intervening is wrong. The effort to run another country is not noble and selfless; it is immoral because it is undemocratic and anti-national, and it is bound to fail. Blair damns nationalism as old-fashioned and reactionary, but what could be more reactionary than waging an illegal war of aggression then trying to rerun the Empire?<br />Only the people of a country can rebuild it.

In particular, it shows how the US's rulers adopted Saddam Hussein, used him for more than 30 years, and then turned against him when he disobeyed them.<br />Ahmed cites the American state propagandist Samuel Huntington, \\"Muslims ... fight non-Muslims far more often than do peoples of other civilisations.\\" Huntington could note how many wars the US state has waged against `non-Americans' - 74 since 1945.<br />The USA's precursor empire, Britain, claimed that in the Middle East it was fighting \\"to defend the area against the brand of Arab nationalism\\", that is, against its people! Similarly now, the occupying forces in Iraq claim to be defending the country - against its people!<br />For nearly 30 years, Saddam Hussein was one of the CIA's men in the Middle East, an obedient dictator. The CIA helped Hussein in the 1963 and 1968 coups, giving him lists of trade unionists to be killed (5000 in 1963 alone).<br />In 1980 Iraq attacked Iran, after the US government had given Iraq the green light to invade. There were no frantic US-British efforts at the UN to denounce Iraqi aggression! In 1982, the US government took Iraq off its list of terrorist states. Later, after Iraq had used US-supplied chemical weapons, the US government increased its licensing of dual-use technology exports to Iraq.<br />In 1990, Thatcher and Reagan encouraged Kuwait not to negotiate with Iraq. Then the US government assured Iraq of its neutrality, while planning its attack. The US government told us that Iraq was threatening Saudi Arabia - but commercial satellite pictures showed no Iraqi troops on the border. The Pentagon's photos, which it said proved that the troops were there, remain classified.<br />As for the sanctions against Iraq, the US government knew from the start that sanctions would `fully degrade' Iraq's water treatment facilities. In 1999, the ethical Blair government prevented the shipment of vaccines to Iraqi children. \\"Iraqis will pay the price while he [Saddam] remains in power\\" said the US Deputy National Security Adviser Robert Gates.

He examines and refutes the simple, capitalist explanation for China's high rate of growth, that Mao's death in 1976 ended socialism, unleashing the productive powers of capitalism.<br />Bramall argues that a combination of state-led industrial policy and the favourable infrastructural legacies of the socialist era produced China's growth. He shows that industrialisation was the key source of growth, and that foreign trade and foreign investment were less important than usually thought.<br />He reminds us of the great achievements of the Chinese people under socialism - the spreading of industry, the tripling, between 1952 and 1978, of the area of China that was irrigated, the consistently high investment in the countryside, the development of a transport network, and the great improvements in health and education. He notes that in the 1950s and 1960s China was forced to adopt a strategy of defensive industrialisation in the face of threats from both the USA and the USSR.<br />In his general discussion of the conditions of economic growth, he shows that, \\"contra Nairn, Anderson, and others, the British problem is capitalism itself, not the persistence of pre-capitalist structures and institutions.\\" Capitalist rapacity has always held back manufacturing industry, and is now destroying it. Britain is too capitalist, not too feudal. The `left', like Thatcher and the European Union, attack the wrong targets - the Constitution, the monarchy, the House of Lords, the landed gentry.<br />Bramall shows that, in general, inequalities of property and wealth are the real obstacle to growth and improved living standards. The owners of capital, the ruling class, block economic progress. He concludes, \\"A radical and effective land reform coupled with an assault on private industrial capital are necessary preconditions for the implementation of successful state intervention in a developing country\\" - not only in developing countries! To achieve these goals, \\"for most countries, there is probably no alternative but the seizure of power by armed struggle.\\"conditions for the implementation of successful state intervention in a developing country\\" - not only in developing countries!

Yet the book also reveals the very defective politics of the anti-war movement, which prevented it from stopping this war, and will prevent it from stopping future wars.<br />How can we stop wars? The answer is not more of the same, not a stronger anti-war movement with ever-bigger marches, more direct action, anti-war electoral actions and better campaigning. All these we did earlier this year, to the utmost extent, and if they were the answer, there would have been no war.<br />The answer is something different and new and much more difficult: we have to cut out the root of all wars, capitalism. Without we do this, nothing that we do will stop wars, just as we cannot prevent cholera without stopping filthy water. Only the working class in power will do the job.<br />The US/British war against Iraq was illegal, immoral, unnecessary and anti-democratic. The UN opposed it. The attack killed 10,000 Iraqi civilians. Iraq was not a threat: it had no WMD. Bush and Blair wanted the war, overriding their peoples' wishes.<br />Yet after detailing Blair's ceaseless warmongering, Rai somersaults to defend him, writing that Blair \\"was most reluctant to go to war with Iraq.\\" Why? Because to Rai, social democrat Blair must be better than Republican Bush, when in fact they are the same.<br /> Rai compares postwar Iraq to 1945, when the USA and Britain forcibly crushed resistance in Italy and Greece and restored reactionary regimes throughout much of the world. True - but Rai goes on to write that the Soviet Union serviced and cooperated with this postwar reaction. Actually, the Soviet Union, wherever it could, aided the resistance and defeated US-British schemes to restore reactionary regimes.<br />The 2003 war was for Iraqi compliance and oil, not for Iraqi freedom and democracy. In Iraq, the USA has cancelled local elections, as in Najaf, and will postpone national elections indefinitely, as it did in Vietnam in the 1950s, because popular forces would win.<br />Now the people of Iraq must rebuild their country, not foreign troops or humanitarian agencies or the UN.

An IAEA spokesman said, \\"There's never been a report like that issued from this agency.\\" It had actually said that it \\"has found no indication of Iraq having achieved the program goal of producing nuclear weapons or of Iraq having retained a physical capability for the production of weapon-useable nuclear material or having clandestinely obtained such material.\\" This did not stop Bush's spokesman Anthony Blair from repeating the lie. The authors also remind us that, in February, MI6 stated that there were no links whatever between Iraq and Al-Qa'ida, contradicting the other big Labour/Republican lie.<br /> These, and the many other examples that the authors cite, raise the question, what did the working class do about the Labour government's warmongering? In particular, Labour Party members should be asking themselves whether they are complicit in the war crimes of their chosen leader.<br />Before the war, we all knew that Blair was flying the globe, lying for war. What did Labour Party members do? Then their Parliamentary Party voted for war. Did any members act to stop him, even if only by resigning from the party?<br />Without the continuing support of his party, Blair could not have taken us to war, against the wishes of the majority of the British people.<br />At the Labour Party Conference some members feebly tried, months after it would have made any difference, to soothe their guilty consciences by debating the war that they allowed, trying to weasel out of their responsibility for the war that they made possible. Deprived even of this token vote, did they resign? No, the Conference, disgracefully, gave warmonger Blair a 2-minute standing ovation before he spoke, 58 rounds of applause during his speech, and a 7 minute 35 second standing ovation at the end.<br />Thanks to excellent books like this, no generation has ever been better informed about the wars that we let our rulers wage - but this only increases our responsibility. The United States Committee for a Free Lebanon, staffed by members of the US ruling class, urges `overwhelming, non-surgical, nonproportional military force' against Sudan, Libya, Iran and Syria. And what if Bush attacks Cuba? What do we plan to do to stop future wars?<br />Earlier this year, our rulers allowed us to march, meet, petition and play electoral and parliamentary games; we won all the arguments, we won in the opinion polls, but then the rulers attacked Iraq anyway, as if we did not matter. Why did all our efforts make no difference whatsoever?<br />Because these kinds of activities are all based on the delusion that we live in some sort of democracy. Blair's war against Iraq, waged against our wishes, is the proof that we the people do not rule here yet.<br />Our capitalist class rulers will make wars till we take away their power to do so.

In 1961, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff \\"proposed launching a secret and bloody war of terrorism against their own country in order to trick the American public into supporting an ill-conceived war they intended to launch against Cuba. Codenamed Operation Northwoods, the plan, which had the written approval of the Chairman and every member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called for innocent people to be shot on American streets; for boats carrying refugees fleeing Cuba to be sunk on the high seas; for a wave of violent terrorism to be launched in Washington, D.C., Miami, and elsewhere. People would be framed for bombings they did not commit; planes would be hijacked. Using phony evidence, all of it would be blamed on Castro.\\"<br />The Joint Chiefs of Staff `Top Secret Document' of 12 March 1962, entitled `Pretexts to justify US military intervention in Cuba', stated, \\"We could blow up a US ship in Guantanamo Bay and blame Cuba, ... casualty lists in US newspapers would cause a helpful wave of national indignation. ... We could develop a Communist Cuban terrorist campaign in the Miami area, in other Florida cities and even in Washington. The terror campaign could be pointed at Cuban refugees seeking haven in the United States. ... We could sink a boatload of Cubans en route to Florida (real or simulated). ... We could foster attempts on lives of Cuban refugees in the United States even to the extent of wounding in instances to be widely publicized. ... Exploding a few plastic bombs in carefully chosen spots, the arrest of Cuban agents and the release of prepared documents substantiating Cuban involvement also would be helpful ...<br />Advantage can be taken of the sensitivity of the Dominican Air Force to intruders within their national air space. `Cuban' B-26 or C-46 type aircraft could make cane-burning raids at night. Soviet Bloc incendiaries could be found. This could be coupled with `Cuban' messages to the Communist underground in the Dominican Republic and `Cuban' shipments of arms which would be found, or intercepted, on the beach. Use of MiG type aircraft by U.S. pilots could provide additional provocation. ... Hijacking attempts against civil air and surface craft could appear to continue as harassing measures condoned by the Government of Cuba.\\"<br />In 1963, the Office of the Secretary of State for Defense produced a  `Top Secret/Sensitive' policy paper, `War between Cuba and another Latin American state'. \\"A contrived `Cuban' attack on an OAS member could be set up and the attacked state could be urged to take measures of self-defense and request assistance from the U.S. and OAS; the U.S. could almost certainly obtain the necessary two-thirds support among OAS members for collective action against Cuba.\\" Bamford writes, \\"Among the nations they suggested that the United States secretly attack were Jamaica and Trinidad-Tobago. Both were members of the British Commonwealth; thus, by secretly attacking them and then falsely blaming Cuba, the United States could lure England into the war against Castro.\\"<br />This paper proposed \\"to bribe one of Castro's subordinate commanders to initiate an attack on Guantanamo.\\" As Bamford comments, \\"the act suggested - bribing a foreign nation to launch a violent attack on an American military installation - was treason.\\"<br />Bamford sums up, \\"in light of the Operation Northwoods documents, it is clear that deceiving the public and trumping up wars for Americans to fight and die in was standard, approved policy at the highest levels of the Pentagon. In fact, the Gulf of Tonkin seems right out of the Operation Northwoods playbook ... \\"<br />Is Bush dusting off these plans? Would Blair back a US attack on Cuba?

He notes that Jack Straw says that all 75 million new EU citizens from Eastern Europe can work in Britain from January. As unemployment there averages 16%, and wages are 12% of ours, many may accept his generous invitation!<br /><br />But Britain is already overcrowded, especially in the South East. Our 60 million people are 641 to a square mile, compared with 269 in France and 76 in the USA.<br />By the Single European Act, signed by Thatcher, Britain had to end its border controls with the EU. We have now been accepting about 250,000 immigrants a year since 1997, yet are not short of labour: we have four million unemployed. Dependence on immigration deters education, depresses wages, and aids the employer.<br /> The Civitas report, Do we need mass immigration?, observed, \\"Current immigration increases inequalities in the UK, because it causes a massive redistribution of wealth from those who compete with immigrants in the labour market - who tend to be poor, and suffer low wages - to those who employ them who tend to be `rich'.\\"<br />As an AEU representative said in 1947 of similar debates, \\"We resent also the decisions made in our name and without our agreement on `displaced persons', and we reject the philosophy that if a job is so badly paid that no British worker will work at it, then the only alternative is foreign labour. We must fight for improved conditions in these industries.\\"<br />The UN High Commission for Refugees noted in 2002 that more asylum seekers tried for Britain than for any other country in the Western world. Australia halved the number of applicants by denying entry to all without the right documents, deporting unauthorised arrivals and offering cash incentives to those willing to return home. We could do the same.<br />For many good reasons then, the majority of British people oppose mass immigration. Yet some sneer `racialist' at anyone proposing immigration controls. But, as Mote shows, uncontrolled immigration harms other countries by robbing them of their labour power, and harms Britain by worsening our conditions.hows, uncontrolled immigration harms other countries by robbing them of their labour power, and harms Britain by worsening our conditions.	2003-07-15

Newman reveals the earth-shaking insignificance of the New Left's disputes at dinner-parties and seminars.<br />Not surprisingly, a New Left composed of egos like Miliband, E. P. Thompson and Tony Benn (who wrote in his 1985 Diary, \\"I'm always thrusting myself forward for publicity\\") could never work together. These `critical' intellectuals only agreed in seeing themselves as superior to the `ignorant' workers.<br />Newman tells us that by the mid-1960s Miliband had `come to the belief that a new Socialist Party would eventually need to be established ...\\" And he did as much as helping in `preparing the ground for the coming into being of a new party'! But did the New Left ever manage to found this new party?<br />In fact the New Left, just like the old left, adopted the tried and failed Fabian tactic of permeating the Labour party. The famed `independent Marxism' ended up as a marginal colony of social democracy.<br />At history's turning points, the New Left always supported the US government: it was for the CIA-backed counter-revolution in Hungary in 1956, against Vietnam's liberation of Cambodia from Pol Pot, and against the Soviet assistance to Afghanistan's only progressive government ever, which gave women equal rights and land to the peasants. At these crucial times, the New Left took the enemy's side, then moaned that the `left' was divided. It was always divorced from the working class, from the trade unions, from reality.<br />The New Left constantly whinged about the `left's disarray'. But what did its fragments all have in common? They rejected Leninist democratic centralism, by dishonestly caricaturing it as oppressive! In democratic centralist parties, the minority carries out the decisions of the majority, whereas the New Left always wanted minority rights, its rights, to trump the majority. Marxism without Leninism is playing without winning.<br />The New Left's endless projects for renewal, unification, realignment, and saving the Labour party, are all part of the confusion of thought that alone has held back the British working class for so long.stly caricaturing it as oppressive!

The German, Austro-Hungarian, Russian and Ottoman empires had all been overthrown, and delegates from thirty countries met for six months to agree Treaties supposed to bring peace and stability. But only the British, French, US and Italian governments took the decisions.<br />Did the `Big Four' achieve peace? After `the war to end war', this was a peace to end peace. They irritated, but did not corral, Germany. They encouraged Greece to attack Turkey, disastrously. They opposed self-determination for the peoples of Asia, Africa and the Middle East.<br />They backed Winston Churchill's counter-revolutionary attack on Russia. As he boasted, \\"they shot Soviet Russians at sight. They stood as invaders on Russian soil. They armed the enemies of the Soviet Government. They blockaded its ports and sunk its battleships. They earnestly desired and schemed its downfall.\\" Spurred by class hatred, Churchill was the most vicious enemy of the Russian people. MacMillan, to her shame, writes, \\"With hindsight, Churchill and Foch were right about the Bolsheviks.\\"<br />Further, the Conference let Britain and France divide the Middle East into occupied mandates, `telling the Moslem what he ought to think', as Balfour said. MacMillan quotes Lloyd George, \\"Mesopotamia ... yes ... oil ... we must have Mesopotamia; Palestine ... yes ... the Holy Land ... Zionism ... we must have Palestine; Syria ... h'm ... what is there in Syria? Let the French have that.\\"<br />MacMillan likens the end of the First World War to the counter-revolutions of 1989-90: \\"there was the same sense of a new order emerging.\\" But the end of the Soviet Union did not bring peace, quite the opposite: it ended the post-1945 peace settlement and ushered in a period of wars, from Yugoslavia to Chechnya to Iraq. Her own account shows that the 1919 Conference did not bring a new order, ending war.<br />This is fashionable history seen through the prism of personalities, the `great man' approach to history, yielding trite judgements favouring the capitalist powers.

She disposes of the well-travelled lie that Picasso admitted that his work was all a blague, a trick played on the public. In fact, as she shows, the alleged conversation was drawn from Il Libro Nero, a collection of fictitious interviews written by Giovanni Papini.<br />Utley shows how `a strategy elaborated at the highest levels of the American government' presented the art of the New York School as a living manifestation of democracy as opposed to communism. The US state promoted Abstract Expressionism, to make New York supersede Paris as the capital of Western art. It promoted the notion of the Nietzschean artist, the individualistic, introspective genius in his ivory tower, free from all social and political concerns, casting Picasso as the `anti-artist', compromised because committed.<br />Yet this is a deeply anti-communist account of a good communist. Utley sneers at what she calls the communists' `illusory goal of bridging the gap between art and the people', and at `the inadequacies of the artistic policies and aspirations of the French Communist party'. It is clearly beyond the comprehension of the author, an American academic based at New York University, that Picasso was a loyal and active Party member for the rest of his long life - which says more about the author's limits than the subject's!<br />Her stale caricature of `repressive Party' and `servile member' fails completely to explain how people of the calibre of Picasso and his friends Paul Robeson, Pablo Neruda, Louis Aragon and Paul Eluard could be Party members.

Britain, the US and the Vietnam War	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Superb account of British support for US aggression	In this brilliantly-researched study, Peter Busch examines the Conservative government's policy towards the US war against Vietnam for the years 1961 to 1963.  The author, who formerly worked at the Public Record Office at Kew, has thoroughly mined newly available records from Britain, the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Germany. He also shows how British policy towards Vietnam related to wider policy towards South-East Asia, especially towards Indonesia. In both cases, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan ruled out negotiated settlements and preferred to use force.<br />Busch shows how Macmillan fully backed President Kennedy's aggressive military build-up in Vietnam, `a clear breach' of the Geneva agreements, while advising him to conceal it. Macmillan pretended to be a peacemaker, while actually supporting the US war. He aimed to keep Britain's `great power' status and prove its value as a US ally.<br />As co-chairman of the International Control Commission set up by the 1954 Geneva Conference, the British state abused its role in order to support the illegal, dictatorial Diem regime in the south. It backed up Diem's unwarranted claims that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was responsible, `whether there was evidence or not', for starting the civil war in the south. It used these claims to rule out the DRV's call for reconvening the Conference to negotiate the peaceful reunification of Vietnam.<br />Macmillan helped the US counter-insurgency effort, setting up the British Advisory Mission in 1961. British forces also trained Diem's troops in Malaysia. In 1962, the British Ambassador to Saigon urged the USA to `crush and eradicate the Viet Cong'.<br />The British government only dropped Diem when it discovered that his brother, Ngo Dinh Nhu, was willing to discuss peace with the DRV. It then backed the US coup against Diem that sabotaged the chances of peacefully reunifying Vietnam.<br />Busch concludes that the British government did not pursue peace. \\"Britain supported the American policy in Vietnam wholeheartedly. The British only wanted to `sell' this policy in a different, less confrontational way.\\" Plus ca change! This superb book vindicates all those who opposed the US aggression against Vietnam.itain supported the American policy in Vietnam wholeheartedly.

They show that the US government is not seeking democracy or reforms in Cuba: its sole aim is to destroy Cuba's social, political and economic order.<br />Clinton was even more anti-Cuba than Bush Senior. Clinton signed the notorious Helms-Burton Bill, which illegally imposed the US's embargo on the whole world. At the UN, only the USA and Israel oppose resolutions calling on the USA to end the embargo.<br />Since 1994, the State Department's annual studies of `Patterns of Global Terrorism' have found no evidence of Cuban `sponsorship' of terrorist activities. Yet the US government lists Cuba as a `terrorist state', but not Afghanistan when it was under the Taliban! Cuba denounced 9/11 as an `atrocious and insane terrorist act', and offered to cooperate in the global war on terrorism. Bush rejected the offer.<br />Cuba has every right to act decisively to deter terrorists who hijack planes, bomb hotels and fly over Havana. Those who criticise its actions on `human rights' grounds assist the terrorists. The US government funds and supports these anti-Cuba terrorists. In 1999, the Clinton administration passed the Cuban Internal Opposition Assistance Act, providing extra money for `dissidents'. The US state funds the Cuban American National Foundation, the European Coalition for Human Rights in Cuba, and the Cuban Dissidents Task Force. Of course, `dissidents' is too polite a term for those who consciously act as paid agents of a hostile foreign power. In 1994, the State Department could find that there were only six alleged political prisoners in Cuba, somewhat fewer than in the USA.<br />Senator Helms and his cronies allege that Cuba trafficks in drugs, yet the USA's own Drug Enforcement Agency, after repeated investigations, has reported that there is no evidence of Cuban involvement in drug smuggling, and that Cuba has been singularly cooperative in working with the US Coast Guard to prevent drug smuggling. The annual State Department reports on drugs control have never listed Cuba as a major drug transit country.Cuba has been singularly cooperative in working with the US Coast Guard to prevent drug smuggling.

In this fascinating book, he studies the art of wartime leadership by examining Lincoln in the American Civil War, Clemenceau in World War One, Churchill in World War Two, and Ben-Gurion in Israels war of independence.<br /> Cohen relates how Lincoln rightly dismissed Major John Key from the Union army for private remarks about the Unions strategy that conflicted with agreed Union policy.<br />Cohen shows how all military matters are linked to wider political issues, how for instance a dispute in 1918 over whether to integrate American divisions or even regiments into larger French units had vast ramifications: as he sums up, a seemingly tactical or even technical issue was fraught with the largest implications for French national morale, manpower policy, strategy, and alliance relations.<br /> Cohen over-praises Churchills strategic abilities. Churchills imperialism led him into the disastrous foray into Greece in 1941, into underestimating Japanese military and naval abilities, also in 1941, and into diversionary adventures in North Africa in 1942, Italy in 1943, and Greece in 1944. His anti-communism led him to refuse to open the Second Front, as he had promised, in 1942 and 1943, and to his stingy attitude to supplying the Soviet Union. Yet Cohen calls him the greatest war statesman of the century. Perhaps if Cohen had also studied the leadership of the country whose forces alone shattered more than 200 Nazi divisions - more than three quarters of Hitlers army - he might have found a greater!<br /> A chapter on leadership without genius covers US wars since Korea - Vietnam, the Gulf War, Somalia and Serbia - a period in which the United States finds itself chronically resorting to the use of force, as Cohen quaintly puts it.<br /> He sums up that leaders need to listen, to be fertile and resourceful in act and speech, and must see things as they are, without illusions.

An Executive Order signed by Bush authorised secret military tribunals to try suspected terrorists: US citizens can be arrested and held without charge, without access to a lawyer, without trial and without limit. The Attorney-General says that those who oppose these tribunals are aiding the terrorists: dissent equals treason and terrorism!<br /> Capitalism ... has discovered a fatal cancer in its guts. Deregulation allowed asset-stripping (theft), as at Enron. There is much evidence of Bush and Cheney doing the same. As Pitt writes, the pirates have seized this ship of state, and have two of their own at the helm.<br /> The core of the book is a riveting account of the provenance of 9/11. From January 2001 to August, Bush held talks with the Taliban government in Afghanistan to get them to agree to Unocals proposed pipeline from Turkmenistan through Afghanistan to Pakistan. The Taliban rejected the deal. The Bush administration then threatened them with war, while watering down anti-terrorism measures. Before 9/11, Israel, Russia, Egypt, France and Germany had all specifically warned US security agencies of imminent terrorist attacks using hijacked airplanes against US landmarks. The Bush administration did not pass these warnings on to airport security agencies. When this was revealed, Bush responded that he did not order heightened airplane security because it would have cut industry profits!<br />Stanley Hilton, a former aide to Republican Senator Bob Dole, charges that Bush allowed 9/11 to happen on purpose, so that he could make political gains from the tragedy. Bush has consistently refused to allow a public inquiry into the events surrounding 9/11, and last November he signed an Executive Order sealing all presidential documentation. After 9/11, US forces replaced the Taliban with a government friendly to the USA and its oil interests: Afghanistan is now, nominally, run by Unocals man on the spot.<br />Saudi Arabia is the USAs key ally in the Middle East, supplier of most of the USAs oil and of 80% of Al Qaidas recruits, and chief funder and sponsor of Al Qaida. Yet Cuba is part of Bushs Axis of Evil, and Saudi Arabia is not! The CIA did not investigate the roots of Al Qaida terrorism in Saudi Arabia because this could have harmed US oil companies interests. As John ONeill, Deputy Director of the FBI before he resigned in protest, said,  The main obstacles to investigating Islamic terrorism were US oil corporate interests, and the role played by Saudi Arabia in it. (Incidentally, George Bush Senior is on the advisory board of the Carlyle Group, a huge multinational heavily involved in the oil business.) Pitt writes, a blind spot developed in our anti-terrorism preparations out of deference to these business interests. The USA has now withdrawn its troops from the very country where it should be focusing its war on terror.<br /> On 16 May 2002, the Boston Globe revealed that the CIA had warned Bush months before 9/11 that Al Qaida planned to hijack planes. Four days later, on 20 May, the government issued warnings of more terrorist threats: Donald Rumsfeld, for example, said that terrorists would definitely use nuclear or biological weapons in the USA.

Yet Cuba is part of Bushs Axis of Evil, and Saudi Arabia is not! The CIA did not investigate the roots of Al Qaida terrorism in Saudi Arabia because this could have harmed US oil companies interests. As John ONeill, Deputy Director of the FBI before he resigned in protest, said,  The main obstacles to investigating Islamic terrorism were US oil corporate interests, and the role played by Saudi Arabia in it. (Incidentally, George Bush Senior is on the advisory board of the Carlyle Group, a huge multinational heavily involved in the oil business.) Pitt writes, a blind spot developed in our anti-terrorism preparations out of deference to these business interests. The USA has now withdrawn its troops from the very country where it should be focusing its war on terror. <br /> On 16 May 2002, the Boston Globe revealed that the CIA had warned Bush months before 9/11 that Al Qaida planned to hijack planes. Four days later, on 20 May, the government issued warnings of more terrorist threats: Donald Rumsfeld, for example, said that terrorists would definitely use nuclear or biological weapons in the USA.

It raises many of the questions facing workers today - industrial decline, unemployment, the relationships of work and politics, and of class and party, the treachery of social democracy. However, Worley never raises the question of who was in the working class. Was it just industrial workers? What of the white-collar workers, who were increasingly joining trade unions?<br />After World War One, unemployment and the destruction of industry, due to the increasing rapidity of capitalism's decline, damaged the working class. By 1933, 61% of Party members were unemployed, and only 10% were in trade unions, so the Party failed to focus on work in the trade unions and never created a correct trade union policy.<br />Instead, it created separate rank-and-file organisations, like the National Minority Movement, and followed for too long the Profintern folly of splitting the working class through creating red unions, as opposed to `reformist unions'. It wrongly supported `industrial unions', one union for each industry. It launched `merciless' attacks on trade union `bureaucracy'. It did not focus on working with every worker at the workplace, and tended to denounce fellow-workers who did not do as the Party told them. Trotskyists denounce the `New Line', while repeating these mistakes.<br />The Party urged entering the Labour Party, as if the only place to talk with workers was a Labour Party meeting. It urged workers to vote for the Labour Party, and wasted huge amounts of time and effort working for Labour and Party candidates in elections.<br />The Party ran party training schools, which were separate from branches, adding to the endemic Party split between thinkers and doers. It needed to have education within its branches, in order to maintain itself as an independent, revolutionary party in a non-revolutionary time. Without this grounding in education, it was prone to illusions. For example, in 1927, it consistently hailed workers' `movement to the left', and called for a General Strike against the Trade Union Bill.

The special forces operated in the British and French empires, or in countries where progressive forces had taken power. The special forces waged counter-revolutionary, aggressive wars, supporting empires and capitalism, against national liberation struggles.<br />Harclerode gives detailed accounts of wars in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states 1947-56, Albania 1949-54, Indochina 1950-54, Malaya 1948-58, Korea 1950-53, Algeria 1954-62, Borneo 1962-66, Tibet 1956-74, Oman 1958-76, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos 1954-71, and Afghanistan 1979-2001. He omits the CIA operations in Hungary, Angola, Kenya, Jamaica, Cuba and Nicaragua.<br />The CIA and MI6 operated in Eastern Europe, the SAS in the Empire. Frances Action Service operated in Frances empire in Indochina and Algeria. The CIA fought the USAs secret war in Tibet, which has always been part of China. A CIA unit, the Saigon Military Mission, organised terrorism in Vietnam and Laos, breaking the Geneva Accords.<br />The CIA and MI6 started funding, arming and training terrorists to attack the progressive government in Afghanistan six months before the Soviet Union sent forces to defend the government. These terrorists later went to the USA, Algeria, Bosnia and Chechnya.<br /> The US and British states consistently built up terrorists like bin Laden, to fight national liberation struggles led by people like Ho Chi Minh. But the terrorists, like the special forces, were expendable. As the US Director of Central Intelligence, Admiral Turner, said, it was permissible to use other peoples lives for the geopolitical interests of the US.<br />A great revolutionary wrote, To die for the people in weightier than Mount Tai, but to work for the fascists and for the exploiters and oppressors is lighter than a feather.US Director of Central Intelligence, Admiral Turner, said, it was permissible to use other peoples lives for the geopolitical interests of the US. <br />A great revolutionary wrote, To die for the people in weightier than Mount Tai, but to work for the fascists and for the exploiters and oppressors is lighter than a feather.	2003-05-08

It is based on huge research in private papers and secondary sources.<br />It is in six parts: conquests 43-1100, disputed lands 1110-1603, civil wars 1637-1800, overseas wars 1660-1870, total war 1914-1919, and the people's wars 1919-2000. He constantly notes the forces' pay and conditions, and tells us how the fighting and killing must have felt.<br />Part I depicts the conquests by Romans, Vikings and Danes. Part II tells of the wars against Ireland, Wales and Scotland that determined Britain's shape. The hundred years' war against France (1337-1453) started with the early victory of Crecy, then slowly collapsed into military debacles abroad and spiralling debt and taxes at home. At this time, chivalric tales glamorised war, setting up the lasting themes of crusade and sacrifice, `Church and King', `king and country', and `natural leaders' (public school prefect types) `rallying the ranks'.<br />In Part III, James includes under `civil wars' the American War of Independence and Ireland's 1798 rebellion, which were really national liberation wars against colonial oppression.<br />In Part IV, he tells us about the vast wars for empire: the second hundred years' war against France (1688-1815), the wars to seize and control India (1757-1858) and its North West frontier (1897-1924), the 64 years war to control China (1840-1904) and the South African (1879-1902) and North African wars (1882-1898). These cast some doubt on the slogan `Pax Britannica'.<br />Part V looks at World War One, where James damns Earl Haig's reliance on attrition and `fighting spirit'. Part VI examines World War Two and the many bloody retreats from Empire.<br />To finish he asks, `What next?', answering `further wars of intervention' and `the wonders of the electronic battlefield'.<br />This brilliantly written and deeply researched account proves, possibly against the author's intentions, that capitalism means empire and empire means war. The ruling class alone gains from capitalism, empire and war. Our working class is not a warrior race, a nation of Ghurkhas; we are for industry and peace.earched account proves, possibly against the author's intentions, that capitalism means empire and empire means war.

The IMF made Tanzania charge for hospital appointments, cutting patient numbers by 53%, and charge school fees, cutting enrolment by 14%. GDP fell from $309 to $210 a head; those in abject poverty rose to 51% of the population. In Chile in 1973 unemployment was 4.3%; after ten years of Pinochet and wage cuts of 40% it was 22%.<br />Between 1960 and 1980, when the welfare state was still the model, income per head rose by 73% in Latin America and by 34% in Africa; people lived another ten years longer. Since 1980, under the Thatcher-Reagan model, income per head in Latin America has risen by only 6%, and fell by 23% in Africa; life expectancy has fallen - which the Financial Times' monetarist Sam Brittan intelligently attributed to `bad luck'.<br />The European Community's secret memo `Domestic Regulation: Necessity and Transparency' abandons the `sovereign right of government to regulate services' that Trade Minister Richard Caborn promised MPs that the General Agreement on Trade in Services would observe. This won't just apply to what we think of as services, given that the US Government succeeded in defining bananas as services!<br />Between 1983 and 1997, 85% of the increase in US wealth went to just 1% of the population; productivity rose by 17%, real wages fell by 3%.<br />Blair is in the US's pocket.

This collection of fourteen essays studies the roles played by the politicians' chief advisers. The essays are based on new research in Britain's archives, although key files, like MI6's and the Joint Intelligence Committee's, and those on the Government's War Book, are still closed. And Eden ordered the Cabinet Secretary, Sir Norman Brook, to destroy all the evidence of the collusion between Britain, France and Israel.<br /> This is a very important book. The contributors add a great deal to our knowledge of this deplorable episode. Particularly outstanding is Lewis Johnman's essay on the role of Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice, the Foreign Office's Senior Legal Advisor.<br />Sir Pierson Dixon, the UK Permanent Representative at the UN, warned Eden, \\"it is quite out of the question to extract from the Security Council a good vote on a resolution designed to justify subsequent use of force, particularly force exerted by two nations without further reference to the United Nations.\\"<br />Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice agreed, \\"It is very difficult to get into the heads of people in this country that the Security Council is not an institution for settling disputes, or even for doing justice between nations, but an institution for preventing or stopping wars ... The argument that by going to the Security Council we have done everything possible and that the Security Council having proved itself impotent, we are now justified in going ahead on our own, may well appeal to public opinion in this country, but the argument is based on a misconception of the real functions of the Security Council.\\"<br />Fitzmaurice also noted, \\"under the Charter any preventative war initiated by a government on its own responsibility is aggression.\\" Lord McNair, ex-President of the International Court, concurred, telling the government, \\"our intervention is illegal.\\"<br />In 1953, Eden had written a Cabinet memorandum that said, \\"In the second half of the twentieth century we cannot hope to maintain our position in the Middle East by the methods of the last century. ... Our strategic purposes in the Middle East can no longer be served by arrangements which local nationalism will regard as military occupation by foreign troops.\\" After the attack, as the British Ambassador to Egypt accurately predicted, \\"The British and French could not continue their occupation indefinitely. They would have to leave again.\\"<br />The government said that no attacks would be made on areas where civilian casualties were inevitable, then ordered the bombing of Cairo and Heliopolis.

In Part One, he describes the rise of the American empire. Part Two describes its institutions: the US-controlled World Bank, the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund, which all benefit the USA. The US has the sole veto power in all three. Part Three describes what Herman Kahn called `the greatest rip-off ever achieved', the way the US's ruling class levies us all to pay for its aggressive wars, just as the Roman Empire levied tribute to pay for its constant wars. Similarly Britain, Germany and Japan all pay for the US's military bases in their countries.<br />In 1945, as in 1918, Britain led Europe's capitulation to the USA's debt demands. The British ruling class chose dependency on the US ruling class. The USA insisted that Britain ended the sterling bloc, accepted IMF controls, did not impose exchange controls, and did not devalue. As Hudson writes, \\"The Anglo-American Loan Agreement spelled the end of Britain as a Great Power.\\"<br />The 1945-51 Labour government's huge spending on unnecessary imperial, counter-revolutionary wars robbed our industry of investment. This excessive military spending meant that we had constantly to borrow from the IMF, increasing our dependence on the USA. Now Britain is the USA's Trojan horse in Europe, against Britain's interests.<br />Hudson immodestly claims that his analysis supersedes Lenin. He says that the US national government's interests, not the private interests of the capitalist class, drive the system. He claims that the US government subordinates `the interests of its national bourgeoisie to the autonomous interests of the national government'. But is the US government really independent of the capitalist class? How `autonomous' are these interests?...	2003-04-17

He begins by setting the scene in which health workers struggle to do their jobs. He shows how the global debt crisis, expressing US domination of the international financial institutions, damages health across the world. US-imposed Structural Adjustment Programs force dis-investment in health and education. He notes how first world banks have made at least three times the amount they originally lent, and how no country has ever paid off its IMF debts.<br />The heart of the book is a superb chapter on the Cuban model of development. 40% of Cuba's GNP, the world's highest proportion, is spent on health and education. By 1974, its doctor-patient ration was better than the USA's or Britain's, and in 1996 it could generously send 600 doctors to South Africa. Cuba has adopted the basics of health promotion - personal autonomy and high self-esteem, leading to neighbourhood advocacy and female emancipation, and to collaboration between health and education workers. Cuba is indeed a `worldwide model of how to organise and administer global health promotion'. Its precondition is a social revolution, based on democratic participation; the old systems of representative democracy simply won't do the job.<br />Theo presents a series of brilliant case studies of primary health care in Nepal, the World Bank-imposed user health fees in Uganda, the effect of HIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe, the privatisation of pharmaceutical provision in India, and the IMF's `shock treatment' of Peru. He details British American Tobacco's assault on China, China's development of its successful health and education systems after the USA ended all its aid programmes to China in 1949, the USA's use of GATT to stop Thailand banning tobacco imports, and the baby milk manufacturing companies' attack on breast-feeding. He also refutes Amartya Sen's pro-capitalist dogmas about the causes of famine.<br />Paul Walker, Vice President of the Socialist Health Association, sums up the book's vital message in his Foreword, \\"capitalism is bad for health; effective health promotion requires a socialist economic and political milieu.\\"President of the Socialist Health Association, sums up the book's vital message in his Foreword, \\"capitalism is bad for health; effective health promotion requires a socialist economic and political milieu.\\"	2003-04-17

Part I's nine essays look at the war's background and history. Part II presents ten diverse opinions on NATO's attack and consequent occupation of Kosovo. There is also a selection of relevant documents, including the notorious Appendix B of the Rambouillet Text, and a chronology of events.<br /> NATO continually praised itself for precisely attacking only military targets, but they gradually changed to attacking civilian targets like TV stations, and to using cluster bombs, eventually killing three times as many civilians as soldiers.<br /> In a particularly significant essay, Patrick Thornberry, Professor of International Law at Keele University, shows how international law embodies respect for state sovereignty, and reminds us that the UN's first purpose is to maintain `international peace and security'. Article 2(7) of the UN Charter protects the state in its domestic jurisdiction from UN intervention, except for enforcement measures unanimously agreed by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter. Thornberry writes, \\"The Milosevic indictment does not contain a genocide count.\\" There was no genocide. \\"Security Council resolutions - taken singly or together - did not authorise the use of force against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\\" \\"Presumptively, action outside the Charter framework violates it.\\" The editors agree, concluding, \\"NATO went beyond the authority of the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council and effectively set them aside.\\"<br /> Humanitarian intervention is illegal under the UN Charter. The International Court of Justice, in the case of Nicaragua v United States of America, ruled against the US government, stating, \\"as to respect for human rights in Nicaragua, the use of force could not be the appropriate method to monitor or ensure such respect.\\" Yet the British government uses this illegal assault as a precedent for its subsequent illegal wars of aggression.<br /> A supposedly temporary NATO protectorate (which is still there), imposed by 30,000 NATO troops, did not stop Kosovan forces from driving out 100,000 civilians, half the Serb population, after the war ended.

He seeks to use only the best available statistical information from internationally recognised research institutes: 2930 references and a 70-page bibliography attest to the depth of his research into health, life expectancy, food, forests, resources, pollution and global warming.<br />For example, we are constantly told that our forests are vanishing, but according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, the world's forests covered 40.24 million square kilometres in 1950, and 43.04 million in 1994. 80% of the world's original rainforest is still intact.<br />The evidence that Lomborg presents undermines the misanthropic scare mongering of leading environmentalists like Paul Ehrlich, who said in 1967 that India was doomed. Lomborg explodes the Greens' litany of disaster and their liberal contempt for productive forces; he shows how wonderfully creative workers are, and how technological progress brings great benefits. Listening to some Greens, you would think that our factories produced only pollution! In the historic debate between the anti-industry parson Malthus and the pro-industry Marx, Lomborg is clearly with Marx.<br />Unfortunately, Lomborg mistakenly credits `market economies', not workers' creativity, for this progress, although, as he notes, the most important welfare improvement of the last 50 years was achieved in post-revolutionary China, and the most significant worsening of welfare has happened in post-counter-revolutionary Russia and Eastern Europe.<br /> Some environmentalists mistakenly damn GM foods, pesticides, the chlorination of water and vaccination, technological achievements that all help to save us from killer diseases. As Lomborg points out, nobody has died from eating GM foods, or from cancer caused by pesticides, or from chlorination or vaccination. Banning GM foods and pesticides would reduce yields of fruit and veg, making them dearer and diets worse, and would therefore increase deaths from cancer. Peru didn't chlorinate its water, which resulted in the cholera epidemic of 1991. Falling rates of vaccination are increasing the risks of lethal epidemics.<br />He does not ignore the huge problems facing the world: every year, ten million children under the age of five die of preventable diseases; 1.1 billion people still have no clean drinking water, and 2.5 billion have no access to sanitation. But to solve these problems, we need a clear-headed prioritisation of resources, not counsels of despair.ning GM foods and pesticides would reduce yields of fruit and veg, making them dearer and diets worse, and would therefore increase deaths from cancer.

M. Trevelyan. Now he adds a celebratory image of the British Empire, puffing it as the greatest show on earth.<br />But there is nothing original in this book. It is based entirely on secondary sources and anecdotes; for instance, he recycles the ancient jokes about the CMGs, KCMGs and GCMGs of the hugely tedious honours system.<br />This is an imperial-minded study of the Imperial mentalite. He displays (and himself clearly shares) the British ruling class's hierarchical and rural fantasy world, which they clung to in fear of the real world of industry, cities and democracy. He tells us of the British-imposed Viceroy of India, who in the 1930s had no fewer than 6000 servants! Like all too many historians, he indulges in abject hero-worship of Churchill the bugler of Empire.<br />In an extraordinary passage he writes, \\"For as the British contemplated the unprecedented numbers massed together in their new industrial cities, they tended to compare these great towns at home with the `dark continents' overseas, and thus equate the workers in factories with coloured peoples abroad.\\"  So `the British' observed the workers in Britain's factories, who in the eyes of Cannadine, and of the ruling class, were obviously not British at all!<br />In a book about Empire and class, Cannadine manages to write the phrase `ruling class' just once, and avoids the term working class altogether. As active subjects, he much prefers terms like `the British' and `the official mind'. The word `domination', when he uses it - rarely - is always in inverted commas.<br />Cannadine's October 1998 article in the Financial Times showed what a Blimp he is. He claimed that England - he meant Britain - was not `a particularly unequal society', and seriously suggested that \\"the best way to make our nation a classless society\\" would be \\"that we all stop talking about class.\\" This book reveals the same crass idealism; not surprisingly, the Thatcherite bigot Niall Ferguson praises it fulsomely!alking about class.\\" This book reveals the same crass idealism; not surprisingly, the Thatcherite bigot Niall Ferguson praises it fulsomely!	2003-03-12

This collection of 19 articles is divided into three parts, on Capital, exploitation and conflict, Global capitalism, and Crisis and the supercession of capitalism. The contributors, from across the world, reflect the increasingly widespread understanding that capitalism doesn't work. They analyse the exploitation intrinsic to capitalism and recognise that in countries like Britain there are just the two classes, a tiny minority of exploiters and the vast majority who depend on selling their labour power to make a living.<br />The struggle against capitalism is rooted in the workplace, where we must fight for democracy, as Saad-Filho says in his Introduction. We need to be in work, in our union, and fighting the employer. Adding together any number of pressure groups, even infusing those groups with anti-capitalist ideology will not do what is needed to end capitalism - transform the ideology of the working class.<br />Ben Fine accuses our trade unions of pursuing sectional interests both nationally and sectorally, when the problem is that our unions are hardly fighting for our industries and services at all. He also sees defence workers as depending on war, and energy and car workers as depending on pollution: so to end war and pollution, all we have to do is destroy what remains of our manufacturing industry!<br />Targeting the IMF or McDonald's is to attack symptoms, not the root of the problem, as Ellen Meiksins Wood shows. It is not a matter of building a bigger demo next time. It would really terrify the ruling classes of the world if all the anti-globalisation protestors turned to focus on working in their workplaces and trade unions to weaken and destroy capitalism.<br />We need workers' nationalism, that is, workers deciding their own future, in their own lands and for their own interests.

Using sources like I. F. Stone, Chomsky, Herman, Parenti, Solomon and Zinn, Smith shows a brutal ruling class that commits crimes at home and abroad in the name of anti-communism. He details the US state's appalling assaults on other countries, from Hiroshima to Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Nicaragua, Panama, Iraq and Yugoslavia.<br /> In 1990, US ambassador Glaspie tells Saddam Hussein, \\"we have no opinion on Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with Kuwait.\\" Bush then double-crosses Iraq by invading. US forces drop fifteen times more explosives on Iraq than it had used in all World War Two. When asked how many Iraqis had been killed, Colin Powell, the liberals' hero, replies, \\"It's really not a number I'm terribly interested in.\\" He also says that the US invasion of Somalia was `great public relations'.<br /> The head of the US Information Agency tells a reporter, \\"the vipers, the bloodsuckers, the middlemen - that's what needs to be rehabilitated in the Soviet Union. That's what makes our kind of country click!\\"<br /> Smith writes of the USA in 1995, \\"Profits zoom capital swells, stocks boom, assets consolidate, accident rates and labor hours rise; wages, benefits, and working conditions decline. The Wall Street Journal announces that corporate profits are up `an enormous 41%' over 1993, a `colossal success' resulting from a `sharp' decline in the `share going to labor'.\\"<br />The USA is the only industrial nation without a health plan. Consequently 100,000 people a year die from lack of access to treatment. Smith tells how Clinton, so fawned over by last year's Labour Party Conference, ends federal income support for low-paid workers, plunging millions more children into poverty, a step no Republican President ever dared to take. Just like Blair, wrecking the NHS, the Tube, the fire and rail services, in ways that even Thatcher did not dare.<br /> The cheap response is to decry any criticism as `anti-American'. But it is no more anti-American to oppose the US state than it is anti-British to oppose Thatcher or Blair.her did not dare.<br /> The cheap response is to decry any criticism as `anti-American'.

To a remarkable extent he succeeds, although his review section is all too brief, a mere twenty pages. As he notes, Alexander Werth's superb Russia at war is still the unsurpassed account of the battle.<br />Stalingrad was indeed the turning point of the entire war: as the American historian Stephen Ambrose wrote, \\"The Russians, alone, stemmed the Nazi tide, then began to roll it back.\\" The strategic initiative passed from Hitler to the Soviet Union. The battle ended the string of Allied defeats, and opened the way for all our subsequent victories.<br />As Roberts writes, \\"No battle changed history more than Stalingrad.\\" He also shows how Stalingrad resulted from the Soviet Union's economic, political and moral superiority - \\"the successful mobilisation and deployment of Soviet material superiority - that was a matter of effective politics and economics.\\"<br />Soviet forces inflicted more than 90% of the Nazis' losses, 600 divisions, ten million casualties. President Roosevelt said, \\"the Russian armies are killing more Axis personnel and destroying more Axis material than all the other twenty-five United Nations put together.\\"<br />The Soviet Union assisted the D-Day landings by stepping up its attacks in Eastern Europe, stopping Hitler from reinforcing Normandy. As the BBC said, \\"But for the Russians, D-Day would have been impossible.\\" Even after D-Day, Soviet forces were still fighting twice as many German soldiers on the Eastern front as the British and US forces were fighting on the Western front.<br />Without Stalin, the Bolshevik Party and the Red Army, Hitler would have won the war, Britain would be enslaved, and we would be living, if at all, in concentration camps. We must never forget the huge debt that we all owe to the Soviet Union.	2003-01-31

They play the role of friends at court, gently warning the US government that invading Iraq would be `overplaying its hand'. Their book illustrates how international journalism produces intrusive judgements on the internal affairs of other countries, assisting imperialism to prepare its attacks on sovereign states. But whatever Iraq does inside its own borders is no justification for international aggression and preventive war.<br />But on the other hand, the authors do remind us of some important facts. The US/British sanctions against Iraq have killed an estimated 500,000 children under five, and another 500,000 people. Aren't peacekeepers supposed to save hostages, not massacre them? The Pope called the sanctions `biological warfare against a civilian population' - but that can't be right, because our rulers say that only Iraq uses biological weapons! They note that the USA shipped large stocks of its chemical weapons to the Gulf in 1990 - so it would not be too surprising if Iraq, fearing a repeat, protected its soldiers against chemical attack.<br />Far from Iraq being in league with the Al-Qa'ida terrorists, the mujehadin in Afghanistan sent fighters to assist the USA in its 1990-91 war against Iraq. Afterwards, the CIA gave captured Iraqi arms and ammunition to the mujehadin - so far the only proven arming of terrorists! War against Iraq would not weaken the terrorists; it is far more likely to recruit for them.<br />The authors point out that an International Atomic Energy Authority official said, \\"We have closed down all their nuclear facilities and activities.\\" Dick Cheney, now Vice-President, agreed, saying in 1991, \\"Saddam Hussein is out of the nuclear business\\" - unlike the USA and Britain, which still threaten to use them.<br />The critical issue over Iraq is not Saddam Hussein, not even greed for oil or White House dreams of world domination, but whether the genuine superpower in the world - the working class - says, \\"No war\\".he genuine superpower in the world - the working class - says, \\"No war\\".	2003-01-31

Hitchens praises Orwell too as `an early Cold Warrior'.<br />Hitchens claims that Orwell always supported India's independence. Would that include when Orwell wrote that India's independence would be `nonsense,' and that India could `no more be independent than can a cat or a dog'?<br />Most historians of the war in Spain believe that the `revolution' supported by the POUM distracted from the war against Franco and his Nazi backers. Hitchens denies this, claiming bizarrely, \\"the words `most historians' are meaningless; no such consensus exists or ever has.\\" He dismisses those who fought for the Republic as `the Stalintern forces'.<br />Orwell wrote Animal Farm during World War Two, writing against our main ally, which was destroying three-quarters of the Nazi army's divisions. Why are Animal Farm and 1984 unavoidable in schools? Simply because they serve the employing class.<br />In 1948, Orwell wrote against the trade union movement - \\"a strike is in effect a blow against the community as a whole, including the strikers themselves, and its net effect is inflationary.\\" Tony Blair couldn't put it better!<br />As for Orwell's fabled independence of mind - when in the Empire's service, he served the Empire; when in Spain in turmoil, he was for `the revolution'; in England at peace, he was for peace (but against the anti-fascist alliance that could have saved peace); in England at war he was for England and for war; when Labour was in office, he was for Labour; in the Cold War, he was for the Cold War.<br />Hitchens, like Orwell's biographers rehearsing their own treacheries, tries to defend Orwell's giving a list of what he called `crypto-Communists and fellow-travellers' to a Foreign Office agent.<br /><br />Hitchens hates `the crowd', who `will yell with joy to see' rebels `dragged to the scaffold'. He ends by writing, \\"politics are relatively unimportant,' which means in practice, other people are unimportant.<br />He lauds `the few irreducible individuals who maintain allegiance' to principles, praising himself.

Unfortunately, but unsurprisingly, the book is very anti-communist; it whitewashes the US state and blames the Soviet Union and China for the war in Korea and for the `Cold War'.<br />But the record shows that the USA was the aggressor in East Asia: it intervened in Korea's internal affairs from 1945 by occupying the south of the country, and it intervened in China's internal affairs in 1950 by sending the 7th Fleet into the Formosan Straits to defend Chiang Kai-Shek's defeated forces on Taiwan. These acts broke the Cairo Agreement, the Potsdam Agreement and the UN Charter.<br />Thornton claims that Stalin ordered Kim Il-Sung to start the Korean War to `prod China into conflict with the United States'. But Stalin did not cause US-Chinese enmity; the US interference in China's internal affairs was quite enough to gain China's enmity.<br />Thornton believes that President Harry Truman outsmarted Stalin and Mao! He writes that Truman tried to keep the Soviet Union and China apart, but this ploy failed when they signed their Treaty of Alliance in 1950. Thornton then saves his thesis, at the cost of contradicting himself, by arguing that Sino-Soviet cooperation also served Truman's purpose!<br />Certainly, Truman got the war he wanted: he rejected all chances of a peaceful settlement of the Korean conflict, and he provoked China to enter the war, so intensifying the `Cold War'. But he also got a defeat - which he didn't want! China beat the USA by stopping it from destroying the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Mao and Stalin together prevented World War Three by stopping the USA from invading China. As Mao had warned, \\"if the US imperialists won the war, they would become more arrogant and would threaten us.\\"<br />Before, during and after the war in Korea, Britain's Labour government began its long stint as the USA's jackal, giving the USA the political support that it needed for its unjust wars.rnment began its long stint as the USA's jackal, giving the USA the political support that it needed for its unjust wars.	2002-11-28

Before that attack, how many publishers would have thought of producing a book by a New York firefighter?<br /> Each plane carried 15,000 gallons of fuel, which when ignited by the impact caused 1000-degree fires. Each impact was about a million tons. More than 300 firefighters were killed. The attacks showed how cowardly and ugly terrorism is - the Vietnamese never resorted to terrorism, despite years of aggression and occupation, of chemical and biological attacks and repeated nuclear threats.<br /> Think of the sheer courage it took to run into the burning towers that morning, to evacuate everyone that they could. They have a working class pride in doing your job: \\"We all continued to do our jobs. That was our hallmark.\\"<br /> Afterwards, the hellish horror, the sights, sounds and smells, the shock, played over and over again in their minds. 400 firefighters with sleeping eating and breathing problems had to take medical leave. The employer offered no help to those stuck in grief and loss. So McCole took responsibility for his workmates' health, insisting that the union got the firefighters to follow a programme of diet, exercise and saunas.<br /><br /> On the anthrax threats, McCole writes with working class common sense, \\"the news didn't help, sensationalising every last bit of it. Sometimes it seemed like the news was worse than what had really happened.\\" He writes, \\"no lasting peace was ever sustained by victory in war alone.\\"<br /> He ends with an eloquent appeal: \\"For those of us in the Fire Department, caring for the families of our brotherhood has become a part of our everyday affairs. But the responsibility to do likewise will be borne by everyone in some way, somehow. As the years roll on, the most positive effect that the events of 9/11 can have is that we recognise we all share the common purpose of caring for one another. I can only hope that the compassion shown by my brothers in the Fire Department on that fateful day will be an example to others in the years to come.

His many superb books include Le mythe de la croisade de Franco (1964), and Guernica! Guernica! A Study of Journalism, Diplomacy, Propaganda and History (1977). This new book is a triumphant affirmation of his career as a historian and opponent of fascism. Based on years of careful research, and written with lucidity, wit and humour, this book is both an excellent introduction to the vast literature on the war, and a significant contribution to that literature.<br />Southworth tells us exactly how Spanish fascists concocted the story of a `communist plot' to try to justify their July 1936 military uprising against the democratically elected government. He shows how Spain's fascists accused their enemies of the anti-democratic conspiracy that they were brewing themselves - a technique that fascists have used from Berlin in 1933 to Indonesia in 1965. Fascist propagandists throughout Europe, particularly in Britain, publicised the story of the `plot'. Too many subsequent historians have followed these propagandists and repeated their fascist fabrications. Southworth refutes in detail both the crude, open pro-Franco propagandists like Brian Crozier and the more sly anti-working class biases of Hugh Thomas.<br /> The second part of the book deals with the writings that most influenced General Franco himself. It tells the story of Franco's associations with the Entente Internationale contre la Troisieme International, which consisted of a White Russian and a Swiss lawyer. This anti-democratic, anti-communist propaganda unit purveyed the usual dreary litany of diatribes against Jews and Freemasons; it naturally backed Hitler, Mussolini and Franco from first to last, and it passed on and embellished every lie and slander about trade unions, the labour movement, socialists and communists. Southworth proves that this tenth-rate dishonest tripe had a profound influence on General Franco.	2002-11-12

This helps to derail the drive to war.<br /> Ritter worked for seven years in the UN's Special Commission, Unscom, charged with destroying all Iraq's weapons of mass destruction (WMD) capabilities. He states, \\"We can say unequivocally that the industrial infrastructure needed by Iraq to produce nuclear weapons had been eliminated.\\" \\"We eliminated the nuclear program, and for Iraq to have reconstituted it would require undertaking activities eminently detectable by intelligence services.\\"<br /><br /> Similarly, Iraq has no chemical weapons capability. In 1996, Unscom destroyed Iraq's chemical weapons facilities. The weapons it did produce, VX gas and the nerve agents Sarin and Tabun, have only a 5-year life, so any stocks would now be harmless goo. Iraq has not been able to recreate these facilities. \\"The manufacture of chemical weapons emits vented gases that would have been detected by now if they existed. We've been watching, via satellite and other means, and have seen none of this. If Iraq was producing weapons today, we'd have definitive proof, plain and simple.\\"<br /><br /> And Iraq has no biological weapons capability. In 1995, Unscom destroyed the factories and equipment producing biological weapons, which last only three years. Subsequently, \\"we never found any evidence of ongoing research and development or retention.\\" Nor does Iraq have the means to deliver the WMD that it doesn't have. \\"Iraq doesn't have the capabilities to do long-range ballistic missiles.\\"<br />Ritter sums up, \\"Iraq has been fundamentally disarmed.\\"<br /> He also shows that there is no link, rather mutual enmity, between Iraq and Al Qa'ida, that forced regime change would not lead to democracy, that invading Iraq would be far harder than evicting its forces from Kuwait, and that Bush's contempt for the UN could destroy it. Most worryingly, he points out that the Pentagon plans to use nuclear weapons if the US attack on Iraq starts to fail.empt for the UN could destroy it.

He shows how the US government destroyed the UNs weapons inspection agency Unscom. On 30 October 1998, the UN Security Council, led by the USA, refused to confirm that it would lift sanctions even after Unscom had verified that Iraq had disarmed. This breached Paragraph 22 of its own Resolution 687, and Iraq, temporarily, withdrew its cooperation with Unscom. A month later, it restored cooperation, but the US government had already decided to launch the Desert Fox bombing attack.<br />The US and British governments are covering up the fact that the inspections succeeded. By 1992, Unscom had eliminated Iraqs long-range missile programme. By 1995, the International Atomic Energy Authority had eliminated Iraqs nuclear weapons programme. According to Richard Butler, the head of the Unscom team, Unscom was within a few weeks of completing its work when the US government pulled it out. Why didnt the US government want the inspections to succeed? Because it didnt want Iraq peacefully disarmed, it wanted Iraq defeated in war. Why? Because only by occupying Iraq can the US government get what it really wants - control of Iraqs oil.<br />The Bush government continues vehemently to oppose inspections. The Washington Post noted concern by Wolfowitz and his civilian colleagues in the Pentagon that new inspections could torpedo their plans for military action to remove Hussein from power. As Colin Powell said recently, if UN weapons inspectors returned to Iraq under existing agreements, the US would find ways to thwart that. So Bush is determined to wreck the new agreements achieved on 1 October. He does not want inspections, because they would prevent war; he wants to prevent weapons inspections so that he can launch a war.<br /> Rai puts forward ten reasons for opposing the war: there is no evidence that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction; there is no link between Iraq and 11 September; war would not be about regime change but about dictator change; war could trigger a humanitarian disaster; war would endanger the Kurds; war would be illegal; Iraqs neighbours fear Bush, not Saddam; US and British generals oppose the war; 58% of the British people oppose the war; war could trigger a world recession.<br />One link between Al-Qaida and Iraq that the US government has proposed was an alleged meeting in Prague in April 2001 between Mohamed Atta, the alleged ringleader of the suicide hijackers, and the Iraqi intelligence officer, Ahmad al-Ani. This allegation got worldwide coverage. But, as the BBC reported on 1 May, investigations indicate that at the time of the alleged meeting with the Iraqi agent, Ahmed Chalil Ibrahim Samir Ani, in April 2001, he [Atta] was in Virginia Beach and Florida. Time magazine reported on 13 May, the best hope for Iraqi ties to the attack  a report that lead hijacker Mohamed Atta met with an Iraqi intelligence officer in the Czech Republic  was discredited last week. Yet Andrew Buncombe of the Independent reported (26 September) that US officials are still using this story to try to prove a link between Iraq and al-Qaida, and he wrongly described the story as disputed, not as refuted.<br />Additionally, the danger of Iraq using any weapons of mass destruction is obviously greatest if it is fighting for its survival. An attack would provoke the actions that it is supposed to prevent!  Iraq has made no threats to use these weapons, but the US, British and Israeli governments have all threatened to use nuclear weapons against Iraq, threats which themselves are breaches of international law.<br />There is no right of pre-emptive self-defence in international law. The Bush-Blair rationale would open the door to any government claiming that it too was justified in attacking any other state that allegedly had any weapons of mass destruction!<br />Bushs threat - which Blair has consistently backed  to attack Iraq even without UN warrant is lynch law. By contrast, the French government has rightly rejected the idea of a war to overthrow Saddam without UN backing. Further, even if the lynch mob bribes the sheriff into signing a warrant, or into looking the other way, it is still lynch law: the Security Council has no authority to tear up the UN Charter, which permits the use of force against a sovereign state only when it is unambiguously self-defence against an armed attack.<br />Stopping Blair from backing Bush would stop Bush.

He tells how in 1992 General Colin Powell backed the Somalia operation, claiming that he had a clear exit strategy when he hadn't. He weakly expanded the mission, contrary to his own professed beliefs, by sending a battalion of Rangers and a Delta Force Unit. Their gung-ho pursuit of General Aidid led to their humiliating defeat and withdrawal. Somalia was a defining example of the failure to `nation-build' by the gun. Powell, ever the bureaucrat, saw his job as protecting his boss, right or wrong.<br /> In February 1990, Bush's deputy secretary of state, Lawrence Eagleburger, gave Slovenia's leaders the green light to secede. The Slovenian and Croatian secessions destroyed Yugoslavia's integrity and independence, causing the Bosnian war. In 1993, the new Clinton administration's first action was to kill off the Vance-Owen peace plan that it \\"arrogantly disdained ... , which, had it gone through, might have saved hundreds of thousands of lives.\\"<br /> Having unleashed the dogs of war, the Clinton administration launched a brutal airpower assault in 1999. This attack on a sovereign country, which had committed no aggression against any other country, was not authorised by the UN, and was therefore illegal under international law. After the war, the US government imposed the 1995 Dayton Accords, on almost exactly the same terms as the Vance-Owen plan. The only difference was that Dayton was to be implemented by NATO forces, in line with US government policy that \\"We must seek to prevent the emergence of European-only security arrangements which would undermine NATO.\\"event the emergence of European-only security arrangements which would undermine NATO.\\"	2002-10-14

Instead, it includes an account of 1966's NATO-backed massacre of a million Indonesians, which the Australian embassy in Jakarta called a `cleansing operation', and an essay on the Australian government's appalling treatment of the Aborigines. The central part of the book consists of two longer essays, one on globalisation and the war on terrorism, which Pilger wrongly conflates, and the other on the proposed attack on Iraq.<br />Pilger denounces the war on terrorism, but surely a war on the feudal-minded terrorists who targeted and killed thousands of innocent workers is not wrong. He stigmatises what he calls the `leading terrorist states in the world', instancing Algeria, China and Russia. These are all states that have fought Islamic fundamentalist terrorist groups. So it's terrorist to fight terrorists?<br />It is wrong to link the war on terrorism with the proposed attack on Iraq, as both Bush and Pilger do. But Pilger is right to oppose Bush's proposed attack on Iraq and his illegitimate threats against states unconnected to the Al Qa'ida terrorists.<br />Pilger cites the New York Times, \\"The Central Intelligence Agency has no evidence that Iraq has engaged in terrorist operations against the United States in nearly a decade, and the agency is also convinced that President Saddam Hussein has not provided chemical or biological weapons to al-Qa'ida.\\" There is no evidence that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction: Scott Ritter, a former UN weapons inspector, summed up, \\"Does Iraq have a chemical weapons programme today?

Its chapters cover: the Middle East and Palestine to 1914; Ottoman society, Palestine, and the origins of Zionism, 1800-1914; World War One, Great Britain, and the peace settlements, 1914-21; Palestine between the wars: Zionism, the Palestinian Arabs, and the British mandate, 1920-39; World War Two and the creation of Israel, 1939-48; the beginning of the Arab-Israeli conflict, 1949-57; from Suez to the 1967 war, 1957-67; war and the search for peace, 1967-76; Lebanon, the West Bank, and the Camp David Accords, 1977-84; from pariah to partner: the PLO and the quest for peace, 1984-93; and finally, Israeli-Palestinian/Arab negotiations and agreements, August 1993-March 2000.<br />Key facts, of contemporary relevance, emerge from the narrative: Ben Gurion's aggressive approach was self-defeating - the Gaza raid of 1955 and the invasion of Suez in 1956 both made Israel less secure. The joint British-French-Israeli attack on Egypt, against the will of the United Nations, was a political fiasco. In 1967, the US government encouraged Israel to attack Egypt again, at the same time advising Egypt to hold back until a diplomatic resolution was reached! The first, key, Oslo agreement of 1993 was achieved without US participation, showing that the US is more a hindrance than a help to winning peace.<br />The Netanyahu government of 1996-99, like the present Sharon government, refused to carry out the agreements of Oslo 1, Oslo 2, the Hebron Protocol of 1997 and the Wye Memorandum of 1998. At Wye, Israel agreed not to `initiate or take any step that will change the status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip'. As Smith notes, this was `a proviso that Israel had consistently ignored and would ignore in the future'.<br /><br />The Palestinians have long recognised Israel's right `to exist in peace and security', but Israeli governments have consistently refused to reciprocate. Yet the majority of both peoples want peace, and recognise each other's right `to exist in peace and security'. Both peoples must ensure that their leaders act on this understanding.te.

He writes, \\"We must urge debt-financed public works programmes, scorning the paranoia about budget deficits.\\" But the European Central Bank, which he supports, has a built-in paranoia about budget deficits and adamantly opposes debt-financed public works programmes! He has double standards - it's bad if a British government cuts our spending on health and education, but good if the ECB cuts our spending on health and education!<br />He predicts, \\"Europe will enjoy a boom as the output gap is clawed back.\\" Some boom - four million unemployed in Germany, and rising. He sagely warns, \\"Calling for a different EMU [Economic and Monetary Union] - one where growth and employment have a higher priority - is a perfectly reasonable game of political charades, but it is not the choice the country faces.\\" And then he himself calls for `a different EMU' by calling for rewriting the Maastricht Treaty which spawned EMU!<br />He concludes, \\"It is true that in a single-currency area the members lose the right to adjust their exchange rate and interest rate. In truth they have little autonomy now. What they gain is exchange rate stability, more control of fiscal policy, and the chance to develop national policies that reflect national choices within the overall umbrella of monetary union.\\" So under EMU we lose rights and gain chances - just like what the capitalist market `offers'!	2002-09-11

He contends that, &#147;biased Israeli and Arab textbooks have fostered and maintained a kind of silent conflict between the parties. ... my hope is that better textbooks - free of bias, prejudice, inaccuracies, and omissions - on both sides of the conflict will result in a better atmosphere, congenial to the successful consummation of peaceful relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors.&#148;<br />His Chapter 1 presents a rationale for studying school textbooks. Chapter 2 investigates the changing attitudes in Israel&#146;s education system towards teaching the Arab-Israeli conflict. Chapter 3 presents case studies of textbook coverage of various subjects and historical periods: Islam, the Ottoman Empire, the first and second Aliyah periods (1882-1902 and 1902-14), the First World War agreements, the British mandate in Palestine (1920-48), the 1947-48 war, the 1956 war, the 1967 war, the post-1967 period and the Arab minority in Israel. He notes that even text books published in 1999 printed maps of late 19th-century Palestine that omitted all the many towns inhabited by Arabs!<br />The book charts Israeli educationalists&#146; growing awareness that Zionist ideology distorts the history of Israel and of its relations with its neighbours. The 1967 war, Israel&#146;s war against Lebanon in 1982, the Palestinian Intifada of 1988 and the peace process of the 1990s, all forced many Israelis to view the Arab-Israeli conflict more even-handedly and improved the quality of the textbooks. The newer textbooks present more self-critical accounts, instead of projecting all evil onto Arab people, and allow that self-criticism is a source of strength not a sign of weakness.<br />Similar studies in other countries have shown that textbooks of Empire demonise and distort colonised nations and their liberation movements, that US textbooks demonise communism, and that Irish textbooks demonise the other guy&#146;s religion.<br /><br /> Hopefully, this fine book will achieve the author&#146;s aim of assisting the development of peaceful relations between Israel and its  neighbours.tions and their liberation movements, that US textbooks demonise communism, and that Irish textbooks demonise the other guy&#146;s religion.<BR> <BR> Hopefully, this fine book will achieve the author&#146;s aim of assisting the development of peaceful relations between Israel and its  neighbours.	2002-09-08

To justify this absurd diktat, they put forward some remarkably untenable ideas.<br />Hutton claims that the USA has more class mobility than Europe. Wrong - Peter Gottschalk and Sheldon Danzinger showed that US workers are less socially mobile than low-paid workers in European countries. Hutton predicts, \\"the German economy will start to pick up quite smartly.\\" Wrong - unemployment in Germany has now risen to more than four million.<br />Giddens writes that capitalism is `fairer than most socialists tended to assume'. Wrong - 86% of Wall Street's gains go to the richest 10% in the US, and US Chief Executive Officers get on average 475 times what their blue-collar workers get. Poverty, he grandly proclaims, is no longer a condition, just the odd brief episode. Wrong - in Britain, three million old people live in poverty, and worldwide, ten million more people now live in poverty than in 1990. He writes, \\"capitalism has buried the working class.\\" Wrong - worldwide, there are more workers than ever before.<br />Giddens tells the German government to reform its labour market and welfare system to make it more like the market, because \\"existing structures of the welfare state are no longer able to deliver\\". Wrong - it is the market that doesn't work: the average investing household in the USA, forced into stock market gambling to fund their health care, pensions and children's education, has lost $45,000 since the 2000 crash.<br /> They tell us that after the coal-based industrial revolution, then the oil-fired economy, we are now in the third revolution, the third way of the `knowledge-based', services economy. Wrong - Britain's decline in manufacturing is due to the dominance of finance capital, not to `a worldwide trend towards a services economy'. Between 1973 and 1992 manufacturing output rose by 25% in Germany, 27% in France, 85% in Italy and 119% in Japan, while in Britain it rose by just 1%.Between 1973 and 1992 manufacturing output rose by 25% in Germany, 27% in France, 85% in Italy and 119% in Japan, while in Britain it rose by just 1%.	2002-09-08

Contributors include Denis Halliday, formerly the UN humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, Robert Fisk and John Pilger.<br /> It documents the ongoing war's human, social and environmental costs. Eleven years of bombing and sanctions have prevented Iraq from importing food, medicines and other necessities, claiming hundreds of thousands of lives, many of them children, while leaving the government unscathed.<br /> Anthony Arnove in his Introduction shows that the US-British policy towards Iraq is not about enforcing international law. In fact, the record shows that the US and British governments have broken international law time after time.<br />Resolution 687 states that when Iraq destroys its weapons of mass destruction, sanctions `shall have no further force or effect'. Yet US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said, \\"We do not agree with the nations who argue that if Iraq complies with its obligations concerning weapons of mass destruction, sanctions should be lifted.\\" And Scott Ritter, former chief inspector of the UN inspection team, said in October 1999, \\"Iraq has been disarmed. Iraq today possesses no meaningful weapons of mass destruction.\\" He judges that Iraq does not have the ability to produce, or deploy, chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.<br />The US government illegally perverted the UN inspection team's work by inserting CIA operatives who spied on Iraq and passed information to the Pentagon (which used it to pick targets).<br /> There is no UN mandate for the incessant US-British bombing of Iraq, or for the `no-fly zones'. In December 1998, the US and British governments launched their `Desert Fox' attack without even telling the UN, and before the Security Council had considered the inspection team's report.<br /> UN Resolution 687 did not give any UN member the right to use force. Resolution 1154 similarly empowered the Security Council, not just one member, to decide what to do in the event of non-compliance.

It is especially timely since it refutes Bush and Blair's war propaganda.<br /> Hiro notes that the 1991 war against Iraq killed from 57,600 to 62,600 people, and cost Iraq $200 billions' worth of damage. US and British bombers dropped 140,000 tons of bombs, equivalent to seven Hiroshimas.<br /> He points out that the UN's weapons inspection team, Unscom, was compromised by the US government which illegally inserted CIA operatives and by its co-operation with Mossad, the Israeli secret service. As the Pentagon stated, \\"information supplied by the monitors had played a part in the careful selection of targets\\" for the subsequent continual bombing attacks.<br /> Hiro reports that by April 1998 Unscom and the International Atomic Energy Authority had destroyed all Iraq's missiles, chemical weapons and nuclear weapons facilities. As Martin Indyk, the US assistant secretary of state for the Middle East, confirmed in September 1999, \\"We do not at this point have evidence of any kind that Saddam Hussein is attempting to rebuild his arsenal.\\"<br /> So how, after twelve years of the most punishing sanctions in history, could Iraq produce weapons of mass destruction? If Bush and Blair had the evidence, they would surely have told us!<br /> Some claim that UN Resolution 687 gives the US the legal warrant to take `all necessary measures' to change Iraq's regime. But the Resolution guaranteed the inviolability of the Iraq-Kuwait border and authorised `all necessary measures to that end in accordance with the Charter'. It \\"does not talk about getting rid of leadership\\", as UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan observed. And as the British commander in the 1991 war, General Peter de la Billiere, noted, he had no mandate to invade Iraq or to take over the country. Nor did Resolution 688 authorise military action: the US and British governments tried to add the `authority to use force', but China and India successfully opposed this.

He commanded the Transjordan Arab Legion from 1939 to 1956 and played an important part in setting up modern Jordan by helping King Abdullah to establish his rule. In 1948 he led the Legion to a limited victory in the first Arab-Israeli war.<br />Benny Morris, a leading Israeli historian, has based his book on extensive study in the archives of David Ben Gurion, the Israel Defence Forces, the Israeli State, the UN, the Haganah and St Anthony's College Middle East Centre, including the Glubb Papers, and in the Public Record Office.<br />Glubb retained the typical imperial contempt for both Jews and Arabs, especially for educated or urban people. But his opposition to Zionism was not based on his anti-Semitism, any more than his support for Arab aspirations was based on his anti-Arabism. He believed that opposing Zionism and supporting Jordan were policies that would strengthen Britain's hold in the Middle East. He was always a loyal servant of the British Empire, acting in what he saw as its best interests.<br />Morris supports the contention, made most notably by Avi Shlaim in his 1988 book, Collusion across the Jordan, that Israel and Jordan collaborated during the 1948 war. He shows how Israel and Jordan came to a secret understanding in November 1947 to partition Palestine and not to attack each other. Since the Transjordan Legion was much the best Arab force opposing Israel, the agreement showed that this war did not really threaten Israel with annihilation.<br />Jordanian forces invaded Palestine not to attack Israel but to annex its Arab-populated eastern regions. The Legion did not attack any area that the UN had planned for Israel. Israel broke the agreement by attacking the Legion in May, July and October 1948. The Legion took over the West Bank and East Jerusalem, saving them from Israeli conquest.

Blair presses on, trying to impose privatisation through PPP on hospitals, schools, colleges, London Underground, etc., as part of his modernising `Third Way'. What is this? Peter Mandelson recently gave the game away when he described modernisers like himself as `all Thatcherites now'. The Blairite pundits Anthony Giddens and Will Hutton claim to be pro-market but anti-Thatcherite.<br /> In this book, they tell us how and why we must live with global capitalism. Hutton claimed that there is more class mobility in the USA than in Europe. Wrong - a study by economists Peter Gottschalk and Sheldon Danzinger showed that US workers had less class mobility than low-paid workers in European countries. Hutton predicted, \\"the German economy will start to pick up quite smartly.\\" Wrong - unemployment in Germany has now risen over four million. <br /> When the governors of Haringey's schools invited Hutton to put their case against a proposed Private Finance Initiative scheme, he helpfully declared that it was \\"the closest thing to a free lunch I have seen in 20 years of economic journalism.\\" Wrong - under the scheme, Haringey council was forced to agree to pay the building firm Jarvis an extra £2 million a year for the next 25 years. <br />Giddens believes that capitalism is `fairer than most socialists tended to assume'. Wrong - 86% of Wall Street's gains went to the richest 10% of the US population, and US Chief Executive Officers get on average 475 times what their blue-collar workers get. Poverty, he grandly proclaims, is no longer a condition, just the odd brief episode. Wrong - in Britain, three million old people live in poverty. And world-wide, 100 million more people now live in poverty than in 1990. He writes, \\"capitalism has buried the working class.\\" Wrong - world-wide, there are now more workers than ever before. <br />He says that the German government will have to reform its labour market and welfare system to make it more like the market, because \\"existing structures of the welfare state are no longer able to deliver\\". Wrong - relying on the stock market doesn't work: the average investing household in the USA, forced into gambling to fund their pensions, education for their children and health care, lost $45,000 after the 2000 crash wiped $2.2 billion off the Nasdaq (new technology) stock market. <br />Hutton and Giddens tell us that after the coal-based industrial revolution, then the oil-fired economy, we are now in the third revolution, the third way of the `knowledge-based', `weightless', `dematerialised' economy. Wrong - Britain's decline in manufacturing is not due to `a worldwide trend towards a services economy'. When, between 1973 and 1992 manufacturing output in Britain rose by just 1%, it rose by 25% in Germany, 27% in France, 85% in Italy and 119% in Japan.

Frank dissects the media, the political parties, the `think tanks' like Demos, and the public relations and management theory `industries', with their clowns like Tom Peters. He shows how the market, under the sign of democracy and choice, robs us of our basic freedoms, in the economic arena.<br />He shows us how the US economy `works': 86% of Wall Street's gains go to the richest 10% of the US population. In 1999, Chief Executive Officers got on average 475 times what their blue-collar workers got; the ratio was 11/1 in Japan and 24/1 in Britain. 40% of Internet firm executives had criminal records; they were experienced fraudsters and swindlers. The other 60% haven't got caught yet! Yet US workers had less social mobility than European workers.<br />... Capitalism does not provide: stocks and shares do not secure jobs, incomes, pensions, education, or health care.

President Bush launched the invasion `to restore democracy', after thirty years of supporting the drug-trafficking dictator General Noriega. As von Hippel writes, `the democracy excuse rang hollow'. 37% of the people are still below the poverty line. Its debt is 70% of its GDP. US troops are still there.<br />The US government intervened in Somalia in 1992-95 under what von Hippel calls `the humanitarian pretext'. The Security Council breached the UN Charter by authorising the intervention. Several thousand Somalis were killed. In the `Blackhawk down' incident in Mogadishu, 300 Somalis were killed and 700 wounded; 30% of the casualties were women and children. Intervention cost $4 billion, used 50,000 troops and worsened an already dire situation. The World Bank has no figures for the economy, but knows that the country owes exactly $2.3 billion.<br />Over Haiti, the Security Council again broke the UN Charter by sanctioning military intervention, for another `unique' situation `requiring an exceptional response'. Haiti was no threat to `international peace and security', so Cuba, Mexico, Uruguay and Venezuela opposed intervention. The CIA funded corrupt, drug-running fascist generals, which von Hippel calls `somewhat unpredictable and bizarre', despite noting the similarity with US support for Noriega. Structural Adjustment Programs and sanctions, as usual, worsened the country's problems, causing 60% unemployment. 80% of the rural population still live below the poverty line.<br />The US intervention in Bosnia has produced a military protectorate, with the economy destroyed. In 1997, Serbia's unemployment rate was 50% and in the Republic of Srpska, part of Bosnia, 90%.<br />Von Hippel notes that foreign aid and international charity cause aid dependency. In Somalia, for instance, foreign aid funded 70% of the national budget, before the collapse. She writes that aid \\"tends to enrich only the elite at the expense of the masses.\\"<br />Her accounts show that nations cannot be built from outside, especially not by US military intervention.gn aid and international charity cause aid dependency.

This book, based on a Journal of Strategic Studies special issue, usefully raises the question of what these dangers are. Henning Riecke points out that in 1993 the US government adopted a Defense Counterproliferation Initiative of three tiers: prevent a proliferation threat, deter it, and defend against it (meaning `preventive' war). NATO adopted this aggressive strategy in 1994.<br />John and Karl Mueller, in an excellent chapter, note that weapons of mass destruction (WMD) have killed about 300,000 people in all history - 100,000 in Japan, the rest in Europe in World War One and in China before World War Two. Yet NATO's economic sanctions against Iraq have killed about one million people and continue killing even \\"if Iraq complies with its obligations concerning weapons of mass destruction\\", as Albright said. Sanctions amount to killing the hostages without hurting their captor. Instead, the Muellers recommend containment and deterrence, which would reduce suffering while still preventing Iraq from starting a war.<br />All the writers agree that NATO is guilty of alarmism on WMD. Biological weapons are very hard to develop, deploy and control; they have killed very few people. Machine guns killed far more people on one day on the Somme than all biological weapons in history.<br />Chemical weapons are not unfailingly destructive. A 1993 analysis by the US Congress's Office of Technology Assessment found that a ton of Sarin nerve gas, perfectly delivered under absolutely ideal conditions over a heavily populated area against unprotected people, could cause between 3,000 and 8,000 deaths. When Iraq used gas against Iran, 262 died of the 27,000 gassed. When the terrorist group Aum Shinrikyo released Sarin in a Japanese subway in 1995, 12 died of the 1,000 affected.<br />The Western powers could effectively deter other states from using WMD, just as they deterred Iraq during the Gulf War. There is no need for `preventive' war. As this book proves, WMD use, not WMD possession, is dangerous. The threat is not from states developing WMD, but from NATO's possible reactions.he Gulf War.

Many of its contributors have shown great scholarship, imagination and independence of mind. May recalls that it has given us reviews of and by the 20th century's pre-eminent novelists writing in English, Henry James and Virginia Woolf. Recently it has opposed Critical Theory, and exposed the charlatans Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida.<br />But May also shows us the TLS's bad traits of `gossip and gentility', the baleful effects of Eton, Oxford and clubbable `literary London'. So it has all too often been a fashion victim, persistently overrating very minor novelists, like Kingsley Amis and George Orwell. May himself does not mention Tony Harrison, our greatest living poet, or Penelope Fitzgerald, possibly our finest recent novelist. The TLS also helped to inflate the reputations of idealist thinkers like Sigmund Freud, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Bertrand Russell, Karl Popper, Noam Chomsky, Terry Eagleton and Roger Scruton.<br />May, like many of his subjects, often uses words to avoid judgement, to veil, not reveal, reality. For instance, he notes of Paul de Man, the Yale Professor who founded `deconstructionism' in the USA, that some of his work was `judged to be fascist in character', but he does not explain why. De Man wrote 104 articles for pro-Nazi, anti-Semitic newspapers in Belgium during World War Two!<br />All too often the TLS propounded the conventional Cold War pieties, without seriously examining the rational kernel of Communism. Consequently, the study of literature substituted for intelligent politics; literary squabbles were given more attention than genuine conflicts of interest.<br />The TLS is now edited by Ferdinand Mount, \\"educated, like so many of the earlier figures on the Literary Supplement, at Eton and Christ Church.\\" He became the Daily Mail's chief leader writer, then head of Thatcher's Policy Unit, and more recently a political columnist on the Daily Telegraph.

But in giving such a full survey, Elliott, probably unintentionally, exposes Anderson as arrogant, dogmatic and, practically, useless.<br />For a Marxist, an understanding of class is basic. What is Anderson's idea of the working class? He assumes it is just the manual workers, not seeing that as capitalism has developed, it has needed growing numbers of white-collar workers to keep it going. Elliott explains, \\"Given that the proletariat was a social minority in most capitalist countries ... .\\"<br />This wrong premise, never argued, made room for the notion that this small weak working class needed a separate `socialist intelligentsia'. Its members were, according to Anderson, the `sources of consciousness in society' - workers are not even conscious! He concluded that the \\"party ... must include intellectuals and petit bourgeois who alone can provide the essential theory of socialism.\\" Workers need the `petit bourgeois' to teach them socialism!<br />How do we turn a minority revolutionary movement into a mass revolutionary movement? Anderson claims that only the development of revolutionary theory can move the class towards revolution, but that the absence of a mass movement prevents the emergence of this theory - an impasse. He adheres to Trotskyism, writing smugly in 1976, \\"the tradition descended from Trotsky ... filled no chairs in universities\\" - ironic now that he is Professor of History at the University of California.<br />Anderson believes that progress for Britain can only come from abroad - earlier, from Euro-Marxism, more recently, from the European Union. As he wrote in 1992, \\"a major task of the Left will be to press towards the completion of a genuine federal state in the Community, with a sovereign authority over its constituent parts.\\"<br />Anderson's ideas are the polar opposite of what Marxism should be: he is unrooted in, and hostile to, our trade union movement and to the British nation.

It presents a very detailed history of the city's troubled past and present.<br />Unhappy Palestine, so near to Europe, so dear to God! For millennia, three intolerant monotheisms have fought over the Holy Land, and the more religion has flourished, the less the chance of resolution. More recently, outside colonial forces, the Vatican particularly, have fomented trouble. As Lord Palmerston warned, \\"Religious protections pave the way for political dismemberments.\\" Nowadays, religious fanatics are a large part of the problem, whether ultra-Orthodox New York Jews creating illegal settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, or Hamas leaders promoting terror tactics against Israeli workers.<br />In June 1967, Israel seized and annexed east Jerusalem. In July, the UN General Assembly resolved that the Israeli government's measures there were invalid and called on it to rescind them. In May 1968 the Security Council made a similar Resolution; the US government abstained both times. The USA has consistently used its veto to support the Israeli government's building of illegal settlements.<br /> On 31 October 1995, an agreement was reached between Israel's Deputy Foreign Minister, Yossi Beilin, and a close colleague of Chairman Arafat, Abu Mazen. They agreed that there should be a Palestinian state within agreed boundaries, in which Israeli settlements would be dismantled, and to which Palestinian refugees would be allowed to return. Israel would recognise eastern Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine, and Palestine would recognise western Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. This is a far better basis for agreement than the 2000 Camp David offer, whereby Jerusalem was to be the `eternal and unified capital of Israel'.<br />The solution has to be in terms of two states, not the Bush-Sharon refusal ever to countenance an independent Palestine, nor (the mirror image) Hamas' refusal ever to recognise Israel.ent Palestine, nor (the mirror image) Hamas' refusal ever to recognise Israel.	2002-06-25

He covers the period from the late 18th century to the mid-20th, using their memoirs, and also surveys, opinion polls, school records and library registers.<br />A vast popular movement of voluntary collectivism created a hugely impressive working class culture - mutual improvement societies, Sunday schools, adult schools, libraries, reading circles, drama societies, musical groups, friendly societies, trade unions and mechanics' institutes. The London Corresponding Society, the world's first working class political organisation, met weekly; readings aloud provoked democratic discussion.<br />Education's purpose is to teach us to think for ourselves. The working class's self-improving culture encouraged them to ask questions and voice their thoughts and feelings. The great classics, Shakespeare (often described as the first Marxist), Handel's operas and Scott's novels, all stimulated thought, imagination and independence of mind.<br />Rose writes well about Marxists' problem of relating to workers. The class described in these pages, complex, thoughtful, independent-minded, savvy, resent being told what to think or what it thinks. This alone explains why there is, as yet, no mass British Marxism, not external influences, or the efficacy of ruling class institutions, or, the ultra-left dogma, misleadership - get the right cutting-edge vanguard and the dim masses will at last play follow the leader.<br />As Rose writes, \\"The trouble with Marx was Marxists, whom British workers generally found to be dogmatic, selfish, and antiliterary.\\" They dismissed the workers' hard-earned culture as bourgeois, and \\"they treated workers as unthinking objects.\\" Do we, now, tell them what to think? MPs and employers believe, \\"Ah'm paid ter do t'thinkin' `ere.\\" `Marxists' who repeat that approach will, rightly, get nowhere.<br />Ruskin wrote of those \\"whom the world has not thought of, far less heard of, who are yet doing most of its work, and of whom we can best learn how it can best be done.\\"  The working class will stick with capitalism until Marxists start to learn from them how the world's work `can best be done'.pproach will, rightly, get nowhere.<br />Ruskin wrote of those \\"whom the world has not thought of, far less heard of, who are yet doing most of its work, and of whom we can best learn how it can best be done.\\"  The working class will stick with capitalism until Marxists start to learn from them how the world's work `can best be done'.	2002-06-17

The book is written from the perspective of `Western security interests', but even so, studying strategy helps us to think clearly about the ways in which states and others use organised force for political ends.<br /> The writers all refute technological determinism: new weapons - artillery in World War One, tanks in World War Two, guided missiles in the Arab-Israeli war of 1973, precision bombing and superior ground force technology in the Gulf War - were none of them unbeatable. They show that the basic principles of conducting land warfare have hardly changed in the last hundred years. Armies need to combine their arms, defend in depth, keep large reserves, use cover and concealment, and integrate movement and suppressive fire. In particular, Stephen Biddle shows that, contrary to many claims, the USAF air war in the Gulf did not destroy all the Iraqi armour. Possibly 4,100 armoured vehicles later fought the US ground forces, but they did not fight according to the basic principles, so they were beaten.<br /> However, the editors err in dividing what they call `20th-century theories' - deterrence, arms control, terrorism and `irregular warfare' (national liberation struggles) - from the `contemporary issues' of technology, weapons of mass destruction, and humanitarian intervention. These are all still live issues. Further, the editors could have presented them in the livelier form of debates.<br /> As with any collection of pieces by many hands, the quality is uneven, but generally the better essays are more grounded in the realities of 20th-century military history. The worse ones try to discuss, for instance, the causes of war in terms of biology or psychology. As a rule, strikingly individual expressions of one person's views, like Colin Gray's Modern Strategy, or Bernard Brodie's War and Politics, provoke more thought than compilation textbookstegy, or Bernard Brodie's War and Politics, provoke more thought than compilation textbooks	2002-05-14

They tell us why the People's Republic of China decided to intervene in Korea, how the Chinese People's Volunteers Force was formed and mobilised politically, how it organised its strategy and tactics, how it was supplied, how it bought arms from the Soviet Union, how they saw their command experience, and finally how the truce was achieved.<br /> The PRC had warned the United Nations that she would not allow the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to be destroyed. The UN ignored the warning and on 7 October 1950, US troops invaded the DPRK, threatening both the DPRK and the PRC's northeastern frontiers. At this point, the US government believed that the war was won and that they had entered the `mopping up' phase (they recently believed the same of another land war in Asia, in Afghanistan earlier this year). The next day, the Chinese volunteer forces entered the war.<br />The UN forces fought a most brutal and dirty war against Korea. The United States Air Force dropped 7.8 million gallons of napalm on the country. US General Curtis LeMay boasted, \\"We burned down just about every city in North and South Korea both ... We killed over a million Koreans and drove several million more from their homes.\\" The American historian Bruce Cumings later wrote that this war \\"was the worst of American postwar interventions, the most destructive, far more genocidal than Vietnam.\\"<br />But the Korean and Chinese forces defeated the US plans to occupy all Korea, to invade the PRC and start World War Three.  The Volunteer Forces' forward defence of Manchuria successfully shielded it from attack and kept the war limited. Chinese forces inflicted upon American arms the most decisive defeat they suffered in the whole twentieth century. `Truman's war' became so unpopular in the USA that it led to the President's political demise. No wonder that George W. Bush fruitlessly wants to reverse this verdict.	2002-05-03

As early as 28 June 1950, its planes bombed roads, railways, industries and troops in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In September 1950, they bombed towns and cities in the People's Republic of China and in the Soviet Union.<br />Later on, President Eisenhower ordered the bombing of all the hydroelectric and irrigation dams in the DPRK &#64979; major war crimes. In spring 1953, he threatened to drop nuclear bombs, but the PRC and DPRK did not allow this to affect the peace talks. As in World War Two, the US leaders thought strategic bombing would make ground fighting unnecessary, but as usual, bombing was damaging not decisive.<br />The US and British governments had the gall to accuse the Communists of respecting no language but force, of having no respect for human life and of committing the most appalling atrocities. But these were all projections: whenever the Soviet Union and the PRC made diplomatic efforts to end the war, the western governments called this `Communist trickery'. US and South Korean soldiers slaughtered prisoners of war - 177 in one POW camp alone in 1952. They committed the most dreadful mass murders: after they entered the North, South Korean forces massacred 150,000 people. By contrast the Chinese forces behaved humanely, for example, as Hickey writes, \\"the Chinese never knowingly fired on the Red Cross flag, nor did they interfere with the work of the medical orderlies and bearers.\\"<br />As it became increasingly obvious that the US government could not win this war, it became more and more isolated. The American historian Burton Kaufman wrote that the US government finally \\"changed its stand on the armistice talks\\" and signed the Armistice in July 1953, only under the `unrelenting' pressure of its allies to end the war, backed by the `worldwide demand for compromise and peace in Korea'.its allies to end the war, backed by the `worldwide demand for compromise and peace in Korea'.	2002-05-01

Throughout the eurozone, growth is weak, unemployment high and rising, and investment stagnant. Yet society needs full employment: without it, we cannot end all its by-products, poverty, crime, corruption, bad health, illiteracy, lack of skills. When workers are in work, they can prevent all these evils.<br />Rosa shows that unemployment is high because macro-economic policy, not Browns micro, supply-side, fiddling, decides employment levels, and the European Union has the wrong macro policy. Euro-fundamentalists, including the Labour Government, cling to a fixed overvalued currency - pound or euro - cutting real wages, revenues and growth, and raising unemployment. The resulting excessive interest rates deflate the real economy of production and inflate the casino economy of speculation.<br />In the 1930s, France clung to the Gold Standard and suffered hugely; Britain floated the pound, and did better. In the 1990s, countries like Britain that left the ERM grew faster and had lower inflation than France, which stayed in.<br /> Capitalists argue that welfare spending and labour market inflexibility cause permanent structural unemployment, so you can only increase growth by raising unemployment enough to cut wages. Rosa demolishes this Eurosclerosis argument. He shows that in 1989, the last year before the Maastricht Treatys monetarism was imposed, the French economy grew by 4%, although welfare payments and the labour market stayed the same.<br /> We need a policy for growth, of floating exchange rates and cutting short-term interest rates down to zero. The OECD estimates that in France, for instance, cutting exchange rates would add 2% growth, and cutting 2% interest rates by 2% would add 0.5% growth, creating 320,000 jobs a year.<br />Rosa notes that the euro is Europes worst mistake since deflationary policy turned the 1929 crisis into a decade of depression. He stresses that the euros economic failings dont bother the EUs leaders, because they expressly conceived it as an economic way to lock us into the single European state, since they know they could never do it through winning our democratic consent.crisis into a decade of depression.

His politics are most ethical, he keeps telling us, and are based on two convictions, that we should be valued as individuals, and that this value is realised through community membership, ideas so banal that every MP could endorse them. The whole social democratic tradition, from Tawney to Crosland to Raymond Williams, tells us to live with capitalism, because we can get all we need while leaving private ownership intact. Let capital do what it likes, and the community will save us by picking up the pieces.<br />The whole book is shot through with wishful thinking, avoiding hard choices by using rhetoric. Private enterprise can secure full employment and egalitarian objectives, if we want it to. Labour is really `tackling gross inequalities of income', if we pretend hard enough.<br />Blunkett embraces multiculturalism, defends `faith schools', argues for granting refuge to all (!) that want it, and opposes assimilation into our common working class culture. These policies all conflict with the common citizenship that he urges.<br />He says that wrong ideas about aspirations and inequality, not the private sector and inadequate resources, undermine a decent education system. He advocates hiring foreign skilled workers on the cheap, ignoring that this robs other countries and undermines our efforts to improve skills and wages here.<br />He notices that Labour's constitutional `reforms', devolution and proportional representation, failed to increase voting, but can't see that this is because the reforms were not generated by democracy. He writes that Regional Assemblies are supposed to `provide legitimacy for decisions taken', but doesn't ask who takes these decisions. Not the people! Not even the Assemblies, but the EU! Where did these Assemblies and Regional Development Agencies come from? Not from popular demand; the EU imposed them.<br />He praises corporations, `whose contribution to social well-being through corporate social responsibility can be considerable', just after denying that governments defend big business!

They note that the OECD says that for the industrialised economies, the natural rate of unemployment, below which inflation will accelerate, is 11%. So for the Bank, \\"the focus of monetary policy becomes to ensure, in practice, that unemployment is sufficiently high to reduce price and wage increases.\\" The present level of unemployment across euroland is 11%, so this must be an EU success story: why aren't we applauding?<br />They show that Britain is not meeting the five tests. The EU's economies are diverging, as Wim Duisenberg has admitted. We have more economic flexibility than euroland does; investment into Britain is rising, the City of London is flourishing, and unemployment is lower than in euroland.<br />On the political side, many of the essays prove that the EU wants the euro to lock members forever into the planned EU state. German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said, \\"The introduction of the euro was not only the crowning-point of economic integration, it was also a profoundly political act, because a currency is not just another economic factor but also symbolises the power of the sovereign who guarantees it.\\"<br />And it would be a most undemocratic state, as even the Euro-fanatic Michael Heseltine admits: \\"The ... notable characteristic of present political arrangements is that they are about as ineffective and unaccountable as they could be ... the institutions themselves are totally incapable of adjusting to that change. We have federalism by stealth ...\\" Unaccountable, incorrigible, deceitful - he could be describing himself!

Kagarlitsky's book proves that workers cannot live under capitalism because it does not meet our needs. Stalin had found Russia a ruin and left it a great independent power. Gorbachev and Yeltsin found Russia a major power and left it in ruins: Kagarlitsky depicts this criminal and treasonous ruling class.<br />He shows capitalism's dire effects on Russia's economy, industry, the trade unions, the media, the intelligentsia, and systems of government. Capitalism ended full employment and free education and medical care. Between 1991 and 1998 overall production halved, and the population fell by 3.4 million.<br />He notes, \\"In the West, ... the bourgeoisie was being forced to wage a drawn-out positional war against the welfare state ... with the adoption of the Maastricht Accords, the advent of the euro and the establishing of a European Central Bank independent of the governments and the population.\\" These international monetarist bodies ordered privatisation, to breathe life into a dying system.<br />As in Britain, the Russian working class cannot avoid head-on assault by capitalist forces; if workers don't fight, we won't survive: we will have no pensions, no jobs, no NHS, no education, no housing, no law, no order. In Russia, Kagarlitsky warns us, \\"A shift to compulsory medical insurance ushered in the collapse of the entire health care system.\\"<br />He writes, \\"There is no capitalist solution to Russia's problems.\\" In fact, capitalism is the problem. He calls on Russia's workers to make a new revolution. They must find a new way of survival and work out how to run their country again. They have to restore their organisations and fight for democracy and sovereignty.<br />As Kagarlitsky writes, \\"The American Revolution showed that democracy and independence are interlinked in the closest possible fashion. The essence of them is that a country's fate is determined by its citizens alone, and not by a parliament in Westminster to which the inhabitants of Boston have not sent deputies, and not by the International Monetary Fund, whose policies are not formulated in Moscow.\\"itizens alone, and not by a parliament in Westminster to which the inhabitants of Boston have not sent deputies, and not by the International Monetary Fund, whose policies are not formulated in Moscow.\\"	2002-03-14

Innes' fascinating book seeks to explain why Czechoslovakia split into two states. She shows that whatever else caused the split, it was certainly not re-emergent nationalisms.<br /> The 1989 counter-revolution in Czechoslovakia had led, as counter-revolutions always do, to inflation, unemployment, declining living standards, a collapse in industrial output, worsening health and education systems, corruption and crime, but it had not caused hostilities between Czechs and Slovaks.<br />Indeed, in Czechoslovakia's June 1992 election, all parties, except the small Slovak National Party, opposed a split, but this election failed to turn public preferences into policy. Two weeks after the election, Vaclav Klaus, the Thatcherite Czech leader, and Vladimir Meciar, the Slovak leader, announced that Czechoslovakia was to be split. Meciar had promised a post-election referendum on the country's future, as required by the constitution, but none was held. President Vaclav Havel, the liberals' hero, failed to defend the constitution. Most of the Czechoslovakian people were opposed to splitting the state: only 16% wanted a split, but nonetheless the Czech working class feebly allowed Klaus and Meciar to split the state.<br />Innes concludes that the separation \\"was a process manufactured by a ruthlessly pragmatic Czech right, abetted, when push finally came to shove, by a populist and opportunist Slovak leadership.\\" \\"Czech and Slovak post-Communist politicians remained not only practically free from public constraint but also distinctly authoritarian in their attitudes towards the state and its purpose - not to mention spectacularly deceitful to their electorates.\\"<br />Significantly though, Innes does not mention the roles of the EU or of the German Government, which has always wanted to destroy a united Czechoslovakia, although she notes in passing that the Czech Republic has subsequently `become a German peninsula'. (Investigating Helmut Kohl's notorious secret funds, and Klaus and Meciar's bank accounts, could be useful.)

We gave Railtrack £1000 million a year, £350 million of which it gave to its shareholders. It collapsed last October owing £1.8 billion to subcontractors and £700 million in bills and interest payments to bondholders and banks. The directors of the rail firms prioritised their shareholders&#8217; interests over trivia like safety and public service. They cut costs by sacking maintenance workers &#8211; there were 31,000 in 1994, only 19,000 in 2000. Rolling stock, track and signalling equipment are all in a far worse state than under investment-starved British Rail.<br />One caveat: Murray claims that the EU had nothing to do with the privatisation. But EU Regulation EC91/440 ordered that management and financing of track and train services be separate, run on strictly commercial lines and be totally independent of the state. The Commission wants to open up all public services likewise. (See its report COM (2000) 580, &#8216;Services of a General Interest&#8217;.)<br />This government, like its predecessor, opposes introducing the best Automatic Train Protection system, first recommended in 1988, because it would cost too much. We have the world&#8217;s highest standard rail fares: fares on the London-Manchester route &#8211; a Virgin Trains monopoly &#8211;have risen by 50% since 2000.<br />Tested in practice, privatisation has failed to produce a safer, more reliable and more punctual service. The government&#8217;s response? Introduce the same failed system into London Underground, education and the National Health Service. Don&#8217;t Labour&#8217;s focus groups ever include any of the 76% of us who want rail renationalised? Or the 89% who oppose handing public services over to private firms? Why doesn&#8217;t the government just renationalise rail? Because it is not democratic: it is totally beholden to private finance.<br />Under PFI, sorry, PPP, firms would be borrowing the money: why not let the public sector do that itself? And we could build the trains and rolling stock we need at Derby, York and Birmingham. We want a publicly run, democratically accountable, integrated railway, instead of the 100-piece, privatised anarchy we now endure.ic: it is totally beholden to private finance. <br />Under PFI, sorry, PPP, firms would be borrowing the money: why not let the public sector do that itself?

Yet Gray never forgets that practice is primary, noting the `authority of practice over theory'.<br />He uses Clausewitz's method, defining strategy as `the use that is made of force and the threat of force for the ends of policy': it is about objectives, effects. The nature and function of strategy and war are unchanging, though their characters change constantly. \\"Every war is both unique yet also similar to other wars.\\" Strategy is in every conflict everywhere.<br />Tactics, by contrast, is the use of instruments of power in action. Strategy proposes; tactics dispose. \\"War is not `about' economics, morality, or fighting. Instead, it is about politics.\\"<br />Strategy's dimension are politics, ethics, military preparations, people, technology, time, war proper. Technological changes alter the character not the nature of war: \\"Technology is important, but in war and strategy people matter most.\\"<br />Gray analyses strategy's components, its various environments, land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace. Seapower, airpower and spacepower function strategically as enabling factors: a war's outcome may be decided by action at sea, in the air or in space, but all conflicts have to be finally resolved on land, where people are.<br /><br />He illuminates wars from the Punic to the Boer, but focuses mainly on the 20th century's excessive amount of war experience: wars between empires, still all too possible, and wars against nations, opposed by wars for national liberation and independence. He writes, \\"how truly heroic is Mao's message of eventual success through the conduct of protracted revolutionary warfare.\\" Success can mean just stopping the enemy from winning.<br />We can check the quality of his approach by assessing the strategic conclusions it generates, despite his overmuch reliance on histories emanating from State Department and Foreign Office. He shows that bombing Germany before defeating the Luftwaffe was a costly error. He proves that the atomic bomb did not defeat Japan in 1945; Japan was already defeated.

When the ECB's Chief Economist, Otmar Issing, wrote a book on the Bank's monetary policy, he made no mention at all of the policy's impact on jobs or industry.  He larded the book with praise for the monetarist economist Milton Friedman, whose well-known and disastrous impact on Chile's economy was, oddly, not referred to in the book.<br />Thatcher's monetarist fallacy was that the battle against inflation was the overriding economic aim, because low or zero inflation would produce higher growth.  But in the real world, other things being equal, low inflation was not the cause of high growth but the effect of low growth, and high inflation was not the cause of low growth but the effect of high growth.  Monetarism's battle against inflation was a policy of deflation, forcing unemployment and low wages on the working class. So, just as Thatcher therefore became the deadly enemy of the working class, so now joining the euro has become the main threat to us.	2002-02-04

Since 1990, Kazakh workers' rights to jobs, wages, welfare, free education, pensions and savings, have all been ripped away. Their access to cheap housing, electricity, gas, phones, transport, health care, childcare, sport, arts, libraries, have all gone. In the 1980s and 1990s, active NATO and IMF interventions enforced capitalism in Kazakhstan, grabbing oil, gas and metals for firms like Shell and British Gas. 15% of foreign investment is British, 23% South Korean, 29% US. Theft of public property through privatisation has closed factories and destroyed jobs: engineering and agricultural outputs both halved between 1995 and 1998.<br />This is what happens when the working class lets go of its controls over society, its party and trade unions.<br />As a young Kazakh woman said, \\"Before, in the Soviet time, there were moral limits and the authorities looked after them. There were high moral standards ... People were truthful. They were brought up in a good way. But today people have become like savage animals. They behave according to the law of the jungle.\\"<br />Now violent and corrupt mafiosi, newly freed, traffic in drugs and sex, and become the new rich, while for the workers, there is only loss, insecurity, growing ethnic and gender tensions and huge growths in poverty and migration. Capital goes global; workers are ghettoised. The workers rightly see all these evils as resulting from the infliction of capitalism. Nazpary notes the very strong `Soviet patriotism' among the mass of the people, while the new rich view the Soviet era only as tyranny. He details the networking of family and friends in the scrabble for scarce goods, but as he notes, \\"tragically and paradoxically, networking as a response to the chaos perpetuates it.\\"<br />In the FSU as whole, an estimated 4.7 million more people have died since 1990 as a direct result of the counter-revolution. As world capitalism, unrestrained by the USSR's existence, grows more brutal and corrupt, Kazakhstan is just one instance of problems common to workers across the world.<br />Kazakhstan's workers need to make a new revolution., unrestrained by the USSR's existence, grows more brutal and corrupt, Kazakhstan is just one instance of problems common to workers across the world. <br />Kazakhstan's workers need to make a new revolution.	2002-01-02

This extremely useful book presents hundreds of newly declassified US Government documents detailing this psywar.<br />The US Joint Chiefs of Staff defined psywar as \\"Planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, or individuals.\\" But the US state also targeted the American people. The campaign included rumour campaigns, posters, newspapers, books, comics, newsreels, leaflet drops, forgeries and radio and TV broadcasts. The usual US Government message was `Castro betrayed the revolution'.<br />In March 1960, President Eisenhower approved a plan to overthrow Cuba's Government `in such a manner as to avoid any appearance of US intervention.' Government representatives would describe any `alleged CIA personnel' as `soldiers of fortune working on their own'. The attack was based on `the Guatemala scenario' when the CIA overthrew Arbenz's democratically elected Government in 1954.<br />The American people opposed a US armed intervention in Cuba by 65-24%. Nonetheless in November President Kennedy approved the attack, the `top priority in the US government'. Jacqueline Kennedy visited refugee camps `to demonstrate concern for civilian refugees, particularly parentless children'.<br />The Joint Chiefs of Staff produced a paper bluntly titled `Pretexts to Justify United States Military Intervention in Cuba'. They planned a fabricated attack on the Guantanamo Bay base (like a fake attack triggering the invasion of Yugoslavia?). Also, \\"We could sink a boatload of Cubans enroute to Florida.\\" We could \\"create an incident which will demonstrate convincingly that a Cuban aircraft has attacked and shot down a chartered civilian airliner enroute from the United States.\\" In response, Cuba accepted Soviet weapons to defend itself; which Kennedy unblushingly called `offensive'.<br />The US Government now uses these methods all over the world: never believe anything it, or NATO, says!ons to defend itself; which Kennedy unblushingly called `offensive'.<br />The US Government now uses these methods all over the world: never believe anything it, or NATO, says!	2001-11-01

In the 1920s and 1930s the conventional means of controlling the British Empire's unwilling subjects were proving too expensive. The Empire's rulers wanted to cut their costs and increase their profits from Empire. British workers on the other hand were increasingly reluctant to carry the burden of Empire, either with their lives or with their taxes. So the rulers tried the experiment of using planes rather than troops to repress dissent. The principal victims of this experiment were the peoples of Iraq, Palestine and Sudan.<br />The rulers of course claimed that these new methods would be less barbarous than the traditional Army methods of `Butcher and bolt'. But this is doubtful in view of, for instance, the orders given by RAF officers operating in Iraq in 1920: \\"Villages will be razed to the ground and all woodwork removed. Pressure will be brought on the inhabitants by cutting off water power and destroying water lifts; efforts to carry out cultivation will be interfered with, and the systematic collection of supplies of all kinds beyond our actual requirements will be carried out, the area being cleared of the necessaries of life.\\"  In 1921 another RAF officer reported of one operation, \\"the tribesmen and their families ran into the lake, making a good target for the machineguns.\\"  These war crimes were neither punished nor publicly reported.<br />The inhuman, barbaric nature of colonial rule was revealed by Lord Trenchard, Chief of the Air Staff from 1919 to 1929, when he fatuously told the House of Lords in April 1930 that tribesmen \\"have no objection to being killed.\\"<br /><br />The British Empire pioneered most of the methods of barbarism that it now stalely denounces, possibly the most notorious being the invention of concentration camps in the Boer War. The destruction of homes, crops and water supplies were routine Imperial operations. It pioneered atrocities now routinely denounced as terrorist methods, for example, \\"delayed action-bombs became a standard weapon of air-policing.\\"  These were used especially in Iraq.<br />The indiscriminate bombing of civilian men, women and children was also an Imperial idea. Naturally this could not be admitted so the myth of `surgical air strikes', so often invoked by the USA, was first used by Britain's Air Ministry in the 1920s. The notorious `Bomber' Harris, whose mass murder of German civilians did so little to end the Second World War, learnt his inhuman and sadistic approach in Iraq and Palestine.<br />All in all, this book is a blunt and effective denunciation of the methods of control used by the British ruling class in its unavailing attempts to subdue the peoples of other countries.terrorist methods, for example, \\"delayed action-bombs became a standard weapon of air-policing.\\"  These were used especially in Iraq.<br />The indiscriminate bombing of civilian men, women and children was also an Imperial idea.

The Balkan peoples were unfortunate enough to be on the fault line between two empires. The Military Frontier between Austria and Turkey also divided two faiths, Catholic and Islam.  Just as volcanoes erupt where tectonic plates grind together, so wars are generated by the clash of empires, and the struggles of the peoples there for national liberation. The Serbs fought for their national liberation from Ottoman rule until they won their independence.<br />But when Judah comes to the 20th century, his book mirrors the Serbs' history all too faithfully. Like them, he underestimates the role of economic forces and overestimates the role of a narrowly nationalist ideology. His is a political history in the narrow sense: he blames the start of the war on Serbia's bad leaders. He does not mention the roles of supranational organisations like the European Union and the International Monetary Fund in fomenting the war.<br />Tito's Government foolishly borrowed heavily from Western banks: by the 1980s, Yugoslavia had more debt relative to income than any country in Europe. In 1983, Yugoslavia allowed the IMFto slash social services and programmes of regional redistribution. The standard of living plummeted, and unemployment soared to 50% in Kosovo and to over 20% in Serbia, Bosnia, Montenegro and Macedonia. In 1989, wages were cut by 20% and gross national product fell by 8.5%.<br />In 1935, Stalin and the Comintern had advocated Yugoslavian unity and said that the party should openly oppose separatism. Rejecting this advice, Tito created a federal Constitution; later, he gave the republics increased doses of autonomy. This rolling devolution played into the hands of the separatists, who put presumed local interests before the interests of the country as a whole.<br />Judah writes, \\"The west had turned a blind eye to the arming of Croatia and actively encouraged the clandestine arming of Bosnia, both in contravention of the UN arms embargo on former Yugoslavia. Retired American officers, with official US backing, had also been training the Croatian Army.\\" Warren Christopher, the US Secretary of State, admitted later about the Croatian attack on Krajina, \\"We did not think that kind of attack could do anything other than create a lot of refugees and cause a humanitarian problem.

Cornwell shows how Pius always took a dogmatic approach to matters spiritual, an autocratic approach to matters ecclesiastical and a reactionary approach to matters temporal.  In 1924, Pius XI (1922-39) forbade the Catholic Popular Party to work with the Socialist Party against Mussolini, saying it would be cooperating with evil. Later Pius dissolved the Catholic Popular Party and encouraged priests to support the Fascists. In 1930 he pressed Germany's Catholic Centre Party to shun the Social Democratic Party and to court Hitler. Pacelli was Cardinal Secretary of State in the Vatican from 1930 to 1934, second only to the Pope. He signed a concordat with Hitler in 1933, protecting the Catholic Church's power in exchange for its `non-intervention' in politics. Hitler said, \\"The concordat gave Germany an opportunity and created a sense of trust that was particularly significant in the developing struggle against international Jewry.\\" It \\"imposed a moral duty on Catholics to obey the Nazi rulers.\\" Cornwell writes, \\"the perception of Papal endorsement of Nazism, in Germany and abroad, helped seal the fate of Europe.\\" (Compare the Church's \\"antagonistic confrontation with Communism both in Italy and beyond the Iron Curtain.\\") The concordat led the Catholic Centre Party, the last remaining democratic party in Germany, to back the 1933 Enabling Act giving Hitler dictatorial powers, and to disband itself voluntarily in 1938.  During the war, the Pope muttered only the most vague and ambiguous remarks about the Nazis' atrocities, the killing of millions of Soviet prisoners of war, the killing of six million Jews. He also kept discreetly silent about the Croat atrocities under Ante Pavelic. On 3 October 1998, Pope John Paul II beatified Archbishop Stepinac who had called on the faithful to collaborate with Pavelic. This Pope also seeks to make a saint of Pius XII.  He follows Pius' traditions of dogmatism, autocracy and reaction.

Like all serious studies, it shows that the wars were not the result of ethnic differences. There are no ethnic differences among the Slavs who make up Yugoslavia. Serbs, Croats and Muslims are not separate nations: they are all Slavs.<br />But why then did this ghastly conflict suddenly erupt when it did? To answer this question, we have to look at Yugoslavia's economic record. In the late 1980s, Yugoslavia suffered a massive economic crisis.<br />From its inception in 1945, Tito's Government had tried to integrate Yugoslavia into the capitalist system, receiving credits from the US Government. In 1960, the Yugoslav Government gave up the state monopoly of foreign trade; this meant that it could not protect the country's infant industries. It borrowed heavily from Western banks: the resulting debt payments absorbed 30 per cent of export earnings.<br />By the 1980s, Yugoslavia had the highest level of debt to national income of any country in Europe. The EC and the banks rejected the Yugoslav Government's requests for help with rescheduling their debts.  They demanded that the debts be paid, whatever the cost. The ever-increasing debt burden caused economic disaster. Yugoslavia's economy suffered a catastrophic collapse, which led to a social breakdown.<br />Susan Woodward's book, The Balkan Tragedy: Chaos and dissolution after the Cold War, (Brookings Institution, 1995), &quot;The conflict ... is the result of the politics of transforming a socialist society to a market economy and democracy. A critical element of this failure was economic decline, caused largely by a program intended to resolve a foreign debt crisis. More than a decade of austerity and declining living standards corroded the social fabric and the rights and securities that individuals and families had come to rely on.&quot; West's book, like the Guardian/Channel 4 book, Bloody Bosnia, ignores this economic disaster.<br />  In 1983, Yugoslavia placed itself in the International Monetary Fund's hands. The IMF imposed economic measures that as usual worsened the problems. It insisted on cuts in the universal social services and in the programmes that to some extent redistributed wealth to the less developed regions. Devolution of power to the regions also undercut the economic integration so vital to building a united nation.<br />Yugoslavia stopped being a single market: the South of Yugoslavia lost its Northern markets for primary products. Only a third of its national output and 20 per cent of its capital movements circulated between the regions. This, incidentally, shows how important it is that Britain's workers reintegrate England, Scotland and Wales economically, even under capitalism, to prevent further economic decline.<br />Between 1980 and 1984, Yugoslavia's standard of living fell by 30 per cent, and unemployment rose to 15 per cent. By 1989, Kosovo's unemployment rate was 50 per cent; in the southern regions, Serbia, Bosnia, Montenegro and Macedonia, it was between 20 and 30 per cent.<br />West sheds light on the origins of the wars in Yugoslavia. He shows that it is wrong to blame the whole disaster on Serbian aggression, or indeed on Croat fascism or on Bosnian fundamentalism.<br />From a 'Right-wing' perspective, West argues, wrongly, that any attempt to build a self-reliant economy must end in disaster. He argues that only international capitalism can bring peace. But the Yugoslav government, as we have seen, relied increasingly on capitalism, creating rivalry between regions and enterprises. This deepened regional inequalities, and increased the pressures towards devolution and break-up. The government imported goods that Yugoslavs could have produced themselves; this created huge debts and increased unemployment.<br />The people of Yugoslavia, like those of other countries, will have to take responsibility for rebuilding their country. This is a process in which outside forces will have no part.side forces will have no part.	2001-08-05

It also studies the media coverage of the war. The first part consists of four essays on the background to the war, David Chandler's essay, Western intervention and the disintegration of Yugoslavia, 1989-1999, being outstanding. The second and third parts comprise fourteen essays on media coverage around the world, including a brilliant essay on CNN's role as NATO's mouthpiece. Unfortunately, however, there is no essay studying the huge popular opposition to the war in Europe and America.<br />This was NATO's first war, and it attacked a sovereign country with no UN authorisation. It showed itself as an alliance with no legal or geographic limits, in which the USA and Germany quarrelled like rats in a sack. To trigger the war, the US government demanded that NATO forces occupy the whole country. As a US official said, \\"We intentionally set the bar too high for the Serbs to comply. They need some bombing, and that's what they are going to get.\\"<br /> It was also the EU's war. From 1990, the EC intervened in Yugoslavia's internal affairs, aiding those seeking to secede. Its recognition of Yugoslavia's seceding republics breached international law, precipitating war. The EU's social democratic governments embrace capital, `the market' and big business: their enemy is nationalism, politics, demonised as the source of all evil.<br />Germany, the USA, Austria and Albania armed the Kosovo Liberation Army. In early 1998, the KLA's first major attack provoked a Serb crackdown. NATO claimed that the Serbs killed 100,000 people. Later the International Criminal Tribunal of The Hague counted 2,500 dead. The NATO bombing killed 2,600 people. Who should be tried for war crimes?<br /> After the war, the US Congress voted $100 million to `independent' forces in former Yugoslavia, seeking its further disintegration.

The League of Communists of Yugoslavia (LCY) consistently, and mistakenly, recognised no less than six South Slav `nations' as constituting Yugoslavia. These were Serbs, Montenegrins, Macedonians, Slovenes, Muslims and Croats.<br />Ironically, the LCY failed to recognise Yugoslavs as a nation! Further, Muslims do not constitute a nation: Islam is a religion, and no more. Serbs, Montenegrins, Bosnians and Croats are identical in ethnic and linguistic origins. Macedonians and Slovenes have their own languages, but also have the identical ethnic origin. All are South Slavs (`Yugoslavia' means the land of the South Slavs); they are all members of a nation very different in history and experience from any of its neighbours. But in the 1981 census only five per cent of the population called themselves Yugoslavs.<br />In 1918, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was created, from the ruins of the Habsburg Empire. In 1919, the first Yugoslav Communist Congress called for a unified Yugoslavia, and created a party. But in the mid-1920s, the party decided to recognise the right of the country's nations to self-determination and to support the creation of separate states. This meant opposing the unity of all the country's workers. (Unfortunately, there is no word in the book about the forms of trade union organisation in Yugoslavia, which would have revealed much about the practice and prospects of national unity.)<br />In 1935, the party demanded separate Parliaments and started to form separate communist parties. Against this, Stalin and the Comintern refused to advocate Yugoslavia's dissolution and said that the party should openly oppose separatism. They argued that only revolution could save Yugoslavia's unity.<br />During World War Two, the Axis powers divided Yugoslavia and proclaimed their intention never to let it reunite. They made Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina into a puppet state, and gave power to the Croat Ustashas, who massacred hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Jews and gypsies, the worst violence in Yugoslav history. In the war, the party led the all-Yugoslav resistance movement and army, but after the war it created a federal structure for the country, which was a step backward.<br />The 1953 Constitution described a single Yugoslav working class, but devolution of power to the regions undercut the economic integration so vital to building a united class and nation. This decentralisation strengthened the bourgeois forces pressing first for devolution and then for separation, and hastened Yugoslavia's breakup.<br />In sum, the LCY was a party committed to its own breakup into separate `national' parties, and to the nation's breakup into separate nation states. Obviously, it could not hold either itself or the country together for long.<br />  This book illustrates the hard truth that without a nation of its own, the working class has nothing.

He believes that it is now exhausted, and laments that the vacuum is being filled by what he thinks are the dead ends of New Genetics, epidemiology and social medicine. It is untimely to write off genetics when the Human Genome Project offers such exciting possibilities.<br />He calls for more research into the causes of disease, and rightly rejects idealist explanations. Doctors used to think that peptic ulcers were due to `stress' or `personality', but in 1984, Barry Marshall, a young Australian doctor, identified a type of bacterium that triggered them. A seven-day course of antibiotics was the cure. The same organism caused two-thirds of stomach cancer cases. In 1986, Thomas Grayston discovered that the bacterium chlamydia caused heart disease. Perhaps as yet undiscovered bacteria cause arthritis, schizophrenia, leukaemia, MS, diabetes and ME.<br />He has a brilliant chapter on how the use of new drugs refuted Freudianism, as chlorpromazine effectively relieved schizophrenia's symptoms, lithium mania's, prozac depression's and valium anxiety's.<br />Le Fanu shows that the influential historian of medicine Thomas McKeown wrongly denied doctors the credit for tuberculosis's decline. Doctors' seclusion of TB patients in sanatoria dramatically reduced the infection's incidence.<br />He argues against social medicine, rejecting all social and economic explanations of illness. But lifestyle changes - losing weight, improving diet and exercising more - do prevent diabetes and promote health and well-being (British Medical Journal, 14 July 2001, page 63.)<br />He claims that medicine has run its course.

It was surrounded by enemies, who had allies inside the country, even inside the Party: Trotsky's provocations invited imperialist aggression; Bukharin's efforts to prevent industrialisation and collectivisation would have left the Soviet Union defenceless against the Nazi onslaught. After World War Two, the Soviet leadership had the sheer courage to rebuild the country, and also to create and aid new socialist societies, in the teeth of the US nuclear monopoly.<br />  This book expresses the British Foreign Office's view of the Soviet Union. For, after Yugoslavia won its independence in 1945, with the Red Army's aid, Tito became increasingly anti-Soviet, thus gaining US and British support. The book depicts Tito as Bevin did, saying in 1949, \\"He's a ..., but he's our ....\\" The British and US Governments 'kept Tito afloat' with financial aid. The US National Security Council believed that \\"much as we dislike him, Tito is presently performing brilliantly in our interests in leading successfully and effectively the attack from within the Communist family against Soviet imperialism.\\" (cited p. 300)<br />The British Government told Tito that they would stop aiding Yugoslavia unless he stopped aiding the Greek revolution: Tito closed the border, trapping half the Greek Liberation Army inside Yugoslavia. Tito's colleagues Dedijer and Djilas slandered Stalin, claiming that he told Tito to stop the aid. Yugoslavia abstained on the UN Security Council vote to send troops to invade Korea and on the UN General Assembly Resolution that falsely branded the People's Republic of China the aggressor in Korea. The NATO powers told Tito to establish friendly relations with the ... Greek Government, which he did. In 1954, he signed a defence pact with Greece and Turkey.<br />  Inside Yugoslavia, Tito increasingly favoured the free market, and he gave its six republics more and more autonomy. In 1963, he created a federal Constitution; in 1970, he gave the republics even more autonomy, and, in the 1974 Constitution, he gave them almost complete autonomy.  This successive yielding to devolutionary pressures gave more power and more credibility to those who sought to break away from Yugoslavia.

In the late 1980s, Yugoslavia suffered a massive economic crisis.<br />From its inception in 1945, Tito's Government had tried to integrate Yugoslavia into the capitalist system, receiving credits from the US Government. In 1960, the Yugoslav Government gave up the state monopoly of foreign trade; this meant that it could not protect the country's infant industries. It borrowed heavily from Western banks: the resulting debt payments absorbed 30 per cent of export earnings.<br />By the 1980s, Yugoslavia had the highest level of debt to national income of any country in Europe. The EC and the banks rejected the Yugoslav Government's requests for help with rescheduling their debts.  They demanded that the debts be paid, whatever the cost. The ever-increasing debt burden caused economic disaster. Yugoslavia's economy suffered a catastrophic collapse, which led to a social breakdown.<br />Barratt Brown quotes Susan Woodward's book, The Balkan Tragedy: Chaos and dissolution after the Cold War, (Brookings Institution, 1995), &quot;The conflict ... is the result of the politics of transforming a socialist society to a market economy and democracy. A critical element of this failure was economic decline, caused largely by a program intended to resolve a foreign debt crisis. More than a decade of austerity and declining living standards corroded the social fabric and the rights and securities that individuals and families had come to rely on.&quot; The Guardian/Channel 4 book, Bloody Bosnia, ignores this economic disaster.<br />  In 1983, Yugoslavia placed itself in the International Monetary Fund's hands. The IMF imposed economic measures that as usual worsened the problems. It insisted on cuts in the universal social services and in the programmes which to some extent redistributed wealth to the less developed regions. Devolution of power to the regions also undercut the economic integration so vital to building a united nation.<br />Yugoslavia stopped being a single market: the South of Yugoslavia lost its Northern markets for primary products. Only a third of its national output and 20 per cent of its capital movements circulated between the regions. This, incidentally, shows how important it is that Britain's workers reintegrate England, Scotland and Wales economically, even under capitalism, to prevent further economic decline.<br />Between 1980 and 1984, Yugoslavia's standard of living fell by 30 per cent, and unemployment rose to 15 per cent. By 1989, Kosovo's unemployment rate was 50 per cent; in the southern regions, Serbia, Bosnia, Montenegro and Macedonia, it was between 20 and 30 per cent.<br />This book shed light on the origins of the war in Yugoslavia. It shows that it is wrong to blame the whole disaster on Serbian aggression, or indeed on Croat fascism or on Bosnian fundamentalism. But if nationalism is not to blame for the war, why does Barratt-Brown maintain that his book's central theme is to 'condemn all forms of nationalism'? Surely, his economic analysis has shown that capitalism, not nationalism, is to blame for the war.<br />From a Left' perspective, he argues, wrongly, that any attempt to build a self-reliant economy must end in disaster, and that only a federal, capitalist, Europe can prevent wars. But the Yugoslav government, as we have seen, relied increasingly on capitalism, creating rivalry between regions and enterprises. This deepened regional inequalities, and increased the pressures towards devolution and breakup. The government imported goods that Yugoslavs could have produced themselves; this created huge debts and increased unemployment.<br />The people of Yugoslavia, like those of other countries, will have to take responsibility for rebuilding their country. This is a process in which outside forces will have no part.ted goods that Yugoslavs could have produced themselves; this created huge debts and increased unemployment.<br />The people of Yugoslavia, like those of other countries, will have to take responsibility for rebuilding their country.

'International History Review' said of the first edition that it was &quot;far superior in its factual coverage and balance to its various competitors in the field. .. He has told the story as completely and as impartially as we are liable to get.&quot; Cohen gives a brief history of Yugoslavia in the first chapter. The rest of the book gives a detailed account of Yugoslavia's breakup and the war.<br />Yugoslavia existed as a state from 1918 to 1991. Under Tito it had a devolved and federal constitution. This gave parity representation to each of the six republics in the Yugoslav federation, even though Serbia was by far the biggest. Tito selected people for jobs by 'ethnic arithmetic' and rotated top officials annually. But these policies signally failed to unify Yugoslavia. The constitution encouraged those who wanted to split the country. They had a two-track strategy. They aimed to move from federation to confederation as a step towards independence; at the same time they formed separate institutions designed for complete independence.<br />Outside forces seized on these internal failings. In January 1991 the US and German Ambassadors pressed the Yugoslav National Army not to intervene to keep Croatia in Yugoslavia. In early 1991 Germany and other countries sold arms to Croatia and Slovenia. On 25 June 1991 Croatia and Slovenia unilaterally declared their independence. The Croats were desperate for foreign intervention: &quot;The Tudjman government believed that immediate internationalization of the Yugoslav crisis was absolutely crucial.&quot;<br />  When the Yugoslav Government deployed the National Army to hold the country together, the EC secretly threatened to cut off all aid to Yugoslavia. On 4 October 1991, the opening day of the EC Conference, its chairman Lord Carrington presented an agenda &quot;premised on the assumption that Yugoslavia no longer existed.&quot; The EC announced that all the Yugoslav republics &quot;are sovereign and independent with international identity&quot;. As Cohen wrote, &quot;the EC had apparently made a political decision to dismember the Yugoslav federation.&quot; Hurd warned in December 1991 that recognising Croatia and Slovenia would escalate the war. Carrington warned that recognition would weaken diplomatic efforts to achieve a ceasefire and a settlement, and would also spread the war to Bosnia. Despite, or because of, all these good reasons, the EC, including Britain, recognised Croatia and Slovenia in January. The UN did too, despite its &quot;internal divisions about the propriety of intervention in a sovereign state's domestic disputes.&quot;<br />The war did spread to Bosnia. In July 1991 the Moslem Bosnian Organization tried to negotiate a Moslem-Serb accord to prevent war in Bosnia and to preserve Bosnia's territorial integrity. Karadzic accepted this for the Bosnian Serbs, but Izetbegovic, the leader of the Bosnian Muslims, rejected it. Izetbegovic is a member of the fundamentalist 'Fida'iyane Islam', which wants to turn Bosnia into an Islamic Republic, although Muslims are only a third of the population. Bosnia's Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic tried to justify the composition of his government by saying &quot;It is a fact that Moslems make up 99% of the Bosnian defense forces so it is natural that they form the government.&quot; In so doing he gave the lie to the nonsense that Bosnia is some form of multicultural democracy. These armed forces have been &quot;strengthened with thousands of volunteers from various Islamic countries&quot; and by illegal arms shipments, often through Slovenia, especially from Iran, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.<br />In his 1970 Islamic Declaration, which he reprinted in 1990, Izetbegovic wrote, &quot;The Islamic movement must and can take power not only to destroy the non-Islamic power but to build up a new Islamic one.&quot; Cohen noted &quot;the more militant and religiously nationalistic majority in the party led by Alija Izetbegovic (who had spent eight years in jail under the communists for his Islamic fundamentalist beliefs).&quot; Cohen analysed &quot;the role of traditional religions in generating ethnic conflicts&quot; in Yugoslavia.<br />  Again, in February 1992 Izetbegovic sabotaged the Lisbon Agreement for Moslem-Serb-Croat power-sharing. He &quot;later conceded that Bosnia might have avoided a violent war if it had stayed together with Serbia and Montenegro in a reconfigured Yugoslavia.&quot; In early 1992 his dash for Bosnian independence was &quot;prompted by the opportunity for quick recognition by the EC.&quot; Even the US Ambassador to Yugoslavia called his decision 'disastrous'. Cohen pointed out that &quot;the lack of a political settlement among the major ethnic groups within Bosnia-Herzegovina actually justified postponing recognition of that republic as another new state in April 1992.&quot; But the EC and the UN went ahead with recognition. In the autumn of 1993 Bosnian Moslem government forces killed &quot;thousands of civilian Croats in central Bosnia&quot;.<br />The United States has throughout the war campaigned for US intervention. As Cohen pointed out, it used hyperbolic calls of genocide to try to justify intervention. It has vilified the Serbs and whitewashed the Bosnian Moslems and the Croats. To defeat the Serbs, &quot;the United States, though not ostensibly taking sides in the war, had effectively engineered the Moslem-Croat agreement.\\" Cohen showed how &quot;behind the scenes, Washington was gradually expanding its military support for the Moslems and Croats&quot;. Clinton approved the initiative of a group of former US military officers to assist Croatia's armed forces.<br />  Cohen finished by writing hopefully, &quot;The imperatives of economic survival and reconstruction, as well as geographic proximity and other earlier interdependencies, suggested that such cooperation would eventually resume despite the recent episodes of terrible, ethnic, religious, and political violence.&quot; But there is no chance of this vital peaceful reconstruction happening with 60,000 foreign troops in the country.

Loren Baritz's excellent book Backfire: a history of how American culture led us into Vietnam and made us fight the way we did, (Morrow, 1985) presents the US Government's pattern of thought, in some detail.  The McGeorge Bundy report of February 1965 \\"concluded by informing the president that if he kept his focus on what the NLF was doing in the South as the cause of our bombing in the north, the world's criticism of the bombing could be dealt with. If the American players would continually emphasize the atrocities of the guerrillas, `the international pressures for negotiation should be quite manageable.' America must not get sucked into negotiations for peace except for what amounted to an unconditional surrender of the guerrillas.\\" \\"While he (President Johnson) was destroying the country with bombing, defoliation and napalm, he could without cynicism speak of peace and progress. He believed that the destruction was unfortunately necessary before the construction could occur. That was Ho Chi Minh's fault.\\" \\"During the debate about whether the United States should send its bombers to help the French at Dien Bien Phu,  the Chief of Staff of the army, General Matthew B. Ridgway, recalled that in Korea, where he had been in command, `We had learned that air and naval power alone cannot win a war ... It was incredible to me that we had forgotten that bitter lesson so soon - that we were on the verge of making that same tragic error.' The lesson we had learned in World War II was forgotten before it was relearned in Korea, and was forgotten again in Vietnam. Old myths apparently neither die nor fade away. Before America withdrew from Vietnam, we dropped four times more bombs on Vietnam than all the bombs we dropped all over the world during World War II. It did not work, as the CIA regularly said it would not.\\" \\"LBJ had received the advice to start the air war to prevent the ground war.\\" But a failed air war provoked pressure for a ground war. \\"The decision to send in the marines was based on the assumption that they would serve only `security', not combat, objectives.

They show convincingly that intervention is just a cover for the selfish interests of the NATO powers, and that it will delay, not promote, a durable peace. They also oppose what they rightly call the inhuman economic sanctions that the UN imposed on the people of Serbia and Montenegro.<br /> Now 60,000 NATO troops, including 15,000 British, are going in, supposedly to enforce a cease&amp;#64979;fire in Bosnia. The authors demolish the arguments of those who call on outside powers to intervene for humanitarian or other reasons. We should recall that the 1918-1922 war of intervention against the Soviet Union started 'to police the armistice'. A Labour Government sent troops into northern Ireland in 1969 on a humanitarian pretext. Now we are at last seeing peace again there, ending that unjust interference and occupation, and we do not want another long-term foreign aggression to start.<br />The authors judge that &quot;While publicly claiming humanitarian concern, each of the imperialist powers is in reality seeking to advance its own economic, political, and strategic military interests, which conflict in an increasingly sharp way during a period of world capitalist depression.&quot; (p. 11) The Western capitalist powers aim to reduce Eastern Europe's countries again to semi-colonies. The US Government wants &quot;to block its imperialist rivals in Europe from getting a firmer economic foothold in the former Yugoslavia.&quot; (p. 62) The member states of the European Union, while pretending to have a common policy, pursue their own interests, in Yugoslavia as elsewhere.<br />  The NATO forces will not be holding the ring but rigging the fight. Everyone knows that the USA armed and trained the Croat and Bosnian Muslim armed forces. Remember that the USA, while supposedly bringing democracy to Haiti, was funding death squads that killed hundreds of supporters of the elected government (Guardian, 4 December 1995). If the USA wants peace in Bosnia, why lift the arms ban? As the authors sum up, intervention will probably bring &quot;more deaths, destruction, denial of national sovereignty, and brutal economic exploitation.&quot; (p. 18). It also risks spreading the war to other countries in Eastern Europe.<br />The war in Yugoslavia arose originally from conditions of worsening capitalist decline. The government there cut back on planned cooperation and relied increasingly on market forces. These created competition between regions and enterprises, and deepened regional inequalities, increasing pressures towards devolution and breakup. The government imported goods that Yugoslavs could have produced themselves, running up huge debts and increasing unemployment. Outside forces seized on these internal failings.<br />The people of Yugoslavia can solve their own problems, by taking the responsibility for rebuilding their country.

The towns were Aberdeen and Kirkcaldy in Scotland, Northampton and Coventry in the Midlands, Rochdale in the North-west and Swindon in the South-west.<br />  THE EFFECTS OF UNEMPLOYMENT<br /> The book shows how unemployment damages people's health and welfare. The authors see unemployment as the extreme case of the almost universal phenomenon of job insecurity. &quot;Those in insecure labour market positions suffered from a series of major disadvantages in terms of personal welfare. The unemployed, the insecure low-paid, and the insecure non-employed stood out from other groups in the degree of financial difficulty they confronted and in the extent to which they had been forced to cut living standards in recent years. Labour market insecurity was also linked to the type and quality of people's housing ... Those in more disadvantaged labour market positions had poorer psychological and physical health and were obliged to make more frequent use of local health services.&quot; &quot;There is a direct causal link between job insecurity and poor psychological health.&quot; Unemployed people who moved into secure jobs got better; those who moved into insecure jobs got only a little better. Job loss also had a destructive effect on marriages and on social life. But, contrary to myth, the experience of unemployment led to a stronger attachment to collectivist principles.<br /> The industrial genocide of the 1970s and 1980s hit young people most heavily, particularly those who would previously have gone into manufacturing jobs. Class origin determines occupation, due to the lack of education and of apprenticeships; and the nature of the occupation determines the chances of unemployment. Both links are getting stronger, because there is far less social mobility and far more inequality. So although all jobs are more insecure, manufacturing jobs are even more so.<br />  THE CAUSES OF UNEMPLOYMENT<br /> In the debate about the causes of the vast growth in unemployment, employers and their governments blame the 'supply-side', ie the working class. They say that wages and  benefits are too high, that trade unions distort supply, that the unemployed are work-shy, that there is a 'culture of poverty' which distinguishes an 'under-class'.<br /> The work attitudes of the unemployed were not different from those of the employed, and did not affect their vulnerability to unemployment. Nor were their work histories different: &quot;The unemployed had not experienced significantly more jobs or shorter average tenure in their longest jobs.&quot; &quot;Those that were currently unemployed were clearly not, on the evidence of their past work histories, inherently unstable members of the work-force.&quot; &quot;There was no evidence that differences in either employment motivation or in the flexibility of attitudes to job search affected the time that it took people to find work again.&quot; Most significantly, work attitudes did not predict who did and who did not get jobs.<br /> Welfare does not reduce employability, skill or will to work. Claimants and non-claimants seeking work had the same work attitudes. The level of benefits had no effect on the duration of unemployment. There is though a 'benefits effect' for women married to men who had been out of work for a year. Benefit rules take away any income earned by the wives of unemployed men on means-tested benefit, on a pound for pound basis, beyond a low threshold (£4 pre-1988). So lower-paid wives can face effective marginal 'taxation' rates of over 90% when they work.<br /> In all, the book is an excellent piece of research, which refutes all the lies about unemployment. It shows that full employment is necessary for any society that wants to be able to call itself civilised.obs are more insecure, manufacturing jobs are even more so.  <br />   THE CAUSES OF UNEMPLOYMENT<br /> In the debate about the causes of the vast growth in unemployment, employers and their governments blame the 'supply-side', ie the working class.

From the start, the authors admit to what they call an `overt as well as ideological pro-European underpinning'. (This incidentally reveals that they make the familiar EU supporters' confusion between Europe and the European Union.)<br />Their description of the articles that they analyse is often highly tendentious. They construe praise for any European country's achievements as `pro-Europe', again meaning pro-EU. They describe as `vague yet highly emotional' and `Europhobic' the legally correct statement that \\"No government has the right to give away sovereignty. Our sovereignty does not belong to politicians. It belongs to the people.\\" They write that calling Greece poverty-stricken is `inadmissibly xenophobic'. So we can easily see how they are able to dismiss all the coverage of the EU by the Times, the Telegraph, the Mail, the Express and the Sun as xenophobic.<br />They also accuse these papers of `Germanophobia'. Their evidence for this? That these papers dare to assert that Germany retains its historic ambitions to expand. The authors have apparently discovered a novelty: a capitalist class that has no desire to expand.<br />So this book shows how empty EU supporters' accusations of xenophobia are. We should not accept our enemy's definitions. Opposition to the EU is extremely widespread - we have to work with all those who oppose it. In the Second World War, the Soviet Union did not hold Churchill's past against him. Similarly, we must welcome patriotic allies in our fight for national independence, and we should concentrate our fire on those who back the EU against our nation. The struggle to retain our sovereignty is a national one.	2001-08-04

Unable to produce genuine science in their own fields, Lacan et al import concepts from the physical sciences - typically, chaos theory, fuzzy logic and the uncertainty principle - to try to impress. They regard science, evidence, reason and knowledge as oppressive. Kristeva characteristically responded to criticism by calling Sokal and Bricmont Francophobes!<br />The two physicists attack relativism, the idea that a statement's truth or falsity is relative to an individual or social group. (Some US colleges run courses like `queer studies', whose very subject is defined in relation to the interests of a social group, not by its field of study.) Relativists imply that modern science is just a `myth', a `narration' or a `social construction'. This allows in the notion that, for instance, creationism is just as valid as the theory of evolution.<br />The editors of `Social Text' accepted Sokal's famous spoof article, `Transgressing the boundaries: towards a transformative hermeneutics of quantum gravity', in which he wrote: \\"Physical `reality', no less than social `reality', is at bottom a social and linguistic construct.\\" The editors of `Science and Culture' accepted the Madsens' supposedly serious article, `Structuring postmodern science', in which they wrote \\"A simple criterion for science to qualify as postmodern is that it be free from any dependence on the concept of objective truth.\\" Says it all really!<br />This book tears apart these postmodernist theorists. Sokal and Bricmont uphold the scientific approach, that knowledge is based on respect for the clarity and logical coherence of theories and on the confrontation of theories with empirical evidence. Knowledge in both natural and social science is cumulative; our understanding of the world grows as we constantly check our ideas against the reality.atural and social science is cumulative; our understanding of the world grows as we constantly check our ideas against the reality.	2001-08-04

S. Naipaul. Part social history, part biography, part autobiography, it is above all a beautifully written and fascinating study of a writer's craft and life.<br />Both men are prolific and accomplished writers. Naipaul has written novels set in all five continents. His novels include `Guerrillas',  `In a Free State' and `A House for Mr Biswas'. He has also written a history of Trinidad, `The Loss of El Dorado'. Theroux is the author of `The Mosquito Coast', `The Great Railway Bazaar' and many other stories, novels and travel books.<br />Both men are remarkably self-contained; both are wandering scholars. Naipaul is famously rude and difficult. As a visiting professor in New York, he refused to give any classes. He once boasted, \\"I hate all music.\\" He appears to disparage all contemporary novelists, and most past ones: he said that he hated Jane Austen, Thomas Hardy and Henry James. (He did at least admit to admiring Thomas Mann's `Death in Venice' and Rudyard Kipling's `Plain Tales from the Hills', and he does have a justified contempt for George Orwell.)<br />Theroux writes, \\"the best writers are the most fanatical.\\" (Perhaps excellence at any work demands a certain fanaticism?) Certainly, Naipaul's uncompromising attention to his craft, his hatred of cant, of poses and affectation, of style, reveal the monomania necessary, but not sufficient, to creativity. The results in his work are uneven, but Theroux believes that Naipaul has produced one undoubted masterpiece, `A House for Mr Biswas': readers should judge for themselves.<br />Theroux too is obviously not an easy man: his wanderlust, his unpleasant sexual boasting and his tactless responses to Naipaul's second marriage show how difficult he finds it to form relationships. Consequently this rare long friendship must have meant much to both men: it finished only recently, spurring Theroux to write this account. The book ends in a haunting last encounter, full of confusion, pain and rejection.s in a haunting last encounter, full of confusion, pain and rejection.	2001-08-04

But this created only a strategic stalemate that lasted well into 1945. D-Day, the US-British landing in France, was the greatest amphibious operation in history. US-British superiority in numbers and firepower swiftly proved overwhelming, trapping Germany between two fronts and so ensuring her defeat. These battles brought US dominance of Western Europe.<br /> However, more than sixty per cent of the German Army was on the Eastern Front. Having staved off the Nazi onslaught, the Soviet Union now launched Operation Bagration, the first operation of the strategic counter-offensive designed to carry the war into Germany. It destroyed Army Group Centre, 25 German divisions, inflicting 300,000 casualties. Willmott writes that the Soviet high command `displayed a formidable level of flexibility, imagination and mastery of logistic and operational procedure at the strategic level'. He observes that the Soviet Union had to liberate Eastern Europe `as an unavoidable part of the process of the defeat of Germany'. The Soviet Union would dominate Central and Eastern Europe.<br /> In Asia, the Japanese attacked from Burma into India; the British defeated them at Imphal and Kohima. Japan defeated Chiang Kai-Shek's forces in South China, the Axis' only success in this climactic month. Chiang completely failed, even with huge US aid, to develop armies able to defeat Japan. But this last Japanese success was irrelevant to the wider war; to continue the war, Japan had to control not China but her own seas. US attacks in the Pacific forced Japan to battle in the Philippine Sea, where the US navy won an overwhelming victory. Japan too could not now avoid defeat. The USA would dominate the Pacific, though not Asia's landmass.minate the Pacific, though not Asia's landmass.	2001-08-04

In this new book, he maintains his hostility to China, writing  that \\"China seems to get worse the more we learn about it.\\" He insults his American and Chinese critics, claiming that they do not debate properly, yet his book is full of unfounded accusations, introduced by `the story is told that .. ' and `allegedly', and ending in abuse.<br />Nathan argues that the USA should use the ideas of constitutionalism, democracy and human rights to destroy China's state. As the war against Yugoslavia showed, moral intervention is only an opportunity away from military intervention.<br />Yet back-handedly, Nathan mentions achievements that make his hostility look jejune. He notes the Chinese people's legitimate nationalism, their policy of peace and non-intervention and their efforts to defend their sovereignty and national unity, recovered after a century of neocolonialism and exploitation.  Economically, China was a century behind the West. Nathan concedes that China has achieved industrial self-sufficiency; its economy grows by 11% a year; it feeds a population of a billion and can still export food; it has created an educated and cultured people and provides medical care good enough to establish a life expectancy of 69 years. It uses capital produced in China to boost its productivity; it retains collective ownership of the land and rejects IMF overlordship; it has achieved massive urbanisation, relatively equitable distribution of wealth, and excellent means of communication.<br />The Chinese Government has united and directed this vast and most disparate nation. It has ended the violent policy swings and `shock treatments', successfully integrated Hong Kong and publicly and effectively campaigned against corruption. There is little demand for pluralism, because the Party encompasses, debates and resolves a wide range of views: Nathan's own survey showed that less than 18% of the population favoured the kind of political reform that the USA demands.urvey showed that less than 18% of the population favoured the kind of political reform that the USA demands.	2001-08-04

He seeks to explain why the peoples made these great revolutionary advances, and also why the nobility fought to destroy them and to restore the savage old orders.  He studies the role of religion in the counter-revolutions, particularly the Papacy's bitter hostility to the Revolutions, compared to its notorious slap on the wrist for the Nazi counter-revolution. He cites Michelet's famous remark that the numbers killed by the Spanish Inquisition in just one province of Spain far exceeded the number killed by those defending France and its Revolution. The Inquisition was the crowning revelation of Christianity's ingrained violence, its hostility to people who dared to think for themselves, and to think differently from the Church: for six centuries, the leaders of the Catholic Church ordered the killing of millions of men and women for the glory of God.  After the French Revolution, the British ruling class organised the foreign counter-revolutionary war. This enormously increased the economic, social and military difficulties faced by the new Government. Later in the war, Napoleon continued France's defence against the counter-revolution, upheld the Revolution's destruction of the nobility's privileges, and extended its gains abroad.  After the end of World War One, the rulers of the British, US and French states united in `helping the Whites overthrow the Bolshevik regime', as Mayer writes. Their intervention prolonged the civil war, enormously increasing the suffering of the Soviet people, and adding to the huge economic, social and military difficulties faced by the new Government. Stalin played a key part in defending the Soviet Union against the Intervention; later, he expanded the Revolution's gains and, after defeating Hitler's counter-revolutionary intervention, extended these gains to the nations of Eastern Europe.  However, studies that focus on the violence and terror involved in counter-revolutions, even those studies, like Mayer's, that explain why people defended their countries' Revolutions, tend to overlook those Revolutions' tremendous achievements. Of course, people fought to survive the furies of the counter-revolution, but they also fought to build better societies, and they succeeded.error involved in counter-revolutions, even those studies, like Mayer's, that explain why people defended their countries' Revolutions, tend to overlook those Revolutions' tremendous achievements.

(We should note that Greer opposed Wallaces writing this book.) She contends that Greers life and work are so entwined that they demand a biography and review combined, and this she tries to provide.<br />For Greer, education was always the way forward. She had a drive to succeed through scholarship and writing. These achievements moved her on throughout her life, first from her Catholic upbringing, then from Sydneys self-indulgent Bohemia.<br />One of the two key influences on her intellectual development was the great literary critic Frank Leavis, passionately engaged with great literature, morally serious and contemptuous of commercial values. The other influence was the gloomy, Bohemian anarchism of the Australian philosopher John Anderson.<br />So academe and Bohemia have warred within Greer. Academe led to her life as a scholar and a literary and cultural critic. But the downside of Leavisism was its cultural warring, that ends up attacking ordinary people and suburban values, in unbalanced displays of self-hatred.<br />Bohemia led to the self-obsessed Byronism of her celebrity role, in which she claimed that sexual freedom was the key to, and criterion of, all other freedoms and helped to promote the modern commercial, sex-saturated culture, with its commodification of fetishes. Reaction easily co-opted this radical individualism and sexual freedom.<br />Greer united the best and worst of both traditions and their contradictions, generating both her dazzling dialectics and her wild excesses. Wallace concludes that Greer has never been tamed. But although she has rejected professional, urban and family life, what does she have to show for it? She leads a solitary, rural life, punctuated by dramatic incidents and epigrammatic performances on late night TV chat shows. She has written a series of books, brilliant in patches but basically incoherent and unsatisfying. She seems more like a performing scandaleuse than a free spirit.atisfying.

His inspiring book suggests how we can transform our defence industry.<br />The National Economic Development Office rejected the idea that `the market' would advance the British defence industry, because the US defence industry, massively Government-supported, was so dominant. It warned in its 1983 Report, Civil Exploitation of Defence Technology, that Britain might \\"become a technological colony of large offshore companies who will determine what products are made where and when.\\" Thatcher ignored the warnings: free market economics took precedence over jobs and the national interest. So we now have massive annual deficits in the key area of electronics, among others.<br />Britain's military budget for 1998-99 was £22.24 billion. By contrast, a district general hospital costs around £90 million, a comprehensive school for a thousand children nine million pounds. Military spending does not produce automatic benefits: our high military spending has not brought high productivity growth in manufacturing industry.<br />Successive Governments have proposed saving jobs in the defence industry by increasing arms exports. People rightly question the wisdom of peddling implements of mass destruction to dictatorial regimes abroad. Instead, the industry's 400,000 workers should be making their own plans for their industry's future, shifting their skills to producing for the home market modern reliable technology in every aspect of modern life. Defence workers can then produce goods for the telecommunications industry, public transport and civil aviation. They can get into environmental engineering, producing for example pollution monitoring equipment and power sources designed to reduce pollution.<br />Workers can redirect into civil production the scarce resources of engineering skills, much of that £22.24 billion budget, and the Government's military R&amp;D spending.

In this well-researched book, David Smith investigates work and its prospects across the European Union. He notes that the EU is marked by high rates of unemployment and low rates of employment. If it had the same employment rate as the USA, there would be an extra 34 million people in work. In France in 1997, the employment rate for men between 15 and 24 was only 16.5%. For men between 55 and 64, the employment rate in Britain was 59%, yet it was more than 65% in the USA.<br />Smith argues that entering the euro would cause even more unemployment, because Economic and Monetary Union is designed to create more mergers with their inevitable job losses. Also, to manage the economic differences with other countries, the Government would have to make changes in the real economy by sacking people and cutting wages, because it could no longer manage these differences by altering the exchange rate.<br />So entering the euro would not achieve full employment. But some now argue that this can never be done under any circumstances, so we might as well join the euro anyway. However, we can achieve full employment, by investing in industry. And we can do it without the extra taxes or loans that Smith asserts would be needed.<br />We can raise the money in a variety of ways. We could redirect the £35 billion that British companies invest abroad every year. We could demand that Britain adopts a more realistic foreign policy and defence posture: cutting the Foreign Offices bloated costs, ending overseas military aid, and withdrawing troops from Ireland, Bosnia, Kosovo and Sierra Leone would save us billions by. We could use all this money to modernise plant and machinery, set up new industries and firms, and rebuild our transport and energy systems<br />Every country in the EU could carry out a similar kind of investment programme. And if this programme conflicts with the EUs rules, too bad! If we need to take democratic control over our own economies to achieve full employment, then that is what we will have to do.then that is what we will have to do.	2001-08-04

He shows that health promotion is not a modern innovation and that it has existed as a distinct enterprise for as long as biomedicine. He examines its relationships with clinical science and health education. Medicine has always applied reductionist thinking to problems of disease and illness, ascertaining details of how things work in order to combat illness. But health is more than the absence of illness, so to understand health we need a holistic approach.<br />At the heart of the book is a brilliant discussion of the ethics of health promotion. He describes the Hippocratic medical model as paternalistic: to do good and do no harm is a start but it is not enough. Respect for patients' autonomy should instead be primary; practitioners must listen to the patient. We should consider patients not as consumers of health care, rather as co-producers of healthy lives. We should seek people's collaboration not their compliance (doesn't compliance just mean obedience?) Mozart complied with his doctor's instructions to take an antimony/mercury mixture for his colic and it killed him! Complaints of noncompliance lead to bad faith and victim-blaming, with accusations of `difficult patients' ( shouldn't it be the difficult doctor? Ask the patient!)<br />It is not a good idea to run health promotion through primary care commissioning arrangements with cash-limited budgets. The result will be to impose the medical model, in which health promotion is directed towards the individual. It is like healthism - the kind of individualist approach derived from American models (in both senses of the word!) with which we are all too familiar. The individualist approach detracts from the need for longer-term social, economic and political change to address the wider socioeconomic and environmental determinants of health. The Government's 1992 White Paper `The Health of the Nation' was just about disease prevention, not health provision, and did not provide a viable strategy for improving the nation's health. It avoided a social agenda, chose arbitrarily five areas of concern, and its targets were variously unrealistic, unchallenging and irrelevant.<br />He shows how health promotion can assist in preventing HIV/AIDS, tobacco use and alcohol abuse. He reviews the evidence proving the indisputable links between unemployment and poor health, poverty and poor health, and bad housing and poor health, and concludes that health is a social and political issue. Britain is a world leader in the science of nutrition, yet we are hardly the best fed nation in the world. Nutritional deficiencies increase the likelihood of developing diseases such as diabetes, coronary artery diseases and certain cancers.<br />  Health promotion is essentially collective. It combines educational, organisational, economic and environmental support for actions conducive to health. It is about empowering people to take responsibility for their health, not telling them how to behave. It must be sustained by neighbourhood advocacy, with people participating at all levels. For example, dietary health can be promoted successfully through mutual aid groups, eg the `Look After Your Heart' cooperative schemes in Bolton. Health promotion can then be a force for progress towards health for all, a key part of the new public health, whose goal is to effect national and local political change, to create those social and economic conditions that promote rather than damage health.<br />When we plan what we need for the NHS, in terms of rebuilding cooperation and promoting long-term planning, health promotion should have a vital role to play. This book should assist us to think clearly about what we need to do to improve public health.h.

It studies how America's people, especially its leaders, perceived America's role in the world in the years since 1945, during its brief dominance and subsequent decline. It also provokes some serious thinking about why nations rise and fall, and about how peoples can rebuild their countries.<br />The US ruling class's preference for empire over industry undermined the economy. Excessive military spending ran up the world's largest debts. The trade deficit ballooned, the dollar had to be devalued. The Vietnamese people's defeat of the US state in 1975 ended its predominance and forced its retrenchment. Its regional alliances fell - SEATO in 1977, CENTO in 1979, ANZUS in the 1980s.<br />\\"The bombs in Vietnam explode at home; they destroy the hopes and possibilities for a decent America\\", as Martin Luther King said. Maintaining the US state's world role reduced the general standard of living. It also increased the USA's dependence on imports, both of capital and of manufactured goods. Lack of investment led to waste of resources, wanton consumption, and poor-quality, low-efficiency production. The loss of hope for general social improvement led to the divisions of ethnicity, rather than to the ethics of unity.<br />America needs to rebuild its economy and society. The American people need to channel funds away from the dominant military machine, away from the state's unlimited foreign commitments and interventions. They need to invest the money in industry, transport, housing, health and education. They need to apply technology to production, to invest in producing high quality goods at low cost, to trade hard abroad and to keep their defence forces small and lean. They need a common culture based on `the imagination and discipline of production', in White's striking phrase.	2001-08-04

This book addresses the vital issue of what to do about Ireland. Unfortunately, it muddles matters rather than clarifying them. The key points, surely, are that 12,000 British soldiers are still over there, in what almost all British people consider to be a foreign country, and that these soldiers should not be there.<br />Liberation from the occupier has to be the main aim of a country still partly occupied by the forces of a foreign power. However, the book's editors, Anderson and Goodman, explicitly reject this, writing, \\"national sovereignty is the problem not the solution.\\" In effect, they back successive British Governments' claim that Ireland's difficulties are peculiar to Ireland, rather than the result of the British state's continued interference in Ireland.<br />The book's contributors generally advocate cultural not political change, avoiding the necessary, difficult, political work of moving the peace process forward. They seem to see nationalism in general as the enemy. One contributor wrongly asserts that  \\"British nationalism has state-sponsored, imperialist and sectarian origins.\\" This implies that the British people's feelings of patriotism and national identity are not really our own, and that we are just stupid dupes, to be filled with whatever ideas our rulers pour into us.<br />We should support the Good Friday Agreement as a step towards peace and towards the withdrawal of the troops. The IRA cease-fire is, thankfully, still in effect, as are the other ceasefires. No longer are terrorist groups murdering innocent civilians in Ireland and Britain.<br />But we have to do more than just support the Good Friday Agreement, because it is not the end result of the peace process. We have to make the Government set a date for complete British withdrawal from the whole island of Ireland.

Simons summarises: \\"United States policy, a slow and knowing extermination of a national people, falls unambiguously within the terms of the UN Genocide Convention.\\"<br />Eight years of sanctions have killed two million Iraqis, including a million children. Bush began them, supported by Major. Now Clinton maintains them, supported by Blair, `the perfect peacekeeper', in Kofi Annan's words. Protocol I, Article 54 of the Geneva Convention states, \\"Starvation of civilians as a method of warfare is prohibited.\\" The United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly denounced the US blockade of Cuba as illegal and demanded that it be lifted. (British Governments usually abstain on these votes.) Ramsey Clark, a former US Attorney-General, says, \\"I see the blockade as a crime against humanity, in the Nuremburg sense, as a weapon of mass destruction. The blockade is a weapon for the destruction of the masses, and it attacks those segments of society that are the most vulnerable ... infants and children, the chronically ill, the elderly and emergency medical cases.\\"<br />Some say we must ensure that economic sanctions respect agreed exemptions. The exemptions are for public relations: sanctions are designed to kill. A doctor might as well call for the humane implementation of torture.  US and British Governments have consistently vetoed the delivery of baby food and medical supplies to Iraq. The US Government has consistently blocked contracts for medical supplies arranged by British companies.<br />The sanctions are a continuation of the war by other means. The war itself was more a traditional colonial massacre, with one side having a huge advantage in forces and weaponry. The US and British forces fired tens of thousands of depleted uranium (DU) shells. They are an illegal weapon, under UN Resolution 32/84 of December 1977, which bans the use of `radioactive material weapons'. The US Army admitted that some US soldiers were unknowingly exposed to DU radiation during the War. Obviously, we need not look any further for the cause of `Gulf War syndrome'. The US forces also used chemical weapons against the Iraqis. At the war's end, the US forces bombed troops no longer able to offer resistance, and those in retreat: both of these are war crimes.<br />To blame Castro and Saddam Hussein for their peoples' suffering is like blaming Churchill for the British people's suffering under the Nazi blockade, or like blaming the rabbis for the Jews' suffering under the Nazis.<br />It is a hideous mockery even to talk of an ethical foreign policy when genocide is being perpetrated.

Literary critics all too often privilege themselves and their subject into what they would probably call a hegemonic role. But really, literary criticism is part of the job of teachers of language and literature. Ideas about literary works may be fascinating, but they are not usually the ideas that change society. No literary critic ever originated an idea as good as `Rebuild Britain'.<br />Lambropoulos asserts that progress in politics depends on mass initiative and involvement. He puts a most welcome and constructive emphasis on the \\"collective constitution of a democratic polity\\" and on \\"affirmative politics of citizenship and engagement\\".<br />He avers the need to break with post-structuralism and cultural studies. Cultural studies, with its exclusive emphasis on identity and its representations, leads to identity politics. What Lambropoulos calls the \\"self-defeating narcissism of resistance\\" leads to sectarianism: every oppressed individual creates his or her own private sect. This issues in an oppositional pseudo-politics composed of denunciation and accusations of betrayal.<br />Both cultural studies and identity politics come to dead ends, the one in theory, the other in practice.<br />Cultural studies ends in monotonous narratives of victimisation. Its negative preoccupation with otherness and difference issues in multiculturalism, often expressed as a lowest common denominator of culture, rather than as an enriching exchange of mind between cultures. Cultural studies tend to focus on deconstructions and critiques, a perpetual taking of differences, of finding grounds for disagreement and separateness.<br />Typical of cultural studies is the subgrouping of postcolonial studies. This academic subject concerns itself with the alienated intellectual's multiple, shifting identities and border-crossings, his rites of passage and exile. The subject avoids questions of national sovereignty, of nation-building. It abhors any collective sense of the common national tasks of rebuilding a country in a shared space, with a common history and forms of rule.<br />Identity politics ends in segregated ghettoes, whose glib representatives compete for attention in the global marketplace, crying their uniquely niched wares and woes. They seek superiority in victimhood, not solidarity in achievement. This kind of politics commercialises pluralism and commodifies difference. In striving for group rights, for minority rights, it devotes its energies to pursuing compensation for presumed discrimination, at the expense of the public good, civic virtue, and political justice. A focus on separate minority interests means neglecting and overriding the collective good. The general good is greater than a mere cumulation of particular gains.e and exile.

Particularly important, he shows how vital manufacturing industry is to a flourishing economy.<br />He shows that productivity increases are much easier to achieve in manufacturing than in services: for example, output per head in US manufacturing has recently been growing by 4% a year, while in services it has fallen by 14%. But since manufacturing now accounts for only 17% of US GDP, it does not have enough weight to pull the whole economy forward. Consequently, most American workers' living standards have stagnated or declined over the last 30 years. The rundown of industry has caused a consistent fall in real US earnings per hour.<br />The domination of finance capital has imposed literally counterproductive policies both in the USA and in Britain. It has kept the currency overvalued, so exports wither, manufacturing, investment and living standards all fall.<br />The EU embraces the same policies. The European Central Bank puts price stability above all else. Mills shows that this is the wrong goal, because lower inflation does not cause greater growth. For instance, between 1953 and 1969, Britain's cumulative inflation rate was 3.4%; Japan's was 4%. Yet Japan's annual growth rate was 10% while Britain's was only 2.8%. Japan grew faster because the prices of its exports rose by only 33%; Britain's export prices rose by 380%! This was because the pound was grossly overvalued; the yen was not.<br />What should we do? We have to make the Government do the job it was elected to do. So when Gordon Brown talks about full employment, or Tony Blair calls for a technological revolution, we must say yes, and insist that they put our money where their mouth is, and invest in manufacturing industry.	2001-08-04

Adolf Eichmann played a key role in transporting millions of Jews to the extermination camps. After he vanished at the end of the war, Zvi Aharoni, an experienced Mossad operative, led the search for him.<br />Eichmann, along with at least 300 other leading Nazis escaped from Austria  to Italy and then to Argentina via the convent route, assisted by the Roman Catholic Church and the Red Cross. However, after Aharoni located and identified Eichmann,  the Israeli Government made no attempt to get him extradited from Argentina. It ordered Aharoni to kidnap Eichmann and smuggle him to Israel. The kidnapping, in May 1960, broke Argentinas laws, as Israels Prime Minister David Ben Gurion later admitted. The United Nations General Assembly passed a Resolution condemning the abduction as a violation of Argentinas sovereignty.<br />The Israeli Government put Eichmann on trial in 1961. He famously claimed that he was only obeying orders, but was found guilty of instigating the killing of millions of Jews. He was executed on 1 June 1962.<br />The whole enterprise showed the Israeli Governments cavalier attitude to other countries sovereignty. Its technical success was used to warrant later repeated attacks on other nations sovereignty. These aggressions damaged the countries attacked: they also degraded Israel itself. Aharoni laments that after he retired the rules changed and the ideals of his past no longer applied; with the occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, Israel had become a different country. (A key indicator of this change was that, appallingly, confessions obtained by force became admissible evidence in court.) But he cannot see that his careers most triumphant moment - the forcible abduction of Eichmann - contributed to this moral degradation.	2001-07-31

In his fifty-year career, Salisbury won over Disraeli, destroyed Lord Randolph Churchill, charmed Queen Victoria, wrecked Gladstone's hopes for Irish Home Rule, and saw off Bismarck. The book is based on Salisbury's archive at Hatfield House, and on the papers of more than 140 of his contemporaries.<br />Roberts records Salisbury's many contradictions. He supported \\"the right of a minority of Americans to secede from a Union, but not a majority of Irishmen.\\" He opposed socialism as mere confiscation, but upheld the actions of his ancestor, the First Earl, who had confiscated much of Ulster's land between 1607 and 1609, then selling it to City and Scottish businessmen.<br />He wrote eloquently against intervention in other countries' domestic affairs. \\"The Assemblies that meet at Westminster have no jurisdiction over the affairs of other nations. Neither they nor the Executive, except in plain defiance of international law, can interfere with the brigandage of Italy, or the persecutions in Spain, or the teachings of the schools in Schleswig-Holstein. What is said in either House about them is simply impertinence ... It is not a dignified position for a Great Power to occupy, to be pointed out as the busybody of Christendom.\\" And, \\"there is no practice which the experience of nations more uniformly condemns, and none which governments more consistently pursue.\\"<br />Indeed, his Governments annually waged colonial wars in Asia and Africa, adding 2.5 million square miles and 44 million people to the Empire. His war against the Boers was particularly shameful: he claimed that Britain had sovereignty over the Transvaal, although the British Government had ceded this in the 1884 Pretoria Convention. (Roberts grants that Salisbury was `on exceedingly tricky ground legally'.) As Salisbury admitted, \\"If our ancestors had cared for the rights of other peoples, the British Empire would never have been made.\\"the rights of other peoples, the British Empire would never have been made.\\"	2001-07-31

Dividing countries is a way of controlling them, before and after independence. The US and British states have divided Yugoslavia, then Bosnia, and now Kosovo. `Ethnic' divisions suit imperialism. Carlos Westendorp, the High Representative in Bosnia, has said that Kosovo's warring factions must be told, \\"Kosovo doesn't belong to either of you. It's ours. It's the new empire. It's the new colonialism done in the name of the international community.\\"<br />Kumar examines other examples of partition and addresses the difficulties of reversing it. For instance, Blair's bullying tactics have now stalled the Irish peace process. He set five deadlines for implementing the Good Friday Agreement; he blustered that `there was no Plan B'. According to the Agreement, the IRA did not have to decommission its weapons: then Blair said they would, then he said they wouldn't. As long as the British Government has not set a date for withdrawal, all the Irish parties remain dependent on Britain, relating primarily to the British presence, either loving or hating the `Brits'. Once the Government sets a date, then they will all have to focus on their common task of rebuilding their beautiful country.<br />In an ironic reversal, partition could now be visited upon Britain; the European Union is regionalising `Euroland', to break up sovereign nation states. It fosters identity politics, puffing up cultural and regional identifications at the expense of class and national realities.<br />Kumar points out that the way to reverse partition is to achieve peace through development. But the US-British-EU aim of strengthening `market democracy' cuts across this goal, because it generates divisions and inequalities. Every country needs to create a common commitment to a strategy of rebuilding; they each need a workers' nationalism to unite and liberate their country.	2001-07-31

For instance, Benjamin Kidd, in 'The Control of the Tropics', wrote that the inhabitants of the tropics had no right to their resources; he held that they must be developed for the general good of the world. In fact they were developed, when they were, only for the general good of the british ruling class, as grasping a bunch of villains as the world has ever seen.<br /> Havinden and Meredith conclude, &quot;Throughout this book we have shown that colonialism and development were largely contradictory and that this produced a gap between the dreams (or myths) of developing the 'great estate' and the economic realities. The structural imbalances in the economies of the British colonies which were apparent by the end of the colonial era were the direct result of the pursuit of the Chamberlain aim of buttressing the British economy with a 'great estate' in the tropics. In the end the Chamberlain dream was abandoned along with formal colonial rule but its persistence over the previous seventy years bequeathed the now ex-colonies a legacy which would continue to inhibit their economic development in the years to come.&quot;  They wrote, &quot;The Colonial Office's development philosophy still depended upon the belief that once the state had provided a framework ordered government and a basic infrastructure, private entrepreneurs and private capital could be relied upon to initiate and carry out a steady programme of economic advance.  ... the development problem was not as simple as this.&quot;  Pre-1914, &quot;the incomes of most of the inhabitants of the tropical colonies remained pitifully small and their standard of living abysmally low.&quot; As now, disgusting levels of wealth fed off vilely low poverty.<br /> Sir Henry Moore, Assistant Secretary at the Colonial Office, wrote in 1939 that, &quot;any proposals for the creation of secondary industry in the Colonial Empire are received with a marked lack of enthusiasm, if not with suspicion. The reason for this, I suggest, appears to me to be found in the more or less unwritten rule that any proposals, whether in the field of industry or tariffs, which give rise to any conflict of economic interest, should be approached from the standpoint that United Kingdom trade interests must rank first, Dominion trade interests second, and those of the Colonial Empire last.&quot; For 'trade interests', read fat cats.

Frymann : legacy of osteopathy to children	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Vitally important book on children's health	This inspiring book is a record of the lifes work of a great and humane woman. All parents, health professionals and educationists, indeed everybody concerned with childrens development and welfare, should read it.<br />Frymanns early research showed that birth trauma, resulting from prolonged difficult labour, is the commonest cause of development delays in children. 80% of children with learning difficulties, attention deficits and autism, suffered traumatic birth during which the cranium was compressed as it passed down the birth canal. This limited physiological motion and disturbed the development of the nerve pathways, impairing coordination and confusing sensory input. Yet textbooks of child psychiatry uniformly ignore difficult labours material effects on childrens development.<br />Autistic childrens sensory dysfunctions, and characteristic perceptual and attention deficits, have a neurological origin, not a psychological origin (as postulated by Bruno Bettelheim). The psychological symptoms are the effects, not the causes, of autism. Perinatal complications are more common among autistic children than among their normal siblings or normal controls. Over half of autistic children show focal neurological defects and EEG abnormalities. Many have damage to the temporal lobe causing memory problems. Neurological impairment produces other mental health problems.<br />Birth trauma can also cause diseases of the ear, nose and throat, among the commonest illnesses. Compression of the facial bones may contribute to sinusitis, compression of the temporal bones to glue ear and vertigo, and compression of the jugular foramen to vomiting. Maladjustments of the jaw can lead to lisping and to difficulties with chewing, eating and swallowing.<br />A newborn babys cranium can be damaged in all these many different ways, but by the same token, it can also be mended. Osteopathic treatment can improve the cranial structure and so improve neurological function, assisting in restoring proper function in all these areas. Frymanns 3-year study of 186 children at the Osteopathic Center for Children in La Jolla, California, resulted in the classic 1972 paper, Effect of osteopathic medical management on neurological development in children. This showed that osteopathic treatment improved sensory, intellectual and motor performance in children with neurological problems. Her motto is, Dont punish your children, treat them. The earlier the treatment, the better the results.<br />These findings show that osteopathy should be included in paediatric health care and in special needs education. Ophthalmology, audiology, psychiatry and obstetrics could also all benefit from embracing the science of osteopathy. Osteopathic treatment can also reduce or eliminate the effects of other trauma. Often the osteopathic approach holds the key to solving the patients problem: osteopathy has a vital part to play in preventive medicine.ction, assisting in restoring proper function in all these areas.

Since 1987 crimes of violence against the person, especially among young people, have risen by an unprecedented 40%. In this impressively researched and well-argued book, Oliver James carefully examines, and then rejects, the usual facile explanations of moral fecklessness, single parenting, violence in the media, low intelligence, an 'underclass culture', or rogue genes.<br /> James claims that the cause is the rapid growth since 1979 in the numbers of people living on low incomes. Between 1979 and 1981 the proportion of boys being raised in a low-income family rose from 19% to 30%, and it has stayed at 30% ever since. These boys grew up in families suffering severe, growing, visible and highly stressful relative deprivation. A growing number of them has subsequently committed crimes of violence.<br /> James cites relevant evidence from large cross-national surveys that show that the more unequal a society is, the more violent it is. &quot;Homicide rates are lower in countries with unemployment and training policies that keep unemployment low. The higher the proportion of Gross National Product that is devoted to social service programmes ensuring the well-being of the work force, the less violent the society. This applies even within nations. In comparisons of different States within America, levels of State aid to families with children vary considerably; the higher the levels of benefit, the lower the levels of violence in the State.&quot; (pp. 7-8)<br /> He cites the American criminologist Elliott Currie, &quot;It isn't accidental that among developed countries, the United States is afflicted simultaneously with the worst rates of violent crime, the widest spread of income inequality, and the most severe public policies towards the disadvantaged.&quot; (p. 64.) In conclusion, James holds the Government directly responsible for the increase in juvenile violence: &quot;government economic and social policies, therefore, have been the primary cause of the increased rate in the rise of recorded violence since 1987.&quot; (p. 111)social policies, therefore, have been the primary cause of the increased rate in the rise of recorded violence since 1987.&quot; (p. 111)	2001-07-31

Unfortunately, however, Halliday has produced a dull and schematic book, academic in the worst sense, just another pessimistic lament for the end of history and the end of revolutions.<br />He attempts to summarise the origins and effects of revolutions from Frances 1789 to Irans 1979, and to place them in their international contexts. But he slights both the makers and the achievements of every revolution, and neglects those most important facts, that revolution stopped World War One, won World War Two, and has prevented World War Three (so far).<br />He also tries to analyse the forms of counter-revolution. But he confusingly describes the counter-revolutions of 1989 as revolutions, even though he helpfully provides us with evidence of how catastrophic they have been for workers: their living standards plummeted, as in every East European country (except Poland) Gross Domestic Product fell by 50% between 1989 and 1997, and in the former Soviet Republics by 44%.<br />...<br />The books failings derive from Hallidays Trotskyism. In this book, he consistently uses Trotskys metaphysical theory of combined and uneven development. Halliday was on the New Left Reviews editorial board, and he still promotes their self-flattering beliefs that intellectuals are the vanguard of progress, and that the writings of the European oppositional theorists are the only true Marxism. They all believe that the ruling class dominates the mind of the British working class, which can only avoid incorporation into the state if it acknowledges the leadership of those who understand the works of these theorists. Yet somehow, the British working class has always managed to make its own decisions, keep its independence of mind and escape incorporation.	2001-07-31

Its site had long been known as Magnitnaia gora, 'magnetic mountain', because the iron ore disturbed the early settlers' compasses.  The Soviet Union decided that it should be the base for developing the country's eastern regions and for spreading industry more evenly through the Union. They knew that &quot;Metal is the basis of modern civilisation.&quot; Industrialisation, making the machines needed to make machines, was a matter of the Soviet Union's survival as an independent country, under constant threat of capitalist attack.<br /> They used coking coal from 2000 kilometres away, from the Kuznetsk basin in West Siberia, thus uniting the Urals and Siberia, iron-ore and coal production. They built a mining-energy-chemical metallurgical complex, responsible also for housing and schools, for a population of 200,000 in the world's first newly constructed socialist city. The Soviet welfare state was centred on its large factories. On 1 February 1932, blast furnace No. 1 produced the first pig iron, for the 17th Party Conference, to symbolise the fact that it was a steel plant created by and for the working class, in the class war against capitalism.<br /> The plant comprised the largest blast furnace in the world, the largest mechanised mining enterprise in the Soviet Union, a coke plant equal to any in Germany or the USA, one of the first large blooming mills in the Soviet Union, and a series of rolling mills. In 1934 it was renamed the Stalin Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Complex.<br /> How was it achieved? There was national unity, there was no private ownership of land or of the means of production, and no hiring of wage labour. A sense of social justice was built into property relations, and there was party leadership. According to Lenin, the party is &quot;the mind, honour and conscience of the epoch&quot;. It was also the inspiration.<br /> So, the Soviet Union was able to plan its leap forward to an advanced industrial civilisation, a city-based society engineered to create the utmost well-being, productivity and national power. The Soviet Union was twice as urbanised in 1939 as it had been in 1926.&quot;National power and social welfare drove the revolutionary process.&quot;<br /> The Soviet Union promised a better life for workers and their children, based on tangible improvements: jobs for all, universal pensions, universal benefits for disability, sickness, pregnancy and childbirth, affordable housing, free health care and child care, education for all, subsidised prices, and paid holidays for workers.<br /> These achievements can still inspire workers today.

It shows that the US Government, in collaboration with the British and Canadian Governments, spent $500,000,000 between 1951 and 1953 developing such weapons, based on those used by the Japanese Army in its attack on China.<br />In February 1952, the Joint Chiefs of Staff called for a strong offensive biological warfare capability without delay and for developing all effective means of waging war without regard for precedents as to their use. The biological weapons were incorporated into the Strategic Air Commands strategic plans for general war. The US state has never ratified the 1925 Geneva Protocol banning biological weapons.<br />The US state fought its war against Korea with no regard for legal constraints. It threatened to use nuclear weapons. It used chemical weapons - 70,000 gallons of napalm a day in 1951, and phosphorus bombs - despite having ratified the Protocol against chemical weapons. The USAF bombed civilians mercilessly: as General Curtis LeMay boasted, We burned down just about every city in North and South Korea both ... We killed over a million Koreans and drove several million more from their homes.<br />The authors examine the evidence of germ-bearing insects, feathers and other carriers found after USAF bombing raids and look at the consequent outbreaks of unusual illnesses. Many captured US pilots confessed to dropping bombs containing these materials. They later retracted their confessions, claiming that their captors had brainwashed them. A US Army study found no evidence of this. The pilots retracted under threat of death: the US Attorney General said that American POWs who collaborated with the enemy might face charges of treason.<br />The authors write, we are led to the conclusion that the United States took the final step and secretly experimented with biological weapons in the Korean War.

John Mills is a very rare person, an economist with business experience in trade and production. In this excellent book, he shows that Economic and Monetary Union would be bad for all our economies.<br />Experience shows that the more economically integrated the European Union has become, the worse it has performed. From its start in 1958, the original six members had no form of economic or monetary union, and they grew by 5.4% a year. Then in 1972 they created the currency snake; it lasted only until 1976. By 1974, economic growth had ceased. After the snake expired, growth resumed: 4.9% in 1976, 3% in 1977-80.<br />They created the Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1979 and it lasted until 1993. The ERM slowed growth and raised unemployment across the EU: growth was only 1.7% a year; unemployment averaged 7% and inflation 7.8%. Even so, we joined, because the whole establishment wanted us to, not because the people wanted to. Polls in 1989 showed that 93% of the Chief Executives of large British companies and City institutions believed that we should join the ERM. We joined in October 1990: during our two-year membership unemployment rose by 1.4 million and national output fell; manufacturing output fell by 7% and manufacturing jobs by 14%. It was worse for us even than for the rest of the EU.<br />In the same period, the rest of the world grew by 3.2%, proving that the EU's slow growth was not due to world conditions. The ERM was the main cause of the EU-wide recession: from 1990 to 1993, growth ceased altogether. After ERM expired, growth resumed: 2.9% in 1994, 2.4% in 1995. But implementing the Maastricht criteria for EMU slowed growth again and raised unemployment. EU unemployment is now 12%, 30 million, according to ILO figures.<br />What would entering Economic and Monetary Union mean for us? It would mean deflation, higher unemployment, slump. It would also mean the end of Britain's independence. Politics and economics are indivisible. The arguments for constitutional, economic and political independence are one. The experiment of making the Bank of England independent has clearly failed: we should call on the Government to reassert control of interest rates. This is  a political demand, a constitutional demand, and an economic demand.<br />Under EMU, eight unelected European Central Bankers would control our currency, and as Keynes said, \\"Whoever controls the currency, controls the Government.\\" To make EMU credible to the markets, they would keep interest rates high, imposing deflation. This would mean higher unemployment and taxes, lower wages and lower public spending.<br />  The Gold Standard was a way of trying to fix currency values together. It failed disastrously, ending in the Great Crash. Economic growth ceased. After the Gold Standard expired, growth resumed. In 1931, Britain left the Gold Standard, devaluing by 24%; money supply rose by 34%; interest rates were about zero, and there was some tariff protection. Labour's `Iron Chancellor' Philip Snowden said leaving the Gold Standard \\"would reduce the standard of living of the workman by 50%.\\" What actually happened? From 1932 to 1937, manufacturing output rose 58%; 2.7 million new jobs were created (1.3 million in manufacturing); growth averaged 3.8% a year, and living standards rose. Lower interest rates brought a boom in house-building.<br />By contrast, the French Government stayed in the Gold Standard and kept the franc overvalued: GDP fell by 17%, industrial production by a quarter, until the Popular Front Government devalued the franc.<br />This Government claims that the way to restore industry's competitiveness is to invest in skill. But this will not restore manufacturing while there is still not enough demand in the economy. The present regime of tight money and high interest rates, leading to a high exchange rate, doesn't work. It's like putting on the brakes when you're going up hill. An overpriced pound means dear exports and cheap imports: in the first quarter of 1998, our goods trade gap was £4.7 billion, the worst since 1990.<br />The remedy does not lie in reforming the labour market or the public sector. To stimulate output and employment, we need more demand, higher wages and more public spending. Supply-side reforms, better education, more information technology, may improve efficiency and productivity, but without an expansion of demand this can lead not to growth but to more unemployment and unused resources.<br />The Maastricht Treaty which set up EMU has only money and budget targets, there are no real world targets, for full employment or higher growth. It is innately deflationary: those not meeting the targets must deflate, yet those meeting them do not have to reflate. A Treaty cannot be reformed; it can only be accepted or rejected. Sir Nigel Wicks, Chair of the EU Monetary Committee says, \\"I would not regard monetary policy as an instrument for solving unemployment.\\" We who have experienced decades of monetarism in action regard that as an understatement. EMU is monetarism on a European scale; it is Thatcherism on a European scale.<br />We need lower interest rates to fund projects fitting in to our plans for rebuilding Britain. We need lower taxes on jobs. We need taxes on capital: tax Murdoch, not toady to him. We need to legislate so that pension funds, which are heavily subsidised by taxpayers, are required to invest in British industry and services. The Government could promote investments with a high social rate of return. We need to reimpose controls on speculators. But we can't do these jobs when in EMU: EMU forbids them all.<br />We need to keep out of EMU. Joining would clearly be bad for our health.

Sir Nigel Wicks, Chair of the EU Monetary Committee says, \\"I would not regard monetary policy as an instrument for solving unemployment.\\" We who have experienced decades of monetarism in action regard that as an understatement. EMU is monetarism on a European scale; it is Thatcherism on a European scale.<br />We need lower interest rates to fund projects fitting in to our plans for rebuilding Britain. We need lower taxes on jobs. We need taxes on capital: tax Murdoch, not toady to him. We need to legislate so that pension funds, which are heavily subsidised by taxpayers, are required to invest in British industry and services. The Government could promote investments with a high social rate of return. We need to reimpose controls on speculators. But we can't do these jobs when in EMU: EMU forbids them all.<br />We need to keep out of EMU. Joining would clearly be bad for our health. Then we will rebuild Britain as a self-reliant, industrial and sovereign nation.	2001-07-31

He makes sense of the vast number of accounts, and of the various themes rehearsed.<br />The Thatcher Government portrayed its decision to fight, and its conduct of the campaign, as expressions of the essential national character, the `true Britain'. The mass media at once swung into line. In fact, the war primarily served a purpose hostile to the nation, Thatcher's political survival.<br />Government and media equated Argentina's initial recovery of the Islands with the Nazi invasion of Poland, as they immediately identified the war with the Second World War, and Thatcher with Churchill. They saw the Falklands as the image of Britain, a ravished island Eden. They ignored the harsher similarities, of economic dependence, under-investment and social inequality.<br />The media depended on the military for information, which  turned the journalists into what one called `troopie groupies'. The media became a single, responsible voice speaking for `our common cause'. According to their account, 'our' Government never faltered, `our' flawless heroes carried out a perfect campaign. On the other side, their corrupt, undemocratic Government and its murderous thugs waged a campaign of Latin incompetence.<br />The war was supposedly unavoidable. There was no alternative; the British Government, guileless innocent in a naughty world, was forced into war by the Satanic enemy. Our supreme temptation was the serpent `appeasement', diplomacy a cunning trap set by wily foreigners. Peace demonstrators were described as pro-fascist, dissenters as collaborators. In practice, this meant rejecting in principle all ceasefire proposals and negotiations; it meant war without compromise. The only acceptable ethical outcome was the enemy's total surrender.<br />Government and media celebrated the war as the source of national salvation, even, in Thatcher's memoirs, of world salvation. War was rebirth, welfare, humanitarianism.<br />This presentation of the Falklands war has become the media model for all subsequent wars. Kevin Foster's book is a model of sanity; its publication now is especially timely.was rebirth, welfare, humanitarianism.<br />This presentation of the Falklands war has become the media model for all subsequent wars.

His memoir portrays the vanished world of wartime colonial Africa, and also records the terrifying nature of the war against the Japanese Army.<br />In spring 1944, British armies defeated the Japanese Army at the battles of Imphal and Kohima, saving India from invasion. Nunneley played his part in this forgotten war, fighting against Japan's elite `White Tigers' during their retreat through the rain-sodden, disease-ridden jungles of Burma. He was mentioned in despatches for his leadership of successful jungle reconnaissance and fighting patrols, and he was wounded in hand-to-hand combat.<br />  He writes movingly about the ethical dilemmas that war inevitably presents, and about the nature of leadership. He recounts the story of Lieutenant Harward, who was accused of abandoning his men when under attack during the 1879 war against the Zulus. The court martial acquitted him, but his commander-in-chief, Sir Garnet Wolseley, refused to confirm the verdict.<br />Wolseley wrote indignantly, \\"Had I released this officer without making any remarks upon the verdict in question, it would have been a tacit acknowledgement that I concurred in what appears to me a monstrous theory, viz., that a regimental officer who is the only officer present with a party of soldiers actually and seriously engaged with the enemy, can, under any pretext whatever, be justified in leaving them to their fate. The more helpless a position in which an officer finds his men, the more it is his bounden duty to stay and share their fortune, whether for good or ill.\\"<br /> Unfortunately, after the war Nunneley did not perhaps put his leadership skills to the best use. He became a deputy director of Beaverbrook Newspapers (1956-62) and then a director of the British Railways Board (1962-87). He was a member of Lord Beeching's three-man team that produced the infamous Report in 1963.three-man team that produced the infamous Report in 1963.	2001-07-31

In terms familiar to those who oppose EMU and global capital, Hall denounces Japan's `reactionary nationalism and emotional antiforeignism'. The book supports US capital's attempt to impose on Japan what Hall calls its `rigid laissez-faire trade ideology', pressing Japan to dismantle its import and export controls.<br />For instance, Hall deplores as `nationalistic utilitarianism' a Ministry of Education official's statement that, \\"The Japanese education system has long been designed for the purpose of training manpower for the Japanese society alone.\\" This seems much better than Britain's policy for higher education, of selling education services to foreign would-be elites so that later they might remember us and be nice to us.<br />Japan is right to defend its sovereignty against `free market' intrusions, right to oppose globalisation and liberalisation. It has the right to make its own decisions about how to shape its institutions, without foreign interference. The US Government is worried that other Asian nations (particularly Malaysia just now) are adopting Japan's successful strategy. Japan's Government intervenes and protects key industries, it maintains controls on labour and capital, and it has strong barriers against US hegemony in law, journalism, academia and science. It strongly supports technical and vocational education and Research and Development, especially in the new information technology industries.<br />The US Government is worried not so much by Japan's present problems as by its earlier success in becoming the world's second economic power. Consequently, Clinton has committed the US Government to maintaining present troop levels in East Asia until at least 2015. Japan is building up its military to make a greater `international contribution' to peacekeeping operations and regional security, aspiring to a seat on the UN Security Council.

It tells us much about international affairs, especially the Soviet Union's successful efforts to delay Hitler's treacherous attack in 1941, and on the period since Stalin's death in 1953. As he told Chuev, &quot;I write about socialism - what it is and, as peasants say, 'what we need it for.'&quot;<br />The book shows Stalin's great achievements: solving the nationalities question, industrialisation, the collectivisation of agriculture, the defeat of Hitler. Molotov points out that the Soviet Union created &quot;industrialisation by our own means, by our own manpower. We could not rely on foreign loans.&quot; He sums up the successes of the 1920s and 1930s: &quot;In essence we were largely ready for the war. The five-year plans, the industrial capacity we had created - that's what helped us to endure, otherwise we wouldn't have won out.&quot; As he said, &quot;Many things have been done wonderfully, but that is not enough.&quot;<br />  Molotov was &quot;a fighter for communism, Lenin's longest surviving comrade-in-arms.&quot; He was born in 1890. In 1912 he helped to found Pravda. In 1917 he joined the executive committee of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies. In October 1917 he became a member of the Military Revolutionary Committee which prepared the armed uprising in Petrograd.<br />In 1926 he became a member of the Politburo, where he worked till 1952. From 1930, when he became Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, he helped to lead the drives for industrialisation and for collectivisation. He took a leading role in the fight to defeat the Fifth column. In May 1939 he was appointed Commissar for Foreign Affairs.<br />He was Deputy Chairman of the State Council of Defence throughout the Great Patriotic War (World War Two). In 1942 he signed the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Alliance; he also secured Roosevelt and Churchill's agreement &quot;To the urgent tasks of creating a second front in Europe in 1942.&quot; In 1943 he seconded Stalin at the Teheran Conference, and in 1945 he did the same at the Yalta and Potsdam Conferences. He represented the Soviet Union at the San Francisco Conference which founded the United Nations.<br />In 1957 the attempt to remove Krushchev was defeated and Molotov and the other Communists were expelled from the Central Committee. In 1962 he was expelled from the Party. In 1984 he was reinstated. He died in 1986.<br />Perhaps his epitaph should be what he said in 1976, &quot;Properly speaking, what was Hitler's aggression? Wasn't it class struggle? It was. And the fact that atomic war may break out, isn't that class struggle? There is no alternative to class struggle. This is a very serious question. The be-all and end-all is not peaceful coexistence.

(The peoples of China, Spain, Britain, Germany, Japan and Korea had obviously not shared this belief, and had not surrendered under bombing.)<br />But the USAF, and Presidents Johnson and Nixon, knew better: they would bomb Vietnam to submit. (Incidentally, British firms made many of the bombs. The British Ambassador in the USA said, \\"The United Kingdom was naturally only too happy to sell the bombs but preferred in future it not be said that they were to be used in Vietnam.\\")<br />The war ended with an agreement attainable at any time, if the US Government had not had delusions of victory. Vietnam refused to negotiate while the bombing continued; it made no concessions to stop the bombing, and when talks resumed after the bombing it had not changed its position.<br />The book compares the bombing of Vietnam with the war against Iraq: here too, air power was not decisive: \\"The bombing did not cause the surrender of Iraq.\\" This is also a warning for us now: NATO air strikes on Serbia will not succeed: an air war, to achieve its stated objectives, will have to be followed by a ground war. And just why should British troops kill and be killed in Serbia?<br />This book, by focusing on the technical side of the war, fails to mention one outstanding fact: that the bombing, like the war itself, broke all international law and morality. As the American historian Henry Commager wrote \\"some wars are so deeply immoral that they must be lost, the war in Vietnam was one of those wars, and those who resist it are the truest patriots.\\" Successive US Governments failed in their immoral aims, and Vietnam won its unity, independence and sovereignty. As Ho Chi Minh said, \\"Nothing is more precious than independence and freedom.\\"	2001-07-31

This edition adds three new chapters, on the Intifada, on Israels 1993 attack on Lebanon, and on the peace process. It provides a vast wealth of information about Israels appalling treatment of the Palestinian people.<br />Chomsky also shows how the US state subsidises every Israeli attack on Lebanon, and how it pays for every prohibited biological weapon and every instrument of torture that its forces us. For 22 years now, Israeli forces have illegally occupied sovereign Lebanese territory. The war will only end when the Lebanese people finally expel the invader from their land.<br />Chomsky acknowledges that the Palestinian peoples courage and solidarity have forced the Israeli state to withdraw from Gaza and most of the West Bank. Their Intifada defeated what he rightly calls the US-Israeli strategy of integrating the occupied territories into Israel and ended Israels brutal and lawless occupation of those parts of Palestine.<br />Unfortunately though, Chomsky fails to appreciate that this was a great achievement. The peace agreements ratifying this were a big step forward, in the face of well-nigh overwhelming odds, towards the Palestinian peoples successful exercise of their right to national self-determination and sovereignty.<br />Like Edward Said (whom Pluto Press chose to write a Foreword), Chomsky attacks the agreements and the Palestinian peoples representative, the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Said says the agreements were an unnecessary line of Arab capitulation. But as Chomsky acknowledges, realistic alternatives may be much worse. If so, why publicly revile the PLO for signing the agreements?<br />Chomsky claims that the US state rules supreme and that all other states are mere agents and clients of the USA. According to this view, the PLO, like the Israeli Government, is a US puppet; further, any advance by the Palestinians or anybody else is plainly impossible, so it must be denied and reviled when it is achieved.

He has strong opinions, as when, possibly surprising some people, he attacks Thatcherism: In search of a guiding ideology, the Tories could come up with nothing better than the brute force of the market, whose inhuman logic of course ignores patriotism, morality, tradition and beauty.<br />He also makes some strong arguments against US-style ideologues of political correctness who denigrate Britains history, our literature and our traditional standards of courtesy and restraint. He argues for Britains unity and against relativist multiculturalism.<br />He links all these matters to the overriding question of whether Britain should join the euro: In the tremendous debate which must now begin on this, the most important decision the British people will take in this generation and many others, all the other reforms and upheavals in our daily life are involved. If we are what we used to be, then this is a last unrepeatable moment at which we can halt our extinction as a culture and a nation.<br />Hitchens concludes, The history of the world so far suggests that the nation-state is the largest unit in which it is possible to be unselfish to any effect. Within that state, of course, family disagreements can freely continue. But if we give up our nationhood, as the government now wants us to do, we will all of us, socialist or conservative, lose the right to influence the fate of our country. It will not matter if we want lower taxes or higher ones, more hospitals or more warships, smaller school classes or a new selective state education system. Under the plans for Economic and Monetary Union, we will pass these decisions to a supranational power where we will always be a minority voice, and where our specific British traditions are despised or unknown.	2001-07-31

They should not be seen as mini-adults, or as proto-adults. As a social group, they have specific relationships with other social groups, particularly with parents and teachers. She shows that children are agents, partners in constructing the social world that we all share. They are not just passive consumers of scarce social resources.<br />In fact though, they do receive inadequate support for their development. Resources for childrens health are poor, and so are the resources for childrens education. For instance, 94% of primary schools have no gym, 92% have no swimming pool, and 97% have no tennis courts.

This book focuses on Hitlers attempt to exterminate the Jews and on recent efforts by some French writers, principally Robert Faurisson, to negate this historical fact. Notoriously,  a group of French Trotskyists has consistently backed Faurisson. So too has the US academic Noam Chomsky, who describes Faurisson as an apolitical liberal when he has been well known in France as a pro-Nazi and anti-Semite since the late 1940s.<br />Finkielkraut explains that these leftists try to minimise Hitlers crimes in order to justify their dogmatic belief that all states are equally oppressive. They refuse to differentiate between fascism and democracy, between the Nazis and the Allies, or between Hitler and Stalin.<br />However, Finkielkraut himself negates World War Twos main result, Nazisms destruction. He thinks all politics still revolves round the question of racism, particularly anti-Semitism, writing that The Faurisson affair is therefore situated at the core of our intellectual lives. This overestimate of racisms importance corrodes all political judgments in the direction of liberalism.<br />For instance, the Introduction by Richard Golsan, a professor at Texas A&amp;M University, describes all struggle against capitalism as anti-Semitic. He writes of Wilhelm Liebknecht, the renowned German socialist leader: While the logic employed by Liebknecht is not overtly anti-Semitic, it is implicitly so to the extent that Jews were associated with capital and thereby implicated in the abuses of the latter in the suppression of the working class. This pro-capitalist flipside of liberalism also appears in Finkielkrauts sneers at dreams of revolution and his ritual slanders of the Soviet Union and Stalin.<br />History has moved on since Nazisms destruction, and all Europeans have other problems to deal with now, principally the threat to their nations sovereignty posed by Economic and Monetary Union.	2001-07-31

This is why, when the Austrian marginal utility school of economists were trying to refute the labour theory of value, at the same time, in the same city, the Viennese Circle of logical positivists were trying to empty the concept of value of any meaning.<br /> Ash refutes individualist approaches to ethics: Reducing politics to the question of individual rights is a way of evading real political issues, just as stressing the individual act avoids any consideration of the real problems of ethics. As long as the ruling class can limit political and moral criticism to the rights and duties of the individual they have effectively put their own interested acts as a class beyond the reach of working class criticism in social practice. So we read in the press endless discussions of the behaviour of the royals and of TV characters; individualism also results in support for single issue groups like Amnesty International.<br /> Ash concludes that our overarching moral imperative is to work to end capitalism. We must rebuild Britain and rebuild socialist consciousness in our class: the two tasks go hand in hand. There is a growing realisation that a system motivated primarily by private profit cannot achieve the social justice (either internally or in its relations with those under its economic domination) needed for equitable and peaceful development. Nor, as a system sacrificing everything to todays profits, can it nurture our worlds ecology or sustain our resources. Our planet is too small and crowded a place for classes mainly motivated by greed.

Well, they call themselves 'the great and the good'. They certainly preach a great deal of good, for ever propounding the virtues of insecurity and austerity for others, of security and wealth for themselves.<br />Conspicuous amongst them last year were representatives of two of the world's most arrogant Governments. Helmut Kohl was there promoting the euro, telling members that it would be introduced, whether the peoples of Europe liked it or not. And the US Ambassador to the United Nations boasted how he told the UN's members that \\"we will send the bombers no matter what you decide to do.\\"<br />Coincidentally, Thomas Mann set his great novel The Magic Mountain in Davos. There, his characters lived in states of advanced and terminal ennui, induced by their endless vague ratiocinations, but at least their deliberations did no harm to others: they suffered, but did not inflict suffering on others.<br />These modern cultists suffer the same ennui, induced by their endless seminars, networking and presentations.

He shows how the Soviet leadership integrated defence into their general economic planning and decision-making, and how well the defence industries met military requirements.<br />With the first five-year plan, the Soviet Union developed an advanced industrialised civilian economy. The vital machine building, automobile, tractor, chemical and aircraft industries could be swiftly mobilised in case of war. Samuelson argues that this did not lead to what could be called a `militarised economy', because the USA, France, Italy and Germany made similar preparations for the demands of total war.<br /> He also discusses Soviet strategic thinking. In the 1918-21 War of Intervention, the armies of fourteen capitalist states invaded Russia, trying to overthrow the revolutionary Government. This naturally confirmed the Soviet leadership's belief that these states would inevitably attack the new socialist state again. The debate raged - could the Soviet Union defeat such an attack? In 1927, Marshall Tukhachevskii, then Chief of Staff, said that the Soviet Union would be defeated, \\"unless the European revolution will come to our rescue.\\" In 1936, when he was Deputy Defence Commissar, he agreed with Trotsky that Nazi Germany would definitely defeat the Soviet Union. This consistent defeatism was hardly appropriate to a leading figure. Further, Tukhachevskii wanted the military, not civilians, to run military-industrial planning, a clear threat to the Party's leadership of the country.<br />Samuelson concludes, \\"With regard to industrial mobilisation, it [the Soviet Union] was certainly ahead of Germany - having adopted the best methods and techniques for preparing the economy in general, and industry in particular, for the test of wartime production conditions.\\" He sums up, \\"The presently available data give on the whole a more balanced and well-equipped Red Army on the eve of Operation Barbarossa than in the historiography of past decades.\\"and well-equipped Red Army on the eve of Operation Barbarossa than in the historiography of past decades.\\"	2001-07-31

But it also shows how the workers at Wisconsin Steel made two companies pay!<br />After 75 years of making profit out of the 3,500 workers of Wisconsin Steel in Chicago, its owners, the directors of International Harvester, decided to dump the plant in a phoney sale. They kept the mortgage on the mill, transferred ownership to Envirodyne, a consulting company with 20 employees and no steel making experience, and even lent it the money to buy the plant! They did this to try to cheat the workers out of the $45 million in benefits promised in their union contract. Two years later, they called in the mortgage and closed the mill without notice and without paying the workers severance pay or health benefits.<br />The workers there, led by Frank Lumpkin and the Save Our Jobs Committee, fought for 18 years to get the money they were owed, and to stop any company ever again dumping their workers. And they won - in 1988 they got Harvester to pay out $14.8 million, and in 1995 they forced Envirodyne to pay $4 million.<br />  They also fought the wider struggle to rebuild the citys industry and fabric, to get workers back into work on public works projects, where the steel they produced was indispensable. They realised that services depend on industry: like most US cities, Chicagos bridges, streets, sewers, schools, hospitals and houses need structural repairs that would use all the steel its mills could produce.<br />This book is also the story of Frank himself. He was one of the best workers, never late and never absent; his skills won him promotion to the tool room. He was always willing to pass on his skills to the younger generation, saying, If you have knowledge, you have responsibility to share that knowledge. You cant take it easy.

Third, Hurd's belief that active citizenship was compatible with free-market economics because private property gave the citizen a stake in the economic power of the country, simply did not work during the 1980s.\\"<br />Stuart writes, \\"The Conservative Party's raison d'etre in the late 1970s and during the 1980s became the defeat of organised labour.\\" But Thatcherism, the attack on organised labour, undermined all the institutions - family, community and nation - that Hurd claimed to support.<br />In passing, Stuart reveals something of Parliamentary `opposition'. On 21 January 1991, in the last Commons debate before the war against Iraq, Gerald Kaufman, Labour's Shadow Foreign Secretary, \\"asked Hurd to let him see the Government motion before they tabled it, to make sure it was one which the Opposition Front Bench could support.\\" Hurd then asked Kaufman to amend this motion, to prevent Labour backbenchers doing so. \\"Kaufman showed Hurd the revision beforehand to make sure his side could support it. So the Government drafted a motion subject to Labour's approval and Labour drafted an amendment subject to the Government's approval.\\"<br />As Foreign Secretary under Thatcher and Major, Hurd backed the onslaught on Iraq. He supported the EC's recognition of Croatia and Slovenia, which widened the Yugoslav  war. He backed Patten's mischief-making in Hong Kong. He supported the Maastricht Treaty.

Mind you, he also writes that the threat of disease has ended, when worldwide every day 33,000 children die from curable diseases, and that the threat of famine has ended, when 200 million children are undernourished. Should we call for an end to endism?<br />He says blithely that no more states will acquire nuclear weapons, but no sooner had he finished these lectures than the Indian and Pakistani Governments tested theirs. When writing about the arms trade, he does not mention the big three, USA, Britain and France (and who else could have sold India and Pakistan the components for their nuclear weapons?).<br />He writes that lethal weapons could soon be banned. But in the war against Iraq, US and British forces fired tens of thousands of depleted uranium shells, illegal under UN Resolution 32/84, which bans the use of `radioactive material weapons' and US forces also used chemical weapons. They are not about to destroy these weapons.<br />Keegan supports British forces' participation in yet more UN and NATO wars to end war. But a greater military historian, Correlli Barnett, argued in `The Lost Victory' that successive British Governments, from Attlee to Blair, damaged Britain's interests by acting this global military role.<br />Keegan's complacent judgements flow from his peculiar notion that \\"states, particularly those of Western Europe and North America, have been transforming themselves from belligerent to benevolent entities.\\" In fact,  since 1945 NATO powers have intervened in 243 conflicts, yet he writes that \\"poor states mainly cause war.\\"<br />Keegan is a distinguished military historian, with great narrative skills, as shown especially in the excellent `Six Armies in Normandy'.

He was the USAs best armour general, a master of fluid warfare, always attacking in the most unlikely places, constantly surprising the enemy. This excellent book gives a detailed account of the strength and structure of Pattons armies.<br /> In France during the First World War, Patton established a tank training school and commanded a tank brigade. At this time, the US Army treated tanks as a support to foot infantry. Patton made them the main component of a balanced, fully mobile, combined arms division made up of tanks, armoured infantry, armoured field artillery and armoured engineers, supported by tactical air, signals and logistics units.<br /> In 1942 and 1943, during the Second World War, he commanded US forces in Morocco, Tunisia, and Sicily. Early in 1944 he was given command of the 250,000 strong 3rd Army.  He made them one of the best organised, armed and equipped armies of the Allied armed forces and instilled them with great fighting spirit.  Success in battle proved how good his preparations were. 3rd Army played a key role in the headlong Allied armoured thrust to Germany after D-Day. In the summer of 1944 they broke through the Nazi defences in Normandy and advanced rapidly across France; in March 1945 they crossed the Rhine into Germany. They fought across France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia, liberating 82,000 square miles of territory including 1500 cities and towns.<br />  They captured 1.28 million prisoners of  war, killed 47,500 and wounded 115,700 enemy soldiers.	2001-07-31

His book is largely an attack on the theory of cultural evolutionism, defended by Herbert Spencer, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung and Arthur Koestler among other discredited thinkers.<br />Cultural evolutionism applied the idea of evolution mechanically to cultural phenomena. It claimed that every civilisation, whatever its cirumstances, developed through the same sequence of stages - agriculture, cities, literacy, etc. It was based on Lamarck&#8217;s theory (refuted by modern genetics) of the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Kraus rightly argues that we need historical explanations for the development of civilisations, not metaphysical ones.<br />We are all one race, the social animal Homo sapiens. All contemporary human groups, whatever their cultural status, are now recognised as biological equals irrespective of their ethnological or geographical origins. &#8216;Western civilisation&#8217; is not the most advanced: all societies are contemporary.<br />Kraus writes that &#8220;what humans all over the world must be made aware of is that, whatever their racial and other diverse origins, they are basically the same.&#8221; But a realisation of our common humanity is not enough. Our opinions about other civilisations and nations do not cause wars, so ending racism would not end wars.<br />Kraus concludes by asking, &#8220;What then is the solution? Many prominent military observers in the USA believe that it is to invite Russia to become an integral part of the NATO alliance.&#8221; &#8220;This act of political and military co-operation could become a unifying factor of global significance, affording an opportunity of solving all the other problems which plague humanity in future.

It starts from the facts that the present economic system prevents full employment, and that the working class as a whole is becoming surplus to requirements. There are now 18 million unemployed people in the EU alone. It is increasingly a world in which workers have no place at all, especially our young people. An OECD Jobs Study openly recommended raising unemployment to cut wages. The World Bank openly recommended cutting benefits to force workers into low-paid jobs, and said that \\"wage cuts and redundancies [are] essential.\\"<br /> Unfortunately, Ms Forrester argues that we must accept ever-growing unemployment. Instead of working out ways to end mass unemployment, she proposes, in characteristic post-modernist style, to end the `culture' of employment. She writes that our terms of work and unemployment `created such reality', so if we stop using the terms, we change the reality! She calls for \\"organising society starting precisely from the absence of work.\\" According to her, unemployed people do not need work; they need instead to free themselves from the very idea of work.<br /> She seems unaware of the paradox that she has produced a book - which is work - calling for everyone to recognise the end of work! Not surprisingly, she never mentions the words `manufacturing' or industry': the idea that things are made and need making never seems to strike her.<br /> But of course there is an alternative. We can change our ideology to change the world. Workers do have the right to work; we must organise to reclaim that right. We need to rebuild our industry, in order to rebuild our society. Work needs to be done: improving the environment and our transport services, building homes, schools and hospitals, developing education and culture. How can society survive without work? Jobs need doing, and people need to work. So let's put the two together!	2001-07-31

It traces the rise of anti-Communist dissent, the dissolution of the socialist societies and their disintegration into the poverty-stricken chaos that we see today.<br />The enforcers from the International Monetary Fund are only temporarily, we hope, in control there, imposing cuts in wages and welfare spending, privatising and deregulating. They are trying to destroy all collective thought and action, and all peaceful coexistence between peoples and nations. The result is commonly described as shock without the therapy.<br />The US Government and its NATO allies used `dissidents' to attack independent states and progressive governments, just as scabs are used against trade union struggles. The dissidents themselves are not the daring, creative individuals of their own legends; they are sterile oppositionists, now drowning in a tidal wave of the crassest commercial garbage from the West.<br />The censorship that the dissidents used indiscriminately to attack is now used against the working class's organisations and publications. The laws that prevented fanning religious, racial and national hatreds have vanished: the fomentors of these violent hatreds, pornographers, and criminals are now running private fiefdoms, little military and commercial empires of corruption.<br />In Britain, the dissidents' supporters found it easy to support human rights abroad and condemn abuses abroad. They paid just lip-service to opposing the destruction of freedoms at home, and to fighting Thatcher's imposition of the most restrictive laws against unions in Europe. They praised Solidarnosc, while doing nothing about Thatcher's attempted destruction of Britain's trade unions, local government and civil liberties.<br />What lessons can we learn from the events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union? Primarily, that we must ceaselessly search for improvements in the party's relations with the class. There no models for this, just as there are no models for society as a whole. We cannot just import wholesale whatever they did in  the Soviet Union, or China, or Cuba. Nor can we look to others for example, as some do to the USA or the European Union.<br />We must build on the unique strengths of the British working class. We have to develop  a style of work that draws on the strengths of the class, that encourages initiatives from all. We must build on our class's sense of fairness and justice, on the positive attitude to work, on the infinite varieties of workers' skills, and on respect for equality of being.<br />The British working class is worthy of all respect, for its two-hundred year struggle for existence, to create independent organisations of its own, for the civil liberties necessary to function - presumption of innocence, freedom from arbitrary arrest, trial by jury.

His earlier books, such as 'Labouring Men', 'The Age of Revolution (1789-1848)' and 'Industry and Empire', made solid contributions to the history of the 19th and 20th centuries without attracting such attention. But his new book has won the Lionel Gelber Prize for the year's outstanding book in the field of international relations. It is one of The Spectator's Books of the Year, and it is massively displayed in major bookshops.<br /> Why all this publicity? Because his main theme now is different from that of his earlier books. It is also a very fashionable theme: the end of ideology. He brilliantly charts capitalism's failures, but he wrongly sees it as unstoppable.<br /> In his book, he divides the century into three parts: 1914-1945 a landscape of disaster, 1945-1973 a golden age of peace and plenty, and 1973-1991 a slide towards the abyss. To see no progress between 1914 and 1945 overlooks the Soviet Union's achievements and the other struggles, especially China's and Spain's against fascist aggression. In portraying 1945-1973 as a golden age of peace, he ignores the USA's wars against China, Korea and Vietnam, the many British, French and Dutch colonial wars and Israel's three Middle Eastern wars. Further, he ignored the internal struggles led by the working class inside countries, struggles that  ended colonialism and won reforms after the Second World War. And he pictures the period from 1973 to 1991 as dominated by the slow collapse of the Soviet Union, while capitalism got more and more out of control.<br /> Hobsbawm, who was a member of the deceased Communist Party of Great Britain, saw the Soviet Union as the only barrier to the triumph of capitalism. When the Soviet Union collapsed, so too, in his view, did all prospects of resisting capitalism: hope died with the Soviet Union.<br /> But his outlook is unnecessarily pessimistic. Are there really no other forces fighting capitalism? There are, but Hobsbawm fails to recognise and understand them. Workers' nationalism and the trade unions are both hostile to capitalism. The workers of Europe, especially now those of France, Italy and Belgium, are in ferment, struggling for their national independence against the capitalist ramp of Economic and Monetary Union. There is deep-seated hatred of, and struggle against, capitalism in the working class of every country, born of the necessities of the daily struggle against the employer. Struggles are arising again in Britain. There are good grounds for optimism.<br /> This book is brilliantly expressed, but it is dispirited in content and ideas, and demoralising in effect. And a cry of despair, however eloquent, is not a good guide to action.er forces fighting capitalism? There are, but Hobsbawm fails to recognise and understand them.

Sir John Barrow, Second Secretary to the Admiralty from 1816 to 1848, launched the most ambitious programme of global exploration that the world has ever seen. When he started, atlases were still pocked with blanks, virtually marked here be dragons. Was the North Pole water, a rock or a continent? Was there a North-West Passage? Did Antarctica exist? Where did the Niger go? Where on earth was Timbuctoo?<br />The Royal Navy, the worlds largest navy, had little to do after the Battle of Trafalgar. The sailors were laid off, dumped on the streets whence they had been press-ganged. Barrow found the officers an outlet for their aspirations to heroism: exploration became their system of outdoor relief.<br />Barrows first venture, in 1816, to find the Niger, ended in disaster, as yellow fever killed nearly all the crew. In 1818, he sent the first of his many doomed expeditions to find the fabled North-West Passage between Canada and Greenland. (He hoped that a link between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans would ease British access to the treasures of the East.) In 1819, so badly organised was John Franklins overland expedition through Canada that he ended up literally eating his boots. In 1826, Gordon Laing became the first white man ever to reach Timbuctoo, but was killed weeks later. In 1830, the Lander brothers travelled down the Niger to the sea. The 1848 Antarctica expedition discovered the volcanic Mount Erebus; it also discovered that Antarctica was cold, useless and there. Barrow ended with yet another disaster, the deaths in the Arctic of all Franklins team.<br />Fleming uses their diaries, journals, letters and memoirs to depict these obsessive, ludicrous, heroic explorers, to tell their tales of courage, endurance and devotion to duty. Barrow was indeed the father of world exploration, yet his every goal proved practically useless, from Timbuctoo to the North-West Passage that could not be passed.

He was capable of an extraordinarily sensitive empathy with people, especially with those who did the work of the Empire, the doctors, engineers and administrators. But his political sympathies constrained his emotional sympathies. His love for the Empire was twisted in with a most unintelligent hero-worship of the scoundrels who ran it, and with hatred for those who opposed it.<br />His works reflect this ambiguity. Many of his writings are excellent, for instance the Jungle Book, some of his stories and many of his poems. Lycett has presented an amazingly detailed portrait of Kipling&#8217;s adopted class and milieu. But he lacks a novelist&#8217;s imagination and ease with language; the biography often just lists Kipling&#8217;s possessions, travels, guests and friends. In reflection of Kipling, he smothers his finer understandings in a blanket of conventions. We still need Angus Wilson&#8217;s fine book, &#8216;The strange ride of Rudyard Kipling&#8217;, to see the full peculiarity of Kipling&#8217;s career.	2001-07-31

The authors are Brian Fugate, a distinguished American military historian, and Lev Dvoretsky, a retired Russian colonel and military historian.<br />They present their findings in their opening words: It is an enduring myth of the twentieth century that the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 caught Stalin and the Red Army totally by surprise. Their work demolishes this myth, sponsored by Khrushchev and repeated by virtually every historian since. For example, they found the logbook of Stalins appointments: he had meetings with thirteen political and military leaders on 21 June, and with nineteen on 22 June, which disproves Khrushchevs claim that panic immobilised Stalin after the invasion.<br />The book shows that the invasion did not catch Stalin and the Soviet High Command off guard: they had developed a skilful, innovative and highly secret plan to oppose it. This plan ensured that the Soviet Union would not only survive the biggest and most violent invasion in history, but would also defeat it. They developed the key elements of the strategy during three war games held in January and February 1941, probably the most important war games ever played.<br />The Red Army considered war games the ultimate form of strategic planning, the best way to test alternative strategies. General Pavlov, Commander of the Western Front, advocated a forward strategy of defending Bialystok, which jutted 150 miles into the Nazi-controlled part of Poland, following with a counterattack into Germany. This strategy meant placing the Red Armys main forces near the border. Marshal Timoshenko, commissar for defence, and General Zhukov, head of the Kiev Special Military District, proposed placing their main forces deep in Soviet territory for an active strategic defence. This would create the conditions for a counterattack by the strategic reserve that would sweep the invader out of the Soviet Union and destroy the core of his army. The general staff put the current military situation on the map board, then launched the Nazi attack and played out the moves, testing the two strategies.<br />The first game tested Pavlovs strategy. Zhukov led the German forces and broke through Pavlovs defences, surrounding and annihilating them. The second game tested the Zhukov-Timoshenko strategy. Zhukov led the Red Army against Pavlovs German forces which had advanced deep into the Soviet Union. Zhukov counterattacked, outflanked and defeated Pavlovs forces. The day after the Politburo received the reports of these games, it appointed Zhukov chief of the general staff.<br />  The authors discovered details of the third game in Timoshenkos and Zhukovs private papers. It tested a more developed version of the in-depth strategy, with a defence zoned in three echelons (see Map). The first, tactical, echelon was behind the border. The first strategic echelon was 200 to 300 miles behind the first, on the upper Dnepr. This launched a powerful counterattack against the southern flank of Army Group Centre as it crossed to the north of the Pripyat Marshes. The second strategic echelon was a mobile reserve, massed around Moscow, ready to attack the flanks of the enemy as he advanced towards Moscow. The plan worked in the game: the Red Armys forces were placed accordingly.<br />The Red Army carried out this strategy in July and August 1941. It successfully counterattacked the southern flank of Army Group Centre as it moved along the upper Dnepr, delaying its advance on Moscow. The delay enabled the forces in the second strategic echelon virtually to destroy Army Group Centre at Moscow in December. As a result of adopting this strategy, The war was essentially won in 1941 along the upper Dneprand at Moscow.<br />The authors conclude, the USSR was as well prepared for war in June 1941 as it possibly could have been.r and at Moscow. <br />The authors conclude, the USSR was as well prepared for war in June 1941 as it possibly could have been.	2001-07-31

Minnie inspired James to create the characters of Isabel Archer, the heroine of The Portrait of a Lady, and of Milly Theale, the heroine of The Wings of the Dove.<br />Both Minnie and Constance looked to James for more than he was prepared to give. He drew them into communion, then left them exposed when he withdrew into the sanctuary of his writing. Minnie died of tuberculosis in 1870 at the age of 25, after James rejected her pleas for a closer relationship; her consequent loss of morale accelerated her death. After fifteen years of friendship with James, Constance killed herself in 1894 at the age of 52. Their tragic deaths spurred his creativity.<br /> James greatest achievements depended on their generosity: the idea of the solitary genius is just a myth: genius cannot emerge in a void. He paid them the supreme artistic tribute of portraying them forever as heroines, but he paid them too little attention as real women. He rejected what few but he knew that they offered. He understood the claims that they made on life, but would not, could not, meet them. James visionary moralism was born of his merciless clairvoyance.<br />These two wonderful independent-minded women provoked James creative attention; they figured for him creative possibilities that he celebrated in his greatest fiction. They enabled him to understand a womans point of view, a perspective that became central to his art. Like George Eliot and Charles Dickens, James exposed the social corruption and moral bankruptcy of the bourgeois men and women of his time. But only James and Eliot, with Dorothea Brooke in Middlemarch and Gwendolen Harleth in Daniel Deronda, created heroines who transcended the limits of their society. In each of these novels, the heroines integrity and altruism rise above the bullying interference and interests of others.	2001-07-31

They fought against Franco; they also fought against Hitler's and Mussolini's armies; they also fought against the Governments of Britain, France and the United States, which did so much to assist the forces of fascist aggression.<br /> &quot;But the remarkable thing was that though fully conscious of the odds against us and though suffering staggering losses in long, drawn out gruelling campaigns, we all went back to the front time after time ... always with a belief in the possibility of victory.&quot; This was the testimony of Milton Wolff, the last commander of the Lincoln-Washington battalion. As Carroll wrote, &quot;the Americans remained in action, constantly facing superior firepower. As in previous engagements, they demonstrated remarkable courage and stamina; they held difficult positions against overwhelming odds.&quot; They were finally withdrawn from Spain after the two-month Battle of the Ebro in late 1938: &quot;the Americans under Wolff held fast and waited. They were still there when a relief column came to replace them; only then did they withdraw from the lines.&quot;<br /> Within the Republican forces, it was the Communists who fought longest and hardest against Franco. What is amazing is that they fought so well for so long against such odds, not that they lost. How could they have fought any better? If they had followed the line of revolution now, war later, Franco would surely have won more quickly and easily. This approach would have lost them the support of those in Spain who wanted the Republic but were not yet ready for revolution. This approach would have made support or even genuine neutrality from other Governments even less likely. It would have increased the intensity of German, Italian, British, French and US Government support for Franco. It is quite possible that the British, French and US Governments would have abandoned even the pretence of neutrality and joined in the attack on Spain, just as they had in 1918-1922 when they jointly attacked the Soviet Union.<br /> The British, French and US Governments used Hitler and Mussolini as their hired goons to attack Spain, just as they tried to use them later to attack the Soviet Union. (And just as they now use other goons in other countries.) In June 1940 when Roosevelt accused Mussolini of stabbing France in the back, former brigade commissar John Gates replied truly, &quot;It was you who stabbed Republican Spain in the back. It was you, and the British and French rulers, who provided Mussolini with the dagger that he has now proceeded to plunge into your own backs.&quot;<br /> When the Brigade left, La Pasonaria spoke: &quot;We shall not forget you and when the olive tree of peace puts forth its leaves again, entwined with the laurels of the Spanish Republic's victory - come back! ... Come back to us. With us those of you who have no country will find one, those of you who have to live deprived of friends will find friends, and all of you will find the love and gratitude of the whole Spanish people who, now and in the future, will cry out with all their hearts: Long live the heroes of the International Brigades!&quot;<br /> She said, &quot;They gave up everything, their loves, their countries, home and fortune; fathers, mothers, wives, brothers, sisters and children, and they came and told us: &quot;We are here. Your cause, Spain's cause, is ours - it is the cause of all advanced and progressive mankind.' You can go proudly. You are history. You are legend.&quot;<br /> After the war, they fought on against the enemies of Spain and of all progressive mankind in America. Bill McCarthy said in 1990, &quot;We have to do our fighting right here. There's no use being discouraged because victory is ours if we fight for it.&quot; Milton Woolf, who had not completed high school, said, &quot;Spain was only one battle. World War Two was only one battle, what's going on in Central America, South Africa, the Middle East now is another battle, and we're into those things. Struggle is the elixir of life, the tonic of life. I mean, if you're not struggling, you're dead.&quot;<br /> 'Say not the struggle nought availeth.' Spain (not Munich) gave Britain the time and opportunity to rearm. Spain damaged Mussolini so much that his intervention on Hitler's side was more hindrance than help. Franco too could do little to help his sponsors. Veterans of the Brigade fought Franco to the end. After his death, his monstrous regime crumbled away to nothing.

Ben-Zvi recounts how at first the US Government sought to contain the supposed Soviet threat to the Middle East by uniting the nations of the region, and saw Israel as a hindrance to this.<br />But the anti-colonial revolutions of 1957-58 destroyed this policy. The US Government moved to support `moderate' Arab regimes against Arab nationalism. In April 1957, President Eisenhower sent the US 6th Fleet to help King Hussein of Jordan, and $30 million aid, after Hussein had dismissed the elected Government and declared martial law. Eisenhower then got Turkey, Iraq and Jordan to mobilise their armed forces against Syria, after nationalist forces gained power there.<br />In July 1958, the Iraqi people overthrew their pro-British Government. The US Government sent 14,000 troops to Lebanon to threaten Iraq, also to prevent revolution in Lebanon. The British Government sent 2,200 paratroops to Jordan to help Hussein: Israel allowed them to fly their troops in through Israeli airspace. This convinced the US Government that it should support Israel.<br />In August 1962, President Kennedy decided to sell Hawk anti-aircraft missiles to Israel, hoping it would then let the US inspect Israel's nuclear weapons facilities at Dimona and would allow 100,000-150,000 Palestinians to return home. Israel rejected both proposals, yet still got the Hawks.<br />This set a pattern for the next 35 years: Israel received huge military and economic support, but made no policy concessions. The US Government developed Israel as its military proxy in the Middle East, however unpopular this made Israel, and the USA. The costs to the region have been enormous: regular wars, the continual repression of the Palestinians, lack of political and economic progress. But this policy finally failed in the Gulf War, when the USA had to keep Israel out of the coalition against Iraq, for fear of wrecking it.	2001-07-24

The US state, assisted by Thatcher, trained and armed almost a quarter of a million Islamic mercenaries drawn from around the world to fight against Afghani national liberation. It was not supporting a `jihad' but manipulating dupes, just as it has used other groups to fight proxy wars in Africa and Asia, colonial wars it labelled wars against communism.<br />The US state intervened first in Afghanistan. On 3 July 1979, President Carter signed a secret directive authorising covert aid to the mujehadin. The CIA promoted drug traffic in the Golden Crescent to raise funds for them. The Egyptian, Saudi, British, French and Israeli Governments all sold them arms. The CIA supported their sabotage and guerrilla operations inside the Soviet Union. Only in December 1979, five months after the US intervention, did Soviet troops enter Afghanistan.<br />The war's effects on Afghanistan have been terrible: four million refugees, the land in ruins, continued strife even after the Soviet Union withdrew its troops, the Taliban dominating vast areas of the country. Further afield, the US-created mercenaries have destabilised Algeria, Chechenya, and the former Central Asian Republics of the Soviet Union, among others. Some of them tried to create a separatist `Eastern Turkestan' in China's Western region of Xinjiang. However, China has defeated these efforts, and the Algerian Government succeeded in quelling the reactionary forces trying to overthrow it.<br />In this book, Cooley portrays the US state as a good sorcerer, who mistakenly released shadowy yet invincible forces, which it is now trying to crush. He pretends that the mercenaries are now separate from and opposed to the US state. In fact, the mercenaries are doing just what the US state wants, trying to destabilise any Government in the world that shows any sign of independence. So Cooley's book both prettifies the US's real foreign policy, and tries to legitimise its globocop role.n policy, and tries to legitimise its globocop role.	2001-07-24

Unemployment, reaching more than 10% in 1984 (and never falling since), has constantly fuelled the Front's vote. Indeed, it first came to prominence in 1984, winning 10.95% of the total vote in the elections to the European Parliament - paradoxically, a success in a foreign assembly! Front leaders noted that the EU system of proportional representation was the most important factor in their success. Ever since 1984, the European Parliament has been the key forum for those organising trans-European cooperation among the extreme right.<br />In the early 1990s, in all the members the European Union, membership and the preparations for the euro, twin threats to national independence and sovereignty, upset more and more people. These preparations included cuts in unemployment (and other) benefits, increased medical costs, reductions in holidays, and less job security. Between 1989 and 1994, a huge number of people began to oppose the EU across Europe: in France support fell by 18%. In the 1980s, the Front had been pro-EU and pro-euro (showing how false was its patriotism). Now, opportunistically, it started to follow the anti-EU tide.<br />Actually, the Front's neo-liberal economic programme is the centre of its doctrine, not its purported nationalism; it is pro-employer, anti-trade union, pro-privatisation. The Front is anticommunist because its members mistakenly think that communism is not patriotic. National self-respect does not depend on overseas possessions but on the struggles, achievements and skills of the nation itself. However, the purist attitudes of the French Communist Party and the Socialist Party on the matters of immigration and asylum have played into the Front's hands.<br />DeClair ends his book dramatically by writing \\"Ominously, the future does indeed belong to the National Front.\\" He then had to write an afterword, because in January this year, the Front wrecked itself by splitting!splitting!	2001-07-24

He argues that the member governments chose ever closer union in order to promote their countries' economic interests. He aims to prove that economic interests, not political ideas, drive EU integration. He focuses on how the governments of Germany, France and Britain made their decisions.<br />Moravcsik argues that the British government's policy in the 1950s of opposition to joining the Common Market \\"was the rational one for a government that traded little with the Continent, had high tariffs in place, and feared competition with German producers.\\" So there was economic logic to staying out. It is less clear that there was good reason for the subsequent reversal of policy: trading with a bloc does not oblige us to join it!<br />He shows that De Gaulle vetoed Britain's application not out of chauvinism, but because we opposed generous financing for French farmers through the Common Agricultural Policy. In 1969, Pompidou lifted the veto, but only in exchange for the British government's huge concession of agreeing to a permanent financing arrangement for the CAP. This made it CAP reform impossible.<br /> Similarly, member governments have pursued integration through creating the Single Market and EMU. Moravcsik shows how Europe's multinational companies and the national employers' organisations backed integration. The European Commission admitted, \\"The single market programme has done more for business than it has for workers\\", a judgment true also of Economic and Monetary Union. Economic interests may well have determined the drive to a single state, but paradoxically the closer the cooperation between EU members has become, the worse their economies have performed.<br /> Capitalist states and multinational companies have taken the EU road to lost sovereignty and economic integration, but the peoples of Europe are increasingly choosing otherwise, as the Irish people showed in the 7 June referendum on the Nice Treaty.

He estimates that the famines killed perhaps 50 million people in Asia alone. The causes were disruptions - El Ninos - of the global climatic system, which have occurred throughout history. The trend is towards more frequent and more destructive events.<br />Responding to famines in pre-British India, its Moghul rulers embargoed food exports, regulated prices, distributed food for free, and relaxed tax collection. Similarly in the 17th and 18th centuries, the Chinese state managed effective famine relief and flood control systems. But the British state's occupation of India and its Opium and Arrow wars against China destroyed all these systems.<br />Britain's rulers took advantage of the disasters to fasten their grip even more tightly on both their formal and informal empires. They used the Indian Famine Fund to pay for their imperial wars. During the famines, they allowed merchants to export grain reserves, ended free food distribution, and maintained, or even increased, tax collection.<br />Viceroy Curzon said, \\"any Government which by indiscriminate alms-giving weakened the fibre and demoralised the self-reliance of the population, would be guilty of a public crime.\\" The 1901 Famine Commission Report ludicrously said, \\"the relief distributed was excessive.\\" The Irish called it `famine political economy'. But there was no such parsimony in raising a War Fund for the attack on the Boers, nor in the millions spent on Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee ceremonies.<br />From 1757 to 1947, India's per capita income failed to improve. In the last half of the 19th century, India's income fell by 50%; life expectancy fell by 20% between 1872 and 1921; the population hardly grew. There were 17 serious famines in the 2000 years before British rule, but 31 in the 120 years of British rule. Empire, not Asia's `immemorial' traditions, or overpopulation, kept India poor.

Geoffrey Roberts' essay on Soviet foreign policy and the Spanish civil war is particularly fascinating. He shows that in 1938 the British government successfully pressed the French government to close its Spanish border, ending supplies from the Republic's only supporter, the Soviet Union. He concludes that Soviet participation in the Non-Intervention Committee prevented the British and French governments from reaching an agreement with Hitler and Mussolini over Spain.  Roberts writes of \\"the Soviet belief that the way to deal with the fascist powers was to stand up to them.\\" He sums up: \\"Soviet policy towards Spain followed a relatively simple and straightforward course. Given the constraints of real-world diplomacy and politics and perceptions of its own and republican interests, Moscow did what it could to aid the anti-fascist cause in Spain.\\"  Enrique Moradiellos' brilliant essay on the British government's non-intervention policy during the civil war shows how its aim was Franco's victory. As Lord Hailsham said, \\"Cabinet would love to see the earliest possible victory for General Franco.\\" The policy also rehearsed a non-intervention policy encouraging Hitler to attack the Soviet Union.  Paul Preston's fine essay on Franco's overall foreign policy notes that in June 1940, Franco \\"changed Spain's official neutrality to the much more pro-Axis position of non-belligerency.\\" Churchill described what this meant: \\"Throughout the war German influence in Spain has been consistently allowed to hinder the war effort of Great Britain and her allies and it is a fact that a Spanish division was sent to fight our Russian allies.\\" Churchill also dismissed as worthless Franco's neutral posture during the Allied North African campaign. Throughout the war, Franco aided Hitler, providing him with bases to refuel the U-boats attacking British Atlantic shipping, selling him raw materials, giving him intelligence information, and constantly threatening France.  Qasim Ahmad shows how, after the war, Franco switched protectors, relying first on the British government, then on the USA, to defend his rule against the people.el the U-boats attacking British Atlantic shipping, selling him raw materials, giving him intelligence information, and constantly threatening France.

The spin tries to cover up their, and their agents' crimes, whose casualties are `collateral damage'; the enemy's crimes, exaggerated and fabricated, are always `genocidal'. NATO nowadays claims that it may intervene wherever it likes, whenever human rights are in peril. But this reborn, `ethical', imperialism fools few. The South Summit of 2000, of 133 nations comprising 80% of the world's peoples, declared, \\"We reject the so-called `right' of humanitarian intervention.\\" Last year, Nelson Mandela accused the British and US governments of \\"encouraging international chaos by ignoring other nations and playing `policeman of the world'.\\" He said that he resented their \\"riding roughshod over the United Nations and launching military actions against Iraq and Kosovo.\\"  Chomsky notes that in 1994 the Turkish state's repression peaked, and also in 1994 Turkey became the world's largest arms importer, 80% from the USA. In 1999, Colombia became the leading recipient of US `aid', after a decade of the worst repression in the Western hemisphere, killing over 3,500 people and displacing two million. For the last forty years, the Indonesian army has relied on the US and British states for its training, funds and supplies. They aided its bloody coup in 1965, its invasion of Timor in 1979, and its murderous assaults on East Timor in 1999. After this last crime, but only after it, the US state cancelled its cooperation with the Indonesian army, which at once withdrew from East Timor. So the US could have prevented the crime, had it wished.  Chomsky denounces the illegal NATO attack on Yugoslavia. He observes that the two key State Department reports and the International War Crimes Tribunal indictment of Milosevic and his associates focus almost entirely on their actions after the NATO bombing started on 24 March 1999. So, logically, those actions could not have been the reason for NATO's decision to attack.

It covers the historical development of the state in the global economy since the 18th century, the relationships of states, sovereignty and capital accumulation, regional issues of globalisation, and the recent changes in global information technology and financial practices. It also presents case studies of the European Union, Central and Eastern Europe, Mexico, Southeast Asia, China and Africa.<br />While written from a perspective critical of neoliberalism, as are most studies with any claim to scholarship, it merely describes the realities it deplores, without exploring the possibilities of change. Probably the best book in this field is Globalisation and progressive economic policy, edited by Dean Baker, Gerald Epstein and Robert Pollin, published by the Cambridge University Press in 1998.<br />Vivien A. Schmidt, in a fascinating chapter on France, Great Britain, and Germany between globalization and Europeanization, scotches the myth that the EU has anything to do with workers' rights or democracy. She concludes, \\"The European Union in particular has afforded European business unprecedented supranational policy-making access and influence at the same time that it has reduced national government policy-making autonomy.\\"<br />Eric Helleiner shows that those who gain from financial globalisation frequently overstate its effect on macroeconomic policy autonomy. He shows that the notorious Mitterand U-turn towards capital liberalisation was not forced by capital flight, but by the European Monetary System, which kept the franc in tight limits. By contrast, Sweden and Norway, which were not in the EMS, kept their currencies floating, allowing them sustained growth throughout the 1970s and 1980s.<br />The authors show that globalisation is not some automatic, irresistible process. It is a bogy, to frighten us into believing that capital is all-powerful. Capitalist states, primarily the USA and Britain, created the global financial institutions, the World, the IMF and the World Trade Organization, to strengthen the employers against workers, their trade unions, their industries and services.

He marshals extensive cross-country evidence and concludes, \\"The results showed a strong positive correlation between sovereignty and industrialisation.\\"<br />As he writes, \\"Sovereignty did matter! Countries which had it would grow faster than countries which did not. The logic of it is simple. Colonization of lagging countries led, via forced integration, to the loss of manufactures, a shrinking comparative advantage in primary production, and the displacement of indigenous capital, skills and enterprises; it also led to monopolization and direct appropriation of their resources. Only sovereign lagging countries - free to structure their integration into the world economy - could avoid or minimize the adverse consequences of integration. Ergo, loss of sovereignty retarded economic growth. ... Countries will structure their international relations to develop manufactures and indigenous capital, enterprises and technological capabilities; they will impose at the outset, or gradually, policies that regulate the entry of imports and foreign capital, labor and enterprises. ... These asymmetries ensure that loss of sovereignty will produce lower levels of industrialisation, lower levels of productivity in the subsistence sector, lower levels of human capital, lower rates of taxation and public expenditure and, finally, lower growth rates of per capita income.\\"<br /> Countries winning their independence after 1945 achieved substantial increases in their manufacturing industry. 1980 saw the imperial counterattack; the international financial institutions, egged on by the key capitalist states, attacked the lagging countries and reimposed dependency. The Soviet Union's demise orphaned the lagging countries; they lost the most powerful counterweight to the USA.<br />World Bank and IMF policy packages are identical to the EU's demands: end fiscal deficits, privatise industries and services, open government contracts to foreign firms, end state subsidies, remove controls on capital accounts of the balance of payments, end barriers to foreign enterprises' entry.<br />Without economic sovereignty, all other forms of sovereignty are shadows.

Books	5	5	5	N	N	Fine critique of neoliberalism	This book comes to sensible conclusions by an unusual, though fascinating, route. Professor Snook's theme is that neoliberal economics, with its routine prescription of zero inflation, privatisation, free trade, flexible labour markets, and reduced wages, is bad for us. This capitalist monetarism dominates the international institutions, the World Bank, the IMF, the OECD and the EU, and also almost all current national governments: in effect, the monetarists impose the notorious Structural Adjustment Programs on all economies.  Snooks observes that national governments have generally abandoned strategic leadership of their national societies and economies, and that this threatens both economic growth and political freedom. He notes that neoliberals \\"insist that central banks controlled by their fellow neoliberals be totally independent of political - that is, democratic - control.\\" He warns us, \\"to grant central banks - organizations not responsible to society's strategists - the independence to suppress inflation at any cost is an invitation to disrupt the dynamic process.\\"  He points out that neoliberals constantly warn us about future economic crises if we do not obey their dictates, but their proposed cure actually produces these crises. Neoliberalism destroys wealth, by destroying the necessary conditions of economic growth. He warns that neo-liberalism's failures will lead to economic collapse, the destruction of democracy, and wars of conquest. He maintains that there is no Third Way; there is only the neoliberal way and the strategic way, the wrong way and the right way.  So what is this strategic way? \\"Strategic leadership ... involves investing in strategic infrastructure (including science, research, education, transport and communication facilities) where the social return is expected to exceed the private return; encouraging domestic innovations and their marketing; promoting strategic ideas; spearheading the penetration of new markets by negotiating external trade and technology deals.\\" Countries need \\"a protectionist strategy aimed at developing an innovative industrial base.\\" We all need to focus on strategic ideas, without neglecting technological ideas.

In wonderfully vigorous prose, they celebrate the defiant spirit of the untameable Promethean multitudes who ended slavery, and created the ideas of cooperative political economy and culture, of those who &#8216;dare seize the fire&#8217;, in William Blake&#8217;s words.<br />They trace the bloody birth of capitalism in 17th century England, and how capitalism spread through trade and colonisation around the Atlantic, expropriating the commoners of England, Ireland, Africa, Barbados and Virginia and imposing slavery. The years 1680 to 1760 saw the rise of the British maritime state: by the 1690s, the Royal Navy was Britain&#8217;s largest employer. The authors ...cite James Rawley&#8217;s comment, &#8220;In the decade of the 1730s England had become the supreme slaving nation in the Atlantic world&#8221;, though surely England&#8217;s ruling class, not the nation, owned the slave ships and ran the plantations.<br />They tell the stories of the waves of slave revolts and urban insurrections in 1730s and 1740s throughout British, French, Spanish, Dutch and Danish possessions, notably the New York Conspiracy of 1741 and Jamaica&#8217;s Maroon War of the 1730s. In the 1760s and 1770s another wave of slaves&#8217; rebellions provided the arsenal of ideas that inspired the American, French and Haitian Revolutions.<br />Linebaugh and Rediker vividly depict the struggle against slavery and empire, against the pressgangs and brutality of the owners and employers. They show how sailors organised themselves, &#8216;a motley crew&#8217;, composed of people from all nations. When London&#8217;s sailors in 1768 struck (lowered) their sails, they added another weapon, and word, to the workers&#8217; armoury.

Taylor	Books	5	22	23	N	N	The best biography of the best British historian	This is a beautifully written biography of the most famous British historian of the twentieth century. It takes its place as the best book on Taylor, far better than the earlier books by Robert Cole and Adam Sisman. Kathleen Burk, similarly a prolific and professional historian, is especially good on Taylor's methods of work, and on the importance of his contributions to historical knowledge and debate.  Taylor was one of the best ever diplomatic historians, yet he was also an inspirational populariser of history. He combined excellent scholarship with an unusual ability to make history accessible, through his many books, newspaper articles, book reviews, lectures at universities, speeches at meetings, and radio and TV talks and appearances.  Diplomatic history is rather unfashionable today, but, as he wrote, it \\"deals with the greatest of themes - with the relations of States, with peace and war, with the existence and destruction of communities and civilisations.\\" He analysed the profound and specific causes of historical events, so we can say that imperialism ensures that there will be wars, yet that each particular war occurs at a particular time for specific reasons.  All his writings explored the causes, histories and outcomes of the world wars, but he also wrote about a huge variety of other themes. Unfortunately, Burk does not mention his many newspaper articles opposing the Common Market, a shared antipathy that largely explained his continuing links with Lord Beaverbrook.  She concludes that his three finest books were The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1848-1918, The Origins of the Second World War, and English History 1914-1945. Other readers will have their own favourites. I would also recommend The troublemakers: dissent over British foreign policy 1792-1939, and Professor A. J. P.

Mehrene Larudee observes that Mexico, for instance, grew 6% a year with the industrialisation and protectionist policies of 1951-81; when it joined NAFTA, the economy, jobs and wages all shrank.  Ha-joon Chang suggests that workers in multinational corporations have a far stronger bargaining position than employers make out. These firms often threaten to move, but rarely do. They have high sunk costs in physical plant, infrastructure, subcontracted production networks and services, skilled workers, local knowledge. Workers can take control of our workplaces, industries and countries. We can impose capital controls and reinvest the wealth we create in productive industry. `Globalisation', like the idea of God, is a ghost to frighten us. Eban Goodstein proves that protecting the environment does not destroy jobs, contrary to employer propaganda. Gregory DeFreitas argues against an open borders policy, while also opposing racial biases in immigration policy. He notes, \\"emigration represents a subsidy to the receiving country from the nation that trained them, as well as a loss of valuable talents to their homeland.\\"<br />Arthur McEwan sums up the book's findings: \\"The neo-liberal regime that is being imposed on the world economy by the Bretton Woods institutions, the US government and other powerful public and private actors is doing a great deal of damage. It is a regime that harms people in all sorts of ways in the name of economic growth, but it does not even do very well at providing economic growth. The reign of neo-liberalism has not come about as some inevitable historical process, but has been actively constructed by the powerful actors that gain from its establishment. Alternatives exist, and the alternatives tend to work better.\\"nstructed by the powerful actors that gain from its establishment.

The record shows that the British Government, despite private reservations, supported and encouraged President Kennedy's appallingly reckless behaviour before and during  the crisis.<br /> From the start of the Cuban Revolution, the British Government backed the US Government's attempts to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs and to overthrow its Government. Prime Minister Harold Macmillan wrote to President Eisenhower in July 1960, \\"I feel sure Castro has to be got rid of, but it is a tricky operation for you to contrive, and I only hope you will succeed.\\" After the US Embassy left Cuba, the British Embassy provided the Pentagon and the CIA with most of their information about Cuban affairs.  Throughout the crisis, Kennedy treated the British Government as a satellite, not an ally. At every turn, he at best informed Macmillan of what he had already decided. In return, Macmillan supported every US move, putting a misplaced, and unreciprocated, loyalty to the US Government above every other consideration.<br /> When Krushchev rashly sent the nuclear missiles to Cuba, Kennedy unilaterally decided to impose a blockade on Cuba. This was an undeclared act of war. Britain's Lord Chancellor, Lord Dilhorne, said bluntly, \\"the United States' conduct is not in conformity with international law.\\" Then Kennedy imposed a world-wide nuclear alert on US forces without consulting his NATO allies, in breach of Article 4 of the NATO Treaty. When Krushchev weakly withdrew the missiles, without consulting Castro, Macmillan servilely applauded Kennedy.<br /> Scott concludes, \\"The central diplomatic lesson of the crisis for Britain was that the price of access in Washington was loss of political independence. Such access did not of itself guarantee influence.\\" Access without influence or independence is what a footman has! So much for the `special relationship'. Loss of sovereignty is never a price worth paying.<br />Will Podmoreh for the `special relationship'. Loss of sovereignty is never a price worth paying.<br />Will Podmore	2001-05-17

Yousef planned the 1993 bombing of New York&#8217;s World Trade Center; bin Laden is wanted on charges of directing the 1998 attacks on the US Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.<br /> Their activities stem from the Reagan Government&#8217;s war against independent Afghanistan in the 1980s. Reagan gave the mujehadin logistical support, training and weapons. Between 1986 and 1989, the US and Saudi Governments gave them [millions]. The British and US Governments allowed them to open recruiting offices, under the name Al Kifah, in London and New York. Thatcher ordered the SAS to train them to use various weapons at secret camps in the Scottish Highlands, and to sell them Stinger missiles. So Thatcher, Reagan and their allies in effect created the Taliban. Ironically, the Taliban have been giving bin Laden refuge in Afghanistan since 1996. ...<br /> Yet the terrorism of Yousef and bin Laden hurts far fewer people than the US state&#8217;s policy of imposing sanctions against many countries, including Cuba and Iraq. This wholesale terrorism helps to explain, though not to justify, the retail terrorism of Yousef and bin Laden. We should oppose terrorism of whatever variety.	2001-05-17

Creating a single European state was the EC's aim from its beginning. Ross observes that \\"In contrast to ordinary international organisations, the European Community was set up to contain a supranational `motor' which would constantly press forward towards more integration.\\"<br />Deception about this aim was also built in from the very beginning. Pascal Lamy, Delors' chef de cabinet, explained, \\"The people weren't ready to agree to integration, so you had to get on without telling them too much about what was happening.\\" Ross sums it up very well: \\"the `Monnet method' politically had a `stealth' side to it. The Community's founders had never been confident that the response would be positive if Europeans were asked clearly whether they wanted European integration. From its origins EC Europe was an elite operation.\\"<br />Delors (like Blair now) did everything possible to `bring capital on board' for his schemes. The result was to exclude and alienate the working class. In this, as in all else, the European Union is classic social democracy: reformist in words, reactionary in practice. Delors' aim of building a new Europe defeated itself, given that his method was to work with capital and its existing structures.<br />Now people are increasingly wised up to the economic and political costs of political union. People now know that EU decisions affect them. This causes problems for the EU and creates opportunities for our class to oppose it. Every move by the EU generates greater resistance. For instance, in 1986 Thatcher signed the Single European Act, which carried a commitment to \\"enhance the Community's monetary capacity with a view to economic and monetary union.\\" This Single Market, that was sold to us as a great creator of jobs and production, destroyed jobs on a huge scale.<br />The Exchange Rate Mechanism was also supposed to enable productive investment to create jobs. Instead it has brought higher unemployment, which is now well over 10% across the EU. The EU's social programmes mask another 5% more unemployed. In return for losing jobs, Delors gave the trade unions  `social dialogue'. The Single Market, the Exchange Rate Mechanism and the convergence criteria laid down in the Maastricht Treaty, together caused the current recession. This in turn slowed the EU's momentum towards integration.<br />Delors had aimed to find \\"proposals that played enough to British neo-liberalism to lower the British guard against `the further pooling' of sovereignty down the line.\\" These proposals were enough to seduce successive Conservative Governments into accepting huge losses of sovereignty.<br />  What Delors hoped would be a great advance for the EU, the unification of Germany, has turned into a disaster for the EU, threatening its whole future. Unification imposed vast costs on West Germany, slowing its economic growth and increasing its budget deficit to way above the Maastricht ceiling.<br />Now the EU faces a killing dilemma: widen, to include the countries of Eastern Europe, or deepen, by moving to a single currency. Ross writes that widening to include the East European countries \\"would have wiped them out economically as swiftly and surely as German reunification had wiped out East Germany.\\" It would also, as German unification did on West Germany, impose vast costs on the present EU members, especially the richer ones.<br />Deepening is also creating its own problems. The Maastricht Treaty, and the single currency, was supposed to be the great turning point from market-building to state-building. The French Prime Minister Juppe recently said, \\"The European single currency is a political issue. It is destined to be the bedrock of the European Union.\\" On present form, it looks more likely to be its gravestone.<br />The EU increasingly resembles the old Austro-Hungarian Empire, sprawling, unwieldy and bureaucratic, with Delors as its Metternich. In every member country, workers are learning the costs of losing national sovereignty, and in every country, workers are starting to assert a new nationalism, a workers' nationalism, designed to rebuild their country.<br />Now we must seize the chance to unite Britain against the European Union. We have to take responsibility for solving Britain's problems, for finding a way out of the present mess. We must rebuild Britain by working out ways of getting everybody back to work, and by planning how to improve our area of work.increasingly resembles the old Austro-Hungarian Empire, sprawling, unwieldy and bureaucratic, with Delors as its Metternich.

He shows that countries committed to manufacturing, like Japan, Sweden, Austria and Switzerland, grow far faster (and have more jobs, at higher wages, and produce more exports) than countries committed to `post-industrialism', like the USA and Britain.<br />Fingleton observes that post-industrialists have `a childlike faith in the efficacy of free markets', noting, \\"The basic error in the laissez-faire model is that it greatly overemphasizes the interests of capital over those of labor.\\"<br />He argues that we cannot rely on financial services to rebuild our economies. He points out that basing the US economy on `information industries', as post-industrialists have recommended, would cost 25 million jobs. Post-industrial services' start-up costs are low - but so are real gains. (IBM, then Microsoft, made exceptional gains only because they monopolised setting the standards for computer operating systems.) US financial trading grew thirty times over between 1970 and 1995, while American workers' real living standards actually fell in that period. Fingleton calls finance `a cuckoo in the economy's nest': even George Soros called on governments to regulate capital markets to `stop the market destroying the economy'.<br />In Britain, we need a manufacturing renaissance. We need a national strategy for becoming self-reliant in our most important manufacturing needs. First, we have to channel savings into industrial investment and into educating more people in the most advanced skills. Second, we must retain those skills and production bases that we still have, because modern manufacturing industries need large amounts of production experience and capital. We should protect our home market, to give new industries time to grow. Third, we need to be able to produce the means of production: machine tools, production machines that make hi-tech components and electronic materials, equipment for the engineering, telecommunications, textile, chemical and power-generating industries. And fourth, we need to produce the goods that people need, particularly textiles (especially polyesters and carbon fibres), pollution control equipment, shipping (the world's fleet has more than doubled since 1970), and high quality steel.telecommunications, textile, chemical and power-generating industries.

Henri Milne Edwards conducted the first expedition by a submarine biologist in 1844 off Sicily. As early as 1865, the mining engineer Benoit Rouqayrol designed a diving suit with a compressed air cylinder at the back, and a demand valve that supplied oxygen only when the diver sucked on the mouthpiece; but the idea somehow lay forgotten for eighty years.<br />The engineer Otis Barton designed, built and tested the first bathysphere in 1932, reaching a depth of 3000 feet. Jack Kitching was the first marine ecologist. In the 1930s, Guy Gilpatric, who held a world altitude record when he was only sixteen, invented the very idea of diving for pleasure.<br />John Scott Haldane worked on improving miners' safety and studied the effects of high pressure on deep-sea divers and of altitude sickness in climbers. His son, the communist and geneticist J.B.S. Haldane, was the first to map the genes on a human chromosome. He also worked on solving the problems of pressure experienced by divers and submariners.<br />In 1942, Jacques Cousteau's colleague Emile Gagnan re-invented the demand valve, the key to developing the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA). Louis Boutan and Ernest Williamson started underwater photography, popularised by those most photogenic photographers, Hans and Lotte Haas, in their 26 BBC television programmes.<br />Frederic Dumas, Peter Throckmorton and George Bass initiated underwater archaeology. Throckmorton found lost ships all over the world, most famously a 3,200-year-old wreck at Bodrum on the Aegean coast. He was the first to realise that \\"it was possible to do scientific archaeology under water.\\" He acutely observed, \\"What historians had missed, the sea remembered.\\"<br />Trevor Norton's fascinating book is full of humorous stories and conveys masses of information in a charming and easy style.	2001-05-17

Government ministers say that they have been defending the pound, but this always seems to have been at the expense of the real economy. It has of course amounted to nothing but a savage attack on the working class.<br />Stephens sensibly relates the politics of the pound to events in the European Union. He reminds us that in 1978, the Callaghan Government had the sense to reject entering the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. Callaghan rightly warned that the ERM \\"would place obligations on us that might result in unnecessary deflation and unemployment.\\" Manfred Lahnstein, head of the West German finance ministry, had tactlessly revealed that his Government expected the ERM to cap the Deutschmark's value against other member currencies, giving Germany a sustained competitive edge.<br />In 1979-81, Thatcher used high interest rates to force up the pound's value by 30 per cent. This caused the biggest deflationary shock since 1925, when the Conservatives returned to gold at a ludicrously overvalued price. The next worst shock was Major's 1990-92 slump. Between them, these two recent Conservative slumps cost us about £200 billion in lost output.<br />When Major forced Britain into the ERM, only twelve Conservative MPs voted against. The Labour opposition followed the Government. The Government went in to the wrong thing, at the wrong time, at the wrong rate, and for the wrong reasons. Apart from that, it was a brilliant decision. The rigidity of a single system imposed crushing deflation. As Stephens writes, \\"Holding sterling to a Deutschmark parity which had been established in entirely different circumstances closed off the option of lower interest rates.\\"<br />The high interest rates imposed by the ERM made our manufacturing output fall by five per cent in nine months. Excluding North Sea oil, our national output fell for twenty-one successive months. The housing market collapsed, leaving hundreds of thousands of people trapped in negative equity; consumers were forced into unprecedented levels of debt.<br />  After this abrasive experience of a trial monetary union, what did the Government decide to do? It spent most of 1992 forcing the Maastricht Treaty on Economic and Monetary Union through Parliament. Major said, \\"The ratification and implementation of the Treaty is in our national interest.\\"<br />But Monetary Union would have disastrous consequences for jobs, incomes and growth. As Stephens warns, \\"A single currency, however, cannot be used as an instrument to force convergence among disparate economies.\\"xcluding North Sea oil, our national output fell for twenty-one successive months.

He brilliantly demolishes the political and economic cases for Britain's joining the euro, and exposes the single currency's key role as the motor of EU state building. He sums up: \\"the economic case for the single currency is feeble and unconvincing, the political and constitutional consequences of EMU and the euro are utterly unacceptable.\\"<br />He notes that the Labour Government's entire economic policy obeys Decisions by the European Council of Ministers. He also refutes the case for a single EU foreign and defence policy and for a single European Army.<br />He points out the problems of enlarging the EU. Its commitment to the free movement of labour, if extended to the twelve proposed new members, would result in vast immigration flows into the present EU members. Extending the Common Agricultural Policy to Eastern Europe would probably bankrupt the entire EU. So the price of enlargement could be a two-tier EU.<br />He warns that many will undemocratically interfere in any future referendum on euro entry, as the CIA did in the 1975 Referendum, and as President Mitterand interfered in German and Italian elections, illegally funding Kohl and Craxi. Also, the European Court of Justice says that European companies trading with Britain are not foreign, allowing them to promote the euro.<br />What should Britain do? Lord Shore argues against integration, and makes good arguments for leaving the EU: if we left, the EU's external tariff against our goods would be only 3-4%, and that we could again buy cheaper better food from the rest of the world. He argues that being in the second tier of a two-tier Europe would suit us. However, this would not be in our interests; we would still be constantly pressed to join the first tier. We would still be subordinate to the EU's unelected and supranational institutions, with their built-in, growing democratic deficit. We should stay out of the single currency, and then go on to leave the EU.t-in, growing democratic deficit. We should stay out of the single currency, and then go on to leave the EU.	2001-05-17

As she noted of EMU, \\"This transfer of national sovereignty can arguably be considered to be one of the most far-reaching formal transfers of sovereignty to the European level that the European Community (EC) members have witnessed to date.\\" She studied the ways that central bankers, Ministries of Finance, employers' organisations and trade union leaderships in Britain, France and Germany all perceived EMU.  The bankers, Ministries and employers' organisations agreed that EMU would strengthen the market mechanism in Europe. They also agreed that it would assist their efforts to create a single European state. As Verdun observed, \\"EMU will eventually necessitate more integration of economic, fiscal, social and labour policies.\\"  Some quarters of the TUC hoped that associating themselves with the EU's decision-making process would increase their power. But the more the TUC claimed to set the EU agenda on social and employment issues, the more it linked itself to the EU's disastrous impact on Britain's industry and welfare.  Some trade union leaders thought that the EU would restore the influence over economic policy-making that they had lost at national level. But cosying up to the employer, whether European or British, weakens our unions, not strengthens us.  Some thought that possible gains from the Social Charter would justify the certain losses from labour market flexibility. But who talks about the Social Charter today? Did it save any of the 96,000 manufacturing jobs destroyed in Britain last year?  So why was there so little public discussion of EMU's costs and benefits? Verdun does not finally explain, but one suspects that it was because its benefits would accrue only to the ruling classes of Britain, France and Germany, while the public, the vast majority of us who have to work for a living, would suffer all the costs.osts.	2001-05-17

Jean Monnet wrote, \\"Everyday realities will make it possible to form the political union which is the goal of our Community and to establish the United States of Europe.\\" Konrad Adenauer said that the original proposal for pooling French and German steel production was \\"first and foremost political, not economic. This plan was to be the beginning of a federal structure of Europe.\\"<br />Later, Chancellor Kohl said, \\"In Maastricht we laid the foundation stone for the completion of the European Union. The European Union Treaty introduces a new and decisive stage in the process of European Union which within a few years will lead to the creation of what the founding fathers of modern Europe dreamed after the last war: the United States of Europe.\\"<br />In practice, the EU has already gone far towards creating a new state, although it has signally failed to create one that is honest and democratic. As Shore writes, \\"To most critical observers it seems quite evident that the European Community has acquired most of the characteristics of a state, however much some might wish to deny this.\\" And, \\"with its single currency, its Central Bank and treaty control over money supply and borrowing, the EU takes on the powers of a sovereign state, albeit a transnational state without a democratic government.\\" As Pascal Lamy, Delors' chef de cabinet, admitted, \\"The people weren't ready to agree to integration, so you had to get on without telling them too much about what was happening.\\"<br />The Committee of Independent Experts reported in 1999 that fraud, cronyism, mismanagement and cover-ups were rife in the European Commission, summarising, \\"It is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility.\\" Shore concludes that the Report \\"exposed ... the extraordinary degree to which patronage, fraud and corruption ... had become established, even institutionalised, within the Commission.\\"hore concludes that the Report \\"exposed ... the extraordinary degree to which patronage, fraud and corruption ... had become established, even institutionalised, within the Commission.\\"	2001-05-17

Nine economists evaluate the economic and policy implications of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Three somewhat atypical representatives of business - Stephen Davies of the Institute of Directors, and the Lords Haskins and Simon - discuss its likely effect on British firms. Couldn't they find anybody from manufacturing industry?<br />Unfortunately, the editors include only two trade unionists, both of whom support EMU. Why didn't they find someone to speak for the majority of trade union members who oppose it? Finally, four MPs discuss its effect upon national sovereignty.<br />The contribution by John Edmonds, the GMB's General Secretary, is most revealing. He argues for conditionally supporting EMU. Yet he admits, \\"The tendency in any negotiations is for conditions to be successively stripped away until all that remains is a stark position of support covered by a few words of threadbare rhetoric.\\" Quite!<br />The editors write that entering EMU \\"is intended to be a one-way shift towards future economic integration.\\" But that is not all that EMU means: Edmonds openly says that he wants to `achieve extensive political union'. That is why he supports our entry into the euro: the euro was, until recently, the key motor for driving us all into the single European state that the EU's leaders all want.<br />Blair has now had to accept that he cannot presently win a referendum on the euro. However, this does not mean that he will respect our wishes in future. The EU's leaders can advance on many different fronts and employ many different devices to form a single European state: the Euro-army, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Corpus Juris, a single taxation policy, etc.<br />The majority of the British people do not want to enter the euro.

He is passionately committed to the European Union, but his book presents much information very useful to those who oppose it.<br />He recounts that in the 1971-72 Parliamentary debates, \\"Ministers did not lie, but they avoided telling the full truth. They refrained from stating categorically that the law of the European Community would have supremacy over British law.\\" \\"Nor did ministers state that the European Communities Act would be, in practice, irrevocable.\\" \\"Enthusiasts for entry, as we have seen in the cases of Edward Heath and Geoffrey Howe, felt it prudent to mask the radical nature of the transaction they were proposing.\\" He cites Howe's admission that the Government concealed much from Parliament. And he recalls that a Government lawyer said, \\"Open admission of what was being done to parliamentary sovereignty would be `so astounding' as to put the whole Bill in danger.\\"<br />  None repeated the clarity of Foreign Secretary Lord Home when he told the Lords in August 1961: \\"let me admit at once that the Treaty of Rome would involve considerable derogation of sovereignty.\\" Its consequences would, he said, be \\"different in kind from any contract into which we have entered before.\\"<br />EU supporters said that EC entry would bring economic growth. When it didn't, they said the Single Market would. When it didn't, they said the Exchange Rate Mechanism would - Young remarks, with considerable under-statement, \\"The story of the ERM was not an entirely happy one.\\" When that failed, bringing the worst slump for sixty years, they said that the euro would bring growth.<br />He presents the real issue: \\"The serious case, surely, is ... about national control over big decisions. The EU renders collective a decision-making process, in some areas, that was once exclusively national.\\" Entering the euro would end our national democratic control over policy: is this what we want?icy: is this what we want?	2001-05-17

We will have to base it on manufacturing industry, and we can only achieve it outside the euro.<br /> The closer the EC members have got to economic and monetary union (EMU), the slower their economies have grown. From 1950 to 1969, when the original six members had no form of EMU, their average growth per annum was 5.5%. When they linked their currencies in the `snake', from 1969 to 1975, it was 3.7%, falling from 6.9% to minus 1.2%. From 1976 to 1979, it was 3.6%. When they again linked their currencies through the Exchange Rate Mechanism, from 1979 to 1993, it was 2.1%, falling from 4.7% to minus 1%. Unemployment remorselessly increased. So both the snake and the ERM gradually squeezed the life out of the EC's economies!<br /> The Treaty establishing EMU put price stability first, above full employment, high growth or better living standards. This is Thatcher's monetarist fallacy, that the battle against inflation is the overriding economic aim, because low or zero inflation will produce higher growth. John Mills showed that in practice low inflation is not the cause of high growth but the effect of low growth, and conversely, that high inflation is not the cause of low growth but the effect of high growth.<br /> Mills shows that `supply-side' reforms increasing productivity do not in themselves increase competitiveness. In fact, when a currency is overpriced, reducing its value increases competitiveness, and thereby increases productivity. Our continually overvalued pound increases companies' costs, and therefore export prices, pricing their goods out of the market. For instance, Britain's export prices rose by 380% between 1952 and 1979, while Japan's rose by only 33%.<br /> Most importantly, he proves that manufacturing is crucial to productivity growth, because increases in productivity are relatively easy to achieve in manufacturing industry. As initial fixed expenses become spread over longer production runs, costs per unit fall.

Throughout history, the main cause of death has been the contamination of drinking water by sewage. In particular, cholera spread when the faeces of sufferers contaminated drinking water: cholera epidemics in London killed 6,536 people in 1831-32, 14,137 in 1848-49, and 10,738 in 1853-54.<br /> In the long hot summer of 1858, the stench from rotting sewage in the Thames drove MPs from Westminster. The `Great Stink' forced them, belatedly, to act. Bazalgette was charged with building a system to prevent sewage getting into Londoners' drinking water, which he did. The 1866 cholera epidemic killed 5,596 people in the East End, the sole part of London that had not yet been protected by Bazalgette's intercepting system. After the system was completed, cholera would never again kill Londoners. Bazalgette had turned the Thames from the filthiest to the cleanest metropolitan river in the world and added some twenty years to Londoners' lives.<br /> But this was not Bazalgette's only success. He constructed the Victoria, Albert and Chelsea Embankments, where he introduced the use of Portland cement. He laid out Shaftesbury Avenue, Northumberland Avenue, Charing Cross Road, the Embankment Gardens, Battersea Park and Clapham Common. He built the bridges at Hammersmith, Putney and Battersea. He introduced the Woolwich Free Ferry and designed the Blackwall Tunnel.<br /> In 1889, the London County Council replaced the Board: Bazalgette's successes had proven the value of local government for great cities. Roy Porter wrote that Bazalgette stands with Wren and Nash `as one of London's noblest builders'. John Doxat wrote, \\"this superb and farsighted engineer probably did more good, and saved more lives, than any single Victorian public official.\\"than any single Victorian public official.\\"	2001-05-17

This book tells the story of Sir Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914-16. Lansing wrote the original manuscript in 1959, based on the diaries and recollections of the expedition's members. He tells this gripping story in a spare prose that only adds to the story's terrific suspense.<br />Shackleton's aim was to compensate the Empire for the American Robert Peary's being the first to reach the North Pole in 1909 and for the Norwegian Roald Amundsen's beating Robert Scott to the South Pole in 1912. With 27 men, Shackleton set sail in the Endurance from Buenos Aires in October 1914, seeking to make the first overland crossing of the Antarctic - an ambition not achieved until 1958.<br />They left the island of South Georgia in December, but in January the Endurance became trapped in pack ice in the Weddell Sea, and stayed trapped for nine months until she sank in November. They were 1200 miles from the nearest human beings. They had no radio transmitter and no hope of rescue. The crew now struggled North for six months, travelling 400 miles, walking and dragging their three boats, drifting on fragile ice floes.<br />They launched the boats after the pack ice finally released them, and made a six-day voyage to Elephant Island, where Shackleton left 22 men camped. Then he and five crewmembers sailed 850 miles back to South Georgia - sixteen days, in an open twenty-foot boat, across the stormiest ocean in the world. Shackleton and two others then trekked across the mountains and glaciers of South Georgia, a crossing next made in far easier conditions in 1955.<br />The tale shows how all the men discussed what they had to do next and how, once they took a decision, they implemented it. It also shows Shackleton's extraordinary powers of decision and judgment. Despite their appalling ordeals, they didn't lose a man. No wonder that Chris Bonington called it `the greatest survival story of all time'.	2001-05-17

For fifteen years, he has been constantly engaged with Coleridge's ideas, poems, plays and philosophical writings. He traces Coleridge's lifelong dialogues with the greatest of English poets, Shakespeare, Milton and Wordsworth, and also with the finest German writers, Goethe and Schiller.<br />Coleridge was that rare creature, a superb poet who could also grapple with the deepest of philosophers. He could brilliantly summarise the two basic possible lines in philosophy: \\"The difference between Aristotle and Plato is that which will remain as long as we are men and there is any difference between man and man in point of opinion. Plato, with Pythagoras before him, had conceived that the phenomenon or outside appearance, all that we call thing or matter, is but as it were a language by which the invisible (that which is not the object of our senses) communicates its existence to our finite beings ... Aristotle, on the contrary, affirmed that all our knowledge had begun in experience, had begun through the senses, and that from the senses only we could take our notions of reality ... It was the first way in which, plainly and distinctly, two opposite systems were placed before the mind of the world.\\"<br />Although Coleridge adhered to Platonism, he honestly admitted, \\"All these poetico-philosophical Arguments strike and shatter themselves into froth against that stubborn rock, the fact of Consciousness, or rather its dependence on the body.\\"<br />Like other notable literary biographies - one thinks of Holmes' earlier one of Shelley, Richard Ellman's of Oscar Wilde, Peter Ackroyd's of Charles Dickens, Tim Hilton's of John Ruskin, E. P. Thompson's of William Morris, and Leon Edel's of Henry James - this wonderful book arouses our enthusiasm for literature. It shows us again how a great writer's work can help us both to enjoy and to make sense of the world.	2001-05-17

Among many other matters, it analyses Major's abortive `beef war', the Common Agricultural Policy fiasco, the Common Fisheries Policy disaster, what the authors call `The single market: the great illusion', VAT (the EU tax), the single currency, the European Court of Justice's role, and the systematic deception practised by the EU and its supporters.<br />The key to understanding the EU is to see that it is an attack on our political independence. All the rest follows from this; if we lose sovereignty, we suffer ever-growing economic damage, agricultural disaster (`set aside', burning crops, grubbing up apple trees), ever-increasing and ever-widening VAT, the destruction of our fishing fleet and of our fish stocks, and the many appalling abuses, absurdities, frauds and extravagances that the authors chronicle.<br />On the drive towards a single European state, they write that, \\"For the French, the Germans, the Commission and other countries, the move to economic and monetary union agreed at Maastricht was the central thrust of their drive towards the complete integration of the Community into a single state, of which the further additions planned at the IGC, such as a common foreign and defence policy, were only corollaries which must logically follow. Mr Major's refusal to discuss the Single Currency issue had been a crucial part of his strategy to divert British attention from what was really going on in the rest of Europe.\\" They say that the present Government \\"no more spoke and acted on behalf of the interests and wishes of their fellow-countrymen than the Vichy government had acted for the people of wartime France.\\"<br />During the 1992 election campaign, the Conservative, Labour and Liberal Parties (and, for that matter, the SNP and Plaid Cymru) barely mentioned the Maastricht Treaty. The Treaty aimed to end our economic and monetary sovereignty by imposing Economic and Monetary Union. Monetary Union means a single currency, to be called the euro; Economic Union means a single economic policy, a single taxation and spending policy, which we already know as monetarism. The authors sum up: \\"In short, the coming of full `Economic and Monetary Union' would mean the most complete surrender of sovereignty any country could contemplate, short of being physically occupied by an enemy power.\\"<br />This book tells us a lot about the way our political leaders have cheated and lied in their efforts to destroy our independence. In 1990, Heath was asked if had in mind `a United States of Europe' when he took us in to the Common Market: he replied, `Of course, yes.' That is not what he said at the time!<br />In 1992, Honourable members and noble Lords solemnly debated and voted for a Treaty that they had not even seen. The Government had not yet published the Maastricht Treaty, and neither Commons nor Lords insisted on seeing it before voting for it. Douglas Hurd even said that he had not read it before signing it!<br /><br />ECONOMIC EFFECTS<br />What of the EU's much-vaunted economic benefits? Surely, such far-reaching sacrifices of sovereignty could only be justified by some pretty hefty gains? In 1971, Heath said that joining the Common Market would have `positive and substantial' effects on our balance of payments. What really happened? From 1973 to 1995, our accumulated trade deficit with EU was £100 billion; we had a trade surplus with every other continent: our accumulated trade surplus with the rest of the world came to £80 billion.<br />The European Exchange Rate Mechanism, EMU's forerunner, cost us at least £70 billion in lost output and jobs during the two years that we were in it. On 10 September 1992, six days before Britain left it, Major declared that  \\"the soft option, the devaluer's option, the inflationary option would be a betrayal of our future, and it is not the Government's policy.\\" The Government, the Opposition and the country's leading institutions all agreed that devaluation would be a disaster, and that the ERM was inevitable and wonderful. The subsequent devaluation has led to the lowest level of inflation for 40 years. And this miserable Government tries now to take the credit for the consequences of our leaving ERM!<br />The EU has some very large tax rises waiting for us. In 1977, the 6th VAT Directive obliged all member states to harmonise their VAT systems by 1997: Jacques Santer recently said that this was `a priority'. This would mean 17.5% rates of VAT on our domestic heating, children's clothing and shoes, books and newspapers, tickets for rail, air and bus, new houses, and food. VAT on food would add £7 billion a year to Britain's shopping bills. Our exemption on food is being reviewed this year. The Maastricht Treaty says that all states must accept the fully-harmonised VAT system, with no more derogations (that means us!)<br />Our total budgetary contributions to the EU since we joined are £100 billion. In 1995, we contributed £7.7 billion to the EU (£132 per person) and received back just £4 billion in grants and subsidies. The contributions come from the working class; the grants and subsidies go to companies, landowners and big farmers.<br />The EU's effect on our capacity to grow good cheap food has been disastrous. The CAP adds £1000 to the average family's food bill every year. In 1995 alone, the EU spent £439 million on destroying food. The CAP gave 13 companies and landowners £500,000 each; 5000 big farmers got £50,000 each. That is a total of £256.5 million in subsidies just to these 5013. 80% of subsidies go to 20% of farmers. Between 1990 and 1994, over 300 abattoirs were closed down, destroying jobs and causing needless suffering to animals which had to be transported ever further for slaughter.<br />A report from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in 1995 detailed the CAP's failings but concluded \\"most other EU governments appear strongly attached to the CAP in its present form.\\" So it is impossible to reform the CAP, although all Parliamentary parties endlessly pledge their intent to do so. The only way to improve our situation is to leave the CAP.<br />EU FRAUD<br />Clearly, the EU has an uphill job trying to persuade us that losing our sovereignty gives us more power and that economic destruction brings progress. So it resorts to systematic deception to try to make us accept their theft of our sovereignty.<br />For example, in 1994 the CBI surveyed what its member firms thought of a single currency. It sent a questionnaire to 624 selected firms; 206 replied. Only 59 firms, just 28% of those replying, favoured joining a single currency. 115 firms, 56%, said a single currency might help their business in the long run but `was not a necessity'. 181 firms, 88%, opposed any `deepening integration' of the EU.<br />Government and CBI spokesmen added the 28% and the 56% together to claim that a majority of CBI members favoured EMU. So the Government and CBI leaders creatively defined 59 firms, 0.7 % of the CBI's 8,000 members, as the majority!<br />For a more realistic picture, it is necessary only to notice that in 1995 the Federation of Small Businesses (membership 70,000) voted to leave the EU, and that in 1996 2000 members of  the Institute of Directors at their annual conference voted overwhelmingly against joining a single currency.<br />The authors give another example of the kind of sharp practice that the EU uses. In 1994, a body calling itself the `Higher Education European Social Fund Services' sent letters to British universities saying: \\"The receipt of future ESF support .. [would be] .. Influenced by the amount of publicity given to ESF projects.\\" No wonder that corruption and fraud are on the increase!<br />In all, we should congratulate the authors for their unremitting assault on the European Union and all its works.

In 1978, Chancellor Schmidt suggested a European Monetary System whose members would share responsibility: this drew in the leaders of the other EU states. But the German Government then changed the EMS's rules so it was created in March 1979 as a Deutschmark zone.<br />The Bundesbank dominated the EMS, forcing deflation on its members. They suffered substantial slowdowns in growth and increased unemployment in the 1980s, and levels of investment declined compared to the rest of the industrialised world. Trade between EMS members actually fell, and their inflation rates declined no more than those of non-members. As the Federation of German Trade Unions said, \\"We have criticised the Bundesbank because it always cares more about monetary stability than general economic policy. We put employment first\\"; the Bank was \\"strangling growth in Germany and Europe\\".<br />  In 1987, the French Government proposed a Franco-German Economic and Financial Council to coordinate economic and monetary policies. Chancellor Kohl at first agreed, but the Bundesbank refused to share power. So Kohl then stripped the proposed Council of any policy-making powers, preserving the Bundesbank's dominance.<br />In 1988, the French Government put forward a scheme for Economic and Monetary Union. Kohl at first rejected it, in order to win the 1990 election, then embraced it after the election. The scheme's European Central Bank, unaccountable and unelected, was modelled on the Bundesbank, except that it is not obliged to support Government policy. Its only aim is price stability. The President of the ECB promised that \\"policy will be directed towards the French and German economies ... smaller fry with other needs come second ...\\"  But even in the EMS's dominant economy, unemployment is five million.<br />By entering EMU, we would hand over control of our economy, irrevocably, to a replica of the Bundesbank, in which our needs would be subordinate.

In this book, described by one reviewer as `the best book ever written on the human mind', he puts forward a general theory about how and why the human mind works the way it does. Yet it is not a ponderous book; it is beautifully written and full of jokes and stories.<br />Pinker marries Darwin's theory of evolution to the latest developments in neuroscience and computation. He shows in detail how the process of natural selection shaped our entire neurological networks; how the struggle for survival selects from among our genes those most fit to flourish in our environment. Nature has produced in us bodies, brains and minds attuned to coping intelligently with whatever our environment demands. Housed in our bodies, our minds structure neural networks into adaptive programmes for handling our perceptions. Pinker concludes, \\"The mind is a system of organs of computation, designed by natural selection to solve the kinds of problems our ancestors faced in their foraging way of life.\\"<br />Our beliefs and desires are information, allowing us to create meaning. \\"Beliefs are inscriptions in memory, desires are goal inscriptions, thinking is computation, perceptions are inscriptions triggered by sensors, trying is executing operations triggered by a goal.\\" Pinker writes that the mind has a `design stance' for dealing with artefacts, a `physical stance' for dealing with objects, and an `intentional stance' for dealing with people. \\"Causal and inferential roles tend to be in sync because natural selection designed both our perceptual and our inferential modules to work accurately, most of the time, in this world.\\" With this down-to-earth kind of explanation, there is no need to invoke mysterious intangible powers: \\"We don't need spirits or occult forces to explain intelligence.\\"  Pinker sums up the recent amazing developments in neurobiology and cognitive science. This book, like those by his colleagues Daniel Dennett (`Darwin's dangerous idea' and `Consciousness explained') and Richard Dawkins (`River out of Eden' and `Unweaving the rainbow'), should be required reading. They are all Darwinians, but then why shouldn't they be? It is just like saying that all physicists are Einsteinians nowadays, or that all poets and playwrights are Shakespeareans, or that all osteopaths are Stillians. Their books make Karl Popper, so hostile to Darwin, and Californian gurus like Fritjof Capra, sadly outdated.<br />Good science, like Darwinism generally, in no way undermines osteopathy. In fact, by giving coherent, intelligible accounts of the ways in which our bodies and minds have evolved, writers like Pinker can help us to understand better how and why our bodies work in the ways they do.pirits or occult forces to explain intelligence.\\"   Pinker sums up the recent amazing developments in neurobiology and cognitive science.

These are matters that demand clear thinking, not knee-jerk reactions.<br />He raises the difficult questions about national sovereignty. Would entering the euro threaten our national independence? Would it be like choosing to enter a terminable contract, or would it mean giving up forever the freedom to take such decisions in the future? Is membership of the European Union compatible with national sovereignty? Does the British working class have the power and the right, if it chooses, to make the Government oppose British entry into the euro? (We have already made Blair back off from publicly supporting it, so perhaps we have!)<br />He asks awkward questions about the very identity of our nation. Is Britain one nation, or is it three, or even four? Are Scotland and Wales separate nations, and so entitled to secede? (It can be argued that the English, Scottish and Welsh people have been successfully united for centuries and are no threat to each other, so there is no basis for secession.) Is Ulster part of Britain or of Ireland? (Certainly, every poll on the subject shows that few of us think of Ulster as part of Britain.)<br />Finally, he asks awkward questions about immigration and asylum. Should a nation control its own borders? Indeed, should there be any border controls at all? By European Union rules, capital and labour must be allowed to move freely, with workers shifted across borders as capital dictates. Should we allow the EU to decide these matters for us?	2001-05-17

In this excellent little book, he analyses the prospects for Economic and Monetary Union.<br />Firstly, he shows the difficulties that countries are having when their governments try to meet the criteria for Economic and Monetary Union. He points out that in 1994 none of the twelve European Community countries met all four criteria; Italy and Portugal met none of them. Six countries failed the inflation test; two had interest rates too high; ten had fiscal deficits too high, and eight had excessive public debts.<br />  Since then, European Union economies have stagnated or shrunk, so they are even further from meeting the criteria. Four of the six countries with debt ratios above 75 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1993 ran bigger budget deficits in 1994 than in 1992, so they would have to make even bigger cuts in their deficits before they can start to cut their debt ratios.<br />The Governments are in a dilemma: they cannot cut their budget deficits quickly to the stipulated three per cent without depressing real economic activity. And the more they deflate their economies, the less popular support there is for Economic and Monetary Union. Professor Kenen sums up, \\"It is thus unlikely that a majority of EC countries will be ready for Stage Three in 1997, when a majority is required to set a starting date, and it may be hard to muster a majority in 1999 - although a majority is not needed then.\\"  Stage Three is supposed to start automatically in 1999!<br />Secondly, Kenen studies the likely results if Governments seriously try to meet the criteria. He cites Buiter et al, writing in Economic Policy: \\"Greece, Italy, Belgium and Ireland need serious fiscal retrenchment, but getting even halfway to the Maastricht debt targets ... involves dangerous fiscal overkill. A blatantly unrealistic debt target is unhelpful for these countries in designing effective fiscal programs.\\" They write that the necessary scale of retrenchment would involve \\"the economics of the lunatic asylum.\\"<br />  Kenen also cites the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels, which says that \\"If the Maastricht targets are adhered to, something significant will have to give in terms of public expenditure in many EC countries, with social consequences which could be highly disruptive. Clawing back public deficits which are across the Community higher in GDP percentage terms than they have been at any moment since the EC was founded, at a time when more and more 'legitimate' demands are made on the public purse, looks increasingly like trying to run up a downward moving escalator.\\"<br />Thirdly, Kenen looks at the costs of joining Economic and Monetary Union. He cites the economists Ghosh and Wolf who estimate that joining it would cost as much as 2.5 per cent of the European Union's total GDP. The European Union's own employment committee said that Economic and Monetary Union would destroy ten million jobs in the European Union.<br />  Supporters of Economic and Monetary Union like to claim that it would curb the speculators, tame finance capital, and end financial crises. But what does Kenen conclude? \\"In the first years of Economic and Monetary Union, then, the G-7 countries may find it harder to agree on policies and strategies for exchange rate management, and Economic and Monetary Union may thus lead to exchange rate fluctuations wider than those seen since the Louvre Accord [of 1987]. That would be truly ironic. Economic and Monetary Union is meant to replace the EMS (European Monetary System), which emerged from the desire to create a zone of monetary stability in Europe. Yet the achievement of that goal may have the effect of producing greater exchange rate instability at the global level.\\"<br />A single European currency would not end speculation. It would still be operating in the world of global speculative flows. A single currency would be the focus forspeculation against the dollar and the yen, and a smaller number of currencies could generate even more rapid and destabilising speculative flows.<br />So, to sum up, Kenen's book shows us that Economic and Monetary Union would be extremely difficult and painful to achieve. It would mean savage cuts in public spending (an estimated £18 billion in Britain), a 2.5 per cent reduction in GDP, and greater exchange rate instability. The cuts in public spending would also increase unemployment, reduce wages and worsen our public services...speculation against the dollar and the yen, and a smaller number of currencies could generate even more rapid and destabilising speculative flows.<br />So, to sum up, Kenen's book shows us that Economic and Monetary Union would be extremely difficult and painful to achieve.

It shows that the attempts to achieve monetary and economic union, and consequently political union, are bad for us. They will not bring monetary stability, economic growth or political harmony. Instead they will destabilise currencies, reduce growth and promote hatred between the nations of Europe.<br />Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is supposed to build on the experience of the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). Britain's membership of the ERM forced us into a disastrous and quite unnecessary recession. After two years of suffering, Major said in July 1992 that Britain would soon be the leader of the ERM. Two months later, we were well out of it, and ERM had bermbed, as Jacques Clouseau, Major's mentor, would say.<br />ERM constrained British Government policy on non-monetary matters too. The Government appeased Spain over the fishing dispute to keep Spain happy about the sterling/peseta rate. So the Common Fisheries Policy, so damaging to Britain's fishing industry, is not an isolated EU aberration: it stems from the whole logic of economic and monetary union.<br />The ERM was described as the Eternal Recession Mechanism; EMU is likely to be Even More Useless. The ERM kept the poor countries poor; it did not help them to converge; it certainly did not help them to meet the Maastricht criteria. Spain's experience of ERM was catastrophic: 22% unemployed. The ERM forced Denmark into recession: unemployment doubled to 12%, the budget was slashed, and investment, output and wages all fell. In the ERM, Ireland's unemployment soared from 11% to 23%. ERM subordinated nations' economic interests to minorities' foreign policy goals: ruling class interests dominated working class interests. Some still claim that ERM and EMU could control capital, but actually they were and are attacks on the working class.<br />A 1992 report by the Monetary Committee, which advises the EU's Council of Ministers, admitted that ERM did not stabilise prices or money and did not reduce inflation. Perhaps it was after all just a tool for moving countries towards political union.<br />  The book also depicts the present dangerous struggle between the French and German ruling classes for control over the proposed institutions of a single European state. Germany is determined to keep the Deutschmark and the Bundesbank: it wants EMU so that it can assimilate other countries into an expanded Deutschmark zone. France wants a new currency and wants to get its hands on the Bundesbank; it pushed for the Maastricht Treaty, which would destroy the Deutschmark. Who would control Europe's currency? Who would control the proposed new European Central Bank? Germany or France?<br />As Wilhelm Nolling, a Bundesbank Council member, said: &quot;We should be under no illusion - the present controversy over the new European monetary order is about power, influence and the pursuit of national interests.&quot;<br />They are already fighting about the 1996 InterGovernmental Conference. Germany wants the economic criteria for EMU met as soon as possible: it insists that economic convergence must precede monetary union. France wants the earliest possible date for monetary union, believing that monetary union would produce economic convergence. Both are wrong of course: convergence cannot and will not be achieved, either way.<br />EMU's implications are universally unpopular. The workers of France, Italy and Belgium are striking against the EU's schemes. The Austrian Government fell in October, unable to pass the EU-required budget.<br />We can see both from ERM's effects, and from the effects of the attempted imposition of the Maastricht criteria, how damaging membership of EMU would be. It would cause, as intended, a permanent lowering of wages, a permanently higher level of unemployment, and massive cuts in public spending.<br />Connolly sums up: &quot;My central thesis is that the ERM and EMU are not only inefficient but also undemocratic: a danger not only to our wealth but to our freedoms and ultimately, our peace. The villains of the story - some more culpable than others - are bureaucrats and self-aggrandizing politicians. The ERM is a mechanism for subordinating the economic welfare, democratic rights and national freedom of citizens of the European countries to the will of political and bureaucratic elites whose power-lust, cynicism and delusions underlie the actions of the vast majority of those who now strive to create a European superstate. The ERM has been their chosen instrument, and they have used it cleverly.&quot;ermanently higher level of unemployment, and massive cuts in public spending.<br />Connolly sums up: &quot;My central thesis is that the ERM and EMU are not only inefficient but also undemocratic: a danger not only to our wealth but to our freedoms and ultimately, our peace.

MacDonald writes, \\"Cuba has, since its revolution in 1959, actually delivered the goods as far as social policy is concerned. In this regard they have been spectacularly successful and astonishingly innovative in the  two critically important public policy areas of education and  health.\\"<br />Cuba achieves the world's highest 5-year child survival rate for  a given GNP. It delivers primary and preventive heath care to all citizens.  They have ended polio, malaria, diphtheria, measles, whooping cough,  typhoid and tuberculosis. (Compare the USA: in 1991, 25,000 people caught  measles, and 60 died.) They have done all this despite the US state's  forty-year blockade.<br />President Bush admitted that the blockade was to  force Cuba to change its government to suit the US government. The 1992 Act  tightening the blockade stopped $718 millions worth of business, 90% of  which was in food and medicine. It bans the sale of medicines, fertilisers,  pesticides, animal feed, water treatment chemicals, and components for  water treatment plants.<br />The US Government claims that it provides  licences for selling medicines and medical equipment. But no US parent  company has got a licence for direct sales to Cuba. Only four subsidiaries  got licences between October 1992 and May 1995, after inordinate delays,  much red tape, increased costs and shipping difficulties. A Department of  Commerce official wrote to a Canadian subsidiary seeking a licence to sell  X-ray machine parts (refused), \\"It is the policy of the United States not  to approve license applications to Cuba.\\"<br /> In 1997, the American  Association for World Health, a US committee that serves the WHO, issued a  300-page report on the blockade's impact, entitled `Denial of food and  medicine'.... After a yearlong investigation, it  concluded that the blockade has dramatically harmed the health and  nutrition of Cuban citizens, despite their Herculean efforts to maintain  their high standards of health care.<br /><br />Will Podmorerculean efforts to maintain  their high standards of health care. <br /> <br />Will Podmore	2000-06-27

In this book, described by one reviewer  as `the best book ever written on the human mind', he puts forward a  general theory about how and why the human mind works the way it does. Yet  it is not a ponderous book; it is beautifully written and full of jokes and  stories.  <br />Pinker marries Darwin's theory of evolution to the latest  developments in neuroscience and computation. He shows in detail how the  process of natural selection shaped our entire neurological networks; how  the struggle for survival selects from among our genes those most fit to  flourish in our environment. Nature has produced in us bodies, brains and  minds attuned to coping intelligently with whatever our environment  demands. Housed in our bodies, our minds structure neural networks into  adaptive programmes for handling our perceptions. Pinker concludes, \\"The  mind is a system of organs of computation, designed by natural selection to  solve the kinds of problems our ancestors faced in their foraging way of  life.\\"  <br />Our beliefs and desires are information, allowing us to create  meaning. \\"Beliefs are inscriptions in memory, desires are goal  inscriptions, thinking is computation, perceptions are inscriptions  triggered by sensors, trying is executing operations triggered by a goal.\\"  Pinker writes that the mind has a `design stance' for dealing with  artefacts, a `physical stance' for dealing with objects, and an  `intentional stance' for dealing with people. \\"Causal and inferential roles  tend to be in sync because natural selection designed both our perceptual  and our inferential modules to work accurately, most of the time, in this  world.\\" With this down-to-earth kind of explanation, there is no need to  invoke mysterious intangiblepowers: \\"We don't need spirits or occult  forces to explain intelligence.\\"   Pinker sums up the recent amazing  developments in neurobiology and cognitive science. This book, like those  by his colleagues Daniel Dennett (`Darwin's dangerous idea' and  `Consciousness explained') and Richard Dawkins (`River out of Eden' and  `Unweaving the rainbow'), should be required reading. They are all  Darwinians, but then why shouldn't they be? It is just like saying that all  physicists are Einsteinians nowadays, or that all poets and playwrights are  Shakespeareans, or that all osteopaths are Stillians. Their books make Karl  Popper, so hostile to Darwin, and Californian gurus like Fritjof Capra,  sadly outdated.	2000-06-07

Hardback. 622 pages. ISBN 000 255577 8<br />Richard Holmes' marvellous book is the sequel to his Coleridge: Early Visions. For fifteen years, he has been  constantly engaged with Coleridge's ideas, poems, plays and philosophical  writings. He traces Coleridge's lifelong dialogues with the greatest of  English poets, Shakespeare, Milton and Wordsworth, and also with the finest  German writers, Goethe and Schiller.<br />Coleridge was that rare creature, a  superb poet who could also grapple with the deepest of philosophers. He  could brilliantly summarise the two basic possible lines in philosophy:  \\"The difference between Aristotle and Plato is that which will remain as  long as we are men and there is any difference between man and man in point  of opinion. Plato, with Pythagoras before him, had conceived that the  phenomenon or outside appearance, all that we call thing or matter, is but  as it were a language by which the invisible (that which is not the object  of our senses) communicates its existence to our finite beings ... Aristotle,  on the contrary, affirmed that all our knowledge had begun in experience,  had begun through the senses, and that from the senses only we could take  our notions of reality ... It was the first way in which, plainly and  distinctly, two opposite systems were placed before the mind of the world.\\"<br />Although Coleridge adhered to Platonism, he honestly admitted, \\"All  these poetico-philosophical Arguments strike and shatter themselves into  froth against that stubborn rock, the fact of Consciousness, or rather its  dependence on the body.\\"<br />Like other notable literary biographies - one  thinks of Holmes' earlier one of Shelley, Richard Ellman's of Oscar Wilde,  Peter Ackroyd's of Charles Dickens, Tim Hilton's of John Ruskin, E. P.  Thompson's of William Morris, and Leon Edel's of Henry James - this  wonderful book arouses our enthusiasm for literature.

He explores touch as communicative and expressive, and  proposes a `more ethical, realistic, empathic, human' approach to manual  therapy based on a holistic concept of the body. He opposes the orthodox  medical rationale that types of touches are procedures and techniques,  based on a concept of the body as essentially mechanical.<br />He first  explores the existential meaning of touch, and its potent effects. Touch is  the ground of all our other senses. It is not limited to a single organ:  the whole body is the organ of touch. He emphasises the mother's key role  in infant development: her touch is \\"supremely important in influencing the  existential, psychological and physical development of the fetus and  newborn infant.\\" Touch deprivation leads to poor physical, social and  emotional development, failure to thrive and even death. Flesh is both  subjective and objective; it is lived, \\"but it is also of the earth and  therefore willingly succumbs to a certain degree of material  analysis.\\"<br />He then explores what happens when the manual therapist  touches the patient. He asks us to \\"realise the extent to which my body  reliably reflects my attempts to integrate my environment, my  relationships, my thoughts and feelings.\\" Mind and body form a unity;  psychology is indissolubly intertwined with physiology. He shows how  over-emphasising either element of this unity leads to a polarised duality,  of a disembodied psychotherapy and a mindless body therapy.<br />Touch  contains the potential for the most powerful blend of physical and  emotional healing processes; manual therapists can help to resolve  psychologically and emotionally generated bodily disorders. He concludes  that shattering the belief that manual therapy is only a  mechano-physiological discipline opens up extraordinarily creative  possibilities. This book presents a powerful and well-grounded rationale  for osteopathy, but it should also prove most valuable to all who use  manual therapy to care for people.<br />Will Podmore 348 wordsconcludes  that shattering the belief that manual therapy is only a  mechano-physiological discipline opens up extraordinarily creative  possibilities.
