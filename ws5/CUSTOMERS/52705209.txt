He wrote a successful novel based on that experience, but then declined into writing potboilers under a pen name.  Now he is rediscovering himself.  Some bottles of Joe's homemade wine, salvaged from Pog Hill, seem to have mysterious properties, and lead Jay into the impulse buying of a French chateau in Lansquenet, where he joins into the smalltown atmosphere and begins to write a new novel.<br /><br />The story alternates between memories of Pog Hill, the small town he lost (converted into upscale housing developments) and Lansquenet, the small town he has found and wants to keep.  All is not as it seems in Lansquenet, especially with his neighbor, and forces are at work to make the town into another tourist destination.  Jay finds himself caught up in events, and drinking Joe's wine (his \\"specials\\") seems to bring back Joe, and redirects Jay's life.<br /><br />There is something about the specials, and unexpected value in Joe's seed collection.  There is more than one way to revive a town that is in decline.  And the blackberry wine, well, that is the last bottle, and you have to read the novel to get there.	2005-10-12

When the British evacuated from the island in 1940, many residents stayed behind.  They are now in dire straits.  The German occupiers limit their food rations to the point that residents are driven to desperate measures to survive.  There is a thriving black market.  Attractive women, and even some not so attractive, augment their food rations by consorting with German soldiers, particularly officers who can supply their needs.<br /><br />There is a split in the German command.  Major Lentsch is an administrative officer, but has no control over the construction operations fortifying the island, and no control over the head of the German police.  Ned Luscombe, a British police officer trapped on the island when he stayed behind during the evacuation, has been made the local police inspector after mass arrests of members of the police force.  When Lentsch's woman friend Isobel is murdered, and her body dumped in a German fortification off limits to the Guernsey civilians, Ned is given the job of investigating the case (Isobel had at one time been a love interest of Ned).<br /><br />There is a large cast of characters hard to keep track of - native islanders, Germans, and forced laborers brought in by the Germans to build the fortifications.  Everyone has his or her own agenda.  The story is interrupted by a large number of flashbacks to explain past events and relationships.  It is a slow read, and it is sometimes difficult to maintain an understanding of a plot element.<br /><br />The Germans are losing the war, having suffered big defeats at Stalingrad and in North Africa.  Some, like Lentsch, see the handwritten on the wall.  Others remain rabid Nazi's loyal to Hitler.  In the meantime, the murder case in turning over stones exposing other crimes.  There is a somewhat surprising ending.	2005-10-04

He went to college on a hockey scholarship and, after graduation, returned home to work for Stratton Corporation, the mainstay of the town's economy.  He worked his way up the corporate ladder and became CEO after the death of the previous CEO who owned the company.  Tax problems in the family caused the owners to sell Stratton to Fairfield Corporation, a large holding company in Boston led by Willard Osgood.  Stratton Corporation is now being directed by corporate suits in Boston led by Todd Muldaur.<br /><br />A downturn in the economy and an overcapacity in the office furniture business, compounded by outsourcing by some companies to China to obtain cheaper labor, has caused Stratton to lay off half its workforce.  That affects every family in Fenwick and Nick becomes known as Nick the Slasher, the most hated man in town.  Nick's troubles were compounded by the death of his wife in a traffic accident, and he now is dealing with a rebellious 16-year old son who seems to be doing drugs.<br /><br />Nick shoots a man who he believes is stalking his family, and his boyhood friend Eddie Rinaldi, now chief of Stratton's security, helps him cover up the killing.  The police are now involved, and are closing in on Nick and Eddie.<br /><br />At this point Nick finds that Stratton's Chief Financial Officer has been working behind his back, making decisions that Nick was unaware of.  Rumors are floating about the corporate world that Stratton is on the block, to be sold to Chinese interests.  Nick has been working to save the corporation and the town, and drastic action is needed.  Eddie has his own means of obtaining information, including finding passwords for encrypted messages.  This becomes a power struggle within the corporation.<br /><br />The story leads to a blazing finale in more ways than one.  Nick must save the corporation and, at the same time, save his family.  There are questions of who are friends and who are enemies.  And there is the question of which people will end up as the goats..

Dead bodies are found in an upscale apartment - people brutally tortured and murdered.  Then there are additional deaths, and homes are torn apart by someone searching for something.<br /><br />A person connected to the victims dies of a heart attack in Trinidad, and someone is trying to steal his yacht from his widow, Beth.  This leads to a chase around the West Indies as Wolfe is drawn into the case.  A bunch of black hats get killed along the way, but those are spear carriers.  The main villain walks away clean (except he loses what he was looking for).<br /><br />Beth and Wolfe acquire some interesting allies along the way, but they find that they have to be careful who they trust.  There are a lot of technical details about sailing mixed in with explicit sex and some amount of violence.  Overall it is an interesting story as various details of the case come to light.	2005-09-11

The story tends to jump back and forth between plots, which makes it somewhat difficult to follow the story line.  Initially, they do not seem tied together, but eventually they come together, more or less.  I was left with the impression that I was coming into the story somewhere in the middle.  Did I miss a prequel about the characters?<br /><br />Molly Cates is obsessed with her father's death.  In an attempt to spare her the details, well meaning people ruin her life.  She finally comes to closure as she learns the sordid details, including the evil details of a former sheriff.  \\"Oh what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive.\\"<br /><br />The second plot involves a radical group planning an attack on the Texas State Senate.  This involves a different group, unrelated to the first plot, although connected to acquaintances of Molly.  Homeless people learn of the plan, and one attempts to contact Molly.  Molly is off chasing her obsession with her father.<br /><br />The story finally comes to a blazing finale.  The white hats win, and various people come to grips with their pasts.	2005-09-03

Joey Perrone was thrown off a cruise ship by her husband of two years, Charles \\"Chaz\\" Perrone.  Part of the story is in determining why he tried to kill her, and part of the story is in what she will do to get even.  She decides to allow only a select few to know that she is still alive, and plots to drive Chaz over the edge.<br /><br />There are the usual zany collection of individuals found in Hiaasen's novels, including Karl Rolvaag, the investigating police officer who has two large pet snakes.  Karl is curious about Chaz's involvement with Samuel Johnson Hammernut, a large landowner suspected of many things including agricultural pollution and enslaving farmworkers.  Then there is the strange man in the Everglades who calls himself Captain, the hairdresser Ricci who had been Chaz's mistress, Tool who ran a crew of farm laborers for Hammernut until being recruited for more evil deeds, and Tool's new found friend Maureen who he rescues from a nursing home.<br /><br />Of course there is a bag of untraceable cash, in this case 500k in blackmail money.

In this case there is no prince available that is of a suitable age to rescue her.  As in the case of the young girl in Andre Norton's \\"Scent of Magic,\\" she is taken in by an older woman and finds that she has magic power to do other things.  In this case, Elena becomes the apprentice of a fairy godmother (although a human one rather than a real fairy).<br /><br />The book starts out well, but then becomes somewhat bland with the long explanations of the Traditions.  The plot picks up a bit when she acquires a Champion.  There is the usual dark side and white side of situations, and an evil black sorcerer to deal with.  The novel seems to be written at the teenage to young adult level.<br /><br />As in other stories by the author, she creates supporting characters along the way who she then abandons.

The newspaper is now being managed by corporate suits whose attention is on the bottom line rather than the local news.  Jack Tagger, a staff writer on the paper, finds himself demoted to writing obits after irritating the corporation's chief executive.<br /><br />Writing an obituary gives new direction to Tagger's career after the deceased, James Bradley Stomarti, is indentified as the musician Jimmy Stoma, well known by Tagger's generation.  Digging into Stoma's death raises questions.  Stoma's widow, Cleo Rio, does not seem unhappy about his sudden demise, and is using the death as PR for her own career.  Tagger links up with Stoma's sister and others to carry out his own investigation.  Things can be deadly as other people are attacked and/or killed, and homes are ransacked.  Someone is looking for something.<br /><br />Cleo Rio claims Stoma was producing her new CD, but there is some mystery about just what Stoma was producing.  There is unpublished music involved, and a question about who owns what.  People are maneuvering for control if they can find the music.<br /><br />Meanwhile, back at the newspaper, there is a separate power struggle.  Foreign corporations are trying to take control.  The newspaper's previous owner has a large block of corporate stock which is key to the issue.  Tagger finds himself in the middle of both power struggles and, in the meantime, is obsessed with finding out what happened to his own father.<br /><br />This is one of those novels that the reader gets involved in, and it will keep you up late to get to the end.

It is almost impossible to protect people from a dedicated assassin.<br /><br />Army Major Sean Drummond, a JAG recently enlisted into the CIA's Office of Special Projects, is assigned to the case.  He has some relevant experience in his past.  He finds himself teamed with a behavioral scientist from the FBI.  They become intangled in the petty infighting among individuals who seem more interested in what they will personally get from the case, then in solving the murders.<br /><br />The action takes place over a couple days as they try to unravel the mystery of who is doing the hits.  Things become highly dangerous when they discover that the black hats have sophisticated military weapons.  Primary suspicion falls on an individual they can't find.  The motives are initially obscure, but it seems to be about extortion for a very large sum of money.  Things don't seem to ring right with Sean, but he can't seem to put his finger on what is out of place.<br /><br />The author has done some very good writing, and the novel will keep you up late.

A scientist has discovered an age retarding agent.  It can improve/restore a person's health and give a longer life.  He has moral concerns about releasing it for use, but the corporation he is associtated with is interested in profit at any price (including mayhem and murder).<br /><br />This becomes a battle between various groups, some known and some unknown, that want the information.  There are moles in the organization, and double dealing.  A lot of people know about the discovery, and some get into things over their heads. A hardened criminal ex-cop named Frick is hired by the corporation as head of security and given free reign to get the information; but is he working for the corporation or for himself.<br /><br />An assortment of spear carriers are drawn into the plot on both sides.  Some are expendable (on both sides).  Frick is willing to execute anyone he finds inconvenient, including disobedient henchmen.  The action picks up with various chase scenes and shootouts.  Frick has managed to become the dominant male in local law enforcement.  Attempts to bring in outside help are hindered by people's tendency to tell the truth, which sounds like a fairy tale.  A little less truthful story might have been better (drug lab, fight between drug cartels, use your imagination and explain things after the cavalry arrive).<br /><br />Sam, a mysterious man with an unknown past, is on the island recuperating from injuries.  He has some talents and contacts of his own, but a tendency not to kill anyone unless pushed to the limits.  The white hats know the territory and the people, a decided advantage.  The black hats are mostly imported bad guys from Vegas who sometimes trip over their own feet, and are sometimes lucky that Sam does not permanently put them down.<br /><br />The main problem I found with the novel (the reason I won't give it five stars) is the author's tendency to show off his knowledge by including technical information that can leave a reader glassy-eyed when the reader just wants to get on with the story.  This is a bad tendency some authors have.<br /><br />The novel contains a small amount of sexual content and a lot of violence.  I would put it at the PG-13 level.

Their employment goals needed to be broad enough and flexible enough so that they could adapt.  It is also helpful to be street smart.  As I have pointed out to friends, there is a significant difference between being book smart and being street smart.  A street smart person will survive in an urban jungle, and avoid being eaten by tigers.  It is all very well to have an interest in writing, music, art, or acting, but keep in mind that poets can starve.  It is necessary to have enough marketable skills to obtain a day job in order to pay the rent.<br /><br />The heroine of the present novel, Sarah Pelletier, left Brown University with a BA in English and a Phi Beta Kappa key, but not much in the way of survival skills.  Universities don't seem to teach that subject.  She discovers that employers expect people to have knowledge of things like Powerpoint presentations, financial spreadsheets, and making coffee (it would also help if you could bake cookies for the break room).  She does have some useful skills such as knowing how to clear jams from copy machines.<br /><br />After a number of jobs that prove to be temporary, Sarah is unemployed.  She could go back to school for an advanced degree, and make herself even more over-qualified (there is no shortage of lawyers and MBAs - I know one MBA who ended up as a payroll clerk).  She continues to send out resumes and learns the art and pitfalls of resume writing.  Some of her contacts are not that useful, and there is a little back stabbing.  She draws her unemployment checks, and keeps trying.  She does turn into a bit of a grunge, sleeping in late and dressing down (every day is casual Friday).<br /><br />When you finally find Mr. Right at the same time that you find the Perfect Job, and they are at opposite ends of the known universe, what do you do?<br /><br />The story gets a bit heavy on discussions of motion pictures and music, which is the reason I did not give it five stars.<br /><br />Finally, I would refer you to my pulp fiction short story \\"Lila\\" in the March 2005 issue of SpinningS Magazine (an e-zine) for a story about outsourcing, pink slips and, well, other things.es and music, which is the reason I did not give it five stars.

Rumpole is writing his memoirs, and looks back on his first big case as a young barrister.  It includes his first meeting with the Timsons, and his first meeting with Hilda, \\"She who must be obeyed,\\" the daughter of his head of chambers.<br /><br />The story is presented in a series of flashbacks from the present.  The case was the murder of two RAF veterans who had flown Bristol bombers during World War II.  The son of one is accused of the murders, and Rumpole finds himself handling the defense.  All is not as it seems, and a lot of work by Rumpole digs up the dirt.  He also develops his early interest in bloodstains.  Along the way, there is some discussion of Rumpole's early love interests, and his beginning relationships with the clerks in the law offices.<br /><br />We also get introduced to Rumpole's interests in food and wine, and his various habits that appeared in the stories dealing with a more mature Rumpole.  The book generally fills in his early career, starting with military service in World War II, and his law school training following the war.	2005-08-03

There are a few glitches.  The author seems to ignore the earlier British discovery of the Antarctic Peninsula (see \\"Below the Convergence\\") and seems to claim that George Vancouver never entered the Columbia River (although Vancouver traveled upstream far enough to sight and name Mount Hood - see the biography of Peter Puget).<br /><br />Anyone who has worked for a government bureaucracy will recognize the problem of the petty infighting over who would be in control.  If a person could not be in control, that person was unwilling to cooperate.  Being in control took priority over getting the work done.<br /><br />Charles Wilkes comes across as a man who had skills as a scientific administrator, but little experience in seamanship.  Manning the expedition seemed to depend more on connections than ability.  Nevertheless, the expedition had some amount of success, producing marine charts and new scientific information.  Wilkes comes across as a pompous typrant, seeking personal glory, and jealous of anyone under his command who was more able than himself.  He was somewhat like Captain Cook, demanding all journals and writings from individuals on the expedition so that he would personally be the author of the final report (James Cook did that at the end of his second voyage).  He became a law onto himself when he was far from home waters and government authority.  He was court martialed at the end of the voyage, but only reprimanded.<br /><br />The author does provide an afterward giving the fate of various individuals involved in the voyage.  Charles Wilkes (like William Bligh in the British Royal Navy) later became an admiral, but was relieved of his command during the American Civil War for exercising some of the same high-handedness that he displayed during the Ex Ex voyage.	2005-07-31

The problem is that various people know about the money, or find out about the money, and everyone seems to have a scheme for getting their hands on it.  A bag contains about $1.5 million, and the bag keeps changing hands.  It is undocumented, untraceable cash, and as long as it is not in official custody nobody can prove that it actually exists.  A big temptation for everyone, including some police officers, community activists, and even an exotic dancer.<br /><br />State cop Bill Tasker finds himself caught in the middle as people steal the bag, have it stolen back, and it becomes like a complicated three shell game where nobody is sure who finally has it.  Nobody can report a theft without implicating themselves.  A few dead bodies are left along the way, and the FBI, state police, county police and local police have to figure out who can be charged with what.<br /><br />Along the way there are some conflicts between blacks, hispanics, and whites; and some additional conflicts between the FBI, state, and local authorities.	2005-07-27

The romance part dominates the story.  The main setting is a beachfront estate in the Hamptons owned by a family with moderately old money - not an old family in terms of the Mayflower, or a nouveau riche family, but one with money several generations old; long enough to breed good manners.  The main story takes place during a weekend house party which includes a lot of name dropping status seekers trying to be in the right place with the right people.  To quote an expression I remember, \\"You can put a saddle on a cart horse, but...\\"  The author, like some other authors, has apparently included her personal fantasies in the story.  The graphic sexual content gives the novel an R rating or, in the alternate system, an AO rating for adults only.<br /><br />Maggie Harding, an interior decorator, has accompanied her friend Lucy to the party.  Lucy works for a PR firm and had made arrangements for the party, the purpose being to screen a new film starring the man engaged to the house owner's daughter.  The Friday night dinner turns into a disaster, more like a redneck affair than a chic social gathering.  This is interpersed with Maggie's discovery of an old acquaintance at the party, the male half of a weekend affair several years earlier in Florida; Tyler Brody, someone she had hoped never to see again.  Action switches to the bedroom and a long scene on the renewal of the affair.<br /><br />On page 80, the story introduces the murder mystery when Maggie is awakened to the screams of a woman house guest who has just found the dead body of a male house guest on the back lawn.  The action from that point switches back and forth between the murder investigation, and activity between Maggie and Ty, who can't seem to keep their pants on when the victim's body is barely cold.  Ty seems to have a one track mind, and Maggie offers little resistance.<br /><br />It was my personal opinion that the heavy sexual content detracted from the murder mystery, to the point of being a little unrealistic, i.e., the main characters seem to have a cold attitude towards the victim, even though they help solve the case.t detracted from the murder mystery, to the point of being a little unrealistic, i.e., the main characters seem to have a cold attitude towards the victim, even though they help solve the case.	2005-07-19

Forester wrote many novels, including \\"The African Queen,\\" but is best known for the successful Hornblower series.  The novels were written out of order and, in this novel, Forester stepped back to fill in the details of Hornblower's service as a lieutenant.  This is the novel where he first meets Bush, who figures prominantly in other novels in the series (up through \\"Lord Hornblower\\" where Bush is killed).<br /><br />The story is well known, although the latest motion picture (made for TV) series changed the details.  Hornblower and Bush are serving under a somewhat sadistic captain, until the captain falls down a hatchway, is disabled, and later is conveniently killed.  Hornblower is given the chance to distinguish himself, and plays a major role in carrying out the ship's successful mission.  He survives when others fall.<br /><br />Hornblower is given a field commission as Commander but, alas, the Peace of Amiens brings a temporary end to the war, and his commission is not confirmed.  He finds himself on the beach as a half-pay lieutenant under stoppages, supporting himself as a whist player.<br /><br />It is his ability at whist that puts him in the right place at the right time, and leads to the next novel in the series, \\"Hornblower and the Hotspur.\\"  This is also when he meets the woman who will become his first wife.<br /><br />Forester was an exceptional writer, particularly when filling in Hornblower's early career after the fact.  Most of his novels were about naval warfare, although \\"The General,\\" \\"Rifleman Dodd,\\" and \\"The Gun\\" were about land warfare.  \\"The African Queen\\" was a somewhat unique book, taking place during World War I, mostly on a river - it was a popular motion picture.	2005-07-16

The author seems to include all of her personal fantasies.  Mixed in with that is a large amount of violence, including some kung fu, and some gruesome murders.  At best it is an R rated novel.<br /><br />Along the way there is a plot.  Mag Callahan discovers her boyfriend has been cheating on her, and was careless in covering his tracks, a bad mistake.  Don't cheat on a hot tempered redhead.  After trashing his belongings, she seeks him out, only to find him strung up like a side of beef.  She is knocked out and wakes up naked in a motel.  Then the flight begins.<br /><br />She hides out under an assumed name in Seattle, and reluctantly accepts the help of Davy McCloud.  She is being stalked by an unknown person she refers to as Snakeman.  He is obsessed with her body, and has a tendency to kill anyone who he thinks may have offended her.  Bodies are left strewn about the landscape (one stuffed into a freezer), sometimes just to cover his tracks.  The stalker is a psycho serial killer, who sometimes kills just to satisfy an inner craving.<br /><br />An evil group of people want something that they think Mag has, but she doesn't have a clue what it is.  They think she was involved in stealing it.  Events lead Mag and Davy back towards the scene of the crime, and a confrontation.  As usual with this type novel, the cavalry arrive in the nick of time, and more bodies are left strewn about.<br /><br />The novel is undoubtedly of more interest to women than men, as men will probably find it overly mushy, although men might like the kung fu and such (a little something for every reader).  The novel is generally well written, but I found myself skimming in places to get past yet another panting sexual encounter.  Mag and Davy seem to have a hard time keeping their pants on, even in the face of extreme danger.	2005-07-16

It has often been said that generals plan tactics based on the last war.  Napoleon had developed tactics based on an artillery barrage followed by an attack by infantry and cavalry.  The British Army was still trying to use those tactics at the start of World War I, ignoring the change in armaments which included the introduction of machine guns.<br /><br />Herbert Curzon is an officer from the old school, entering World War I in command of a lancer regiment, expecting to charge the enemy on horseback.  Command of machine guns had been relegated to a lieutenant \\"who did not sit a horse very well,\\" and most officers did not study the tactics of their use.  They did not expect to fight on foot, and did not carry entrenching tools.  The machine guns quickly became the most critical part of the battle, and men had to dig in the best they could in the muddy ground.<br /><br />The British were slow to learn new tactics, and still adhered to the tactics developed by Napoleon well into the war.  Curzon is given promotions, partly because he survives and impresses the War Office with his reputation for holding his positions, and partly because he marries the daughter of a Duke who has a position in the government.  He rapidly rises to Lieutenant General and Corps commander.  The novel ends when he is badly wounded trying to rally his men against a German offensive which is breaking the British lines.<br /><br />The novel illustrates the muddle that occurred during the war.  Officers had little experience trying to handle the orders necessary for the movement of half a million men, and there was an insufficient number of experienced officers.  Reserves were in the wrong place, roads became clogged preventing movement, officers had a fixation on large assaults across torn up ground that their own artillery had rendered impassible.  It rained, turning land into swamps where the artillery had destroyed the drainage systems.  Changes to tactics were very slow.  Observations were by balloons and airplanes instead of cavalry patrols.  Tanks were introduced, but too few, and not readily accepted by the generals.<br /><br />Hundreds of thousands of men were lost for little purpose.  It is truly amazing that the government did not totally collapse, but they did not have the news media of our present day; and they had almost hysterical patriotism, with young women publicly shaming men who would not volunteer to go to the front.<br /><br />The novel ends halfway through the war, when Curzon is badly wounded.<br /><br />The novel was published in 1936.

She had been a vice president in a corporation until her ethics caused her to blow the whistle on corporate wrongdoing.  So, using her business training, she goes into a different line of work and becomes a high priced courtesan.  As she puts it, \\"Just lucky I guess.\\"  She gets her referrals from a sex therapist - someone she knew in school who has a mail order psychology degree from India and a thriving business improving people's libidos, an equal opportunity business using both courtesans and gigolos.<br /><br />Things are going well until a client ends up naked and very dead, with an icepick in his back lying face down on Lydia's bed.  That leads to some interesting conversations with the investigating police about the nature of her business.  It also involves Lydia in the investigation as she tries to prove that she did not commit the crime.<br /><br />Lydia discovers things she did not know about some of the people in her life, and meets various interesting people along the way.  Characters introduced in the story are her celibate roommate Paddy Riordin, a priest who administers to the needs of the moles living under Grand Central Station with some financial help from Lydia; Paddy's assistant Manuel, who lives in a dumpster as a matter of choice; Dr. Sylvia Kahn, the sex therapist friend; Angelica Linscott, the wife of the dead client (who does not seem to be overly crushed by his death); Captain Amy Liu of the police, who has some marital problems of her own (women should learn that primitive hunks are for weekend entertainment, not for marrying - there comes a point when you have to talk to them); and Danny Bloomster, a self centered gigolo who had been servicing Angelica and others for a price.<br /><br />The case has its twists and turns as Lydia tries to identify the killer, and puts herself in some danger in the process.  She declines to make herself an instant millionaire by cashing in on a secret Swiss bank account she discovers in the process (probably the same ethics that got her fired from the Corporation).  The mystery is finally solved, but Lydia ends up unemployed again, or so it seems.

He has become a non-person.  He does not appear anywhere in the records - no driver's license, no credit cards, no permanent address or voter's registration.  He travels by bus, stays in cheap motels or hotels, uses ficticious names (currently the names of second basemen from years past), pays cash, and changes clothes every four days (he does not believe in luggage).  His source of income is unknown.<br /><br />When six people are shot in a midtown plaza, the suspect asks for Reacher, someone he had known 14 years earlier during the Gulf War in Kuwait City.  The problem is that Reacher wants to put him away, so why did he ask for Reacher.  Reacher shows up on his own, having seen a report on TV while playing house with an airline stewardess in Florida.<br /><br />All is not as it seems.  The evidence in the case in ironclad, perhaps too ironclad.  It implies that the suspect would have been incredibly clumsy, and does not match the actions of a trained sniper.  And why only six shots??  The people killed are all seemingly non-entities - hardly the people who would be targeted by an assassin.<br /><br />Reacher is getting ready to leave town when he is set-up and attacked, not a good move as he is tougher than the attackers. So now he stays around.  He discovers a company as mysterious as himself, operating as a subsidiary of an offshore corporation with no local listing.<br /><br />People with knowledge end up missing.  Someone is covering their tracks.  Reacher gradually unravels the case, and there are some surprises.  Along the way he acquires some temporary allies, including an ex-marine and a TV news anchor.  He leaves the final wrap-up to others as he fades from the scene.<br /><br />When last seen he was on a bus heading for Seattle.  Readers will need to wait for the next case.

When wars break out, they often become tar babies, i.e., sticky situations easy to get into but hard to get out of.  Two years ago a young woman in Japan asked why the United States used atomic bombs in 1945.  I told her it was to end the war; the options for accomplishing that were limited; and all of them involved a large number of deaths.  Regular diplomacy had failed.<br /><br />The present novel is set during World War I, mainly on the Western Front somewhere in France.  The war has become a stalemate and the armies are bogged down in trenchworks facing each other across No Mans Land.  Most people have long since forgotten the original issues, but the war drags on endlessly.  The politicians have not been able to bring it to an end.  Poison gas has been used.  The generals expend men by the tens of thousands in useless assaults against the enemy that accomplish nothing.  The generals just ask for more men.  Boys as young as 14 are drafted and sent to die at the front.  An entire generation is decimated, with young men not living long enough to realize their potential.<br /><br />This is the tragic tale of a group of German soldiers including Paul Baumer, the narrator, and several of his classmates who drop out of school and enlist in the Army after a teacher appeals to their patriotism.  It covers the time period from his entry into the German Army at the age of 19 until his death on a quiet day in October 1918, just before the end of the war.  The novel begins with the soldiers at the front the day after a heavy bombardment by British artillery.  There are some flashbacks to their initial training.<br /><br />The soldiers have developed a fatalistic, somewhat cold attitude.  Deaths in the company mean more rations for the survivors.  When a dying man says someone stole his watch, the attitude is that he is not going to need it anymore.  One person maneuvers to get his boots when he dies.  Individuals are concerned with their own survival, and acquiring whatever comforts they can get their hands on.

Death is random, depending on where an artillery shell may land.  Every soldier has his dream of what he would like to be.  One by one they are whittled away.  They decline into an attitude of dispair.  They know they can't win, but the war drags on seemingly without end.<br /><br />Paul is the last survivor.  He dies a meaningless death on a quiet day on the Western Front when not much is happening.

In this novel she has a side plot about fox hunting with references to details that the readers have to figure out for themselves.  Perhaps readers in the UK are more familiar with the issues.  This is compounded by the repetition of some plot material from one novel to another.<br /><br />There are young children running about who do not seem to be in school, some of them exploited by their parents (a cook in an inn, a dog watcher in London).  One has to wonder, expecially when an Inspector from Scotland Yard is on the scene.  Does the country have no child welfare?<br /><br />The novel does have its moments.  Inspector Jury meets his new upstairs neighbor, Carole-ann Palutski, who figures into following plots.  Carole-ann is a 19 year old bombshell who can look 30 if the occasion calls for it.  Fool that he is, Jury fends off Carole-ann's advances because he considers her too young.  Instead he becomes involved with an older woman which almost leads to his death.<br /><br />The novel has a dark ending which was not really necessary to the plot.  I guess the author has a fixation on tragedies (kill the good people along with the bad.  Let God sort them out).	2005-07-02

The copyright date is 1984.  The year is 1798, and Lieutenant Matthew Lamb, after the mandatory six years service as a midshipman, has received his commission as a lieutenant in the Royal Navy and we find him reporting aboard the HMS Sturdy as the new fourth lieutenant, replacing a man who broke both legs in a fall.<br /><br />The frigate is immediately on its way to join Admiral Jervis, the Earl St. Vincent, off Cadiz.  After some patrolling in the Strait of Gibraltar, they return to witness a hanging of a mutineer - a man who had the effrontery to present demands to Admiral Jervis.  There are discussions running through the novel about naval discipline.<br /><br />The frigate then leaves for the Indian Ocean via the Cape to help track down privateers.  The John Company has been losing East Indiamen, and has put pressure on the government to send Royal Navy ships.  They end up in various action, including escorting a convoy.  Some plot material brings to mind earlier writing by C. Northcote Parkinson in Dead Reckoning, and a later novel in the series about Jack Aubrey (although, at the moment, that title escapes me).<br /><br />The novel comes to a blazing finish which obviously leads into the sequel.  After the third novel in the series, Lamb in Command, the series seems to end with various events left unfinished.  I have not established the reason for the series ending in midstream.	2005-06-29

In this case, a woman fleeing from a cheating husband and marital problems steps into the life of an identical twin after the twin is murdered.  It turns out the twin had money - lots of money along with a young daughter.  Some people have to be let into the secret, but it is a closely guarded secret.<br /><br />The thugs who killed her sister are thrown into confusion.  The more they try to solve their problem, the greater the complexity of the problem.  Various characters are drawn into the plot including the dead woman's mother, a couple of police officers willing to mete out their own justice, a neighbor of the dead woman, and two mysterious men under the pier who seem to move about silently like smoke, or maybe like guardian angels (one never knows).<br /><br />Maggie finds an odd assortment of allies as she takes on a new life.  You may think some of the black hats are going to walk away free, but don't be too sure.  Some people are tougher than they look, especially women who feel their children are threatened.<br /><br />I disagree with the publisher's assessment that stories are hard to write.  I have found that stories are relatively easy to write, but very hard to get published.  Everyone wants to be a writer, and editors are very selective.  I do agree with the assessment that reading novels is better than watching TV.	2005-06-27

It is set primarily in Oklahoma during the 1920s and early 1930s, mainly in the oil patch and coal mining area.  It tells about the lives of two individuals, with various supporting characters, real and fictional.<br /><br />Carlos \\"Carl\\" Webster is the only son of a pecan grower who made his fortune from oil leases on his property.  A wanted criminal steals his ice cream cone when he is 15.  At the same age he kills a man for the first time when he shoots a man trying to steal his cows.  He becomes a Deputy United States Marshall, and becomes something of a grandstander, a \\"make my day\\" type lawman.<br /><br />Jack Belmont is the only son of a man who made his millions wildcatting in the oilfields.  He grows up undisciplined and spoiled, with a mean disposition.  As a teenager, he kills his first man when he shoots a black teenager during a race riot.  He kills people for no particular reason other than the fact that he is mean.  He served time in prison, operates a prohibition era roadhouse furnishing liquor and women to patrons, and occasionally robs banks.<br /><br />The paths of the two protagonists cross and recross as various other people are dealt with including various bank robbers, members of the Klan and members of the Pendergast Machine in Kansas City.  A magazine writer follows the action, interviewing people on both sides in order to write stories for the magazine.  Dead bodies are left littering the landscape.  If the author does not quite know what to do with a character, he has the person shot.  It's a dangerous world.<br /><br />The writing style is not always completely grammatical.  The story is what one of my acquaintances would call earthy, and expresses the white protestant attitudes of the time period, i.e., anti-Black, anti-Italian, anti-Indian.  The story might offend some readers.	2005-06-24

I had a hard time maintaining an interest.  Part of the problem is the writing style, and references to some locations in England that I had a difficult time visualizing.  Perhaps it needed a map.  Part of the plot seems to revolve around possible gay relationships but, as Inspector Jury notes, does anyone in today's world really care.<br /><br />The story starts out with characters from Long Piddleton who are off in Venice.  The time period is about ten years after Jury made his first appearance.  There is concern that a woman may marry the wrong person, and schemes are hatched to redirect the romance.  Apparently you need to read a prequel to completely understand the situation.<br /><br />The scene then shifts back to London with a plot involving the death of a woman Jury has just become acquainted with.  From London, the plot shifts to an estate in a country village, and the various family members and associated individuals who are connected to the dead woman.  A couple of previous deaths are brought into the plot.<br /><br />Along the way, you get a description of driving on a bad road, which really has nothing to do with the plot, and a description of various characters at the Old Contemptibles, an Inn in the village, who don't really figure into the main plot (the author has a habit of putting various excess baggage into her stories).<br /><br />It becomes a question of who has any advantage from the deaths that have occurred.  It is a question of power, and the ending seemed a bit strange.  The original plot reimerges briefly.  Then some of the characters mete out their own form of justice, at which point the story ends.	2005-06-19

The plot seemed to wander, as Milo goes from town to town, and character to character, trying to find out who is trying to kill him (and why).  Part of it is a little transparent, and part left to the ending where he confronts all the suspects and explains all.<br /><br />I found myself skimming some parts as the book digresses in Milo's past, etc.  Various characters are killed off (or are they) as they outlive their usefullness.  Not quite like Mark Twain's device of having people wander outside and fall down a well, but more a case of bullet riddled bodies.<br /><br />The author has gone out of his way to put in more twists and turns than a country road through the hills.  The novel contains graphic sex, language, and various forms of violence.  Don't expect all the black hats to be punished.  Some people, including Milo, get away with murder.	2005-06-16

Gayle Lynds' \\"Masquerade,\\" which seems to predate this novel by a couple years, also deals with an international assassin for hire.  Her sequel, \\"The Coil,\\" has a similar shadowy international group.  I am still waiting for her next novel.<br /><br />The early parts of this novel by Silva seem a little fragmented and superficial, with some parts a little peripheral to the main plot.  It comes together better as the novel progresses.  There is the shadowy international group of people with money and influence who are willing to use assassination to disrupt the peace - in war and disorder there is profit.  There is a CIA employee and his wife, a lawyer for a Washington firm, who seem to be the white hats.  There are newspaper reporters, intelligence agents, and politicans.  Everyone has their own agenda, and you can't really trust anyone.  Double crosses abound, and some people are not entirely what you think they are.<br /><br />Of course there is the assassin, trained to kill since he was a teenager.  A man without a known face, planted by the Soviet Union under deep cover, and eventually going independent, taking assignments through his handler.  He is a cold blooded killer willing to kill anyone who can identify him, and he has his money well concealed.  He has many identities, and is fluent in many languages.  He looks forward to retirement after this \\"last job,\\" and there is no trust between the assassin and his employers.  If a painter moves into your neighborhood (landscapes and portraits), and he leads a quiet life, has a taste for moderate priced wine, and does his own shopping and cooking, well...<br /><br />It's hard to say if there is a winner in this novel.

It is a little on the dark side, and a change of pace from the author's early novels in the Jury/Plant series.  No side excursions into Long Piddleton, or side issues about flashers.  Perhaps the author was developing a more serious side.  You do need to read some of the earlier novels to understand the Jury and Plant characters.<br /><br />The story starts with a prelude about a murder where the wrong man is convicted.  The only witness, the victim's 5-year old daughter, is left catatonic and unable to point out the killer.  The wrong man is convicted of the crime and sent off to prison, simply because he was infatuated with the victim.<br /><br />Now it is 20 years later.  A serial killer is murdering children in the same geographic area as the earlier murder.  It appears to be the work of a psychopath.  The police are attempting to link the killings and various suspects show up on the scene - the man, just released from prison, who was convicted of the earlier murder; an agoraphobic photographer who seems a bit mysterious; and various relatives who might inherit money if Lady Jessica, a 10-year old heiress, should happen to die.<br /><br />Events and police work bring the story to some surprising conclusions.

It is the type plot that one might expect from an author like Jack Higgins, but it is better written than the recent Higgins novels.<br /><br />The plot goes through many surprising twists and turns.  Phil Shanahan, an American living in Europe, has a business as a yacht surveyor and sometimes delivers boats to various locations for the owners.  He has been asked to deliver a sailboat to Miami from somewhere in the Med.  The catch is that the boat will have a special cargo of $5 million in gold coins that are to be smuggled into the country.<br /><br />Nobody trusts anyone else, and Shanahan is suspicious of the assignment.  Also, $5 million is a big temptation, and Shanahan has ways of creating new identities for people and boats, either of which can disappear.<br /><br />There are Arab terrorists involved, Provisional IRA members, and a lot of assorted bystanders, all of whom are not what they seem to be.  And there is the question of long-term deep undercover agents.<br /><br />Shanahan gets in over his head, and plans do not work out as envisioned.  There are some surprising final twists at the end.<br /><br />The anti-American theme does raise a question in my mind.  How, exactly, do you define American?  It is like saying Asian, Black, Muslim, etc.  All of those are very broad terms.  The United States is a very complex country that has many parts and pieces that people from outside the country do not understand.  The country has always been a large melting pot of people from diverse origins having diverse religious and political viewpoints, much more so than any other part of the world.	2005-06-01

The setting is a large city in northern England, but it is not clear, in this particular novel, which city.  Perhaps the author expected readers to have read the earlier novels in the series.  The story is a complex plot about a serial killer.<br /><br />The story, like many others by Jack Higgins, takes place in a very short period of time - less than a week.  A number of young women of the evening have been killed by an unknown assailant called The Rainlover in the press.  Another murder occurs, but it does not quite fit the pattern.<br /><br />The plot is complex, and a suspect emerges early in the story, but all is not quite as it seems with the last murder.  An escaped criminal (a cat burgler) enters into the story to complicate matters.  The final climax has the usual makings of a Jack Higgins novel as everything ends in a final battle.<br /><br />I would note that I bought the novel for some light reading, and stayed up late to finish it.  It is brain candy rather than great literature, but most certainly does not deserve the one star rating of the previous reviewer.  If he is a Jack Higgins fan, I am not sure what he was expecting, particularly if he has read previous novels in this series.	2005-05-22
233197:US	52705209	RPBJVILXT8QMB	0440102804	670331490	The Anodyne Necklace	Books	4	8	9	N	N	A reissued Richard Jury novel	I am looking at the January 2004 Reissue by Onyx.  The original copyright is 1983, so don't be surprised by the reference to Princess Di.  The settings for the novel are London and the small suburban town of Littlebourne.  The Anodyne Necklace is the name of a working class pub in London.<br /><br />The storyline is interesting, with a mugging and a couple of murders that have to be drawn together.  The story revolves around a valuable stolen emerald, set into a necklace.  The thief, who had been a trusted personal secretary to the moderately wealthy owner, was killed in an accident shortly after the theft.  He left a clue to the location where he concealed the jewelry, but the clue itself became concealed.<br /><br />Now it is a year later.  People who might have knowledge about the necklace are being assaulted and killed.  There appears to be an unknown accomplice to the theft.  Richard Jury and Melrose Plant track down the information, and leads take them in various directions, including a Wizards snd Warriors game.  It seems that the deceased thief was a master of the game, and the clue seems to be in a game map.<br /><br />The plot is complex and seems, perhaps, to be overly contrived in places.  The author seems to have a fixation on flashers (they have shown up in other novels), and in this novel we have Ash the Flash and his young son, Friendly.  The flashers seem peripheral to the main plot.<br /><br />The novel has a surprise ending when the identity of the accomplice is revealed.  It is not great literature, but provides an interesting whodunit for light reading.<br /><br />A previous reviewer is incorrect in stating that this is the first novel in the Jury/Plant series.  The first novel in the series is \\"The Man with a Load of Mischief.\\"  I believe that this is the third novel in the series (there is a Listmania listing available, prepared by a different reviewer).  A local bookseller has recently stocked the full series, so I believe the full series has been reissued.	2005-05-21

It is not great literature, but provides some light brain candy.  Lots of bodies are left lying around as people are killed by various means (shooting, drowning, incineration, torture, falling off a roof).<br /><br />An Arab fanatic, annoyed by U.S. and Russian oil interests exploiting his country, decides on a high profile assassination.  Nothing seems to work out for the bad guys, but some of the British ended up wounded.<br /><br />The story has an interesting ending with a very rich woman with a grudge, biding her time, and planning to spend portions of her wealth to get revenge.  It brings to mind Matilda of Flanders (wife of King William I) who, spurned by a Saxon nobleman when she was a teenager, waited 20 years until William conquered England, then tracked down the Saxon and had him thrown into a dungeon.	2005-05-02

It can be read as a stand alone book, but you will lack some of the background.  It is a complex plot involving elves (mages and not so magical), humans (free and slaves), halfbloods (who mostly seem to have wizard capability), dragons, and some really dangerous creatures that inhabit a particular forest, including an invisible ambusher.<br /><br />The elves, who have invaded the planet through a magical gate, only occupy part of the territory.  They have long lives, but a low birthrate.  Considering the various intrigues and dangers, it is amazing that they could last as long as they have.  Everyone seems to lust for power, but power corrupts.  A revolt by younger sons (mostly somewhat inept), various slave revolts, halfbloods seeking their own power, attempts at assassinations, interference by dragons, and creatures that eat occasional wayfarers make for an interesting plot.<br /><br />Some of the action seems to drag at points.  It was not a page turner until it got towards the end.  Various inconvenient characters are removed, not quite like Mark Twain's device of having people wander out into the yard and fall down a well, but by introducing various dangers they encounter, inserted into the story for that purpose (a large carnivore, a murderous machine, or just being carried off by a hungry demon looking for dinner).  Some characters are nasty pieces of work, so one does not waste much sympathy on their plight.  Somehow the white hats survive.<br /><br />The hero, who is against slavery, has a couple concubines purchased from the market.  He is a long-lived elf, and at thiry is still in his adolescence, so has not found a wife.  He is living with his mother, and has not seemed to reach the maturity needed for a marriage (or maybe he is just overly picky).	2005-04-27

Dead Reckoning, the last novel in the series, has a copyright date that indicates it was written two years before the present novel.  The present novel fills in details of Delancey's career during and immediately after the Peace of Amiens.  It explains his marriage to Fiona, and his promotion to Captain.  It is not great literature, but I don't think it merits the one star given by a previous reviewer (there are ratings between one and five - I reserve one star for really awful books).<br /><br />While I would not recommend the novel as a stand alone novel, it is an essential part of Delancey's career if you are a Delancey fan.  The main problem seems to be that the author got carried away showing off his historical knowledge, and included a bit too much detail when you wanted to get on with the action.  It does have a plot, largely related to Napoleon's plan to invade England, once Delancey goes back on active duty.  It involves action on shore, secret agents, etc.<br /><br />It does get into the English political system, covers patronage and influence, and raises the interisting question as to whether it would be good or bad if the Prime Minister was killed, i.e., would the war progress better with someone else in charge.<br /><br />Patrick O'Brien wrote a similar novel, \\"Post Captain,\\" in the Aubrey series, covering the same time period, but with better writing.  Dudley Pope wrote a similar novel, \\"Ramage & the Guillotine,\\" putting Ramage ashore gaining information about a French invasion fleet.  You have to check copyright dates to determine who was borrowing ideas from whom.	2005-04-20

Hannah Ives has formed a team for a fund-raising 5k race.  She meets a former roommate from the hospital who is in remission and looking great.  Great, that is, until her untimely death.<br /><br />Hannah becomes involved in a Web of insurance fraud involving the sale of beneficiary rights to insurance policies, along with policies sometimes fraudulently obtained.  It is a crime story as much as a mystery, as guilty parties are often obvious well before the end of the novel.  However, there is a surprise at the end.<br /><br />Her writer friend, Naddie Bromley becomes involved.  It helps that some of the criminal element are not overly bright, often the case in real life.  The action builds as you approach the end of the novel, and it will keep you up late finishing it.<br /><br />In regard to the fundraiser at the start of the novel, I was part of Christie's Team at the 2005 Relay for Life fundraiser in Vicksburg.  Our's was a walk.  The teams had booths.  Christie's Team sold balloons, donuts, hot coffee and cocoa, bottled water, sno-cones, popcorn, and cotton candy.  It was overnight from 7 PM to 7 AM.  There was live entertainment, and competitive events between teams.	2005-04-08

I did not like it as well as the first two, possibly for the same reason I do not watch afternoon soaps.  The first half of the book deals with family matters.  Hannah's father is 70 and a widower.  Hannah and her sisters are displeased that he is chasing after a younger woman.  Hey ladies, he may be 70 but he's not dead (especially with Viagra on the market).<br /><br />After getting through the soap opera part of the novel, the mystery appears in the second half.  A death occurs and Hannah's father disappears.  Various characters are introduced in the novel, and all are not as they seem.  The second part of the novel was more interesting, but not enough so to give the novel five stars (although if you like afternoon soaps, you will probably like the novel).  Events seem to lead into a sequel.	2005-04-05

The problem is that he will not give Tess all the information she needs on family matters, and even lies about some details.  She must work her way through a mire of relationships and friendships to determine how to find the woman and her children.<br /><br />Tess is helped by networking with other women PIs on the Internet, transmitting digital photos and other infomation.  She is also helped by an insider, i.e., one of the children is trying to contact his father.<br /><br />Everyone has guns and there is some collateral damage.  The story is a page turner that will keep you up late to get to the end.  My main complaint is that some people just seemed to walk away and fade into the sunset.  There were major crimes committed, and some accessories just seem to go on their way.<br /><br />Along the way, you might learn more than you want to about Jewish holidays and customs.  You will also pick up a few pointers on working the system.  I might add that Tess is growing apart from Crow in this novel, so we will have to wait for the next novel to see what develops.	2005-04-03

I had a childhood accident where I remember starting to fall, and my next memory is having bandages removed from my leg some period of time later.  I was left with a large scar and no memory of the intervening time period.<br /><br />In this novel, Hannah Ives has a younger sister who is undergoing counseling.  Her analyst has convinced her that something buried in her past is causing her problems.  She recreates her childhood in her mind, but are the resulting memories real or fantasies?  Was she really abused by someone as a child?  What she thinks she remembers is causing a major turmoil in her family.<br /><br />Hannah Ives gets involved in some sleuthing, intermixed with reconstructive surgery after having breast cancer.  Hannah's own life is put in danger as the mystery is solved.<br /><br />The novel could be classified as a tragedy.  Events are somewhat unfinished as it ends with her sister still in counseling and trying to resolve her past.  What really happened when the family was in Sicily?  It deals with mature subject matter, and I would probably rate it at about the PG-13 level.	2005-03-30

I purchased the novel after reading \\"I'd Kill for That,\\" a round robin mystery edited by the author.<br /><br />The plot is set in a small town in Maryland.  Hannah Ives has gone to stay with her sister-in-law.  When a body is discovered, an old case is reopened, and suspicion falls on a number of people.  Everyone is not as they seem.  A lot of information was covered up eight years earlier, and things are going on in the small town.  Hannah finds her own life in danger as she opens up a can of worms.<br /><br />The author is from the area used for the setting.  It can be assumed some portions of the plot are drawn from her own experience.  The story is well crafted.	2005-03-27

It is a good story, but the author digresses a bit too much into side cases and seems at times to be getting onto a soapbox.<br /><br />My main thought, considering all the sex crimes portrayed, don't women ever bite?  At the very least, the man's screams would attract attention.  And a man dropping his knife and being allowed to pick it back up?  Isn't that the time for a swift kick into his private parts?  Surely some women would be a little more agressive.  Also, the manufacturer of the Black Widow indicates that it is quite effective against muggers.	2005-03-25

This novel presents a cat's view of the world.  When people end up murdered, the cat, aided by her erstwhile dog companion, sets off on its own sleuthing.  They are somewhat the Holmes and Watson of the animal world, and have far better senses than the humans around them.  There are communications problems with the humans.<br /><br />It should be remembered that cats have claws, and dogs have teeth; something the villain seems to forget.  The cat and dog join in as clues lead to the discovery of the guilty party and connections are revealed between the victims and the killer.<br /><br />Along the way, you are entertained by various events in small town life.  Much of it revolves around the Post Office where people pick up there mail, and where the postmistress reads the postcards.<br /><br />The novel is recommended for teenage to adult readers.  It would be of particular interest to anyone who shares living arrangements with a cat.	2005-03-19

The chapter about the church service, by Julie Smith, was a real hoot.  The final chapters get into intrigue and machinations by some of the nouveau riche.  Some people seem obsessed with wealth and social trappings.

It is two plots run in parallel, neither of which seems as well developed as they could have been.  The hero is Mako Hooker, a former contract assassin for the government who is now well past his prime.<br /><br />One plot is about the damage to small vessels, e.g., fishing boats, in a somewhat undefined (fictional) area of the West Indies.  Fishermen claim a monster is eating the vessels.  Well, a lot of superstition as Mako tries to track down the cause.  Technical details are a bit of a stretch, and various red herrings are introduced to add complexities to the plot.  To some degree, the plot goes off in too many directions.<br /><br />The second plot is about big business, tourism, intrusion of outsiders into a native culture, and bad guys getting involved in legitimate businesses.  It can make one wonder who the bad guys really are.  A company wants to shoot a motion picture in the area.  A cruise line wants to add it to its port-of-call.<br /><br />Mako is called out of retirement to deal with the problems.  He survives in spite of himself.  Other agents show up out of his past, including a female agent who is shown in a bad light.  It seems to imply that female agents are overcome by PMS and unreliable.  A couple of baddies get offed, but not by Mako.  An attractive young rich woman becomes fascinated with Mako, and the story seems to fade away into the sunset.	2005-02-19

It is a crime novel, not a mystery.  Details of the criminals and their planned robbery are known from the start.  The story is in the action.  I would note that the cover art on the dust jacket has no relevance to the story.  The story concerns Jesse Stone, chief of police of Paradise, Massachusetts, his ex-wife, various women he is sleeping with, his problem with alcohol, his interactions (good and bad) with local residents, and a gang of criminals planning the robbery of the century.

Hence, I found this publication.  The price may seem a little high.  It is only 37 pages of stories as the first story starts on page 9.  It is printed in a pamphlet format with stapled binding.  That is offset by some very good writing.  So, the cost of admission may seem high, but you are treated to a good performance.  I would note that $6 is a common cover charge by clubs in this area for an evening's entertainment.<br /><br />The first story, \\"Hell Hath no Fury...,\\" is about a bard getting the true story from a baroness about her mother's affair with a bard.  The second story, \\"Mrs. Bailey's Harp,\\" is about a harp with some magical properties and contact between worlds, a poignant story that might bring tears to your eyes.  The third, \\"Scarborough Fairy,\\" is about a wicked fairy up to naughty tricks.  The fourth, \\"That Which Feeds the Soul,\\" illustrates that you should not always believe what you hear.

Travers is trying to get the loanshark off his buddy's back, and trying to track down the missing money.<br /><br />The novel did not hold my interest very well, and I found myself skimming to get to the end.

For those who like fantasy, Diana L. Paxson has put together a collection of 22 short stories and one poem.  These all involve women in various settings.  Like most collections, you will find some that you favor over others.  The last one in the collection (\\"Love Potion No. 8 1/2,\\" by Marilyn A. Racette) reminds me of stories written by the late Dr. Asimov about a helpful demon that tried to please people (be careful what you wish for).  A couple of the stories are a little surreal, and plots vary considerably although they are in the realm of fantasy.  I particularly liked \\"Necessity and the Mother,\\" by Lee Martindale, as it illustrates how politicians pass some ill conceived laws.  I also especially liked \\"Child's Play\\", by Esther M. Freisner.  It would be difficult to rate the others in order of preference.<br /><br />Other short stories in the collection are \\"Dawn and Dusk,\\" by Dana Kramer-Rolls; \\"Spell of the Sparrow,\\" by Jim C. Hines; \\"The Woman's Place,\\" by Susan Urbanek Linville; \\"Kin,\\" by Naomi Kritzer; \\"Ursa,\\" by Jenn Reese; \\"Red Caramae,\\" by Kit Wesler; \\"Parri's Blade,\\" by Cynthia McQuillin, \\"Sun Thief,\\" by K. A. Laity, \\"Lostland,\\" by Rosemary Edghill; \\"Plowshares,\\" by Rebecca Maines, \\"Step by Step,\\" by Catherine Soto; \\"Favor of the Goddess,\\" by Lynn Morgan Rosser, \\"Rose in Winter,\\" by Marie M. Longhin, \\"Kazhe's Blade,\\" Terry McGarry, \\"The Skin Trade,\\" by Heather Rose Jones, \\"Multiple Choice,\\" by Leslie Fish, \\"Oulu,\\" by Aimee Kratts, \\"A Kind of Redemption,\\" by John P. Buentello, and \\"Journey's End,\\" by Dorothy J. Heydt.  The one two-page poem, \\"Sword and Sorceress,\\" is by Jennifer G. Tifft.<br /><br />The editor should be commended for putting together the anthology.  She is correct that authors need outlets for their short stories, as most magazines only take about one or two percent of what is submitted, if that much, and it can be difficult finding a magazine to match a particular story.	2005-01-29

In the meantime she is looking for Uncle Fred who has disappeared.  Fred is a tightwad who was disputing a bill from a trash collection company, and wants a $2 refund because they missed collecting one day.  That sets off a chain of events resulting in various murders and an attempt of Stephanie's life.  As usual with Stephanie, there are several plots intertwined including Ranger's enterprizes, her work as a bounty hunter for her cousin Vinnie, her search for Uncle Fred, and her love life.  It is a fast moving plot, and I found it more interesting than the previous novel in the series.	2005-01-17

The plot seems to meander and digress.  Perhaps the characters are becoming a little worn, or the plot elements a little over-used (another vehicle turned into toast).  Some jokes are funny the first time, perhaps the second time, and maybe the third time; but after a while, you start avoiding the person telling them.<br /><br />The story has some redeeming qualities making it worth three stars, including an interesting finish.  It is like a slow horse that suddenly surges as it nears the wire.  A woman has an interesting way of dealing with an ex-boyfriend who abused her (nothing like putting the thought in women's minds); and some people get away with a large chunk of undeclared income stashed somewhere outside the country.  Some forms of crime might pay - it depends on whom you steal from.<br /><br />The author does have an interesting name for a scooter not big enough to be called a hog.	2005-01-09

Working for her cousin Vinnie as a bounty hunter, she goes out on what should be a routine case and discovers it is anything but routine.  As bodies pile up, her life is threatened, her hamster is threatened, and her ex-husband is threatened (which is not a bad thing in Stephanie's opinion).  She has help along the way from Ranger and Lula, as the case winds to a conclusion.<br /><br />Uncle Mo seems to be a harmless older man who has been selling ice cream and candy in a small store.  Stephanie grew up buying ice cream from Mo, and feels bad about needing to bring him in.<br /><br />People in the neighborhood think she's a pariah for going after Uncle Mo.  But everything is not as it seems.  Mo has disappeared, and the search turns up a secret life, not to mention his connection with the murders of drug dealers.<br /><br />There are a few sidelights, like Ranger trying to get Stephanie into better physical shape; Stephanie's continued problem with vehicles; an occasional appearance of family members; and Stephanie's relationship with Morelli.	2005-01-02

It might have been a good children's book, if the author would have left out the crude language.  Instead, the author has tried to make it into an adult novel by including gutter talk.  As a result, it is neither, but is still a somewhat interesting novel.<br /><br />Stephanie is missing any Christmas spirit.  She did not mail cards, has no tree, and has not bought gifts (not even for her two young nieces).  She is visited by a man who suddenly appears in her kitchen.  He is not very keen on being there, but goes where he is sent.<br /><br />Stephanie, as a bounty hunter for her cousin Vinnie, a bail bondsman, has been seeking a toymaker who did not appear for his day in court.  All is not as it seems.  There is a power struggle going on between people with unusual abilities, and Stephanie gets caught in the middle.  She loses yet another vehicle.<br /><br />The novel is on the surreal side, but has some interesting moments.  Lula has an interesting method for doing Christmas shopping quickly, i.e., just buy whatever is near the register on the assumption that people will exchange it anyway after Christmas.	2004-12-30

In \\"One for the Money,\\" Stephanie Plum stumbled into a psychotic boxer and a drug ring.  She is now more established as a bounty hunter, but still somewhat careless, which is why she is driving her late grandfather's '53 Buick after having her car stolen.  In this case, finding a fugitive leads her into the world of illegal weapons distributors.  The plot is a bit transparent, as you can guess the ending early in the story, but the story holds your attention as you wait to see how things turn out.  She manages to wreck another of Morelli's cars, but it's really not her fault (in the last novel, his car was blown up).<br /><br />Lookout for Grandma Mazur - she has a gun and wants to be Stephanie's assistant in taking down fugitives.  Hit the deck if she starts shooting.  And Lula is back, but in a more respectable profession.  The women in the novel remind me of some of my women friends.

Stephanie lost her job, had her car repossessed, has hocked or sold most of her belongings, has an empty refrigerator, and has been reduced to sampling the food she bought for her pet hamster.  She obtains employment with her cousin Vinnie, a bail bondsman, by threatening to tell Vinnie's wife about the duck (this is left to the reader's imagination).  She is now a bounty hunter, and her first assignment is tracking down a man with whom she has a love/hate relationship.<br /><br />Stephanie is from a working class family in New Jersey, with an odd assortment of relatives and friends, some of whom pop in and out of the story.  The novel has its moments as she is stalked by an insane prizefighter who likes to hurt women, has attempts on her life, and bumbles into some major crime.  Things work out, more or less, in the end as she picks up some injuries along the way.  The future looks bright for Stephanie and her hamster, and the series continues.	2004-12-26

It ties things together historically, and intersperses accounts of naval action with discussion of the governments and politics of the different time periods.  The author notes that many battles were decided by weather, disease, and/or inept leadership.<br /><br />It is difficult to sympathize with the men who were with Hawkins.  They had attacked a village in African, killing most of the inhabitants, and carrying off the survivors to sell into slavery.  When the Spanish attacked Hawkins, killing many of his men and condemning captives to serve as galley slaves, it was a form of justice.  Drake comes across as somewhat inept, attacking Spanish ports or treasure caravans without providing means to carry off the silver bars (he seemed to ignore the weight of silver when he planned his misadventures).  The beginnings of the Royal Navy seem to be rooted in officially sanctioned slave trading and piracy.  There was a prevailing attitude in Europe that native populations were inferior and available for exploitation, with the church parceling out territories like they owned the world.<br /><br />The book covers main events involving the Royal Navy, but skims by some actions while digressing into discussions of such things as Bligh and the Bounty.  It perhaps uses rose colored glasses in looking at life before the mast, and ignores some notorious mutinies and also tyrants like George Vancouver.  There is a sprinkling of factual errors, e.g., it has the British capturing Baltimore in the War of 1812 (they were driven off), gives John Barrow the credit for documenting the Mutiny on the Bounty (William Bligh published a full account upon his return to England), and puts Bligh's second voyage 10 years after the first (it was immediately after the first).<br /><br />Some discussions in the book seem to reflect the author's opinions, but overall it is well documented.t overall it is well documented.	2004-12-05

It is filled with technical details of playing guitar, comments on different guitars, and comments about various musicians.  If you are a musician, or a blues fan, you will definitely want this book.  If you are just looking for a novel to read, you will be put off by the excessive name dropping, and may get glassy-eyed from the technical details.<br /><br />Martin's father wants him to take over the family apple orchards.  His mother wants him to go to the University of Chicago, her alma mater.  He does neither.  After a broken romance, he enlists in the Navy for a three-year hitch, then goes to work for the Railway Post Office while he pursues his interest in the blues, first as an archivist, then as a performer.  Working as a musician is summed up when Martin says, \\"It's a jungle.  No record deals in the jungle, no managers, no agents, no contracts, lousy PA systems, amateur engineers, a lot of open mikes and coffeehouses, no paying gigs.\\"  That pretty well sums up many musicians I know, although they do get some paying gigs.  Most have day jobs (one drummer I know works as a welder, a guitar player handles the business office for a florist, one band leader is a barber, etc.).<br /><br />Martin writes a book which he uses to gain entry into paying gigs, and attract the interest of a minor label.  Along the way he is helped by a former bluesman turned minister, who made his money in the automotive business after a checkered career that included a stretch in a Texas prison.  Martin experiences personal heartache which helps him play the blues, initially on a painted, galvanized steel guitar that most people tell him is junk, then on some better guitars.  He has estrangements and reconciliations.  His love across the color line reveals both tolerance and intolerance (both overt and covert).  Some people's liberal attitudes only go so far - it is OK to associate with people of color, but they don't want their child to marry one.udes only go so far - it is OK to associate with people of color, but they don't want their child to marry one.	2004-10-27

Sharpe crosses paths with the evil French Colonel Leroux, a man who will kill his own followers if it suits his purpose, and is given orders from General Wellington to hunt him down.  Events lead Sharpe into a relationship with yet another woman, and we find him cheating on his wife.

It had become a cold case, but now it is active again.<br /><br />There are two main intertwined plots, one being the case of the woman charged, Heather Malone who has lived in Lake Henry for the past 14 years, and the other being a renewed relationship between Griffin Hughes and Poppy Blake while Griffin uses his resources to get to the truth of Heather Malone's case.<br /><br />When you stir a pot, a lot of things come to the surface, and many details are revealed about various people's pasts.  Most people have things buried, and sometimes it is better to bring them out into the light and move on with life.

The original Hornblower motion picture was based on this novel and the following two novels (\\"Ship of the Line\\" and \\"Flying Colours\\").  The author later went back to fill in the details of Hornblower's early career, explaining the early relationship with Bush, etc.  You could actually start reading the novels with this one, but it is better to start with Mr. Midshipman Hornblower, and follow Hornblower's career from the beginning.  C. Northcote Parkinson wrote a fictional biography of Hornblower which fills in a fictional account of his early life.  C.S. Forester later wrote \\"the Hornblower Companion\\" which should probably be acquired when you start reading the series.<br /><br />Hornblower is sent off to the Pacific to aid a revolutionary leader who is in rebellion against Spain (an enemy of my enemy is my friend), a dangerous practice (Germany later aided Lenin to start the Russian Revolution during World War I).  After arming the revolutionary army, and capturing a Spanish ship which he gives to the rebel leader (who has him under the guns of a fortress), he discovers that Spain is no longer at war with England.  Slow communications across the ocean caused many miscues during that historical period.<br /><br />Having turned loose a rebel army, Hornblower now finds he is allied with Spain, and must now fight the rebel army he created.  He must retake the ship which he had captured and turned over to the rebels.  He is fortunate that the rebel leader is not a seaman, and prevails at some cost in casualties.<br /><br />Hornblower also acquires a romantic interest, meeting the woman he later marries as his second wife (see Commodore Hornblower), a woman with considerable influence at court.  As usual with Hornblower, he gets no prize money but lots of official recognition, so starts out in the next novel as a financially poor captain in command of a ship of the line.<br /><br />The three novels, \\"Beat to Quarters,\\" \\"Ship of the Line,\\" and \\"Flying Colours\\" should be read as a trilogy.s\\" should be read as a trilogy.	2004-08-24

The novel won the 1919 Pulitzer Prize in fiction.<br /><br />Major Amberson had established a family fortune by buying and selling land.  His children become social drones.  One son (unmarried) goes into politics.  One daughter and son-in-law wait around for their inheritance.  The other daughter marries Mr. Minafer, who has some success in business, but loses his money to bad investments.  The main story is about George Amberson Minafer, the only grandchild, who is spoiled as a child and grows up arrogant with the assumption that he is from an upper class family and will never have to work.<br /><br />The family are large frogs in a small puddle and, alas, fail to keep up with a changing society.  They are left behind in the dust.  The people George Minafer looked down upon become successful in the new industrial climate, while George's family fortunes decline.  Eventually George finds he has to (gasp) find a job to support himself and an aunt.<br /><br />The novel is slow reading, but is worth the effort.  Many students, unfortunately, are like George, and would probably not like to make the effort.  As a moral lesson, be careful who you insult.  If your fortunes decline, you may end up working for them.	2004-08-16

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote many Sherlock Holmes stories that were crime fiction, i.e., you knew the name of the villain from the start and what crime he had committed.  The story is in how the person deals with the problem.<br /><br />I had thought of many possible titles (Rogue, Renegade, Revenge, etc.), but the author chose Ricochet for reasons explained inside the dust jacket.  The novel is set in 1987 in the fictional city of Santa Teresa, California.  Reba Lafferty is just being released from prison after serving time on an embezzlement charge.  Reba is from a wealthy family, and is a late child who was spoiled and became a trial to people around her (shades of George Minafer).  She is a gambling addict with no concern for money - willing to steal to feed her habit.  Kinsey is hired by Reba'a ailing father to bring Reba back from prison when she is paroled, and to keep an eye on her while she settles back into life.<br /><br />Reba had worked for Alan \\"Beck\\" Beckwith, a real estate developer who uses women for his own purposes and casts them aside when they are no longer useful.  He has been heavily involved in money laundering, something the feds are closing in on.<br /><br />Reba is determined to square accounts, and becomes somewhat a loose cannon, dragging Kinsey along as she develops her own schemes to take down Beck.  Reba does not call it revenge, she simply wants to get even, but getting even in this case means paying him back in spades.<br /><br />Along the way, you will learn a lot about money laundering, and some of the bad guys get away clean.  Reba has no grudge against common criminals.  After all, some of her best friends are people she met in prison.<br /><br />The novel is a page turner that kept me up late.	2004-08-15

Lieutenant Matthew Lamb has been having an affair with the Port Captain's wife, and Captain Mainwaring finds it convenient to send him to sea in command of a mail packet.  With a firm belief of having a woman in every port, Lamb acquires another woman (niece of an Admiral) while stopping in Antigua, only to discover belatedly that she is a cousin of the woman back in Jamaica.<br /><br />Along the way, of course, there is some amount of naval action.  Mail packets were not supposed to go after prizes, but when plums fall into your lap, the opportunity cannot be overlooked.  So, Lamb has a woman in his life promising future romance, and some amount of prize money due when the mail packet reaches port.<br /><br />The story obiously leads into a sequel (or sequels) as some thing are left unfinished, including a lieutenant who wants to shoot him because of an alledged insult.	2004-08-13

He has the good luck to receive a transfer to a frigate commanded by Pellew (a real legendary frigate captain).  He distinguishes himself in a number of actions, commands and loses a prize captured by the frigate, commands a ship loaded with cattle, commands a boat attack on a Spanish galley, assists a senior captain during a Spanish raid with fireships, and is given command of a small courier vessel carrying dispatches, this last command leading to his capture.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good account of the varied duties that might be assigned to a junior officer.

(Teen's Top 10 (Awards))	Books	3	8	13	N	Y	3 1/2 stars for a readable tale	This is an interesting novel written in a narrative form as a fictional autobiography of a woman telling about her life.  It is a little superficial in some areas with very little sea action.  The inclusion of some of the crueler aspects of slavery, and details of murders and such, give it about a PG-13 rating.  Be prepared to read about a man caged in a gibbet being eaten alive by ravens.  Such practices resulted in the U.S. Constitution forbidding cruel and unusual punishments.<br /><br />Nancy had grown up in a sugar and slave trading family in Bristol, England.  Misfortunes have affected the family, and her father and older brothers plan to sell her into an unwanted marriage like a bale of trade goods in order to restore the family fortunes.  She is left in charge of an older brother who is a drunken gambler.  Having killed a man, she escapes into the maroon country of Jamaica along with her servants, then joins a pirate ship to escape from the island.<br /><br />The second half of the novel, from page 183 onward, describes her life as a pirate.  She becomes wealthy, is captured once but escapes, and leaves the dangerous waters (for pirates) of the West Indies to go with the ship to Madagascar.  She is pursued by the man she rejected in Jamaica, and there is a final confrontation.<br /><br />The actual time of the story is not given, but perhaps it is in the 18th century (or maybe the early 19th Century) when both slavery and piracy flourished in the West Indies.  The final pirates were caught and hanged after 1820, and slavery was abolished by the British in the same time frame.  Descendents of the maroons still live in Jamaica.	2004-08-03

Princess Emeralda, her friend Prince Eadric, and her aunt Grassina (the Green Witch) discover the ingredients needed to reverse the spell that turned the man Grassina loved into an otter. The problem is the fact that the spell requires a hair from mother-of-pearl, the husk of a magic bean, a horse feather, and the breath of a green dragon. Most of the novel deals with the adventures of Emeralda and Eadric as they go on a quest seeking the items. Along the way they acquire some dragon friends. And they need to hurry, as the army of an adjoining kingdom is preparing to invade the country.<br /><br /> The events come out a little different than planned. Grassina is not entirely sure she still wants Haywood whom she has not seen in human form for 20 years. Emeralda's grandmother is interferring, as she has never thought Haywood was good enough for Grassina - the reason she turned him into an otter. Things become complicated because some spells have hidden features that are unknown until activated. Also, you do have to be careful what you wish for, or you may get unwanted results.<br /><br /> As usual with fairy tales, the hero or heroine (in this case) prevail in the end.	2004-08-01

The first part deals with Beauty's family, which has fallen onto hard times, and their move to a remote village next to an enchanted forest.  Having set the stage and established characters, the second part is about Beauty's father and his meeting with the Beast, a meeting that places him under an obligation.<br /><br />The third part of the novel is about Beauty, who is actually a rather plain looking girl, and the events that follow after she goes to live with the Beast.  She finds he is not such a bad fellow, except for his appearance, and even her horse eventually accepts him.<br /><br />Overall this is a good tale, somewhat a romance novel, and somewhat a novel of magic and enchantment.  Like most fairy tales, it has a happy ending.	2004-07-22

Some spells backfire.  Most of the novel deals with her adventures as a frog, and her attempts to get changed back into a princess.  She acquires a different viewpoint on life as she talks to animals, learns to swim, eats flies (yuck!), avoids predators, and finds some unexpected allies.  She even learns to like snakes, at least some snakes.<br /><br />She acquires a prince in her life, although she needs to break him of some bad habits.  She has assistance from her aunt Grassina, the Green Witch, and discovers she has some powers of her own.  She does have a bad habit of tripping over her own feet.<br /><br />I would recommend the novel for girls at the pre-teen to young teenage level.	2004-07-20

The conductor was world-renouned, but was a self centered vain individual who had prejudices and vices.  He was respected but not well liked.  Some people despised him.  Guido has the task of sorting out the motives of various suspects, and digging into the past of the victim.<br />The case turns up some surprising revelations.  Guido has his own sense of justice and law enforcement.  He has to determine what to report, and how to report it.  The ending of the story is not quite what you might guess, but there are some clues along the way.<br />As in the author's other novels set in Venice, there is a lot of information about the city, and some amount of wining and dining.  Also, there is information about Guido's wealthy father-in-law, who really wanted Guido to go into banking.  As Guido puts it, they both deal with the same kind of people, but he can send them to prison while his father-in-law has to invite them to dinner.	2004-07-17

The cover size is 9 x 12 inches.  It is well illustated with large, full-color illustrations.<br />It is a delightful retelling of the story of Rumpelstiltskin.  In this version, the miller's daughter finds Rumpelstiltskin more attractive than the greedy king, and escapes with him to take up a new life on a farm.  But, later, the king discovers their daughter, and kidnaps the daughter to try to force her to spin his straw into gold.<br />The daughter is certainly not attracted to a greedy old king in his dotage, expecially one that her mother had already rejected when he was younger.  But the daughter has plans of her own for rescuing the kingdom, and she is a lot smarter than the king.<br />Like many good children's stories, this one has gone out of print.  One could hope that the publisher will reissue this one.	2004-07-15

It is 28 un-numbered pages plus the title page, etc.  The writing is simple, and most of the space is taken up by large, full color illustrations.  The recommended age range of 3 to 7 seems about right, but it depends somewhat on the reading level of the child.  This review refers to the hardbound, printed edition.  It is not suitable for an audio version as most of the story is in the illustrations.<br />Like a camel getting its nose into the tent, a mouse gets its nose into the house.  What starts out as an offer of a cookie grows into list of demands.  But all is not for naught, as the mouse cleans the house.  I would like to know where to find that mouse (I would give it cookies and milk any day).<br />I highly recommend this story for younger children.	2004-07-08

He picks an heir, or to be precise the Gods seem to pick his heir, a boy named Cauvin who is just growing into a man.  It is an interesting tale of the passing of a torch and, as in all the tales of thieves world,  there is the usual array of villains.  The Vulgar Unicorn has survived, of course, and is still a meeting ground.  The Red Light District has fallen on hard times.  Trade has declined, but occasional ships still show up in the harbor.  Sanctuary is somewhat down at the heels, and the coinage is debased.<br />This is an interesting tale about the battle against an evil cult, but it has flashbacks to earlier times.  For someone who has not read the other novels, the information is fragmentary.  For someone who has read the novels, and is fully familiar with the setting, the digressions into the past seem to be overdone and distracting.<br />The story does not quite reach a full conclusion as one of the evil people escapes.  One can guess that the author is planning a sequel.  In Thieves World, there are always stories to be told.	2004-07-05

It is a variation of the story of the sorcerer's apprentice.  It is written as a long poem with large, full color illustrations.  It is suitable for pre-school or early grade school children, particularly young girls.  The exact age depends on their reading level, but the recommended age range of 4 to 8 years old ssems about right (although I am 68 and thought it was a delightful story).  Be sure you get the book with the dust jacket because the introduction to the story is on the inside of the dust jacket (for whatever reason).<br />Sylvia goes off to become an apprentice to the sorcerer Tottibo, but discovers that an apprentice starts at the bottom doing drudge work.  She is assigned to making lots and lots of clothing.  She decides the work would be easier if she could use magic on the sewing machine, but - well, the results are unexpected.  \\"It stitched the dishes to the table, it stitched the noodles to the ladle.\\"  You get the idea.  The sorcerer finally has to come to the rescue.<br />For some reason good children's books always seem to go out of print.  Some copies are available (new and used) from secondary sources at this writing (July 4, 2004).  One could hope it would go back into print before the Christmas season.	2004-07-05

While it gives extensive details of five particular courtesans over a 150-year period of time, contrasting their beginnings, life styles, and societies of the time, the author has also included information on other courtesans as well as introductory material on the role of courtesans in the social structure.<br />Real courtesans were not prostitutes, as indicated by another reviewer.  They held a higher place in the social structure.  In a way they were mistresses, but sometimes had more than one patron.  Unlike prostitutes, they were independent, i.e, they did not have a pimp or madam.  They received callers of their own choosing at their own residence, or sometimes traveled with patrons.<br />It was helpful to be pretty, but important to be intelligent, amusing, charming, and a good companion.  They preferred patrons with the same attributes, but a patron also had to have money.  Courtesans tended to have extravagant lifestyles.  It was not uncommon for men to provide them with a life annuity.  For men, it was a sign of social status to be able to afford a courtesan, providing her with a house, a carriage, horses, jewels, money for fancy clothing, etc.<br />The account provides a good look at the society and politics of the time period.  It also illustrates the double standard, where a married man could openly have a mistress, but a married woman involved with another man could be turned out into the street in the middle of the night to live or die.<br />For a look at a French courtesan, see the motion picture &quot;Camille,&quot; although be forewarned that the motion picture has a sad ending that may make you cry.  For something more upbeat, the motion picture &quot;Gigi&quot; is about a young woman being trained by her grandmother to be a courtesan.  For contrast, the motion picture &quot;Irma La Douce&quot; is a lighthearted look at a French prostitute.  All of these are set in Paris.titute.  All of these are set in Paris.	2004-06-29

The author was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature the same year.  In reference to some of the other reviews, I would note that readers need to decide whether they want to read literature or to read brain candy.  This novel is literature and requires some amount of concentrated thought.  The author digresses and backtracks to fill in details of various characters.  He also has a tendency to philosophize.  It is past page 300 before you actually get to Humboldt's Gift.  It took some effort to get into the novel but, once involved, it was worth the effort.  Some parts are more interesting than others, especially the parts set in Chicago.<br />Charlie Citrine is a writer who is at a crisis point in his life.  His ex-wife is trying to strip him of everything he has.  He is in trouble with the IRS over past tax returns.  Investments have gone bad.  He is threatened by a hoodlum, who really wants Charlie to help his wife on a PhD dissertation.  He is having some conflicts with his girlfriend.  He is almost out of funds, but everyone thinks he is rich.<br />Charlie had been the protege of the poet Von Humboldt Fleisher.  Humboldt had early success, than went downhill.  He could be compared to Vincent Van Gogh, i.e., people were not buying his work; he was considered psychotic; and he died in poverty; but is now well regarded after his death.  He was not as crazy as people thought, and he leaves a surprising legacy.<br />The novel is a story of Charlie turning his life around, and rebounding to new found fame.  He has help from Humboldt from beyond the grave.	2004-06-17

This novel won him a second Pulitzer Prize.  It was published in 1962, the year of his death.<br />The novel is written in the style of an older man reminiscencing about his youth.  Some of the individual sentences ramble and digress, as do some parts of the story, put gradually the plot moves forward.  Not everyone will like the writing style.  I found the beginning of the novel hard to get into; but as the plot progressed it was hard to put down.<br />It is written as a first person narrative with some dialogue.<br />The setting is in May 1905.  Lucius Priest is an 11-year old boy living in a Mississippi town about 80 miles from Memphis, normally a two day drive over dirt roads if it's not raining and the roads are dry.  Boon Hogganbeck, of somewhat unknown ancestry, was more or less inherited by the Priest family and works in the family's livery stable as the night man when he is not acting as the driver of an automobile purchased by Lucius's grandfather, a banker in the town.  Ned McCaslin is the black coachman for the family.<br />When the adults in the family are called away to the Gulf coast for a funeral, Boon, Lucius, and Ned &quot;borrow&quot; the grandfather's automobile to make a trip to Memphis where they stay overnight in a bordello that Boon has visited in the past.  Things become complicated when Ned trades the automobile for a stolen racehorse.  Ned has a way with animals, and sees potential in the horse (which has previously lost all of its races).  The plot has an interesting ending, and Ned is smarter than people may have thought.<br />Along the way, Lucius learns to drive the automobile, defends a woman's honor, and learns a lot about life that he would never have learned in school.	2004-06-09

While the plot is generally well developed, it is complex and skips back and forth between various characters.  It is an interesting story of people seeking power at any price.  It some respects it is an alternate history; and it shows the Catholic church in a bad light.  It is a medieval type drama, with people using assassination, blackmail, and bribery to gain control of the Vatican.  A pope is dying, and factions are maneuvering for position.<br />The plot deals with the theft of art treasures during World War II.  Readers might have an interest in &quot;The English Assassin&quot; by Daniel Silva, which deals with that issue and the peculiarities of Swiss Law about ownership.	2004-06-05

What starts as a fire investigation and the death of a vagrant, rapidly escalates into the exposure of a web of crime and corruption.  As in real life, criminals sometimes are their own undoing.<br />The murder of one man leads to the murder of another, and then another.  Investigations tie events into the murder of a woman 10 years earlier, and information comes to light on circumstances related to other deaths.  As leads are developed, trails lead into other states, and a vicious prostitution ring is revealed along with drug dealing.<br />Your sins will find you out, and many people discover to their chagrin that people keep records.<br />This is a good novel to take to the beach.

An illiterate farmer buys himself a wife and has several children before being forced off the land by a drought.  When a mob storms a wealthy man's house, the farmer's wife finds a cache of jewels which they steal.

The main protagonist, Melanie, has married into money and has heaps of cash to use.  People have a choice to either be trailblazers, leaders, or followers.  Melanie's ambition is to be a member of high society, which initially makes her a follower.  One management book calls it &quot;entering the hut.&quot;  There are certain rights of passage to become a member of a group.<br />Melanie finds that she must deal with society snobs who are from &quot;old families&quot; and have gone to &quot;the right schools.&quot;  Many of them are shallow social drones, who go from one luncheon, dinner party, or benefit to the next.  Their ambition is to be noticed by society photographers, and they compete to live at the right address.  With the help of her butler, who delights in educating his &quot;Eliza Doolittle,&quot; Melanie strives to fit in, and the snobs strive to keep her in her place as ex-trailer trash.<br />The story starts out funny, but gets repetitious with a few too many &quot;charity committees.&quot;  Apparently Melanie never thought about using her money to be a trailblazer, i.e., starting her own club, charity, etc.  People are also not astute about using available investigative services, and Melanie gets halfway through the plot before she thinks about using an internet search.  I personally cannot fathom the competition to live at some address in the cramped confines of the concrete canyons of New York City.  I suppose if you get on a high enough floor you would have what some people call a view, if they don't know any better.  I suppose it would be OK to have an apartment in the city to have somewhere to squat while in town to attend the theater, but people with real money can afford to buy their own islands (and don't need to work in the city).<br />I would point out to the authors that the softest fabric comes from the belly hair of muskoxen.  It is in short supply and is incredibly expensive if you can find it.  Cashmere varies in quality from upscale Scottish cashmere to run-of-the-mill Mongolian.  Occasionally you can find fabrics such as alpaca or vicuna.is incredibly expensive if you can find it.  Cashmere varies in quality from upscale Scottish cashmere to run-of-the-mill Mongolian.

It is somewhat a mixture of the three.  There are two main protagonists.  The first is an Australian aborigine, Alfie Woodard, who served in the Australian Special Air Service, then became a shaman who walked down the dark path before becoming an enforcer for an international drug dealer.  Alfie has a habit of painting primative pictures in his victims' blood, and cooking and eating parts of their bodies, part of a ritual from the dark side.<br />The second protagonist is Charley Payne, a former member of United States Army Special Forces, who became a contract killer for the CIA.  He dropped out of the CIA work (but is still in their active files) and became a forensic photographer for the Minneapolis police department.<br />When Alfie murders one of Charley's friends along with the friend's family, Charley chases after him, going to Australia for revenge.  Charley is able to activate old assets, as his former employer has an interest in both Alfie and Alfie's boss.<br />Some of the novel may seem a little unrealistic, but surreal novels tend to be that way.  There is sorcery and connections to a dream world.  Some parts seem a little unfinished, as you may wonder what happened to some of the secondary characters, but overall it is a good story if you like this type of fiction.  I prefer stories that are not surreal, but rated it based on its genre.  I will pass it on to a friend who likes this type novel.<br />I would give the novel an R rating based on content.  It is not a story for children.	2004-05-22

It is the fictional account of relationships of a young girl from about the age of 5 to the age of 13, including incest with her brother and father, affairs with boarders in the family home, affairs with neighbors, affairs with strangers, and affairs with a couple priests.  There is nothing about an adult woman.<br />The novel should not be listed with children's books.  It is XXX rated, with graphic descriptions of activities.  The content is the type that could cause a police raid on an adult bookstore.  I would have returned the book for a refund, but I do not send this type material through the mail.	2004-05-19

It starts out with a number of seemingly unrelated incidents.  The author apparently knows where he is and when he is, but it would be nice if he would share that with his readers.  The novel then proceeds with a bunch of parallel plots, jumping continually from one to another.  That is compounded by the author occasionally telling you how to build a watch when you just wanted to know the time.  Do we really need a manual on building sound suppressors for handguns?<br />The various plots eventually start to come together but, by that time, I was losing interest and skimming over substantial amounts of material trying to get on with the story.  I regret that I followed the advise of the majority of reviewers, who rated it with four and five stars, and purchased the novel.  It is a skimmer rather than a page-turner, and it is not on my listing of recommended novels for other readers.	2004-05-14

You need to set aside a significant period of time for this (when I first read the novel 40 years ago, I used a week long break between school terms).  The story is about a Russian nobel family and their friends and associates over an extended period of time.  Young children grow up, get married, have children, and take over the family estates.  It is set during (and after) the Napoleonic Wars, the setting being in Russia (to a very large extent in Moscow, but some on country estates).<br />Tolstoy was a member of the nobility and, by standards of the day, could have been considered a social reformer trying to improve the lot of the peasants.  You will usually find a character in his novels that reflects his own attitudes (but not the principal character).  He wrote and published novels in installments.  To produce this properly in a film media would require making a lengthy TV series, somewhat like &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs.&quot;  I am surprised that has not been done.<br />The novel covers the rise and fall of the fortunes of the family and the people around them.  The family's fortunes are shattered by a variety of circumstances including bad management of money and the French invasion.  Partly the head of the family puts the welfare of others ahead of his own family.  When the French are at the gates of Moscow, and they have wagons to save their belongings, they leave their own possessions behind in order to use the wagons to rescue wounded Russian soldiers.<br />Eventually, the next generation is left with the task of salvaging what remains and restoring the family fortunes.	2004-04-30

It is the story of Edmund Dantes, falsely accused and sent to prison.  While in prison, he learns about a valuable treasure.  Contriving to escape, he recovers the treasure and sets himself up with a new identity as a wealthy nobleman.  While many people would have enjoyed their wealth, Edmund is obsessed with revenge against the people responsible for sending him to prison.  He is willing to destroy not only those people, but also their families.  Money can buy a lot, and he expends large amounts of his new found wealth on elaborate schemes to ruin the people.  Down deep, he is actually not a nice person, and you do not want to get on his wrong side.  He holds grudges and pays people back in spades.	2004-04-30

The story is well known.  A man who blacks out during seizures, not remembering what happened, is falsely accused of theft of money from his church.  He is shunned by his former friends and becomes a recluse.  When he is later robbed of his savings, and an abandoned child appears on his doorstep in place of the gold, his life is changed as he takes responsibility for the child.<br />This is classic literature from that time period, and is most certainly easier to read than many other novels from the same period (students should consider themselves fortunate that they were not assigned to read one of Thomas Hardy's novels).  I first became acquainted with the novel when it was assigned reading in a high school English class.  That was over 50 years ago, and the story is one that has stuck in my mind.	2004-04-29

It is a compelling story of a simple working man, Jean Valjean, caught up in the French \\"justice\\" system of the 19th century.  His crime was petty.  He broke into a bakery to get bread for starving family members (in the modern United States, he might have received probation).  Because the baker's family lived in the building, he was charged with breaking into an occupied dwelling and sent to prison.  In France, you were required to have a passport to travel within the country.  Released from prison, he is given the infamous \\"yellow passport\\" issued to people with criminal records.  An act of heroism allows him to obtain work without showing his passport, but his past catches up with him and he is sent to a prison galley for life for a second petty crime in his past as a \\"repeat offender.\\"<br />He escapes and recovers a cache of gold that he had buried, then rescues the orphan daughter of a woman he had known, but is pursued by the relentless policeman Javert, a man who has no compassion and enforces the law to the letter.<br />Jean Valjean is a simple man and, basicly, is trying to help other people.  The system does its best to grind him down.  It is notable that the story ends when people are taking to the streets and building barricades in a fight against the very system that led to his troubles.	2004-04-25

High unemployment provides a surplus of labor which farm and orchard owners can exploit, paying them as little as possible, and gouging them further with high prices at the \\"company stores.\\"  Attempts by workers to advance themselves were held down.  The law is on the side of the landowners.  It was an era when workers were easy to replace so little thought was given to their safety and welfare.<br />This was an era that gave rise to labor unions, and open warfare between employers and unions.  Accounts are available elsewhere of incidents such as the Everett Massacre.<br />It should be noted that the author received the 1940 Pulitzer Prize in fiction for this novel.  He later received the Nobel Prize in literature.	2004-04-25

The author won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1958, but his government denied him permission to accept the prize.<br />The novel is a compelling tale of the events during and after the Russian revolution.  People are caught up in events not of their own choosing, over which they have no control.  The old order collapses to be replaced by a new order coming out of the revolution.  Families are torn apart.  Dr. Zhivago is separated from Lara, never to find her again (the motion picture includes the enduring song, \\"Somewhere, My Love\\").<br />One of the scenes that sticks in my mind is a battle where men are ordered to fire on the \\"enemies,\\" i.e., people opposing the politicians running their side of the struggle.  One man simply aims at a tree on the battlefield.  Occasionally someone chances to come between him and the tree.  He considers it a matter over which he has no control.<br />It is an example of politicians using people as pawns to fight their opponents, the opponents being people who might otherwise have been their friends.	2004-04-25
694267:US	52705209	R2DDCGZ7LVFFP9	0743214625	165981602	Seaflower: A Kydd Novel (Kydd Novels)	Books	4	10	11	N	Y	Life before the mast	This is an interesting novel, the main character being Thomas Kydd, a seaman in the Royal Navy during the 1790s.  The novel is a little weak when it comes to describing action against the enemy (some actions seem a little superficial) but gives good accounts of fighting bad weather and generally surviving aboard a ship of war.  John Nicol's autobiography, &quot;John Nicol Mariner,&quot; is a good account of a seaman during that time period.<br />In actual fact, during that time there were more losses from disease, storms, shipwrecks, and accidents in general, than there were from enemy action.  The description of Kydd's survival after coming down with yellow fever would be typical for the location and time period.  Frederick Hoffman in his autobiography, &quot;A Sailor of King George,&quot; related his experience aboard a ship where he was one out of 16 midshipmen, and one out of two who survived a yellow fever epidemic.  The survivors lived to tell their tales, so stories are naturally about survivors.  There was reputedly an old toast in the Royal Navy for &quot;a long war or a fever season,&quot; i.e., others misfortunes opened opportunities for promotion.<br />While it may seem a little unreal for a ship or officer to have one success after another, such officers did exist at that time and many, including Nelson, achieved rapid promotion by their successes.<br />There were young men from well-to-do families who ran off to sea for various reasons (just as some later joined the French Foreign Legion).  Some survived and achieved success.  The character of Nicholas Renzi is believable.	2004-04-24

I think that the recent response to SARS illustrated how the world in general would react.<br />The main problems I had with the novel were (1) a few too many subplots running in parallel and (2) a lot of digression into excruciating details of bacteriology, computer engineering, telephone message scrambling, etc. (far more than what is needed for the main plot).  The author seems to be trying to show off his technical knowledge to the point where the average reader might be left a little glassy-eyed.  It reminds me of old expression about asking someone the time, and having the person tell you how to build a clock.<br />Most of the white hats survive, and the main black hats are eliminated.  The novel treats the bacteria as characters in the story, and some bacteria always survive.	2004-04-22

The present novel is set in Venice.  The investigation of the murder of an elderly woman is mixed in with Brunetti's interaction and conflicts with other police, Brunetti's home life, and comments on fine dining, wine, etc.  There is considerable local color on Venice and the hot summer climate, comments on local and Italian politics and bureaucracy, discussions of tax evasion, and problems with prosecuting people guilty of crimes.  Overall, an interesting novel if you are not familiar with Venice and want a picture of the city.<br />The story revolves around the murder of a stingy old woman who is described as a shrew hated by almost everyone.  Many people would have motives for her murder, so who did the deed?  The investigation reveals some surprising information.  Brunetti is willing to overlook theft, tax evasion, poisoning animals, people with false documentation, etc. if he can solve the murder.  He is not beyond breaking a few laws himself.<br />The case is solved with a surprising ending, and a question as to how much actual \\"punishment\\" the killer will receive.	2004-04-20

It starts out with a kidnapping which seems to be partially explained later in the novel, but not very well.  There seem to be a lot of spies and intelligence service people tripping over their feet, and sleeper agents who are not very well placed.  People seem to be dashing about in all directions.  One would like to think that intelligence services operate with some amount of intelligence and well trained personnel, but perhaps that is wishful thinking.<br />The author tries to wrap things together later in the novel with an explanation of some grand scheme to plant misinformation, but by that point I had lost interest.  It is the usual case in the spy business, i.e., you don't know who is working for whom, and you may not be sure of who you are working for yourself.  You really can't trust anyone.<br />In this novel, various people have been blackmailed or seduced into spying, which would usually produce unreliable agents.  It would be better to find someone willing to sell out for money (the usual case), or perhaps someone with a grudge against the establishment, perhaps someone who did not get a promotion which they feel in their own mind that they merited, i.e., a Benedict Arnold type.<br />I would note that the real sleeper agents at the start of World War II tended to be well placed, e.g., the one at Scapa Flow or the one in Honolulu, where they could provide valuable information.	2004-04-18

I had trouble maintaining an interest, particularly in the early part of the novel.  Part of the problem seems to be the writing style.  I found myself going back to reread sentences to figure out what was being said.  Perhaps it is just awkward sentence structuring.  There is also a lot of digression into side issues involving various characters.<br />The basic plot is interesting, involving a man who is not particularly good looking, but who leaves his wife for another woman.  The other woman is a greedy type who is willing to lead him into a life of crime for her personal benefit.  The problem is proving the crime, particularly after Wexford is accused of harassment and forced to officially drop things.  The case extends over about 18 months.<br />The final solution has some surprises, more or less, but I guessed the &quot;surprise&quot; early in the plot, probably because I have seen a similar plot device used elsewhere.  Like most Wexford mysteries, guns do not enter into the plot.	2004-04-15

Like many novels, it is a mixture of truth and fiction.<br />During the late 30s, large amounts of cash and various valuables were deposited for safekeeping in Switzerland, much of it by Jews facing persecution in Nazi Germany.  This was followed during World War II by various Nazi government officials either concealing ill-gotten gains, or laundering the proceeds of loot collected from occupied countries.  Now there are problems identifying the accounts and recovering assets, particularly when Swiss laws work against original owners and their heirs.<br />A secret cabal is willing to use lethal means to conceal information and bury the past.  This includes using intelligence agents in foreign countries, and employing an assassin to eliminate people considered to be a problem, sometimes with substantial collateral damage.  At times it is spy vs. spy.<br />Some of the action seems a little improbable, e.g., a seemingly indestructable agent (shades of Fearless Fosdick), criminals who suddenly develop a conscience (as the Corsican Don points out, they are hired to do a job, not to worry about whether the victim is good or evil), and some people who seem to trip over their own feet.<br />Overall, and interesting novel, although some parts of the plot material (such as an international assassin) have been used elsewhere by other authors.	2004-04-12

The references to money, with an indication that 120 pounds sterling was a large amount that made a man flush, needs to be taken in the context of the time and the country, i.e., the UK where pay scales may have been a quarter the amount in the US.  The amount noted, at that time a little under $300 in US funds, would not have been exceptionally high by US standards even in 1969.  I also had a bit of a problem with the writing style as the author tends to jump from one character and scene to another while going from one written sentence to the next.  It would be nice to have a break indicating a change of scene, even a blank line on the page.  This is an editorial problem which I blame on the publisher.<br />The plot is complex, and initially starts out with a number of seemingly unrelated events.  It involves marriages, mistresses, children, a dog, some amount of crime, of course a couple murders, people not cooperating with the police, and class distinctions with some working class people just trying to keep their heads above water.<br />When the police investigate a man's murder, the investigation opens up various cans of worms.  There are people making a little money on the side, women looking for rich men, men looking for rich women, married men chasing around, and the police trying to tie everything together.  Overall an interesting plot of 201 pages in this edition.	2004-04-09

The author assumes you have read previous books in the series, as references are made to previous events without clearly explaining them.  Most of the action takes place on land or aboard moored ships.<br />Much of the plot material has been used before.  Patrick Obrien's novel &quot;Post Captain&quot; found Captain Aubrey in debt after his bank failed, and sent him on a quest for prize money to satisfy his debts.  Various novels have included fictional accounts of the mutinies at Spithead and the Nore (See C. Northcote Parkinson's &quot;The Fireship,&quot; Richard Woodman's &quot;A King's Cutter,&quot; etc.), although this novel puts a different spin on the story.<br />This is a readable novel, although the hero comes across as a somewhat boneheaded fumbler at times, who gets his men killed to satisfy his quest for gold.  It seems to alter history in some areas, e.g., I recall that a significant number of mutineers were hanged after the Nore Mutiny.	2004-04-08

The individual stories deal with a wide variety of characters, ranging from poor southern rural families to Yankee families with old money.  Some stories deal with minorities.  The individuals are placed in a variety of circumstances, e.g., &quot;Home&quot; deals with a lesbian relationship.  Some stories deal with older people comtemplating death.

There is wife swapping, a corporate pimp, shell companies, creative accounting, greed, and a presidential wannabe who can't keep his pants zipped.  Unlike the real life corporate scandals, in this case the Chief Financial Officer gets whacked.  Suspicion points in various directions.<br />There is the usual cast of characters, with Hawk and Vinnie lending helping hands, friends with the police, Spenser's girlfriend Susan and the dog they share, and various other characters that show up, some new and some old.  The killers are caught, but some guilty parties seem to walk away.  There is a major loose end as the corporation seems to be left in limbo.<br />My oldest niece would call the novel brain candy.  It is light reading for a rainy evening, a weekend at the beach, a long commute or an airline flight.  It contains some details for setting up shell companies and creating ficticious assets.  The novel contains language (mainly the F word in its various forms), implied sexual activity, and a couple murders, but nothing graphic.  I would rate it at about the PG-13 level.	2004-03-28

While the main action takes place in less than a week, there are flashbacks to earlier events related to a double murder in the past.  Young men who have mental problems related to the past events form a group of urban terrorists.  There actions at first seem like unconnected pranks until people start getting killed.  When a police officer is kidnapped, and demands are made, their real purpose becomes evident.<br />While the story is a stand-alone plot, it continues with characters from previous novels, primarily news reporter Irene Kelly.  Various information emerges about people's pasts.  Some people have hidden problems that cause bad dreams.<br />The setting for the novel is somewhat before the present so, while there is electronic technology, technology is not quite up to 2004 standards (cell phones but no caller ID).  One can wonder about a police officer and news reporter being able to afford a beachfront home in California, but perhaps it was purchased at some time in the distant past (or maybe they got incredibly lucky with investments).<br />Overall, a good cops and robbers type story involving police, news reporters, and deranged killers.  There is a short epilogue to wrap up a few loose ends.	2004-03-27

It is a good first novel written by a younger novelist.  While the writing style may not be great literature, the plot is very original, and the writing is very good (the author is a journalist by trade).  The hardbound copy is in a somewhat smaller format, with an easy to read type font.  The story moves along, and with 209 pages of actual text is easy to read in an evening.  It is small enough to easily fit into a carryon bag to take along on an airline flight or to the beach.<br />The story brings together an interesting group of people, but I do know people like this.  Would a band of bikers help out in real life?  Well, yes.  They might get rowdy at times, but I have found they are trustworthy and will stand behind their friends.  The outlaw image is misleading.<br />Reporters and photographers risking their lives for a story?  Sure, they do that somewhere every day, and sometimes they get shot.  Some survive and some don't.  The government giving tacit support to weapons sales?  Well, look at recent history.<br />Overall a good story.  The novel has been largely overlooked by most readers.	2004-03-25

Books	3	0	1	N	Y	An average adventure novel	This is a self-published novel with an interesting plot.  It is the usual tale of &quot;civilized&quot; adventurers trying to steal treasures from a native temple.  For some reason, people who would think it was a vile crime to steal from a church, thought it was OK to steal treasures from &quot;heathen&quot; natives.  It seemed to be a common 16th century attitude that carried over to the 20th century.<br />While the plot is interesting, the writing style did not hold my attention.  It is perhaps a little too Bogartish, e.g., the Maltese Falcon, with far too much slang thrown in.<br />The plot is set in 1952 in the islands off the northwest coast of New Guinea.  Various people are trying to steal rare silver coins in the possession of local native headhunters.  The people seem a little inept, but who ever said that amateur thieves were smart.  It should be noted that New Guinea natives were known to have hoards of coins (usually buried in pots of rancid pig fat), and smart traders found things the natives wanted to buy with their coins.<br />For a real tale of double dealing in rare coins, one can read the account of events leading up to the last sale of a 1933 gold double eagle, also a coin produced illegally by one of more mint employees with an unknown number floating around in private collections.	2004-03-20

It was not uncommon to kill uncles, nephews, brothers, cousins, fathers or sons.  Sad to say, many of those people were my ancestors.  In this novel, a rogue politician wants to be president.  With the aid of two brothers, he has their father drugged and confined to a nursing home in order to gain control of family wealth.  With the aid of a son working for the CIA, he uses intelligence assets, bribery and blackmail to gain access to or create criminal records for his political opponent.  He causes the murder of a sister, and is willing to sacrifice a niece.  People will betray their country, their friends, and their families if offerred the right incentives.<br />The main plot covers a short time period leading up to the presidential election in the United States.  The story is fast paced, and the novel is hard to put down once you get involved in the plot.  There are lots of people with guns, and some collateral damage.  The advantage shifts back and forth between good guys and bad guys, but the good guys have some unexpected allies, and sometimes there is a &quot;falling out among thieves.&quot;<br />There is a final wrap-up set a year later.<br />There are some technical explanations of both psychological loss of senses (in this case sight), and of the heightened senses some people develop.  This last point was interesting as I have always been able to sense people behind me, but did not know how to account for that ability.	2004-03-15

The author has written it as a stand alone novel, but characters carry over from the previous novel.  Readers might want to read the novels in order, although explanations of previous action are included in the plot.<br />The Carnivore, an international assassin for hire, had provided information to U.S. intelligence in exchange for sanctuary for his wife.  Now it appears that all the information was not revealed, and a file exists somewhere.  A secret group of international business and government leaders, calling themselves the Coil, want the file.  A deadly blackmailer apparently has the file and is using it for his own purposes.<br />Liz Sansborough, ex-CIA agent and daughter of the Carnivore, finds herself caught in the middle, with the blackmailer trying to have her killed and The Coil trying to use her for bait to lure the blackmailer into the open.  Her look-alike cousin and the cousin's wife are drawn into the plot.  There are a series of captures and excapes as the advantage shifts from one side to the other.<br />The plot winds down to a final confrontation.

I considered it a safe city for walking around, so it was interesting to read a novel about the underside of the city.  This is generally a good novel, but the criminals seem a little inept and do improbable things to call attention to themselves.  There may be a few too many subplots which can create excess baggage to the main plot, especially when the plot is compressed into a time schedule of about a week.<br />The main plot concerns the shooting of three students at a private school and the suicide of the alleged gunman.  Two of the students are killed by shots through the head.  The third is wounded and is the only witness.  It appears a cut and dried case of a murder-suicide by an intruder into the school, but their are questions about motive.  The intruder is a former member of the Special Air Service (SAS), and the appearance of two military investigators compounds matters.  What are they looking for?  There are questions of Post Combat Stress Syndrome.<br />There is a subplot about charges against DI John Rebus, accused of arson and murder.  There is a subplot concerning drug smuggling (by some individuals who do dumb things, but criminals often get caught tripping over their own feet).  There is a subplot about teenage gangs.  Matters are brought up about John's relatives, and incidents in his past life including his military service.  Various strange characters wander through the plot.  As the plot progresses, events tie together various people and events.<br />The Epilogue raises the question of whether well placed people can be convicted of crimes, especially when they have the funds to hire top-of-the-line legal assistance.	2004-03-11

The first part covers about a year's time to establish the situation.  Then the main part of the novel spans about a one week time period as events unfold.  The Epilogue covers about a one year period as follow on to the main plot and wraps up some loose ends.<br />After the collapse of the communist government, a new elite seized power of the country's resources.  People are ruthless, willing to kill opponents, and unemployed assassins from the old KGB are available.  A group is maneuvering to take control of the Russian government, and it includes Russians within the United States.  There is a mole somewhere within the FBI providing information known only to top level officials.<br />Beth Convey has received a heart transplant, and finds herself with strange compulsions that seem to be related to the donor.<br />She finds herself drawn into intrigue surrounding Russian businessmen located in the Washington, DC, metro area.  There are more players in the game than people realize, and some of them are deadly.  It reminds me of the lines from an old nursery rhyme, &quot;Who is watching the watchbird, while the watchbird is watching you.&quot;<br />You can guess about the identity of the mole, but my guess was wrong.  As I noted in a previous review, in the intelligence business you can't trust anyone.  People have different motives, but most often it is money, i.e., personal greed.<br />As the story winds towards a conclusion, help comes from some unexpected sources.  There is collateral damage, and one can wonder about some of the minor players who undoubtedly had their lives changed forever.	2004-02-29

In this novel, there is a lot of double dealing and, in some cases, the people don't always know who they are dealing with.<br />A group of people handling large sums of untraceable money find they can siphon some off into their own accounts, and use their assets to give themselves an edge in business dealings.  People are assassinated for the convenience of the agents, and various crimes (including murder) are committed in the United States.  A senior official in the CIA uses his position to recruit homicidal people with no morals who will follow his directions without question.<br />A trail of dead bodies are left strewn about the landscape.  Some people are elimated because they know to much, and some just get in the way.<br />An international assassin wants to come in from the cold.  He makes the mistake of contacting U.S. intelligence.  Some people want to offer immunity in exchange for what he knows, but other people want him dead because he knows secrets they want to keep buried.  He might disrupt the plans of a person preparing to make a large financial killing, a person prepared to eliminate confederates and subordinates in order to cover his tracks.<br />Some elements of the plot have been used before, e.g., drugging someone to make them follow your commands, but overall the plot is very original and has some interesting action and some twists in the tale.  It is difficult to put the book down as you follow the story to the end.	2004-02-25

He who has the sand has the tourist trade.<br />There is the mysterious Flynn, a stranger who has appeared on the island and seems to be helping people in her village.  Everyone seems to have their own agenda, whether it is competition for a pretty young woman, or for getting the better of a business rival.  Everyone is not who they seem.  As the story progresses, various information comes to the surface and hidden secrets are revealed.<br />This is the story of people fighting to survive, whether the problems come from harsh weather, invading jellyfish, oil spills, or the greed of other individuals.  Some younger people leave to look for a better life, but some return, drawn back to their beginnings.  Overall, it is an interesting story.	2004-02-23

It will do as a reference whether you are writing about feisty feists, the seizure of counterfeit sovereigns, the science of glaciers, or seismic effects on gneiss.  It covers both spellings and both pronunciations of sheikh, and includes words with similar pronunciations such as cay, key, and quay. It has sufficient coverage to include place names such as Aqaba. It has the usual deficiency of dictionaries in this size range, i.e., it does not include lesser known place names such as Sequim, Kalaloch, and Quilcene.	2004-02-14

It goes into minute details about the everyday life of the Typee.  At times I felt a bit glassy eyed and skimmed forward over some sections.<br />Melville comes across a bit dense and self centered, and obviously applied a double standard, one for whites and one for natives.  After toying with the affections of a young native woman, he casually abandons her and does not seem to understand why her family would object.  Perhaps he would have had a better understanding if he was abandoning the daughter of a prominant politician in New England.<br />He was somewhat a nosy Parker, inserting himself in situations where he was not wanted, and showing little regard for the customs of the Typee.  Overall, it is an interesting account of life among the natives.	2004-02-12

It also deals with autopsies and the smell of death.  Not for the faint at heart.<br />There is collateral damage as the plot develops.  If you are looking for a novel where the main villain is punished you will be disappointed.  Some characters get more than they deserve as punishment for misdeeds, and some go unpunished.<br />This is a complex plot, dealing with topics ranging from pedophilia to stolen identities.  It makes you wonder if you really know the people around you.  It also explains why many police officers drink, some heavily, considering what they must deal with in the course of investigations, and why they may be inclined to get a bit rough on the assumption that the suspect must be guilty of something.<br />The plot is a little unfinished as some people seem to just drop out of sight.  In the words of Shakespeare, some people vanish into thin air.  One can wonder what happened to Mark.	2004-02-04

Besides the missing children, there is the rain and flood, problems within Chief Inspector Wexford's own family, and sometimes long descriptions of passing scenery, what people are eating for lunch, etc.  Then there are all the long-winded people who can't seem to get to the point.  Wexford gets frustrated with people, but a reader can get frustrated wanted to get on with the plot.<br />Eventually the story gets moving along, but the reader can guess some of the circumstances of the plot.  The full circumstances are not known until the end, but come only partly as a surprise.  It deals with perhaps too many issues including adolescent sex, pedophilia, fundamentalist religion, spousal abuse, phychological abuse, social climbing, family conflicts, and misplaced loyalties.  Authors should be careful about getting on a soapbox.	2004-02-04

As a result, it skips about quite a bit in location and time before getting to the final plot.  In between, the author provides essays on various portions of history ranging from Bosnia to Vietnam.  I found myself skimming some parts to get on with the story.<br />The Avenger comes across as an A-Team of one, although he has support from various sources.  A former Tunnel Rat in Vietnam, he is smart, cunning, in excellent physical condition (he trains for the triathalon), and is willing to kill (although he usually does not).  Lots of money from his client, and good contacts (both legal and illegal), allow him many options and identities, although someone knows his true name.<br />Considering the amount of effort expended in developing the varuous characters in the novel, one expects that the author is planning a sequel.	2004-01-30

As in Forester's novel, they take decisive action to turn the tide.<br />Like other novels in the series, it is based on real events.<br />After having Sharpe settle in France with his mistress, the author steps back in time to fill in a part of Sharpe's career, in this case in northern Portugal in 1809.  It is based on the French capture of Oporto, and Marshal Soult's defeat by General Wellesley and his retreat back out of Portugal.<br />The novel has a significant amount of blood and gore, including details of pillage, rape, and murder of civilians (based on content, I would give it a PG-13 rating).  It illustrates the pig-headed type of military commander who expends men by assaulting enemy strongpoints rather than relying on strategy, bypassing strongpoints, and cutting off enemy supply lines.  Perhaps it illustrates the historic problem of officers rising to general through influence rather than ability.  There is also the double dealing Christopher from the Foreign Office, who tries to play both sides of the game.<br />Sharpe again meets Lord Pumphrey of the Foreign Office, a somewhat shady individual who eliminates people who might know too much.  Lord Pumphrey considers Christoper a problem, and sends Sharpe to deal with the problem.  As in Denmark, it is convenient for the Foreign Office to have a murderous rogue like Sharpe available.  There are some tasks that could not be assigned to a well-bred gentleman.	2004-01-24
814393:US	52705209	R3GA29I38FDEG1	0060530499	675859556	Heretic (The Grail Quest, Book 3)	Books	5	4	5	N	Y	3rd book in the series	Set in 14th century France, where the peasants trying to survive were beset by greedy barons exacting rent and taxes, invading armies that pillaged and burned villages, a corrupt church, bands of unemployed soldiers who occupied areas for their own profit, gangs of bandits who preyed on everyone else, and the plague which appeared and decimated entire towns. Thomas of Hookton returns to France during the last stages of the seige of Calais.  He reports to the Earl of Northampton, and leaves on a search for the Holy Grail.<br />It is an interesting tale, and does raise a question.  How would you recognize the Grail if you happened to find it?  It was a cup, but there were hundreds of thousands of cups lying about.  The quest is joined by various people who have their own interests in finding the Grail, some for personal profit, and some for power.  Friendships are uncertain, and people sometimes form unlikely alliances (an enemy of my enemy is my friend).  The main criteria for being a hero seems to be the ability to survive, and Thomas survives unusual perils while people around him perish.<br />The novel has an interesting epilogue about the Grail.  Readers are referred to Mercedes Lackey's short story \\"Once and Future\\" about a man who wakes up one morning to find himself in possession of Excalibur (it is found in her collection, \\"Fiddler Fair\\").  Possibly of interest is the fact that Thomas finds a woman companion who also survives.  The author has a habit of disposing of women in his novels, although Sharpe also eventually settled down with a woman who seems to survive.<br />I originally became interested in the series because the Earl of Northampton was a distant ancestor.  The author has done extensive research into the history of time period, and his novels seem a good depiction of conditions.	2004-01-23

It is a 53 page story plus some white pages, introduction, etc.  The price may seem a bit high, but it was republished for a fundraising effort after some rewriting.  The original was a limited edition publication provided as a free promotional item for a bookstore.<br />This is a short action (skirmish) set between the time periods of two of the novels in the Sharpe series.  The time is 1812.  The French are retreating from Spain.  The British are advancing in Northwest Spain after the Battle of Salamanca, and Sharpe is given the task of guarding a small fort on the flank of the British supply lines.  All is well until the French decide to make a surprise attack.  The final defense of the bridge somewhat brings to mind Harclay's defense at Boroughbridge in 1322, except Harclay had longbows.  It is difficult to charge on horseback over a defended bridge.	2004-01-21

Like Sharpe's Skirmish, this volume contains stories that were rewritten and republished as a fundraising effort.  The price is somewhat high, but consider it a contribution to a worthwhile cause.  They were originally published as Christmas stories in the &quot;Daily Mail.&quot;  The stories are very good, the first taking place on Christmas 1813 on the border between France and Spain.  The second takes place in Normandy on a Christmas Eve following Waterloo.<br />While the first story deals with military action against the French, and Sharp meets an old acquaintance from India, the second deals with the conditions in France following the war, when unemployed soldiers became marauders.  Sharp deals with an old enemy that he previously allowed to live, and finally settles in, at least for a time, on a farm in Normandy.<br />In a way, the second story deals with the question of disbanding armies after a war that lasted over 20 years.  What do men do when they no longer have military employment?	2004-01-21

He finds himself the victim of blackmail by a vicous hoodlum.  It is like being trapped in a bog, the more he struggles to get out, the deeper he sinks in.  He discovers various circumstances and people are not what they seemed to be, and others are quite willing to use him as a goat.<br />I remember a pet cat we had when I was a child.  It was tame until a neighbor's dog backed it into a corner, and it slashed the dog across the nose with its claws.  People have Charles backed against the wall when he taps primal instincts to save himself (aided by the chance actions of someone else).  He does have a creative mind - after all, he works in advertising.<br />The story starts out near the end, and then works forward, as he reveals his past, the problems, and his solutions.  I won't reveal the details and the surprise ending, but it is worth reading.  It is written in the first person, sometimes narrative, and sometimes with dialogue.	2004-01-17

The novel is divided into three parts, involving three actions on Plattner's World (although the last part has a fourth action).  It should be noted that the novel was published before the invasion of Iraq - readers might find some parts interesting considering events related to that invasion.  I had some problems with the writing style.  Some sentences seem awkward (I had to go back and reread to understand what I was reading) and the author sometimes writes with an echo, repeating information previously given to the reader, i.e., how many times do we need to know about a man's injuries which caused him to be reassigned to a logistics unit?  Under UNESCO standards, 49 pages qualifies as a book.  The novel has 358 pages (hardbound edition), and some of the writing could qualify as excess baggage.<br />This novel is a case of history repeating itself.  When politics and diplomacy fail, greed causes various factions to hire mercenaries and mortgage their futures for little or no gain.  It makes one think of the War of 1812, where both sides lost heavily, and neither side ended up with much to show for it.  In this case, a dispute over tariff fees, and neither side willing to compromise, leads to a costly war.  There are the usual anti-war factions, trade being routed through third parties, outside interests becoming involved, foreign agents, and double dealing.<br />It should be noted that Colonel Hammer never trusts anyone, especially people he is working for, but he always honors his contracts.  He may do serious damage to the countryside in the process.  You most certainly do not want to get on his wrong side as he might have you shot.	2004-01-12

It won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1965.  The Klan burned a cross on the author's front lawn after it was published.  There is always some truth in fiction, as indicated by the recent revelations about a late U.S. Senator from a southern state, and the discussions about the mistress of President Thomas Jefferson.<br /><br />A prominant white widower, during times of racial segregation, has an affair with a black housekeeper producing three children who are raised with his grand-daughter until they are old enough to send to private boarding schools in the north.  He provides for them financially, but does not acknowledge them publicly, although it is well known among the family and others.<br /><br />His grand-daughter marries a man with political aspirations who joins the Klan to further his career.  Things go along fine, but the truth will out.  People seeking vengence of whatever kind forget where their fortunes lie.  And people should remember who owns the county and who pays the bills before throwing stones.	2004-01-07

The title is the name of a pub that plays a small role in the story.  The novel starts out well, but then the author makes a side trip to Long Piddleton and introduces material that is unconnected to the main plot.  A couple of the characters from Long Piddleton eventually have roles in the main plot.  The author has a fixation on piddling, and the characters include Flash, who exposes himself in public loos, and a child who piddles here, there, and everywhere, none of which is relevant to the main plot, although the people are related to one of the characters.  Various odd characters wander in and out of the story, some related to the plot, and some just extra baggage along for the ride.<br />The main plot is interesting as New Scotland Yard tries to get to the truth of the matter.  This is not an easy task as there is a tendency to not believe people telling the truth, and to believe people who are not.  There is collateral damage, and a few bodies are left lying about.  There is grand larceny and murder, and connections to crimes in other countries.<br />If you expect the villain (a cold blooded psychopath) to be brought to justice, you will be disappointed.  Who is real and who is not?  People can fade into the night or, in the words of Shakespeare, \\"...are melted into air, into thin air...\\"	2004-01-04

Most of the settings are in small towns in Mississippi, apparently during the 1930s, although one story seems to be set in New York City.  Most of the inter-city transportaion was by train, people had radios (if they had electricity), roads were unimproved, and many people were scratching to get by.<br /><br />The stories in the book range from humorous to somewhat surrealistic.  Most have dialogue between characters, but others seem to be narrative accounts.  As in most collections, readers will like some stories better than others.  Readers should be aware that the stories reflect social structure and language of the time period, e.g., some stories use the N word.<br />Some readers may find some of the stories offensive.<br /><br />I particularly liked stories like \\"The Petrified Man,\\" which is set in a beauty salon and could be used for a short stage play.  It should be noted that Katherine Anne Porter wrote the introduction to this collection of short stories.	2003-12-31

In this case, the pub is in the opening scene, then disappears from the plot.  Like the novels of Dick Francis, this one involves racing.<br />The plot, perhaps, is a little too complicated, with a few too many characters but some surprising twists.  Like the Dick Francis novels, you learn a lot about racing - in this case stud farms.  It is a lose girl, find girl, lose girl again type plot.  It takes a few chapters to develop the plot.  While you think you may have guilty parties identified, the final conclusion is not obvious.<br />Richard Jury and Melrose Plant are involved in the investigation, and there are digressions into the affairs of Long Piddleton.  Melrose acquires a horse and a resident hermit.  One of the problems with the novel is that the author cannot seem to stay on a single track.  It is an interesting novel, but too many digressions can make a story drag.	2003-12-29

Cherryh, et al.), but with some new characters and situations.  The setting has been moved to 16th century Venice, although in an alternate timeline where the Library at Alexandria was saved, and where magic exists along with demons.  People are caught up in political struggles between rival empires, city states, and rival families, with vendettas and assassinations being common.  All of that is complicated by demons from the underworld trying to take control and feed on people's souls.<br />The setting is not entirely clear at the beginning, and it is necessary to read a few chapters to get a clear picture of the situation.  After that, the story becomes more interesting.  It was easy to set aside while reading the early chapters, but I stayed up late to finish the book when I reached the final chapers.  Overall, an interesting story.	2003-12-13

It is mainly written in the third person in a documentary fashion, with some sections of dialog.  It will appeal more to people interested in the history of the era than to people just looking for a novel.<br />(...)  The novel covers the details of the American pre-war objections to English policies, and the problems with government officials operating far from the mother country (people familiar with \\"law west of the Pecos\\" will understand this).(...)<br />This novel provides a different perspective of the war using a fictional family that is trying to survive during difficult times.  It gives a good picture of the different segments of society ranging from subsistence farmers to plantation owners and merchants.  The differences in attitudes between the people on the eastern seaboard and in the western uplands is also covered in \\"Cold Mountain\\" in a Civil War setting.	2003-12-01

In particular, the last story refers back to the first.  The stories are of varying length.  &quot;The Finder&quot; is a 106 page novelette.  &quot;Darkrose and Diamond&quot; is 35 pages.  &quot;The Bones of the Earth&quot; is 20 pages.  &quot;On the High Marsh&quot; is 33 pages.  The last story, &quot;Dragonfly&quot; is 69 pages long.  The author ends the collection with a 30 page description of Earthsea.  The stories are about wizards and witches, good and evil, and involve shape changing, healing magic, finding, fire starting, binding spells, weather magic, etc.  Like most collections, everyone will have their favorites, liking some stories better than others.  I disagree with the author's statement that you should read her other novels first (the author, of course, is interested in selling copies).  This collection stands well on its own.	2003-11-08

I would suggest that the previous reviewer should re-read the last chapter.  There are a number of interwoven plots.  There is Mary Jago, escaping from an abusive boyfriend, who thinks she has found a new love; Roman, victim of a tragedy, who has dropped out of life to sleep on the streets; Bean, a 70-year old ex-butler to a man who liked to be beaten, who now works as a dog walker to supplement his small pension; Hob, a druggy who earns a living as an enforcer for drug dealers; Detective Inspector Marnock, who investigates various murders that are committed; an unknown impaler who is killing street people; and an assortment of other characters plus a large number of dogs.  Some people like dogs and some people don't, but be careful how you treat them because they have friends who may take revenge in unexpected ways.<br />The setting is the Regent Park area of London.  The gates are closed at night except to residents who have keys, but various other people find their way past the gates.  Several people are murdered and their bodies impaled on spiked fences, but that is just one of the plots.  There is drug dealing, blackmail, muggings, and there is Mary Jago trying to escape from her ex-boyfriend and find a new life.<br />The plot takes some surprising twists and turns.  Some people get what they deserve, but the abusive ex-boyfriend seems to walk away unscathed (except that he lost his chance with a rich heiress).  Perhaps Marnock should have named the killer on the last page instead of making readers figure it out from the clues given, but that means you have to read the book carefully.	2003-10-08

The setting is greater Hollywood during the late 1950s, a time when I briefly lived in the area (in Hollywood, the Snake Pit in North Hollywood, and in Burbank).  The writing is in a narrative form by the main character, Fleur, and covers a pre-teen period from the time she is 10 to the time she is 12.  The chapters are incidents in Fleur's life relating to different people around her.  The main problem is that people keep moving away, and there is no stability in her life.  It provides an interesting picture of a child of career parents, largely neglected, and growing up in a partly child and partly adult environment.<br />The dustjacket cover seems to have little to do with the contents, and the title may be a little misleading (although everyone seems to steal, whether it is stories, identities, boyfriends, or material objects).  The book comes to an ending of sorts, but one has to wonder if it is intended to lead into a sequel.	2003-09-26

The type style and formatting make it easily readable.  It is the story of a young girl, Lillian, who lives with her aunt at the edge of the forest, far from the nearest neighbors.  She spends her free time wandering in the woods looking for fairies.  When disaster strikes, she is saved by cat magic.  This is an original fairy tale, and seems a mixture of folklore and magic.  It can be read to younger children, or read by slightly older children.  I would put the age level at 4 to 12, although I am 67 and thought it was an interesting tale (I actually bought it to use as a gift for a young child).	2003-09-26

The plot skips forward in time from chapter to chapter, and skips between people in various sub-plots.  It does seem to have a main character, more or less, but often is dealing with someone else.  It seems to be left unfinished to lead into a sequel.  The writing seems to be soap opera style.<br />The story is about competition to control the mineral wealth in the asteroids, a lawless frontier where competition can get deadly.  Everyone has their own agenda.  Like in real life, most prospectors die broke.  The money is made by companies selling them supplies.<br />It is hard to find white hats in the story, as everyone involved seems willing to kill to achieve their goals.	2003-09-24

As the author notes, 11 of the stories are based on real incidents.  I personally found the stories to be entertaining (Jeffrey Archer is one of my favorite authors).

It is another collection that I refer to commuters, airline travelers, etc., who are looking for some light reading.  The stories, as the collection title implies, have some interesting twists.	2003-09-19

The Civil War is being fought in the United States while life goes on as usual in England.  The situation described in the novel was usual for that time period, and is similar to the real circumstances that prevailed in my hometown, at that time a notorious sailing port in the U.S., during the later 19th century - a reformer trying to clean up the town soon discovered that most of the &quot;good citizens&quot; were getting their share of the pie, the prostitutes paid in cash and were a mainstay of the town's economy (see &quot;Port Townsend - An Illustrated History of Shanghaiing, Shipwrecks, Soiled Doves, and Sundry Souls&quot;).<br />Hester Monk (who had been a nurse in the Crimea) operates an infirmary in a lower class neighborhood, offering medical services to the ladies of the evening who are suffering from injuries and diseases.  Her husband, William Monk, is involved in an investigation of possible financial wrongdoing among the principals of a railroad company.  The death of a &quot;respectable&quot; man outside a bordello in the area creates a turmoil and eventually events are drawn together.<br />Circumstances reveal a brutal form of loan sharking.  William's investigation brings out information about his past - he was not always a nice person.  Past relationships are revealed as the case draws to a conclusion.  Overall, an interesting plot, with a good picture of the underside of Victorian London.	2003-09-19

From there the story progresses to the main plot about a serial killer with a strange compulsion.  Tess and a new found associate link together a number of seemingly unrelated homicides, including a disappearance and an &quot;accidental&quot; death from the distant past.  Details of her own past emerge, partly from discussions with a psychiatrist she is seeing as part of a plea bargain agreement.<br />Tess still has her boyfriend, Crow, and her two dogs, but they play minor roles.  She bumbles about a bit, and almost gets herself killed in the manner of independent investigators created by various authors.  There are some side details of Baltimore, Maryland's eastern shore, etc., and a view of some of the sleazy underside of life.	2003-09-14

Jimbo majored in football at Mississippi State University where he was a starting lineman.  After drinking tequila shooters, Jimbo has a way of picking fights, e.g., going into a redneck bar filled with Univ. of Alabama fans and criticizing Bear Bryant's trademark hat (\\"What French Quarter queer joint you reckon he was cruising when he found that...\\").  The next morning he can't remember the brawl, doesn't know why he has a sore foot and mud all over his pickup, and he has a massive hangover.<br />The story then flashes back to the start when Jack was hired by a woman to determine why her daughter, along with three other young people, was murdered in a summer cabin on Dauphine Island.  Matters are complicated when Jack's ex-wife runs her mouth about Jack's case.  She only told her friend on Dauphine Island, but that was like telling the tabloids.  Jack receives a death threat before he half begins his inquiries.  The 220 pages following Chapter One are divided into 26 additional chapters.<br />The case involves possible smuggling, sports betting, environmental fanatics, various local watering holes with hard-drinking pool-playing rednecks, and assorted women (Jimbo is usually on the prowl).  The reader learns various details about Jack's past life, and his incompatibility with his ex-wife - their preferred lifestyles are a mismatch (he was from a family of shrimpers and boat builders and played baseball at Ole Miss, she was a Rebelette from a cotton-planting banking family in higher society).  Jack's ex- is jealous of the new women in his life, particularly if they have a bigger bust than she has.<br />The novel has an interesting plot, and contains helpful maps of Dauphine Island and the Mobile County, Alabama area.  It will probably be of particular interest to people familiar with the Gulf Coast.	2003-03-14
1201509:US	52705209	R2UKZA65ASN51S	0451410025	962047318	I Am the Only Running Footman (Richard Jury Mystery)	Books	3	22	25	N	N	Another Richard Jury novel	This is a reprint of a novel copyrighted in 1986.  As in other novels by this author, the title is the name of a pub.  Inspector Jury is joined again by Melrose Plant who has an estate near Long Piddleton on the River Piddle.  In this novel, Jury is assigned to a case where a young woman has been strangled with her own scarf.  The investigation reopens an older, unsolved case where another young woman was also strangled with her own scarf.  Inquiries into the pasts of the two women turn up love affairs that may be related - both women were sleeping around to some degree.<br />The questions are whether these are serial killings or well-planned murders, and what would be the motive.  Various odd characters are introduced including the odd family that owns and operates the Mortal Man.  While the plot is interesting, digressions into discussions of the various characters (many not involved in the main plot) tends to detract from the main story line.  At times, the story seems to wander.<br />When events are finally drawn together, it seems a bit abrupt.  The story comes to a climax as the solution to the mystery is revealed, but it seems to leave some loose ends.  A short added chapter might have closed things out better.  One is left to wonder what finally happened to some of the characters.	2003-03-08

The author starts with a man being released from prison somewhere, at some point in time, and then skips forward to Majorca at another point in time with different people.  The author apparently knows where and when he is - it would be nice if he shared that information with his readers.  Other authors put dates and places at the chapter headings.<br />Inspector Alvarez finds himself involved with another murder.  This time it is a former diplomat who is not particularly well liked, and who may have been involved in drug dealing.  A number of people had reasons to kill him.  As the story winds to a conclusion, it finally draws together the loose ends.<br />The part of the plot about the auto accident is not entirely original (see Martha Grimes earlier novel, \\"I am the Only Running Footman\\"), but a variation has been used.  Alvarez is his usual indolent self, drinking too much and looking forward to fine dining.  Dolores shows she can use methods of her own when her family is threatened.	2003-03-08
1203868:US	52705209	R2YJCCPDPSBK5N	B00006RGI7	926968574	Long Time No See	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Another amateur detective	Some years ago an acquaintance related his experience digging for placer gold on a mining claim.  He had to remove tons of material to find the seam of gold bearing gravel.  The author of this novel has loaded it with an infinite amount of material about this, that, and the other thing; degressions into the main character's personal life; flashbacks to incidents in a previous novel; and comments on older men.  Somewhere, buried under all that, is a plot.  If you are interested in the details of life in Yuppyville, you might like the novel.<br />The plot includes missing people, missing money, insider trading, false identities, computer data searches, etc.  The action starts out somewhat slowly, but the pace picks up as the story progresses.  I fast-forwarded through the initial chapters, skipping most of one chapter.  The plot was a little transparent as I had the guilty party identified a quarter of the way through the novel.  Various elements of the plot have been used before by other authors.<br />Overall, the novel is about average. It is something to read on a rainy day.  Based on content, I would rate the novel at the PG-13 level.	2003-03-06

He has set this novel's plot on the modern Mississippi Gulf Coast where private investigator Jack Delmas, a native of the area, finds himself between a declining shrimping industry and a booming tourist industry with luxury hotels and casinos.  there are wheelers and dealers, corrupt politicians, shrimp fishermen, and businessmen ranging from a shade-tree mechanic to a successful restaurateur.  The novel presents a good picture of an area in transition where most people want a piece of the pie, but some people would rather be beach bums.  The novel contains lots of local color about the area.<br />When Jack's longtime friend, the Croatian shrimper Casper Perinovich, dies in an explosion and fire at his home, Jack is drawn into the investigation and stirs up things people would prefer to keep buried.  The story has considerable action, and Jack sustains some damage to his person and his pickup (messing with a southern boy's pickup can be as bad as messing with his woman).  Along the way, Jack rekindles an old flame.<br />This is a good novel for commuters as the 272 pages are divided into 41 chapters.	2003-03-01

It is a fictional story of a serial killer.  It is not for the faint at heart.  The killer has invaded an adult Internet forum to search for his victims.  He is obsessed and wants to be a God.  It becomes a deadly game of wits between the killer, the company's sysops, and the police.  Victims are mutilated and it becomes clear that the killer is harvesting a body part.<br />The sysops' personal lives are dragged into the investigation, and their own dark secrets come to the surface as they attempt to trap the killer.  In some respects they are not overly bright (looking through a glass window when you expect something inside to explode?  Isn't that a little numb-brained?)<br />The novel is a little long because of long conversations between characters.  The white hats win, more or less, but there is a lot of collateral damage.  It has strong sexual content and violence.  I would give it an R rating.	2003-02-23

The novel introduces Detective Chief Inspector Richard Jury who has been sent to investigate murders in the village of Long Piddleton on the River Piddle (the British do have quaint place names).  A string of murders during the Christmas season seem unrelated until the investigation draws them together.<br />A number of people in the village have events in their pasts that bring them under suspicion.  Unlike most English mysteries, this one has a villain with a gun.  The investigation reveals a few surprises as it draws to a conclusion.<br />The novel has implied sexual content and some amount of violence.  It is at about the PG-13 level.	2003-02-17

Joe Kurtz, former private investigator, has just been released after serving 11 years in prison at Attica for brutally murdering a man who raped and killed his girlfriend.  He learned to use computers while in prison and is now setting up a legitimate investigative service.<br />Joe met the son of a mafia don while he was in prison.  Now the family has secretly hired him to find out what happened to their accountant, and who is hijacking their trucks.  Joe finds himself confronting enemies, both known and unknown, including friends and families of people he had previously killed plus a police officer who would like to send him back to prison.  There are double crosses and a triple cross.<br />The novel has language, graphic sexual content, and a large amount of violence including shootings, stabbings, throwing people from heights, and setting one person on fire.  Some cases of violence and injuries are overly descriptive.  The story is R rated if not X rated.	2003-01-31

Cordelia is now settled in, and taking cases as an independent private investigator in London.  She is hired to investigate threatening letters being received by an actress.  The initial chapters in the novel introduce the various characters involved in the story.  They are brought together at a restored Victorian castle on an island, the main purpose being the appearance of the actress in a theatrical production.<br />The case becomes complex as different subplots wind together.  Someone is guilty of murder, but who.  All is not what it seems, as details of different relationships are revealed.  The case does not actually come to an end.  Cordelia learns the details of crimes, but can anything be proved in court?  A guilty party has privately admitted guilt, tries to murder Cordelia, and challenges her to prove it.  There the story ends.<br />This novel, published in 1982, would seem to lead into a sequel, but I have found no other novels by the author that deal with Cordelia.	2003-01-30

The events included describe Cochrane's activities when he commanded the Speedy from 1800-1801 (see &quot;the Autobiography of a Seaman,&quot; by Admiral Lord Cochrane, republished in 2000 by Lyons Press).  O'Brien has replaced Cochrane with the fictional James Aubrey, giving him a similar personality.  While O'Brien has given more color to the story, there is absolutely nothing significant that is original to the plot.  I have to agree with a recent reviewer that the novel describes a lot of action without having a central plot.  The second book in the series, &quot;Post Captain,&quot; seems to be a more original story, but many of O'Brien's novels seem to have taken significant amounts of material from earlier writers (without acknowledging that fact).	2003-01-27

Richard Woodman has added an introduction to the present edition.  Cochrane only covers the period of his life up through 1814 when he was 39.  Consequently, he covers nothing of his later career in Chile, Brazil, and Greece; nothing of his reinstatement in the Royal Navy; and nothing of his immediate family other than a brief account of his marriage to Kitty Barnes (about 20 years younger than Cochrane) by whom he had 5 children.<br />Autobiographers always have a bias as the authors are presenting their side of the case (see, for example, Bligh's \\"Mutiny Aboard the H.M.S. Bounty\\").  While presenting the details of his early naval career, the main thrust is his campaign against corruption in the Admiralty Courts, the Royal Navy, and the Government in general.  Some accounts are almost like comic opera, e.g., the Admiralty Court in Malta.<br />Cochrane's service commanding the Speedy from 1800 to 1801 has been fictionalized by Patrick O'Brien in the novel \\"Master and Commander\\" in which he replaces Cochrane with the fictional James Aubrey.  All the major details are the same, but O'Brien added considerable color to the account.<br />Like many good military commanders, Cochrane lacked tact and was not a diplomat.  He was promoted to command the Speedy at the age of 25 without having the experience to deal with the protocols of the Royal Navy.  He could best be described as a loose cannon.  He was unwilling to compromise when a little tact, a closed mouth, and a small amount of back scratching would have achieved major results.  His lack of diplomacy caused others to reject well thought out plans simply because he proposed them.  Cochrane damaged others around him simply by trying to be their champion, undoubtedly being responsible for Parker's ruin - people in power who Cochrane had offended would naturally take it out on his proteges.<br />While not great literature, the autobiography is both a good account of naval service from 1793 to 1809, and a good first-hand account of corruption within politics and the government.  The writing style is somewhat like Churchill's history of World War II.t literature, the autobiography is both a good account of naval service from 1793 to 1809, and a good first-hand account of corruption within politics and the government.

The book possibly gets a little heavy into the position of women in society, etc., but otherwise is a good mystery.  Charles Voisey was thwarted in his attempt to seize the government, but now is knighted and seeking a seat in the House of Commons.  Thomas Pitt has been sent back to Special Branch, and the Inner Circle still exerts an evil influence on events.  Some people have a lust for power and are willing to commit crimes to gain their objectives.<br />A spiritualist is murdered.  Her death may be connected to the politics of the coming election.  Pitt must send his wife and children off to the country on their own when his vacation is cancelled.  Investigations lead to some surprising connections between individuals, and Pitt finds his reputation threatened before the case is finally resolved.  Politics breed strange bedfellows, and Pitt's brother-in-law finds himself in an awkward position where he must decide between a friend and his own career in politics.<br />It is better to deal with an enemy you know rather than one you don't know.  Crimes sometimes go unpunished, even murder.	2003-01-21

He finds himself confronted with a tangle of cases that may or may not be related.  There is a Peeping Tom who seems to specialize in blonds, young male hoodlums that rob and sometimes injure elderly women, house burglaries, an older woman who is murdered, and a younger woman raped.  The rapist, as it turns out, gets more than he intended.<br />As the investigations progress to solve the cases, the reader gets a picture of English society.  There is a somewhat rigid class structure related to the educational system.  Tradesmen such as plumbers don't go to the same schools as upper level professionals, and classes don't mix socially even when you were best friends as children.  The main school in Eastvale caters to the masses and has problems similar to those in U.S. schools, e.g., lack of discipline and problems in the school, truant students who are often boored, students mixing with the wrong crowd, etc.<br />As in most English mysteries, guns are rare.  England has severe penalties for unregistered firearms.  Only one gun shows up in this novel.  The story has some sexual content, violence, and language.  It seems well researched and true-to-life.	2003-01-10

Cordelia Gray	This is a reprint of a novel copyrighted in 1977.  It predates Sue Grafton's novels about P.I. Kinsey Millhone, and introduces London P.I. Cordelia Gray, a young woman with a family background even more unusual than Kinsey's.  Having grown up in foster homes and a Catholic boarding school, at the age of 16 she began traveling through Europe with her father's band of left-wing revolutionaries.  Finally settling in London, a job with a temp agency took her to the office of P.I. Bernie Pryde.  She is now 22, and had become an associate of Pryde, inheriting the business on his death.<br />This is Cordelia's first independent case.  She has been hired to investigate the apparent suicide of a prominent scientist's only son.  The case takes some unexpected twists and turns, and she finds herself in danger before the case winds down to a conclusion.  At the end, she meets Chief Inspector Dalgliesh, the main character of other novels by the author.<br />The monetary amounts mentioned (i.e., five pounds a day plus expenses) may seem strange to U.S. readers, even taking into account the 1972 time frame, but one must keep in mind that things were cheaper than they are today and that pay standards in the U.K. have always been less than in the U.S. - one reason for immigration (the old World War II complaint about U.S. servicemen was \\"overpaid, oversexed, and over here\\")<br />The sequel to this novel is \\"The Skull Beneath the Skin.\\"  Sue Grafton's fans should enjoy these novels.	2003-01-06

A pound sterling was worth considerably more than now.  The story covers a one-day period and is a little too compressed in time.<br />The story introduces Nick Miller, a police sergeant with independent financial means.  The case concerns Ben Garvald, just released from serving a sentence for a payroll robbery.  There are people who don't want Ben to come home, including his ex-wife and her sister.  The search for Ben results in a large amount of collateral damage as various characters seem to trip over their own feet.<br />Some of the plot does not seem very realistic, perhaps because monetary amounts seemed too low for the related actions, or perhaps because there is too much action in too short a time period.  It is an OK read, but not one of the best mysteries among novels recently published.	2003-01-03

The case opens up questions about arranged marriages, inheritances, and unrequited love.  The investigation reveals surprises about relationships, motives, and actual events.

Morse is protrayed as an alcoholic diabetic who does not take care of his health.  He gets a substantial portion of his calories from Glenfiddich and various brands of ale.  He has been on medical leave, but is ordered, along with Sgt. Lewis, to take responsibility for investigating a case.  A year before, a married woman with loose morals was found murdered in her bedroom.  The case was never solved, but is now reopened when Chief Inspector Strange reports mysterious telephone calls.<br />The case takes some new twists and turns when people involved start turning up dead.  Investigations reveal that the woman was not the only one sleeping around.  Some evidence had conveniently disappeared during the initial investigation.  The case is well known to Inspector Morse fans as it was a TV production.  However, the written story has some differences from what was on TV, which is usually the case.<br />I would rate the novel PG-13 based on content.	2002-12-12

They were teenage friends in a smaller Irish town and went to London together to seek their fortunes.  Other characters are tightwad Thomas, Tara's significant other who treats her badly; Joe, an account executive at the ad agency who has an interest in Katherine; and Sandro, Fintan's boyfriend and roommate.  Then there is their Swedish friend Liv; Fintan's family including his brother Milo; Lorcan, an egotistical actor and womanizer with a declining career; Lorcan's girlfriend Amy whom he treats badly; Lorcan's fat, balding friend Benjy, who hangs about hoping for one of Lorcan's castoffs; and an assortment of minor characters.<br />The 370 page novel is split into 75 short chapters and an epilogue, covering a one-year period from Tara's 31st birthday party to her 32nd birthday party.  The various related sub-plots develop as the different characters interact.  The title of the novel is defined early when Tara, explaining why she continues to live with Thomas, says &quot;...might I remind you that I'm in the Last Chance Saloon.  In my decrepit, thirty-one-year-old state, I'd probably never get another man.&quot;  The attitude of Tara's friends towards Thomas is best summed up in Chapter 60, &quot;Katherine was pleased that Tara had compared Thomas to a gangrenous limb.  Obviously it was a terrible insult to gangrenous limbs, but it was progress.&quot;<br />Overall, it is an interesting novel dealing with contemporary relationships.  The main characters are in their early 30's.  Like many other novels, the cover art has little relationship to the story.	2002-11-28

The editor has included short notes about the poets, many of whom died young, e.g., Emily Bronte at 30, Robert Burns at 37, Joyce Kilmer at 32 (at the Second Battle of the Marne), Edgar Allan Poe at 40, etc.<br />The poetry ranges from Poe's \\"The Raven\\" to Kilmer's \\"Trees\\" and Longfellow's \\"The Village Blacksmith,\\" among others. It includes many poems that are well known, intermixed with many that are lesser known. The choices are not always the ones I personally would have chosen, but tastes vary from reader to reader.  In some cases the editor has included a full poem where most readers are only familiar with a single verse.	2002-11-25

He discovers that Martin has left him a videotape for safekeeping, but the tape immediately disappears in a robbery.  Various people appear demanding the tape, all disclaiming any knowledge of its whereabouts, and Gerard finds himself caught in the middle.  He finds himself between an ugly man-hating woman who wants to physically hurt him, a widow who seems to have a romantic interest, and a woman police constable who ends up in his bed.<br />The plot provides considerable side information on the art of working with hot glass.  The author, as usual, has done extensive research on a subject.  The main character, Gerard, seems to have considerable financial resources as he has no hesitation about hiring cars and drivers, and seems to have only secondary concerns about money stolen from him.  Gerard seems a bit careless about charging into danger, and does not seem to consider the possibility of collateral damage.  He finds an assortment of allies ranging from young children to street smart toughs.<br />Overall, it is a good mystery with some surprises.  It seems suitable for teenage readers.	2002-11-07

When would be actor Erwin Vandeveer finds himself broke and stranded in Abilene, Texas, he hooks up with Merle Luskey, an oil driller in trouble with his bank.  Merle puts him to work as a roughneck on a drilling rig, and then decides to use Erwin's Harvard education to help solve his financial problems.<br />Oil drilling is intermixed with burglery, industrial espionage, cut-throat business dealings, sabotage, kidnapping, and a lot of hard drinking (Merle seems to survive on red meat and Jack Daniels).  Along the way, they are joined by a well-endowed exotic dancer, a redneck rancher, and an interesting assortment of oil field roughnecks.  A new banker is willing to be the white knight (for a percentage of the action) if the well comes in.<br />The action is fast paced.  The title, by the way, refers to Erwin's new boots.	2002-11-02

This is one of the best mysteries I have read in recent years.  It is an intriguing tale that revolves around the mysterious Visitor to Poe's grave who, every year, leaves three red roses and a half bottle of cognac.  It is January 19. Baltimore private investigator Tess Monaghan and her boyfriend, Crow, are among the spectators keeping watch at Poe's grave.  A cloaked figure appears, and then another.  A shot is fired and a cloaked figure falls, mortally wounded.  The second cloaked figure escapes in the commotion, fading into the shadows.<br />The case becomes complicated.  There are people trying to identify and find the visitor for personal agendas.  There are charges that the murder was a hate crime - the victim identified as a ... waiter.  Tess is drawn into the case, willing or not, because other players think she may have information.  Mysterious notes appear, along with roses or rose petals, from an unknown individual attempting to enlist her aid.  There are questions about thefts of rare books and memorabilia.  And there is collateral damage.<br />Along the way there are tidbits of information about Baltimore, and about Edgar Allan Poe including a pertinent poem (\\"From childhood's hour I have not been As others were; I have not seen As others saw; I could not bring My passions from a common spring.\\" - from Poe's \\"Alone\\").  The case gradually unfolds as information develops about various players.  Some people become unlikely allies, and relationships between people are revealed as the case is solved.  Tess becomes the guardian of another dog, a friendly doberman named Miata.<br />But that is not the end of the story because the Visitor is still involved, a mysterious cloaked figure of many faces, and there must be a meeting before the visitor fades into thin air.  And will the Visitor be back next year?  You might have to go to Baltimore next January 19, if you are willing to spend a cold night at a graveyard.o to Baltimore next January 19, if you are willing to spend a cold night at a graveyard.	2002-10-29

It follows No. 6 (Ramage &amp; the Guillotine) which seemed to be set in 1801, and is one of the sequels to No. 7 (Ramage's Diamond) which seems to be set historically in 1804.  Dudley Pope seemed to have a major problem setting his later novels in proper historical order.  Readers continuing the series should be aware of that problem.  The novels must be read in numerical order for development of Ramage's career, love life, etc., but after No. 7 they seem to drop back to circa 1799 and then progress forward again to 1804. Among other things, the series puts the frigate Calypso in continuous service with the same crew from circa 1799 to 1805.  The frigate and crew become caught in a time warp.  The novels are OK to read in numerical order if one ignores the technical and historical glitches.<br />The present novel has an interesting plot, starting with discovery of French brandy in the ship's water casks.  Ramage is sent off to deal with privateers operating out of the Dutch island of Curacao.  As in other novels in the series, Ramage replaces a real life Royal Navy captain, in this case the captain of the frigate N&eacute;r&eacute;ide.  He continues his extraordinary exploits, destroying enemy frigates, capturing privateers and, in fact, capturing an island.  There is enough action thrown in to keep the novel interesting, but I sometimes wish for a more believable character.  In contrast, Richard Woodman's novels in the Nathaniel Drinkwater series are diligent in correctly following historical events (Woodman provides dates on his chapter headings), and Drinkwater is a much more believable hero.	2002-10-27

In this case, she teams up with Lieutenant Con Dolan, on medical disability from the Santa Teresa Police Department, and retired Dectective Stacey Oliphant of the Santa Teresa County Sheriff's Office.<br />The time setting is early in 1987.  Kinsey is helping out on an 18-year old unsolved murder case.  Con and Stacey had been the men who discovered the body, and they are interested in closing out the case.  A new look at the case reveals new evidence.  The play-by-play is interesting, but the color commentary seems a bit excessive and makes the story drag.  Along the way, Kinsey discovers additional information about her mother's family.  A major part of the story is the rehabilitation of Con and Stacey.<br />The novel has some motion picture potential, where the side commentary could be covered visually.  As an added feature, look in the back of the book for the forensic reconstruction of an unidentified murder victim that the Santa Barbara Sheriff's Office would like help in identifying.	2002-10-22

This one is listed as number 13, but chronologically it appears to be one of five Ramage novels that go after \\"Ramage & the Guillotine\\" which is listed as No. 6, and before \\"Ramage's Diamond,\\" which is listed as No. 7 (see my Listmania listing).  The readers are left a bit adrift trying to determine the correct chronological order (necessary to understand some of the plot). The Peace of Amiens lasted from March 1802 to May 1803. This novel starts at the end of the peace with Ramage and his bride caught in France. The author borrows material from C. S. Forester's Hornblower series to orchestrate Ramage's escape. There is then a sub-plot as Ramage regains command of a frigate (although the author seems to forget details like which year he had Ramage promoted to captain).<br />At his point, history goes off track. The author places the prison colony on Devil's Island considerably before its time (Victor Hugo had things right when he had Jean Valjean sentenced to a prison galley). It is an interesting plot as Ramage uses trickery to capture enemy ships. However the author fills up space with side degressions to describe flora & fauna, weights of ships' stores, etc., when you sometimes wish he would get on with the story (was the author getting old at this point or was the publisher, perhaps, paying him by the word?). As noted by a previous reviewer, the cover art is unrelated to this novel. There are some errors reflecting bad research, e.g., the Dutch still had a monopoly on nutmeg in 1803.	2002-10-08

In between are 9 short stories, some of which are only 6 pages.  As usual with collections, some stories are better than others.  All the stories involve murder, attempted murder, or accidental death, with the exception of \\"Clothes,\\" which is about a compulsive shopper.  As in other English mysteries, guns do not come into play.  Murders tend to be by poison or bludgeon.  The author has an inventive mind when it comes to eliminating people (I would be afraid to get on her wrong side).<br />While some stories are very good, I had trouble getting interested in the long novelette, \\"The Strawberry Tree,\\" which is written in a narrative form with only a little dialogue.  The narrative starts on the island of Majorca with no real indication of why the narrator is there, then skips back 40 years to give an account of past events on Majorca, her life in between, and finally her arrival on Majorca where the story started.  A mystery is introduced along the way, and a solution is finally presented.  This story, like the others, was written in the 1990's, but the Spanish apparently didn't use DNA analysis.	2002-10-05

It would be difficult to understand large portions of the plot without reading the earlier novels.  After the previous novels (\\"Jester's Fortune,\\" etc.), this one was a disappointment.  The novel starts with Lewrie out on the town with his father, with a broken arm and an indication of troubles with his wife.  The author then uses one chapter to flash back to Camperdown to explain the broken arm, and a second chapter to flash back to earlier in the day and a very public confrontation with his wife.  Considering Caroline's past use of a pistol (see \\"the Gun Ketch\\"), Lewrie is lucky to come away with his hide intact.<br />Lewrie finds himself somewhat out of favor at the Admiralty, and is sent off to the West Indies (at least he has a command).  The author tends to use large amounts of space on trivia, while barely mentioning things of significance (delivering dispatches to Admiral Jervis is covered in a sentence).  There are places where the story seems to move forward in jumps.  Old acquaintances are dragged into the story here and there as Lewrie is finally back into action in a series of engagements, either with the enemy or with available women.  The losses from tropical fevers are described by Frederick Hoffman in his autobiography, \\"A Sailor of King George.\\"<br />The novel seems to alternate between naval action, discussions of moral philosophy, short discourses on history or geography, and incidents in Lewrie's love life.  The story is left unfinished.  Caroline has thrown him out and wants most of his assets, his young daughter publicly calls him a sinner, his sons have been sent off to a boarding school, one of his friends wants him as a second in a planned duel, and the evil Choundos is back.  The story has graphic sexual content which does not improve a mediocre novel.	2002-10-05

It is a delightful book for readers in any age group, and is suitable for reading to younger children.<br />A princess could not have a real career, it just wasn't done, so when a princess finds herself faced with an arranged marriage and confinement to a stuffy life at court with a booring husband, she escapes to live with dragons.  Events get somewhat humorous when various princes seem convinced that they have to fight the dragon to rescue her.<br />The troubles of the princess are increased by the intrigues of evil wizards and the political machinations of some of the dragons.  There is a friendly witch to lend a helping hand, various magic mixed in, and another princess or two waiting for a prince to rescue them from their dragons.  It all adds together to make an interesting story.<br />The story is roughly at the reading level of the Harry Potter novels.  This is the first novel in a series which has several sequels you might also consider.	2002-10-02

The only mystery is a side issue of identifying an informer.  It is a cops and robbers novel where the author takes the side of the robbers.  Most of the characters are either reformed villains who somehow avoided prison, or police who have been trying to make a case against them.<br />It took some time for the story to develop while various characters were being introduced and relationships were established.  The first portion of the novel was somewhat dull.  Once the story was sufficiently developed, and the action picked up, it was harder to set the book aside.<br />The main plot concerns restitution, i.e., trying to return stolen paintings to the rightful owners.  This is not as simple as it sounds.  A police inspector wants to catch people with the goods and make a case for his own career advancement.  A band of thieves wants to steal the paintings from the original thieves.  There is also the problem of trying to transport the paintings through customs without getting caught.<br />This is an average length novel of 265 pages broken up into 48 short chapters.  It is a good novel for commuters who want a book to read in installments.  It is a fun book if you don't get offended by being on the side of the villains.	2002-09-27

But he can't just marry anyone -as a wizard he must marry a witch.  So he sets up a competition for local witches.  He will marry the witch who produces the blackest magic (not the coolest move on his part).  The contest brings out an odd assortment of witches including some truly awful hags.  The only attractive witches are an evil witch, Madam Olympia, with her own agenda, and a pretty young witch, Belladonna, who can only seem to produce white magic.  Arriman has reasons for second thoughts, but the competition goes forward.<br />The magic has some surprising results, and there are questions about the power of a familiar.  Is Belladonna a black witch or a white witch?  And how does one deal with a resident ghost who may bore you to death?  Everything seems to work out right in the end, but you don't want to get on the wrong side of a witch as you might end up a toad in the neighborhood pond.	2002-09-21

A young boy, Cat, and his older sister, Gwendolen, are left orphans at an early age, and become wards of the town.  Gwendolen becomes a student of an unscrupulous hedge wizard with his own agenda, before she and Cat are adopted by the mysterious Chrestomanci and taken to live in an even more mysterious castle where the staff have hidden talents.<br />Rivalries between the children and their new found cousins, and a tendency to play magical pranks, keep the story interesting.  To say more would reveal the secrets, but power is not always where you think it is, and some people don't know their own talents.  In spite of evil intentions of the villains, or maybe because of them, some people end up better off then when they started.<br />Overall, this is a good novel for pre-teen to teenage readers, but adults may also enjoy the story.  I thought it was very good.  It is an earlier novel by the author, introducing characters in later novels, and should probably be read before many of the other novels.	2002-09-21

The beginnings of the novel seem a little disjointed while the reader figures out who is who, and what the story is about.  Without reading previous novels in the series, the reader is left at sea in determining relationships between Alvarez and other characters.  Alvarez's main interests in life seem to be food and brandy.<br />The story is about the idle rich.  An older man has a much younger wife who is cheating on him.  An older woman keeps a younger man as a boy toy, and he is cheating on her (he also cheats on the other woman).  There is a complex swindle, attempted murder, and murder.  Alvarez seems to bumble about a bit as he solves the case.  There is a long-winded oration as Alvarez confronts the main suspect (one of those things authors insert to explain a case).<br />Overall, it is a relatively short novel of 176 pages, and is suitable for light reading for a long airline trip or a rainy evening at home.	2002-09-20

While it does contain some action, the author's knowledge of the subject seems to be lacking in some respects.  He speaks of cannon being run out, loaded, and run back in, and of bar shot consisting of two bars connected by a chain (I can't imagine anyone trying to fire that mess from a cannon - bar shot was two half spheres connected by a short bar).<br />The main story concerns the feud between two officers, and the murder of an officer aboard a Royal Navy ship.  Much of the action seems unlikely, but officers could become tyrants aboard their own ships.  A captain commiting piracy by taking supplies from a British ship and then sinking the ship would almost certainly end his career (especially an officer without influence).<br />The story becomes a matter of intrigue aboard the ship, with various factions, secret routes, a hidden compartment, etc.  The plot is based on some of the more evil aspects of Royal Navy service.	2002-09-04

However, the author has used the novel to defend Benedict Arnold and attack almost everyone else. The novel digresses into discussions that become a diatribe of the author's opinions. As a result, this is neither a good novel nor a good history (good objective historical accounts will be found in Ward's \\"The War of the Revolution\\" and other sources).  It is true that Arnold had some successes leading troops when he actually took to the field, but he was also a vain individual who was concerned with his own self interests and comforts, a quality which eventually caused him to become a traitor.  He maintained himself in comfort in Montreal while other officers and their troops were out in the mud exposed to the weather and diseases (General Thomas died from smallpox, and Colonel Bedel was also suffering from smallpox which forced him to relinquish his command at the Cedars).  There is no indication that Benedict Arnold ever missed a meal while the troops out in the field were starving.<br />There were both good and bad officers in the American Army. The officers were handicapped by a new government that had no experience in maintaining armies and fighting a war, by disorganized logistics which left them chronically short of supplies, by poorly trained troops, by feuds between the various colonies, and by diseases common to armies of that time period (smallpox, dysentery, typhus, etc.). Many of the officers became ill and died along with their troops. Campaigns were poorly planned, e.g., the Americans tried to advance down the St. Lawrence without controlling the river (the Royal Navy had control).<br />It is true that the Americans used militia serving for fixed periods of time, often for 90 days. That problem plagued the Army up through the American Civil War. Various accounts of my own ancestors include statements indicating short periods of service at Ticonderoga, Fort Edward, and Bennington.  The author indicates that militia scattered with no plan for regrouping.  That is incorrect.  Colonel Warner's regiment of Vermont Rangers (the Green Mountain Boys) fought a delaying action and were ordered to disperse and regroup at Bennington which they did.  This regrouped regiment joined the battle at a critical moment ensuring the American victory at Bennington.<br />It was the militia regiments raised by Stark and Warner that defeated the British at the decisive Battle of Bennington, the turning point of the war. The author largely ignores Bennington.  He seems to ignore successes and concentrates on failures without providing any balance in his narrative.  It is not possible to write objectively about that part of the war without including the key Battle of Bennington.<br />The novel becomes somewhat long winded, and I found myself skimming through some parts of it. The author does cover the naval action on Lake Champlain, including the battle at Valcour Island. It is interesting to contrast the withdrawal from Ticonderoga with the later stand by the Texans at the Alamo, where the defenders stood fast until they were overwhelmed.

It is a story of the downfall of a ship's officer after he wimps out at a crucial moment.  Where a less sensitive individual may have found the ability to survive, Jim in haunted by his own inner guilt about the incident.  He gradually withdraws from white society.<br />The novel tends to digress and sidetrack while developing characters, so it is some way into the story before the reader learns exactly why Jim is before a maritime court, and even farther along before you discover what actually happened to the steamer Patna.  Jim had a deep desire to do heroic deeds, but an error in judgement makes him a goat.  The balance of the novel is on the life Jim made for himself, and on the people he associates with, as told by a narrator.<br />The novel was first published circa 1900, and reflects the white European attitude towards native populations during that time period.	2002-08-26

This is a somewhat short collection of five stories featuring Inspector Wexford, a person whose age and position are similar to Inspector Morse (as seen on PBS).  Four of the stories are set in England, and one on the Adriatic coast where Inspector Wexford and his wife were on vacation.  Three of the stories involve murders, one a case of switched children, and the last an attempt to reopen an older, historic case.  The settings seem to be in roughly the 1970's to 1980 time frame.<br />I personally thought that the plots were quite good for shorter stories.  The stories reflect English laws and customs, so guns are not used and the violence is considerably less than in the macho, have-gun-will-travel, type novel often found in the U.S. (perhaps this is why many people like English mysteries).  The characters come across well, and the plots are well developed.  In one case, a guilty party is identified, but there is some question as to whether the guilt can be proven in court.	2002-08-26

There are flashbacks to establish characters and relationships.  Various sub-plots wind together to reach a conclusion, but it's not a complete conclusion, even with the epilogue.  If you are looking for a clean, clear-cut case, with a hero prevailing, this is not the book for you.<br />The setting is Boston in the early 1960's.  The story deals with the seamier side of life.  There were still open racial prejudices, and police who kicked down doors and beat non-white citizens who they thought might be guilty of something, especially if they were in the wrong neighborhood.  Drug dealers, informers, and police did their thing, with payoffs in both directions.<br />The main consideration was image.  Things could be done to cover up potential scandals that might embarrass the government, the church, or high placed individuals and their families.  You could get ahead by playing the game, or get trampled by going against the establishment.  Spear carriers sometimes get sacrificed, like pawns in a chess game.	2002-08-21

There are many cases of misplaced trust, and a question is raised in one story - who would you trust, a man selling horses or an attorney?<br />On the side, you will learn a lot about English steeplechase racing.  The characters range from horse owners, trainers, and jockeys, to writers, con men, and even a tramp.  You must be careful who you are unkind to.  There are varying forms of revenge.  Some people are hoisted on their own petards, and some escape justice because of the mischance of others.	2002-08-19

Dashiell Hammett (1894-1961) dropped out of school at the age of 15, working at a variety of jobs before joining the Pinkerton Dectective Agency at the age of 21, working there before and after his service in the US Army during World War I. He came down with TB in the Army, and continuing illnesses made it difficult for him to work, so he became a writer. He is best known for the \\"Maltese Falcon\\" and other novels. He died penniless, largely due to judgements by the IRS for unpaid income taxes.<br />It is apparent from some of the other reviews that reviewers are unfamiliar with the process of publishing a collection.  There are copyrights involved, and it is necessary to obtain permission from the copyright holders, often a different publisher (which may or may not be forthcoming).  There are also fees payable to copyright holders, and demands sometimes make it impractical to include material (I am speaking from personal experience).<br />This collection contains 24 shorter stories originally published between 1923 and 1934, mainly in \\"Black Mask,\\" with one each from \\"Argosy,\\" \\"Mystery Stories,\\" \\"Liberty,\\" and \\"Colliers.\\" The 20 stories from \\"Black Mask\\" feature the Continental Op, a detective from the Continental Detective Agency who is described as fat but never identified by name - call him \\"the Fat Man\\" for purposes of reference. The stories are in narrative form, as told by the main character. There is also an early typescript of \\"The Thin Man,\\" various notes by the author, and biographical material on his life.<br />Rather than being literary masterpieces, these stories were written as entertainment for the masses. They are written in the somewhat macho style of that time period, with dead bodies left about the landscape. The Fat Man is not quite Fearless Fosdick, but he survives more than a normal amount of blows, knife wounds, and near misses from bullets. The stories will appeal to those readers who like live action. They may have less appeal to readers looking for high tech (computers, cell phones, etc.). There are interesting references to the time period with people driving Locomobiles, etc., and directing someone to \\"keep the steam up.\\" A lot of the action is in San Francisco in the 1920's. This was an era before Miranda Rights, etc., when police were more inclined to kick in a door and sometimes slap people aside the head.<br />There are interesting characters sprinkled through the stories. One man has the ultimate con game, hiring himself out as a hit man and collecting the advance with no intention of performing the hit. What can his clients do, complain to the police? His idea of a money tree is someone with lots of enemies.<br />Like most collections, there is some variation in quality. The volume is good value for the money with 900 pages of stories. While well bound, the volume is printed on somewhat thin paper which could be easily damaged.llets. The stories will appeal to those readers who like live action.

It relates to a time period when women could be held in virtual slavery by their husbands.  It deals with a variety of issues including women's rights, pornography, and perversions.  It is more a romance novel than a mystery.  While the novel has interesting sub-plots, perhaps it contains too many to be a good novel.  The author also seems to be on a soap box, and perhaps does a little too much name dropping...<br />Inspector Pitt and Sergeant Tellman find themselves investigating sleazy shops that sell pornographic photos under-the-counter, sometimes to teenage boys - photos that sometimes depict acts that are illegal.  The investigation eventually leads to a solution of the case.  The novel deals with the seamier side of people's lives.  It has content unsuitable for children.

The action picked up at the mid-point.  There are some digressions, and some material seemed borrowed, e.g., the cat seems to come from Lawrence Sanders stories about Timothy Cone.  The main character, Phoebe Siegel, comes across a bit ditsy at times, and lets emotions rule her brain.  Having initially not wanted a case (she has a phobia about March), she hangs onto it tenaciously to the point of not cooperating with federal agents, probably contributing to several deaths.  Phoebe is not someone you want involved in your life.<br />The novel offers a new location for detective fiction with a setting in Billings, Montana.  The plot is a little transparent, with the bad guys and the nature of their crimes becoming apparent early in the story.  There are some interesting sidelights like Phoebe's cat terrorizing the neighbor's dog, but it is mostly about greedy corrupt people and misplaced trust.	2002-07-28

This makes the stories stand-alone novels which can be read independently.  That is a marked contrast to authors who write series of novels about the same character, a practice that often requires reading an entire series to understand the characters.<br />The present novel is not exactly a whodunit because you can identify the guilty parties (or most of them) early in the game. The main plot is how to track them down and bring them to justice.  The chase runs from England to Australia to New Zealand then back to Australia.  As usual with this author, there are horses and racing involved including, in this case, the Melbourne Cup.  There is an interesting system for placing bets.<br />The main character, Charles Todd, is an artist who paints oil paintings of horses.  There is some interesting side information about the chemical deterioration of oil paints on older paintings, an area where most people are probably not well informed.  There is also considerable information about counterfeit paintings.  Let the buyer beware.  The death of his cousin Donald's wife during a burglary sets Todd on the chase.  The main story is fast action over a couple weeks.	2002-07-28

It is a dated cold-war novel, and has a somewhat surrealistic plot.  The story assumes that hundreds of U.S. military officers from the Vietnam War could be transferred to the Soviet Union and be held for over 20 years, along with kidnapped tourists, with nobody finding out.  Come on now, if more than one person knows something it is no longer a secret, and in this case we have thousands of people involved.  It is not like the western powers did not have agents inside the Soviet Union.  And 3,000 agents inside the U.S. with nobody selling out? One would have to be paranoid to believe this (aliens from outer space are hiding among us).<br />The novel digresses a lot into side topics ranging from love affairs to Russian cuisine.  There is a lot of macho breast beating, and too much bumbling around for a secret operation.  The idea of sacrificing a group of individuals for the sake of diplomacy is possible, but any president involved in an event such as the one described in this novel would end his political career, probably be impeached, possibly be tried for criminal conduct, and his political party would be left in ruins.<br />The novel reaches a climax with a long-winded argument in the middle of a battle (that turned me off with Hemingway, and it turned me off with this novel), and an excape with too many people left alive with knowledge that would bring down the government.	2002-07-25

As other reviewers have noted, you have to ignore PR blurbs on the backs of novels or elsewhere.  Streeter's football experience was in college.  After other employment, he started work for a bail bondsman, then expanded into investigative work.  He uses public records and a cell phone, but also wears down shoe leather in the traditional manner.<br />A businessman who owns a couple of pizza parlors and a catering business hires Streeter when he feels he is in danger from a group trying to buy one of his properties as part of a proposed development.  The plot thickens as various operators try to make money by fair means or foul.  Many of the criminal element are not overly bright.  Streeter is joined by a new woman associate who knows how to wiggle her bottom to extract information from men whose egos are bigger than their brains.<br />Overall, it is an interesting tale with various subplots.  Streeter only shoots as a last resort (not really a make-my-day type), and has little luck with women (he does not end up in bed).  There is some unexpected justice as people are hoisted on their own petards, and some people find out who their friends are.	2002-07-25

The main emphasis is on working women, but many of the poems are about relationships. There is a range in style, length, and subject matter. The style ranges from the crude \\"Fight Song\\" to some of a more sentimental nature. Their length varies from one to three pages in an easy to read typeface (Palatino).<br />Overall, it is a collection of 28 poems previously published in \\"The New Yorker\\" (where the author is an editor), \\"Elle,\\" \\"The New York Times,\\" \\"Open City,\\" and \\"Slate.\\" Like other collections, most readers will find some poems they like more than others. It is fun poetry for the masses. It is not for the psuedo-intellectuals who are wrapped up in great authors. A few of the poems remind me of the style/subject matter of Robert Service who wrote poems about everything from dieting to taxes...	2002-07-24

Having personally grown up in a small town in the northwest, I have always regarded New Yorkers as being from an alien culture.  This novel, perhaps, explains some of that culture.<br />The novel is written in a narrative form as related by the main character.  It is written as a series of related short stories, initially about incidents in his childhood, and then about relationships with a succession of women.  He is not exactly a gigolo, but is somewhat a parasite as he camps out with various girlfriends.  He drifts through various jobs, including drummer with a rock band (with a girlfriend who makes sheep noises), but is not overly successful at anything.<br />Just as Alex seems to be developing a serious relationship, it abruptly ends and he is back with his mother.  It seemed like there was a chapter or two missing.  It is a somewhat interesting novel, but easy to set aside.	2002-07-24

Sometimes called &quot;the picture book,&quot; it is an excellent reference illustrating all types of flow including creeping flow, laminar flow, separation, vortices, instability, turbulence, free-surface flow, natural convection, subsonic flow, shock waves, and supersonic flow.  The author has researched the subject of flow visualization, and has acquired illustrations from a wide variety of sources.  I was pleased to see that the book is still in print as it is a very valuable reference.  The author has maintained a relatively low price to make it affordable to students.	2002-07-12

The main character, Malcomb Pembroke, has a knack for making money, particularly in investments in gold, and has become very wealthy (by 1987 standards, when the novel was written).  The problem is the fact that he doesn't get along with his ex-wives and children.  He won't increase allowances set when he was merely rich rather than filthy rich.  His first three ex-wives and their seven children seem to hover about like greedy vultures waiting for him to die so they can inherit the estate.  This is compounded by sibling rivalries, ex-wives poisoning their childrens' minds, and various mental attitudes.  The children are furious when Malcomb starts donating money to charities and spending millions on racehorses.<br />The novel is an interesting whodunit as first Malcomb's fifth wife is murdered, and then attempts are made on his life.  There are many people with motives, mainly in the family.  His son Ian, the only child he trusts, helps unravel the mystery.  The story illustrates how money can corrupt a family.  While the reader can make some guesses, the ending is not obvious.	2002-07-11

It illustrates how people can completely disappear and start life over as a new person.  The story digresses a lot to discuss American Indian lore, and that can be distracting.  One gets the impression that the author is trying to show off his knowledge of the subject.<br />Jane is willing to commit criminal acts to obtain her objectives (the end justifies the means), and some of the people she assisted are not outstanding citizens.  Dealing with the wrong side of the law will eventually get you into trouble.  Jane makes an error in judgement which could get her killed, and compounds that by wanting to operate as a lone wolf with no backup.  Her opponent makes an even bigger mistake, i.e., if you are trying to disappear you do not return to your home area.<br />Overall, the plot is interesting, but I considered it a somewhat average mystery.	2002-07-11

It begins somewhat like Andre Norton's &quot;Scent of Magic&quot; with a young orphan, Skif, being used as child labor in a tavern owned and operated by unsavory relatives.  He escapes from that life to join a gang of young thieves led by an older man who teaches Skif the finer points of picking pockets and cat burglary.  The setting is similar to Charles Dickens' stories set in 19th century London.<br />A tragic change in circumstances sends Skif on a quest for vengeance (while supporting himself as a thief).  Finding himself in a situation where his life may be in danger, he seeks refuge in a temple but continues his cat burglary at night.  His attempt to be a horse thief finds him chosen by a Companion, somewhat to the dismay of the Heralds, and puts him in a position to exact retribution for past wrongs.<br />Skif seems to abandon people as the story moves along.  What became of the young girl he protected from bullies at the school? Does he never go back to visit anyone who befriended him?  Perhaps the Heralds need to teach Skif some social skills.<br />The novel is suitable for teenage readers.	2002-07-08

Like other novels by this author, it has a strange title.  It is set in Alaska at the end of the 20th century.  A bad slump in the fishing industry aggravates conditions caused by harsh weather, dark winters, and isolation. There is alcoholism and related domestic violence.  Men beat their wives and parents abuse their children.  A large number of people sleep around.  The Alaska Bush has also become home to a variety of people ranging from eccentrics to a dangerous psycho.<br />It is September and Wy is flying mail to isolated settlements and preparing to bring out summer people before bad weather.  She dicovers a rural postmistress shot to death behind her counter.  Events are compounded by the discovery of a murdered miner, his wife missing, and later a murdered recluse.  Trooper Liam Campbell is a bit too quick to throw people into jail on flimsy evidence, and does not seem overly concerned about their rights (there is no such thing as ballistics for a shotgun - thousands of guns will produce the same shot pattern).<br />References are made to other women missing in the past, and the case gradually winds forward to a conclusion.  As in the previous novel, there is collateral damage.  It does not pay to be on the premises when Liam is working on a case.  The plot becomes fairly transparent, and the guilty party is known to the readers long before he is known to Liam. At times the story drags a bit when it goes off into side issues.<br />The novel has sexual content, language, and some violence.  Parental guidance is suggested for younger readers.	2002-07-06

The novels should be read in order as substantial references are made to prior interactions between characters.<br />I had expected this to be a mystery. It is more a romance novel as an Alaska trooper woofs after his ex-mistress, both on-duty and off-duty. The story is compounded by various people, both single and married, who are sleeping around. There is also the appearance on the scene of Trooper Liam Campbell's father, an Air Force colonel whom Liam thought was in Florida. Mixed into the story are the Yupik shaman Moses Alakuyak; the ex-mistress, Wy, who runs an air service into the Alaska Bush; an obsessed scientist investigating an old native site; and native Alaskans who dislike the white invaders. There is also a mysterious raven that seems to follow Liam.<br />There are numerous sub-plots. A family is murdered aboard their fishing boat. The graduate assistant helping to excavate the native site is murdered. There are questions about what the graduate assistant found, about why Liam's father is in Alaska, and about who has been sleeping with whom. Wy's newspaper reporter friend shows up to investigate a tip she won't reveal.<br />Liam gets some assistance from a computer guru friend who has information on everyone in the state as the investigation continues. There are some twists and turns with revelations that are sometimes surprising and sometimes not. The trooper, of course, gets his man and also, in this case, his woman. He seems to have a somewhat casual attitude about turning over two men to a killer who murdered them (someone that would get a police officer suspended or fired in any other state). There are a few interesting sidelights as when one character goes into a long tirage against cell phones before throwing another man's cell phone out the front door of a bar, avoiding the probable urge to stuff it where the sun doesn't shine.<br />Overall, the novel is too fragmented into sub-plots, many unrelated. The novel has strong sexual content, language, and some violence. Parental discretion is advised.lated. The novel has strong sexual content, language, and some violence.

The main problem is the fact that they are mismatched and of varying quality.  I gave it four stars because the good ones are really good.  \\"The 17th Day,\\" which takes place during the middle of World War I, is quite good and an accurate picture of casualties among fliers who were sent into combat with a bare minimum of training.  \\"The Man who got Khrushchev\\" is about a secret agent during the Cold War. \\"The Bodyguard and the Client who Wouldn't Die\\" is a mismatch set in future time and unconnected with warfare (unless you consider corporate warfare).  \\"Drang von Osten,\\" is about German infantry retreating from the Russians in World War II, but incorporates weapons which were simply not in use.  \\"UNIDOR,\\" is a cold war Navy action.

When a young parking attendent at a posh private party is found dead on the beach, there is a strong effort by powerful people to sweep everything under the rug.  There are unanswered questions about motives and circumstances of the death.<br />The brother of the deceased is a law student working as a summer associate at a New York City law firm.  He returns to the family's Long Island home, and gathers support from his childhood friends.  It becomes a battle between the townies and the rich summer resident who appears to be implicated in the death.  The rich man has a shady past and some evil strong-arm associates who can intimidate witnesses, or even make them disappear.<br />Money talks, and efforts are brought to bear to quash the case.  The backlash creates a determination to punish evil and the investigation continues as the balance swings back and forth between the bad guys and the good guys.  The wheels of justice grind slowly, but they grind very, very fine.  The investigation reveals many surprises and some sordid relationships.  Like the earlier novel by G. M. Ford, \\"The Deader the Better,\\" this novel has a corrupt law enforcement officer and public exposure of villains.<br />The novel has strong sexual content and violence.

It was completed by the monk Bede in 731 AD and contains a wealth of material he gathered from sources available at that time. He provided an overview of Roman emperors, and gives accounts of conflicts within the Roman empire and particularly within Briton. He provided a good account of Saxons and other invaders and their conflicts with the Romano-Britons. He also provided various sidelights including accounts of miracle cures using holy relics. Unfortuneately, the material is often all too brief, and the original sources seem to have vanished in the dust.  For example, the uprising (led by the warrior queen Boadicea) against the Romans in 61 A.D. is described by Bede in a single sentence in the Greater Chronicle (4021) when, writing of Nero, he states \\"this emperor attempted nothing of a military kind, and even nearly lost Britain, where two of the finest towns were captured and sacked\\" (he is somewhat in error as three towns were burned to the ground, and the entire Roman Ninth Legion was massacred).<br />Chapters are very short, e.g., less than a page. I originally became interested while looking for material on King Arthur. Bede noted in Chapter 11 that after Gratian died, in 407, in his place \\"Constantine, a worthless soldier of the lowest rank, was elected in Britain solely on account of the promise of his name and with no other virtue to recommend him.\\" This Constantine challenged the Romans in Gaul and was defeated and killed by the Roman officer Constantius. It is probable that this Constantine is the one alleged to be the grandfather of Arthur, but no solid connection is found (the name Constantine seems to have been fairly common). In Chapter 16, Bede again refers to the Britons after invaders (Saxons, etc.) had ravaged the land. Bede notes, in reference to the Britons, \\"Their leader at that time was a certain Ambrosius Aurelianus, a discreet man, who was, as it happened, the sole member of the Roman race who had survived this storm in which his parents, who bore a royal and famous name, had perished. Under his leadership the Britons regained their strength...\\" Bede then briefly mentions Mount Badon and goes on to discuss other things (this account appears to have been taken from the monk Gildas, \\"On the Ruin of Britain,\\" written circa 520/540 A.D. - the decisive battle at Mount Badon was circa 516 A.D.).  In the Greater Chronicle (4444), Bede again briefly mentions Ambrosius Aurelianus and \\"his parents, who had worn the purple...\\"<br />The book is sometimes a little hard to follow chronologically because sometimes he gives an actual year AD, and sometimes he gives a particular year in some emperor's reign, e.g., the ninth year in the reign of Emperor so-and-so.  It is somewhat heavy on religious detail, e.g., providing the complete statements by Pope Gregory on allowable marriages between related men and women and on relations between husbands and wives.the Roman race who had survived this storm in which his parents, who bore a royal and famous name, had perished.

The text covers the basic equations of motion, irrotational motion, fluid motion in two dimensions and problems in three dimensions, the motion of solids through a liquid, vortex motion, tidal waves, surface waves, waves of expansion, viscosity, and rotating fluids.  It is recommended as a standard reference for hydrodynamics and physical oceanography.	2002-06-24

They are similar in many respects to the account of Noah found in The Bible, but are different in some other respects, e.g., people and possessions that were placed aboard the ark.  It is worthwhile reading for people studying comparitive religion (who do not have mindset on the issue).  There is no doubt that a large flood occurred in the distant past (recent scientific evidence from the Black Sea indicates an event), but the information contained herein provides a different viewpoint.<br />Besides the information indicated above, there is a wealth of information on ancient Iraq.  The book is very useful for those people studying that era.	2002-06-23

Azazel rides about in the pocket of a friend (descended from magicians and able to summon a demon), and the friend narrates the adventures. The problem is that Azazel wants to be helpful, but the wishes people have in mind are not always translated well in their directions.  It is like programming a computer - you must be very careful (garbage in means garbage out, or in this case bad or incomplete directions may have unexpected results).<br />Want to be attractive to women?  Done!  Whoops, you didn't mean that kind of woman?  Afraid of bullies, and don't want anyone to lay a hand on you?  Done!  Whoops, you didn't mean everyone including your girlfriend?

The Sinking of the Bismark has been covered in longer accounts (and also a motion picture) so the account here could be considered an abridged version of the action.  He also includes accounts of other ships which are fairly well known, e.g., the Lancastria and the Jervis Bay, and many not as well known.  It is of some interest to people studying the history of such events (it provides a quick reference with an overview of the action), as well as interesting to the general reader.  It is an easy to read collection that can be read in segments (ideal for commuter trains, etc.).	2002-06-23

It is written in the style of the period, e.g., Errol Flynn type stories.  It goes into excessive detail at some points which can make the story drag a bit.  In some ways, it reflects a Thomas Hardy type writing style.  It is a narrative style as told by the main character.  Some parts of the action were borrowed by later writers.<br />The setting is March 1812 to April 1815.  Merchant captain Richard Nason is trading with the British, carrying supplies to the British Army in Spain, and is generally opposed to the war, when he is pressed aboard a British Royal Navy sloop.  His attitude changes and (after escaping) he takes a privateer to sea in July 1812 after war is formally declared.  Details of sail handling and such are held to a minimum, and much of the story takes place on land.  He becomes enamored with the young wife of an older English landowner, Sir Arthur Ransome, first meeting her before the war, then again aboard a ship he captures.<br />After various adventures he is captured and imprisoned at Dartmoor along with his crew.  A major part of the novel is concerned with Dartmoor prison commanded by the evil Royal Navy Captain Shortland.  The prison was par for the course for that time period.  Similar conditions were found in both Union and Confederate prisons during the American Civil War 50 years later. Deaths from disease were common in active Army and Navy forces, usually higher numbers than battle deaths, and deaths in prisons were undoubtedly higher (smallpox, typhus, etc.).  The novel describes the deliberate massacre of American POWs three months after the war ended.<br />Captain Nason, of course, survives (narrators usually survive), meets the woman again, etc.	2002-06-22

The novel is set in November 1986. The plot starts out a bit slow, but the pace picks up as the story develops. Kinsey is hired to investigate the disappearance of a prominent local doctor. The investigation opens many cans of worms. There is his ex-wife, broke and benefiting from a life insurance policy; his present wife and her personal trainer; an out-of-control stepdaughter and her friend; the ex-husband of the present wife; and some associates in a business which is under investigation for Medicare fraud.<br />Things are compounded by a pair of brothers interested in renting Kinsey a new office, and an investigator looking for missing jewels (sub-plot number one). There is also the question of mysterious withdrawals from the doctor's bank account over a period of time (sub-plot number two). Many of the characters in the novel are over-extended financially (living on credit cards). Considering how often Kinsey lies to people in the course of an investigation (and how often she breaks the law), it is amazing how much she trusts other people.<br />You can guess about guilty parties along the way, but the case has a few surprising twists. Even at the end, things are not certain. A suspect is implied, but the evidence is such that it would be hard to prove in court. Only one sub-plot has someone with a smoking gun. Some of the actions seem improbable, but criminals are not known for brillance. There are a few glitches, like the fact that rain would increase the reservoir water levels.	2002-06-20

While some people prefer to read a series in order, these can be read as stand alone novels.  Like Sherlock Holmes and other good series, each is an entirely separate case.  This novel is a fast paced mystery that is hard to put down.  It kept me up late.<br />Holland is hired to investigate the disappearance of a woman seven months earlier.  The door to their house was standing open when her husband arrived, and she was gone with nothing but the clothes on her back.  Foul play is suspected.  There is a list of suspects including her husband (who is trying to collect on a life insurance policy) and former co-workers.  She was young, pretty, and extremely intelligent.<br />As the investigation proceeds, it goes through twists and turns, right up to the last page.  Every time you think you know the solution, there is another twist.  I was reminded of an old song refrain, &quot;Never, never trust a woman.  You'll be sorry if you do.&quot;  There are a lot of sleazy people involved.  One has to wonder at the end if everyone really got what they deserved.	2002-06-13

On the other hand, some details related to the case never seem to be fully explained.  The plot is somewhat transparent for a whodunit, i.e., you can guess the identity of villains before they are exposed.<br />The setting is London in 1889.  Five years earlier a brutal murder had outraged the public.  Police were previously criticized for not catching Jack the Ripper.  Pressures for an arrest in this case led to the conviction and hanging of a Jewish actor.  Anti-semitism had run high with attacks on Jews and Jewish owned businesses.  Now questions have been raised.<br />A Justice who had served on the appeals court for the case is looking into it again.  When he dies during a theatre performance, Inspector Thomas Pitt is assigned to investigate, and he re-examines the old case the Justice was reviewing.  There is strong pressure not to rock the boat.  A reversal in the five-year old case would embarass many people from individual policemen to Justices of the appeals court.  Some surprising facts are revealed as the case draws to its conclusion.  As a sidelight, Charlotte's maid Gracie acquires a young admirer.<br />Like other novels in this series, we are provided with a picture of Victorian era society in London.  The novel has some amount of violence and some references to sexual encounters.	2002-06-12

However, it was hard to put down.  It's an interesting whodunit with fast action over a period of a month or two, including an extended stay in the hospital.  Holland Taylor is somewhat a loose cannon, tending to charge in where he should use caution.  When you add his attitude, you can wonder how he stays alive and out of jail.  In places, it is a manual on how to be a jerk.<br />An older friend of Holland's parents has been bilked by an investment advisor who was managing her money.  Holland charges in against the advice of his girlfriend/attorney and stirs up a cesspool of wrongdoing.  It is all about mistresses and money.  When people are killed it appears that a third party is gunning for both sides.  As the plot winds to a conclusion, Holland finds who his friends are.<br />The plot has details of computer crime and harassment. It demonstrates that businesses taking telephone orders should use caller i.d., and anyone taking over the counter orders should ask for photo identification.  Based on language and violence, I would give it a PG-13 rating.	2002-06-11

The year is 1986.  Kinsey's first husband was never that far away, but they had not been in contact for 14 years.  A box of old belongings, from an abandoned storage unit, and a visit by two LAPD detectives, drags Kinsey back into her past.  She ends up investigating why her ex-husband was shot.  Dredging into the past, she discovers she misjudged him in regard to one issue, but had been blind to a different fault.<br />Investigation of both the past and present reveals an entirely different picture of things from what Kinsey had believed, and it becomes a whodunit until the real villain is revealed.  Along the way, we discover some flaws in Kinsey's own character.  She risks major criminal prosecution to obtain some minor gains (the scene with the dog is funny), and fails to cooperate with the police to the point of being obstructive.  She also does enough dumb things to make one wonder how she survives.  Perhaps the criminals are dumber.<br />Overall, the book is light reading for a rainy day.  There is some violence, but nothing overly graphic.  There is some mention of sexual encounters, but nothing descriptive.	2002-06-10

Members of Parliament (MPs), walking past the statue every day, contended that women did not have the ability to understand issues and vote intelligently.  The year is 1888 and women's rights are a contentious issue.  When MPs have their throats cut on the way home from evening sessions, suspicion points in many directions.  Was it a radical women's rights advocate, a demented anarchist, or perhaps someone benefiting financially?<br />Thomas Pitt and his wife, Charlotte, become involved in the investigation.  The entire issue of women's rights unfolds including various repressive laws.  There are issues of inheritance, child custody, and a wife's obligations to her husband (religious fundamentalists in the U.S. have been revisiting this issue).  This is a real whodunit with a surprising conclusion.  The novel provides a good picture of the English social structure of that time period.	2002-06-10

It is a tale of political intrigue and assassins on an alternate world in a medieval setting, with some amount of magic added in.  The story skips back and forth between a large cast of characters including the main assassin, the double-dealing government minister who hires her, the leader of the rebels, a mage in the desert, other assassins and government ministers, the main assassin's niece and her friend, etc.  The novel periodically skips back in time to bring one character or another up to date.<br />The assassin is hired to eliminate a decadent First Minister, but the job turns out to have complications.  Double crosses are the rule of the day, and bodies start to accumulate.  There are agents betraying agents, a bugged office, stolen secret papers, dungeons and torture, truth spells, etc., as the Assassins Guild tries to even accounts with the main villain.  Sometimes people seem to trip over each other's feet.  Don't assume that the assassin is unarmed because she is naked (big mistake), and if she is running loose it can be your worst nightmare.	2002-06-10

After over 20 years of war, peace has brought a reduced Army and Navy.  Tens of thousands of soldiers and sailors have been dumped out onto the streets with no jobs and few skills.  The country is overrun with beggers and tramps.  Protection of domestic agriculture (restrictions on grain imports) have driven up prices.  Lower class poor are starving.  There have been riots.  The government has become repressive to hold the mobs in check (poor people had no vote).  Over 200 crimes carry the death penalty ranging from theft to murder.  A speedy trial was the rule of the day.  In assembly line fashion, the total process of accusation, arrest, trial, conviction, appeal, and execution was accomplished in a few weeks.<br />The prologue of the novel describes a hanging fair, including the stench inside the prison, the preparation of the condemned for hanging, the walk to the gallows, the actual public execution before the mob of spectators (one man's hanging is another man's entertainment), and the diposal of the bodies - some to surgeons for dissection.  The detailed description is not for the squeamish.  A young woman, falsely accused, is hanged for theft. She must be guilty because she was convicted.  Hang 'em all.  Let God sort them out.<br />Captain Rider Sandman is unemployed and living in penury in the garret of a disreputable tavern (he has sold his commission and his father's bankruptcy and suicide left his family without funds).  He is employed by the Home Secretary to investigate a case involving the murder of a Countess.  The Queen has taken an interest.  Matters are complicated because the government does not want a conviction overturned.  A man has been convicted so he must be guilty.  The execution is scheduled in a week, so he doesn't have much time.<br />Captain Sandman discovers that the dead woman's servants are missing.  His investigation antagonizes a group of powerful young lords, but he acquires an assortment of allies.  The story winds forward as he rushes to complete the investigation before the man is hanged.  Time is running out.  The story has a somewhat surprising conclusion as evidence reveals the true nature of events.<br />The novel provides some insights into English society of that time period including the \\"justice\\" system.  The lower classes had no votes and few rights, being held in economic servitude.  The story seems to drag a bit in places as you wait for people to get on with things.

Collections of Kipling's poems have been published many times over the years, but many of them were not complete. This collection includes many not found elsewhere. Many of his poems are about the British Army or the British Empire, but there are also poems on other topics. Some of Kipling's poems are better known than others, e.g., \\"Gunga Din.\\" A few have been set to music, e.g., \\"Mandalay\\" and \\"Gentlemen-Rankers.\\" In some cases, particular lines are well known such as, \\"Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet (from \\"The Ballad of East and West\\") or \\"the Colonel's Lady and Judy O'Grady are sisters under their skins\\" (from \\"The Ladies). Some of the poems were concerned with the poor treatment of British soldiers for whom Kipling was a champion, including \\"Shillin' a Day,\\" \\"Back to the Army Again,\\" \\"The Last of the Light Brigade,\\" and \\"Tommy\\" (\\"I went into a public 'ouse to get a pint of beer, the publican 'e up an' sez, 'we serve no redcoats here' \\").<br />Overall, it is a good, wide-ranging collection of poetry covering an extended time period. The collection is recommended for all age groups, although some poems might have to be explained to children. The poems were written at a different time in history, and readers should be aware that some of them may express prejudices and language of that period (\\"for she knifed me one night, 'cause I wished she was white, and I learned about women from 'er,\\" from \\"The Ladies\\")	2002-05-29

It is the standard melodrama expanded to a galactic scale, with the local representative of the villains forcing his unwanted attentions on the heroine.<br />Pik Lando and his ship, the Tinker's Damn, have been drafted into service to smuggle a cargo of fertilizer concentrates onto the planet Angel.  An unlikely cargo for a smuggler, but one that is vital for the farmers on the soil poor planet.  Mega-Metals is using extreme means including murder to keep vital supplies from reaching the farmers.<br />After the first mission, Lando is recruited for a second, very secret mission that will undo the plans of the villains and give The Chosen possession of the planet.  The conclusion of the novel is somewhat disappointing as Lando and the heroine go their separate ways.  The final ending of the novel could have been deleted with no loss to the story as the novel digresses into a new tale.  Perhaps the author was setting the stage for his next novel.	2002-05-28

The authors keep referring back to some supposed previous actions.  Many of the novel's characters seem to be only partially developed.<br />Overall, it is an average adventure novel.

For as long as wars have been fought, invading armies have looted the countryside. It was one of the perquisites of the common soldier. During World War II, the German government systematically looted conquered territories, taking valuable artwork back to Germany. In the confusion during the closing days of the war, a truckload of valuable paintings vanishes, but an inventory of the truck's contents remains in the German records.<br />Benjamin Revere is an art expert living in Boston. Over 50 years have passed, and one of the missing paintings has just shown up in a Boston pawn shop. When the pawn shop owner is killed, Ben is drawn into the investigation. The case seems at a dead end until a companion painting shows up in Austria in the hands of a shady Hungarian. When Ben is contacted by an Austrian count, who claims to be the son of the original owner of the painting, Ben leaves home to travel to Austria, Russia, and Hungary to track down information.<br />The case is complicated when people come out of the woodwork with competing claims for the Boston painting (estimated value of over $5 million). A trail of dead bodies develops when people associated with the paintings are murdered. It becomes an interesting case of intrigue as Ben tracks down the paintings, with some surprising revelations. There are some comments on different countries' attitudes relating to the ownership of looted art, including references to the Elgin marbles now in England.	2002-05-27

The murder of an ex-con who had served time for killing Taylor's wife and child while the man was driving drunk puts some suspicion on Taylor.  His own investigation of the murder leads into the gubernatorial campaign.<br />When he is hired to recover a video tape, supposedly being used for blackmail, Taylor stumbles into a string of dead bodies.

Some people want the tape revealed, and others want it destroyed.<br />The story concludes with some surprising revelations.

His suicidal co-worker, Kris Ironside, takes him along on a fly-in to a Sunday luncheon at Newmarket where he meets an interesting group of guests, and a visit to the local stables finds a prize racehorse extremely ill from unknown causes.  The plot then moves forward to an invitation to join Kris in Miami and the West Indies as a houseguest of some of the Newmarket people.  Kris has been offerred an airplane to fly through a hurricane, with a side trip to check out a small isolated island.  Flying through a hurricane, of course, turns into a disaster that involves Perry in a strange situation.<br />The plot seems a little improbable as bumbling criminal wannabes trip over their own feet.  Divided leadership among the criminal elements causes them many problems.  Perry finds himself caught between shady individuals on one side, and an unknown government agency on the other.  He seems to have a hero's nine lives as he survives airplane crashes, illness, and physical attacks on his person.  He emerges battered and victorious as the story twists and turns to reach a conclusion.<br />The novel has an interesting readable plot, but I would not classify it as great literature.  One has to assume that the villains are taking dumb pills (not consistent with their business success) and the hero has the survival abilities of Al Capp's Fearless Fosdick.	2002-05-26

The sheriff has other problems closer to home than the king's highway, including his personal love life, wandering pigs, local thieves, and tax collections.  The sheriff's encounter with Robin Hood causes him to get religion.  There is no Maid Marian in this novel - in fact Robin Hood's band tends to be unattractive, grubby social outcasts.<br />The novel digresses into detailed descriptions of torture.

Readers familiar with the real location may have problems with the novel. For people from outside the Puget Sound/ Olympic Peninsula area, it might be an interesting cops and robbers tale.<br />Seattle PI Leo Waterman has a friend who has acquired property to start a small resort and work as a fishing guide.  He is an outsider in a small town, where locals have their own ideas for the property.  Conflicts with the local red necks and power brokers turn lethal.  Leo brings in an assortment of street people, thieves, and shadowy individuals to exact retribution.  Leo is not a nice guy when you get on his wrong side.<br />The novel starts out on a different case before getting to the main plot, and meanders at some points.  It is hard to say if anyone wins in the end as everyone, including Leo, gets banged up, and we seem to be left with a trail of broken bodies and shattered dreams.

It seems the usurer was also a blackmailer.  Someone else may now have information damaging to various people.<br />The novel provides a good picture of the social climbing and snobishness of Victorian England, where the old school tie meant a lot, mistresses were OK as long as you were discreet, and an exposed skeleton could ruin you socially, destroy your children's marriage prospects, and get you blackballed from club membership. People were expected to be seen in the right places, but you could not accept invitations unless you returned them, and a woman could not possibly wear the same dress or hat to two functions.<br />Events are compounded by a shadowy secret society that goes beyond the old school tie.  People are not telling the whole truth about their relationships, and investigations by Pitt (with some additional nosing around by his wife) reveal well hidden secrets.  The novel comes to a surprising conclusion as truths are revealed.<br />The novel has some sexual content and violence.	2002-05-08

Lecky (History of European Morals, 1869) in regard to the Byzantine Empire - \\"The history of the empire is a monotonous story of the intrigues of priests, eunuchs and women, of poisonings, of conspiracies, of uniform ingratitude, of perpetual fratricides.\\"  The present novel creates an alternate world empire, with the story based on an altered version of the rise of Basil I (in this story Krispos) and the Byzantine Emperor Michael III (in this story Anthimos), with some amount of magic added in.<br />The novel gives a fairly accurate depiction of a Byzantine type empire where various people scheme to obtain power, barbarians raid the borders, and nobels live high on the hog while peasants often starve.  The novel follows Krispos' rise to power from his early beginnings as a peasant child carried into captivity by barbarian raiders.  Along the way he must survive crippling taxation, epidemics, barbarian raids, homosexual overtures, and attempted assassinations.<br />The novel has significant sexual content (including orgy style banquets), homosexual relationships, and some violence.  Based on content, I would give it a PG-13 rating.	2002-05-07

The trail takes Tamara behind the glitter of Atlantic City, into the seamier side of life.  The city has become a magnet for both homeless teenagers and evil people who prey on them.  An evil man, from unknown origins, is protected by powerful people he is supplying with young women.<br />Tamara's search for Gabriella Desmond leads her into a snakepit where her own life is in danger.  People who knew Gabriella turn up dead, and Gabriella does not want to be found.  Along the way, Tamara's old friend Basil appears.  The plot ends with a surprising double twist.<br />A procurer is eliminated, but who did he work for?  The story leaves powerful people unidentified, including one killer who is still out there as a 21st century Bluebeard.  In that respect, the black hats win.

The Honorable East India Company has control of trade with India and much of the trade with China, at that time a frontier area for European powers, far from home and where people seemed to make their own laws.  The novel continues the adventures of Adam Horne, a captain in the Bombay Marines.<br />A highly placed company employee has helped himself to company money and a company ship.  Horne is sent in pursuit.  He soon finds himself caught up in the middle of a scheme by a group in England who are attempting to break the monopoly on Far East trade.  Horne finds himself contending on the one hand with the renegade trader, and on the other hand with Chinese officials who have ideas of their own.  Along the way he has a gratuitous encounter with Sulu pirates.<br />It becomes a risky high-stakes game where winning can make a man wealthy but losing can leave him locked in a dungeon.  The hero, of course, must prevail if for no other reason than the fact that the commodore's wife has a niece arriving in India who needs a husband.	2002-04-23

He discovered that the best people to use on a stakeout are the street people who are a normal part of the cityscape. He also gets help from his relatives scattered throughout the city's civil service thanks to the nepotism of his late father.<br />Leo is hired to defuse a situation between two rival steakhouse chains whose actions might disrupt an international convention at one of Seattle's leading hotels. A side issue is saving Bunky (a prize bull) from being turned into pit roasted beef for the opening of a new steakhouse. Events start to explode when a food critic caught between the rivals gets a bullet in the head.<br />The action is confined to about one week as events rapidly develop. Along the way, you will obtain some sidelights on Seattle and an overview of the homeless who live their own lifestyle. I won't reveal the ending, but it could only happen in Seattle. It would make a wild motion picture.<br />The author is correct about the afternoon traffic jam developing at 2:30, as this reviewer discovered to his dismay during a recent visit.

Such was not the case.  The British fired on any unauthorized ship attempting to approach the island including, in one case, a ship in distress.  Other than that, it is an interesting tale.<br />This is the last novel, chronologically, in the Richard Sharpe series.  Sharpe is separated from his wife and living in France with his latest mistress and their two children.  His shortage of money indicates his wife in England has everything he stole in Spain.  When the Countess of Mouromorto shows up to hire Sharpe to find her missing husband in Chile, his mistress is very receptive to the sight of the money (needed to improve her farm). Sharpe finds himself on his way to Chile with his old friend Patrick Harper, and makes the aforementioned stop at St. Helena to see Napoleon.<br />Sharpe and Harper become involved, unwillingly, in the civil war raging in Chile between the Spanish royalists and the rebels under O'Higgins (supported by Lord Cochrane).  Sharpe's fortunes take some twists and turns, as does the plot.  The involvement of Lord Cochrane in Chile is described fairly accurately, including the action at Valdivia.  Sharpe, of course, gets his share of the spoils.  One can hope that Sharpe will fare better with his latest mistress than he has with earlier women in his life.  Having Sharpe acquire bags full of loot always creates the possibility of further action (after all, Lord Cochrane did invite him to go along, and we know from history that Lord Cochrane later served in Brazil and Greece).	2002-04-18

This is akin to relating the taste of any strange mystery meat to the taste of chicken.  There is absolutely no relationship between the present book and O'Brien's fiction.  One can wonder if some reviewers actually read the books they review.  Having said that -<br />The book provides an interesting overview of early Antarctic exploration, both planned and accidental.  There is a chapter on scurvy, the bane of historic long sea voyages, with indications of the various means used for prevention - as usual, politics got in the way of common sense (the British government used lime juice controlled by British interests instead of the more effective lemon juice controlled by Spanish interests) and the government was slow to adopt what was being routinely used in the private sector.  There is also a chapter on the problems in finding longitude, and an overview chapter on the Southern Ocean and the Antarctic Convergence.<br />Accounts of the voyages begin with Edmund Halley's expedition aboard the Paramore in the closing years of the 17th century, then skip forward to the second voyage of James Cook (1772-1775). Sealers began their activities immediately after the American Revolution.  One problem with scientific exploration, then as now, was that commercial interests immediately rushed in to exploit any resources discovered, initially decimating the fur seal population.  John Nicol in his autobiography (see John Nicol, Mariner) mentions being aboard the Amelia (1791-1792) when they killed and skinned 30,000 seals at the Island of Lopex (Lobos Island in northern Peru).  The sealers added some knowledge, but mainly to identify sealing grounds.  There are some comments about diet - people commonly ate penguins among other things.<br />People carrying out research are familiar with dealing with bureaucracies that want proposals two or three years in advance with an indication of what discoveries will be made before the research is conducted.  Consequently, real discoveries are often unfunded, i.e., it is work carried out on the side while carrying out other funded work.  William Smith commanded the merchant ship Williams on a voyage from Buenos Aires to Valparaiso when he discovered the South Shetland Islands, somewhat by accident, early in 1819 while sailing westward around Cape Horn.  On a subsequent voyage around the Horn that same year, he made an unauthorized deviation in his route to go south for further exploration (insurance companies tended to forbid such deviations).  After he reported his discoveries, the Royal Navy chartered the Williams later that same year and, under the command of Edward Bransfield, made the first observations of the mountain ranges on the Antarctic Peninsula and sailed a short distance into the Weddell Sea (the British lost Bransfield's journal).  The immediate rush of sealers into the area resulted in the slaughtering of an estimated half million seals during the 1820-1821 season.  Forty sealing ships visited the islands during the 1821-1822 season and essentially exterminated the remaining seals.  William Smith eventually died in poverty in an almshouse.<br />The book goes on to discuss the voyages of James Clark Ross, James Weddell, and others up through 1839, with some mention of later expeditions.  It provides a good description of the early Antarctic explorers and their voyages through the ice and freezing temperatures.ation of what discoveries will be made before the research is conducted.

It has an original copyright of 1992, but was recently reprinted.  It is written in the style of Errol Flynn motion pictures, i.e., good guys chasing and pounding on bad guys, with a female role added in (it would do for a B grade motion picture).  There is considerable violence but no real sexual content.<br />It is part of the continuing Patrick Dalton Saga, as Dalton sails as \\"a man without a country,\\" claiming allegiance to no particular country, but looking for opportunities.  He is a man given a noble purpose, fighting pirate ships, and claiming salvage for profit when he can.  The story is a little unrealistic from the historical standpoint (people were more inclined to put profit ahead of good deeds) but illustrates the confused state of things along the Atlantic seaboard in 1778.  The story is somewhat like the Perils of Pauline, left unfinished with a villain not brought to justice, apparently as a lead in to a sequel.  While not great literature, it can provide an interesting story to read on a rainy day, and is probably better than watching summer reruns on TV.	2002-04-08

The setting is present day Locust Point, Baltimore, with side excursions to nearby areas.  Political corruption extends down through the social structure, and sets off chains of events - \\"damage control\\" can sometimes cause greater damage.<br />Tess Monaghan opens a can of worms when she investigates the death of a Jane Doe, a young woman of indeterminate age (an apparent runaway) who was accidentally killed in an encounter with a local glue sniffer.  People in power had quietly buried the case but, to quote the Bible, \\"your sins will find you out.\\" Identifying the woman implicates a wide variety of individuals who have committed (or are commiting) an assortment of crimes.<br />Tess can be tenacious, and don't get on her wrong side as she believes in retribution.

It is necessary to read the first two books of the series to understand the story.  This novel seems to be set in December 1805 and/or January 1806.  Like some other authors, Perkins has compressed the action into too short a time frame.  People dash about at breakneck speeds.  Evidence of the author's lack of time sense shows up when he mentions a sailing ship going from London to Botany Bay in 100 days - a journey that would have taken 9 or 10 months at a minimum in 1805.  The late Patrick O'Brien also seemed to have that problem.<br />The novel finds Bartholomew Hoare finally coming to grips with the main French agent in London.  The man had deluded various people with visions of grandeur if they supported Napolean, and had purchased other people's services with gold.  The spymaster is a bit inept, and things start to come apart in his organization when Hoare sets the crew of the Royal Duke on the man's trail.  The man kidnaps Hoare's new wife and their adopted child, and tries to toy with Commander Hoare instead of killing him - a dangerous mistake.<br />The royal family is shown in an unfavorable light.  There are also comments on the attitudes towards lower classes.  When a woman's maid is raped and murdered, it is brushed aside by a comment that \\"she was only a servant.\\"<br />Overall, it could have been a better novel.  The plot is good, but at points the author rambles and digresses.  He seems to go into side details when they are not needed, and tries to throw in too much nautical jargon.  He also repeats jokes - something that is amuzing the first time tends to get stale with constant retelling (the author must have been insufferable at parties).  He makes the assumption that an admiral who was promoted up through the various ranks would be unfamiliar with the process.  He also gets a bit surreal in a final chase through underground passageways.  As in the other novels, a map would have been helpful.helpful.	2002-04-02

This story is set in October and November 1805.  Hoare has been promoted to commander and finds himself in command of an unusual ship, the Royal Duke, with an unusual crew (including several women - women were not unusual in a crew, see John Nicol's biography).  He is in charge of \\"special investigations\\" which includes naval intellegence services.<br />The discovery of two murdered Royal Navy captains plunges Hoare into intrigue involving British traitors and unknown French agents.  Hoare is still handicapped by an inability to raise his voice above a loud whisper, but he can whistle and he can pass commands through a loyal lieutenant aboard the Royal Duke.  He has an unfortunate encounter with H.R.H. the Duke of Cumberland, a desolute rogue (the royal family receives some unflattering descriptions).  Events lead to the disposal of some enemies, but the continuation of the story is left to the third novel of the trilogy, \\"Hoare and the Matter of Treason.\\"<br />The author has a bad tendency to forget details as the story proceeds.  In the previous novel, Lieutenant Kingsley is shot while in confinement.  In this novel, it is stated he was hanged. Also, four roughs captured in the novel become two in number by the time they are turned over to authorities.  The gratuitous mention of James Aubrey is out of place.  The ficticious Aubrey is referred to as a \\"successful frigate captain,\\" but in O'Brien's series of novels Aubrey's early success (prior to 1805) was as a commander in a sloop - as was the real life Commander Lord Cochrane who served as the model for the fictional Aubrey.  The novel lacks a map which would have been helpful.	2002-03-31

First, Lieutenant Hoare is called upon to aid in the defense of a young lieutenant accused of murdering his captain. The Royal Navy is quite willing to hang the defendent, guilty or innocent, in order to close the case and get on with the war. Hoare's inquiries raise questions about the case, including a missing marine. Meanwhile, some mysterious unexplained events are occurring in Portsmouth and nearby areas.<br />The resolution of the murder case plunges Hoare into the intrigue surrounding the destruction of Royal Navy ships.  French agents are exposed, but people have a tendency to die before they can reveal what they know.  Hoare makes some enemies, but also finds some new friends (who carry over into the sequel).  There is also the young orphan Jenny, and a love interest starts to develop. The novel lacks a map of the area, which would have been useful to readers. There is a short glossery of terms.<br />Hoare is handicapped from an injury that prevents him from speaking loudly. His whispery voice cannot be raised to the shouts needed to command at sea. The Royal Navy, however, has other uses for Hoare, and his career continues in the sequel.	2002-03-28

He escaped at an early age to live on the streets.  At best he is a rogue; at worst a murderous thug who will cut the throat of an enemy without a second thought.  This novel finds him destitute after losing the fortune stolen in India.  He returns to the fondling home 20 years after his escape to seek revenge plus obtaining some money.  Events leave him on the run, but British government officials happen to need a lower class thug for a special mission and Sharpe's other sins can be overlooked.<br />The mission takes Sharpe to 1807 Copenhagen along with 43,000 pounds in gold intended as a bribe.  This is like setting a fox to guard a henhouse.  When his upper class traveling companion disappears with the gold, Sharpe must find both.  This leads him into Copenhagen just ahead of the British attack on the city.  He is caught up in intrigue and people changing sides.  He eventually is able to get back to British lines, but then must return to find both the traitor and the gold.  The novel has some climatic action in the middle of a heavy British bombardment of the city.  Along the way, Sharpe finds a new woman then loses her again, continuing his bad luck with women.<br />And then there is the gold, equivalent to about 40 million pounds in today's economy, which has passed through many hands without receipts.  Soldiers were being hanged for petty looting, but officials were willing to turn a blind eye where there was gold, as long as they got their share.<br />As a side note, the 1807 attack on Copenhagen is described in some detail in Robert C. Wing's biography of Peter Puget.  Puget, then a Royal Navy captain, commanded the inshore squadron of small vessels that bombarded the city.<br />Based on content, I would give the novel a PG-13 rating.	2002-03-19

It is recommended for a long airline flight, relaxing at the beach, or a rainy evening at home. It is mystery No. 12 in the Vineyard series. While some people prefer to read the series in order, this one can be read as a stand along book. J.W. Jackson has his past catch up with him when he becomes involved with his ex-wife (after 15 years), her second husband, and the criminals he left behind in Boston.<br />J.W. is retired on disability from the Boston P.D. after being shot while on duty. He lives on Martha's Vineyard with his wife, Zee, their two young children, and two cats (but no dog in spite of his children's pleas). His preference for retirement is fishing, claming, occasional boating, and socializing with family and friends. His quiet life is disrupted by intruders from the mainland, in this case his ex-wife's husband and the hard cases looking for him for reasons not entirely clear (the man is not overly truthful about circumstances).<br />Yuppies spending themselves into debt, gambling, drugs, two timing men and women, criminal elements, and J.W.'s old Boston friends all figure into the plot. Two thugs make a bad mistake (fatal for one) when they try to rough up Zee. Zee then gets irked when J.W. tries to help his ex-wife by pulling her husband out of the hole he dug himself into. The plot, as they say, thickens. It takes a major effort by J.W. to restore things to a peaceful retirement. His children acquire some goldfish, but no dog, at least not yet.	2002-03-11

I was pleased to see that it was reprinted.  A British rifleman has been cut off behind enemy lines by the French advance into Portugal during the Napoleonic Wars.  The British Army was pushed back to a last line of defense.  The rifleman continues to do what he can to stop the French advance, with no hope for personal recognition or rewards (no banners, no bands), and a slim chance of survival.  Highly trained to do his duty, he takes to the woods, scouts the enemy, and carries out hit and run raiding.<br />The novel is a study of one man's commitment to duty taking precedence over his own personal survival.  It shows how one man with ability, courage, and initiative can make a difference to the outcome of a war.  Rifleman Dodd is placed at the turning of the tide.	2002-03-05

It does not cover his early life (covered to some extent in \\"Sharpe's Regiment\\"), or his actual beginnings in the British Army, but starts somewhat abruptly with Private Sharpe serving in the 33rd's Light Company in India and contemplating desertion.  It introduces the beginnings of Sharpe's contact with the odious Sergeant Hakeswill, a cowardly bully who becomes Sharpe's personal troll, riding his shoulder to torment him in later novels in the series.<br />Hakeswill wants Sharpe's woman Mary (the widow of another sergeant), for his own evil purposes.  Hakeswill conspires with Captain Morris, who is in need of money, to get rid of Sharpe on trumped up charges.  Sharpe survives what might have been a death sentence when his lashing is stopped at 202, and he is sent off on a special mission.  The woman eventually catches a bigger fish and goes her own way, free of both Sharpe and Hakeswill.  She was not Sharpe's first woman (see \\"Sharpe's Regiment\\"), and will not be the last.<br />The main plot concerns the defeat of the Muslim Tippoo at Seringapatam in 1799.  The Tippoo ruled the Hindu state of Mysore, thanks to his late father's conquests, and was siding with the French.  Various fictional characters and actions have been created to provide a place for Private Sharpe.  The author has provided a map of Seringapatam, and his Historical Note at the end of the novel gives some of the actual history.  Some unknown person did end up with the Tippoo's jewels, enough to retire in considerable comfort.<br />Sharpe is ambitious and ends up a sergeant at a relatively young age.  He will also discover that trolls are difficult to kill, and tend to hang onto a person once they have found someone to torment.  Like most books in the Sharpe series, I would rate this novel PG-13 based on content.	2002-03-04

While not great literature, it is an interesting tale.  The events might seem unlikely in modern terms, but this was in 1761 when people in far-off colonies did not always follow the back-home rules.<br />Captain Adam Horne receives secret orders to kidnap a prisoner from England's own military forces.  The details of the plot have been used before, i.e., he recruits inmates from the prison in Bombay, takes them to a secret base for training, and lets the convicts redeem themselves by carrying out a highly dangerous mission (does this sound like \\"the Dirty Dozen\\").  Captain Horne is in the Bombay Marines, an independent naval force of the East India Company which owes its loyalty to the company first and to England second (this was the company largely responsible for the American Revolution by putting the company's interests ahead of everything else).<br />The details of the plot are interesting and, perhaps, reflect the conditions of that time period, e.g., dangerous weather, a high death rate in overseas service, harsh discipline (the captain's word was law and people could be executed with no recourse to appeals), etc.  This was during one of the many wars between England and France.  The Bombay Marines fought the French, somewhat independently of the British Army and Navy, to give the East India Company domination and control of trade with India.  It was all about money.  The author provides a small map, and a short afterward with a few comments on the history of the time period.	2002-03-04

That led to warfare over claims and counter-claims.  The present novel is set during the time of King Edward III, as English armies are once again on the continent contending with the French.  The historical research is good, and the novel is well written.<br />The main character is a fictional English archer, William of Hookton, who joins the English army in France after people in his village are massacred by French raiders. He has two missions, to find and kill his father's murderer and to retrieve a religious relic stolen from his village church.<br />William initially finds himself in Brittany as part of the Earl of Northampton's campaign where he distinguishes himself at La Roche-Derien, but also makes an enemy and finds himself charged with murder. Fleeing his enemy and the murder charge, he eventually rejoins the Earl in Normandy, participates in the battle at Caen, is injured, recovers, rejoins the Earl again, and serves at the Battle of Cr&eacute;cy where the novel concludes.<br />Like Richard Sharpe, in other novels by the author, William has a succession of women in his life. Besides casual romps in the hay, there is a pretty young barmaid in Hookton who is carried off by the French raiders, a Breton girl who dies from a fever (only mentioned in passing), a French countess who throws him back into the pond when she catches a bigger fish, and finally the pretty illegitimate daughter of a French nobleman whose fate is left to a sequel (he still must find the man who killed both his own father and the family of the girl's father). There is ribald humor in the novel. In one scene in a tavern where there are two unattractive women, William tells another man that he is going to drink until one of the women becomes attractive - the other man looks at the women and tells him he will die if he drinks that much.<br />The novel is a good picture of the time period. Common people were sujected to murder, rape, robbery, and arson. The common soldiers considered it among their perquisites to steal valuables and have their way with any women in captured cities (that attitude continued well into the 19th century). It makes one think of modern events in the Balkans.<br />There were similarities between the Battle of Cr&eacute;cy in 1346 and the earlier Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. In both cases, the attacking army lost the battle when mounted knights charged headlong against a strong defensive line. The English lost at Bannockburn, but won at Cr&eacute;cy. Perhaps the English learned something from history.  Any ideas of chivalry went out the window at Cr&eacute;cy where enemy knights, barons, etc., had their throats cut rather than being held for ransom.<br />It should be noted that much of the warfare of that time period was between relatives. It did not always result in grudges. The Earl of Northampton's father (who was married to Edward II's sister) had rebelled against Edward II and was killed leading a charge against Harclay's forces at Boroughbridge in 1322, a better fate than that of his co-conspirators. The Earl of Northampton's wife, Elizabeth, was the daughter of Bartholomew de Badlesmere who was hanged by Edward II after Boroughbridge.

The setting is in India in 1803 and it covers a relatively short time period ending with the Battle of Assaye on September 23, 1803.  The Muslim armies from the northwest, reinforced by Arab mercenaries, have swept onto the plains of India with the intention of conquering the country. The Muslims have hired European mercenaries including British renegades.  The are opposed by the British Army and the East India Company sepoys under the combined command of Major General Wellesley.<br />The novel has considerable action including Muslim fanatics and British soldiers trained to march into enemy fire.  This was a time period when little quarter was given and wounded enemy were commonly bayoneted.  Victorious armies commonly plundered captured cities, robbed the enemy dead, and raped any women they found - the few perqs of a common soldier.  The population suffers as armies concerned with loot, personal advancement, feeding themselves, and more loot, roam the countryside like plagues of locusts.<br />Copyrighted in 1998, chronologically this novel is book 2 of the Richard Sharpe series.  Cornwell, like Forester, reached the end of the Napoleonic wars, then stepped back in time to cover the early career of his main character.  The novel starts with Richard Sharpe as a sergeant, being thrust back into action after spending the four years following the end of the previous novel (\\"Sharpe's Tiger\\") in a relatively quiet assignment.  Colonel McCandless, his acquaintance from previous action, drafts Sharpe's services for a special assignment.  Events lead Sharpe into making decisions about his future.  He must contend again with Sergeant Hakeswill, and a new woman enters Sharpe's life.  This is the novel where Sharpe steps up from the ranks.	2002-02-28

Mike Hammer is in Florida recovering from gunshot wounds when he is called back to New York to the bedside of a dying Army buddy, shot by a person unknown.  As he is dying, he reveals to Hammer that $89 billion of mob assets have been hidden (yes, that is billion with a \\"b\\").  He pulled a switcheroo on the Mafia, and is the only one who knows the location.  He gives a clue to Hammer as he dies.  Then the race is on.<br />Members of the mob want their ill-gotten gains returned (money is power).  Federal agents want it.  The police, of course, are interested.  Hammer is looking for both the loot and his friend's killer.  Making sense of the clues is a challenge - an urn of his buddy's ashes with a fake military i.d. number, an old rundown boat, and the man's house which has already been torn apart by the mob.  There are the usual Hammer type confrontations with some amount of violence and occasional dead bodies.<br />This is more loot than you can hide in a mattress.  Some rough calculations indicate a warehouse sized space would be needed.  So where is it, and if Hammer finds the loot will he be a good guy and turn it in?  Hmmm...  What would you do?	2002-02-23

The use of crimps was a common practice to supply crews for merchant ships (see Charles Tyng's \\"Before the Wind\\").  The Royal Navy used press gangs (see \\"John Nicol, Mariner\\"), but the British Army of that time period did not have authority to draft or press men.  Consequently, the less popular regiments resorted to crimps to supplement the efforts of their recruiting sergeants.  Up to the early 20th century, losses to disease were high in addition to battle casualties.  A constant supply of new recruits was necessary.<br />When replacements for the South Essex fail to arrive in Spain, Major Sharpe is sent back to England to investigate accompanied by Patrick Harper, recently promoted to Regimental Sergeant Major (RSM), and two junior officers.  This leads to the immediate problem of finding the missing Second Battalion of the South Essex.  Sharpe and Harper are old campaigners, rough individuals with many skills and willing to kill enemies - definitely not to be trifled with.  Finding the battalion is one thing, but getting the replacements to Spain is another matter.  Crimping has been carried to extreme heights involving highly placed people.  Trained companies are being sold to the highest bidder to fill the needs of other regiments.  Sharpe may be a skilled combat soldier, but he is not a diplomat and is unwilling to compromise. It helps to be a hero in favor with the Prince of Wales, but his real assistance comes from unexpected allies.<br />A side trip takes Sharpe into the St. Giles slum of his youth to dispose of a bagfull of diamonds acquired as spoils after the Battle of Vitoria.  This provides an interesting view of the underside of sociey where life is cheap, and some commentary on Sharpe's early beginnings.	2002-02-20

It is heavier reading than the average novel, and probably will not be popular fiction.  The story consists of a number of inter-related sub-plots, and skips between various characters and actions that are intertwined in a complex plot.  I would rate the novel as a tragedy where the black hats prevail.  It is the second novel in a series, but can be read as a stand alone book.<br />Other authors have included the smuggling trade between England and France in their plots, perhaps making it appear somewhat glamorous (see Parkinson's \\"The Devil to Pay,\\" or Pope's \\"Ramage & the Guillotine\\").  The present novel shows the dark side and is set in an earlier time period, possibly the mid-18th century.  White slavery was common, including both men and women sold into servitude in the American colonies (or possibly brothels in the case of young women).  People turned a blind eye to pedophilia or other evils.<br />The main character is William Bentley, a Royal Navy midshipman returning to active duty.  He is assigned to the press tender Biter, an aged collier under charter and under the command of an indifferent lieutenant.  He is drawn into the various sub-plots involving white slavery, smuggling, and murder, with some pedophilia added in.<br />England is at war with France, but trade must go on.  The free traders (smugglers) have tentacles reaching into the higher levels of society where it is all about money.  A code of silence stifles attempts to enforce the law, compounded by magistrates and others on the take.  The novel seems to be a bit unfinished, but the author may be planning a sequel.  I would give it an R rating based on violence and sexual content.	2002-02-19

The story is set in 1814 in Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries.  It is a good description of the conflicts between the British and Americans in that setting including the burning of Washington and the attack on Baltimore, although it seems to omit the British attack on Havre de Grace. Like some previous authors, this author has included helpful maps of the scenes of action.<br />The description of the small boat operations using sloops and gunboats is very detailed.  The author notes in his own &quot;Author's Note&quot; that he changed some locations, etc., from the real ones, although it is not clear why he did that.  Most locations are accurate, as are the real people who were involved and the major incidents.<br />The War of 1812 was a peculiar war that started because of slow communications, had various raids or other actions that served no military purpose, and neither side gained anything of substance except a mountain of debt to pay for the costs of the war. The Peace Treaty was signed in December 1814, but the last military action was on 30 June 1815, again because of slow communications. See &quot;The Lost Ships of the Royal Navy&quot; for details of British ships captured by the Americans in 1815 after the war had ended.	2002-02-08

The main problem I have with this novel is the continual jumping back and forth between scenes of action, sometimes without finishing action in progress. The author still seems to have a problem writing characters out of situations he has written them into.  He also sometimes has a tendency to write with an echo, repeating information he has already provided.<br />Overall, it is a somewhat interesting tale, covering about a year's time from late 1812 to late 1813 during the earlier stages of the War of 1812.  It involves action in North American waters aboard both privateers and U.S. Navy frigates, and some interesting aspects of that time period, including the active trade between New England and Canada while the countries were at war.<br />The author has a tendency to write characters out of the plot by noting that they were killed in the last battle, although the action itself may or may not be included.  Casualties in naval service were very high from battles, accidents (including shipwrecks), and disease.  It is unlikely, however, that privateers would have fought with each other as there was little profit in that.  C. Northcote Parkinson, in his novel \\"Devil to Pay,\\" describes the attitude of privateers in regard to profit.  Privateers and smugglers gave their first loyalty to money.<br />On an historical note, the War of 1812 was a war that should not have been fought.  Issues between the countries had been resolved at meetings in London, and dispatches were sent to the American government.  Before the dispatches arrived, the hawks in the U.S. Congress prevailed in passing a Declaration of War.  The war resulted in a large number of deaths and disabilities, and substantial losses to commerce and property.  The U.S. gained nothing of any substance.  That lesson seems to have been lost by later generations.<br />The autobiography of Charles Tyng, \\"Before the Wind,\\" starts at the end of the war and documents the re-emergence of U.S. maritime commerce following the war.ce of U.S. maritime commerce following the war.	2002-02-05

The author has trouble completing scenarios he creates. In some instances, the writing is clumsy. I have previously noted in reviews of books by other publishers that publishers should employ readers (people knowledgeable of the subject). This is another example of a book rushed into print without adequate proofing.<br />The book is three separate related novelettes. The first story features Isaac Biggs, captain of the foretop on the merchant bark Anne in 1810. It covers a time period of several days and deals with the problems and seamanship aboard the bark. There is a thieving third mate who intends to kill or injure Isaac. Having created this problem, the author extracts Isaac by having him pressed into service aboard an English frigate. No more is heard of the Anne or how the problems aboard were resolved.  An additional chapter could have closed out this tale.<br />The second part of the book is a story about service aboard the British frigate Orpheus from 1810 to 1812. Isaac Biggs is a maintopman and plays a supporting role. The action skips forward rather quickly from 1810 to 1812 when the Orpheus leads a small squadron against a French convoy. Here the writing goes off track. The Orpheus is attacking a French brig, almost wrecking it completely with a couple of broadsides; then the brig is fighting like a frigate; then they board the brig; then they take off the captured officers who seem to be the complement from a frigate, etc. The author seems to lose track of where he is in the storyline, and seemed to forget that a brig was a lieutenant's command with perhaps 40 to 50 in the crew, no significant number of marines, and perhaps 12 four-pounder popguns for its armament (the light structure of a brig could not take the recoil of heavy guns).  The story of the action against the French convoy is never completed, and the tale skips forward to a scene in a tavern in Nassau.<br />The third part of the book is about an American privateer commanded by Captain Smalley, formerly captain of the bark Anne. Isaac Biggs joins the tale at the midway point. Eventually Isaac is able to return to the United States. By placing three stories in the same book, the action becomes superficial at some points, jumping between points where action is very detailed. The repeated nautical commands for sail handling can get a bit tedious.ne in a tavern in Nassau.<br />The third part of the book is about an American privateer commanded by Captain Smalley, formerly captain of the bark Anne.

This novel (copyright 1999) steps back in time to 1803.  The setting is India, and Sharpe has just risen from the ranks to become a somewhat old ensign, resented by his new regiment (\\"you can put a saddle on a cart horse, but...\\").  The story opens with action against Mahrattas at Argaum, and ends with the siege of Gawilghur.<br />Sharpe is a poorly educated refuge from the streets and a foundling home, the son of a prostitute, who has found a home in the British Army.  He is a rough individual, willing to slit a man's throat, especially if the person has done him wrong.  He has limited luck with women and learns the meaning of \\"Never, never trust a woman.  You'll be sorry if you do.\\"  He had some luck acquiring jewels as his share of the spoils after a previous battle, but has trouble concealing them and hanging on to them.<br />Sharpe must contend with old enemies, such as Sergeant Obadiah Hakeswill, and some new enemies.  He is a good man to have on your side in a fight, and is admired by some officers for his accomplishments.  The novel has lots of action, considerable violence, but little sexual content.

The first, \\"The Guernseyman,\\" covered the beginning of his career in the Royal Navy. The next two, \\"Devil to Pay\\" and \\"The Fireship,\\" covered his service as a lieutenant. The present novel starts with his promotion to command the sloop Merlin in early 1799 after serving 16 years as a lieutenant. Some officers were promoted due to connections and influence (see Frederick Marryat's \\"Frank Mildmay or the Naval Officer\\"), some by surviving and being at the right place when someone was needed (see Frederick Hoffman's \\"A Sailor of King George\\"), and some like the fictional DeLancey or Forester's Horatio Hornblower for exceptional action against the enemy.<br />The Merlin is assigned to dreary convoy duty and carrying dispatches, but eventually sees action with the fleet at Malta in the capture of Valletta (see Showell Styles \\"The Malta Frigate\\" for more details about Malta). That is followed by further action and a brief meeting with Commander Lord Cochrane. DeLancey makes a side excursion which takes him to a slave market on the North African coast, before eventually arriving at Gibraltar in time for Rear Admiral Saumarez's attack against the combined French and Spanish fleets in July 1801 (a fictional account of that action will also be found in Patrick O'Brien's \\"Master and Commander,\\" where he has replaced the real life Cochrane with the fictional Aubrey).  Ordered home to England, DeLancey makes a detour for his own profit with some help from his old smuggler friend Sam Carter.<br />The cover illustration, for unknown reasons, shows what appears to be a single masted cutter which seems to play no part in the story. There are a few technical glitches. The sloop Merlin is described as having 121 men and 24 guns, but later is said to have 9 men in each gun crew.<br />As an added note, W. P.

This novel, first published in the U.S. in 1973, is not the best of the series, but it introduces the main character and chronicles his rise from volunteer to lieutenant.<br />Delancey is a young man from the Channel Islands, sailing to England to join an older relative in the merchantile business.  The outbreak of war has cut off trade with the American colonies and left many merchant seaman unemployed.  This is compounded by unscrupulous merchants taking advantage of the situation to cut wages.  Delancey is caught up in a demonstration/riot, ends up under arrest, and is impressed into the Royal Navy.  His education finds him a promotion to clerk, and eventually he becomes a midshipman. His naval service takes him across the Atlantic to New York with the British fleet, where he meets up with some related American loyalists.<br />Delancey finds himself on an assignment ashore, and is caught up in the corruption involving military suppliers and kickbacks.  This leads to his reassignment back to a ship, with a black mark against his name.  Much of the action takes place on land during the American Revolution. The plot follows Delancey's career from Liverpool to New York, to Charleston, back to Guernsey and Jersey, and on to Gibraltar. It provides interesting details of naval service including corruption in the dockyards. It also covers the Spanish siege of Gibraltar in 1782, where the novel ends.	2001-12-27

The reader finds himself in the middle of a scene in 1794 with no knowledge of preceding actions.  Richard Delancey is still a lieutenant - assigned to the Grafton, a hulk at permanent anchor, after some unexplained incident alluded to in the plot.  A temporary assignment takes him back to Guernsey and the coast of France, but he then finds himself on the beach again, unemployed with no prospects.<br />Being in the right place at the right time, Delancey receives the temporary command of a Revenue Service cutter.  His success leads to certain business interests offering him command of a privateer both in recognition of his abilities and as a means of removing him from the Revenue Service where he was a bit too successful.  This provides Delancey with some profit, but also leaves him shipwrecked on the French coast and attempting to escape through Spain, just as the Spanish are entering the war.  The remainder of the novel covers his flight through a hostile countryside, and action in Leon as he rejoins the Royal Navy.<br />The story is a mixture of action on land and at sea.  Delancey has some interesting interactions with smugglers.  Interaction with smugglers was also used in the plot of &quot;Ramage and the Guillotine&quot; by the late Dudley Pope.	2001-12-27

The author has invented history only casually related to real history. Overall, it is an interesting story but sometimes drags in long scenes which may seem peripheral to the main plot. Joan, the Fair Maid of Kent, puts in an appearance in a secondary role. It seems unlikely that Edward III would have had an illegitimate half-brother as his father, Edward II, was gay and not known to have mistresses. The real power behind the throne was the Black Prince's younger brother, John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster (events would eventually lead to the War of the Roses between the Houses of York and Lancaster).<br />The author oversimplifies the relationship between Joan, the Fair Maid of Kent, and Edward, the Black Prince, by calling them cousins. Joan's father, Edmund, was both a half brother of Edward II and a cousin of Edward II's wife, Isobel of France (who contrary to the motion picture, never had any contact with Wallace). A grand-daughter of Joan and Sir Thomas Holland would marry John Beaufort, a nephew of Edward the Black Prince, and a daughter of that marriage would later marry King James I of Scotland with descent to the present royal family.	2001-11-09

So what happens when a young crusader starts a newspaper to bring justice, especially when competing with a tabloid that provides entertainment?  Young William de Worde's chance encounter with a printing press turns his limited edition newsletter into a major business, but he soon discovers people may be more interested in peculiar shaped vegetables than in national politics.<br />This is another story set in Ankh-Morpork, a city of werewolves, vampires, trolls, zombies, ghouls, etc., where people can form strange alliances, and ragpickers can rise to wealth and social respectability.  Even Foul Ole Ron has a niche in the economy.  William's honesty only goes so far, and he is not beyond withholding evidence, a little kidnapping, bribery, etc.  The last chapter has some interesting comments about the judgement of Death.  Be careful what you ask for.	2001-11-09

In particular, it is during his invasion and conquest of Lombardy in the later 8th century.  His grandfather, Charles Martel (&quot;the Hammer&quot;), had defeated the Saracens near Poitiers in 732, and again near Narbonne in 737.  Charlemagne set out to create a Christian empire.  The novel skips back and forth between characters and locations as various subplots run in parallel.  It includes shape changers (wolf to man), spirits, church politics, petty kings and robber barons, and fratricide.  Sexual content and violence give the novel a PG-13 rating.<br />Charles Martel's son, Pepin the Short, himself descended from Clovis I, had married Big Footed Bertha, daughter of the Count of Laon, also a descendent from Clovis I.  He seized the throne from Childeric and formed an alliance between the Franks and the Pope. He was survived by two sons, Carloman II and Charlemagne. It was common practice during that time period to murder nephews in order to prevent rival claims on the throne (an alternative was to have them castrated or mutilated).  When Carloman died, his widow fled to Lombardy with her two young sons to protect them from their uncle, and that becomes one of the sub-plots.  History does not record what actually happened to the nephews other than the fact that they fell into Charlemagne's hands.  It is known that he later forced his oldest son, Pepin the Hunchback, to take vows and become a monk.<br />On an historical note, Charlemagne had at least 20 children by various wives and mistresses. It is known that Charlemagne's son Louis the Pious, King of France, later deposed his nephew Bernard, at that time King of the Lombards, and had Bernard's eyes burned out.	2001-09-29

What does a woman do when a time warp lands a spaceship in the adjoining woods, and the man of her dreams steps out? And how do you explain the live-in boyfriend to your parents? The novel is really two stories. The first, &quot;Time Was,&quot; is primarily about Libby and Caleb. The second, &quot;Times Change,&quot; is primarily about Libby's sister, Sunny, and Caleb's brother, Jacob. The long, descriptive romantic encounters drag the story out, making a longer novel out of what could have been a novelette. Readers may get the feeling of being voyeurs in someone's bedroom. One can wonder how the author conducted the background research for the novel. The sexual content gives the novel an R rating.	2001-09-19

It is written in a narative style. The main character is not fully identified by name until page 74 (part of the assumption that you have read the previous novels). Tony Whats-his-name from book one in the series reappears, along with other characters from previous books. There are numerous digressions, and a tendency to use foreign language terms.<br />The plot is a whodunit as various characters search for the lost Trojan gold that disappeared from Germany during the final days of World War II. In the chaos at the end of the war, many valuable items disappeared, apparently looted.  Now a story has emerged that the Trojan gold (artifacts that had been in a German museum) was carried to safety and hidden.  Many people have an interest, either for museums or for their own profit.<br />With two people murdered, and an assortment of people just happening to be on the scene, there are questions about some people's motives (other than the fact that several men are trying to seduce Vicky).  Vicky finds her life in danger, as various people follow clues in attempts to track down the gold.  There are indications that it had been hidden in a schrank (a type of wooden cabinet).  The good guys prevail over the bad guys, but the story leaves things unfinished and the schrank disassembled.	2001-09-17

While it may not be the best<br />book of the series, it should be read first as it establishes the characters.<br />The story finds university historical researcher Vicky Bliss in competition<br />with fellow faculty member, Tony Whats-his-name, to find a lost<br />carving.  The novel is written in a semi-narrative fashion, and it<br />takes a while for the narrator to be introduced by name.<br />The novel becomes a whodunit as the various characters search<br />Schloss Drachenstein seeking the lost carving.  Various secrets become<br />revealed as the plot moves towards a climax.  Different people have their<br />own agendas, and a little detective work reveals both the location of the<br />carving and the real story of its disappearance.

Ankh-Morpork and Klatch become involved in a dispute over ownership of the desolate island of Leshp which has risen from the sea.  It is a typical story of countries spending vast amounts of their resources in a dispute over a relatively worthless piece of real estate, with various people pursuing their own agendas and feathering their own nests as they appeal to patriotism.  With sailing ships, camels, a stolen (somewhat threadbare) flying carpet, and a submarine, the plot gets interesting.  The story is humorous, but various dead bodies are left about the landscape.	2001-09-09

Is there trickery, perhaps mass hallucinations, or has someone really raised the dead?<br />There are some sidelights about the Washington Redskins, and an argument about who was the best quarterback of all times.  Disagreement with Kate can give men a bad itch where gentlemen don't scratch.  Overall, it was good reading for a rainy evening.	2001-09-05

They range from humorous stories like &quot;Pate de Foie Gras,&quot; to actual murder mysteries such as  &quot;The Dust of Death.&quot;  In the murder mysteries, the guilty person is not always caught.  Victims sometimes set themselves up for the perfect crime.  Two of the  stories involve time travel.  Some of the stories are traditional science fiction, while others are standard mysteries involving a little science, e.g., &quot;What's in a Name.&quot;  The stories are all entertaining, with some unexpected twists.  Asimov had a tendency to occasionally include a horrid pun.	2001-07-27

It takes place after book two, &quot;The Robin &amp; the Kestrel.&quot;  It is desirable to read the earlier books first in order to understand the setting.  Contrary to the  advice of an earlier reviewer, you should not skip this book as it sets the stage for the following book. The king has outlawed street busking, causing the Free Bards and other  street musicians to become creative in finding places to perform.  By chance, Duke Arden of Kingsford is forming his own theatre company which  presents an opportunity for Raven, Magpie, and their friends.  However, an  unknown enemy is trying to use sorcery to destroy the theatrical production. Various heroes and villains emerge as the story progresses.  Lady Ardis,  Justiciary Mage from book one (&quot;The Lark and the Wren&quot;), is  reintroduced (she also appears later in &quot;Four and Twenty Blackbirds&quot;).  The story reaches a blazing climax as various people are brought  together by tragedy.	2001-07-21

It is actually the fourth book, following &quot;A Cast of Corbies&quot; and making references back to that novel. It is also incorrectly titled (Nightingale should be singular). The Gypsy Free Bard Nightingale is sent from Kingsford to Lyonarie to carry out an investigation of the problems in the kingdom. Hasperus and T'fyrr (from book one, &quot;The Lark and the Wren&quot;) are reintroduced. The story switches back and forth between T'fyrr and Nightingale, and eventually brings them together. The love affair between them is well written without being pornographic. Nightingale assumes a dual personality that takes her into both the lower servants' kitchen and the king's private apartment at the palace. She and T'fyrr become involved in court intrigue that places their lives in danger, but they have an assortment of allies. Events reach a climax as the main villain is exposed, but the novel somehow seems to lack an afterword. T'fyrr reappears in &quot;Four and Twenty Blackbirds,&quot; but Nightingale seems to fade away after this novel. Some reviewers have placed the following book, &quot;Four and Twenty Blackbirds,&quot; in the Free Bard series. While it uses some of the same characters and settings, that book is really not about the Free Bards.	2001-07-21

It is book two of the series, and both continues characters from  the previous book and introduces new characters that reappear in later books.  The series should be read in order. The book begins with Free Bard Kestrel (a.k.a. Jonny Brede) and his wife,  the gypsy Robin (a.k.a. Gwyna), traveling from Birnam in a gypsy wagon.  The first half of the book takes them through a series of adventures  that lead them to Gradford.  The second half deals with events in Gradford,  including the attempt of an evil priest to take over the city as a dictator (one  can recognize the usual historical process of scapegoats, strong-arm police,  a charismatic leader, etc.).  It describes the strategies used by the general  population to survive during such a reign, and has an eventual confrontation  between good and evil.

A contested  inheritance, a hostile business rivalry between her savior  and another sea captain, and a resident ghost all add to  the plot. Life is full of surprises, and Persis encounters her  share. Overall, it is a good, well written story. The author  does use some archaic terms from the time period.

The plot is analgous to the situation in England in the late 16th century.  Saros is nominally at peace with the hostile Linyati empire, while pirates from Saros plunder Linyati ships and cities.<br />Gareth Radnor, driven into the Saros capital of Ticao as a teenager when Linyati raiders destroy his town, is sent to sea after a youthful escapade antagonizes a powerful lord.  Events lead him into a position as captain of a pirate ship, the piracy being tolerated when it brings large revenues to the crown.  Raids on the Linyati uncover many secrets about the enemy and establish various allies (the enemy of my enemy is my friend).  Secrets are also revealed in Ticao.<br />Overall, it is an action filled novel that holds the reader's interest, with numerous battles and adventures, some on land and some on sea.  I would give it a PG-13 rating based on sex and violence contained in the story.	2001-07-09

They were reorganized into chronological order and published in the present book form in 1833.  The author was a businessman in Jamaica during  the time period of the story, and was familiar with both the area and the era.  The book is of some interest to people studying that segment of history. On the down side, the novel (in narrative form) is written in the fashion of that era, and the fashion required by Blackwood's.  It goes into excruciating details describing  everything the main character observes.  The story sometimes drags as Tom Cringle goes from one adventure to another. The main action takes place from roughly 1811, when Cringle was in his early naval career, to the point where he is promoted to commander and returns to England (possibly 1820 or so), and roughly corresponds to the time period when the author lived in Jamaica.  The story starts in European waters, but quickly shifts to the West Indies where Cringle deals with Americans, pirates, and slavers.  A considerable  portion of the account is spent on land.	2001-06-28

The first part of the novel introduces Rune (the Lark), the ... daughter of an innkeeper's second wife, who escapes from the inn to become a traveling musician and to try her luck at gaining admission to the Bardic Guild.  A series of  adventures brings her to an ill-fated trial with the Guild and her  introduction to the Free Bards.  Part of this was published  separately as a short story. The second part of the novel deals with the Free Bards, and travels with Talaysen (Master Wren) as a free bard.  Additional  characters are gradually introduced including a new apprentice with an unexpected background.  The novel is the first in the  series about the Free Bards, and sets the stage at the end for the following novel.  It is helpful to read the series of novels in the order written as characters from one novel reappear in following novels.	2001-06-26

This corresponds to the time period when the author was a midshipman and lieutenant in the Royal Navy.  The story is told in a narrative fashion by the main character, Frank Mildmay, and draws on the author's own experiences.<br />Readers looking for lots of naval action will be disappointed.  Much of the story is on land and deals with Mildmay's romantic involvements.  A large part of the &quot;at sea&quot; portion of the story concerns relationships between Mildmay and other individuals.  The story often digresses into philosophical thoughts.  It is apparent that the author was from an upper class family, and that he looked down on people from the &quot;lower classes&quot; who he considered poorly educated and not up to par, i.e., his social inferiors.  The rapid rise of Mildmay from lieutenant to commander was due to influence, which undoubtedly accounted for the author's own rapid promotion.<br />There is little naval action in the latter part of the novel as Mildmay becomes involved in a triangle between himself, his former mistress, and his future bride.  He heads downhill towards self-destruction, and the story becomes a tragedy, but Mildmay is redeemed at the end.	2001-06-15

Half the action takes place on shore in Malta.  The hero of the book has trouble keeping his pants zipped because of his infatuation with another man's wife.<br />The book provides more details on chasing (or avoiding) a woman than on handling a ship.  The author is short on technical details (hauling a gun to a cliff top takes half a paragraph) in contrast to an author like Dudley Pope (who goes into extreme detail on technical matters).<br />The novel does provide considerable details on the British capture of Malta.  The author, a naval commander who served in the Mediterranean during World War II, based the novel on real people, ships, and events.  A map of Malta and the surrounding area would have been helpful.	2001-06-05

Forester is best known for the series of novels about Horatio Hornblower, although he wrote many other good novels.  I consider this novel as the best in the Hornblower series, and it is the one that I have best remembered over the years.<br />I have always advised friends to include incidental skills in their resumes, even if they have no direct relationship to the job (who knows, a company may be looking for a shortstop for its softball team).  In Hornblower's case, he was an expert whist player.  As an unemployed Royal Navy lieutenant, struggling to survive, his skill at whist puts him in the right place at the right time, and he receives command of the Hotspur.<br />Forester never presents Hornblower as a Superman.  He has mathematical skills, is a good navigator, and has the courage to go forward to carry out assigned missions.  He also has the intelligence to see opportunities for action.  On the other side of the coin, he gets seasick, is tone deaf, speaks French with a horrible accent, has no particular luck with women (marrying a plain, lower class woman he feels some obligation to), and has no useful family connections.<br />In command of the Hotspur, he is inshore close to the enemy.  He becomes involved in various successful actions, but rewards tend to go to others.  He receives little prize money and leads a frugal life style.  When he acquires a new steward, he must inform him that his &quot;cabin stores&quot; are limited to some lobsters taken from a French fishing boat.<br />Hornblower does have the good luck to survive, often the main criteria for advancement in the Royal Navy.  He also is well regarded by senior officers, which could be a path to promotion.	2001-05-31

After preliminaries, the main action takes place at Martinique in the summer of 1804.  Ramage is sent to blockade the island and, in the process, fortifies the Diamond Rock (Hood's actual accomplishment that year).  Some of the writing goes into extreme detail (e.g., Pope's reconstruction of the probable means Hood used to place guns on top the rock), and some is larger than life, perhaps too much so (Ramage's action against a French convoy).  There are some editorial glitches, e.g., a statement that men would be excluded from sharing in prize money when earlier in the story they had participated in the action that captured a frigate.<br />On an historical note, the Diamond Rock was commissioned and carried on the Royal Navy books as a sloop.  It was surrendered to a French fleet in 1805 when the British crew on the rock ran out of water (see W. P. Gosset, &quot;The Lost Ships of the Royal Navy, 1793-1900&quot;).	2001-05-23

Them that asks no questions isn't told a lie. Watch the wall, my darling, while the Gentlemen go by!\\" (from Rudyard Kipling's \\"A Smuggler's Song\\"). The smuggling trade plays a major part in this novel - it is tolerated to a point because it supplies certain luxuries and is a means of handling agents and intelligence during wartime. Like his other novels, Pope relies on the reader's knowledge of history to determine the time setting. The novel seems to be between 1801 and 1805, as it is after the first Battle of Copenhagen and, as Admiral Lord Nelson is still alive, the story must be before 1805. A good guess might place the novel in the later part of 1801.  That leaves a major time gap between the end of the last novel in the series and the beginning of this novel.  Later novels in the series jump back to fill in spaces left blank by earlier novels, so it is difficult for the reader to get the novels in a proper chronological sequence.<br />The novel spans a period of two to three weeks. The story tends to go into fine detail and, at a couple of points, I found myself skimming forward. Actual naval action is limited. However, there is considerable detail on the smuggling operations between France and England (the smugglers' primary loyalty is to money), and on the so-called \\"justice system\\" of revolutionary France (which kept the guillotine busy).<br />Ramage is given a special mission inside France as a spy to obtain vital information. The Royal Navy was willing to tolerate unusual methods and breaches of the law as long as it produced results. The blame would be on Ramage if he failed.<br />Overall, the story is an interesting tale of intrigue.  Actual naval action is limited.	2001-05-20

Chapter three goes back to the Chungking Covenant, and Dillon is brought into the case somewhat belatedly.  It is an interesting case, but both the good guys and the bad guys bumble about a bit too much in circumstances where one slip could mean sudden death (dropping their guard, turning their back on a known enemy, etc.).  Some scenarios are repeated in other Sean Dillon tales.<br />Unlike James Bond, Dillon never seems to have much luck with women.  The story has considerable violence but very little sex. Overall, the book is worth reading for light fiction, especially if you are a Sean Dillon fan.  The action is fast paced, and never gets dull.	2001-05-07

While not great literature, it is an interesting tale in the swashbuckling tradition of years gone by.  The setting is in 1805-1808.  The hero rescues himself and others from various hazards and improbable situations.  He is, perhaps, a little too straight-laced, spurning the advances of a voluptuous native woman.<br />The agressive hero acquires a sidekick who faints at the sight of blood, and a Chinese cook who is a little more than that.  With various enemies, intrigues, battles, hazards at sea, etc., it never gets dull.  The native women match the description from &quot;The Journals of James Cook,&quot; i.e., naked and promiscuous.  There is enough sex, language, and violence to give it, at best, a PG-13 rating.  It will require some re-writing to make it into a reasonable length for a motion picture.	2001-05-03
2028495:US	52705209	R3S43FPPUV6J73	0750921099	924801039	The Life and Times of Horatio Hornblower	Books	5	27	29	N	Y	For Hornblower Fans	This is a reprint of the author's 1970 fictional biography of Horatio Hornblower.  C. S. Forester wrote the first five Hornblower novels in chronological order, starting with Hornblower's service as a Royal Navy captain in 1807 and continuing to 1815 when the war ended and most of the Royal Navy was laid up.  In the sixth book, he skipped back to cover the beginnings of Hornblower's career as a midshipman.  That point seems to have been lost to later authors like O'Brien (who invented ways to keep Aubrey at sea, rather than dropping back to cover his early beginnings).<br />Parkinson created this biography by placing the Forester novels in chronological order, and then adding in details to explain Hornblower's early life, his family, and his years in retirement. It is so well written it is difficult to classify the book as fiction.  The recent made-for-TV motion pictures on Hornblower have changed the details of the stories to a significant degree, but are generally following Hornblower's career (there was no Court Martial in Jamaica, only an inquiry, with the blame for Sawyer's death laid on the escaped Spanish prisoners, and no charge of anyone pushing him into the ship's hold).<br />Parkinson himself is an exceptionally good author of novels covering the Royal Navy of that time period.  I am pleased to see that those novels are now being reprinted.	2001-04-19

Other people might find sections of it dry reading.  The book is recommended for oceanography students as the 17th century voyages of exploration formed the basis for later oceanographic cruises.<br /><br />Cook's voyages carried scientific personnel of that time period, many of whom died from the harsh conditions along with members of the crews.  In addition to bad weather, there were diseases and hostile natives (including cannibals).  Extensive charting was carried out and, on the second voyage, the Board of Longitude supplied Cook with Larcum Kendall's copy of John Harrison's H4 watch for determining longitude.  Observations were made of prevailing winds, currents, temperature, and other things of scientific interest.<br /><br />Natives throughout the Pacific would go to great lengths to obtain iron, expecially axes, even prostituting their wives and daughters (willing or not).  Natives would attempt to steal items, if they could, leading to numerous confrontations including one in which a boat crew of the Adventure (the consort ship of the second voyage) were killed and eaten by the Maori natives of New Zealand.<br /><br />Cook's journal ended several weeks before his death.  The editor fills in details from journals of other people who were on the voyage, and speculates on the reason he was killed by the natives in Hawaii.<br /><br />The book includes maps of Cook's routes on his voyages.  It also has an index listing the names of the various individuals mentioned, with an indication of their positions on the voyages or their other positions if they were not active participants.  While the index mentions the later careers of a few individuals like William Bligh, it makes no mention of John Gore's career (he is listed in the Wikipedia as having died in 1790).	2001-04-05

The story has similarities to the Sharpe series and traces of Alan Lewrie. It would appear that his main research was reading novels. It is doubtful that the Royal Navy would have been overly concerned about a past court martial acquital (Peter Heywood, a midshipman from the H.M.S. Bounty, was convicted of mutiny, sentenced to hang, pardoned, and later became a rear admiral).  The Navy tolerated and even admired many rogues as long as they were successful (Admiral Lord Nelson had mistresses including the wife of Lord Hamilton).<br />While action in the book is interesting - the siege at Calvi, action against a French privateer, and a mission behind French lines - the details leave much to be desired.  The Epilogue goes off the track.  We are led to believe that, in a month's time, a wounded officer left behind French lines has already been transported across France, exchanged in a cartel at Calais, and word has magically reached the admiral in command at Corsica (this in 1794, when a healthy person traveling by express coach might have needed a week just to get across England).  We are further led to believe that Admiral Hotham, in less than a month, has already engaged the French fleet several times.  The author should do a little better research, both on timelines and technical details, and perhaps limit the side excursions in his stories.	2001-03-16

It is difficult to set an exact time period for the story.  Names like Frode were common in the Fourth century.<br />In trying to make the tale sound like sagas, the author has used a writing style that is somewhat archaic and filled with words and terms not familiar to the average reader, particularly in the first part of the book.  Also, Chapter 1 should have been a prologue.  Periodically in the tale, people pause to give long poetic speeches.  The latter part of the story steps back in time to set the scene with Hadding's daughter, and the timeline becomes somewhat tangled.  Giants and gods drift in and out of the story at various points.  The novel could have been aided by both a map (for readers unfamiliar with the area) and a glossary defining various words and terms.	2001-03-07

It is a complex fantasy that skips back and forth between characters, and there is one large jump forward in time.

The present book introduces Willadene, a bedraggled waif fostered to a distant cousin to work as a scullery maid in the cousin's inn. Her future prospects are scant, with the cousin wanting to give her in marriage to a bloated drunkard of evil character who frequents the inn - a typical medieval notion of an arranged marriage.  But Willadene's sensitivity, which makes her ill working in a tavern kitchen, turns out to be an asset to a dealer in herbs and cosmetics, and even more of an asset to the Duke's household.<br />Events carry Willadene into a grand and dangerous adventure.  The Duchy is infested with evil which must be rooted out.  She becomes involved with the Duke's daughter, the chancellor, a visiting prince, and &quot;the bat,&quot; as the story moves forward to an action filled climax.  The story seems to jump forward in a few spots, and switches between actions of different characters, but overall it's a good tale.	2001-02-19

I believe this one may be No. 11 in the series.  The previous novel, &quot;Under False Colours,&quot; ended in August 1810.  This novel, first published in 1992, skips forward and begins in August 1811, Drinkwater having been ill between novels.  He has command of the frigate Patrician and is off on a special mission to the Potomac with an ill-trained crew of pressed seamen and a problem first lieutenant.  The first 146 pages, ending in November 1811, deal with this mission and are more concerned with interpersonal relationships and philosophical discussions than with naval action.  At points, the story drags a bit.<br />Part 2 of the novel, the next hundred pages, picks up the story in March 1812 with Drinkwater on shore with his family and the Patrician being refitted (and other captains stealing men from his crew while he dawdles on shore).  There is considerable discussion of the politics and diplomacy of that time.  It presents the British side of the outbreak of the War of 1812.  Drinkwater receives orders to command a small squadron, and the story then skips forward to find him off the entrance to Chesapeake Bay in July 1812.  There is some additional material on interpersonal relationships and philosophy and, after a personal sortie into the bay, he leads the squadron into the South Atlantic to rendezvous with the East India convoy and fight a battle with American privateers.  The novel ends in March 1813.<br />The novel could have used better research.  Communications across the Atlantic were slow.  The Royal Navy schooner Whiting was captured when it arrived at Hampton Roads on 8 July 1812 with dispatches for the American government, not knowing war had been declared (see Gosset's, &quot;The Lost Ships of the Royal Navy&quot;).  Also, the promotion of Drinkwater's friend Sir Richard White to vice admiral seems to have been a bit overly rapid.  As with other authors, the characters seem to fade somewhat as they get older, a problem with writing too many novels with the same cast. I still feel that book two of the series, &quot;A King's Cutter,&quot; was the best.ith other authors, the characters seem to fade somewhat as they get older, a problem with writing too many novels with the same cast.

The late Dudley Pope, a protege of C. S. Forester, had first-hand experience at sea, and lived for an extended period in the West Indies.  His novels are well researched.  The individual Ramage novels cover shorter periods of time than those of some authors writing about this era.  While Pope did not provide specific dates, the action described (and the sequence from the first story) places the tale circa 1799.<br />Ramage, having lost the Triton during a hurricane, finds himself on a special assignment investigating the loss of Post Office packets.  The matter is serious enough to draw the attention of the British Cabinet.  Events involve the private ventures of officers and crews of the packets, illegal but winked at (merchant ship officers of that time period expected some space for private cargo - see Charles Tyng's &quot;Before the Wind&quot; - successful officers could earn enough from private trading to purchase their own ships).  Ramage turns up information that requires delicate handling, the type of information that could bring down the government.<br />Having come to the personal attention of Cabinet Ministers, one will have to read the following books in the series to see how Lieutenant Lord Ramage's naval career proceeds.	2001-02-03

I was pleased to find that a publisher has reprinted this book, first published in 1955.  It is an interesting and entertaining report about an assortment of places, and illustrates that some places are isolated enough (or no-account enough) or simply have traditional relationships such that big governments leave them alone.  They continue merrily on their way, sometimes oblivious to the world around them (sometimes involved and sometimes not). They range in size from tiny (the Sovereign and Military Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, Rhodes, and Malta which occupies a small space in the middle of Rome) to somewhat larger (like Sikkim) and have a variety of governments and relationships with adjoining countries.  Monaco, ruled by a prince, has its own membership in international organizations.  Sark is a feudal state that theoretically is a vassal fief to the Queen of England (the Duchess of Normandy).  The backgrounds of most of the places described are tangled in historical grants, purchases, treaties, etc.  Some might seem a good choice for people wanting to drop out of the modern rat race, but beware of local customs, laws, and taxes.	2001-01-16

Once again, the author skips forward.  Book four, &quot;The Bomb Vessel,&quot; ended in July 1801 after the First Battle of Copenhagen.  This book covers a relatively brief period from May to November 1803, falling into the tendency that Patrick O'Brien had in some of his later novels of putting a little too much action into too short a period of time (sometimes moving ships about the ocean at fantastic rates of speed).<br />At the beginning of this story, we find Drinkwater on the beach, recovering from a wound received between novels.  Admiral Jervis (now Earl St. Vincent and First Lord of the Admiralty) was known for promoting officers based on ability rather than interest, and he gives Drinkwater (now a commander) temporary command of the twenty-gun sloop Melusine after the ship's captain in incapacitated and resigns (why this would only be a temporary command is not entirely clear - Jervis had the authority to promote officers).<br />Action finds Drinkwater guarding a whaling fleet in the Greenland Sea, dealing with French privateers and English renegades, and seeking a French base.  There is considerable detail about the operation of the whaling fleet and the hazards involved in arctic whaling.  John Nicol, in his autobiography, gave a brief description of a voyage on a whaling ship to the Greenland Sea, and noted his resolution not to make another.<br />Like other novels in the series, characters in this novel carry over into the next.	2001-01-14

However, some patronage gets him the command of the bomb vessel, Virago, although still a lieutenant.  The early part of the story deals with the problems of manning and supplying the vessel, and getting ready for sea.  A last minute, unexpected addition to his crew is his brother, on the run from troubles.<br />The Virago joins the fleet bound for Copenhagen, and Drinkwater has the opportunity to distinguish himself at the first Battle of Copenhagen in April 1801.  On the personal side, he must deal with the problem of his brother who he has concealed among the crew under a false name, and a problem with his purser.  Drinkwater does eventually receive some unexpected petticoat influence in his favor.<br />The Battle of Copenhagen and the related politics are described in some detail.  Woodman provides useful maps and, as in other novels of the series, provides time periods at the top of each chapter.  This novel covers the time period from September 1800 to July 1801, a relatively brief period compared to earlier novels in the series.	2001-01-08

This story skips forward and begins with the Battle of Cape St. Vincent in early 1797.  Admiral Jervis is depicted out of character, praising Lewrie without promoting him.  Jervis had the authority to promote officers he approved of and would have immediately done so if he approved of Lewrie.  The real life Peter Puget received such a promotion from Jervis, even though he arrived after the battle (Puget was known from earlier accomplishments).<br />After a return to England to put the Jester into the dockyard, and a reconciliation between Lewrie and his father, the main part of this novel deals with the mutiny at the Nore after Lewrie is promoted and takes command of a frigate.  He is confronted by an old enemy he cannot identify, and a crew split between mutineers and loyal men.  The story contains little action at sea - when Lewrie is not on land, he is mainly aboard ship at anchor dealing with the mutineers.  A side issue arises when someone writes a poison pen letter revealing Lewrie's past indiscretions.  Overall, the novel is more about personalities than about naval action.  It covers a relatively short period of time in 1797.<br />For novels more action-filled, covering the same time period (including the mutiny), the reader is referred to Richard Woodman's, &quot;A King's Cutter,&quot; and C.

The story covers the period from 1779-1781, as the Royal Navy fights both the French and the Americans.  Unlike other authors, Richard Woodman is diligent in defining the time periods in his books.  The book gives a realistic account of a young midshipman, where Drinkwater's greatest enemies are aboard his own ship.  It is highly recommended that readers read the books in order as this first book in the series introduces characters who play substantial roles in later books.

In this story, Drinkwater is in command of the frigate Antigone on blockade duty in the English Channel, the Bay of Biscay, and along the Spanish coast.  It covers a time period from March 1804 to April 1806, and involves Drinkwater in Calder's action and in the Battle at Cape Trafalgar, although aboard a French ship in the latter action!  The book is well researched and covers details not found in run-of-the-mill history books.  It is highly recommended to readers studying this particular segment of history.  While the main plot can stand alone by itself, the book carries forward various characters from previous books, so it is helpful to have read the Drinkwater series in chronological order (I have been unable to find books 4 and 5 in the series from any source, but hopefully they will be reprinted).	2000-12-07

It provides an interesting story set in one of the far off areas of the war, not usually covered by other authors.  As in his other books, Richard Woodman provides a time period with each chapter heading.  This book covers the period from February 1798 to January 1800.  It is desirable to read the books in chronological order as this book reintroduces characters from both books 1 and 2 in the series. It gives a good account of the struggle for promotion and notes the effects of bedroom politics (an officer whose sister is the mistress of someone with connections can gain promotion through his sister's influence).  The story provides an accurate picture of natural hazards when sailing, hazards of warfare, and hazards to health a in tropical climate.  Enemies aboard ship continue to be a problem, almost deadly in Drinkwater's case.	2000-12-07

It is a good collection to add to any library.  Jack London (1876-1916) was born John Griffith Chaney to an unwed mother.  He is known to have associated with the rougher elements of society and went to Alaska in 1897 in the early stages of the gold rush, returning a year later broke and in ill health.  Most of his writing used the Yukon and Alaska as a setting, although some material is undoubtedly drawn from other sources as well.  The description of the town used in one of his short stories fits in well with what he would have observed during his stopover in my hometown in Washington State.  He is generally regarded as an author/adventurer, and his novels and short stories have endured the test of time, being as popular now as when they were written. Like many artists and writers, his life was somewhat short.	2000-11-18

This book is readily available in the United Kingdom.  Captain Pugwash is a short book (32 pages) with large type and good illustrations, mostly in black and white but some in color (I am looking at a UK edition).  The story is easily read to children, and is suitable for older children to read by themselves.  The story is about a somewhat inept pirate captain, his lazy crew, his cabin boy (Tom), and his enemy (Cut-throat Jake).	2000-11-11

The series started in 1975, considerably ahead of the Harry Potter series.  It is about a young student at Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches.  Mildred Hubble is a somewhat inept student, who counterbalances that with some amazing good luck.  Her problems are complicated by her cat, Tabby, that is afraid of flying and also afraid of mice.  This particular story has the students from her class off on an unexpected vacation at Gloom Castle.	2000-11-11

This historical novel, in a slightly earlier time frame, is set in and around Philadelphia after the Battle of Brandywine.  It is based on the British occupation of Philadelphia, and the various battles and skirmishes between the British Army and the American Army.  It provides a realistic account, using both real and fictional characters, including the army's brutality towards the enemy (killing wounded enemy soldiers), the army's brutality towards its own troops, and the general pillaging of civilian property.  There are a number of intertwined plots based on the actions and attitudes of different individuals.  The key players other than General Howe, his mistress Lizzie Loring, his brother Admiral Lord Howe, Captain Andre, etc., are the fictional British Army private Sam Gilpin and his commander Captain Vane; the 20-year old Philadelphian Jonathan Becket, his sister Mrs. Crowl, and his uncle Abel Becket; and the young rebel Caroline from across the river.  The plot drags a little at some points as the author establishes characters and situations, but overall is a good story.  The story deals with the seamier side of life, with conflicting romantic interests, various people out to feather their own nests, and considerable violence.  It is definitely not the type of whitewashed history you find in school textbooks.	2000-10-22

The quality varies from fast-paced action  to the long-winded writing style of Melville's &quot;Billy Budd&quot; which  can put a reader to sleep.  Both the title and the cover are misleading as  not all the stories are about men o'war.  Some stories are original to the  collection, and some have been previously published.  A few are extracted  episodes from longer books, and can leave the reader adrift, having walked  in on the middle of a longer story not knowing either the setting or the  cast of characters.<br />The stories are in chronological order, and the  collection should have ended with the next-to-last story which concerns the  Battle of Navarino in 1827, the last major sea battle between sailing  ships.  The last story does not belong in the collection (being about a  steam powered ram on the Mississippi River during the American Civil War).  The editor would have done better including one of the Dr. Dogbody short  stories.	2000-09-18

The action is  concentrated in a very short time period (less than two weeks) in the later  part of 1796, just before the British evacuation of Corsica.  Ramage  escapes from a sinking frigate, aids the escape of Italian refugees from  the French, and then deals with the aftermath of his actions.  There is a  final side action on the coast of Corsica involving the grounded frigate  Belette (W.P. Gosset, &quot;the Lost Ships of the Royal Navy,  1793-1900,&quot; lists the frigate Belette as &quot;burned at Ajaccio as  unserviceable&quot; on 20 October 1796, along with the frigate Poulette).  The action is, perhaps, a little too fast paced.  At points, the author  gets wrapped up in details of ship handling, but overall it is a good story  with a somewhat romantic ending.	2000-09-12

The death of King Arthur is generally placed in the period from 518 to 540 AD  (yes, there really was such a person, but only brief accounts remain.  At  least one of Arthur's sisters, or possibly two, are among my legendary  ancestors).  Merlin, Arthur's legendary teacher, would therefore have been  a child sometime in the later 5th century, after the invasion of the Saxons  which started in 429 AD according to St. Germanus.  The present story  includes some extraneous references which are out of place, e.g., St.  Columba died in 597 AD, well after Merlin's childhood.  The book starts out  in jumps, like the arthur is in a hurry to move on, with flashbacks to  explain what transpired.<br />Emrys (Merlin) eventually starts out at the age  of 12 to seek his origins.  Alice in Wonderland fell through a looking  glass into a strange kingdom.  Emrys is swallowed up by waves in the sea  and cast ashore in an equally strange kingdom.  He then has a series of  adventures as he crosses the kingdom to save it from evil.  The author has  borrowed some scenarios from other writers, which readers will probably  recognize.  The story has a surprising ending.<br />The story is written for  slightly older children, or adult readers, perhaps in the age range of  Harry Potter fans.	2000-09-06

Unlike most seamen in the Royal  Navy, John Nicol enlisted for the adventure, first serving at the age of 21  as a ship's cooper during the American Revolution, mostly in Canada and the  West Indies.  For the next 25 years he served on a large number of Royal  Navy and merchant ships.  He was present at some well known battles  including the victories by Admiral Jervis at Cape St. Vincent and Admiral  Nelson at Aboukir Bay.  In the merchant service, he went to China 3 times,  to Australia, Hawaii, the west coast of the Americas from Cape Horn to  Alaska, Brazil and Portugal, and to the West Indies.  He served aboard  whalers and sealers that took him to Greenland and the Falkland  Islands.<br />As noted by the editor, mortality rates among seamen at that  time could average 15 percent per year from disease, shipwrecks, accidents  aboard ship, or armed conflicts.  John Nicol was one of the minority who  survived to old age.  He had saved his money and would have been reasonably  well off ashore, but he married a cousin, and then abandoned a well paid  trade as a cooper to escape the Royal Navy press gangs after 1801 and stay  with his wife.  He was a widower living in poverty when offered the  opportunity to publish his story.<br />This is a well written account by a man  who had only a basic formal education.  I would highly recommend it as a  &quot;must read&quot; book for readers interested in naval and merchant  marine service of that time period.  The book contains many tidbits of  information not available elsewhere, including his recollections of female  convicts in the second fleet to sail for New South Wales.	2000-09-02

I am pleased to see that it is still available.  Most fables about dragons  picture them as dangerous beasts guarding treasure troves, but this dragon  is a different sort indeed - an erudite peaceful dragon that had hoped to  have a quiet retirement.  When a knight arrives to rid the neighborhood of  the dragon, he is invited in for tea, and discovers the dragon does not  wish to fight.  In the classic tale, &quot;Beowulf,&quot; the dragon was  provoked by someone stealing a piece of the treasure.  In this story, the  knight finds a quite different means to provoke the dragon into breathing  fire (after all, the knight's reputation is at stake). The story has an  unexpected ending.  The book is suitable for reading to single children or  groups of younger children, or for slightly older children (and sometimes  adults) to read for themselves.	2000-09-02

William Bligh published a full account in 1792 with the full title, &quot;A  Voyage to the South Sea Undertaken by Command of His Majesty for the  Purpose of Conveying the Bread-Fruit Tree to the West Indies in His  Majesty's Ship the Bounty Commanded by Lieutenant William Bligh and an  Account of the Mutiny on Board H.M.S. Bounty and the Subsequent Voyage of  Part of the Crew in the Ship's Boat, from Tofoa, One of the Friendly  Islands, to Timor, a Dutch Settlement in the East Indies.&quot;  That book  was republished in 1961 with a shortened title, &quot;The Mutiny on Board  H.M.S. Bounty.&quot;  I am sure that there are copies in various libraries  and private collections.  Nordhoff and Hall published a fictionalized  version, and that seemed to lead to a spate of books in the 1930's about  the life of Vice Admiral William Bligh.  The story is well known, and there  is little to add.  Bligh's problems came mainly from inexperience coupled  with his own brash way of addressing people.  He took command of the Bounty  at the age of 33, and it was his first command of a Royal Navy vessel.  Prior to that he had been a ship's master, with a very short period as a  lieutenant.  He was on his own far from the fleet. His skill as a navigator  saved the crew members in the ship's boat (although many died from illness  after reaching Batavia, a well known fever port).	2000-08-31

The story is set in August-September 1944.  A group of German naval officers and seamen,  stranded in Brazil, steal the aged 3-masted barkentine  &quot;Deutschland&quot; and, using false Swedish papers, set out on a  voyage from Belem, Brazil, in an attempt to reach Germany.  They have  unexpected passengers - a group of five German nuns from a nursing order  attempting to return home.  Their biggest danger is the weather as storms  batter the sailing vessel (they neglected the fact that September is the  peak season for Atlantic hurricanes).  The voyage becomes an epic battle  against the elements, and leads to heroism, sacrifice, tragedy, and  unexpected compassion.  I personally believe that this is one of Higgin's  best novels, if not the best.  There are some intertwined plots as events  come together to reach a final climax to the story.	2000-08-30

It is a  reprinting of a book first published many years ago, and precedes the books  published by more recent authors like O'Brien.  Lt. Ramage is a young Royal  Navy officer who uses intelligence and strategy rather than simply charging  in using brute force.  Identifying the pirates who have been seizing small  inter-island merchant ships is a challenge which Ramage proves capable of  dealing with.  Like most fiction writers, Pope ignores the main hazard of  service in the West Indies, i.e., disease.  It was not uncommon at that  time for a ship to lose half its crew to yellow fever (for an account of  real naval service in the West Indies during that time period see Frederick  Hoffman, &quot;A Sailor of King George&quot;).  It should be noted that the  mutiny of 1797 had two parts, one at Spithead (resolved peacefully), and  one at the Nore (which resulted in conflicts with the mutineers, and  eventually a number of hangings).  The mutiny is covered by C. Northcote  Parkinson in his novel, &quot;The Fireship.&quot;  Overall, this novel by  Dudley Pope is a well written Royal Navy adventure.  In this book, Pope  tends to concentrate on a particular action (after preliminaries) in  contrast to some of the more recent novels by other writers like O'Brien  (&quot;Master and Commander&quot;) or Woodman (&quot;A King's Cutter&quot;)  whose early books cover an extended period of time with many actions.	2000-08-28

It is well arranged and well illustrated.  People tend to forget that they all  have the same God.  If some of the book's contents were quoted without  noting the source, people might have difficulty identifying the religious  origin.  While the book is written for children, I would recommend it for  the entire family.  Perhaps it is time for people to consider that their  beliefs are not very different.  Perhaps children can learn to accept each  other, and the next generation can learn to coexist in peace.  One can  always hope for the best.	2000-08-27

Information from  other sources places individuals included in this tale in the late 5th or  early 6th century.  It was a time of major turmoil in Europe.  In addition  to the main story of Beowulf, there are references to various wars or  battles.  Storytellers tended to use a large amount of literary license to  embellish a tale, so it is part fact and part fiction.  It is possible to  guess at the nature of Grendel.  Heidrek of Jutland, from that time period,  was referred to as a werewolf.  Patricia Daniels Cornwell, in her book  &quot;Black Notice,&quot; describes the physical condition that would have  caused a person to be called a werewolf.  The story of Beowulf, like  other tales from that period, includes a dragon guarding a cache of  treasure.  The story of our legendary ancestor Sigurd, slayer of the dragon  Favne, includes a similar incident.  The practice of awarding rings,  which seems to be well established by the time period in this tale, appears  to have origins before recorded history, and the tradition has been passed  down to the present (e.g., Superbowl rings, etc.).	2000-08-22

As I used to point out to students,  population growth generates advances in civilization to support the  increased population, i.e., there are no longer enough warm caves and berry  bushes.  The author most certainly makes this case - population expanded  beyond the point where it could be maintained without significant changes.  The main emphasis of the book is on eastern Massachusetts.  It provides  a detailed look at the forces driving change, and the response of various  individuals that led to the establishment of an active international  merchantile trade and the industrialization of the area.  It goes beyond  that to make a good case for managing resources.  The potential hazard of  too many people for available resources is illustrated by a recent case  (occurring since the book's publication) where two men were on a sinking  fishing boat with only one life jacket - one man killed the other to obtain  possession of the life jacket.  In the final chapters, the author  considers climate change and speculates about the future.  It should be  noted that climate (and ecology) are never constant as climate goes through  cycles of warm and cold.  The future is probably more uncertain than the  author indicates.  It might also be noted that our present civilization  requires a warm climate.  Overall, the book is well written but  sometimes skips about between topics.  While not a complete history, it can  provide supplemental reading for students studying some aspects of United  States history (and possibly ecological sciences).	2000-08-01

His fictional accounts of Richard Delancey, Royal Navy, tend to be overlooked. I am pleased to see that they are now being reprinted.  There are a total of six, of which this novel (copyright 1975) is the third chronologically (see my Listmania list for the full series).<br /><br />In this particular novel Delancey is still a lieutenant without influence to help him obtain promotion.  Like the fictional Hornblower, he must rely on chance (surviving and being in the right place at the right time - see Frederick Hoffman's, \\"A Sailor of King George\\") and his own skills.  His assignments take him aboard several ships and involve him in the mutinies at Spithead and the Nore, the battle with the Dutch at Camperdown, and action on the Irish coast. The story (set in 1797-1798) is well researched, well written, and includes maps of the various places of action. The author provides a somewhat detailed look at the life of a British naval lieutenant, including various excursions ashore (Frederick Hoffman's autobiography notes the tendency to go ashore for socializing).<br /><br />The original publisher's printing quality was not the best, so it can be hoped that the reprint is an improvement. Of books in this genre, it is one of the more suitable for children, avoiding the graphic sex and violence used by some more recent authors. Richard Woodman's novel, \\"A King's Cutter,\\" is set in 1792 - 1797, covers some of the same events from a different perspective, and is also recommended for readers interested in that time period.	2000-07-25

The story is  interesting as the crews of the North Star and Solar Queen attempt to  exploit the mineral resources on the planet Hesprid IV.  It turns out not  to be a milk run as they encounter wretched weather, unexpected XTs,  stranded miners, and pirates.  The question is whether they can come out of  the venture with a profit.  The story is well developed and generally well  written. The authors have an annoying habit of sometimes switching back and  forth between using characters' first names and using their last names -  potentially confusing if a reader has not developed a rapport with the  characters.	2000-07-21

Both Aubrey and Maturin have time to develop romantic  interests, but a reversal of fortune leads them into some interesting and  unusual (and sometimes humorous) situations as they dodge creditors.  A  renewal of war with France sends them back to sea as they attempt to  restore Aubrey's fortunes.  The action is fast paced and holds the reader's  interest.  Although part of a series, the book can be read as a stand-alone  novel.  The story is well researched and fits into the historic period.  In  addition to naval action, it provides an interesting look at some of the  social and legal aspects of life in England during the early 19th century.	2000-07-20

The opening chapters make continual references to previous action.  The first half of the book develops the characters, and almost entirely  deals with interactions between individuals in a group.  The book starts  out slow-paced and it was difficult to hold my interest.  The team of  individuals finally arrives on an alien planet in Chapter 11, their mission  to travel back in time on the planet to attempt the rescue of another team  that has disappeared in the past, discover the origin of artifacts, etc.  The pace of the action picks up when they go back in time, and it becomes  hard to put the book down as they unravel the mystery of the planet and  determine the fate of the missing team.  They also encouter the paradox of  time travel, i.e., some things exist in the present because time travelers  from the present visited the past to create what is found in the present.	2000-07-18

It covers the  poet's Yukon period, but also World War I and Bohemian Paris.  Robert  Service's poems ranged from dark humor such as &quot;The Cremation of Sam  McGee,&quot; to sad and sentimental poems such as &quot;Muguet.&quot;  Some  of his poems addressed particular topics such as taxes  (&quot;Resentment&quot;), dieting (&quot;The Battle of the Bulge&quot;),  etc.  His collected poems are recommended for any age group.

It is not  a complete history.  It is a commentary on the social/economic/  political/religious development in the United States during the country's  first half century.  It was a time when people had been set loose from the  law's and restrictions of England.  The constitution's guarantee of freedom  of religion and other freedoms caused a splintering of the church into  various denominations, and a person could become a preacher simply by  declaring himself as such.  Likewise, people with a minimum of training (if  any) could hang out shingles as doctors, attorneys, and teachers.  Various  entrepreneurs flourished, some successful, some not, as people struck out  on their own to seek their fortunes.  Schools developed as people sought  education to improve their positions, and publishing boomed (partly because  of the education, partly because the newly affluent bought books, and  partly because of the freedom people had to publish their opinions).  The  author covers many aspects of the era including the split between north and  south, the prejudices against African-Americans, the rise of the Baptist  church, the rise of the temperance movement, and westward expansion of the  nation.  Many other aspects are only brushed over, such as the bloody  conflicts with native Americans on the frontiers.  The book barely touches  on the maritime activities that brought the United States into the  forefront of maritime nations (see Charles Tyng's autobiography,  &quot;Before the Wind,&quot; for an interesting account of that), and only  briefly mentions the War of 1812 which occurred during that period.  It is  not an easy reading book as the author seems wrapped up in rhetoric and  sometimes writes with an echo, i.e., repeating information or points  previously made.  The overly long introduction can leave a reader  glassy-eyed.he overly long introduction can leave a reader  glassy-eyed.	2000-07-05

It is an early book in what could be a promising new series of mysteries, introducing an  interesting cast of players.  The chief protagonist is J.W. Jackson, on a  medical retirement from the Boston police department, who lives on Martha's  Vineyard with his wife, two young children, and two cats.  He has the  opportunity to earn a little extra money by investigating the fires that  have destroyed some run-down summer rental units owned by a local attorney.  Events quickly become more complicated when a blues man, an old friend of  his late father, disappears the evening of one of the fires; and J.W.'s  investigation dredges up information on some individuals kinky sexual  preferences.  He also finds an unexpected ally.  The book is hard to put  down, but a length that is easy to read in an evening.  As a bonus, the  book contains three recipes.

It is a collection of four novelettes by master storytellers.  The first story, &quot;Galway Bay&quot; by Morgan Llywelan,  is a change of pace for readers familiar with her full length historical  novels.  It is set in modern times, and concerns a part-Irish woman on  vacation in Galway, Ireland, who encounters the underlying realities of  Irish folklore and discovers romance in an unexpected place.  The second  story, &quot;The Harpers's Daughter&quot; by Barbara Samuel, is set in  ancient Ireland and concerns Deirdre, destined to be the bride of a king,  but she loves another.  Expressed in Deirdre's thoughts (about other women  in the king's court), &quot;One of them, one day, would have the warrior  who'd snared her heart, while she would lie with the fat, old king.  It  wasn't fair.&quot;  Deirdre is cursed with extraordinary beauty that  creates uncontrolled lust in the minds of any men who see her.  Can she  find a refuge with the man she loves, and will magic protect them?  The  third and fourth stories deal with connections to the spirit world in an  ancient Irish setting.  The third, &quot;The Trysting Hour&quot; by Susan  Wiggs, is about a spirit that can assume a mortal man's shape, and who  desires a woman meant to be a king's wife.  Can he win her hand while he  prevents the king from consumating the marriage?  And is she really an  ordinary mortal woman?  The fourth, &quot;Rarer than a White Crow&quot; by  Roberta Gellis, has a man placed under a spell by a shape-changing witch  with her own agenda (which can only be guessed at).  People are at an  interface between the spirit world and the mortal world.  Angus must win  the hand of Caer and love her til the end of her days in order to be free  from the spell, but that is easier said than done. Can they thwart the real  agenda of the witch?  The book contains explicit sex and violence.

While a few characters are carried forward from the previous books, including Ardis, Duke Arden, the Haspur Visyr, etc., this  story has a new set of players.  The chief protagonist is Tal Rufen, a  police constable from Haldine investigation a string of mysterious and  brutal murders of poor female street musicians/singers (or would be  musicians) - murders committed by strangers that commit suicide, and murder  weapons that vanish. As he follows the string of murders, Tal's  investigation takes him to Kingsford and the High Bishop Justiciar Ardis.  This is the Kingsford following the fire (see &quot;A Cast of  Corbies&quot;).  Tal finds himself in a new position, carrying out  investigations for the church.  Tal and Ardis must appraise their feelings  for each other.  Events lead to a final confrontation between Tal and an  evil mage, living under a curse, who has a grudge against free bards and  Ardis.  The plot and characters are well developed to provide an  interesting tale, but somewhat on the dark side (tracking a serial killer).	2000-06-24

This novel is based on the life of Edyth, a grand-daughter of Lady Godiva and the wife of King Harold II, and is  written in a narrative text, i.e., a story as told by Edyth.  The writing  style may not appeal to all readers.  It is written from a woman's  viewpoint (example text - \\"Brothers are intended by God as a sort of  plague, like floods and locusts\\"), and is consistent with the position  of women in society at that time.  It was a time when women were used as  bargaining chips to arrange alliances.  A woman could be sent into a  marriage with a man she had never seen, and had to hope for the best.  If  she was lucky, she might get a husband who was young and handsome.  But he  might be old, ugly, and battle-scarred.  This was also a time when people  did not bathe on a regular basis, and many people had rotten teeth. Edyth  enters into her first marriage with Welsh Prince Griffith (Gruffydd) ap  Llywelyn, neither having seen the other, hoping for the best.  After  Griffith's betrayal and death at the hands of the Saxon English in 1063,  she becomes part of the spoils and is forced into a marriage with King  Harold II, a short-lived marriage as he was killed at Hastings in 1066.  The book seems historically accurate. It includes details of Welsh Law and  customs, and contrasts that with the Saxons. The author ends the book  immediately after the battle of Hastings and does not provide an afterward  to indicate what happened to the various people who survived (it is known  that Edyth's daughter, Nest, later married Osbern fitz Richard; that a  daughter of Harold II and his mistress, Edith Swan-Neck, later married  Grand Prince Vladimir II of Kiev; and that Edyth's brother, Edwin, married  a half-sister of Griffith and obtained a Welsh title in her right).

The book does not entirely stand alone, as it is necessary to have read other  books about Pern to establish the setting.  It does not always mesh  correctly with other books in the Pern series (for example, the gratuitous  mention of Thella in Chapter XVIII does not match the details in  &quot;Renegades of Pern&quot;).  The book is fast paced at some points, and  a little slow in others, with side digressions into different segments of  Robinton's personal life.  It is a good story if you want to fill in  additional details about Pern, including some of the inter-relationships  between people, and the development of some characters or incidents that  show up in other books which are later chronologically (although published  earlier).  Overall, the characters are well developed, including the  relationship between Robinton and his parents, and the various sub-plots  wind together well.	2000-06-19

They originally supplanted Portugal, and at one time the countries were even allies, but they came into open conflict  over the rights to the lucrative spice trade, at one time dominated by  Venice.  It perhaps illustrates how a small area can blaze into importance  for a brief period of history.  Today it is Kuwait and oil; 400 years ago  it was the Banda Islands and nutmeg, an area that has become so  insignificant today most people could not find it on a map (the author  includes helpful maps). In 1600, immense profits could be made from spices.  A cited example was a cargo of cloves purchased in the East Indies for  £3,000 and sold in London (circa 1605) for £36,000, at a time when a  working man might be paid £12 per year.  Nutmeg, highly valued at that  time, cost virtually nothing in the Banda Islands, the only place where the  trees could be found, and reached a value of £500 per ton in London.  This  is equivalent to a working man paying a week's wages for a pound of spice.  The extent of the profit is illustrated in the book - the Dutch traded  Manhattan Island, then the gateway to the Hudson River fur trade, for a  clear title to Run Island, the most insignificant of the Banda Islands.  The profits were retained by the merchants who financed the ships.  Very  little went to the merchant seamen who risked their lives, it not being  uncommon for 50 percent to die from disease during a voyage. The title of  the book is misleading as it covers much more than the nutmeg trade.  However, there is a focus on the Dutch attempt to completely control the  Banda Islands as well as the rest of the Spice Islands.  The book also  describes the attempts to find a Northeast or Northwest Passage through the  Arctic, the earliest attempt to set up an English trading post in India  (opposed by the Portuguese), and other contacts between Europe and the East  Indies.  The book seems a little disorganized, with events out of  chronological order and the accounts of Arctic expeditions and such stuck  in here and there, but overall is a good historical account.  The self  interest of various individuals, the lack of control over people far from  home and their governments, the attitudes and actions of people who found  themselves with absolute power and became petty dictators, and the  massacres and acts of piracy are well documented.ok seems a little disorganized, with events out of  chronological order and the accounts of Arctic expeditions and such stuck  in here and there, but overall is a good historical account.

When Laura's husband disappears without a  trace (even the IRS and FBI can't find him), her life starts to unravel as  she adds up the bills, encounters tax problems and frozen assets, and  discovers that she has no personal credit rating.  After 20 years of  marriage, she finds she never really knew her husband, and was unaware of  the real source of some of his income.  Various things are dredged up from  the past including the emotional abuse that some people endured as  children.  As Laura struggles to maintain her own career and business while  dealing with her family, an old friendship is lost but an old love is  rekindled.  It is a difficult book to put down when you get involved in the  plot.	2000-06-14

It is a thorough account of the events and alliances that led to  the war, the wrong impression the German government had of the probable  British reaction, the split in the British government over the question of  British involvement, and events leading other countries into the war.  It  was a case of miscalculations, bad judgement, and blunders that led nations  into a war that forever changed the world.  What the German government  thought would be a short war turned into the long war that destroyed  monarchies and empires, left the Kaiser in exile, and the Czar murdered  along with his family.  Ludendorff's copying Stonewall Jackson's tactics in  shifting an army to defeat the Russians at Tannenberg, Von Kluck's exposure  of his flank and the French and British failure to fully capitalize on the  error, and the British failure to prevent the German battle cruiser Goeben  and the light cruiser Breslau from entering the Dardanelles, are all  discussed in detail.

The book is an essential reference for readers interested in seafaring novels about the Royal Navy during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It is the biography of Rear Admiral Peter Puget, covering his entire naval career from the time he was a midshipman (starting at the age of 12 in 1778) serving in the West Indies during the American Revolution, to his final assignment as Naval Commissioner in India, with details of his final days in England, and some details on his children.<br />A large segment of the book deals with his service as second lieutenant aboard His Majesty's sloop Discovery under the command of George Vancouver during that ship's voyage to the northwest coast of North America (1791-1795). It gives some valuable insight into that voyage and the personality of Captain George Vancouver (Vancouver had served with Captain James Cook on both his second and third voyages). Lieutenant Puget was promoted to lieutenant at the age of 25 (see Richard Woodman's, \\"A King's Cutter,\\" for a story about the difficulties of a midshipman from the American Revolution struggling for promotion).<br />The voyage of the Discovery started out soon after the mutiny aboard the H.M.S. Bounty (see William Bligh, \\"The Mutiny Aboard the H.M.S. Bounty\\"), with the result that a consort, the armed tender Chatham under the command of Lieutenant William Robert Broughton, was sent to accompany the Discovery. George Vancouver and William Bligh had served together on Captain Cook's third voyage, Bligh being the sailing master. There is no doubt that the mutiny on the Bounty influenced Vancouver's attitudes towards his officers and men. Vancouver had also been present when the natives in Hawaii killed Captain Cook, and that undoubtedly colored his attitude towards native peoples.<br />Peter Puget was responsible for surveying and charting Puget Sound in what in now Washington State. He apparently made a good impression on Vancouver. When Broughton was send overland to carry dispatches back to England, Puget was given command of the Chatham, skipping over Lieutenant Mudge, the first lieutenant on the Discovery.<br />Puget participated in the capture of a Dutch East Indiaman during the return voyage to England in 1795 for which he received an unknown amount of prize money (records show the final account was not closed until 1834, when his widow received a small balance of one pound, 17 shillings, 6 pence). The balance of the book covers the remainder of his career, promotion to commander in command of a transport, service at Gibraltar, command of a flotilla of transports, command of a sloop, promotion to Captain by Admiral Jervis at Lisbon in 1797 and assignment to command of a Spanish ship of the line captured at Cape St. Vincent, and then service with the Home Fleet in command of various ships of the line. He commanded the in-shore squadron at the Battle of Copenhagen in 1807. He was appointed Commissioner of the Navy at Madras, India, in 1810, and continued in that position until 1817, among his duties overseeing construction of the dockyard at Trincomalee. He was forced to retire due to ill health in 1817, arriving back in England in early 1818, and never held another active command. He reached the top of the Captain's List in 1821 and was promoted to Rear Admiral of the Blue after 24 years as a captain. He died the following year at the age of 56, having never regained his health. The book gives a good account of naval service during that period of time, including accidents and illness, the hard life at sea, successes and failures. He had enough time on shore to father 7 sons and 4 daughters.apparently made a good impression on Vancouver.

It is a story set in 1701 colonial tidewater Virginia, at a time when piracy was a common problem.  To quote from David Stick in &quot;Graveyard of the Atlantic&quot; (Univ. of North  Carolina Press, 1952), &quot;There were pirates too - Blackbeard, Stede  Bonnet, Anne Bonny, and Calico Jack Rackam, to name a few - who  rendezvoused behind the isolated islands of the outer banks, sailed out  from there to attack merchant vessels, and returned again to celebrate and  fight over their loot and maybe bury some of it behind the ever-shifting  dunes.  Between them, the pirates were as much a menace for a time as the  winds and tides and shoals.&quot;  The writing starts out somewhat badly as  you seem to walk into the middle of a story without an introduction, and  the author apparently read a little too much Shakespeare as he uses some  archaic words and phrases (although that does not seem to continue through  the main part of the book).  As in other of his books, the author loses  track of details, e.g., he starts with a ball at the governor's mansion  (giving a good description of the present day restored mansion) and later  indicates that the mansion had not yet been built (where is his editor?).  Once things get moving, the plot carries along nicely and fits the context  of the time period.  Thomas Marlowe has created a new identity for himself  in Williamsburg, but his attraction to the widow Elizabeth Tinling brings  him into conflict with the powerful Wilkenson family.  Neither Marlowe nor  the Wilkensons are completely above board, both having shady dealings and  hidden resources, as their rivalry leads them to actions that would ruin an  ordinary honest person (the scenario about the tobacco was used by Ken  Follett in &quot;A Place Called Freedom&quot;).  Marlowe faces unexpected  danger when past associates show up on the scene.  Various people suffer  from the consequences of the resulting battle, but some people carry  potentially embarrassing knowledge with them to the grave.

Therefore the story moves back and forth between individual players who, from time to time, come together.  The story has a main plot about Captain  Biddlecomb, United States Navy, who is on assignment during the early years  of the American Revolution, this time to France with a chance to earn prize  money as well as carrying an important passenger.  Biddlecomb's commerce  raiding matches what historically took place during that time period.  A  sub-plot concerns Captain Hynson, an American who sought his fortune spying  for the British.  A lesser sub-plot concerns the activities of Ben Franklin  in his role as an American Commissioner to France. Overall, it is well  written, and some events follow real history.  However, the author tends to  leave loose ends (what happened to the crew of the Swallow, and how was a  captured Royal Navy brig sailed into a neutral French port?  What happened  to the money Biddlecomb personally received for the first two prizes?) and  sometimes forgets details from one point to the next (a ship's name CARVED  into a board, simply painted over to change the name).  Some sections of  plot seem to be a replay of ploys used by previous authors.  The book also  makes some presumption that the reader has read previous books in the  series, but generally includes enough information to fill in necessary  details.  The book has an American bias.	2000-06-02

He started as a ship's boy,  shortly after the end of the War of 1812 on a voyage to Canton, China;  rapidly rose to a ship's captain by his own initiative, family connections,  and matters of chance; and established his early fortune by the private  trading allowed to ships' captains, trading in things as exotic as live  monkeys, parrots, bird nests, and other commodities.  He had an eye for  potential profit.  The book details the harsh life of merchant sailors,  with miserly ship owners often giving them insufficient food and low pay  (if they did not try to steal even that), and bad treatment from some  sadistic ships' officers. Captain Tyng managed to become a ship owner at an  early age, and was a successful merchant brokering cargo by the time he was  31 (the ending point of the tale).  The last chapter covers a conflict in  Charleston, SC, between the State and the Federal Government about 30 years  before the Civil War when South Carolina passed the Nullification Act,  refusing to pay duties on imported goods, and President Jackson sent a  frigate to Charleston to enforce the customs and General Scott to restore  order in the city.  The book is the manuscript pretty much as written and  has a few flaws as a novel, e.g., excessive repetition of the phrase,  &quot;I can't remember his name,&quot; some repetition of descriptions, and  a lot of short digressions.  It is an interesting historical account  providing details of the U.S. merchant service during the early 19th  century including shipwrecks, pirates, mutinies, connivery, etc., as well  as extensive details of the merchantile business of that era when it was  possible to make large profits on a well placed investment.  There are some  side details such as the U.S. and British business of smuggling opium into  China.including shipwrecks, pirates, mutinies, connivery, etc., as well  as extensive details of the merchantile business of that era when it was  possible to make large profits on a well placed investment.

It is one of the earlier books in the series.  The case starts out  as a seemingly simply investigation into the background of a woman involved  with the son of a wealthy client of the firm.  Along the way there is a  murdered artist who had painted the woman's portrait, the emotionally  disturbed daughter of the artist, the son's ex-girlfriend from a topless  car wash, the ex-girlfriend's nude dancer friend, a suspect &quot;financial  advisor,&quot; and a host of other character's including some of Archie's  assortment of friends that carry forward from book to book.  There is also  the mysterious, untitled, missing painting.  Overall, an intriguing  whodunit, with a somewhat surprising ending.	2000-05-29

I would agree with a previous reviewer's comments about teachers assigning students to write their reviews directly to amazon.com.  Reviews should be collected by the teacher, graded, and at least edited  for grammar and spelling before being posted.  This book is not intended to  be light entertainment.  It is a complex plot about people caught up in the  U.S. Civil War.  The main character in the book is a man who has done his  bit, is in the hospital recovering from a wound, and decides to take  unauthorized leave to go home instead of being shipped back into the front  lines to fight someone else's war.  The book describes the seamier side of  a home front.  There are home guards who find it easier to bully and  terrorize their neighbors rather than risk their lives in actual service.  There are people who are persecuted because they don't support the war.  And there are people who are simply on the sidelines, sometimes getting  knocked about when they are caught up by events.  The main character in the  story makes a difficult journey home, sometimes caught in the middle  between the two sides, only to find himself in a final battle with the Home  Guards rampaging through the area.  It deals with harsh realities and is a  tragedy for many of the players.	2000-05-27

Some were fortunate and became owners of their own ships.  Others were crippled or lost as the  sea exacted its toll from those traveling its domains.  This book provides  a detailed account of shipwrecks on the Washington, Oregon, and California  coasts between 1550 and early 1962 (I am looking at a second edition).  Photos are included for some of the more recent shipwrecks.  It covers  wrecks caused by weather, poor navigation, collisions, or other  misadventures.  While copies may be hard to find, it is well worth  searching for as it provides an essential reference for those people  seeking information on nautical commerce along the U.S. Pacific coast.  It  gives a good overview of the hazards of going to sea.	2000-05-26
2460162:US	52705209	RLKETOGUHCNHN	0140440410	289712823	Anna Karenin	Books	5	1	6	N	N	One of the great classics by Russian authors	Anna Karenina is a long novel, but one must realize that it was originally written in installments and published as a serialized story. It might have been better as a TV mini-series rather than a full length motion picture.  Like most novels from Russia, I found it somewhat difficult to read, and it  should not be picked up on the assumption that it will be light reading.  Leo Tolstoy was from the nobility, and tended to write about the upper  classes of society, and a character in this book (as in other of his books)  will be found to have characteristics of the author, i.e., a desire to make  things better for the peasants on his estates, but having his efforts  undone by the bull-headed peasants who want to continue as they have always  done.  The book deals with the society of the upper classes in czarist  Russia of the late 19th century, in particular a woman who seeks love  outside her marriage.  It follows the woman's actions to her downfall and  death.  While the book is a tragedy for the main character, like other  Tolstoy novels it deals with a larger number of people over a period of  time.	2000-05-25

It details, chronologically, the Royal Navy ships lost between 1793 and 1900.  Perhaps not surprisingly most  ships were lost because of bad weather, poor navigation, or other  misadventures (fires, mutiny, etc.).  Besides the listing, there is a handy  index by ship name which allows the reader an easy reference to a  particular ship, and another index by geographic area.  It is interesting  to read, for example, of the fate of some of the ships captured at  Trafalgar, some of which were recaptured shortly afterwards by the Spanish.  I found that this book is a handy and interesting reference.  It also  provides brief details of the results of some of the court martials  following the losses.  The publishers printing job was not the best, as my  copy has three blank pages where it should cover the years from 1890 to  1900, but that was a minor problem.	2000-05-24

I have previously read number 10, but the U.S. publisher has not been reprinting the books in the order they were written.  To fully appreciate the book, you need to read the  previous books in the series. Otherwise you will feel at points as if you  have walked in on the middle of a story.  In this particular episode,  Drinkwater is off on a special mission to the Baltic, only to have his  orders changed via a message sent through diplomatic channels in Sweden,  and by the request of an agent picked up in Russia.  Things are complicated  by an unreliable lieutenant aboard the ship.  Events lead to the diversion  of a cargo of gold, and Drinkwater's participation in an intelligence  gathering operation.  One of Drinkwater's old enemies (from books 2 and 3)  is reintroduced.  Part of the plot seems a little contrived, but overall it  is an interesting story.	2000-05-24

This account by Captain Bligh was written shortly after his return to  England, and gives a very different picture of the situation.  It covers  both the voyage of the Bounty up until the time of the mutiny, the voyage  of the ship's boat to Java, and some information on his return to England.  It is accompanied by some biographical material on Captain Bligh.  While  admittedly his viewpoint is biased, it is a good account of service aboard  a Royal Navy ship far from home for an extended period of time, and the  various problems that can occur when the crew is tempted by easy living  ashore compared to the harsh discipline and hard work aboard ship.  His  voyage in the ship's boat to reach Java was a truly amazing feat, with the  loss of only one man due to an attack by natives.  Captain Bligh was  undoubtedly, whatever his faults, one of the great explorer/navigators of  that time period.  He was later elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.	2000-05-23

A man rising from the ranks of  farm laborers builds himself up to become a successful grain merchant and  leading citizen of the town.  Events of his past emerge to place a shadow  over his success, and his greed and some bad judgement lead to his ruin.  Like most of Hardy's books, it is a tragedy for the main character.	2000-05-23

This is really two stories, the first being about Hal Courtney and his four sons, and the second about further adventures of Tom and Dorian Courtney.  They are interesting stories with many details about the East India  Company, the East African slave trade, trade with the Arab world, and the  fratricide within Arab families as various individuals vied for power.  Part of the plot is based on the assumption that inheritance in 17th  century England automatically left the entire estate to the oldest son -  which is incorrect as individuals of that time period commonly prepared  wills making provisions for all children.  The author makes some errors  (such as a 17th century sailing ship traveling from Bombay to London in 62  days) which could have been easily avoided with a little better research.  The book has graphic details of both sex and torture (much of which is  extraneous to the main plot and could have been omitted).  Therefore, it is  not recommended for children.	2000-05-20

It is humorous light reading, with the tales set in the Cheerful Tortoise, as Dr. Dogbody, Royal Naval, meets  with old acquaintances and tells tales about how he lost his leg.  It  sometimes rambles a bit, as tales might if told by an old-timer  reminiscing.  Overall, it is a good collection of stories that could  probably be shared with children.  So get a pint of ale, and sit down in  front of the fire at the Cheerful Tortoise while Dr. Dogbody relates his  adventures.	2000-05-18

It is an historical account of events related to the war against German U-Boats in the Bay of Biscay and  the North Atlantic, with emphasis on the turning of the tide against the  German submarine service in May 1943.  It is well reseached but sometimes  digresses a little too much into minute detail.  It also skips around a  bit, and drops back to explain various developments.  It is a good account  for someone interested in the background details as well as the details of  various actions that took place.	2000-05-18

I personally found it an interesting account, from a woman's point of view, of the society of that time period with emphasis on the  Welsh princes.  It was the way things were, when people in power took what  they wanted, and women did not have a lot to say about running things.  It  branches off at the end, with the main character escaping from Wales (to  lead into another book).  As my descent comes down via the people who  stayed behind, it is doubtful I would be interested in the sequel.  I found  this book to be a good, well researched account, but it might be slow going  for someone just interested in reading a novel.	2000-05-16

It provides some insight into naval service of that era from the standpoint of an officer.  It has some failings in that it does not identify the time  from year to year, and sometimes leaves the reader wondering exactly where  the action is taking place.  It also reflects the biases of the writer who  comes across as a little self-centered and concerned with his own personal  comforts.  It is a little hard to sympathize with the writer's complaint  about being retired as a commander on half-pay, as that was probably about  five times the earnings of an ordinary working person and, as he relates in  the book, he tended to squander money when he had it. He also dawdled about  Paris for about 3 months after being released from captivity rather than  reporting back to the Admiralty.  Overall, the book is worth reading if one  wants to gain some insight into the realities of naval service, where  disease and accidents were often more life threatening than the enemy.	2000-05-13

The author did not seem to know how to end the tale, and continued from one misadventure to another.  The author  failed to keep all of his characters on the same time line, a problem when  an author does not outline things properly.  He also disposes of various  characters as if he is tired of them, or does not know what to do with  them, in order to introduce new characters.

Cockerel,&quot; which dealt with the British evacuation of Toulon in late 1793.  The book was  originally published in 1923, and just reissued in 1999.  It was the last  novel completed by Joseph Conrad.  It is the tale of the sailor, Peyrol,  but also of poor, mad Arlette, her parents murdered in the massacre in  Toulon after the British evacuation, who roams silently about, her shifting  eyes forever seeking someone.  The story starts in late 1796, after the  temporary British evacuation of the Mediterranean, with Peyrol's arrival in  Toulon in command of a prize ship.  After setting the stage for the story,  events jump forward to the 1803-1805 time period when Admiral Lord Nelson  was in command of a fleet blockading the port.  The story has a tendency to  shift from scene to scene, with some flashbacks in time that sometimes make  it a little difficult to follow the sequence of events, but overall it is  well written and a very good tale.  It is a shift from the usual naval  adventure, but fills in a part of the events taking place in that time  period.	2000-02-02

The main action is crammed into a few days.  One gets the impression that the author dashed this off to have yet another book for his publisher.  The  story is one of Irish tenants exploited by English landlords, at least some  of whom are attempting clearances to turn the land into pastures for their  sheep.  The story would have been better if it had spanned a little longer  time period, but it is passably good.	2000-01-29

This mission takes him to Helgoland and the Elbe River  during the winter of 1809-1810.  This book covers an interesting facet of  the war with Napolean's France.

The main problem is the author's refusal to allow the loss of a ship (and the main character's assignment to another ship).  The story starts with an improbable, larger-than-life, rescue of the ship  from where it was beached at the end of the previous novel.  Making things  too larger-than-life detracts from an otherwise good story.  It is a good  account of the creation of a fledgling navy.  The politics described were a  continuing problem for the young U.S. Navy for a long period of time, e.g.,  the appointment of officers based on connections rather than ability.	2000-01-25

It also makes the main characters bigger than life (too much so) and wraps together two plots, one  on land and one on sea.  The action at sea is a little sparse, and the  author has people on both sides performing what seem like miracles.  An  interesting piece of fiction, but I prefer historical novels that do not do  major rewrites of recent history.	2000-01-25

The Jack Aubrey character was based on Lord Cochrane (See \\"the Autobiography of a Seaman\\" by Admiral Lord Cochrane, republished in 2000). While the early books in the Jack Aubrey series were quite good, the quality deteriorated in the later books (where he was no longer taking plot material from Cochrane's autobiography), and the author lost all sense of time, trying to cram too many novels into a three year period from 1812-1815. He then invented various assignments to keep Aubrey at sea, instead of going back (like C. S. Forester did with Hornblower) to fill in Aubrey's early career. I skipped many of the later books. The present tale would have been quite good by itself, but the author rambles and digresses excessively. He also seems to change location in the middle of sentences, and skips forward leaving the reader wondering what happened in the intervening time interval. The later part of the novel, when Aubrey arrives in Chile, gets back into historical context, and the novel seems to be set in 1819 and following years - Charles Tyng, in his autobiography \\"Before the Wind,\\" relates his experiences in Chile during that time period, mentioning Lord Cochran and the presence of a British frigate. Bernard Cornwell's novel, \\"Sharpe's Devil\\" (copyright 1992) also covers the action in Chile. The present novel is OK for those O'Brien fans who want the final episode on Jack Aubrey, but it is not exactly a book which holds your attention.	2000-01-13

The  involuntary colonists, dropped down into a hostile environment, magically  accomplish things in weeks that would take normal people years.  This seems  to be another case of an author that has lost all sense of time (perhaps  bored with a slow pace and rushing to move on).

One woman's lust for power and position gradually  destroys her family.

Commander Lewrie takes Jester into the Adriatic  as part of a naval squadron sent to intercept French trade.  The book  provides a good account of the situation, including the troubles between  ethnic and religious groups in the area.  The present troubles in the  Balkans are taken back 200 years, with the Serbs as the villains, and  background material on some of the origins.  With graphic descriptions of  atrocities, this is not a children's book.  The account is interspersed  with details of Napoleon's campaigns in Italy and his rise to power.  An  old love of Lewrie's reappears, along with a couple of old school chums  from Harrow, and a new woman leads him into temptation while he is far from  home and family.	1999-02-28

The plot seems to ramble.  Without a prelude to explain the planet, the characteristics are left to be picked up in bits and pieces.  The author creates a planet  with essentially a 32 week year, but then forgets where he is on the  time-line.  A man leaves home for a few months, and then returns to find  his wife remarried with a child, a major evolutionary leap in 240 years.  There are far too many improbabilities (e.g., people don't visit, and are  not aware of, the next town, a bicycle ride away).  the main character  wanders, leaving various people behind, and the book seems to end without a  solid conclusion.  There are major gaps in the account in the later part of  the book after minute detail in the early part.  Perhaps the author plans a  sequel, but I doubt that I would buy such a sequel.	1999-02-22

Originally issued in 1988, it was written when  Lawrence Sanders was at the peak of his writing career (before he started  insulting his fans by cranking out pot boilers).  The stories concern  various intrigues on Wall Street - insider  trading, stock manipulation and  short selling, and corporate takeovers and greenmail.  The plots are well  developed and well written, and the characters are interesting.	1998-09-17

They go off on a quest to find a valley of ice that Naitachal has  heard an account of, and pick up an odd assortment of traveling companians  along the way.  The tale involves overcoming a dragon to win their way to  freedom.  Overall, a fair story to read.	1998-08-27

The young heroine survives many perils including a quest to  retrieve a magic shard.  This is really like two novels.  It takes the  first half of the book to create a situation which launches her on the  quest, most of the second half to cover the quest,  and has a short,  after-the-quest ending which can be pretty much anticipated.  The authors  seem to be a little casual of disposing of various groups of men in the  tale, and women would probably like the book better than men.	1998-08-21

Overall the book is quite good, but the authors do not fully develop a good description of the setting for the readers.  The orbiting Trade city, Exchange, is developed in pieces that never fully come together into a single picture.  Some references are made to information from previous books, but the story line stands alone very well as a separate novel. The crew of the Solar Queen has some interesting adventures on Exchange, and acquire a very interesting new crew member.  If you liked Andre Norton's previous books, you will definitely want to read this one.	1998-08-06

It is a cops and robbers type story involving higher class criminals and more sophisticated law enforcement, with only a minimum amount of spilled blood.  The story line is really a number of sub-plots that wrap together into an overall plot involving the inter-relationships of the bad guys and a complex sting operation by Federal and local authorities.  The novel is well developed and well worth reading.	1998-08-06

I personally did not think this book was as good as some of the previous books, but possibly I have just grown tired of some of the characters.  The lead-in is somewhat tedious as the plot develops slowly.  This story reminds me of talking to someone who has trouble getting to the point, i.e., the person you try to avoid at a party.  Sanders reuses a ploy used in a previous book, a shady investment advisor, although in this case it has a new twist. The book is written in first person and he seems to fill in a lot of space with minute details about the narrator.  The second half of the book develops at a faster pace, with less of the excruciating detail of what type of jam Archie uses on his toast, and it becomes a more readable book, but only after one has plowed through the first half.	1998-07-31

The main character, who's ambition is the freedom to go his own way, comes up against the class structure of the times and the limited rights of the working man. This develops into a superb tale as the hero encounters first the conditions of servitude and slavery in Scotland, then the conditions of repression in England, and finally the conditions of bondage in Virginia. While it is historical fiction, the book is especially recommended for readers delving into conditions that brought people to the American colonies.  Readers should be forewarned that the book has significant sexual content and some violence that would give it at best a PG-13 rating.	1998-07-28

The characters bumble around a little too much to give the book a five star rating, but it is a well written novel of modern times.  A secondary theme is the issue of academic freedom and the manipulations within a major research university.  Well worth reading.	1998-07-28

The White Ship disaster led to the civil war, but seems a bit peripheral to the main tale.  The book was well researched and presents a good picture of the disorder in England at that time, when individual nobels ravaged sections of the countryside with impunity as there was no strong central authority to contain them. This is actually a couple of plots, well intertwined, as the story covers the actions of the main players.  Good historical fiction which should be on everyone's reading list.	1998-07-28

Archy's specialty is carrying out investigations for his father when he is not carrying on with women and hanging out at the Pelican Club.  Lawrence Sanders was undoubtedly influenced by P. G. Wodehouse in creating this series, as Archy is a modern day counterpart of Bertie Wooster.  The plot of this particular book is somewhat transparent - that ploy of sealed caskets being shipped from one place to another has been used before.  However, the story and the characters are entertaining light reading as Archy introduces his erstwhile friend Binky Watrous into the world of private investigations.	1998-07-26

The rationale is somewhat slow to develop, and the plot seems to borrow heavily from the Day of the Jackal.  The story is filled with action, converging characters, and possibly too many dead bodies for reasons that are never totally clear.  The &quot;trained assassin&quot; seems a little too easily distracted by women he uses and casts aside, but this villain comes to a surprising end and the hero and heroine survive, although emotionally damaged.  The secret leader of the terroists leaves many tracks leading in his direction, but gets away clean.  Are these final events setting the reader up for a sequel?	1998-07-21

Set on an island in Puget Sound, it deals with a range of human conditions including prejudice, greed, jealousy and lust. The Japanese strawberry growers had peacefully coexisted with their neighors until December 1941. Then everyone's world was turned upside down. Japanese were driven into internment camps, property was seized, and young men of both white and Japanese descent went off to war. Now the war is over and people are rebuilding shattered lives when a fisherman from the community dies at sea. Was it an accident or murder? Fingers point at a Japanese fisherman involved in a dispute over land, and a pile of circumstantial evidence accumulates. The investigation exposes latent hostility towards the Japanese, and delves deeply into past events. The white newspaper editor, a childhood lover of the Japanese wife of the accused, is caught in a turmoil of emotions. Will he help the man who took the childhood sw! eatheart whom he still loves, or will he turn his back and walk away? The book deals with this and other moral and ethical issues. The novel was produced as a motion picture, and is probably available on video cassettes.	1998-07-21

For those with in interest in tall ships and the sailing navies, this novel covers a time period not well covered by other authors, i.e., the period between the American Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, when most of the British Navy was laid up out of service and pirates roamed the West Indies.  Lambdin does an excellent job researching the information for his novels.  While this book is one out of a series about the naval and amorous adventures of Alan Lewrie, the main plot stands alone and Lambdin fills in the reader with any incidental information on events from earlier books.  A highly recommended book for filling in that time period of history.	1998-07-21

Cockerel (Alan Lewrie)	Books	5	0	1	N	Y	Another true-to-life book covering an interesting era	It is 1793, and promotions have been slow with the bulk of the British Navy laid up between the wars. Alan Lewrie is still a lieutenant and, without a naval commission, living the life of a country squire with his wife and children.  But war breaks out with France, and Lewrie is called to arms, only to find himself with a thankless job in port until he wrangles a commission aboard a frigate with a less than competant captain.  Naval service takes him to the British intervention in Toulon, and once again Lambdin carries out some excellent research and covers events not well covered by other writers of historical novels.  This is a grand account of the events at Toulon, with a sidelight when the upstart Captain Bonaparte takes Lewrie's sword.  Events put temptation into Lewrie's path as beautiful and poor Phoebe is thrown into his arms during the evacuation.  Action against the enemy finally brings him promotion, but he must take a ship home for refitting, along with the ! young French refugee Sophie who knows all too much about Phoebe whom he has carefully left in Gibralter.  Can he trust Sophie's discretion when he leaves her in the care of his wife?  After all, she is French, and are they not more understanding about such matters?	1998-07-21

So off they go, with a surprising collection of her recent acquisitions, to find her accomodations in Corsica, Phoebe's homeland and Lewrie's next naval assignment.  Once again Lambdin has done excellent research to cover a segment of the early Napoleonic Wars that has been neglected by most authors.  The book develops as an excellent historical novel, mixing realistic accounts of well known historical figures with Lambdin's fictional characters.  And what of poor Phoebe?  The Contessa Aretino, a sharp businesswoman with a knack for turning a profit and a Corsican nationalist to boot?  Well, now... And Le Hideux, an enemy from Lewrie's past reappearing to match wits and guns, will this be his end as Lewrie hunts him down?  As with the other Lambdin books about Lewrie, the plot stands well by itself but, in this case, the previous book, H.M.S. Cockerel, should probably be read first as a King's Commander is an obvious continuation of a tale.  The ending of the tale is a little unfinished and leads into a necessary sequel.  Read Jester's Fortune for the continuation.	1998-07-21

The book would have been better except for two failings, it is apparently part of a continuing series and does not have a synopsis of what has gone before, and the authors fall into the habit of many science fiction/ fantasy writers of trying to create a new language.  In this case, the authors have created a language with names that cannot be pronounced.  It adds difficulty in reading when one continually runs into names of people or places that look like bltzpk'n.	1998-06-27

The book is historical fiction loosely based on Strongbow and his Irish wife, Aoife.  It is written in first person alternating between two narrators which requires, at times, keeping track of who is talking.  Considering the emphasis the book seems to place on wives and daughters, it completely neglects any mention of the daughter of Strongbow and Aoife who was the heiress who inherited his estates (he had no surviving sons). It is at odds, on various points, with conventional history and genealogy and is not recommended as a source.  Llywelyn could have done much better.	1998-06-26
