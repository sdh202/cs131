The pace of the novel fit perfectly.  Then I hit the jumble - the organized religion leads to hysteria in women, the strong aunt pays herself for her household duties, the males cause war (or are weak requiring women to prop them up), the lot of woman is bleak, the deaf-mute provides refuge, the \\"old Jew\\" provides recognition of one's social role ... all the (stereotypical)feminist complaints are introduced in quick order.  In this rush to stuff everything in, the development of the young Tora becomes unbelievable.  The narrative becomes didactic.<br /><br />However, the core of the narrative, a young sexual-abused outsider finding understanding of her \\"place\\" in her society and refusing to accept that place as fair, right, etc. is believable and thought-provoking.  As reader, I am interested in following Tora's story in subsequent volumes and in reading other works by Wassmo hoping the plot-muddle is a one-time flaw.	2005-08-23

This volume is a tirade against the Vienna art scene in the form of a monologue by a former member of the scene.  The style is a very repetitive, chain of consciousness approach - I'll never read the phrase \\"in the wing chair\\" again without laughing.  Not that the phrase is humorous in context - rather because  the phrase was so overused.  The result is a book that I could read only in \\"fits and starts.\\"<br /><br />However, Thomas Bernhard is excellent in choosing the details to build his characters; he is excellent in choosing the timing for disclosing background to the action.  And, the last portion of this single-paragraph novels is a delight to read.<br /><br />The book can be recommended for particular readers - fans of Bernhard or students of technique.	2005-08-19

Ignacio Padilla writes wonderful \\"fables\\" with themes of colonialism, politics, adventure, ethnic superiority, personal honor and life in general run amok - entertaining tales showing potential but not yet up to the quality of the masters (Pelevin, Calvino, Borges).<br /><br />However, if you want a chuckle on perfect health or minimal need for sleep Padilla will provoke both thought and laughter. My favorite image is that of paintings \\"quite simply wearing away from being looked at so much.\\"  Not even time is reliable in Rhodesia when settlers are afflicted with \\"nkalo.\\"  War becomes a calculation of odds - based on authentic vs. imitation weapons. Padilla's story worlds are inventive and amusing but not quite compelling in the manner of Borges or Pelevin.  Padilla is clearly an author worth watching in his development.	2005-08-13

However, the chapter \\"Bluesman Adam and Blueswoman Eve: A Theology for the Blues\\" alone make the book worth its cost.  Spencer presents an argument for considering blues as unchurched religion, complementary to  church music. One need only to love the blues for this chapter to provoke thought.<br /><br />At the other extreme \\"Isochronisms of Antistructure: Music in the Black Holiness-Pentecostal Testimony Service,\\" places the holiness-pentecostal music in the framework of Bruce Reed (The Dynamics of Religion), Martin Buber (I and Thou), Victor Turner (The Ritual Process) ... Because of the popularity of the Sacred Steel cd's, this essay is worth the effort required to understand Spencer's analysis.<br /><br />Historical essays on the ring-shout, spirituals, and gospel music provide a solid background for the music.

Monologues can be an effective approach to novels (Tabucchi, Hrabel,Tuck and Kolitz come to mind).  However, to be effective the reader needs to be sympathetic/empathetic to the speaker or the problem.  Unfortunately, for the first two-thirds of this novel Samuel Perlman was a bitter, uninteresting character.  However, the last third places Perlman's isolation/desolation into a broader existential, Jewish, Kabbalistic context.  Finally, his issues become issues of humanity - how to create a life, a persona to stave off desolation.<br /><br />The author provides a very consistent voice and a dry humor that makes the novel an enjoyable read.	2005-08-13

This technique adds a poignancy to the use of \\"Josef, Josef\\" for the old man (father).<br /><br />Memories and dreams are used effectively to provide the relevant history of the primary characters.  The choice of physical details and gestures are the author's strength.  At times, however, the choice of language in translation and inconsistencies in the text send this reader's mind on distracting side trips.<br /><br />This is a quite satisfactory novel.  However, there are so many better novels that I would recommend this only for those to whom the content - a death watch - has special meaning.	2005-07-30

The first, and best section, covers Evagrius, Macarius, Gregory of Nyssa, Maximus and Symeon the New Theologian.  It emphasizes the Jesus Prayer and the fundamental unity of body and soul.  This section includes numerous quotations from original source; they are well chosen and develop Meyendorff's thesis.<br /><br />The second section, which covers Gregory Palamas, presents his theology of energies vs. essence in an easy to understand way.  It relates his theology to the theological, political and philosophical issues of his day.  However, this expansion of focus beyond the monastic tradition has not had a firm foundation laid.  Thus much of this section requires significant outside knowledge to be meaningful.<br /><br />The third section covers hesychasm after Palamas - in very broad strokes. It emphasizes two developments best known to the West - the Philokalia and the Russian Way of the Pilgrim.<br /><br />The book provides a solid, readable introduction.  However, it has flaws.  Trivial production flaws includes typographical errors, lack of a bibliography, extensive illustrations without textual tie-ins ...  On the latter, the illustrations do relate to the text but what they are intended to add to the text is unclear.<br /><br />The book is also written in a defensive tone - brief comments against Islamic (Sufi) influence, Hindu nirvana, and, more extensively, Western humanism add nothing to the history of the Eastern tradition.  Nor are they explored sufficiently to serve as a meaningful sidebar.  (Also note that \\"nirvana\\" is usually associated with Buddhism and \\"samadhi\\" with Hinduism.)  Unfortunately, this defensiveness, creates for me a lack of trust in the reliability of the author, an author whom I respect highly based on other works.	2005-07-29

I was not disappointed - this is another excellent book on liturature and politics in the years surround Pinochet.<br /><br />Distant Star has the tone of a well told autobiography - the reader has to remind themself that this is fiction, compelling fiction that requires response.  The narrator of the story is not omniscient - rather after presenting an event, the narrator calls the veracity of the event into question.  In this way, the author provides a continuous narrative as experienced/pieced together by the narrator.  This reflects the way we fill in the gaps in real life and adds to the reader's sense of the reality of the story.<br /><br />The story includes three themes regarding the literary scene - the unreliability of literary criticism, the self-conscious choice of literary heroes by young poets, and the relationship between poetics and politics.  These are much the same as the themes in By Night in Chile.  The story follows a poet (leftist)following a fellow poet (rightist) over twenty some years - both literary and politically.  The leftist goes into exile; the rightest, after engaging in brutal executions, also, ends up in exile.  In a wonderfully ambiguous climax, their paths cross again.  As in real life, not all questions are answered, not all threads pulled together.	2005-07-28

Miller has a pleasant, conversational writing style that is a pleasure to read.<br /><br />What is wrong about this book? Let me list my primary complaints:<br /><br />1. The institution of church that he contrasts to \\"Christian spirituality\\" is nearly unfamilar - I know it only from one miserable year in an evangelical college.  While he may rightly flee from the church as he experienced it, he ignores that the Church was founded by God not man - splitting \\"Christianity\\" from \\"Christian spirituality\\" is an arrogant stance.<br /><br />2.  He uses words in a coded manner - \\"convicted\\" (apparently a Baptist usage), cool, and hippie carry very uncertain meaning in his usage. (And I am a member of the hippie generation!)<br /><br />3.  While he can justify the claim that Christians have the truth more fully than other religions, it is inappropriate to characterize Buddhism as rubbing the belly of the Buddha.  We can learn from the expressions of truth in other cultures and religions without compromising our Christian faith.  With a similar tone he labels Greek Orthodoxy as \\"exotic\\", assuming that it is exoticness rather than conviction of truth that leads some fundamentalist into Orthodoxy.<br /><br />4.  He confuses mystery with mysticism (or fails to distinguish between the two). Even reframing his discourse on mystery as mystery, he fails to distinguish between that which is beyond reason and that which contradicts reason.  Religious discourse belongs to the former but not to the later.<br /><br />5.  In his exploration of community, he ignores the tradition of hermits.  Discernment of communal life is missing in his narrative.<br /><br />6.  In his exploration of finances, he ignores the tradition of intentional poverty, stressing rather the rule of tithing.<br /><br />7.  He stresses the currently \\"cool\\" topics of social justice while ignoring the transformative imperative (God became man that man might become god.) In this more rule-bound understanding, he gives \\"repentance\\" as the key concept where I would place \\"conversion\\" ...<br /><br />I could go on.  Obviously, I am unimpressed with Miller as a role model for Christians.  However, his frank narrative of his story is refreshing.e\\" as the key concept where I would place \\"conversion\\" ... <br />I could go on.

True, the official story, that of a documentary on a house with (literally) a life of its own is more enjoyable if one recognizes its pseudo-academic nature.  True, the narrator's story in the footnotes is more enjoyable in the context of the beat and funk \\"biographies\\" that proceed it.  But anyone with an interest in horror-suspense or in experimental literature, can enjoy this literary romp in horror.

The plot, though complex, is well conceived although not entirely convincing.  Language is smooth and well-chosen.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the author choses to set the story up as feminist, fecund \\"female\\" old religion against male-dominated, hysterical, manipulative organized religion.  To achieve this, the author turns several potentially interesting characters into sterotypes and/or charicatures. The \\"bad guy\\" was born out of wedlock, educated and abused in a monastery and developed into a charming, debonnier, vengful villiam.  The \\"good guy\\" was also born out of wedlock but to a loving traveling performer; she develops into an herbalist, loving mother, and unbelieving nun.  Of course, the \\"good guy\\" and the \\"bad guy\\" have a past together, current incompatible plots, and a future together.  The nuns are all suckers, the men all power mad.

This riveting book with its complex yet believable plot is one of the best studies in the nature of sin, guilt and believe one can read.  From the bigger-than-life father to whom sin at its root is lies, to the son's guilt based on cowardice, to the servants' quiet display of self-confident, natural morality/dignity this novel shows the sin-guilt-belief problem to be universal.  In this novel it is played out in an Islamic/Afghani/American stage - the uncommon Afghani backdrop while particularizing the specifics of the story, only adds to the recognition that the problem is universal.  Consider this a must read novel.	2005-06-30

This history is painted in broad strokes using representative figures to represent the various eras of musical style.  Kavanaugh provides recommendations for listening - recommendations that are accessible to the interested reader.  One needs neither theological or musical background to appreciate the book or the recommended music.<br /><br />Even recognizing the need to be selective, however, I have one objection to the book's selectivity.  By failing to discuss the popular religious music of the medieval and renaissance periods - for example the pilgrimage songs - the book implies a shift in sacred music with the rise of Protestant hymnody and the gospel song without recognizing its antecedents.  With this reservation, I recommend this volume as a solid introduction to sacred music.	2005-06-24

However, the greater value of this volume is the careful notes on performance that are provided for the chants.  These notes are otherwise available only if you have a superb chant instructor - something many of us do not have access to.

The second half is the meeting of the now grown woman with the one surviving murderer.  What sets Baricco's handling of the plot apart from many authors is the surprising depth in his understanding of the psychological effect on his particular character.  Her behavior is unexpected yet perfectly congruent with her personality.  This raises the book from polemic into a fascinating study of human nature.  It is well worth the short time it takes to read.	2005-05-22

This telling shows that they approached discovering the true history of tangrams in the same manner they would approach any other puzzle.  The result is a book that is \\"a fun read.\\"<br /><br />However, frequently the book left me wanting more.

Piece shapes and sample puzzles are not given for all of these.  Samples of beautiful pictoral sets of faces, buildings ... are given leaving me wanting even more samples and frustrated at the occasionally overlapping pictures or small size.

It was revised again in the 50's and eventually published - in defference to its historical important I presume.  The novel is worthy of its rejection.  It is similar to D. H. Lawrence's The Man Who Died in its presenting the death and resurrection of Jesus as a trick played with drugs - a denial of the miraculous in keeping with its era.  Its feminism is based on an attempted renewal of classical religious images - Egyptian, Greek, Mithraic, ... - with a superficial presentation of these religions in a high didactic style and plot.  Even fans of H.D. will be disappointed.  Nonetheless, it does provide background for a greater appreciation of the environment in which it was written and of the development of H.D. thought.<br /><br />Read it as literary history and it is useful; read it as novel and it leaves much to be desired.	2004-12-27

His comments about sexuality and religion ignored the Buddhist tantric tradition of Tibet, his discussion of St. Augustine ignored Augustine's \\"God became man that man might become God,\\" he accepts the questional premise of the feminine goddess preceding the masculine god as universal ... However, this \\"imprecision\\" is a strength in this book.  The book is a personal account of an individual's working through of issues regarding religious institutions, spirituality and dogma through his exploration of monasticism in the Zen Buddhist and Latin Rite Catholic traditions.  It is not the work of a religious scholar - historian, theologian or spiritual director.<br /><br />The issues for Fenton Johnson revolve most strongly around the issues of sexuality, sexual abuse, discrimination by gender or sexual preference ... What is most impressive about his account, is the gradual change in his questions - as his questions become better formulated, tentative answers begin to form.  In these questions and answers, the author recognizes the similarity of the religious journey as experienced through different paths.  He learns to question and address his anger towards the institutional Catholic Church.<br /><br />The end of the journey as reported at the end of this volume implies significant room for and capacity to further modifications of his view.  I would readily recommend this book to individual's seeking a role for faith in their lives.  Fenton Johnson's account of his personal search should encourage others to recognize that in their struggle and skepticism they are not alone, that there are at least partial answers available if they learn to frame their questions appropriately.	2004-12-26

This is a novel that almost invites a study of its references and techniques, to the point one may gloss over the universal aspects of the story.  While the novel is deliberately Chilean, the motifs of professional and ethical social climbing and compromising are universal.  A young priest is \\"seduced\\" by the opportunity to be in the best literary circles - seduced into support of the right wing side of the Church and of politics.  This volume is his own telling of his story, near the end of his life, in an attempt to excuse/explain/confess his choices throughout his life.  The author's brilliance is in his compact telling of a universal condition in the very specific details of a particular life in a particular time.	2004-11-29

His use of language is best described as \\"controlled explosions\\" of language.  Where the words are copious and where scant is a distinctive trait/technique of his writing.  A sampling of the subject matter:<br /><br />\\"Eurydice's Homecoming\\" is a meditation by Eurydice in which she comes to understand why her husband turned back.<br /><br />\\"The Visions of Basil\\" explores a world in which manuscripts have been sent to Mt. Athos to be preserved ... an Basil's response when his precious collection is endangered.<br /><br />\\"Two Nights in the Life of Ferdinand I\\" presents the nights of 25 April 1824 and 3 January 1825.  On the former he is concerned with the death of Nelson and a construction worker; on the latter, his own death.<br /><br />\\"Sob-Stuff from a Sleeping-car\\" is a prayer to God by one ready to embrace death as the appropriate culimnation of life.<br /><br />\\"A Keeper of Ruins\\" reviews the life of one who guards the useless - a decomissioned ammo site, a lighthouse guiding no one, an auto junk yard ...<br /><br />The range of the material is impressive.

Why does this fact begin my review? Simply because both are essays on The Book of Questions rather than Jabes' poetry.  The book actually contains only ten poems from I Build My Dwelling (Collected Poems 1943-1957) and four poems from Of the Two Hands (1976-1979).  In other words, the volume is less \\"The Selected Poems of Edmond Jabes\\" than essays on Jabes' prose work The Book of Questions.<br /><br />Three of the poems stand out. \\"Slumber Inn\\" is built around a repeating stanza \\"With the daggers I / pilfered from an angel / I build my dwelling\\".  As the poem progresses the stanza merges into longer stanzas; the merging eventually shortens to \\"I build my dwelling.\\" The surrealistic images include true innovations \\"Trimmer of the sphinx's nails\\" or \\"You will come back on the day that frogs and thrushes / free the air from the grass you lie stretched out in ...\\" Jabes succeeds in uniting diverse images into a cohesive poem through the repeition.<br /><br />\\"Sunland\\" while less striking in its images successfully uses a phrase that initially adds a noun at each repetition then reverses an drops a noun at each repetition.  At it's longest it is \\"My love a country a town a room a bed a dead man a roof.\\" On this framework, Jabes builds a poem of love and absence.<br /><br />Finally, from the later poems comes \\"Those From Whom\\" - a poem that in style is very similar to The Book of Questions.  It is, a suspect, what readers would expect Jabes' poetry to be - conscious use of white space, parenthetical phrases, aphorisms ...<br /><br />It should be mentioned that the poems are given both in the original French and the English translation and that Duncan's essay presumes familarity with French.<br /><br />The book is a treat for Jabes fans but I would hesitate to recommend it for readers unfamilar with Jabes.	2004-08-27

The following sketches broaden the scope to an indictment of our culture with the normal concerns of my generation - Vietnam, environment, \\"aboriginal\\" rights, religion, etc.  While I share many of Lopez's concerns, I found the volume unsatisfying.<br /><br />First, the characters despite coming from different backgrounds and traveling different paths never develop distinct personalities.  Rather, all nine characters leaving their testimonies are drawn with the same strokes.  I could get more genuine differentiation by selecting nine of my friends - and get the same dissatisfaction with contemporary American culture and similar \\"exotic\\" rebellions against it.<br /><br />Second, the world-view, mind-set of the characters is so firmly set in the fallout of the 60's that the book never reaches the universality of the best fiction.  Nonetheless, it does maintain the usual high standard of prose I associate with Lopez.<br /><br />Finally, with the philosophical musings of the characters in their testimonies, the volume often slides into preaching rather than showing.  I much prefer Animal Farm's \\"all animals are equal but pigs are more equal\\" showing; the reader is less apt to argue back that the presentation of (Christianity, consumerism, divorce, activist art) is over simplified or biased.<br /><br />Nonetheless, if you are a fan of Lopez or of activist literature, this volume is worth a read.	2004-08-21

While is is comfortably safe, it encourages creative thinking regarding the meaning of the prayer.  It encourages engagement rather than mere repetition.<br /><br />Also on the \\"faith\\" side is his meditation on the Eucharist.  While this essay provides amusing, interesting autobiographical information and evokes an earlier (pre-Vatican II) age of American Catholicism, it fails to establish any separate identity - one can read several similar essays by other authors and the essay will simple dissolve into the familiar.<br /><br />Similarly, historical pieces such as \\"Hearing the Cry of the Poor: The Jesuit Martyrs of El Salvador\\" and \\"The Pilgrim: Saint Ignatius of Loyola\\" are competent but non-distictive historical essays.<br /><br />On the \\"fiction\\" side \\"The Wizard: Remembering John Gardner,\\" \\"Babette's Feast\\" and \\"Affliction and Grace: Religious Experience in the Poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins\\" are solid, thought-provoking analyses.  But again there is no scream demanding a rereading.<br /><br />In \\"The Story of Cain\\" where Hansen explores the story in Genesis and his relationship with his twin brother, Hansen finally achieves the promise of the subtitle.  Life, Holy Scripture and faith are merged into a cohesive whole and the cohesion attracts the reader's attention.<br /><br />Finally, the three initial essays, \\"Writing as Sacrament\\", \\"Faith and Fiction\\" and \\"What Stories Are and Why We Read Them\\" are solid though undistinctive mediations on faith and fiction.  For fans of Hansen, they provide insight into authorial intent/world-view while acknowledging that art, including literature, takes on a life of its own.s own.	2004-08-10

Thru stock characters - the bachelor farmer misfit, the promiscuous young mother, the bitter rectory housekeeper, the merchant with dreams for the dying town - a tale of failed hope and suicide plays out. Unfortunately, none of the characters are likeable; the book fails to engage the reader into the suspension of disbelief.<br /><br /> However, the author has some strong skills, most notably the ability to select the right details to depict a scene - the heavily varished logs at the site of the wedding reception being one example. The author also exhibits excellent control of the pacing of the plot. These skills are sufficiently developed to make it worth watching for another novel by Anthony Schmitz. He has the potential of getting it right.	2004-08-04

Rather, it depicts the relationship between a Norwegian mother and her son who works in Germany. The relationship is built on restraint and predictability - the son being obsessively patterned in his behavior. The mother, however, has one creative outlet - her garden. Into this garden she has allowed a young woman, the daughter of the owner of the local garden supply shop. The son both envies the young woman's relationship to his mother and her garden and dreams of &quot;courting&quot; (or at least engaging in meaningful conversation with) the young woman. However, the son remains trapped on the outside - of human relationships and of the garden.<br /><br /> Morazzoni has written this tale with such understatement that the reader is lulled into a sense of predictability, then jarred by the intrusions of the unpredictable. The result is the reader's sense of the book parallels the sense the son has of his position. This is a substantial authorial feat quite worthy of your time.	2004-08-04

Within five years, a farm kid like myself was familiar with him.  Obviously, he work immediately was recognized as exceptional, out of the ordinary ...  This slim volume provides an enjoyable reminder of his other works or a great introduction to the themes and style of Borges.<br />The volume begins with a handful of stories - the rewriting of Don Quixote, the imagined world, life as chance, spies and detectives.  All of which explore language, imagination, reality, labyrinth ... In all, Borges displays a broad education, mingling literature, psychology, philosophy, philology, the occult in a manner both entertaining and provocative.<br />The stories are followed by essays - a meditation on the Great Wall of China and the destruction of history, a consideration of precursors to Kafka with provocative ideas of how Kafka affects our reading of his precursors, Shakespeare and self-identity, Borges and self-identity.  In reading these, one is reminded how thin the line between essay and fiction is in the work of Borges.<br />Finally, the book closes with transcriptions of two speeches - one on dreams and nightmares, the other on blindness and the poet.<br />This wonderful selection provides a representative and varied introduction to Borges that is not to be missed.

The first two chapters are typical introductions to two aspects of Hebrew poetry - the techniques and the world view. As I read these I developed an image of the book as a typical college textbook introduction to the psalms with an occasional overzealous attention to detail.<br />My image was quickly proven to be wrong.  The two core chapters - &quot;The Psalmists' Journey to God in Jerusalem and the Temple&quot; and &quot;God's Journey to the Psalmist&quot; are excellent, innovative introductions to the themes of the psalms.  Smith's tying together of passages from the prophets and the Penteteuch is clear and brilliant. Among his insights are Jerusalem/Zion as paradise/Eden; God as storm and sun; the meaning of seeing God's face ... Smith pulls together interesting (fascinating, even) scholarly material and makes it very understandable to the average lay person.<br />The final chapter brings the psalms into the present. Here the attention moves to the interrelationship between our inner experience of God and the outer experience of nature.	2004-07-15

Most are prayers only in the sense of placing the meeting in the presence of God, of reminding participants of their place in God's work (and vice versa.)<br />The format is generally a few lines of introduction followed by a reading - many Scriptural, many from well-known poets, a few from Anthony deMello's stories, a few from the Oxford Book of Prayers (Tennyson, Wordsworth, Teasdale...) and a smattering of other sources.  Two prayers caught my attention as being unfamiliar and excellent: &quot;For the bread that we have eaten / For the wine that we have tasted ...&quot; from Contemporary Prayers for Public Worship and &quot;Come, Lord Jesus, come! / Let the day come, Lord, / when our misery / will find your mercy.&quot; from Archbishop Oscar Romero.<br />Prayers for the end of meetings follow the same format.  They are short and familiar. There are also Prayers in Anticipation of a Critical Meeting in a similar format.<br />While the core of the book is organized by month, in general that organization is contrived.  November and December being exceptions.  For most meetings one could easily select from any of the months.<br />For its intended use, this volume is very servicable.	2004-07-14

The intended audience is unclear - it begins with a recommendation to read a book in French ... a task not all of us are up to. In introducing the benefits of praying the psalms, Merton notes &quot;The words and thoughts of the Psalms spring not only from the unsearchable depts of God, but also from the inmost heart of the Church...&quot;<br />In discussing how we should pray the psalms, he notes &quot;But the subjective fruit of this divine and universal prayer, ... depends on how faithfully we make the sentiments of the Psalms our own.&quot;  In this discussion, Merton makes two statements that fix him in time.  First, he states that the father of a family should lead family prayer.  Second, his view of praying the psalms is monastic - focusing inward/God-ward - rather than lay  which is focused on the world and God. (See Charles E. Miller's Together in Prayer for a dicussion of the outward/apostolic focus.)<br />Merton's discussion on how to pray the psalms focuses on classifying the psalms: psalms delighting in the law of the Lord, psalms of luminous peace, psalms of the journey to the New Jerusalem ...<br />The strength of this book is the translation of the psalms that he uses - The Psalms, A Prayer Book published by the Benzinger Brothers, Inc.  It is also a book of interest to diehard Merton fans.  For others, there are better introductions to praying the psalms available.	2004-07-08

It is in his use of language and the intricate interweaving of stories, that Millhauser is inventive and original.  This first several chapters seem unrelated except by time and location.  One meets a 14 year old girl leaving a hot bedroom to escape angst. One meets dolls in an attic. One meets an unproductive 40 year old writer wanna be living in his mother's attic. One meets a mannnequin in a store window.  A group of teenage girls who get their kicks breaking into homes not to steal but for the adventure of it. A twenty year old woman. In tracing these, and others, throughout the night, the novel slowly shows interconnections that yield a picture of a full town, a town with the average range of people and dreams.  As Millhauser develops the interconnections, a reader may easily become distracted by the skill and ease with which it is done.  The plot is not sufficient for the suspension of disbelief to eradicate the interest of the craftsmanship.<br />Millhauser shows a poets comfort with using words as his raw media - the pace of the sentences' rhythm rises and falls with the tension in the scene.  The use of detail to create character is superb.  Now and then the freshness of an image or a word makes the reader stop and take note.  Yet the author sticks to the mundane - a partial roll of LifeSavers as thanks - in a way that makes the &quot;enchanted night&quot; somehow possible in every reader's experience.	2004-07-08

Miller encourages the participation of laity in the Liturgy of the Hours (Divine Office) by making the liturgy understandable and meaningful. He does so in a systematic manner while using plain language and humor to make his material available to a broad audience.<br />First, he stresses the need for communal prayer as well as private prayer. Both are truly prayer.  Communal prayer nourishes private prayer. In the Liturgy of the Hours, our communal prayer uses words inspired by the Holy Spirit (Biblical psalms and canticles) to pray with/beside the high priest Jesus. This gives the prayer an outward, other focus.<br />Second, he provides basic information regarding the psalms: their classification, orientation (who is speaking to whom), structure, imagery and interpretation in light of the life of Jesus Christ.<br />Third, he provides a view of praying the psalms in the person of another. He points out &quot;Because of our solidarity, there is no singular in authentic prayer.&quot; Thus he approaches Ps 88 in the person of babies threatened with abortion when he prays &quot;You have laid me in the depths of the tomb / ... You have taken away my friends / and made me hateful in their sight.  In the person of drug addicts, he prays: &quot;My life is on the brink of the grave / ... I have reached the end of my strength.&quot;<br />Next, he presents the basic structure and flavor of each of the Hours in the Liturgy of the Hours, suggesting practical ways to enter into the practice of their prayer gradually.  He provides very brief backgrounds for some of the psalms and most of the canticles. He also illustrates the flexibility of the Liturgy of the Hours in suggesting expansions of some canticles, use of the vigil extentions to the Office of Readings, etc.<br />Lastly, he presents a minimal description of how the Hours are to be celebrated, placing well chosen quotations from the General Instruction of the Liturgy of the Hours and the Constitution on the Liturgy in a separate chapter. He concludes with a 17 point summary of the book.<br />My only &quot;quarrel&quot; with the book is in his distinction between monastic and cathedral prayer.  Because his concern primarily is with travesties inflicted on the Liturgy of the Hours under the guise of &quot;cathedral prayer,&quot; he oversimplifies history, giving an unbalanced, misleading distinction.<br />This book provides a solid and inviting introduction to the Liturgy of the Hours.

Although Anne Carson was continuing her interesting use of language and her use of Keats quotations was brilliant, the volume lacked universality. It presented a courtship and marriage every dependent upon the particular individuals and their peculiarities.  The courtship and marriage of individuals unknown to the reader has limited interest.<br />Fortunately, through the remainder of the book, Anne Carson finally finds her voice for this book.  It becomes an interesting exploration of beauty especially beauty in the context of marriage.  In one brilliant chapter she gives quotations of elegiac couplets recording the view of a branch through her back kitchen window.  After a sampling of seasons, she closes with &quot;Well I won't bore you with the whole annal.  Point is, in total so far, 5820 elegiacs/ Which occupy 53 wirebound notebooks, / Piled on four shelves in the back kitchen. . .&quot;  She succeeds in painting a picture of a year's psychological response in a truly innovative manner.<br />Any author continually expanding their repetoire will make some missteps.

Not that I don't believe that diet and dietary supplements don't work - rather, that I don't have the tools to tell the crackpots from the serious researchers.  This book caught my attention for several reasons:<br />(1) its diet is not based on the USDA recommendations but rather on the food pyramid from Harvard, Asia and the Mediterranean diets.  To this it adds the 5 color fruit and vegetable recommendations and the glycemic load data.<br />(2)it uses scientific not ancedotal bases for its recommendations. For example, it notes that chromium has been shown to have a positive effect but only in those with a chromium deficiency.<br />(3)it adjusts it recommendations to fit the diabetes of an individual - type of diabetes, degree of current control of blood sugar levels and status regarding a variety of complications of the disease.<br />(4)it assumes that primary care is in the hands of a &quot;conventional doctor&quot; and may include medications, exercise and mental elements. In this context, it recommends more comprehensive monitoring of body chemicals than is the protocol for many doctors.<br />The overall result is a book that is well worth pursuing for what may be helpful to you as an individual as you make the life style changes necessary to live with the disease.	2004-07-03

I am generally a fan of Coleman Barks work; this book, however, was a disappointment. The jacket cover says of Michael Green &quot;is working to create a new kind of sacred art for our time.&quot;  This is an accurate description - he is still &quot;working&quot; with some successes and some failures.  The net result is that pursuing the volume's art, one is encouraged to explore further.<br />Coleman Barks' text interweaves Jellaludin Rumi, who is translated well, with Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, a contemporary Sufi teacher.  Unfortunately, Bawa Muhaiyaddeen does not fare well in the comparison. Bark's descriptions of personal experience and renderings of Bawa Muhaiyaddeen evoke thoughts of many of the South Asian &quot;mystics&quot; who arrived in the US in the late 60's and early 70's.  While there are teachers who impress me in under 16 pages, this teacher leaves me unimpressed in 140.<br />This book does have value in its explanation of the ritual prayer of the Muslim Sufi.  It deals well with the relationship between the physical and mental aspects of prayer. It raises some interesting questions regarding the relationship of revealed scripture (the Koran) and the interpretation of the scripture, especially mystical meaning.<br />The net result is a book that is interesting reading for the insights into the followers of a particular teacher, one easily representative of a class of teachers.  It shows both the spiritual needs and the &quot;leaps of faith&quot; taken to fill those needs.  In that, Coleman Barks has performed a service for us.	2004-07-03

This slim volume is well-described in the editorial reviews; I feel no need to repeat that information.  The strength of this novel is in its power to force reflection - on the nature of art (music in general, the role of the musician/conductor in particular), the relationship of human passion to art, and the relationship between man and woman.  The first switch in stories, from that of the conductor to the ice age lovers, leaves the reader momentarily baffled.  At the first return to the contemporary story, however, the interrelationships become clear.  Thereafter, the structure of the novel seems natural.  At the novel's end, the reader is left with many unanswered questions which in this case leads to a desire to reread, picking up interrelationships not noticed in the first reading.<br />This is not a &quot;perfect&quot; book but it is well worth your time.	2004-07-03

Expect the conciseness typical of Japanese poetry.  Assume abundant nature imagery.  Add a dash of humor and of romatic love.

The middle poem on the botanist Georg Steller is the most transparent. It provides  not only a biography of Steller's explorations with Bering, but insight into the nature-man relationship.  The first poem on the 16th century painter Matthias Grunewald is less transparent - less biographical information is available.  Sebald again explores the nature-man relationship.  The reader, however, must glean their understanding of Grunewald's painting through Sebald's description and from this understanding move towards Sebald's interpretation.  The third poem is on Sebald himself, exploring the same nature-man relationship.  At times it becomes a &quot;cat and mouse&quot; game as Sebald exhibits both reserve and openess.<br />If you enjoy Sebald's prose, this is a must-read. If you enjoy less traditional literary presentation, consider this a must-read.  For the rest, read the various reviews to determine your interest level - it would never be a mistake to choose this volume.  But there is so much wonderful literature and so little time to read, that you may wish to invest your time elsewhere.	2004-06-27

The tone of the book reflects this orientation - he assumes very little prior knowledge yet never &quot;talks down&quot; to his audience. Rather, he assumes that as one matures as a Christian, your style of Scripture reading will change. Similarly, one reads for different purposes using different methods within a single day as one combines Mass, the Office, and personal reading and prayer.<br />He begins by exploring what the Word of God is and how it relates to our lives, noting that Scripture is life not theory. He stresses the continuity of the Old and New Testaments noting that God's gradual self-revelation applies not only through history but in our individual lives.<br />Next he looks at the traditional four senses of Scripture using the familar medieval verse:<br />&quot;The meaning of the letter gives information about events;<br />Allegory teaches that one should believe;<br />The moral meaning about what we should so;<br />The anagogic about what we should strive for.&quot;<br />This is followed by a discussion of &quot;playful interpretation&quot; in which the sense of Scripture is a a personal, free-association application. As examples he uses St. Augustine and St. Bernhard of Clairvaux.<br />The next chapter discusses the interpretation of Scripture by mystics. This is the weakest chapter of the book. It discusses the use of Scripture in the writings of saints such as St. John of the Cross and the use of Scripture in understanding the experience of union with God. He then moves into a discussion of praying the psalms - in Mass, in the Divine Office ... When we prayer the Psalms we literally pray as our Savior prayed. His thrust is that the openness of the poetry of the psalms allows a certain freshness.<br />In the final chapter he addresses the necessity of regular reading of Scripture for all Christians. In his discussion of lectio divina, his comments on rumination and the tale of abuna Matta al-Miskin are in themselves worth the price of the volume. He stresses the need for a mixture of methods - lectio continua, Scripture study lessons, journals of mediations on the Scripture ....<br />The book as a whole provides a broad, interesting introduction to reading Scripture as the Word of God - as God's Word to us in our time and place.on rumination and the tale of abuna Matta al-Miskin are in themselves worth the price of the volume.

While the selections in &quot;The Adam of Two Edens&quot; are poems of political exile, Darwish is not a poet of Palestinian radicalism so much as a poet of the human race.  In his poetry, he moves easily between cultures that have inhabited Palestine - Mesopotamian, Kurdish, Greek, Roman, Jewish, Islamic, Christian.  This comprehesive view gives his poetry a wisdom and universalism rarely found in contemporary poetry.  His poetry is concrete with subtle surprising use of language: &quot;We have only one dream: / that friendly breezes blow / aromas of Arabian coffee / to our hills surrounded by / summer and strangers.&quot; OR &quot;The night is the exact size of my horses.&quot;<br />In an odd way Darwish's understanding of exile is closely related to that of Jabes.  Therefore, it seems reasonable to me that Darwish be taught in Israeli schools (see editorial reviews above).  &quot;This is my absence, a master who imposes his laws / on the descendants of Lot / and sees no scapegoat for Sodom but myself.&quot;	2004-01-12

This hesitancy is reflected in two ways: first, his insistence that the subjective experience of lectio divina be subjected to the discernment of the group and second, that a more Protestant &quot;objective&quot; study of the text precede the lectio divina.  It is worth noting that for mediatio he suggests the imaginative approach most frequently associated with the Ignatian exercises. The result is a small group &quot;lectio divina&quot; which may work well as an introduction to lectio divina for Evangelical small study groups, but is questionable as a general introduction.<br />My concerns begin with the directedness of the &quot;objective&quot; study - directed at times by multiple choice questions and at other times by mingling of personal application with the &quot;objective&quot; study.  My concerns continue with assumptions as to what the person praying the Scripture will hear.  After listening to the Scripture and noting what word/phrase catches one's attention the questions are: &quot;How is my life touched by this word?&quot; &quot;Am I being invited to respond?&quot; ending with prayer for the individual to your right in response to the invitation they noted.<br />The result is that the focus becomes too oriented toward the human rather than the divine.  And, it appears to me as a Catholic, that the author fails to trust in God's Scripture as a living communication between the lover (God) and the beloved (human) in the here and now.<br />Nonetheless, the volume is useful as a way to introduce people used only to the intellectual study of Scripture to Scripture as direct prayer/communication.  From the suggestions for further reading, I believe that the author &quot;did his homework&quot; and deliberately chose the audience and focus for the program.  That is not an audience with which I am familar.  But for individuals already comfortable with imaginative approaches to Scripture and contemplation, this is not an appropriate introductory volume.nd deliberately chose the audience and focus for the program.

It has enjoyed a recent revival among laity as they seek Scripture study and prayer for laity (as opposed to within religious orders).  Thelma Hall provides an introduction that fits within the revival with several references to Thomas Merton and Thomas Keating, themselves each important in the contemplative tradition.<br />The strengths of this book include Hall's excellent selection of quotations to promote her views, her emphasis on a loving relationship as the model which prohibits a method, and her selection of potential texts for the initial practice of lectio divina.<br />The primary weaknesses as an introductory text is that it presumes the contemplative step is a &quot;mystical&quot; experience.  This leads to discussions of the false-self / true-self dichotomy and of &quot;dark night of the soul.&quot;  This places the volume with the same audience as Merton, Keating, Pennington etc..  This is an audience with less need for an introductory volume than the &quot;typical Catholic.&quot;<br />St. John of the Cross's paraphrase of Lk 11:9 is an accurate description of lectio divina &quot;Seek in READING / and you will find in MEDITATION; / knock in PRAYER / and it will be opened to you / in CONTEMPLATION.&quot;  However, the description of Dom Marmion reflects more accurately Hall's approach: &quot;We read (Lectio)/ under the eye of God (Meditatio)/ until the heart is touched (Oratio)/ and leaps to flame (Contemplatio).<br />In this context, Hall provides 500 Scripture texts that are suitable for the initial practice of lectio divina. The readings are divided into 50 topics such as &quot;Accepting Love,&quot; &quot;Anxiety,&quot; &quot;Discernment of Spirits,&quot; &quot;Following the Lord,&quot; etc. She provides a citation for the full passage and a key phrase &quot;summary&quot; to allow the selection of a particular passage.  This allows the novice to select quickly topics and passages that will be fruitful.<br />In short, this is one of several introductory volumes for lectio divina.  If you flourish reading Merton and practicing Centering Prayer, this is an excellent choice.elect quickly topics and passages that will be fruitful.<br />In short, this is one of several introductory volumes for lectio divina.

Stravinskas devotes one chapter to the Biblical texts of the Mass.  This volume is complementary, providing the Biblical theologicial foundations of the Mass.  The books is divided into four chapters - introductory rites, Liturgy of the Word, Eucharistic Prayer,and Communion/concluding rites.  Each chapter contains a clear and concise discussion of the relevant Scriptural basis for the liturgy (acts, words and environment), 7 Scriptural meditations on the liturgy and finally questions for group discussion.<br />While the book serves it purpose well, again unnecessary polemics weaken the text.  Inveighing against the English translation rather than simply stating the original Latin quickly becomes tiresome.  Confusion of grammatical gender and biological gender in the discussion of inclusive language, weakens Fr. Stravinskas' argument by calling into question his clarity of thought. The meditations built around polemics are not well suited for a group - they encourage argument rather than sharing.<br />In some areas, the issues raised tangentially date the volume.  In a few places, the new General Instructions of the Roman Missal and modifications from the National Conference of Catholic Bishops have superceded the author's comments.  Finally, the appendix on the use of Latin would fit more closely into the contemporary climate if it acknowledged the Eastern rites of the Catholic Church.<br />Still, I have no suggestions for books more clearly written as introductory books for the general population (high school and above) than the pair of books by Fr. Stravinskas.  I say pair because the combination of text (The Catholic Church and the Bible) and theology (The Bible and the Mass) is better than either standing on its own.	2004-01-01

While he writes from the perspective of an exiled Palestinian, he does so in a manner that speaks of universal exile (or alienation).  He writes with images and language that speaks well across cultures; the few pages of glossary provide what little may not be immediately known to a western reader.  His images are arresting but simple: &quot;A silver thread is drawn out of mulberry trees / forming letters on the page of night&quot; or &quot;We gnawed on stones to open a space for jasmine&quot;.  He makes effective use of repetition, with and without variation.  He uses the common base of Judaism, Christianity and Islam as a cultural base for recognizing common humanity: &quot;Beneath us is Noah's flood, Babylon, broken corpses, / skeletons, temples, and the breath of peoples' cries / for help upon the face of the waters.&quot;<br />Poem after poem requires a second, a third reading not because of failure to understand in the first reading but because of the beauty and depth of thought held in the poem.<br />Yes, it would be nice to be able to read the original, but lacking that capability, the translation provides immediate enjoyment.	2003-12-31

Stravinskas is known for his readability, clarity, and orthodoxy, all of which are present in this volume.  The initial material deals primarily with the understanding of the relationships between Scripture, Tradition and the Church. The middle, and primary, material deals with the Mass - it's Scriptural and Judaic use of time, candles, incense, etc. as well as the Biblical basis of the Mass.  The segment on the Mass texts which cross-references them to the Catechism of the Catholic Church and Scripture is in itself worth the cost of the book.  The final segment deals more specifically with apologetics - a Catholic response to Fundamentalist and sola scriptura beliefs.<br />Unfortunately, Fr. Stranvinskas has occasionally been sloppy in his thought.  In his section against inclusive language, he confuses linguistic gender with biological gender.  In his discussion of Tradition, he refers to &quot;Oriental memory&quot; where his point appears rather to reflect the difference between oral and written cultures.  In his discussion of the King James translation, he fails to recognize that the 1611 King James translation was of the Septuagint i.e. the Catholic canon.<br />While I would recommend this book, with reservations, for high school level religious education, I will continue to seek a similar book with greater concern for precision.	2003-12-29

But the candelabra / ... were missing&quot;<br />Whether speaking of Jesus in the present, reflecting on apocryphal stories of Jesus or reconsidering the historical Jesus, the selected poems are creative.

The differences in place and time and religion of the originals have been flattened into an English-speaking present.  The stark clarity of image in the originals have been muddled into blurred images of modern interpretation.<br />While it is true that the ecstatic experience of love is common across culturals, the language in which the experience is described is always the unique voice of a particular individual's experience of the divine.

First, one is impressed by the precision of observation and expression.  While the symptoms are shared with other patients, this is always the description of a particular victim of the disease. Second, one is impressed by the ever-changing attitude of Daudet to the progression and feared progression of the diease.  Third, one is impressed by Daudet himself in his concern for those around him.  The result is an enjoyable, informative introduction to Daudet as a person and as an example of human response to continuous pain.<br />Julian Barnes' translation is excellent - footnotes are provided that identify people, places, medicines that are unfamilar.  Two short essays on Daudet and syphlis complete the book.<br />While this book may not appear to be high on the to-be-read-list, it deserves a place near the top.	2003-05-17

The title story &quot;Last Vanities&quot; explores the aged through a couple nearing their golden annivesary.  &quot;A Wife&quot; explores disapointment in a traditional farm family and the responsibility of an author in closing the story.  &quot;The Free House&quot; is explores social services, &quot;The Promise&quot; explores a long-term non-traditional relationship ... in each context Jaeggy writes succinctly, controlling the readers response through carefully chosen words.

Hildegart was a political, feminist child-genius in Spain. Her major activity occurred between 1928-1933.  She was a planned superwoman of her mother who raised her specifically to fulfill a political mission.  The author has done an excellent job of portraying the socialist movement of the period and the roots of Aurora's project.  There is the usual gap between words and deeds, the political deals, the self-serving compromises etc.  But most of all there is a mother on a mission, ignoring and overriding anything for Hildegart that is outside Aurora's goal.<br />Beautifully written, this book is very appropriate to our times.  It shows in a sympathic way the dangers of fanaticism.	2002-10-09

For each day of the week there is a selection of readings.  These readings may be a single sentence, a poem, a paragraph, a teaching tale.  They are a variety of traditional Judaica, philosophers, poets, Christians, Hindus, Buddhist, Taoist.  They are so well selected that they create a coherent whole not a mishmash and reflect a deep, mature spirituality on the part of the collector.  While the weekly cycle may target a Jewish audience, the book is so well put together that it can be recommended for individuals of any religious persuasion.<br />A concrete example of the variety.  For week 28 (Leviticus 14:1-15:33) Sunday: Emily Dickinson, Jacob J. Halevi, Dag Hammarskjold; Monday: psalm, Talmud; Tuesday: psalm, Chasidic, Kenneth Hildebrand, Leigh Hunt; Wednesday: Talmud, Blaise Pascal, Sigrid Undset, Sir Thomas Browne; Thursday: Psalm, Yiddish proverb, Janet Harrison, Archibald Rutledge, Juvenal; Friday: Abba Kovner, Chasidic, Elinor Wylie, Helen Keller; Shabbat: Psalm, Lion Feuchtwanger, Clarence E, Pickett, Booker T.

Skarmeta has grown into an excellent author; unfortunately this stories precede his maturity as a writer.  They are solid short stories but of the same quality as many solid writers.  Put another way, chose any book from a well-edited imprint and you'll get stories of similar value.<br />Many of these stories read as if they were autobiographical - a Chilean college student or world vagabond about the author's age etc.  This allows the author to skip creating individual, realistic characters.  The one exception to this is the title story.<br />The writing has excellent detail, often with a poet's eye.  Unlike his later work, however, there is frequently too much detail; it smothers the characters and their actions.<br />My favorites in this collection are: &quot;The Composition&quot; the story of a young boy's political awakening; &quot;Watch Where the Wolf Is Going&quot; a conquistador's story of theft and &quot;Fish&quot; a sad, comic story of an elderly couple's attempt to retain their dignity while living in their son's house.<br />If you are already a Skarmeta fan, this book gives perspective on his grown as an artist.  If you've not yet read any Skarmeta, start with a more recent volume.	2002-10-06

An excellent example of his understanding of story is \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\". Its epitath is from Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows\\"; the poem explores the harsher reality of animals' lives while acknowledging their acceptance of their place in the universe. He uses the recurrent image of music - \\"absent music\\" or \\"music, seeming to have gone, glides through the reed on its sinuous way\\" - as the life-force of which the river animals feel a part.<br />In \\"A Poem for Storytellers\\" he acknowledges that stories are all we have to change the world, but the story has been lost in transmission. In this poem, as well as several with distinctly Kabbalistic references, the power of the word, its margins, its hiddenness is explored. Occasionally, his vocabulary reaches beyond the \\"average reader\\" as in \\"A Poem for the Gret Heresy\\": \\"From provincial gaardens given to weeds, / matter pullulates, forgetful of the season, / enticed to emulate / divine emanations: / the extoplasmic furniture of junk.\\"<br />More frequently his language is that of a storyteller as in \\"Four Impromptus\\": \\"These are the goblins / who shadowed the old man, / leading him astray / as he walked in the forest.\\"<br />Story, faith, music, humility ... these are the themes of this well written poetry. While not among the \\"greats\\" of English poetry, this poet is worthy of the readers' time.	2002-10-01

Too often, however, it fails to move me as poetry.<br />Most notably, the images are rarely fresh.  Unlike the poetry of Gavin, the images never led to a &quot;I'd never thought of it that way.&quot;  The only image that caused second thoughts was of a horse-mounted policeman hugging his horse &quot;until helmet and reins are one.&quot; Here I paused because the image didn't make sense - the rounded compactness of helmet with the thin length or reins ... a helmet with a tail?  Typical images: sunset's stained-glass colors&quot; or monarch butterflies' wings &quot;orange-and-black stained glass&quot; or &quot;his voice is a rainstorm that rinses air to reveal earth's surprises.&quot;<br />The language leans towards prose in the sense of complete sentences, a quality Shulman often uses to advantage in the more personal poems where it lends a sense of honesty (as opposed to artifact).  The language is firmly grounded in detail &quot;wind peel a sand rose,&quot; &quot;no hawk swoops down from a TV antenna.&quot;  Occasionally obscure words are used i.e. &quot;fusilladed&quot; but more frequently it is references &quot;Li Po&quot; or &quot;Tai Chin&quot; that require significant cultural knowledge.  She compensates for this with end notes.<br />There are several poems worth rereading:&quot;God speaks&quot; in which prior versions of the world and many gods are described with delightful humor and serious purpose; &quot;The Dancers&quot; a tribute to her parents dancing in the Depression unaware of what the future held; and several sonnets of the &quot;One Year Without Mother&quot; sequence - &quot;What Can You Believe&quot; which exposes the vacillation in belief/disbelief in God; &quot;Ring Sale&quot; which exposes lingering uneasiness over a family heirloom; &quot;Requiem&quot;, Mozart's to be exact.<br />Not a bad volume, simply, for me, quite forgettable.	2002-09-30

This novel is based on an actual event which occurs during the annual pilgrimage during the Triduum (last three days of Holy Week).  The tale follows the life of a young girl through her life as the head of a religious society, as a &quot;voodoo priestess&quot; (my term not Montero's).  Montero assumes that the reader has little knowledge of the life and beliefs of Dominican/Haitian suger cane workers.  Therefore, she provides rich detail setting the scene for the reader, remarkably so given the length of the book.  While the book centers on the love triangle of Zule, her teacher's son and a rival priest, there are many memorable figures presented in the book.  Montero's ability to make characters memorable is a major asset.  While the (tragic)outcome is apparent early in the story, the means of the outcome is not.  This allows Montero to establish a foreboding atmosphere without disclosing the story's climax.  The foreboding verges on heavyhanded oppression; readers may quarrel whether Montero crossed the line.  Even if one considers the foreboding heavyhanded, this book is enjoyable reading and educational regarding life in Haiti/Dominican Republic.	2002-09-24

The characters are memorable -  Bobbe Bela from Russia, the actor father, the talented and unstable brother, and the author himself seeking home and identity.  A significant component of his seeking identity is found in language - Spanish, Yiddish, Hebrew, English.  He compares multiple languages with masks of an actor, one of many elements in his tale that cause the reader to reflect.  Another component is the author's finding his calling as an author - the influences (and absence of encouragement) that shape his writing, the language and the content.  Another component is his searching for his Jewishness - in Israel, in Spain, in theology books (and classes), in Yiddish literature.<br />This memoir is excellent reading on being human - the reader gains insight into human experience as a whole through the detailed exposition of what it means to be a specific human, Ilan Stavans.	2002-09-23

Doves will love it; hawks will not - it is not a piece that will change anyone's mind on the ethics of war.  It does, however, provide a moving illustration of how our prayers for our welfare are also prayers for the destruction of others.  It recognizes that it is human nature to refuse to recognize the destructive side.  It reminds one of the gap between recognized ideals and our actual conduct.<br />The drawings by John Groth add to the text but do not overcome the impression of a printing that was thrown together carelessly and quickly to meet political goals in our current crisis.  Quality of production aside, it is worth while to see this side of Mark Twain's writing regardless of your views on war.	2002-09-19

Two aspects of the story make this a memorable bit of literature:  First, the discription of the physical setting and the small details making the village unique, isolated and realistic are superb.  Second, the understanding of human group behavior is outstanding - both in the definition of &quot;outsiders&quot; and in the common story required to become an &quot;insider&quot;.  This aspect is established early and confirmed by the climax of the story.<br />Excellent writing, excellent control of characters, interesting and simple plot ... well worth your time.	2002-09-16

The book's strength is in showing the successful rural black family's attitude towards whites and in showing the role of the church in their community.  The plot line holding it together is that of a talented teenager unable to come to terms with his homosexual orientation, sure that it will damn him in the sight of God.  The context for this self-damnation is set by his deacon grandfather who raised him and who counsels members of the community, his great aunts who assist in raising him who are mothers in the church, and his preacher cousin - the religion which runs through the family is a stern religion with the backbone that allowed his family to succeed.<br />Within this framework, we get wonderful prose describing the disappearing culture - house raisings, pig slaughters... - and the \\"new culture\\" of racial intergration.  We see several generations attempting to adjust to the new world while retaining their family values.  All in all a book well worth the time required to read and savor it.	2002-09-09

That is true in this volume as well, however, there are also uncommon devices in the presentation of the plot. One begins with the finding (and not reporting) of a body of a student floating in the pool. This is followed by the callous killing of an accomplist in petty crime, a switch to an underage stripper, and finally the introduction of a famous psychologist known for his work with children at risk, who, after the loss of his family, is trying to lose himself in saving a private, residential school. Over the following 400 pages these story threads are slowly pulled together into a single picture - but pulled together as two separate strands, the primary one following the school, the secondary one following a Boston cop tracking down a serial murderer.<br />That this novel keeps the readers attention, keeps the characters distinct (admittedly the teachers begin to run together), and the motivations are realistic (well, the step father is pushing credulity) is a credit to Dobyns' skill. Unfortunately, the loose ends, the \\"wrapup\\" being the perspective of the secondary strand, and the unbelieveable match between characters' psychological needs and the plot putting them in a position to test this need combine to make this less successful than several of Dobyns' other works. But it is still great fun for light reading.	2002-09-09

It is a difficult book to review because much of the pleasure of the book is the subtle shifting of the readers perception of what is \\"factual\\", what is \\"subjective\\" and what is \\"true\\" within the context of the world of the novel.<br />In the Company of Angels is above all an understated story that explores a number of themes related to war, especially WW II including: the holocaust, the tension between duty and love, the use of convent as both an escape and a call, the relationship between devotion and insanity, denial as a response to the atrocities of war, the moral judgment of killing individuals in a war ...  However, the book presents these horrors to us in a surprisingly gentle way; it sneaks up on us, catches us off-guard by changing the ground under us, reverses our preconceptions as to what is real.<br />The material for this wonder - a Jewish child whose family owned greenhouses, a novice nun whose father was a chocolater and whose mother was obsessed by religion, a young artist (and captain)who courted the future novice while providing data to the German army, the Mother Superior who has seen her convent and nuns evaporate under the hardships of war and moral choices in war.<br />This gentle, stark novel is an excellent meditation on war well worth its place on your must-read stack.	2002-09-09

The support for the targum comes from traditional means of manipulating the original text, the offering of multiple alternative readings, and traditional support from targums, midrash, Philo, pseudepigrapha, kabbala ...<br />The two students were so broadly sterotyped that I came to not trust what they quoted or argued ... especially since the arguments were often personal and sexist rather than to the point of the targum.  Therefore, I found what I'd expected to be the strength of the book - showing of the study partner relationship - to be rather its weakness.<br />The actual strength of the book is in the innovative interpretation of the original text - the garden as temple, the injunction to not eat of the fruit to apply only to Adam not to Eve ...  For this, the book is sufficient to drive one to original source material - a sign of excellence in books such as this.	2002-08-30

The book itself is divided into two parts: 1 provides a history of salvation as presented through the six covenants (Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Christ) 2 provides an introduction to the traditional four senses of Scripture (literal, allelgorical, moral and anagogical). The material is presented in a deliberately casual manner.  At times the language is delightful and effective (\\"Bullwinkle syndrome\\"), at other times it approximately the padding of oral speech, occasionally it verges on an insult to the readers' intelligence.  Put another way, Shea knows the audience that he intends to reach and writes specifically for them.<br />For this same reason, the book contains comparatively little detail on its subject.  Rather, it presents a commonsense argument for the validity of the approach, building the case in small increments few could deny and providing multiple instances to support each incremental argument.  This approach works well for individuals with little knowledge of the Bible or with a bias against the traditional form of interpretation.<br />In short, Shea does an excellent job of reaching a very specific audience.  If you fall within that audience, I recommend the book.  If you do not, there are more informative texts available.	2002-08-25

This is tradition applied more clearly than I have seen before - and I read a great deal of material in the area.  She applies this three-fold typology of creation, original sin, the flood, Abraham, Moses ... building a very solid foundation of Biblical and liturgical knowledge in an easy to understanding way.  Along with way a variety of other Bible interpretation topics are explored - literary genre, document theory, form criticism - explored in sufficient detail to make the necessary points in language clear enough to be accessible to a very broad audience.  This is truly a book to rave about.	2002-08-23

In fact, this book proves the more mixed the better to properly enjoy the recipe for Grasshopper Enchiladas.  If the grasshopper based recipes don't appeal you may replace the game hopscotch with grapescotch or \\"duck, duck, goose\\" with \\"grape, grape, grasshopper\\".  For the musician there are the famous folk songs \\"Battle Hymn of St. Urho\\" or \\"What Shall We Do with the Hoppers, Urho?\\".  Want art? try Urho's Grasshopper quilt block.  Of course various (and incompatible) versions of the miracles of St. Urho are given.  And for the serious-minded a history of the St. Urho celebrations with photographic documentation.<br />As with any genuine folklore - including a spoof on St. Patrick and excuse to celebrate Finn-hood - the material is of uneven quality.  Joanne Asala, however, has succeeded in providing a broad spectrum of material, presented it well, and achieved the right balance of seriousness and levity.<br />While I'll grant this book isn't everyone \\"cup of tea\\" (or more accurately \\"glass of St. Urho's Shake\\"), it should appeal to a wide audience - teachers, folklorists, Finns, those who've had a bit too much of St. Patrick, and those who need to extend the spring St. Patrick day celebration (March 17th) with a celebration of St. Urho (March 16th).	2002-08-19

It is enhanced by brush and ink illustrations by Stephen Addiss and a brief biographic introduction to the poem Yosano Akiko.<br />The most jarring poems are the twelve in modern style - jarring in the sense of being furthest from the reader's expectations. \\"Women Are Plunder\\" is a feminist poem opening with the image of a department store sale as a universal call to women. \\"The Town of Amazement\\" describes a Utopia - one without student plays - in which the power structure (political, educational, legal, religious. famial) is leveled.  \\"Cold Supper\\" explores family financial troubles, a plight frequent in the poet's life. \\"You Shall Not Be Killed, Brother!\\" is a pacifist poem.  Most of these modern poems are relatively time bound - interesting but ephemeral with some exceptions.<br />The poems written in the traditional tanka form, however, are more universal exploring sensuality, sexuality, religion ... An example: \\"On her cheek and mine, / although our minds so differ, / like utter strangers, / the pine winds blow equally - / almost as though we were friends.\\"  In these poems one sees a genius transforming traditional image and form into something new, expressing experience previously hidden and confronting the changing views of society.	2002-08-18

The last, Recovered Body, is the only one of these that I have read. If the selection from it is representative, a significant portion of memorable poems has been excluded for this collection.  The strongest poems in Recovered Body, \\"The Recovered Midrashim of Rabbi Sab\\" in included in part - this group of poems are insightful and unusual takes on scriptural stories.<br />From The Translation of Babel comes an excellent string of poems \\"The Translation of Raimundo Luz\\" which in a series of related poems (\\"My Infancy\\", \\"My Personal History\\", \\"My Language\\", \\"My Moral Dream\\", \\"My Imitation\\", \\"Our Lost Angels\\" ...) manages to explicate liberation theology in the best poetic, \\"post-modern\\" sense through the confounding of the life/personality of Raimundo Luz and Christ.  From the same book comes a delightful homage to Calvino \\"Lost Cities: Calvino\\" and a wonderfully sassy \\"Lucifer's Epistle to the Fallen\\" with delightful lines: \\"Him! Showboat with the Heavy Thumbs! Pretender / at Creation! Maker of Possibilities!\\" combined with insightful images: \\"Imagine! The ignorance you're dressed in! / The way you wear it! ...\\"<br />In the new poems severals of the \\"Adventures in New Testament Greek\\" stand out as serious, playful analysis of key Biblical terms: Metanoia, Haireis, Nous, Mysterion ...<br />While the collection will appeal especially to those with an interest in religious poetry, this collection is solid poetry - worth consideration simply as excellent poetry.	2002-08-10

With such family incidents good and bad, the author captures well the impending sense of doom of the child for whom it is formless.  As readers, we learn early that the family died, early in the novel - the suspense is in the how, why, and by what trigger.  The novel brings us slowly but surely to the answer ... the only answer that fits the family dynamics.<br />Why only 4 stars?  The novel was one I could set down, could even go to bed without finishing - a poor sign for a thriller.	2002-08-07

It contains a brief introduction which illustrates that liturgy is a sustaining act for monks then sets forth the agenda for the remainder of the book:<br />1. The primacy of adoration<br />2. The splendor of the liturgy<br />3. The sense of the Church<br />4. The formation of the interior man.<br />While the essays are brief, they do pay attention to detail.  For example, regarding the primacy of adoration a case is made for the necessity of theocentric prayer and for the priest facing east.  Here, as elsewhere, the Ratzinger report is quoted.<br />Regarding the splendor of the liturgy, the case is made for beauty as a need of the poor (a way of countering the relative value of finances for social justice) and as an evangelizing element.  The latter is supported by the common quote from Chronicles of Nestor on Orthodox liturgy as heaven itself.<br />In the discussion of the sense of Church, Bossuet's definition of liturgy as &quot;Tradition professed&quot; and theology as &quot;Tradition defined&quot; provides a springboard for discussing the necessity of tradition in worship.  This section also provides a telling analysis of community as thee worshipping body.  It is here that the author most clearly states his bias: &quot;... in the terrible years of the 1970s, a destructive clergy discarded genuflections, sacred rites, Gregorian Chant and reverence for the angels and saints, ...&quot;<br />The final chapter regarding formation expands the discussion to include the Liturgy of the Hours and meditation on liturgical texts.<br />This volume is a solid introduction.  However, in its dislike of the liturgical reforms it fails to make essential distinctions.  Some of the chaos of the 1970's was the result of individuals' who both misunderstood the reforms and/or failed to understand the basic principles of good liturgy.  Some of the reforms were required precisely because the liturgy more closely met the needs of monastics (like the author) than of laity.<br />In the hands of a reader with a solid understanding of liturgy, I recommend this volume.  In the hands of one unwilling to acknowledge Vatican II, this could serve as an additional spark to a smoldering fire.iturgy more closely met the needs of monastics (like the author) than of laity.<br />In the hands of a reader with a solid understanding of liturgy, I recommend this volume.

Imagine the Tao Te Ching translated into Islamic terms, the Rg Veda reworked as a Judaic text, the Diamond Sutra translated as a Christian text; you are imagining something similar to these reworkings of the Psalms by Stephen Mitchell.  While Norman Fischer in his Opening to You: Zen-Inspired Translations of the Psalms tried to translate the psalms into the universal religious concepts shared with Zen Buddhism, Mitchell recreates the psalms with Zen-specific terminology and contemporary scientific terminology which may clash with the images of the original psalms.<br />Example: from Psalm 148 &quot;Praise him, you bodhisattvas, / you angels burning with his love. / Praise him in the depths of matter; / praise him in atomic space. / Praise him, you whirling electrons, / you unimaginable quarks.&quot;<br />The result is a set of poems which are sometimes &quot;selected &amp; adapted&quot; as the book title implies, but which are often &quot;inspired by&quot;.  In those poems which speak from a consistent viewpoint, in which the mix of Judaism, Zen and science does not clash, there are excellent poems - the quality and sensativity one associates with Mitchell.  Otherwise, this is one of his weaker efforts.  It may be read as poetry but does not serve as a way into the psalms.	2002-08-05

Claudel has utilized unusual placement of words and splitting of words in ways that emphasis particular letters/sounds.  There are two poems to a page, French and English pages facing each other.  The poems are not haiku nor are they Zen Buddhist.  However, they are generally grounded in concrete observation with a contemplative bent.  The result is much more exquisite than most Western haiku.<br />Some focus on mental activity, for example: &quot;The peony / and this flush/ in us/ that precedes / thought&quot; Note that a significant portion of the poem is lost when separated from the ideogram and spacing of the original.<br />Some focus on nature with human reminents: &quot;In the forest / on an abandoned / grave / a white / lantern&quot;.<br />This is an excellent cross-cultural literary work well worth the readers' time.	2002-08-03

This volume contains selections from her available books: \\"She Had Some Horses\\", \\"Secrets from the Center of the World\\", \\"In Mad Love and War\\", \\"The Woman Who Fell from the Sky\\" and \\"A Map to the Next World\\".  As is frequently the case, the selections for this book are not precisely the poems I would have chosen.  It does include the most powerful poems, for example \\"She Had Some Horses\\" with it's pounding litany rhythms, \\"Letter from the End of the Twentieth Century\\" which is the title track of her cd, \\"The Creation Story\\" with its exquisite line \\"I never had the words / to carry a friend from her death / to the stars / correctly.\\"  Somewhat to my surprise, the poems from Secrets from the Center of the World which fit the photographs so precisely in their original context, also succeed as poetry only in this volume (although I'd still recommend the original).<br />New to me in this volume are the poems from her early chapbooks \\"The Last Song\\" and \\"What Moon Drove Me to This?\\" as well as new poems from 1999-2001.  The chapbook poems are interesting as the beginning of Harjo's development as a poet as well as being interesting poems in their own right ..\\"Four Horse Songs\\" and \\"I Am a Dangerous Woman\\" stand out.  In the new material, \\"Morning Prayers\\" has memorable lines \\"the nothingness / is vast and stunning, / brims with details ...\\" as does \\"Faith\\" with \\"I might miss / The feet of god / Disguised as trees.\\"<br />Harjo's poetry is strongly political - a Native peoples voice angry at the European invaders/immigrants.  More importantly, her voice is one seeking a way to live well in contemporary society where living well requires memory of a time we lived with greater respect for our environment, greater responsibility for our network of relatives.	2002-08-02

The first section \\"Deep Below Our Violences\\" consists of poems that are well written with an interesting mix of topics and forms.  However, they say little about the world and humanity that is not common poetic parlance.  \\"Alexandrian Fragments\\" uses the burning of the library in Alexandria as its primary image; \\"Archaeology: A Subsequent Lecture\\" uses a dig; \\"Interval with Erato\\" a sensual/sexual encounter with the muse ...<br />The second section \\"The Recovered Midrashim of Rabbi Sab\\", in contrast, shows a very inventive poet writing distinctive, meaningful prose poems.  \\"YHWH's Image\\" presents an image of Time which pauses, twitches its tail, opens it's eyes while God creates creates humanity in his own image, a precise image molded in clay on God's body.  \\"The Turning of Lot's Wife\\" shows the wife as the compassionate one: \\"... she could not turn her back on even one doomed child of the city, but must turn her back instead upon the saved.\\"  \\"In the Well of Joseph's Brief Despair\\" presents the view of the world from the bottom of the well - and its continuing effect on Joseph after his life was spared.<br />The final section \\"Supplications\\" presents two strong themes - Hebrew vs. Greek thought patterns and the value of body.  The topics supporting these themes include religious stylites (monks living on small, high platforms, the harrowing of hell, the death of the crucified man headed for paradise, Mary Magdalen ... in these poems the same formal strengths appear that appear in the first section.  However, here Cairns more frequently has something uncommon to say.	2002-08-02

A few poems require academic knowledge of poets and religious beliefs of other eras, but on the whole these poems are acceptable to the general reading public.<br />His poetry is written in comparatively long lines with a conversational rhythm.  Unlike some writing in such a style, however, his work is not prose broken into lines but rather carefully crafted poetry.<br />The strength of the poetry is often in the cohesiveness built from disparate parts.  Dennis is able to connect ancient mythology, Japanese poets, Biblical references, Moby Dick etc. to our contemporary lives.<br />Examples, \\"Sun Rise\\" begins with the Aztec human sacrifices only to move to the Jewish diasporia's revolution from temple sacrifice to a religion of the books.  Or \\"Eternal Poetry\\" which explores prison reform while insisting it is not a topic appropriate to poetry.  \\"The Serpent to Adam\\" is a surprising evaluation of what was (or was not) lost in the fall of Adam.  \\"Prophet\\" uses the story of Jonah to explore the work of a prophet in our own time, in soup kitchen.	2002-07-29

More specifically, he has taken a number of liturgically important psalms, often only the liturgical selection of verses, and created psalm prayers in contemporary language and style.  What is most impressive about this work is he has usually retained Biblical images, making these psalm prayers a school for the eventual praying of the psalms themselves.<br />This is not to say that Haas' renderings are great poetry, but they are singable/chantable in the structure of the Liturgy of the Hours (i.e. they have antiphons, can be sung in unison or antiphonally ...).<br />An example from Psalm 55: &quot;If I had the winds of a dove, / I would fly away to safety. / I would fly far, / far away, / I would hide in the wilderness.&quot;<br />I recommend it as one of the best collections I have seen attempting to fulfil the &quot;praying the psalms but not understanding the psalms as prayer&quot; need.	2002-07-28

It is assumed that the celebrant is either a priest or deacon.  It recognizes that ritual includes symbolic actions and items as well as the words.  It is firmly planted in the theology of the family as the domestic dwelling of the Church.<br />In format, it begins with a liturgy of the Word (greeting, opening prayer, reading from the epistles, responsorial psalm, Gospel, homily, litany of intercession, prayer).  A hymn is then used in a manner similar to that of Stabat Mater in the stations of the cross.  Each station consists of a ritual action, a prayer and a verse of the hymn.  Blessings are provided for the front door, the crucifix, the Book of the Scriptures, the living-room, the dining-room, the kitchen, the younger children's room, the older children's room, the parent's room, a workroom (workshop, sewing room,laundry room etc.), the study, a garden/patio/terrace, a playroom/sports room/swimming pool, a consecration of the family to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.  The rite ends with a final blessing.<br />The prayers themselves are modern, appropriate and often beautiful.  The blessing for the kitchen is reasonably typical: &quot;O God, / you have created us of spirit and flesh, of soul and body. / Bless this kitchen / in which food for the sustenance of the family is prepared. / Renewed in strength may they continue to do your will each day: / and may they never be forgetful of those who hunger and thirst.&quot;<br />Excellent ritual which is very adaptable to specific situations.	2002-07-28

The \\"Unholy Sonnets\\" are excellent, quiet and low-keyed explorations of God and the human relationship to God.  The poet rightly trusts his voice and skill.  There are wonderful images that Jarman makes work well: \\" A useful God will roost in a bird-box, / Wedge-head thrust out, red-feathered in the sun.\\"  As a member of the new formalism school of poetry, Jarman succeeds in using form in a way that seems natural not forced.  In an odd way, his skill with forms reminds me of Robert Frost.<br />Jarman is not limited by form - the title poem is a prose poem exploring the proper roles of parents and a stranger (preacher)sent to comfort them after their teenage daughter committed suicide.  What would happen if the preacher \\"comforted\\" them with the theology of Ecclesiastes?  Like the sonnets, this is an honest exploration of the tensions of faith in the modern world.<br />Unfortunately, while most of the remainder of the book shows the same skill, honesty and faith of these poems, the poems never \\"speak\\" to me - there is a formal distance in the writing that never pulls me into the world of the poetry nor resonates with my own world of humanity, poetry and faith. I was uninvolced even by beautiful poetry such as the fourth section of \\"The Past From the Air\\" which includes inspired lines: \\"And what God sees, if God sees anything, / Looks like the crawling colors on a bubble / ... / He sees a woman asking him to read / Her mind.  He pities her.  He cannot read.\\"	2002-07-28

Yes / I am. Yes I am.\\" which transforms into joyous exuberance which transforms into sexual slang which transforms into nature-poet-laughter. This broad range of subject matter works in the playful, associative style of the poem.<br />\\"The Necklace of Seeds\\" begins \\"From her chamber Su Ch'in\\" - each of the semi-independent 5 line verses retains a flavour of well-translated Chinese poetry with subtle hints that the poem is contemporary American.<br />\\"Canticle For Her Bedroom\\" is a contemporary litany repeating \\"bless\\" in broken syntax. The ability to select the concrete and a perfect control of line breaks is highlighted in this style: \\"now only for Bill yes o bless / her white hands dropping combs bracelets rings / white blouse white\\".<br />\\"Adam's Poems\\" is a conversation between God and Adam with a surprising play on language and expectations.<br />The remainder of the thirty-eight poems in this collection are similarly diverse. Even the poems that did not speak to me required that I recognize the skill with which it was written.	2002-07-26

This volume is the pre-reform text i.e. the 1960 version of rubrics and breviary.  The chant is from the Roman Antiphonal of 1919.  While the introduction is sufficient for the celebration of compline by those familar with the structure of the Liturgy of the Hours, others may struggle to make the appropriate seasonal adjustments.  The text includes rubrics in italics.  The text is given in Latin and in English.  The music is provided in traditional Gregorian chant notation.  This requires an additional level of expertise by the reader.  The seasonal adjustments require an Ordo to identify feasts and seasons.  The printing is satisfactory but I prefer clearer and large print in prayer books commonly used in dimly lighted rooms.  It is for this I deducted a star.  Otherwise, if you want a copy of the pre-Vatican II compline service, this is a reliable and complete source - complete with the short lesson 1 Peter 5:8-9.	2002-07-25

Some of the tales have Asian roots such as the tale of the Samuria warrior who asks a master about heaven and hell.  Some are traditional elaborations on Biblical texts such as the adjective used to describe Moses.  Some are humorous expansions of Biblical texts such as why Adam and Eve were not made until the sixth day.  Several are stories relating to understanding between Jews, Christians and Muslims.  Some are traditional Hasidic tales.  Some may even be actual experiences of the author.<br />All the stories are told clearly and directly - nothing to come between the reader and the story.  Each is accompanied by a pen and ink drawing reflecting the simplicity and the message of the story.<br />There are many religious story books available - Anthony de Mello, Mulla Nasrudin, The Conference of the Birds, Tales of Hasidic Masters, exempla, Jataka ... - this stands as one of the best.	2002-07-24

While love - physical and emotional - the the focus of this book, even short episodes such as seeking succor in an evensong service demonstrate a perceptiveness for human nature rarely seen in an author.  Not to mention that the same scene shows a wicked sense of humor.<br />The narrator, clearly bisexual, has a history of love affairs that last about six months.  Narrative time in this book is not sequential but it effectively begins with the narrator's attempt to \\"settle down.\\"  This effort fails as the narrator falls in love again - but this time with a woman who demands honesty in the relationship.  The slow movement towards honesty - hastened by a middle-aged female boss - forms the core of the plot.  The self-deception and the slow recognition of the truth behind \\"benevolent\\" actions gives the novel a sense of truth rare in contemporary literature.<br />The first few pages have a deliberately roughness in syntax that initially put me off.  Eventually the novel hits its stride and syntax reads with a rhythm appropriate to the content.  An excellent novel for your \\"to-be-read\\" stack.	2002-07-14

The book beginss with Cheops declaring he will not build a pyramid. Convinced by his advisors that the pyramid is a necessary counterbalance to opulance, he then wants the largest pyramid, only to be haunted by the pyramid upon its completion. The building of the pyramid rises and falls in the imagination of the populace in countercycle to the rise and fall of political conspiracy. Conspiracy theories led people to disown and own their tier or block of the pyramid. The pyramid(s) continue to spread their power through grave-robbers and copycats.<br />Sound like a dull book? It easily could be. But Kadare is such an excellent author that the book is very readable - its moral unmistakable but still providing dramatic tension in the twists and turns of history. Unless you are specifically interested in political novels, this may not be the first Kadare book you should try - it's not necessarily \\"representative\\". But it is well worth your time.	2002-07-08

The volume begins with an introductory chapter followed by four chapters, each focusing on a gift: the gift of faith, the gift og prayer and ritual, the gift of community, and the gift of self.  Within these building blocks, beginning with a brief experience from real life, the book simply and quietly instills a solid sense of catechesis built on living the faith within community.  It retains a real sense of the doable - for example, for outreach, preschoolers could draw pictures for the homebound.  If you want solid theology in a down-to-earth, reassuring format, this volume is excellent.	2002-07-08

A script writer is dying of cancer.  His double, a producer and second husband of the writer's ex-wife, offers him a project -- a gift to keep his mind on things other than dying. The book narrates the film script he is writing - a film on Greta Garbo centered on the event that turned her from another good actress to the film goddess.  As he researches and writes the script, the writer comes to terms with his own elusive (illusive) love for a half-sister, to terms with living as a passive canvas versus living with self-understanding.<br />The book is exquisite - well researched and perceptive of people and their idols, the effect of time on changing idols.  If you  read for action, this is probably not to your liking.  If you read to expand your understanding of humanity, this belongs on your \\"must read\\" list.	2002-07-07

This is a beautiful book - the &quot;coffee table&quot; style of prayer book in which the art is as important as the prayers.  This style works best as books to dip into in times of special need.  This book, however, is structured as morning and evening prayer for a week.  Morning and evening prayer share the same structure: a single verse of psalm, silent meditation on a sentence, an opening prayer in a Celtic style, two short Scriptural verses for meditation or lectio divina, a prayer of thanksgiving and intercession, a topical sentence of meditation and a closing prayer.<br />J. Philip Newell has done a splendid job of selecting and organizing his material.  However, the material is too slight to constitute material for a retreat - and would quickly become too repetitive if used as a continuous prayer pattern.  The result is a wonderful book for which I can think of no situation for which I would recommend it.  What a pity.	2002-07-07

O'Malley has developed a prayer book with a four week cycle which speaks to contemporary Catholics to whom the psalms and patristic readings are &quot;dead&quot;.  This is not an adaptation of the Liturgy of the Hours; rather it is a substitute.  Morning and Evening prayer have a simple structure: an opening prayer, a &quot;grace&quot; or single sentence to carry with you outside the formal prayer time, a psalm expanded to include a variety of Biblical poetry, a hymn which is usually poetry from the last three or four centuries, and a closing prayer.  Mid-day prayer is the longest adding a prose reading and a Scriptural reading to the format.<br />Representative authors of hymns and readings include: Gerard Manley Hopkins, John Donne, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Graham Greene, John Masefield, e.e. cummings, John Milton, Thomas Merton, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Dag Hammarskjold, T. S. Eliot, Eleanor Farjeon, William Shakespeare, Elinor Wylie ...<br />If you have not found the Liturgy of the Hours prayerful, consider this volume as an alternative.  It is an excellent volume.	2002-07-07

Unfortunately, this book confirms my prejudice.  The front material provides an easy and useful summary of the material, history of the translation, the 19th century shock at the flood myth etc.  The material is superficial - appropriate for late high school students looking for the &quot;good stuff&quot; without any interest in the depth of the story.  The translation itself is very readable - almost too much so as the missing portions of the text are nearly invisible.  The illustrations are very appropriate to the text as translated.  I would recommend this volume for use as a very early introduction to epic literature or as a light summer read.	2002-07-06

The result is familar but not forced verses that scan easily into familar tunes.  Indexes include suggested hymn tunes and liturgical use (calendar).<br />There is a brief introduction giving the history of the reformation Psalters within the Church of Scotland context.  This is so brief that it has little value and, in fact, detracts from the book by demonstrating the author's lack of knowledge in regards to the plain song tradition of the psalter.  Nonetheless, this is a resource will worth having for anyone with need to use psalms in prayer or song.	2002-07-04

As with other volumes in the series, the basic material is provided in small, appropriate chapters followed with questions for reflection and discussion; and quotations from the ritual itself, the Scripture and the Catechism of the Catholic Church.  The meaning of baptism as the first step in the initation rituals, the doctrine of original sin, the practice of naming the child for a saint, and the selection/role of godparents are well explained in contemporary theology.  The volumes of penance, communion and confirmation are superior to this volume because this volume tries too hard to provide solid theology at odds with traditional misunderstandings - without direct mention of the common beliefs.  Nonetheless, this is a very satisfactory volume - a solid entry filling a real need for appropriate materials in sacramental preparation.	2002-07-02

This is a weaker volume in that it makes many assumptions about family relationships that may not translate into specific family situations:  it makes little allowance for families in which the grandparents converted to Catholicism, for single parent families, for mixed marriages.  It makes more allowance for the parents' (rather than grandparents') generation primarily in terms of non-practicing Catholics.<br />However, for traditional families dealing with handing on the faith in support of (or in spite of) parental religious education especially where physical distance presents a barrier, this volume is useful.	2002-07-02

Pan begins as a nature story - detailed, lush, knowledgeable descriptions of nature, of living a solitary existence, of feeding off the forest and sea.  Phrases such as &quot;there was a sweet sulphurous smell from the old leaves rotting in the woods&quot; lull the reader into an expectation of a pastoral romance novel.  This is anything but.  It is, rather, an exploration of the relationship of the solitary Lt. Glahn with two women in particular and society in general.  Lt. Glahn is socially inept and impulsive.  The two women? One is servile and unavailable; the other, more interested in the power of the chase than the capture.  The resulting story is an intriguing study of human emotions, of motivation and of the honesty of self-revelation.  An excellent book by an excellent author.	2002-07-01

The story of Doruntine is relatively simple - the only daughter of a large family marries a Bohemian man i.e. a two week trip home at best; the brother most attached to her gives his bessa that he will come for her when she needs to travel home; all nine brothers die in a plague infested war; three years later her dead brother comes for her, takes her home; she and her mother die.<br />Kadare places this legend into the investigative hands of a local official Stres.  In his investigation Stres is forced to realize the elusiveness of truth, the \\"necessary\\" dishonesty of authority, his own relationship with Doruntine and wife, the forward thinking ideas that made the brother troublesome.  Stres ultimately opts for bessa, that elusive honesty and social contract.<br />Don't start this book if you don't have time to read it straight through; it is riveting.  However, it does have two flaws.  First, in the context of a dead brother transporting Doruntine the comment that only Jesus Christ has arisen from the dead is used repeatedly; Lazarus appears to be forgotten.  Secondly, while careful rereading might clear the confusion, I was left with a feeling of inconsistency between Stres' family life timeline and that of Doruntine's marriage.  Perhaps I ought to knock a star off for these problems but Kadare is an exceptional writer - I gave him the benefit of the doubt.	2002-06-30

His form exudes incredible control of language at its most basic element - syllable (not phoneme if that is what you anticipated).  His poems encourage, even require, multiple readings - to savor the sound, the untwine the meaning.  His language is comparatively complex, using unusual words to build his layered meaning.  Many of the poems explore words, non-existence, ...  Here and there he reminded me of a reverse Jabes - concerned with the present rather than the absent, despite Sobin's concern with non-existent.<br />Examples: &quot;... scriptless wastes, there / where the parched lips, irremediable, had/ gone un-/lettered ...&quot; or &quot;the resuscitation of so many surppressed ur-words by the bias of a yet-to-be articulated grammar.&quot;<br />So why have I given the book a mere three stars?  Some of the poems are excellent but others have perfectly controlled forms but with meaning either too difficult to tease out or apparently unclear in the mind of the poet.  These poems sometimes come across as intellectual pride ... that to me is a fatal flaw in poetry.	2002-06-30

In a handful of incidents with a maid's life, Flaubert provides us with a full character which exhibits a quiet, uneducated saintliness that weathers a life of significant hardship.  The text is down-to-earth realistic description with simple items such as a map illustrating her complete lack of education and a (stuffed) parrot which the priest recognizes the importance of in a final gesture to the servant.

Eggplant, burdock, cabbage, ginger, turnips, rape flower, garlic, plums, daikon, pineapple, kumquats, ... a wide variety of ingredients serve as the base for these pickles.  The book shows step by step how to pickle and serve these foods in glorious style.<br />As an added bonus for the adventuresome, several of these vegetable pickles can also substitute nicely for South Asian pickled vegetables.  The \\"Pickled Seven Vegetables\\" can be used as a chutney or salsa.  \\"Asparagus in Mustard Soy Sauce\\" and \\"Grilled and Poached Peppers\\" can serve as side dishes.

It would help if the basics of every day life - the manditory duties of the priest, the caring for the sheep - were in the general vicinity of accurate.  It would help if the book had a cohesive view of the magic, ritual, hallucinagenic substances, reincarnation etc. that make up the core of the plot.<br />It should be obvious that I don't care for this coming-of-age, gay masochist novel.  What makes it most frustrating is that here and there one reads flashes of excellent writing - enough so that this book may have an historical place in gay erotica.  But for general reading, save your \\"to read stack\\" for better materials.	2002-06-27

The format is identical - reflection on some aspect, questions for thought, quotes from the rite, Scripture and Catechism.  The maturing into sharing the meal as a member of the Christian family as a child moves from high chair to table is the primary image used is at times pushed a bit too far.

The structure of the books in the series is similar - information on a topic, a series of useful reflection questions, and quotes from the rite, Scripture and the Catechism.  This volume relates confession/penance/reconciliation to the internal workings of a family.  It begins with distinguishing guilt from shame, and follows step by step a child's maturing into understanding of moral responsibility/guilt.  It quietly encourages parents to support their child's reception of the sacrament by recognition of the failings of adults - our \\"I'm sorry's\\" teach a child to be sorry.<br />The book has solid sacramental theology and has succeeded in achieving a balance acceptable to liberal/conservative wings within the Church.	2002-06-14

While avoiding the complication of precise terminology so that the book reads easily, it does distinguish the varying states of the &quot;candidate&quot; as inquirer, catechumenate, candidate, neophyte, elect ... and of the various roles RCIA sponsor, godparent, confirmation sponsor ...<br />The information regarding the expectations of the sponsor through the full RCIA process is excellent; it is supplemented by thoughtful questions, quotes from the Catechism, Scripture and the Rite.  It's only drawback is that it makes a number of assumptions about parishes that may be untrue of many parishes. Because of this, it should be provided as information that supplements the training provided by the parish not in lieu of parish training.<br />This whole series of &quot;Handing on the Faith&quot; is solid and should be accessed any time you are seeking for resources in this area.	2002-06-13

Along the way one meets the fiancee he can't get rid of, a curate with a hell-fire-brimstone manner and a wife who is spoiled and childish, lay-helpers with hidden hatreds ... a whole village of believable characters acting in very human ways.<br />This is not a deep, philosophical novel but through the characters' actions there is a sense of hopefulness that overpowers the foibles.	2002-06-12

I also believe he knew little about Tibet - for a collection of humorous Tibetan folktales see Tales of Uncle Tompa.  It will give an accurate flavor of Tibet humor.  As for the sources of Tibetan Buddhism that Delattre gives, they are on the theosophic edge; they were the most available.  He does not mention Evans-Wentz, the most accurate translator of Tibetan Buddhism available at the time the stories were written.  The result is that the religious philosophy expressed in these stories has little to do with the title.<br />If, however, you consider these stories to be religious tales in the same sense as tales of Mulla Nasrudin, the jataka tales, rabbinical midrashim etc., several of the stories work quite well.  Those that fail include those Delattre recognizes as failures in the foreward and those where he fails to trust his story and falls into explanation.  To give a taste of the tales:<br />Pyramid Lake is a reenactment as ritual of a very old custom of limiting a king's reign to 9 years, then burying him in a lake where he will be reborn as a fish.  As the Dalai Lama is encased in mud in the ritual reenactment, he changes from boy to man.<br />Seven Puffs on a Cigarette is a clever story of the boy's love of camels and an attempt by Camel cigarettes to get an endorsement.<br />A Confucian Reprimand is a funny tale combining a typical boy's untidy room with an obsession for order.<br />\\"Everyone Loves the Beautiful Death of Soldiers\\" is a didactic tale that, while imperfect as a story, carries its message well.<br />What the book does best, however, is give insight into how little was known about Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism before the Chinese occupation sent refugees out of Tibet and into western consciousness.  As a period piece, this book is excellent.	2002-06-08

But with Woodrell the rough, rowdy and savage characters are very human - embracing both the good life and destructive fate with humor.  Although the cover blurb leads one to expect Rene Shade as a major character, he is a sideline.  His father John X. and ten-year-old half sister Etta are at the center of the story.  Etta keeps her aged father going, getting him his first drink of the morning, serving sandwiches and beer at his poker games, and reading his every move ... sassing him back with his own words.  This is a kid who cons her Dad into believing school starts November 9 for public school students, thus avoiding school.  She is a memorable survivor.<br />Two love interests assist in creating a coherent image of the Shade family.  Rene has fallen for a basketball player who is as unsure as he as to what future she wants.  Tip has fallen for Gretel who is currently living in a home for pregnant women putting children up for adoption. Gretel is the product of a hippie couple surviving in the back woods on the standard government property cash crop and proud of their lack of conveniences.  While she understands marriage to be a kind of death, living in a house with plumbing is a major life goal.<br />The plot would be predictable if it were not for humorous turns of fate.  John X. is on the lam - his pursuer attempts to increase his capital by scamming a tourist couple who are scam artists themselves.  A cockolded husband who's held a grudge for 40 years, goes to kill the agressor only to die of a heart attack ...<br />The writing is good quality - with turns of phrases here and there that are pleasant, memorable and believable surprises in the otherwise harsh environment.<br />So if you want to kick back, turn your mind off and read for sheer pleasure, Daniel Woodrell has again fit the bill.	2002-06-08

Basic rules for visiting the sick<br />2. A format for a prayer service<br />3. Prayers and Scripture readings to flesh out the format.<br />The basic rules for visiting are solid advice drawn from A Thoughtful Word, A Healing Touch of Joseph M. Champlin and Susan Champlin Taylor.  The additional rules added by DeGidio are excellent - including the family, use of symbolism, etc.  These or similar rules should be part of the training for any minister to the sick.<br />The format for the prayer service is in keeping with the official service for distribution of communion to the sick.  Through prayers and Scripture for specific situations and through prayers in the form of litanies, it provides opportunity to response to more specific situations - stroke, cancer, surgery, lost of an infant ...  For the Scriptural selection for these 15+ situations I highly recommend the book.<br />The weakness of the book is that there are phrases in the prayers that could be inappropriate for a number of people - inappropriate as in outside their theology or knowledge e.g. &quot;your sacrament of pain and suffering&quot; or &quot;St. Juliana Falconieri&quot;.  There are also no Marian prayers, yet for many of the elderly the Rosary is their primary personal devotion.<br />There is nothing &quot;wrong&quot; with what I see as a weakness.  It is merely that the individuals most apt to use this book are precisely those most uncomfortable with improvising prayers to fit the spirituality of the person with the illness and those supporting that individual.  Therefore, while I think this is a solid book for training, I'm uncomfortable recommending it as a ritual book.	2002-06-07

Here, however, it is the story of collectors of the epics and the internal security officers of Albania that are the heart of the story - a very funny story poking fun at ignorance, fear, position ...<br />When the Irish researchers arrive, the governor's wife has day dreams of an affair, the office of the Interior Ministry has dreams of snaring the perfect biographer, the governor is out to snare the spies with counterspies who don't know English, a Serbian monk who tries to insure that the epics are recognized as Serbian not Albanian ...<br />This book is an absolute joy to read - a witty commentary on totalitarian government and the manipulation of people.	2002-06-07

The strength of this novel is the incredible way Nooteboom through words, allows us to see the world as Arthur sees it - he processes visual images not words or logical formulations.  We are drawn into his experience of verbal overload, of stumbling to say in words what is known in visual or aural images.<br />The second success of the novel is it's accurate portrayal of a specific intellectual time - Hegel, Camus, Volans, Pedereski, Hildegard ... it was so familar as to be eerie ... for the novel Berlin with Dutch, German, Russian individuals.  And yet in some strange way the same as my college days in rural Wisconsin with students from Uganda, Honduras ...  In some way Nooteboom has captured the intellectual life of an era and successfully made it universal.<br />Throughout the novel - verbally and by plot - the volume addresses the issue of history - personal, recent, and ancient.  The juxtaposition of Arthur's visual record of history, of his friend's intellectual understanding and of his &quot;girl friend's&quot; archival search for history is effective at forcing the reader to think.  Often this is done by small details - a statue that fallen still has a cap in place where a real cap would have fallen off, the timeless sound of conches in Japanese monasteries, the sound of tires on wet pavement ...<br />This is a novel that challenges the way you perceive the world rather than simply presenting the challenge that Arthur is facing.  Arthur having lost wife and child in an airplane accident is forced to reevaluate his world.  The novel says the rest of us should do so without a prod like Arthur's.	2002-06-06

This is also a book that deserves part of both the scorn and praise heaped on it by other Amazon reviewers.<br />The problem with the book is that the plot is too carefully contrived.  The book requires three parallel lives - the wife of the archivist, the wife of T.S. Eliot, and a graduate student poet.  The plot is written with parallels too close to be believable; it is as if the author did not trust us to make the connections.  However, the use of Eliot's poetry - as well as that of Auden and LeRoi Jones - make the overdone plot interesting.<br />The strength of the book is putting the \\"big questions\\" of life into emotional life rather than intellectual life - self-identity, religious conversion, and responsibility/guilt - are tied to marriage, fear, work ethics, child rearing, jazz ...<br />The author has the good sense to raise the questions without offering answers.  Rather than answers, she often illustrates possible answers from Christian, Jewish, and assimilated Jewish perspectives.<br />As for the reviewer who objected to the \\"ivory tower intellectual\\" description of University employees (e.g. the archivist), I dare say that as a long-time University employee, that there certainly are some.  That is to say that the archivist has a reasonable and consistent portrait and his immediate boss seems well-grounded in administration.<br />This isn't one of the top ten novels of the century but it is entertaining and will leave some ideas to chew on when your done.	2002-06-04

(Yes, here and there I loved the author's wordplay.)<br />Chapter 8 is a perceptive consideration of blessings and the Beatitudes, bringing to life what has become trite.<br />Chapter 9 considers ways to find the meaning in difficult passages - unknown names for people and places, genealogies, vengeful behavior or prayers, legal codes ...

The Andalusian poet is a contemporary of Lorca, Dali etc.  In his brief autobiographic note, he states that these poems were written at night in a frenzy.  I believe him. At least three-quarters of the poems have a sense of being inspired rather than crafted i.e. as if they came as whole to the poet, i.e. as if they came directly from within as an expression of state-of-being rather than being created consciously by the artistic intellect.<br />Within the poems there is a significant variety in structure and tone although most share a sense of disorientation.  There are very inventive images which absolutely fit in the poem although standing alone, that seems impossible.  Throughout the poems there was only one image that jarred, one (to my mind) misplaced \\"piano\\".  Some examples: \\"Ah yes. A suit of clothes went by / uninhabited, hollow\\" or \\"The earth was an enemy, / because it fled. / The sky an enemy, / because it never stopped.\\"<br />This volume is bilingual - something I appreciate (or demand) in translations of poetry.

When I had read about 20 pages, I had to start over to determine if I had missed a transition in the storyline or if the author had omitted the transition - the latter being the correct answer.  In Mr. Potter the circular language almost demands that you read out loud - or at least form the words in your mind - if you are to follow the story.  In that sense, I did not enjoy reading this book as I had her earlier works.<br />However, by the end of the book I had to be in awe of the author.  She succeeded in presenting both the despair and the wisdom of being inconsequential.  She accurately presented individuals as being shaped by small details such as a line drawn through the father section of a birth certificate.  She presented the similarity in displacement whether a rich Lebanonese businessman, a Vienese doctor, or an African slave.  Through that similarity of displacement, she made a strong social statement about the relationship of the &quot;have's&quot; and the &quot;have not's&quot;.<br />The story line is simple - a boy is born without his father claiming him, his mother leaves him as a servant boy while she commits suicide, he learns to drive, he becomes a chauffeur, he has many daughters - one of which is the narrator, he becomes a successful cabbie, he dies.  However, through this simple story, through language that is simple and difficult simultaneously, Kincaid crafted a realistic, wise, critical depiction of humanity.  I'm impressed.	2002-06-02

The man is a 55 year-old academic who loves his wife and feels sexually inadequate.  The woman is a 44 year-old traditional Japanese housewife, sexually both repressed and voracious.  Their college-aged daughter is cool to the young man her parents present as a potential husband.  The young man appears to be more interested in Mother than in daughter.<br />Through the diaries one observes the internal workings of the marriage.  The husband hides from himself everywhere except in his diary.  His wife hides from herself even in the diary.  Each expects the other to \\"snoop\\" so that they can communicate through their writing what they cannot speak openly.  And they use their sexual relationship as the metaphor for their entire relationship.<br />The author has done an excellent job of uncovering the ambiguity often present in relationships and the complexity of knowing even one's own motivations.	2002-06-02

It was rejected not on doctrinal grounds but on grounds that the anonymous author was not in the direct apostolic line i.e. an apostle or companion / disciple of an apostle.  Robert Van de Weyer has provided a very readable condensation of the book.<br />The book itself consists of revelations including parables, commandments, etc. from which contrition and a desire to know God's ways are enhanced. The primary characters of the revelation are women personifying the Church and/or various virtues and angels especially a \\"guardian angel\\" or shepherd. Mountains, stones and trees are frequent images in the building up of the Church or in the judgment of Christians. The recipient of the revelation is an unlettered Christian slave; this leads to an emphasis on understanding with the heart rather than intellectual knowledge.<br />To give a bit of the flavor of the book, the twelve commandments received by and explained to the slave are:<br />1. Believe that God is one<br />2. Be as simple and innocent as a little child<br />3. Love truth<br />4. Keep your minds free of any impure thoughts<br />5. Be courageous and yet prudent<br />6. Control your temper<br />7. Always keep faith<br />8. Fear the Lord, and keep his commandments<br />9. Show temperance<br />10. Ensure that you are not two-minded or hypocritical<br />11. Be joyful<br />12. Put away from yourself all evil desire, and put on yourself only desires which are good and holy.<br />This book is useful for those interested in early Christianity or as devotional reading.	2002-05-30

The original printing was in 1907- a fact that is evident in the introduction and notes.  The discovery of significantly more Gnostic texts and an additional century of research has modified the common view and resolved some of the academic debates reflected in the introduction. G.R.S. Mead was a major force in the study of Gnostism, translating Pistis Sophia and Thrice Greatest Hermes as well.  His notes have aged better than the introduction; they are a fount of information - an extensive exploration of the meaning and pronunciation of 'Amen' is information I wish appeared more often in liturgical or biblical commentaries.<br />The core of the book, however, is a ritual poem 'The Hymn of Jesus'.  Mead unobtrustively slips information often relegated to footnotes into the text ... parenthetical common Greek words such as Logos where needed to understand the text, alternative readings and comments of the translator's decisions.  The hymn reads smoothly and the rhythm of a ritual circle dance is clear.<br />While this hymn is clearly Gnostic in origin, it could easily be adapted to contemporary ritual - I'm thinking of the various attempts to create new ritual for women's groups.  Mead would be very unhappy with me for this suggestion.<br />The hymn also provides significant insight into the thinking of early Christians - Gnostic and otherwise.  As such it is great reading for a wide variety of interests.	2002-05-30

It is illustrated by plates of the Latin and translated well by a professor of Classics at the University of Illinois (Urbana).  The translation is very readable.<br />The condensations may be as long 11 or 12 verses or a short as a phrase.  Often they trigger a memory of the Psalm from which they come; this would be even more common among those who regularly pray the Psalms.  Reading the condensations gives an overview of the Psalms as a whole, that is difficult to observe when reading the entire Psalter.  This overview helps place the various psalms in their literary and theological context.<br />One oddity in Bede's abridgment; Psalm 50 not only prefigures Jesus but refers directly to him!  The brief introduction explains this and the single line from Psalm 136 which in no way implies the well-known \\"By the waters of Babylon\\".<br />If you are interested in the early Church in England, liturgy, or a devotional version of the Psalms, this version is well worth exploring.	2002-05-30

The book veers the direction of the metaphysical.  We then follow McCabe thru a series of time shifts in which the 47 year-old McCabe of the story is joined by a younger (or older) McCabe.  McCabe is too \\"find the answer\\" to a question that is unknown even to those manipulating the time continuum.<br />This complex plot requires careful planning which is carried out with some minor flaws.  The disappearance of a couple well known for domestic violence and the death of a teen from an overdose of heroin, seem to be arbitrary devices to start the trajectory of the novel even when one has the \\"why\\" behind the bizarre occurences.  In the final chapters, the author's depiction of McCabe's health and strength seem inconsistent despite the plot at one point explicitly adding strength to McCabe.<br />The story is sprinkled with gentle humor - how G.G. gets his name, the secret language of love, trivia contests based on 50's TV, the dog Old Vertue being identified from a 400 year-old painting...  It is also sprinkled with quotations from other authors that are wise in a 'working-stiff' way.<br />Throughout the story, we see McCabe grappling with who he was, who he is, and who he will become.  The cause of this grappling is standard but inventive sci-fi metaphysical fanatasy.  The book as a whole - an interesting diversion.	2002-05-29

He starts as a shepherd, becomes a minister, kills an overseer who is whipping a young shepherd, emigrates to American, stubbornly leaves the wagon train to make his own way to the California promised land.  We get all the sterotypes with an twist interesting twist - the lower level of the ship crowded with the sick, the Indian chief, the Mexican robber ...  And, if at any point we start to forget the parallels to the story of Moses, we are treated to Biblical quotes and Eleazar's recognition of the parallels.  In addition, we get a heavy handed Old Testament = fire = Protestant = Moses vs. New Testament = water = Catholic = Jesus.<br />The concept of the book is interesting and, if the parallels and comprehensions were the logical outcome of character development, the book would be excellent.  However, the character seems to exist solely to explore the Biblical parallels.<br />As a result, this book is worth reading for those interested in the use of Biblical imagery in literature.  Otherwise, it is an interesting deversion if you have more time than books on your &quot;to read pile&quot;.	2002-05-28

While this volume did not impress me, I am certainly willing to read more of his work.  He writes in a very quiet and observant style; he knows precisely what details will be telling; he can recreate his reactions at an earlier age with astonishing believability.  With only an occassional misstep, his language is precise and well chosen.  Unfortunately, his characters never move beyond the particular to a universal observation of something about humanity and the reader never cares about the particular characters of the stories.<br />The Hiding Place is a slight piece of a ring of sentimental value being &quot;lost&quot; is moving, its sentimental value and hiding place recalled, and it's being returned to it's multilayered hiding place.<br />Musette Disappears is a short character piece of a small girl leaving church - and the memories of her.<br />Blacky's Story is the tale of the family dog, apparently never well trained, his exile, and the family joke/strain surrounding him.<br />The O'Connell Sister is the tale of twin spinisters who were anything but friendly to the neighborhood children.<br />Mr. Pierre is a story of the hairdresser with flair - a gambler, a cheat.<br />Thirst is a paragraph regarding dreams and thirst.<br />I am oversimplifying the stories - but they truly are more sketches, dreams, character studies, memories than stories of a more formal nature.  Essentially a talented author has presented us with a solid collection of author's exercises.	2002-05-28

The author is translating for a general readership, not for other experts.  Therefore his harmonizing of the various sources is designed to be readable - which it is.  He is concentrating on the sources that represent his speciality - Arabic and Coptic; therefore, some familar stories are omitted as are most gnostic sources.<br />The stories included are histories of Joseph, Mary and substantial infancy materials. Also included are a number of early nativity hymns and excerpts of the infancy material in the Quran.<br />The weakness in the book is solely in the Introduction where the author displays a consistent post-Christian, reformation bias, especially with regards to the creation of the New Testament canon.  He does acknowledge the diversity of the canon in Syriac and Coptic versions but never allows that acknowledgment to mitigate his &quot;Catholic power-grap&quot; mentality.<br />While I prefer Maire Herbert's Irish Biblical Apocrypha for fun stories, this volume is far more representative and readable.  It provides excellent background for Medieval mystery plays and some poetry without expecting background in Biblical studies.	2002-05-27

It does require effort to see the relationships between the 21 semi-independent chapters which constitute the narrative.  The story can be summarized very simply: boy born mishappen wins heart of grandfather; father returns from war shell-shocked; father dies; years later mother dies; 30 year old boy move in with distant relative; questions of intelligence, language and identity arise; story ends with suggestion boy is perhaps also author.<br />Along with way the story is told with variable success and with items of symbolic meanings reappearing with limited success at providing continuity.  An example of discontinuity: we leave a young child who speaks a private language with his grandfather.  We jump to a thirty year old who needs a guardian and an assisted care living arrangement ...Whose guardian successfully gets him a job in a movie theater.  While many of the juxtapositions around Jakob are specially intended to force the reader to rethink Jakob's identity, this particular jump feels as if the author himself does not understand the transition.<br />An occasional chapter, such as the story of the young glazier, set up symbols - in this case mirrors - that add little to the scenes in which mirrors become crucial elements of the story.  In a story as tightly written with regards to ambigious identity, this struck me as a flaw.<br />So why four stars?  The book succeeds at simultaneously presenting alternative views of who Jakob is and what he is.  In the private language he first learned and in the film script without words, the book explores language in an interesting way.  In the cumplusive analysis of train schedules, mirrors, motionlessness etc., the book explores the boundary of experienced world and &quot;real world out there&quot;.<br />Definately not a perfect novel, but a good first novel worth your time.	2002-05-27

The structure of the book is fascinating; each chapter begins with a description of Laura which is followed by a human story which feeds Laura.  Laura is the sister of Ms. Death i.e. a \\"spiritual being\\", goddess, angel, shape-changer who seeks all that is wrong/evil/fearful/sad in humans; as such she specifically seeks stories reflecting this kind of existence.<br />Unfortunately, one discovers early in this book that, while it has refreshing images and occasional inventive story, the book as three funamental flaws.  The most critical is the stories of each chapter are supposed to be from a variety of people; however, the language and imagery provide a single tone for all people.  Oops!<br />The second is that the author is enthralled by adjectives, similes and metaphors.  There are far too many sentences using an excess of them.  Each sentence is reasonable alone but piled one upon another they become tiring.<br />The third is that in the first section of each chapter, the section describing Laura, within a single sentence there are contraditory images which do not appear to be literary devices to emphasize her otherness nor to reflect competing images in the story.<br />There are excellent images and a few short poem-stories that are excellent.  Unfortunately, the book as a whole does not exibit this high quality.	2002-05-26

I Know Many Songs, but I Cannot Sing is a much more difficult read than Still Life with Insects but well worth the concentration required.<br />Kitely explored &quot;foreigness&quot; in a variety of forms in Cairo - the American (respectful and disrespectful), Coptic Christian, German Sufi's, Armenian, and a variety of 'native' Egyptians who either by mixed heritage or Western education also are 'foreign'.  Kitely is superb in allowing the Egyptian world-view to be as real as the European world-view at the same time that he emphasizes the contraditions.<br />The story line is seemingly simple ... an Armenian actor begins following an American/European teacher as a practical joke; they become friends an spend a remarkable night in Ramadan going from house/shop/office/prison/street to another.  One cultural is consistently being played off another to provide competing explanations of the events.  Kitely is a master at using the small detail - standing less than a foot away comfortable for Egyptians but not Americans, crooked lanes keeping cities cool while European straight boulevards allow the wind to blow cool night air away ...  With the ever shifting perspective of dream, premonition, police spying, story time, added knowledge, the reader has a sense of being 'foreign' to the novel - a touch of Kiteley's mastery of his form.<br />Neither of Kiteley's novels should be neglected, even if it requires searching the used book market.	2002-05-25

It deserves to be in such esteemed company. Thru the use of short vignettes, many depicting neighbor characters who appear only in one vignette, Cisneros has created a whole Latino subculture, placed it with the American culture, and displayed a young girl's (7th grader or so)coming of age.<br />For Esperanza, coming of age means recognizing the traps of early marriage and low expectations so that she can set off on a path of independence - owning her own \\"home on the hill\\". The author has taken the adage \\"show don't tell\\" to perfection using details to press the story forward: a group of girls purchasing a used bike, the first attempt to wear high heels, shame at wearing brown and white saddle shoes to a christening dance, her dream of letting bums stay in the attic of her own home ...<br />In simple language, plain syntax, and concrete language, Cisneros has written a masterpiece - one so well written that it is the novel not the craftsmanship that shines.	2002-05-24

DeLillo is a master in his use of language - the sentence can be jarring, incomplete, ambiguous, meandering as the plot line requires.  An example: &quot;She moved past the landing and turned into the hall, feeling whatever she felt, exposed, open, something you could call unlayered mayer, it that means anything, and she was aware of the world in every step.&quot;  While I frequent enjoy movels specifically because of their use of language, I found DeLillo's writing jarring - there were sentences I had to reread in order to get the sense of them.  I prefer to reread a sentence for the sensual pleasure of the words.<br />Similarly, I was both impressed and uneasy about his building of character.  He does a splendid job of rooting the body artist in the physical, with an awareness of the physical that had, for me, an almost Zen-like quantity.  This was used to advantage as her experiences after her husband's suicide lead to fluid boundaries of time, space, personhood, reality ... However, in the first chapter which sets up the story I found the discrepancy between her semi-awareness of thought and her physical rootedness created a character out of focus.<br />Nonetheless, while I've not been made a fan of DeLillo, anyone interested in the use of language in contemporary novels should read something by him - and this volume is an excellent choice.	2002-05-23

Thru the first fifth or so of these book, I thought I may have finally found a book by Yoel Hoffmann that I didn't love.  Because of that, I would strongly urge anyone who has read nothing of Hoffmann's to begin with &quot;Katschen &amp; The Book of Joseph&quot; rather than this book.<br />In the small units (chapters? prose poems? fragments?) that make up this book, Hoffman builds an understanding (an impression? an empathy?) for the experience of falling in love.  This woman loves man loves woman loves child loves mother ... story builds within the individual characters, within the world, within the religious universe in unusual connections: &quot;Now his life, too, seems like a story, except that here there occur the same eruptions that take place on the surface of the sun, and he hears the sound of this burning, like the song which is of this world alone: 'Frere Jacques.'&quot;<br /><br />While occasionally a line or image seems contrived in a way not evident in his other works, the results are astonishing.  At the novel's end the reader has seen barriers and loneliness fall away and love flow in to replace them.  This love is physical, sacred and profane as is the world within which the characters live limited (or not?) by time, space, contradition and naming.	2002-05-20

The author refers to various saints - Basil, Benedict, Frances de Sales, Augustine using the title &quot;St.&quot;.  The result is that Christians of all ilks should be comfortable learning from Boa.<br />The introduction to the process of sacred reading is satisfactory.  Boa clearly understands the audience for which he is writing and succinctly provides the necessary background to engage in the 4 steps of the method-less method: reading or lectio, meditation or meditatio, prayer or oratio and contemplation or contemplatio.  Boa provides a justification for the practice of sacred reading in a well-balanced Christian life.<br />The remainder of the book is a collection of 90 Bible passages translated by and occassionally edited by Boa.  These passages appear one to a page in journal format.  The joural entries are identical questions based on the 4 steps with space to write your response.  For readers who need or desire this type of &quot;fill in the form&quot; journals, this is fine.  I personally would prefer to select the passages from a lectionary or Office of Readings ... and use a blank notebook.<br />However, even if you don't use the journal portion, the book provides valuable information on how to teach a simple, non-threatening, non-monastic lectio divina.	2002-05-19

The translations are supported by history of the discovery of the texts, the identification of a site of an early Christian community ...  This material has previously been available only in obscure academic sources or more popular literature's hints that such material exist.<br />This volume is written to appeal to the more general reader and, unfortunately, to readers with a &quot;new age&quot; bent.  Palmer attempts to build parallels between &quot;Celtic Christianity&quot; and the &quot;Church of the East&quot;.  His &quot;Church of the East&quot; is an amalgam of the Nestorians, the Syriac rite Churches (Orthodox, Catholic or Independent), and the Copts (Orthodox, Catholic, or Independent).  In short, his Church history is so simplified as to be false - appealing to an inaccurate (but popular) understanding of the relationship of the Celt's Christianity to that of the broader world.<br />Similarly, he quickly establishes a Tibetian Christian influence on the doctrine of Boddhisattva's without recognition of a competing theory that attributed the changes to Islamic influence.  He also strongly stresses the Taoist adaptations of the Christian texts while minimizing the better documented interchange between Buddhism and Christianity within the Chinese silk route context.<br />I am delighted to finally have the texts available, to see pictures of the artifacts, to have more historical names and dates.  For that I highly recommend the book.  Unfortunately, I can not say the same for his interpretation.  Two times, his support for his view had me laughing.  The number of pages devoted to the Eastern Church in the Penguin History of the Church tells me only the level of interest by Penguin editors not the knowledge of the West of the Eastern Church.  Or, after using the Orthodox iconographic tradition to establish that the finger position of a painting was a mudra of teaching, he jumps to the conclusion that worship in the Chinese Church included mudras.  Does that mean that the Orthodox must also use mudras in worship?<br />Yes, I am being harsh but reading this book uncritically could seriously mislead one.  I have no interest in seeing a &quot;Chinese Nestorian Christian&quot; new-age movement to parallel the Celtic movement.he jumps to the conclusion that worship in the Chinese Church included mudras.

However, by the second poem the reader should recognize that they are in the hands of a master who uses the raw material to create his art not to impress the reader.  Mayes has an unequalled ability to mix in a single poem classical Rome, blue collar America, academia, Italian farming, and Catholic imagery.  In this mixture, one sees a unified and reflective life.  Unlike most poetry I enjoy, Mayes' poetry does not have well-turned phrases or captivating images that cause certain lines to stand out.  Rather, the poems have an internal consistency that discourages focus on individual pieces rather than the whole. Mayes is an uncommonly good contemporary poet, his work well worth getting to know.	2002-05-12

Certain chapters of this slim volume are memorable for the perfect imagery used to describe life lived in music not words or deeds.<br />An example - when Marin Marais tells of his return from the boys' choir to his father's shoe shop, the images of smell, the effect of light upon the leather, the callous on a shoemaker's fingers create an absolutely right image of what Marin as a musician wishes to run from.<br />Another example - when Monsieur de Sainte Colombe commissions a friend to paint a 'reminder' of his late wife's appearance as he plays the lament he wrote upon her death, it is a simple still-life of the work table, the wine flask, the partially eaten sweet that he requests - not a portrait or a ghostly appearance.<br />The most memorable example - Monsieur de Sainte Colombe teaching Marin Marais music, sounds are the sound of a paint brush painting a still-life, the voices of actresses reciting Racine, the sound of a boy's urine hitting fresh snow...<br />Such chapters make the book a seductive read.  Unfortunately, the characterization of people is not as strong as the characterization of the music.  The author never engaged me in the plot, yet the style is one of conventional plot development.<br />The book is flawed but still a marvelous read - well worth the time required to read this slim volume.	2002-05-10

Not this book!<br />This book is a serious, publically accessible study of chaos monsters and religion or, if you prefer, the edges of ordered reality and religion.  From the religious perspective it takes you through the Near Eastern chaos monsters thru Job, the Psalms and Revelations.  It has fascinating observations concerning the monsters of the Hebrew Scriptures as both frightening as God's playthings.<br />Culturally, the book looks at Orientalism, monster flicks, horror fiction and Goth music - as embracing or staving off the chaos monsters.<br />One often wishes that Beal would distribute the attention he gives to detail differently -- Job and Dracula get the most detailed attention.  But one must admit that it is only because ones own interests are differently distributed.  However, the topics that are less detailed have well chosen seminal ideas for the reader to think for themselves!  This encouragement for independent thought around his subject is the result of the author's humility despite the breadth of knowledge he displays.<br />If you have any interest in the dark side of society, this book is well worth your time.	2002-05-08

As a computer nerd, I'd always heard that an article in a 1940's magazine used the model of the Talmud to \\"invent\\" the concept of hypertext which is the conceptual model of the internet.  Therefore, in reading the first section of this book I was bemused by the author's \\"discovery\\" of the similarities between the internet and the Talmud.<br />The subtitle of this book, however, gives an accurate hint of the contents \\"A Journey between Worlds\\".  The book is broad in scope considering a variety of different worlds - Judaism before and after the destruction of the temple, the titled upper class in Scotland before and after the erosion of their wealth and position, European / American Jewish experience in the World War II, ...<br />While the meditation focuses primarily on living with the dichotomies of life rather than forcing an unreal reconciliation on them, there are a handful of sentences that open wide and interesting questions.  For example, he contrasts the Christian \\"the word became man\\" i.e. became embodied with the Jewish experience of the destruction of the temple - seeing the temple to book transistion as the physical becoming \\"word\\".<br />This is an excellent, thought-provoking book that should appeal to anyone with an interest in religious and/or emotional displacement in our rapidly changing and chaotic world.	2002-04-28

I must admit to being a custard fan - custard and junket custard were among my earliest successes so think 7 or 8 years old.  This cookbook greatly expands my custard-based repertoire, especially since dessert cookbooks rarely enter my collection.  This collection of recipes includes detailed instructions to the extent that a novice cook could easily begin here.  It also provides alternatives.  For example, it provides two distinct ways to make &quot;classic&quot; creme brulee. This is followed by 5 pages of variations: Dutch Apple, Bananas Foster, Amaretto Peach, White Russian, Mississippi Mud ...<br />Similarly, a base recipe for Milk Chocolate Caramel Creme Brulee is followed with variations such as Butterscoth Caramel or Orange Carmel.  There are beautiful photos of versions such as Lavender Flower Creme Brulee and Goat Cheese Creme Brulee with Papay Sauce.  Want a variation on bread pudding? try Croissant Pudding with Whiskey Sauce.  Like your food hot? try Ginger Chile Creme Brulee.<br />In short, this small volume has everything you would expect and a fair number of real surprises ... and, more surprising, the suprises work!	2002-04-24

I bought it for the very simple but elegant recipes such as Wilted Amaranth in Pine Nut Dressing, Mixed Vegetables with Peanut Sauce, and Quick Asian Greens Soup.  In all cases the recipes are flexible i.e. one can readily adapt the recipe to the vegetables at hand.  My son, however, focuses on recipes such as Chicken with Thai Basil and Beef Brisket Stew with Daikon.<br />In all cases, ingredients are readily available in an urban area.  The instructions are clear.<br />That is not to say that the recipes are perfect.  Chicken with Thai Basil, for example, is too salty for our taste ... so we cut the fish sauce with sake.  The Asian Vegetable Stew, a recipe that caught my eye when purusing the book, has an excellent flavor but I have yet to find a butternut squash that will cook sufficiently when instructions are religiously followed - so I keep experimenting with how long to cook the squash alone.  However, these recipes are so simple and versatile it takes little effort to adapt to one's own taste.<br />In short, I highly recommend this cookbook.	2002-04-24

Thus one gets such complex recipes as \\"Parsley Leaf Potatoes\\" (roast russet potatoes and top with flat leaf parsley) and \\"Parsley Potatoes\\" (steam new potatoes and top with snipped parsley) ... Well it does get the author to his 1001 recipes more quickly.  One also gets recipes that you must be a kid to appreciate - fish sticks wrapped in crescent dinner rolls.<br />But once one gets past some of the absurdities, the cookbook provides some very good introductions to basic home cooking flavors and mixtures: corn with bell peppers, fresh green peas with garlic, curried green beans, cucumbers in sour cream.  It's strength, however, is that it moves beyond the standard pantry:<br />dandelion greens, eggplant parmigiana, bamboo shoots with chili sauce, shallots, steamed taro with swiss chard.<br />The recipes never exceed 4 ingredients plus pantry items.  The instructions require only minimal cooking experience.  Occasionally the recipe includes variations but the normal pattern is for variations to be separate recipes.<br />The recipes are printed 3 to a page - a random sample pair of pages gives an idea of the breadth of the material: on the left \\"Pressed Lamb Loaf with Herbs\\", \\"Prosciutto with Pasta Sauce\\", \\"Quick Lamb Fricassee\\"; on the right \\"Quick Ham and Pineapple\\" \\"Red Flannel Hash\\" and \\"Rice and Cheese with Frankfurters\\".  The odd juxtapositions provide entertainment when one scans for a recipe.<br />Even an experienced cook will find some interesting recipes, but the real value of this cookbook is for those just learning what might go with what.	2002-04-24

Through this they guide the reader to listen for the space between objects compared, to observe the &quot;grand scheme&quot; implied in the particular, to note how the &quot;obvious&quot; is unobserved and surprising.<br />An example from the introduction of this last point: &quot;... a sycamore leaf / falls softly / and rests / on its own shadow&quot;<br />The poems are like haiku in that they are minimalist and nature based.  However, the sensibility of the cosmic purpose present in these poems differs from the sensibility of cosmic nowness of the (Zen) haiku tradition.<br />An example: &quot;... the clock /reads seven minutes to seven&quot; reads in these poems as &quot;seven&quot; intentionally invoking cultural connotations.  In haiku, it would more likely read as factual observation ... enlightened observation, perhaps, but observation.<br />The book is beautifully printed, Persian and English side by side, one poem per page.  The poems must be read slowly, allowing the visual image time to form in your mind... but what perfect visual images ... images to savour and explore.  My one regret ... I cannot read the Persian in this bilingual edition.	2002-04-18

I became a fan of Emmanuel Carrere's work when The Mustache was first published in English.  I was impressed by the growth in Carrere's skill in The Class Trip.  Unfortunately, The Adversary struck me as simply a pleasant summer read. I must admit, however, that true crime is not my favorite genre.<br />The problem with The Adversary is inherent in its subject - the criminal himself has lived so many lies that he has no idea of who he really is.  Carrere in depicting Romand as honestly as possible depicts a &quot;generic lie&quot; person ... a person who &quot;exists&quot; only to the extent that other individuals substantiate ... even if Romand, himself, does not remember.  In this context, Carrere is forced to insert himself into the story, explaining both how he came to write the story and some of the difficulties in doing so.<br />The result is an excellent semi-journalistic account of Romand's life and trial - probably an excellent book for those with an interest in true crime stories.  For those whose enjoyment is in Carrere's ability to depict human fear, confusion, horror this book is ultimately unsuccessful.  Romand is so far from the norm that insight into his plight sheds little light on the human plight.	2002-04-18

Carroll is an excellent storyteller, weaving story within story ... I especially appreciated his German folktale without an ending.  He does an excellent job of reinterpreting events in light of later understanding (self-understanding) of the characters.  He illustrates the \\"seven degrees of separation\\" by the constant discovery of interrelationships between the characters.  He easily blends multiple world views/realities into a coherent whole.  The result is a book that keeps you reading, awaiting the next revision of your understanding of the storyline and of the motivation of the characters.  This revision literally continues to the last page.<br />My disappointment - the story depends upon an acceptance of a division of humanity into \\"them\\" and \\"us\\".  Given the ordinariness of Miranda in the first section of the novel, I found it difficult to buy into her \\"otherness\\" - more difficult to accept than the alternative worldviews that caused the volume to be placed in the \\"fantasy\\" reading section.<br />I will certainly read additional books by Jonathan Carroll, expecting that other books will not share this flaw.	2002-04-14

This background is important to understanding the mixture that comprises this volume. There are poems that are interesting and clever that have housewife appeal such as \\"To the Happy Wife With a Fatal Flaw\\" which begins \\"A wife who lost her shopping list\\". There are competent poems that appeal to the poet-artist crowd such as \\"Ephesus\\" which includes the lines \\"I remember you with Gibbon / with an armlock on philosophers / dragging me home from empty talk\\". And sprinkled through the collection are a handful of brillant poems or at least poems with brillant lines. Example from \\"Recipe\\" in the context of answering what husbands are made from \\"Earnest, putting Genesis / into their heads. \\"<br />I can't really recommend the book as a whole - yet it is well worth reading for the lines and poems that absolutely work.<br />So why do the author's other careers matter? They explain the politican/diplomat's ability to in each poem write to a particular constituency ... to the degree that there is no poem in the book that one is unable to imagine an individual who would deem the poem \\"brilliant\\".

It is therefore appropriate, I suspose, to translate the Judeo-Christian prayer book, i.e. the Psalms, into a Zen Buddhist conceptual world.<br />In his search for why the Psalms have retained their value as a prayer book over 3000 years, the Buddhist monk Norman Fischer finds a translation of ideas that works for him. For example, he sees the Psalms' concept of the sovereignty of God as a particular kind of consciousness, related to the mindfulness of Buddhism. In this scheme wickedness is unmindfulness and hence alienation; enemies are internal as much as external.<br />Many of these translations work in that they make one see the Psalm in a new way ... they serve as a catalysis for a new understanding. Their translation is poetic ... the volume is worth reading simply as poetry. However, the volume is not appropriate either in style or in content, to serve as a Psalter for daily prayer.<br />Place this volume in the same category as The Psalms in Haiku - a useful and thought-provoking version of the Psalms to turn to when the Psalter is growing old ... to return to for renewing the freshness of your understanding of the psalms.	2002-04-08

This book is of interest to anyone who enjoys good stories and Chamoiseau's use of language.<br />Examples of the tales:<br />The Rainmaker is a tale of disbelief in the ability of a rainmaker - disbelief that leaves the people with misery.<br />Lil' Fellow the Musician is a tale of a child with magical musical abilities - whose lack of caution is his downfall.<br />Ti-Jean Horizon is a delightful trickster tale in which the trickster &quot;steals&quot; his birthright.<br />The Most Beautiful One Is Under the Tub is a tale where a parrot's nonsense ultimately is meaningful - in the right situation.<br />The stories are told in an oral style but not in a simple style.  An example: &quot;So she was famine's best friend, which proves without a doubt that a friendship is not necessarily one of life's true pleasures.&quot;  But this book is pure pleasure.	2002-04-04

He does so in an amazing manner - creating a folk-custom of quivering, an all night vigil of mourning and remembrance, which is juxtaposed against a ultra-scientific world view.  Similarly human emotion is juxtaposed against natural inevitibility.<br />Chapters alternate between the dead of the title - a couple, both middle-aged zoologists - and the \\"quivering\\" - recounting their life together from their original meeting until their death.  The chapters of \\"being dead\\" are detailed, scientific descriptions of the process of flesh decaying.  Yet despite the objectivity, through use of landscape and language, Crace succeeds in making the story move foreward in these chapters.<br />The \\"quivering\\" chapters provide the biography of the couple, primarily through the wife's experience.  The sense of what draws the couple together and what drives them apart is equisite - a realistic view of a long marriage.<br />As the couple's disappearance is noted and their estranged daughter Syl accepts their death, the reader is lead to see in her distinct resemblances to her mother.  This leaves the reader, at the end, with a sense of the circularity of nature.<br />Sprinkled through the book are paragraphs of a philosophical nature.  I personally disagree with the proffered views but find them absolutely right for the characters to which they are attached (even when the character is the narrator).  As such, I see this as an ideal book for a \\"book club\\" discussion, although I can scarcely envision a book club which consider reading such a difficult topic.	2002-03-30

Because when I ordered it, I expected new stories rather than reprints from The Blue Lantern (see it for a review of the stories).  However, if you've never read Pelevin, this is a small collection to get you started.  The mystical chickens Hermit and Six-Toes are unforgettable.  A commune from the perspective of a shed, the transformation of public bathrooms to trinket store ... Pelevin provides a funny and deep insight into human nature, especially the Russian variety.	2002-03-15

He retains a Western poetic bent -Allen Ginsberg, John Donne, Virginia Woolf, Philip Larking are all present by allusion or dedication.<br />His poetry covers a wide range of implied beliefs - the title poem is highly environmental, \\"The Pilgrim\\" a reflection on Tannhauser, \\"Mother Goose Revisited\\" a reflection on childhood and sexual roles ... The depth I expected from the author's long practice of Buddhism is absent.  Rather the book presents an erratic collection that is likely appreciated by those who know the man behind the poems - but which do not stand on their own.	2002-02-21

There are charts which succinctly show the emphasis of particular accounts by charting the number of verses in particular books spent on the history of specific individuals.

Through stories of food - cooking and/or eating - Reichl provides an autobiography concentrating on but not limited to the influences that led her to become a restaurant critic and food magazine editor. The story also reflects the cultural changes in American food patterns as she moves from wealthy Aunt Birdie's wedding menu, her classmate's French father gourmet meals, her mother-in-law's middle American out-of-the-can meals, through Diet for a Small Planet vegetarian coop, into a very multicultural sense of taste.<br />What strikes one most about the book is the author's sense of food both as art and as social glue - views she has the good sense to allow the stories to show rather than the author telling.  Recommended for anyone who enjoys cooking ... and perhaps for those who consider cooking drugery ... it may change their minds.	2002-01-22

Through a narrative that explores these and other questions regarding the relationship between reality-book-reader, Martin Nakell has written a novella that enthralls a reader in snare of inconsistencies in our relationship to the written word.<br />Nakell's interest in the disordered letters contrasts with Jabes' interest in the margins, the space between letters.  Of the two Nakell is the easier read, Jabes is a greater challenge to one's values.  So read both :-)	2001-10-03

Keene has given us an example.  In telling of his upbringing in St. Louis, we learn of the flight of whites from the suburbs into which Afro-Americans had moved, we learn of the heritage of the city as multi-cultural, of growing up with an alcoholic parent, of growing up gay etc.  Only occasionally is the narrative &quot;personal&quot; in the sense of revealing something about the narrator which we could not know without the self-revelation  of the narrative.  The result is wonderful prose, interesting structure, and literature that exists only for itself - never revealing something new, specific about the human condition.	2001-10-03

Just as Wendell Berry can point out unspoken assumptions, sloppy logic and dangerous potential application of concepts in Consilience by Edward O. Wilson, so one could critique Berry's book while being &quot;truthful&quot;.  However, there are several concepts in Berry's work that are worth further thought:<br />Berry sees science as interested in &quot;knowing&quot; while arts and humanities are interested in &quot;doing, responding&quot;.  This has interesting consequences in the definition of &quot;knowing&quot; and of &quot;liberal arts education&quot;.<br />Berry sees science as generalizing, simplifying while experience is always specific and complex.  With the raise of chaos, complexity and entanglement in scientific theory, science is itself beginning to recognize the dissonance between experience and scientific explanation.  As Berry recognizes, literature and poetry normally explore the general human condition through a very specific instance.<br />Berry sees science as dividing the world into the known and the not yet known.  To this Berry wishes to add the category of mystery i.e. unknowable by the limited human capacity.<br />If any of the points described above interest you, this book is well worth your time whether you agree or disagree with Berry's position.	2001-10-03

One hears the voices of a slave whom maintains his dignity in spite of his position, of an overseer to fathers a child with a young slave, of a plantation owner whose views lead him to act with kindness towards his slaves to his social detriment, of the owner's daughter who dreams of emancipation of slaves ... each responding to the life and death of an intelligent young slave with dreams of being a poet.  The net result is a book that allows one insight into the institution of slavery - the mindset that permits a master/slave relationship; that shows the economic forces that weakened the value of slavery and helped percipitate the events leaading up to the Civil War.<br />This is not a book that you will easily forget - rather it is one that forces one to consider the interrelationships between people - past or present.	2001-09-22

This story is told in the casual voice of a village narrator a generation later than the events described.  The casual organization and short digressions carefully support the villager image of the narrator.  The &quot;affair&quot; which serves as plot is a complex of human relationships: an iron-monger for whom the novel is named, a somewhat older veterinarian who is a friend of the entire family, a neighbor girl infatuated with the iron-monger, the publically presentable wife, the ugly mistress, the gossiping butcher's wife ... the relationships reflect the complexity of real life which support the plot without being simplified.  The conclusion may surprise some readers, others will predict it as the only possible consequence of the events which precede.<br />I have yet to be disappointed by Marta Morazzoni; I encourage others to delight in her prose.	2001-09-18

Much to my surprise, this is a book very easy to set down and down and down.  The structure of the book is innovative and effective.  Each of the three sections begins by setting the scene not through coherent sentences but through sentence pieces which describe precisely and poetically the scene.  The sense is very similar to how a participant would observe the scene.<br />The plot is built through a series of short entries of days identified by their religious calendar designation.  Interspersed are snippets of an after-the-fact investigation into the events surrounding the postulate Mariette.  The excerpts of spiritual readings (lectio divina) accompanying the meals are used to establish the mind-set in which the events occur.  This complex structure melds into very readable prose that presents the characters and plot in an interesting and effective manner.<br />Unfortunately, the characters, even prominant characters, are not given sufficient personality to become truly human - they state their emotions rather than display them.  This causes the reader to question if the author knows whether the events at the center of the novels - the stigmata of Mariette - are real, the result of hysteria, or self-inflicted.  This causes the multiple responses to the stigmata to appear arbitrary - not the outgrowth of experience and personality.<br />Reading this novel never causes one to care about the characters or reflect upon the questions raised by the novel.  Only the writing style keeps the reader's attention.	2001-09-16

Examples:<br />Missy is a tale of children's cruelty to each other in the context of an invitation to a birthday party for the purpose of humiliating a guest.  This story has a touch of voodoo.<br />Two stories (Friendship and The Double) deal with the growth of doubles - one growing from an apparent tumor, the other growing from feet which detached themselves from their original body.<br />Replacement of / detaching of heads is another common motif e.g.Aunt Rose and Uncle Friedle.<br />Alchemy, murder, sex, shoes all make multiple appearences - used equally in humor and horror.<br />A few of the stories carry serious meaning i.e. &quot;Saida&quot; which is dedicated to Salman Rushdie which explores religious rigidity;  or A Lunatic's Apprentice which spoofs gullibility and false religiosity.<br />Many of the stories, however, are merely well written insights into Ducornet's imagination.  Or, put another way, the collection has more Lovecraft and less Schulz than I would prefer.  Nonetheless, I will watch for additional short fiction by this inventive author.	2001-09-04

This book is not intended to be &quot;interesting&quot; - it is strictly practical.  It contains charts of dates and the reference for the Bible passage to be read that day.  Plan 1 reads the entire Bible (from a Catholic definition of canon) in 1 year; it aims at 20-30 minutes of reading a day.  Plan 2 reads the Bible in two years paralleling the two year weekday lectionary cycle as much as practical; it aims at 10-25 minutes of reading a day.  Plan 3 reads the Bible in 3 years; it aims at 5-7 minutes of reading a day.<br />In addition, there is a schedule of readings for Advent, Christmas, Lent and Easter - seasonal readings for the liturgical year.<br />In short, a useful book for those wanting a schedule by which to read Scripture.	2001-09-02

He is fired for his intellectual curiosity, especially, charting productivity against alcohol consumption.  While the novel starts as a realistic narrative, one is given early hints of what is to come e.g. angels guiding the narrator to possible sources of alcohol.  As the narrator drinks more, the tale moves from realistic to absurd to surrealistic - abruptly turning realistic at the conclusion.  It is as the story turns unrealistic that the reader is given real insight into the Russian soul - literary culture, musical culture, religion.  The writing is exquisite - a mixture of poetic and coarse that reflects perfectly the attitude of the speaker and communicates perfectly to the reader.<br />Consider this a must read.	2001-08-22

The saints explored are Patrick, Brigid, Brendan, Columba, Aidan, Cuthbert, Iltut, David, Mungo, Piran, Kevin, Colman, Owen and &quot;Comgan&quot;.  The stories are well-told, common tales of the saints with an emphasis on the animal-saint relationship.<br />The book itself is a well-designed &quot;gift&quot; book with lavish Celtic borders and illustrations of the saints - usually in stained glass.

The opening stanza sets the tone for the exploration: &quot;My religion makes no sense / and does not help me / therefore I pursue it.&quot;  It draws from Beethoven's life, from Teresa of Avila, from the apophatic theology ...<br />&quot;TV men&quot; mixes Greek heroes and Gods with filming - meet Hector and Socrates in a new environment.  &quot;The Fall of Rome: A Traveller's Guide&quot; explores personal relationships (or lack thereof) when language becomes a barrier not a bridge.  &quot;Book of Isaiah&quot; explores the mindset behind the Biblical text of Isaiah.<br />The strength of this book is that the vast knowledge behind the writing is made accessible to the reader rather than being required of the reader.  This is a book that makes the reader want to read more of the author's work.	2001-07-08

This book is an interplay with a collection of Aztec incantations collected in the early 17th century.  It includes translations, a glossary and an extensive bibliography in addition to the poetry by Alarcon.  The book is primarily for lovers of poetry but is useful to anyone with an interest in MesoAmerican culture and religion.<br />Alarcon's poetry is typical of his style - extremely spare depending heavily on its images and the connotations (as opposed to the denotations) of words.  In this particular book where the number of poems in each section is determined by Aztec associations, a few of the poems are a handful of words - a snippet of a phrase.  Some of these work in much the same way haiku works - but a few fail as poetry.  The longer poems are consistently successful - either as new incantations or as comtemporary poetry.	2001-07-08

Having read the book I have a far more ambivalent opinion - the concept for the book is excellent, the photography is excellent, the research for quotations is excellent - but the book is filled with over-simplifications. For example, it refers to the &quot;Boddhisatva&quot; ideal in Buddhism as if were basic - in fact, the southern school of Buddhism does not share this as an ideal.  It refers to the practice of clearing the mind and non-attachment as if this separated mind from body and nature, whereas many of the traditions see these practices as making one more aware of the physical world as it is i.e. minus the distorting factor of mind.  It refers to the washing of feet as &quot;little known&quot;, an editorial comment that would puzzle most Catholics and other &quot;high church&quot; Christians.  It speaks of gifts of the spirit (charisms) as if they belong to an exclusively Pentecostal strain of Christianity.<br />While the book occasionally notes its oversimplification, I am not comfortable with balance it achieves.  It is, however, an excellent way to introduce the concept of physicality in prayer.  It's photos and text firmly place physical prayer into the mainstream of religious practice and firmly negate any &quot;new age&quot; or &quot;new fangled&quot; charges leveled against it.	2001-07-06

In Rot she fulfills all that was &quot;promised&quot; by the earlier book. (Not that the intervening books are bad, they simply don't meet the high expectations set by the earlier work.)  Rot is the final installment of a trilogy Flesh Made Word that includes Collaborators, The Body in Four Parts and Rot; however, Rot stands alone equally well.<br />Rot is an exploration of the death of a father, and an exploration of what death means to this particular father - a tobacco farmer, a pacifist, a Mennonite, a reader of biographies especially of dictators ...  He is a man who does things &quot;his way&quot; whose friend and granddaughter are equally independent.  He is philosophical but in a quiet, unobstrusive way - with a physicality of thought.  And example: &quot;My father tells me a person should not take longer to die than to be born.  You slipped in, my father says.  Your mother didn't blink.&quot;<br />The book plays the father-daughter relationship off Stalin/Svetlana (Stalin's daughter), off the relationship with the daughter revealing the complexity of the relationship and the variety of ways love is expressed and recognized/not recognized as well as how the same external actions may express power rather than love.<br />This a pure gem of a book, an excellent evening's read.	2001-07-04

It includes questions to consider that make it very appropriate for group training.  It includes short descriptions of good and bad liturgy so that it teaches by example as well as by instruction.  It also makes reference to the official documents of the Church in a manner that will lay to rest concerns about encroaching on the domain of the ordained clergy.  Add to this a solid sense of liturgy by the author and one has good training material.<br />The book covers the full range of liturgical concerns - symbols, objects, environment, words, gestures, sprinkling, liturgical flow and timing etc.  Occasionally the author makes an error e.g. use of oils by laity; and she imposes her difficulty with masculine father-son terminology upon us all.  No such book will satisfy everyone ... but this volume comes as close as any.	2001-06-24

I enjoy Bly's translations and anthologies; therefore, I try his poetry ... this time, only to be disappointed.  And from his introduction to the early poems, I suspect he detects the same flaw as I.  He says &quot;When I composed the first of these poems, ... I hoped that a writer could describe and object or a creature without claiming it, without immersing it like a negative in his developing tank of disappointment and desire.  I no longer think that is possible&quot;.  He later mentions that the style of the object poems is usually spare - that he is unusual in accepting the human fantasy that closes many of his poems.<br />Despite the warnings, Bly's style in this poems appears inconsistent - he begins in the concrete but quickly dissolves into intellectual images i.e. images that display a highly creative, broadly educated intellect that has gone into itself rather than staying in the concrete moment that began the poem.  The result is a poem in which the poet seems centered neither in the poem nor the object of the poem but rather in his own mind.<br />There are some wonderful images, some superb turns of phrase, some excellent reinterpretations of unlikely topics (see his take on hockey) but the poems as a whole remain unsatisfying.	2001-06-24

The form of the poetry is short line, free form e.g. from &quot;Natural Criminal&quot; &quot;I am/ a nomad/ in a country/ of settlers&quot; or in Spanish &quot;soy/ un nomada/ en un pais/ de sedentarios&quot;.  Ordinarily, this form would become tiring when reading poem after poem with little variation in structure.  However, Alarcon varies content and uses the form to set &quot;gems&quot; of images.<br />While I would not expect to see these poems anthologized three centuries from now, they are immediate and evocative - well worth your time reading.	2001-06-23

For each of the prayers, it contains a page or two meditative text.  All of that is good, solid devotional text material.  However, the prayers, the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Passion&quot;, are extraordinary - a very embodied spirituality as we see in the better known Celtic material.  These texts come from the Nunnaminster Manuscipt, circa 900 AD.  These prayers are in the form of a naming of God, a remembrance of an event of the Passion, a request based upon an interpretation of the event, and a standard closing refering to Jesus Christ.<br />A list of the titles of the first few of the 24 prayers, will give you a sense of the concreteness of these prayers: On the Bending of the Knee; On the Kiss of Judas; On Restoring the Ear; On the Judgement of the Governor; On Diverse Passions; The Crown of Thorns; On the Derision of the Lord ...<br />David Scott in presenting these prayers coupled the prayer with a short verse from the Song of Songs (aka Song of Solomon).  This unusual coupling is brillant - pairing the physicality of the scripture to the physicality of the prayers.<br />Consider this a must have for the next Triduum.	2001-06-23

One strength of the collection is that it is not limited to Zen masters but includes samurai, Shinto followers, women ... The result is a collection which includes a broad range of emotional flavors - from sassy to hopeful anticipation, from expectations of heaven (pure land) to dissolution ...<br />The organizational principle (alphabetic) results in some curious juxtapositions.  The explanatory text is useful, thought-provoking and non-intrusive.  The introduction provides excellent background material on death in Japanese culture.  Everything works together to create an excellent book.	2001-06-23

By extensive use of sidebars, Fournee has kept the text simple yet provided a significant depth of knowledge.<br />The Angelus - a devotion said morning, noon and evening - consists of the Hail Mary and the words of the angel at the Annunciation.  The text explores the development of the text using art to illustrate the changing understanding of the Annunciation (Millet, Roger Van der Weynden, illuminated manuscripts ...)<br />Anyone interested in Marian devotions should read this book - its tracing of the development of the Hail Mary prayer is one of the best - as applicable to rosaries as to the Angelus.	2001-06-23

The concept - a nurturing, gentle introduction to the writing of haiku for spiritual seekers rather than poets - is an excellent concept.  The author feeds the formal and historical information required to read or write haiku in small, friendly doses.  He uses primarily examples from his students or himself rather than &quot;the masters&quot;.  He has the pleasant ability to laugh at himself and, thus, make the reader confortable with stumbling/bumbling along the way themselves.  And some of his students have written excellent haiku.<br />The problem?  the subtitle promises more than it gives &quot;writing haiku and the spiritual journey&quot; for spiritual journey is limited to the author's own Zen journey, the description of which, gives the reader little confidence in the author's qualifications.  From the poems of Sister Benedicta he includes, I'd rather read the same material as written by her.  I say that in the context of being a Westerner and a Catholic who is also both a haiku poet and a Buddhist scholar.<br />From the other reviews of this book, I observe that several individuals highly recommend this book - if their reviews entice you to read this, don't let my lack of enthusiasm disuade you.	2001-06-23

Faceing the truth takes the shape of a final, unmailed letter.  The contents including exploring whether either of the two actually loved each other, were even capable of loving another or was the relationship actually one of mutual need.  The recollections of their times together - the night, the cafes, the streets, the river - are small gems which show the relationship in its complexity.  Bronsard has a film-maker's sense of how to show the relationship rather than tell us about it.  In the same way, she shows us the insights which lead the narrator towards healing.<br />The book is scarcely more than a long short story but a very memorable one.	2001-06-23

While there is wonderful use of symbolism, the book ultimately fails on two counts.  First, there is no reason for the selection of whose lives to follow through the day.  Second, the narrator vasillated between omniscient (even knowing dreams and memories) to limited only is visible.

The tension in the narrative derives from emotional states rather than plot events - yet the tension builds as clearly as in a thriller.  This is achieved by the author's excellent understanding of her narrator's point of view and the use of landscape, daily events and memories to express that view.  Examples: the description of the landscape on the narrator's early morning walk; the destruction of letters from her mother; the memory of her roommate's dance dress but not her name ...<br />Not a perfect book but well worth the two or three hours it takes to read.	2001-06-13

Some wear their age easily e.g. &quot;Our Little Trip&quot; where a couple bound separately but with a single bandage wind/unwind while the Question Man quizzes them about relationship.  Or &quot;The Nose of Sisyphus&quot; which enacts the myth on playground equipment ... with a big baboon providing closure.  Or &quot;Sleeper&quot; - two lovers playing a single bass - one playing Baroque, the other jazz.<br />Other pieces convey important messages but are less immediate as their reference points slide into history e.g. &quot;Servants of the People&quot; with Cold War and HUAC images.  Or &quot;Fuclock&quot; set in a mantra rock dance.&quot;<br />There are two &quot;routines&quot; that had no appeal to me: &quot;Non-Objection&quot; painters in competition and &quot;The Customs Collector in Baggy Pants&quot; a explicitly sexual piece.  However, both are well written and humorous.<br />If you enjoy Ferlinghetti, are interested in the Beatniks or the Hippies, or in experimental theater, this is a fun read; it may also cause you to muse over what happenings are proper to this era.	2001-06-13

Chapter 1, for instance, is identified as :In hospital - Obituary - Odyssey of Thomas Browne's skull - Anatomy lecture - Levitation - Quincunx - Fabled creatures - Urn burial&quot;  Chapter one is relatively cohesive in topic compared to what follows.  What is remarkable in the construction of this book is that a walking tour of the east coast of England serves as a launching pad for such a wide range of topics.  As such, the book succeeds in exploring the interrelatedness of people and place and the commonality of all endeavors as the rise and fall - by effort or by seredipity.  It does so through eclectic pieces of history tied to the current foot path - showing rather than preaching.<br />An interesting book to read, reread, then wonder where it, too, might fit into its tale.	2001-06-11

The premise is that an eleven year old boy finds his adult friend dead - he hears/has heard from his friends tales of political imprisonment, of a refound first love, and of art.  Out of this he tries to sort out the &quot;why&quot; of his &quot;Friend the Artist's&quot; death.<br />This exploration is carried out with brillant images - images of the emotional content of colors, dream images of three people sharing a continuous costume, and the boy's litany of &quot;why's&quot;.

The recipes depend upon technique in rolling to create flowers, yin-yang symbols, cones, barber cones ...  There are some of these designs based upon dyed rice, ineatible leaves, or exotic serving pieces - all techniques opposed to my cooking style.  These recipes also depend upon ingredients not common in an American kitchen e.g. black beans, soy beans, red soy beans, fresh green soy beans all required for a single recipe.  The problem becomes one of obtaining the necessary ingredients in small quantities or how to use the remainder if bought in normally available quantities.<br />However, if you approach this cookbook not in terms of actual recipes but for inspiration, this is an excellent book - it allows one to move far beyond avacado rolls, cucumber rolls, Seattle rolls, California rolls i.e. the mainstays of sushi beyond the raw fish sushi.  It has wonderful photos of presentation possibilities - food as pleasing to the eye as to the palate.  It provides ideas for using Asian vegetables in small quantities; you learn if you like the taste and texture before betting a meal on it.  It's only flaw - you're left on your own for dipping sauces and other condiments - a flaw that allows one to search for pickling recipes or even chutney/salsa recipes to add some flavorful &quot;zing&quot; to the meal.	2001-06-10

They tend to use the same sentence structure (which is heavy on lists) in a way that I find obtrusive - the format overshadows content.

It also supplies one of my favorite items in translations of foreign poetry - the original text.  The strength of this book is the broad stretch of time covered, as indicated by the organization of the index: pre-T'ang dynasty, T'ang, Sun, Yuan, Ming, Ch'ing.  This breadth also means, however, that not all the poetry is of the quality one find's in more focused collections ephasizing the masters Wang Wei, Han Shan, Li Po... Several of these collections appear as &quot;selected sources&quot; in this book.<br />My favorite in this volume is The Flow and Seed Sequence, a series seven poems written by the Zen Patriarchs beginning with Bodhidharma (d. 536) with poems added to the series nearly 2 centuries later.  The translations do an excellent job of retaining the concrete imagery typical of Zen poetry e.g. from Liu Chang Ching &quot;All along the trail of moss, / I follower your wooden shoeprints&quot;. We find inventive descriptions of concret images in Liu Fang-Ping &quot;The Big Dipper slopes; / the Great Bear bends down&quot;.  There are also unusual mentions of doubt from Wang An Shih &quot;Often I doubt the Buddhist way, / that nothing truly exists&quot;.<br />Despite its many good attributes, this collection failed my ultimate test: rarely was I enticed to read and reread a poem.  I would still recommend A Drifting Boat or Cold Mountain first.  But to even be worthy of comparison to those volumes is strong praise.	2001-04-09
2044756:US	53009736	R382YVKNBJYFR4	156854085X	395345591	I Will Lie Down This Night (Prayerbooks)	Books	5	4	4	N	Y	Excellent starting point for praying the psalms	This book provides an excellent illustration of how night prayer a.k.a. compline speaks to our everyday life.  It does so in contemporary spiritual terms, e.g. several quotes are Celtic or sound Celtic, while building an understanding of a very traditional prayer.  The illustrations and the layout of the book complement the content.<br />The chapters discuss nighttime rituals and fear, the oral nature of contact in darkness, the need for companionship, facing the &quot;naked&quot; truth, sheltering, blessing, waiting in hope - each discussed in terms of the every day experiences of raising a child (or being raised).  This experience is interwoven with a parallel understanding of the words and attitudes of night prayer.<br />The final section provides materials for night prayer, a variation on the formal liturgical form.  It consists of: 1) a choice of two opening prayers 2) quiet reflection 3) a choice of two pentitential prayers 4) a choice of five psalms or canticles 5) a hymn (the one mistep on production - not making the breaks between the hymns obvious) 6) a Marian invocation 7) a choice of three closing prayers.<br />Many of the texts of the night prayer were used within the chapters introducing the concepts of night prayer.  The night prayer has been shortened, simplified and rearranged, but the various parts are very traditional.  The format for night prayer given here has distinct advantages - (1)the parts are unchanging except by personal choice giving the ready possibility of memorizing and internalizing the prayers (2) the prayer is short enough to fit easily into one schedule so it can actually be prayed rather than remaining good intentions (3) the choices fit well within the context of the book so that choices are limited to psalms/canticles which one can easily relate to one's own day.<br />Highly recommended as a viable introduction to praying the psalms.	2001-04-04

The drawings by the author's father are well chosen and well placed.  The paper and type choices all speak of a book made with respect and craft.<br />The contents of the book, identified as &quot;prose poems&quot; by the subtitle, are a diverse lot - some nearly essays, some I would title sudden fiction, and a few I would identify as prose poems. Examples of the &quot;prose poems&quot; included in this book:<br />&quot;Imposters Among the Ranks&quot; is a delightful satire on a 1990 law requiring that &quot;Indian&quot; artists prove their native heritage.<br />&quot;The Graverobbers and the Oldest Word&quot; is a perceptive 'myth' of the clash between the Old Lexicon (based in nature and the recognition of the sacred in nature) and the New Lexicon of metallic beings.  This with gentle humor exposes the emptiness of the dominate culture.<br />&quot;The Argument of the Cynic&quot; explores the issues surrounding assimilation.<br />Taken as a whole, the book explores the ethical questions arising from the history of colonial/native relationships - an exploration that recognizes the complexity and refuses to be lulled into simple answers.  Most typical of the content, but not necessarily the style, is this quote from &quot;The Argument of the Cynic&quot; - &quot;From the moment they are born, our offspring inherit the legacy of unwritten history, unprocessed grief.  In this world, there is no rest for the cynic in whose skeptical glance definitive assurance is the highest form of fiction.&quot;	2001-03-28

The illustrations for this small pamphlet capture the dark and curious flavour of the stories/poems.  These pieces could be as easily considered &quot;sudden fiction&quot; as &quot;prose poems&quot;.  The four pieces are &quot;Memory&quot; a post-human piece, &quot;Nyarlatholep&quot; an Egyptian flavored apocalyptic piece, &quot;Ex Oblivione&quot; mystic/death piece and &quot;What the Moon Brings&quot; a death piece.<br />Lovecraft's use of language is fascinating - the use of archaic and pseudo-archaic vocabulary and syntax to create a future world. The text is frequently descriptive with the adjectives piled upon adjectives for a rococo effect.  The effect, however, is often evocative e.g. &quot;I disolved again into that native infinity of crystal oblivion&quot;.<br />I recommend the book as a concise way to see what makes Lovecraft's writing work or for diehard Lovecraft fans.	2001-03-24

In reading Beautiful Signor, I initially felt that Cassels had made his first misstep - too erudite a vocabulary and sensuality without substance.  The first concern, vocabulary, was justified at points.  The second concern proved to be unjustified.  As one progresses through the book, one discovers that the sensuality has substance - it is the sensuality of love as in the Song of Solomon or of Medieval &quot;Bride of Christ&quot; poetry or of Rumi's &quot;Beloved&quot;.  Cassels does not step outside his 20th century experience nor does he claim to be a mystic - rather he writes of the sensual pleasure that points towards, gives hints of, the relationship of poet to the transcendent.<br />Having read to the end, I could then reread the earlier poems in a much different light - and for the second reading, this is vintage, excellent Cyrus Cassels.  He is a contemporary poet everyone with an interest in contemporary poetry should know.	2001-03-20

The first chapter &quot;Love Enough&quot; sets the stage for a book very different than what follows.  This story is one of guilt over the father's role in the holocaust and the looting which obtained the picture.  The story is open ended - will the art instructor accept the authenticity of the painting, will it be destroyed in an act of redemption; this open-endedness leads one to expect resolution in the subsequent chapters.<br />The structure of the book, however, is each chapter as an independent story - some connected only by the painting, two pairs that connect only to each other.  &quot;Morningshine&quot; and &quot;From the Personal Papers of Adriaan Kuypers&quot; are a pair that are an excellent piece of narrative.  The first tells of a farmer's wife disappointed with the lack of beauty in her life who wants to keep the painting rather than sell it to provide for the family - including a baby it was meant to support.  The second is the tale of the parents of the baby.  Within these chapters, the author succeeds in presenting the conflicts of life - especially well done in the case of the farmer's wife who nearly misses her husband's expressions of love for her dreams of beauty.<br />The second paired tales are &quot;Still Life&quot; and &quot;Magdalena Looking&quot;, the tale of Vameer selecting his daughter Magdalena as the subject and her encounter with the painting years later. The strength of these stories is the presentation of the mind behind the paintings - the drive for truth and what truth means in the context of art and what thwarts the drive to present truth through art.  The characterizations of the Vameer family are well done but not the defining point of these stories.<br />&quot;Hyacinth Blues&quot; is the weakest story, a story of an unsettled marriage of a French official in the Netherlands.  &quot;Adagia&quot; is an excellent story of a long term and loving marriage - of what can and cannot be said and of actions speaking what cannot be spoken.  In this story, the painting has come to be a reminder of first love.  The remaining story &quot;A Night Different From All Other Nights&quot; is a well-crafted coming-of-age story of a young Dutch Jewish girl for whom the future, even a future, is an uncertainity.<br />Throughout the work, the description of the picture by the various characters provides insight to the picture itself, to the character contemplating it, and to the relationship of art to the viewer.  This later item is truly to art in general not specifically to visual art.<br />While the construction of the book is flawed, the first story raising expectations inappropriate to what follows, many of the stories are excellent and the exploration of the art-viewer relationship is superb ... hence four stars.marriage - of what can and cannot be said and of actions speaking what cannot be spoken.

In content not size	Jabes is rarely easy to read - his demands on the reader are too high.  In this slim volume, this is even more true for, if one has not read other works by Jabes, it would be difficult to place his primary vocabulary - page, book, Nothingness, etc. - in the intended context.<br />If you are familiar with his work, however, you will find all the usual reasons for loving the book.  An example of an unforgettable image: &quot;Serpent may be a word so drawn out that it cannot help crawling along its own shadow&quot;.<br />His look at death and freedom is etched in thought provoking images of frail birds that provokes a deep melancholy, an emotional thread much stronger than in his other works.<br />There is a mention of Auschwitz as a formative moment for those living in the second half of the twentieth century, but the Holocaust does not inform the whole work as it does in the Book of Questions.  Rather, these aphorisms reflect on the inevitable, individual death in the face of the only truth known to us - Unknowability.<br />An absolutely brilliant book that marketed as his &quot;last substantial work&quot; reminds one how great a writer was lost in his death.	2001-03-04

This book is intended for the cook who will actually plant the salad garden - it begins with a chapter on gardens with marvelous photographs of salad garden - formal and informal - with concrete design and care information.<br />The strength of this book, however, is in its description of salad ingredients which it divides into salad leaves, salad vegetables, herbs and edible flowers.  Each group is subdivided: salad leaves, for example, is divided into lettuce leaves (three groups), chicory, endives, rocket, dandelion, corn salad, purslane, spinach, sorrel, good King Henry, cresses and brassicas.  Other groups are as broadly covered, descriptions including advice on the appropriate uses.<br />The salad recipes themselves are not particularly inventive.  However, they are practical and little touches make them visually spectacular i.e. good &quot;company&quot; or &quot;special&quot; meal salads.  For example, a typical fresh mozzarella and tomato salad is paired with pesto and a few mixed leaves and a bit of bread for an elegant first course (or full meal in my house).  There is an interesting green lentil dressing, a cucmber mousse, a dandelion and sorrel salad with bacon, potatoes, and croutons.<br />In short, this book provides a basis for exploring a variety of salad ingredients until you are comfortable mixing nearly everything your green grocer supplies.	2001-02-28

These section provide a very cursory overview - glitter but little substance.<br />The salad recipes cover a wide variety of salads; chapters on: vegetable and green salads, bean and pulse salads, cheese salads, egg salads, fish and seafood salads, pasta and rice salads, grain salads, meat and poutry salads, waldorf salads and fruit salads.  What sets this book apart and makes it a useful addition to any collection is its use of fruits e.g. an avacado and grapefruit salad, a Thai Tom Tom salad with papaya, a fennel and orange salad etc.  It's second strength is in the use of Asian ingredients e.g. a Thai water chestnut salad, a Chinese pork salad, or a persimmon salad.<br />The recipes are practical - neither time intensive nor requiring ingredients difficult to obtain.  Certainly not the first salad book to own, but one worth including.	2001-02-28

The ingredients are internationally inspired and, as such, offer some new ideas: an eggplant, olive and tahini salad; a middle eastern pilaf salad.  It uses cheeses in interesting ways - a warm camembert salad, a layered cheese and ham salad.

Chulkaturin is alone - only an old woman caring for him - facing death without family or friends.  He begins writing a diary, an accounting of his life. What begins as a biography beginning with his childhood, becomes the narration of a single event, an event he believes illustrates beyond all doubt that he is a &quot;superfluous man&quot;.  This event is a one-sided love for a girl just becoming a woman.  In this story Turgenev presents us with alienation - 1850's Russian style.  For those of us raised on existential alienation, this book is an excellent reminder that alienation is a far more universal literary theme - a theme well executed in this book.	2001-02-26

It is difficult to fairly rate Kappa because, while it is excellent and entertaining, it is not equal to the exquisite Rashomon collection.  Neither is the book the equivalent of Gulliver's Travels although there is a distinct similarity.  Rather Kappa is the story of a human in the world of mythical water creatures, Kappa.  The narrator is an unnamed patient in a mental hospital; thus the framework of the story is one of a narrator whose reliability is open to question.  Within this framework, Akutagawa manages to build a credible world satirizing Japanese culture. He skewers art, politics, marriage, philosophers - all with a light but wicked wit that keeps you laughing and cringing in recognition.	2001-02-26

From that experience, he gives us a mixture of monastic history, of lives of selected (composite) monks discerning their calling and growth, and a picture of the issues confronting the religious community as they grapple with the issues raised by Vatican II.<br />The resulting book stresses several points:<br />Monk are human with the same foibles as the non-vowed Catholic population.<br />That a major component of what sets monks apart is the stability of their lives and the community in which those lives are lived; this results in an environment where confronting oneself and one's masks is inevitable.<br />That balance of work, play and prayer is essential to fostering wholeness.<br />That the monk's life is nearly a universal human activity and that much of what formerly distinguished the professed religious life is now adopted/adapted by dedicated laity.<br />That God truly works in mysterious ways - exemplified by the author's changed understanding of God as he finally confronts his son's death.<br />The genius of the book is that it achieves the list given above primarily through the narrative of human experience within the monastic community.  Where more abstract theology/history is provided, it is generally within the context of conversation with individual monks presenting their individual experience and belief.<br />With the narrative, there are individuals that the reader comes to care about - the crusty, rigid Br. Bede, the Texas ranch boy Mac, the novice Gabriel ...  Through these and many others, the reader catches glimpses of themselves and their own needs.  In this sense, the lives of the monks as presented, serve as a mirror nudging the reader to examine themselves as the monks are examining themselves.	2001-02-08

There is nothing innately &quot;Catholic&quot; about these ceremonies, they merely assume the existence of a personal God.<br />The format of each blessing is :<br />1) a symbol - potted plant, sweater, spices i.e. things normally found around the house<br />2) a gathering prayer which sets the context for the blessing<br />3) a three part prayer with a petition, the lighting of one candle, silence, a second petition, the lighting of a second candle, silence, a third petition with a pause<br />4) a very short reading - scriptural, Jewish teaching tales, quotes from movies, Islamic poets, Gaelic blessings, Hindu scripture, authors of whom I've never heard  ... These readings are well chosen so that the blessing can be a family event.<br />5) Two questions for reflection<br />6) a short responsory - very brief petitions and a fixed response - both oriented to the topic of blessing<br />7) a sending prayer i.e. a short prayer of dismissal or &quot;ungathering&quot;<br />8) an action meaningful in context of the symbol - sprinkling water on the grave of a pet, singing Happy Birthday after blessing a birthday cake etc.<br />The genius of these blessings are the ability to have something meanful to all ages.  These are truly family ritual blessing not merely something the adults do while the children figit.<br />The blessing are divided into every day, special needs, special occasions and for the year.  Examples: for home, for work, for friendship, for career decisions, when disappointed, for death of a pet, for mending quarrels, for a birthday, for a graduation, for a promotion, before a journey, for Advent, for Epiphany, for Father's day, for Halloween ...<br />I rarely like newly-invented rituals but this book is a real keeper.

The books is rather another of the &quot;sisters meet Vatican II' style written from the point of few of a Catholic-educated, nonpracticing Catholic.<br />The focus of the book is on what it means to be called; initially the author works from the premise that &quot;called&quot; means primarily called to religious life.  At the conclusion, her primary insight is that ones &quot;call&quot; may be to a particular aspect of secular life.<br />She traces her slowing change view of nuns and call primarily through sisters she knew as a child or young adult - most of whom left the order.  By not including some of those who joined the order after the substantial changes (for example, one who serves as a hospital chaplain), she fails to explore what a &quot;call to religious life&quot; means today.  This results in an understanding of call that is primarily individualistic in a church that is fundamentally communal.  The author is also sloppy in her Catholic terminology, sloppy in a way that reveals that her research assumed as a base the Church from which she was estranged rather than the Church of today.  An example: she refers to the nun serving the King County Jail as &quot;saying Mass&quot; a role reserved for ordained priests rather than the more accurate &quot;presiding at a Eucharistic service&quot;.<br />What the book truly is a memoir-exploration of a non-practicing Catholic sifting through her childhood with adult eyes, using the nuns who taught her in school as a catalyst for this exploration.  In this exploration, we learn the stories of several young nuns who entered and left the order.  We learn the stories of some who stayed, who redefined what it meant to be a nun (Dominican sister to be more precise).  Those who stayed are presented rightly as remarkable people facing the world squarely in the face - assisting in jail, in urban social services, in hospitals, in rural Hispanic populations ...<br />The writing is such that you get a sense of who each person is in a very short section which leaves you wanting more or leaves you chuckling about the description if you know the individual described in person or through books.  For example, she briefly mentions Fr. Joseph as becoming charimatic - Fr. Joseph has written and self published a delightful biography.<br />I recommend the book as a delight insight into a particular side of Catholic childhood and female religious orders.

Benet was raised Catholic in a mixed Lutheran-Catholic marriage.  As for Jon Hassler's comparison to The Seven Story Mountain, I find the relationship weak at best - as if he and I read different books for one or the other.  I point these items out because false expectations can easily make one fail to enjoy the book for what it is.<br />It is not a conversion story.  It is not even a particularly spiritual story.  It is gentle musings by an older brother of the Blue Cloud monastery on his experiences in the monastery - musing of the same nature as casual conversation as two people get to know each other.  For its gentle musings, the book is one of several good books on monastic life.  Personally, I prefer A Monastic Year : Reflections from a Monastery.<br />It is also an astute study of how monastic communities adapt the Rule of St. Benedict to contemporary life and to individual situtations within the monastic culture. Here the book is the best I know - anyone reading the Rule must also read this book.<br />Finally, the book provides the context within which Roberta Bondi and Kathleen Norris (both Protestant) write.  For those unfamilar with the monastic culture, this is an excellent way to gain a realistic (not idealistic) view of the life style they have come to value.  For this, too, I highly recommend the book.<br />As for the book itself, it is filled with delightful characters - saintly and not-so-saintly.  There is the German monk for whom nothing American will ever measure up.  There is the monk who appoints himself library censor, the infirmary nurse into folk remedies, the missionary to the Dakotas forced to take a &quot;sabbatical&quot;, the mischevious dog, the &quot;falling&quot; priest, the gentle scholar, the novitiate who left and when dying of AIDS has the community come to his support.  All of them described in brief chapters that are a pleasure to read - clear, unobtrustive prose that values the message above the word.  If nothing else, after reading this delightful book, everyone should be able to say &quot;I, too, can be religious ... &lt;name&gt; is as flawed as I&quot;.above the word.

Each new volume shows a more confident and nuanced voice.  While this volume continues his emphasis on his Fresno Chicano background with its hard, down to earth, poor Hispanic Catholic background, this volume occasionally shows his educated, academic side.  But how creatively: &quot;Blind Tiresa, pagan god of no importance/ ... / You were booted out of town by Christians, / Their bottoms gnawed by lions and such.&quot;  Absolutely splendid images and language.<br />I won't claim that his concrete poetry will be highly values in 1000 years ... but he should he considered a major poet of the century if the basis is the quality of his work.

While staying within his own concrete experience, he allows himself to identify completely with the experience of others e.g. Lorca.  He does so with marvelously surprising yet precise language e.g. of asthma &quot;exhausted in the slow foraging for breath&quot;.<br />The second section is turn of the century France, expressed in lyrics meant to accompany music of Eric Satie.  If, in the first section, the reader notes the language, here, the reader notes the form ... Gymnopedies coming surprising close to replicating in language the form of the music yet remaining poetry for the sake of word and meaning not sound.<br />The last section turns to Japan.  While this section includes the weakest poem of the collection, this section as a whole shows a gentle wisdom regarding humanity that is rare to find in a poet so earlier in his career.  He exhibits a comprehension of the Zen view &quot;This is the stillness / at the core of breath. / As the cranes lift, I feel no moment -&quot;.  But this understanding appears to come, not out of Zen practice, but of understanding of human experience as a whole.<br />I was drawn to this volume through my enjoyment of Soul Make A Path Through Shouting ...

It does an excellent job of showing the competing images - the Anglo-Saxon view of &quot;warrior-king&quot;, the Celtic &quot;hermit-ascete&quot; and the Roman &quot;wealthy bishop&quot; - and how these images interplayed within the church and in secular government.<br />The book is structured as a series of short entries on individuals, events or places rather than into a sustained narrative.  This works well given the changing geographic boundaries and the vagarities of the political times.  However, it left me wanting a genealogy for references as brothers, sisters, cousins, and entourages reappear in unexpected places.<br />This book contains only a few of the hagiographic miracle stories, but enough are provided to give a sense of the common beliefs of the time.<br />This book provides sufficient historical background to understand the development of the Catholic Church in England; enough for a non-historian, only a brief overview for the true historian.	2001-01-16

If these stories are representative, his range of style was impressive - some pieces are quite satires on the Communist regime, others are humorous looks at human nature, others absurdist in a mode that reminds me most of Barry Yourgrau.  A few of the tales fail, several are gems, the rest fill out the continuum.<br />In one tale, the sand in an egg-timer &quot;hour&quot; glass bemoans his career choice as he has developed a tendency to clump.<br />In another tale, a simple request from his sick wife to pick up bread and cold cuts becomes a shopping frenzy.<br />In another a woman is resurrected and after brief conversations with the witnesses, walks back into her grave.<br />Or a man, reheating potatoe puree, mistakes his neighbor's fight for a TV show.<br />People are not who they seem to be - a &quot;tramp&quot; is an Olympic star, a noted professor ... Einstein, Lenin, Eva Braum all make appearances.  Through the mayhem, one gets a taste of life in Budapest, the strengths (and weaknesses) of the Hungarian people, and of a style of writing that was permitted to note the foibles in a period where, at least as an American, I thought writing to be more strictly censored.	2001-01-08

The title story, my personal favorite, has a narrator obsessed with the details of dressing.  He tells the story of his father's death, a father whose job it was to create fictious entries for reference works.  In this context the author raises serious issues regarding the nature of fact, fiction and truth.<br />Present Tense has a narrator volunteering for a test in circadian medicine where the narrator is obsessed with creating personal measurements of time when external clues are erased.<br />Dead Lines moves from a simple survey of employment of disabled people, to testing of telephone lines to the absurd and dangerous.<br />Vacancy for a Photo-finisher plays off the details of perspective.<br />Space Invaders considers human interaction from the perspective of our &quot;private space&quot; being defined by bubbles in which we exist.<br />The final piece retells the tale of the Mutiny on the Bounty in the context of space travel.<br />The stories not mentioned are equally diverse and creative.  Through the stories, a keen sense of human foibles is expressed in creative prose - often with a very loose plot.  In these stories the author succeeds if you as reader set aside strict narrative expectations and let the author define his rules of the game of creative narrative.	2001-01-07

This observation, although in a piece of fiction, is substantiated by the sense of plot in these stories.  While the grammar and syntax of the stories is literary, the plot is that of sharing over a cup of coffee.  Within this context, the stories are excellent.<br />Transactions tells of a salesman who wants children while his wife does not.  He buys a small child he found in the roadway.  His ruminations on how to get his wife to accept the child and his care for the child's need explore marital expections and prejudices based on gradations of skin color.<br />Monster tells of the narrator's relationship with her father and grandmother (his mother-in-law) in the context of movies, especially in the showing of Frankenstein in grandmother's house.<br />Rubicon is the story of regulars at a bar, especially a young girl waiting while her mother carries on an affiar.<br />A Public Woman is a reflection on the death of a prostitute in the &quot;Wild West&quot;.<br />The stories geographical cover a wide area - Jamaica, France, New York, California.  In each case, it is the gap between the community ideal of perfection vs. reality that propells the story forward.  In Art History, the instability of the boss with regards to her son; in Wartime, the gap between hero and drunk combining with the new - a military surgeon with dark skin ...<br />There are a few times when the author expects detailed knowledge of her time period that the reader may not share.  Outside this minor flaw, the stories succeed in showing the clash between cultures - economic elitism, racism, diverse interpretations of similar events, etc.	2001-01-07

A sampling of the texts included:<br />&quot;Dino&quot; is the story of an invisible dog accompanying its master on long walks in Portugal.  The dog reappears in &quot;At the Forest's Edge&quot; - a story of a nearly deserted hotel with no cook and a sexually agressive daughter.<br />&quot;In Passing&quot;, a personal favorite among these texts, tells the story of a couple, a beggar and a passerby twice - changing the gender of the roles between the two tellings.<br />&quot;The Cafe de La France&quot; is a bleak view of Le Havre as decimated by the war - a very effective piece mulling over writing and childhood in the context of the ruined city.<br />&quot;The Trojan Horse&quot; occurs in a bar where a horse from Troyes insists on purchasing drinks for a couple drinking only water and planning to &quot;hit up&quot; an aunt for financial assistance.<br />&quot;Green With Fright&quot; combines wordplay and dream in the story of a man unable to leave the bathroom because of his fear of the nothingness lurking in the hallway.<br />&quot;Conversations in Greater Paris&quot; is &quot;found poetry&quot; i.e. an assemblage of bits and pieces of conversations captured in the author's notebooks.<br />&quot;Texticles&quot; is a collection of short pieces based in some sense on word play, rhetoric, semantics - they are an excellent example of playing with words as a media rather than as a tool of communication.<br />&quot;A Story of Your Own&quot; is an early example of a tree-structure story in which after each piece of the tale, you are offered options as to what should come next.<br />&quot;Some Brief Remarks Relative to the Aerodynamic Properties of Addition&quot; is a piece that considers the movement of numbers and arithemetic symbols due to the force of the wind ... an absolute delight.<br />&quot;Dream Accounts Aplenty&quot; is a series of short dream accounts told as an example of the shortcomings of dreams as the &quot;stuff&quot; of writing.<br />The other pieces are as diverse as the ones I have mentioned.

One sentence on the first page caught my attention - the remainder of the book continued to hold my attention with the same mastery of depicting the complexity of people in simple terms.  The sentence? &quot;He could plow and sow, milk cows, cook potato pancakes, find wild boletus mushrooms even out of season, ferry people in his boat during high waters, weave baskets, hunt deer, rescue travelers and half-frozen animals, silence the stupid, and he knew how to laugh.&quot; - that is the description of Uncle Prosek who, to the young narrator, knew how to do everything.<br />It is Uncle Prosek who taught the narrator to fish, who helped the narrator's Jewish father poach a deer ... The independent chapters which make up this novel tell of the family adventures before the war - father becoming the world's best Electrolux salesman for the love of the wife of his boos, falling for a scam on purchasing a carp pond and years later giving the scam artist appropriate revenge.  During the war, the two older sons and the father are sent to concentration camps; they survive but grandmother does not.  Here the novels tells of the narrator's escapades fishing to survive - encountering mill owners who cheat him and fish wardens who act kindly to him.  And finally the book follows his father into life after the war.<br />Throughout the book, the ability of the author to depict people - an attribute the narrator ascribes both to the narrator's father and to a famous painter known to the father - makes this &quot;simple&quot; memoir into a memorable study of human behavior.  This is human behavior of the roguish, flawed but fundamentally kind nature.<br />Fishermen may enjoy this book but the book is of human nature, portrayed in conjunction with fishing, not a book of fishing.  Well worth the short time it takes to read this book.	2000-12-19

Having started life as the son of a feral cat, his opinions of the world, appropriate cat behavior, sufficient caution etc. are more bleak than those of some fictional cats.  Read a few pages and you'll be hooked on his story.<br />Unfortunately, the book doesn't live up to its start.  The author fails to keep the Foudini's view consistent ... here, he seems to understand human language, there he clueless of human meaning ... here, he understands natural cat life and wishes to be free, there he hasn't a clue regarding a female cat in heat.<br />The net result is a pleasant afternoon's read; nothing more.	2000-12-17

Riveting because of the quality of the imagination; frustrating because reading is one long riddle requiring very intense concentration by the reader.<br />The book is filled with wordplay ... most notably beginning with a gypsy &quot;game&quot; of describing the scene on a ball filled with boiling water ...; the narrator wins the game in what is called &quot;a new triumph ... of analytical poetry over descriptive prose&quot;.  Songs seem to carry hidden messages.  Horse pedigrees are given in exhaustive detail.  A man writes and speaks backwards - two languages, in effect, for one reverses sounds, the other letter.  Old manuscripts hide clues in the red letters at the beginning of each line - if you only know what to add and where to divide.  Authors and titles of books seized at customs, nine civil servants each of whom distorts language more strongly than the predecessor.<br />Through all the word play is a plot that is entertaining - but not always sufficiently so to motivate one to put the work into reading that this novel demands.<br />In short, The Conversions has a fascinating use of language in a satisfactory plot; the author is in full control at all times.  Well worth your time ... but chose your time well.	2000-12-10
2189355:US	53009736	R3T1LJLUW5WMUA	0936784032	891199186	Brief Cherishing: A Napa Valley Harvest	Books	2	0	5	N	N	a &quot;memoir&quot; of retirement in the Napa Valley	Unlike the previous reviewer (msem), I am unimpressed with this book.  Unlike many of the older women writing their lives in some sense, Flanner has neither the wisdom nor the sense of humor at her own foibles that make such writing interesting to me.<br />The second piece, Jacinto, is a humorous escapade of Flanner and a billy goat.  There is some delightful self-deprecation: &quot;In this case guardian means goatherd and that was beyond my capability. 'Counselor to a smart goat,' that gave me a better position&quot;.  But while the story is humorous, the message that shines through the prose is one of tiredness and frustration not humor and learning.  I also questioned the classical references &quot;or waiting with Philotues for Odysseus to return&quot; as the author no where ties such references into the building of character, plot or atmosphere.<br />The first piece, Miguel, provides a wonderful sketch of the gardener but I was uncomfortable with the author's willingness to paint large groups of people with very broad swipes.  My objection is not the lack of current political correctness but rather the lack of providing a story of universality depicted in the particular.  There results some wonderful abuse of facts - &quot;they (Mexicans) were often owners, especially the Guatemalans, of quite beautiful hats.&quot;  When did Guatemala become a part of Mexico?<br />Unless you have an active interest in the history of the Napa Valley or are a fan of Hildegarde Flanner, pass on this book. I will, however, grant that the book has some excellent poetic writing and provides insight into the mind set of Flanner's generation.	2000-12-03

However, once the story developed its own momentum, the language became natural, pleasant to read.<br />The book is an excellent story of coming of age in a changing culture - the elders seemingly fail to understand the youth that has some education.  These youth are caught in the middle; they don't want to farm in the traditional way yet they lack sufficient education for it to provide employment.  They are in the middle in another sense - they are the children of the civil war.  This leads to their coming of age event to be a wrestling match rather than a dance.  Quietly and wisely in the background, several village elders orchestrate the events to teach the youth a lesson - in war everyone loses.<br />While this novel is unlikely to become a world classic, it is well worth reading.	2000-11-29

In contrast, this book can be read multiple times - each time new nuances will catch one's attention.<br />The story line is deceptively simple - a young historian is hired by an elderly woman to finish her husband's memoires.  He immediately becomes infatuated with her niece - the only other person seen in the household although mention is made of an unseen servant.  He comes to see himself as the one to rescue the niece from thralldom only to discover that age and relationship are not as they seem.<br />Within this plot, Fuentes explores human freedom, its absence, its abuse - all in a fascinating tale.	2000-11-22

They are of uncertain origin and authenticity; however, the strength of the contents makes their authenticity academic.  In five letters, we see the psychological movement from blind, passionate love to an awareness of having been used - while still valuing the lessons of what passion is possible in the heart.  We see this movement through the letters of a young Portuguese nun who was seduced by a French military officer serving in Portugal.  While this is a work of the 17th century, the insight into human nature could well have been written yesterday - the culture and the date are no barrier to the text.	2000-11-22

The afterward includes a useful biography of the author and a short analysis of the story; my bias is always to allow the story to stand on its own and print literary criticism in books of literary criticism - Elaine Hedges bears the brunt of my bias by simply pointing out the obvious with regards to the wall-paper as symbol.<br />The story itself is very interesting - it is difficult to remember you are reading fiction rather than an excerpt from a diary - the author is superb at writing in a style that seems to be uncensored thoughts.  Within this framework, Gilman manages to have the narrator's changing perceptions of the wall-paper pattern reflect the narrator's descent into insanity.  There is a didactic content built into the actions and words of the characters other than the narrator - the very rational husband-doctor, the sister-in-law who efficiently keeps the house going as its &quot;mistress&quot; deteriorates.<br />A slim volume, this story gives excellent insight into the culture and individuals who spurred the &quot;first&quot; women's movement.	2000-11-21

The stories in flash fiction read as though their diminutive size came naturally; these are stories that were printed without regard to their size but have been reprinted because of their size.  Unfortunately, many of the stories would be more satisfying within a mix of story sizes ... the stories are simply shorter than one's mind switches between stories.  The anthology is a standard mix of stories that have strong appeal, are technically fine but &quot;don't speak to me&quot;, and those you wonder why they were printed.  Personal favorites:<br />The Corporal by Carolyn Forche, I first read as a prose poem.  This story speaks strongly to the mentality behind repressive governments - a theme strong in much of Forche's work.<br />Girl by Jamaica Kincaid is a story that shows the creativity of Kincaid (best illustrated by At the Bottom of the River) that speaks in an unusual way to the relationship between a girl and her mother ... and her mother's expectations.<br />Bread by Margaret Atwood may not exactly be a narrative but again it is a strong piece regarding social justice in a variety of forms.<br />Subtotals by Gregory Burnham is an interesting evaluation of life by enumeration - a clever idea well executed that left me less than satisfied.<br />The Haircut by Mary Morris is a story in which non-verbal communication in an intimate relationship is well used; still I found the story only interesting.<br />Spencer Holst's Brilliant Silence is a brilliant story of dancing bears deserted by their owner but still dancing.<br />Richard Shelton's The Stones is another brilliant story built on a premise of stones having life of a sort.<br />Adrienne Clasky's From the Floodlands explores a setting so wet that one can drown in the air, that the sky and the sea merge as the horozin fails to delinate the line between them.<br />Other tales may catch your attention; there is sufficient variety that nearly everyone should fine some stories to their liking.	2000-11-15

Millhauser.  That these stories intrigue the reader, engage in the reader in serious thought, etc. is a tribute to the mastery of the author.<br />News from Nepal provides a satirical view of the work place combined with one view of what constitutes death.<br />Hermit and Six-Toes provides insight into mystical philosophers - philosophers who happen to be chickens on a chicken ranch.<br />Crystal World combines military guard duty with chemical highs during the political instability of 1917.<br />Nika, with a surprise ending that ensures that the story be read at at least three levels, deals with direct acceptance of the world (in contrast to the intellectual approach) and death.<br />Mid-Game revolves around conformity in the former Communist power structure and actual identity - in the context of street-walkers, sailors and chess.<br />The Life and Adventures of Shed Number XII is the life of a shed who finds true self-expression in life as a bicycle.  Pelevin is so good that even this artistic conceit works.<br />The Blue Lantern considers the nature of life and death in the context of boys in a dorm telling scary stories, stories with truly disturbing philosophical implications.<br />The Tambourine of the Upper World mixes the traditional wisdom of an old woman with a successful scheme to make money in the new Russian economy.<br />If you've not yet read Pelevin, it is time to start - and this is a good place to do so.	2000-11-12

Her writings have moved from poetry to poetry and prose poems to this book subtitled poems and tales - some of the tales are more essay than tale.  Looking specifically at the essays, I realized why I was less satisfied with this book:  her work is more personal, more self revealing in a way which makes it less universal.  But one of the real strengths in much of her writting is that she writes of the particular - her Native American cultural background - in a way that makes it ring as true experience, as universal truth.<br />Once I recognized this shift and read A Map to the Next World with a mind set closer to how I would read confessional poetry, I began to appreciate some of the pieces I first considered weaker in a more favorable light - for example, the design of light and dark - an essay on snap judgment based on hue of skin.  The piece Returning from the Enemy is a very strong autobiographical piece alternating prose and poetry - the former being individual and personal, the latter being more universal.  The alternation of the two build upon each other as fact and truth ... an thus built a splendid foundation for understanding both the truth of Joy Harjo's life as well as truth of all our lives.<br />Her poetry has strong and wonderful images - from Songs from the House of Death, Or How to Make It Through to the End of a Relationship comes &quot;I run my tongue over the skeleton / jutting from my jaw. I taste / the grit of heartbreak&quot;.<br />As usual, Joy Harjo is a master worth reading; this book simply requires a slight adjustment in effort of understanding.	2000-11-02

Trip Trap leaves me unimpressed.<br />However, the book contains a recollection of the trip by Albert Saijo, the trip as described in an unfinished work of Lew Welch, Trip Trap itself which is a collaborative effort between those two and Jack Kerouac, and finally some letters of Lew Welch to Jack Kerouac.  The net result is a book that gives insight into the beat movement and into the minds of Kerouac and Welch.  For those with even a slight interest in either topic, this is an interesting and informative book.	2000-11-02

In this genre, if the story is truly to be a narrative, there is no room for wasted words or mistakes.  The previous volume was about one third stories that seemed to fit the form rather than being squeezed into the form.  In this anthology fully three-fourths seem natural.<br />One type of story that works very well are those that are based on familiar stories - Hamlet, Adam and Eve, nursery rhymes; these have an extended background that serves as an assumed part of the story.  Some would be gimicks in lesser hands - the story presented as a recipe, another Adam and Eve play.  Several are wonderful plays on expectations - Temptation by Eric Sandberg and Chris Hansen where truth is truer than expected or The Masterpiece by Karen Robles where the arsonist's love of fire is carried to its logical conclusion.<br />The form still is a bit of a gimick when one story after another meets the 55 word limit, but many of these stories would be recognized as solid stories if intermingled with stories of other sizes.	2000-11-02

I have never been disappointed.  Unlike her later books that contain a number of prose poems, this book contains only free form poems.  However, the poems are often highly rhythmic in a musical sense - I was not suprised to find that she is an accomplished jazz saxophone player.  Her images are creative and clear - brilliant word gems which are scattered in the poems: &quot;horses neighing / at the razor sky&quot;<br />The poetry is starkly truthful - universal human lives using alcohol to escape their pain, seeking love ...  But this universality is expressed primarily from her Cree culture, expressed in a way that allows us to see another world view, to see her experience within that world view.<br />An example: &quot;She feels the sky / tethered to the changing / earth, and her skin / responds, like a woman / to her lover.&quot;<br />Beautiful contemporary poetry not to be missed.	2000-10-30

This book contains a number of prose poems as well as modern verse; it is clear that Harjo writes what is true and allows it to take the form in which it presents itself.<br />This collection includes poems that explore human relationships, music, death ... universal concerns written about in a way that recognizes and uses the universality while selecting the images from her Cree background.  We are privileged to glimpse another way of relating to the world while being presented with the difficulties of growing up in a minority culture.  &quot;At five I was designated to string beads in kindergarten.  At seven I skew how to play chicken and win.  And at fourteen I was drinking.&quot;<br />But her command of the language amkes even the starkest reality beautiful: &quot;I am fragile, a piece of pottery smoked from fire / made of dung, /the design drawn from nightmares.  I am an arrow, painted / with lighning ...<br />Harjo is one of the best contemporary poets.  Try any of her books and you'll see a poet, a musician, a painter all sharing their vision with you.	2000-10-30

This volume contains several of the more political pieces on her album (with Poetic Justice) - the boarding schools, the unkept promises, the discrimination.  Several of the piece blur the line between poetry and prose but read aloud a clearly poetry.<br />To read this poetry is to receive a gift, a grace of seeing another way to view the world - one in which the tree, the butterfly, the water speak and are connected to oneself.  She clearly speaks from experience, from truth - not as some who tell such stories of connected for personal gain but as one to whom this telling describes her world.  But in connectedness she shows the tears - the alcohol, 'Nam, enforced 'white culture' - the rips in the Native cultures that must be healed for the people to survive.<br />Excellent poetry - deep in meaning, superb in handling of language and image.	2000-10-30

The joy of the book is in the details - the seeming heaviness of shoes after years of prison canvas shoes, the steaming miso after years of soup cooled before it reached your cell.  Through these details the author provides a psychological novel exploring guilt, redemption, freedom, restriction, social ties ....<br />This book is well worth reading, well worth a thoughtful reading.	2000-10-29

This was my introduction to Mahfouz; I understand why he is a Nobel Prize winner.  The books uses a number of short vignettes to describe the neighbor over the lifetime of the narrator.  Through these vignettes one sees the changing world of the neighbor - from governed by a thug-king to something resembling faith in Egytian government passing through the overthrow of the British rule.  The changing world is also reflected in schooling, in women working, in the partial overthrow of superstition, etc.  Each vignette is so perfect and the total effect of them makes this a book you should not miss.	2000-10-27

The author takes exception with including visual art as &quot;liturgical environment&quot; arguing that the visual language should be part of the liturgy.<br />An example of the direction his thoughts take us: the events in the life of Christ are appropriate for depictions on the church walls as they are integral to the liturgy; the stations of the cross are appropriate only in the season of Lent.  This brings us back to the eastern rite iconastasis for the narrative material of the art, although he does not specifically make this connection.<br />A second example: he makes an interesting distinction between three dimensional depictions of saints which leave them in this world and hence are devotional vs. icons which depict them glorified and hence can be liturgical.<br />This is a thought provoking and practical book that should be read before any building or renovation of a church.	2000-10-27

At the point that the focus changes to that of the second son, the reader may, for a short while, wonder if Okuizumi has drifted from the otherwise tight structure; rest assured that he has not.<br />The first section of the book narrates the events of World War II that plague Manase - time in a cave with sick and dying comrades who dreamed of one last chance to die in battle while killing the dying to decrease the need for food an water.  One of the dying spoke to Manase of rocks - rocks containing the history of the world.<br />The second section narrates Manase's obsession with rocks, his emotional distance from his family, his outward success and inward failure - all under the cloud of nightmares of the cave.  When tragedy comes, the surface normality of his family life collapses.<br />The final section narrates the story second son, the son raised by his aunt.  The son's fate becomes the vehicle through which Manase is forced to remember that part of the history of the cave that was sublimated.  As part of that remembrance, he is forced to reevaluate the destruction of his family.<br />That the author tells the story in such quiet and compact a manner adds to the impact of the book.  Add this to your must read list.	2000-10-27

Especially revealing is the merchant's changed perceptions of the painting in his Dutch home and in the Danish manor where he expects to sell it.<br />The fourth story considers the nature of fidelity - explored in the context of Charles V and his steward.  This story has remarkable use of a gypsy woman and a cat to further the story; they are examples of how tightly the stories are written.  They seem to be liesurely reads but every element and word is used.<br />The final story is the response of a wife with a very strong sense of propriety and place to her husband's sudden paralysis; here the awkwardness of the children and the diligence of the servant assigned to the invalid's care are especially notable.  I initially was disturbed by the author's reading the mind of the invalid, but by the end of the story I appreciated the need for her technique.<br />This is a stunning book that you truly should read.	2000-10-26

Nonetheless, the book is a delightful romp in the history of the camera obscura, in the rereading of history, in the vision of an unstable mind breaking.  While the plot is a very concise with only three characters - the owner of the camera, an Italian model, an art student - the story engages the Chinese inventors of the camera obscura, deVinci and Vemeer.  It is this play with the history of the camera obscura that makes this an interesting, though flawed, first novel.  It will be worth watching for additional novels, Knowles' talent is worth watching develop.	2000-10-25

Henry, Edgar Lee Masters and Edna St. Vincent Millay.  Therefore, I reread Renascence as part of a reading stroll down memory lane - and found again the elegence that impressed us many years ago.<br />Many of these poems deal with grief and death including suicide.  But beginning with the near-mystical Renascence there is a confidence in something more.  Her skill is best shown in the sonnets, a form she used extensively as it is a near perfect fit for her sensibilities.<br />She is very much a traditional in form and rhyme with much of her imagery being garden and flower.  However, there are few times that the syntax becomes awkward or forced in order for her thoughts to fit the form.  In short, this is a poetry book worth reading.	2000-10-24

It is important to remember that these are version by Stephen Berg not careful translations from the original - as reworkings often are the most accessible translations.<br />Ikkyu was not a typical Zen master - the monkish disciplines of celebacy and sobriety were not in his repetoire.  While this makes him an oddity, it reinforces the ideal that one who is enlightened is one who is free.  This freedom (often seen as indifference or non-clinging) is voiced in this poem &quot;Ikkyu this body isn't yours I say to myself / wherever I am I'm there&quot;.  His freedom from the disciplines is shown in poems that are explicitly sexual not merely erotic.  A very tame example: &quot;don't hesitate get laid thaat's wisdom / sitting around chanting what crap&quot;.<br />Ikkyu is definately a poet that students or would-be students of Zen should read ... in fact, we all should read it for the sheer fun and beauty of it.	2000-10-24

They are well chosen to grace the poetic prose elegy by Patti Smith. The prose reminds me in a strange way of the writings of H.D. - the story of facing death is told in mythic terms - in terms of the sea, the search for the Hercules moth, the sighting of the Southern Cross as his uncle had promised, of Greek gods.  Its strength is in the description of Mapplethrope as artist - fascinated by arranging, estranged from nature. The writing is not without flaws but it is interesting and telling.	2000-10-23

Tristessa is a Mexico City junkie whom Kerouac loves; a junkie he sees in the Buddhist light &quot;life is suffering.&quot;  The book opens in her home - a hovel in disarray populated by chickens, dog, junkies, an altar to Our Lady, and a dove.  It ends with the recognition that only fellow junkies can truly understand another junky - that a vagabond, drunk artist may depict and love but never truly understand.<br />The book's strength is in the passages that reflect most directly the author's mental life - coherent or incoherent - and the role of Buddhism and Catholicism in that mental life.  The book also has a secondary strength of providing insight into the beatniks' rebellion - the shape in took in those who, like Kerouac, seem never to have found a peaceful relationship to the world (in conparison to Gary Synder or Phillip Whalen, for example).<br />Not a book destined to be &quot;top ten of the century&quot;, but an interesting read.	2000-10-23

Sister John of the Cross' interior life is marked off in snippets of the Liturgy of the Hours (primarily psalms)and are timed by the liturgical calendar - Saint James, Apostle (July 25); Martha (July 29); Ignatius of Loyola (July 31) . . . Her life is defined by the rules of her religious order and the liturgy.<br />Her individuality is not suppressed but is expressed through her writing, so well that she has been invited to write a poem to read in Rome on the 100th anniversary of the death of Therese of Liseux.  We are given Sr. John's story of her childhood and calling into the Carmelite Order both in flashbacks and in the novel's changing time - the book's time line is 1997, 1969, 1982, 1994, 1997.  Through these devices we are given a complete spiritual biography through the usual doubts and faith, deserts and ecstasies.  This shows a normal, flawed woman with a normal, flawed spiritual life in a convent with other normal, flawed women and man (priest).<br />The book revolves around a crisis of faith in St. John - a crises brought on by the diagnosis of her mystical experiences as medically based.<br />This is a slim, well crafted novel worth reading.	2000-10-22

Is all Ai? Is moth enlightment found by falling in a well (towards the dark) and relating the experience to the I Ching hexagram? Is the path to happiness plotted in French movies of love? Is life more than digging tunnels, flying towards the light, cannibalism ...?<br />These and the other mysteries of life are explored in Pelevin's The Life of Insects in which the characters are people/insects in an ambiguity changing within a paragraph.  Like Pelevin's The Yellow Arrow the focus is both on post-Communist USSR and in humanity in general.  Also like The Yellow Arrow, the conceit of the novel would fail in the hands of most authors - but Pelevin pulls it off with quiet mastery of his craft.  Add this to your list of must reads.	2000-10-21

This book pulls these and many other literary figures of the era together.  For example, the title poem &quot;Heaven&quot; includes the lines &quot;Phil Whalen will be / a blue cloud / anytime he wants&quot;.<br />The poems in this volume include poems including a series of his blues poems - San Francisco Blues; MacDougal Street Blues; Orizaba Blues; Orlando Blues - and a letter on his theory of jazz poetry.  It includes two short autobiographies and a series of letters between Kerouac and a publisher.<br />The latter gives real insight into his writing: &quot;I would like everybody in the world to tell his full life confession and tell it HIS OWN WAY&quot; from a letter;  or his essentials for modern prose which includes &quot;telling the true story of the world in interior monologue&quot; and &quot; remove literary, grammatical and syntactical inhibition&quot;.<br />The poems themselves show an interesting mixture of Catholic childhood, exposure to Buddhism, and an &quot;in your face&quot; telling it like it is.  They are very much a product of their time which don't survive time well except as icons of their time - and some interesting seeds for era-specific equivalents for our time.<br />I highly recommend the book as a reminder of the beats and what they stood for (and against).	2000-10-19

Books	3	0	3	N	N	As uneven as any anthology	Short-shorts are a natural story form - parables, fables, religious teaching tales, jokes ... Stories in 55 words or less, however, are artifical - essentially placing restrictions on the story as a challenge or exercise.  Such exercises are useful as they develop a sense of the raw materials - words; but as literature only a few succeed.<br />Some of the more enjoyable stories in this collection add additional restrictions - all nouns, words all starting with the same letter, etc. - in a manner similar to the Oulipo group.<br />The stories that work best are one's where the surprise ending is not one of identity ... e.g. the stories work better if the surprise is not who is attempting to murder you but one of that they are trying to kill you.  Bedtime Story by Jeffrey Whitmore is a memorable story that succeeds on this basis.<br />Another type of story that seems to work as literature are those that are not artificially compressed but which could easily be passed on in daily conversation in as compact a from as they are written. A Second Chance by Jay Bonestell fits in this category.<br />I am less impressed by stories such as Rites of Passage which reminded me too strongly of the Country song &quot;I'll Be All Smiles Tonight&quot; - the story set up the misconception that &quot;He&quot; refers to lover or would-be-lover that the actual identity of &quot;Father&quot; only half takes hold.<br />I can recommend this book as a bridge between poetry and prose, as inspiration for writing exercises etc., but I only recommend it as literature for about a quarter of its content.	2000-10-19

In doing so, he takes the short-short out of &quot;current fads&quot; and puts it into legitimate literature.<br />His collection is based on a limit originally of 250 words, raised to 300 - micros not just short-shorts.  The collection gleaned from contests is a very mixed bag - some tales are memorable, some interesting and forgetable, a handful you wonder how they made the cut.  These fall into the normal percentages that an anthology normally presents.<br />Memorable tales: The Poet's Husband by Mollie Giles - a wry look at listening to your spouse's confessional poetry.  The Halo by Michael McFee - the difficulties (and solutions) to raising Jesus.  Worry by Ron Wallace - observations on worry as a dominate family member.  Painted Devils by Fred Chappell - a friendship in trench and safety.<br />A few of the tales strike be as character sketches not narratives; a few seem to have been squished and mangled into a contest form rather than allow the tale to dictate its form.  But given all that, this is a pleasant introduction to the smallest of the small.	2000-10-17

As would be expected from the author's background, the sermon receives significant emphasis.<br />Some of the author's horror stories of bad liturgy are delightfully memorable.

This is one of the more poetic of the prose works in terms of images, using his familiar re-emerging of images slightly modified to emphasize his points.

He builds his story out of small vignettes - real, imagined, and ruminations on either.  These building blocks are often crafted out of the very ordinary - a cup of tea, a widow's birthday dance, a visit to a hospitalized friend, a fruit seller, shoe laces in Bernard's shooes - yet out of these very ordinary observations, a life story is built.<br />In this particular story, precision is emphasized.  For example, parenthetical phrases are given to clarify sentences that are not unclear; these device builds an understanding of the inner thoughts of Bernard without describing and without using an omniscient narrator ... this is only one example of the incredible craft used to build the narrative.<br />This books succeeds in portraying a recently widowed Jew in Palestine coming to grips with the death of his wife and the horrors of WWII - portraying the crisis in understanding of fact, causality, spiritual understanding etc.<br />As this is the third incredibly excellent book I have read by Yoel Hoffman, I am astounded that he is not better known.

These building blocks are often crafted out of the very ordinary - a cup of tea, a widow's birthday dance, a visit to a hospitalized friend, a fruit seller, shoe laces in Bernard's shooes - yet out of these very ordinary observations, a life story is built.<br />In this particular story, precision is emphasized.  For example, parenthetical phrases are given to clarify sentences that are not unclear; these device builds an understanding of the inner thoughts of Bernard without describing and without using an omniscient narrator ... this is only one example of the incredible craft used to build the narrative.<br />This books succeeds in portraying a recently widowed Jew in Palestine coming to grips with the death of his wife and the horrors of WWII - portraying the crisis in understanding of fact, causality, spiritual understanding etc.<br />As this is the third incredibly excellent book I have read by Yoel Hoffman, I am astounded that he is not better known.  Add this to any must read list.	2000-09-30

Frost that capture the humor of Carroll's poem perfectly.  Martin Gardner has provided a short introduction with letters from Carroll to Frost regarding the art and to a friend with regards to para-psychological phenomena.  He also provides notes for obscure words or puns.  Frost and Gardner are what makes this the version of Carroll's Phantasmagoria you should read.<br />The poem itself is a conversation between a man of 42 and a less than adept ghost. Among the things learned are the 5 rules of behavior for a ghost, the housing requirements for a ghost etc.  Carroll's vintage humor is expressed in a narrative poem of seven cantos using verses of five rhymed lines.  The poetry is well written - the rhymes are not forced but natural, the humor relatively subtle.<br />This book justifies its being in the series &quot;Literary Classics&quot;.	2000-09-30

Stirrings Still, a study of death and movement - constrained, absence and free, I have already reviewed.  What Is the Word is a short and effective piece on aphasia as, perhaps, brought on by a stroke.  Both pieces are brilliant, vintage Beckett.	2000-09-30

These truly are curious tales - fascinating, disturbing, unsatisfying.  Many of the stories are told with an editorial &quot;we&quot; narrator coldly providing the &quot;facts&quot;; even the stories told in first person are surprisingly unemotional - the emotion of the narrator being described as a fact, not shown through action.  But on the flip side, Millhauser is a master at setting emotional tone through highly observed details so that these tales do carry an emotional charge.<br />The stories themselves all revolve in some manner around the image of a fascination, a macabre day dream, an imagination taken too far; around the dividing line between normal and obsessive behavior.  Often the stories dance around the dividing line between the real and the artifical.<br />The Knife Thrower tests the limits of knife throwing as entertainment.<br />A Visit tests the limits of the frog/person dichotomy of fairy tales.<br />The Sisterhood of Night shows the exaggerations that fill the void when facts are missing or unacceptable.<br />The Way Out shows an anachronism of honorable behavior catching a modern man unaware.<br />Flying Carpets plays with the fears that would arise if you truly rode a carpet.<br />The New Automaton Theater tests the limits of theater of minature mechanical actors.<br />Clair de Lune follows an adoloscent into the moonlight and a &quot;first love&quot;.<br />The Dream of the Consortium takes the image of a department store to its unachievable limits.<br />Balloon Flight is a soldier's breaking above the enemy blockage only to question the value of his trip.<br />Paradise Park follows the growth of a Coney Island amusement park to its mechanical limit, its fantasy limit, its moral limit.<br />Kaspar Hauser Speaks displays the innermost desires of &quot;a freak&quot;; freak because of being deprived of light, space, food in his early years.<br />Beneath the Cellars of Our Town praises the meditative wanderings in rough tunnels under the city, tunnels for which no map can be drawn.<br />Obviously, Millhauser has allowed his imagination to wander freely.  As entertaining, disturbing stories they are excellent.  As stories representative of something true about human existence, I'm not sure.<br />I am truly left puzzling &quot;I like them, I like them not, I like them ...&quot;nels for which no map can be drawn.<br />Obviously, Millhauser has allowed his imagination to wander freely.

All are well written with plots that have interesting twists and reflect a deep understanding of human relationships.<br />Good Advice Is Rarer Than Rubies is of a charleton giving free advice to a woman seeking a visa to England to join her fiance.  His advice turns out to be valuable.<br />The Free Radio depicts both a cultural clash (old/new) on birth control as a way to view dreams - of a free radio, of being a movie star.<br />The Prophet's Hair tells of the theft/loss/theft/loss of the relic of the Prophet ... and the misfortunes accompanying the relic.<br />Yorick is an exploration of Hamlet's motivations based on his childhood relationship with Yorick and his wife.<br />At the Auction of the Ruby Slippers is a fascinating look at society and dreams. Kansas will never be the same.<br />Christopher Columbus and Queen Isabella of Spain Consummate Their Relationship depicts Christopher gaining the financial backing for his voyage and Isabella's unquechable thirst.<br />The Harmony of the Spheres follows a friendship through the occult, madness, suicide, and truth - the last being, perhaps, the most difficult.<br />Chekov and Zulu - names based on Star Trek - follows two childhood friends through the Indian diplomatic corp, the assasination of Indira Gandhi, and their choices of separate directions.<br />The Courter shows the family and servant relationships of &quot;outsiders&quot; - voluntarily or otherwise - living in London.<br />The Courter is the most poignant of the stories; The Prophet's Hair the most traditional; Christopher Columbus and Queen Isabella of Spain Consummate Their Relationship the most original.<br />This is an excellent collection of short stories.

The description of the form of haiku is very useful; however, it tends to be more proscriptive than the form as practiced.  The collection of haiku is mediocre.<br />If you want to write haiku or teach others to do so, this book should be in your library.  Otherwise, there are better books available.	2000-09-23

The willingness to use footnotes allows the editor to direct the reader's response in a positive way.<br />If you have any interest in haiku, you will want this volume in your collection.	2000-09-23

The work is well designed - delightful illustrations - and has a very rudimentary introduction to Buddhism preceding the stories.  The traditional stories are well told; the original, modern tales frequently succeed.  However, the author often feels obligated to provide a commentary - just a sentence or two - to explain the story.  There are traditional stories that need a comment or two for readers with little or no knowledge of Buddhist or religious teaching stories as a whole.  But often, such as the tale of two monks and a woman carried over a stream, the commentary limits the story's meaning rather than clarifying it.  The author needs to trust the stories.	2000-09-23

If you have read much similar material, the stories will strike you as satisfactory in their retelling but you will have seen much of the material before, often with much more sparkle to the story.<br />The Bird of Prosperity tells of a poor family whose concern for each other gains them wealth and conpares their plight with the plight of a greedy family.<br />The Butter in the Milk is primarily an analogy of God in the universe compared to butter in the milk.<br />The Saint and the Scorpion is a story of the value in following your dharma.<br />The Merchant Who Would Not Go to Heaven is a story of a Merchant who has to many responsibilities to accept an offer to go to heaven.<br />Siva and the Demon, and Narada's Infatuation come from Hindu mythology.<br />The book contains about 25 such stories alone with etching style illustrations; the foreward is best left unread.	2000-09-21

They provide a devotion through Advent that teaches  (or reminds one of) the Old Testament stories.  There is no set group of  stories that constitute an official Jesse tree, which allows the creative  to adjust the tradition to meet specific needs.  For those of us who need  help with the art, this is an excellent collection with art that can be cut  out and hung (the devotion will appear on the back of the ornament) or can  be used in book form, simply leaving the appropriate symbol visible for the  day.  Of course, there are as many other options as those using the booklet  can invent.  The booklet also suggests which symbols should be omitted when  Advent is less than its maximum length.<br />For each symbol a scriptural  reading is suggested, a short reflection is given as is a final  prayer.<br />Symbols include: the Jesse tree, the birth of life, Adam and Eve,  Noah and the flood, Father Abraham, Isaac and the ram, Jacob and his dream,  a symbol of prophecy, Jospeh and his coat, Moses and the law, the blessing  of Aaron, Samuel and the Word of the Lord, David, symbol of shepherds, the  wisdom of Solomon, Elijah and the Raven, Elisha and healing, Isaiah,  Jeremiah, Nehemiah the builder, angels, Zechariah and Elizabeth, Virgin  Mary, Magnificat, the birth of John the Baptizer, Joseph of Nazareth, the  symbol of Bethlehem and the birth of the Lord.<br />My only quibble with the  list is that, in keeping with the geneology of Matthew, I would like to see  Ruth included.	2000-09-18

This has the side effect of making it incompatible with Advent  wreath devotions which are based on the sacred calendar.<br />What makes this  volume a useful resource is that it provides both Hebrew Scripture and New  Testament readings for each day  and that it provides for the Jesse Tree  symbols as craft projects.<br />The symbols provided are: chaos, Adam and Eve,  Noah's ark, Job, Abraham, Isaac and the ram, Jacob and the stairs, Joseph  in prison, Moses and the burning bush, Passover blood, Moses and the law,  Aaron and the altar, David's harp, King Rehoboam (is the negative of wise  and just king), Isaiah, Habakkuk, Ezekiel, the return from exile,  rebuilding of the temple, Son of Righteousness, John the Baptist, Mary,  Joseph, Caesar's proclamation, and birth of Jesus.<br />Note that for brevity  I have emphasized people less than concepts in the list of symbols.  The  collection as a whole is built to emphasize history.	2000-09-18

This is it.  It's structure is  an introduction to cheese making and regulation in general; followed by a  cheese encyclopedia dealing with the making of a family of cheeses for  which an astoundingly broad range of varients are described; this is  followed by a chapter on buying, storing, cutting etc ... i.e. everything  you need to know about handling cheese.  This is followed by about 100  pages of recipes using cheese.  The book is lavishly illustrated, enabling  you to identify and check the quality of nearly all cheeses.<br />The  structure of cheese families and their many variants makes it easy to  relate the information about cheeses in general to the handcrafted cheeses  available in your region.  It contains the most comprehensive list of  cheeses I have ever seen.  There is an index in back for the encyclopedia  and the cheese names are in boldface type, but it still my take a bit to  find a cheese in which you are interested in the text.<br />The illustrations  in addition to providing illustrations of a particular cheese often show  the cheese in various stages of aging.  This is of particular use for  cheeses whose use changes with age or whose peak stage of aging is of  limited duration.<br />This book may be intimidating to someone with no  previous experience in cheeses outside the two or three American standards.  But for anyone who has broadened their tastes into imported or handcrafted  cheeses, this is a perfect volume.	2000-09-17

The book begins with a  personal introduction including information on buying and storing cheese,  on the selection and presentation of cheeses on a cheese platter,  instruments for cutting cheese etc.  This introduction is followed by four  chapters of recipes using cheese: cow's milk cheeses, goat's milk cheeses,  sheep's milk cheeses, and mixed milk cheeses and cheese platters.<br />While  the recipes are excellent, they are why I take exception to the title -  many of the recipes are for the salad course. Other recipes are for breads  or cookies to accompany the cheese  course, some are for excellent  marinades for soft cheeses, some for marinades fruits to accompany the  cheeses - items like goat gouda with roasted hazelnuts and sherried figs  with five alternative cheeses listed make this volume well worth  owning.<br />This is not a book that will introduce you to a wide variety of  cheeses, however, it will provide you with many excellent pairings of  cheese and fruit, as well as many salads for which a cheese is a necessary  ingredient.	2000-09-17

For a novice, it has several  advantages - the pictures of the prepackaged cheeses complete with brand  names, space to write your rown emarks about the cheese... The basic  information given for each chess is: uses, origin, characteristics, related  cheeses, appearance, how to choose it, how to enjoy it.  Occasionally it  provides recipes.<br />A revised book of this type is sorely needed,  especially as our supermarkets and cheese stores expand their basic  selections.  This is of little assistance for handcrafted cheeses but it  takes the novice to the point of appreciating handcrafted cheeses.	2000-09-17

Organized by the country  of origin, it includes brief descriptions of origin, type, tase, appearance  and availability as well as text of varying length giving something of  history, use, regulations of use of name etc.<br />The book is good for  selecting a variant of a particular cheese you can't get.  Reading through  it will inspire you to try some cheese; it's availability information  allows you to determine if the inspiration is realistic.<br />Unfortunately,  as availability has changed, this book has not been updated.  This is  important as the volume does not include Latin American cheeses.<br />I've  seen nothing as simple to use as this volume - the listing alphabetically  within country of origin rather than into cheese families make it very  simple to identify the cheese at hand - but until it is updated, other  cheese books will serve you better.	2000-09-17

For the common fruits  - apples, pears, etc. - it has a entries for the common varieties - a  cooking vs. an eating apple for example. The book begins with useful  information - equipment, preparation, storage etc. Then it devotes a  chapter to each of the major fruit groups: 1. apples, pears, quinces and  medlars 2. stone fruits 3. berries and currants 4. citrus fruits 5. exotic  fruits 6. melons, grapes, figs and rhubarb<br />For each fruit it provides  information on nuitrition, buying, storing, preparing and serve. The  information is understandable and useful.<br />Why am I so stingy with the  stars? Because citrus fruits, melons, and to a lesser extent berries that  are readily available at my local supermarket, are not mentioned.  &quot;Comprehensive&quot; to me means it should at least take a trip to a  farmers' market or ethnic green grocer to find items not listed.	2000-09-17

I highly recommend reading both  as the interplay of the differing sensibilities enhances the value of  each.<br />Ariake in its own right is a beautiful book ... once I got past the  inside covers of pink - the collage illustrations by Grant have a wonderful  interplay with the text, repeating themes with a Japanese feel.  The poetry  is excellent and well translated.  They retain a simple language with  proscribed conceits while working as poetry in English.<br />An example:  &quot;In the blackberry / Night I saw you one last time, / But I let you go  / Without meeting you at dawn, / And now I have learned regret.&quot;<br />For  the technically inclined, the poems are wakas (31 syllable poems  5-7-5-7-7).	2000-09-16

This is easier to use that having to flip the page to get the full  stanza or to compare the schema to the example.<br />The volume contains a  short chapter on meter - I prefer McAuley's Versification for this  material.  It includes a chapter on sounds and a chapter of tropes - there  are several rhetoric books I prefer.<br />Then comes the glory of this book -  the book of forms with a form finder and wonderfully clear definitions of  the form.  The language of origin of the form, the basis of its metrical  scheme (syllablic, accentual etc), a description of the metric and rhyme  schemes and a very clear notation illustrating the scheme are given.  Variants are cross-referenced or included.  Rather than including examples  the book gives a bibliography of examples referring to poems easily  obtained in standard anthologies.<br />This lack of examples forces me to give  the book only 4 stars and recommend the second edition despite my personal  preference.	2000-09-14

The strength of the book is  in its examples, the variety  of sources.  For example, asyndeton in a  series of nouns is illustrated by quotes from the scripture, Shakespeare,  Spinoza, Arnold, Darwin, Proust ... He illustrates asyndeton in series of  clauses; in series of nouns; at the beginning, middle or end of a sentence.  He warns of the effect of overusing the figure ... in short, without ever  become boring, he shows you how to flush out a hiding asyndeton  anywhere.<br />For those of you not educated under my ideal plan - asyndeton  is the omission of conjunctions.  Okay, this particular figure of speech  may not effect your gullibility but I happened to like the examples  given.<br />This book is only introductory but as such it is excellent.  It is  sufficiently slender and diverse to provide basic information without  intimidating the reader with the plethora of classical rhetorical devices.	2000-09-14

He does devote a short final chapter to versification based on accent,  syllable count, free verse and &quot;classical&quot; meters but the book as  a whole focuses on metrical verse.<br />What makes this book a classic is its  constant reference back to stress in normal speech - it suceeds in showing  meterical verse as a natural outgrowth of what we do naturally.  This  dispels quickly any sense of the esoteric - poetry is of and for people in  general not for a special literati.<br />After establishing meter in the  normal sphere of speech, he then goes on to discuss how the abstract  meterical patterns are actually applied and how variety is added to avoid  the sing-song effect.<br />The only flaw in the book is that examples tend to  be extracts rather than full poems, but that is appropriate for the  intended use of the book &quot;a short introduction&quot; as claimed by its  subtitle.<br />This is the only book on English versification you will ever  need.	2000-09-14

Where the first edition had short chapters  on metrics, sonics and tropes, the second edition has more than doubled the  material included and divided it into four levels - typographic, sonic,  sensory and ideational.<br />Then comes the glory of this book - the book of  forms with a form finder and wonderfully clear definitions of the form.  The language of origin of the form, the basis of its metrical scheme  (syllablic, accentual etc), a description of the metric and rhyme schemes  and a very clear notation illustrating the scheme are given.  Variants are  cross-referenced or included.  This material is basically the same as in  the first edition.  However, this book includes sample poems based on the  structure as well as references in the text (unlike the appended  bibliography of the first edition) of other poems in the form.<br />Anyone who  is serious about poetry - either as a reader or a writer - should consider  Turco's Book of Forms as an essential resource.	2000-09-14

After you own Turco, then you should pick up  Williams.  Williams uses the traditional marks for meter; an advantage for  some readers - others will find it less intuitive than Turco's  notation.<br />What Williams provides that Turco does not is more information  on the current use of the form.  His introductory elements of poetic forms  is short and limited to the topic at hand - poetic forms.  His arrangement  of forms provides a more useful structure to learn and understand forms;  while Turco gives the forms in alphabetic order, Williams provides the  following organization (in chapters): 1) fully defined traditional stanza  patterns 2) Loosly defined traditional stanza patterns 3) Traditional poems  of set length 4) Traditional froms of indefinite length 5) Nonspecific  forms and formal elements 6) Variations on the stanzas 7) Variations on the  poems<br />His appendices have fascinating material relating structural  linguistics to prosody, some observations on line breaks and a glossary of  terms.<br />In a classroom setting where teaching the forms as a basis for  literary critique, I would reach first for Williams.  For writing poetry in  forms, I would reach first for Turco.  The best solution is, obviously, to  own both.	2000-09-14

They capture the multiplicity of truth as seen by  multiple people.<br />In a Grove, the basis of the movie Rashomon, consists of  the testimony of several people (including the victim through a medium) in  which three people take responsibility for the death - a robber, the victim  himself and the victim's wife.

There is a very  short historical introduction but the core of the book consists of the  minatures and a text that puts the illustrations in scriptural context.  For example, the first illustration has a haloed figure leaning against a  blue disk with a darker center with a bird flying toward the earth which  forms the core of the disk.  The accompanying text reads &quot;Jehovah  created the heavens and the earth.  After separting them from the waters he  formed the blue disk of the firmament, and, in its midst, he drew from the  darkness the yellowish globe of our earth ...&quot;  The story continues  through the end of Maccabees i.e. the Greek Hebrew Scripture.  This is an  absolutely fascinating look into the interpretation of scripture through  art.	2000-09-13

This leads to the proposition that marsupials are outcasts - the  mammal version of each species being more viable than the marsupial  counterpart. Within this context, the narrator notes that his shins are  sprouting radishes.<br />Seeking treatment at a dermatologist is the beginning  of a series of occurrences - real, dream, illusion, post-anesthetia  confusion?  This are absolutely delightful, humorous events - a bed  traveling in the city through the narrator's mental efforts, of a  hell-based sulfur springs treatment, of child demons, of dead mothers in  cabbage fields, of an American graduate student studying fatal accidents,  of euthansia ...<br />This astounding romp is a serious consideration of  death, our beliefs regarding death (the limbo children) and of  suicide/murder/euthansia/accident.	2000-09-13

The Anglo-Saxom instruments used in illuminations are shown  in a photograph; you aren't expected to have detailed knowledge of medieval  tools.  The color plates of the Gospels  are magnificant.  The art shown  for comparison includes not only other manuscripts but metalwork  etc.<br />This book is not only an introduction to the Lindisfarne Gospels but  is a good starting point for illuminated manuscripts in general.	2000-09-13

These  description provide a variety of information - bits of biography of the  artist, history of the manuscript (confirmed and confirmed), information  regarding the style, the imagery etc.  The &quot;chapter&quot; material  provides samples of the texts, the development of the specific portion of  the Book of Hours, etc.  This provides the overall context for the  materials.<br />The indices provide access by manuscript, artist, early  owners; an appendex provides the outline of the major offices by incipit  (first phrase) to place individual illustrations in the overall context of  the prayer hour.<br />Don't be intimidated - the text is easily followed but  one unfamilar with the prayer book content or with illuminated manuscripts.

Yes, they are all known as religious figures;  they also are known as friends of animals - teaching animals, learning from  them, or protecting them (or vice versa).  This delightful book tells a  variety of tales about the animals.  This range from simple observations -  learning the stillness of meditation from a cat over a mousehole, to  full  blown stories.  Information setting the story in place, time and  manuscript(hagiographic reference) is provided for each story.<br />This is  (a) a perfect antidote to a cold, stormy night (b) a perfect antidote to  over-rationalized religion (c) an excellent introduction to hagiography (d)  all of the above.

He is a  master of the one or two page sketch that illuminates a sliver of human  behavior.<br />In this collection,  you feel as if you're listening to a keen  observer, a quiet storyteller reminscing about childhood on a midwestern  farm - corn, pigs, cows, chickens i.e. very diversified farming.  The  characters consistent primarily of the boys, the youngest boy, the men,  with guest appearances of the preacher, town boys, and  grandfather.<br />Whether you're reading about the preacher who passed gass,  the gypsies at the old school yard, grandfather teaching the boys to make  firefly flashlights, the youngest boy hiding in a dip until a dandelion  seemed to breath, hunting June bugs with old ping-pong paddles, you'll  enjoy the honesty, earthiness, innocence, and style of these  stories.<br />Literature that will change the world?  No.  Literature that  will be known in a century?  Probably not.  But for pure delight,  especially if you were raised on a farm, this book is great fun.	2000-09-10

No, I don't believe that Mother Goose should move over for this book although I would be quite willing to make Mother Goose do  international.<br />The intent of this book - to provide a resource for finger  play and action verses - is admirable; as a resource it is well organized,  chapters on: familar animals, exotic animals, seasons/holidays,  people/places, cooking and eating, home and family, fun and games, color  and numbers.  The problem is that no author can write 100+ pages of one or  two rhymes each and maintain the quality that you can find in the folk  tradition or anthologies.<br />Some of the animal verses seem influenced by  Ogden Nash - but I would go the O.N. each time:  Example: &quot;A boa  constrictor / May look like his sister, / But don't make a fatal mistake: /  A boa constrictor / Can look like his sister / And still be a dangerous  snake!&quot; [I won't subject my children or grandchildren to this].<br />On  the other hand, I find some rhymes that are quite delightful: &quot;Pierre  the Bear! O tell me where / To look for honey trees. / If you don't mind,  I'd like to find / The ones without the bees!&quot;<br />The book can be a  useful resource but only as one of several resources.	2000-09-09

The selection of nursery rhymes in this book shows the knowledge of what children really  have an affinity for that she gained over that time.  This is not a  collection of what adults think children ought to lie - it's a collection  of what they do like.<br />The illustrations and the layout of the book  continue the quality of what children like.  The layout gives no more than  one rhyme per page.  This limits the contents of the book but matches the  attention space of the age the book targets.  The illustrations are not of  humans but of animals in the lineage of Richard Scarry, the Bernsteins,  etc.  This gives the book a cozy, lap feeling that is age  appropriate.<br />Grandchildren and grandnieces/nephews have all received this  book.  In all cases it became the Mother Goose of choice for parent and  child.  That is the best recommendation the book could have.	2000-09-09

The reasons portion of this book - discussing child development and the  role of rhymes and games in that development is good - not better or worse  than a dozen similar books.<br />But when one moves to Part II: Rhymes for  Verse and Play, the book distinguishes itself - one of the best available.  While it is multicultural by design it is also multicultural because it  chooses the best of the best.<br />For example, rocking songs include: Sweet  Water Rolling from South Carolina, A white hen from France, Hopi Lullaby,  Pima Wind Song, The Ballad of Downal Baun from Ireland, Hati Jhulare from  India, Samoan Rock-a-bye, Rock-a-bye Baby Thy Cradle is Green from Ingland,  The Sleepy Song which is unattributed, Huch 'n Bye another from South  Carolina, Schlaf Kindlein Schlaf from Germany, Sweet and Low by Alfred  Tennyson  ... My only complaint is that music is not given for all of them.  But in the best folk tradition, the parent can improvise - the baby has  few expectations regarding ethnic music.<br />The are equivalent chapters for  peek-a-boo, facial feature games, clapping, bouncing, lifting, tickling and  finger play.<br />My only complaint - the bibliography is designed for child  development not folklore.<br />If you can possibly find a copy of this for new  parents, nap it.	2000-09-09

The poems also work if one judges  them as vignettes rather than poetry.  Yoga Lessons is the strongest piece  as poetry.  Even as vignettes, however, the ubiquous use of first person,  which works well for the poems in isolation, fails to work in the  collection as the reader gets many &quot;I's&quot; of which some are the  same and others not.

Other items I know  as folk songs e.g. &quot;I had a cat and the cat pleased me&quot;.  Others  have longer versions than normally appear in Mother Goose although the  additional verses are often traditional e.g. Jack and Jill; this trait is  the one most apt to disturb the adults - they often wish to read the rhymes  as they remember them.  I would also expect some complaints about some of  the violence - spanking etc.; I see these as an opportunity to introduce  the child to the fact that the world is not composed of perfect people.  Letting children hear or see something is not the same as approving the  behavior.<br />The real strength of this volume is the thought given to  sequence.  Open to any page and you will see pictures which are compatible  with each other, rhymes that are compatible, that create a nice flow.  The  illustrations are a wonderful mix of realism, animal-people, and humor - a  pig so puffed it appears to float.  While the pictures have a taste of old  to them - especially those accompanying rhymes with archaic subject matter  - the pictures are appealing to the contemporary child.	2000-09-09

Some of the riddles are unlikely  to be solved by a child, but the answers and the riddles themselves give  insight into the culture from which they come.  Note that the cultural  source is always given.<br />Other riddles are accompanied with pictures that  give a hint so that the child can answer some of the riddles - a nice touch  to keep the child's interest and confidence.<br />An example: &quot;Wonder,  wonder / Who can she be? / The dark lady on her golden chair.&quot; Answer:  a pot on the fire (Guarani from Paraguay).<br />The source of the riddles  (&quot;Who the Riddlers Are&quot;) is a clever mix of information useful to  a child - pronunciation of the tribe's name, a more detailed description of  their location, a index to the riddles attributed to them, and the source  of the riddles.  &quot;Sources&quot; provides a traditional  bibliography.<br />There is a wonderful introduction to riddles and their  cultural place - in gambling, dance, initiation rites, within stories  etc.<br />A wonderful addition to a child's multicultural library.	2000-09-09

The illustrations are often wonderful but fail because there is  no visual dividing line between them e.g. the children going round the  mulberry bush fit with the children playing jump rope but to play into  butter and beans ... with a bean pot larger than the children is a visually  jarring.  Even in the black and white pages where there is a clear  distinction of one picture per rhyme, the volume of material stuffed on a  page gives a cluttered, uninviting feeling.<br />Why then do I go for 4 stars?

This gives it the advantage of containing the rhymes my generation recites with ease.  However, if one looks at it objectively, the order of the rhymes is often a  result of poem or picture size rather than a comfortable flow ... the  equivalent of a DJ ordering the songs by the color of the label. [insert  your own argh]<br />The pictures were quaint when I was growing up.

Unfortunately, she makes no distinction between liturgical and  paraliturgical which is a fatal flaw as she requests that the participants  &quot;create&quot; liturgical prayer; she means to create structured,  corporate prayer using words, gestures, symbols etc. i.e.  paraliturgy.<br />Her distinction between liturgy and personal prayer is  equally flawed.  Despite the bibliographic reference to Paul Bradshaw's  work on cathedral vs. monastic prayer (the former being corporate in  nature, the latter being personal), she attributes spontaneity as a mark of  personal prayer while at the same time requesting a revisiting of  traditional devotions which are frequently not spontaneous.  She seems to  fall into the &quot;mystic is best&quot; trap - giving examples of personal  prayer as meditation, breathing exercises, etc. (explicitly referring to  Eastern religions' prayer forms) while ignoring the guts of personal prayer  - petition, intercession, thanksgiving.<br />The sessions that she has  outlined for the Catechumenate Team Formation may well backfire.  From  personal experience (not as leader), I know that bread is too loaded a  symbol for Catholics to be used in the context she suggests - the reactions  to its use in a group far more selected in favor of approving of the use of  the symbol ranged from &quot;the most meaningful prayer experience&quot; to  &quot;presider must be a priest wanna-t-be&quot; or &quot;verging on  sacreligious, an abuse of the symbol&quot;.  I would be similarly, but more  mildly, concerned with the sprinkling rite.  Oils, with proper background,  do seem to work.<br />The intent of the book is good - to make the RCIA team  sufficiently aware of liturgy to prepare the catechumens not only for  &quot;The Liturgy&quot; (Mass) but for the preparatory and sacramental  liturgies in which they will be participating.participating.	2000-09-08

The story is based on history -  in a forward the author explains how he came upon the material and came to  write the novel based on it.<br />The story follows Brother Jacob, a Danish  prince, through the expulsion of the Franciscans from Denmark in the  Lutheran tide, through his wanderings in Europe until he comes to Spain,  through his final years as a missionary priest in Mexico.  The power of the  book comes in two forms - first, the forcing the reader to acknowledge the  violence of the era; second, the acknowledgement of the wavering of faith  as the Catholic church to which Brother Jacob had dedicated his life fails  to reform itself, wrongly prosecutes those trying to reform it.<br />On a more  hopeful note, one sees Brother Jacob, along with some other priests, truly  interested in the native population, trying to preserve their myths and  histories, trying to insure they be treated as fully human.<br />Some of the  more interesting points to me include the description of Thomas More's  original sentence before it was commuted to beheading - the depths of  violence that I had not realized was present that recently; Brother Jacob's  use of St. Francis Brother Sun, Sister Moon etc. to modify the natives  beliefs by fullfilment rather than eradication; the attempt to recreate the  Utopia as described by More in a rebuilding of the lives of the indigenious  peoples; the proposal that Our Lady of Guadalupe was engineered to keep the  indigenious peoples down ...<br />This novel is a slow read - the prose is  dense and much of the plot unfolds in Br. Jacob's thoughts rather than in  conversation and action ... but there is enough action to provide a plot  line that makes you want to know &quot;what next?&quot;  And many times,  you need to stop and ponder the ramifications of what you have just read -  what it tells you about the era, about humanity in general.<br />I recommend  this book very highly especially for those with an interest in history,  religion, Middle American indigenious cultures, human response to major  cultural shifts ...anity in general.<br />I recommend  this book very highly especially for those with an interest in history,  religion, Middle American indigenious cultures, human response to major  cultural shifts ...	2000-09-07

Perhaps I was too put off by the comment in the forward that early Greek  poetry was being neglected because it wasn't kept alive by be scriptural as  the Rg Veda, the Psalms, etc. to give this book a fair chance.  I can too  easily identify other early and neglected poetry - Egyptian, Tamil,  Sumerian, or the Avestan.<br />The selection of poems makes a nice mix  -Archilochos, Alkman, Sappho, Alkaios, Erinna, Stesichoros, Ibykos,  Anakreon, Solon, Mimnermos, Timokreon of Rphodes, Simonides, Phokylides,  Praxilla, Socrates, Plato, Kallimachos, Theokritos ...<br />Unfortunately, as  it doesn't suit my taste, so poems are made from multiple fragments, some  poems which survived intact are given only a fragment here.  The poems are  decent poetry, but unlike Barnhard's translation of Sappho, I feel that I  am reading a modern mind's interpretation of the ancient mind rather than  reading a translation of a poem by an ancient.<br />Still, the book serves a  real purpose as an introduction to early Greek poetry without being  scholarly or obtuse.	2000-09-05

The paintings come from two  volumes in the Institute of Oriental Studies in St. Petersburg.  The  paintings are not Mughal minatures within a book - the books are the  paintings with inscriptions on Sanskrit and Persian.<br />The volume begins  with two pictures featuring Ganesha, the elephant-head god for auspicious  begins.  The pictures are traditional - the god being identified with the  traditional mount - for Ganesha this is a rat - and traditional attributes  - for Ganesha holding a plate of sweets.  The comments on the paintings  provides this information - thus the book becomes a short, practical course  in Hindu iconography.<br />The book contains, in addition to Ganesha, the  Hindu triad, the incarnations of Vishnu, the manifestations of Shiva and  the Great Goddess, various popular dieties (Hanumanm Garuda, Varuna, Agni  ...), the deities of the planets and of the signs of the zodiac.<br />These  are certainly not the best minatures of the dieties you'll ever see, but  they are good and the book as a whole is an excellent introduction to the  Hindu pantheon.	2000-09-04

This includes Morning Prayer and  Evening Prayer which are to be encouraged as communal prayer in our  parishes; the Office of Readings; Mid-morning, mid-day and midafternoon  prayers; night prayer and a series of optional extensions to these hours.  Each year a pamphlet is printed to guide the user to the correct prayers,  psalms and readings for the day.<br />These volumes are excellent for those  familiar with the Liturgy of the Hours but are intimidating for those less  familiar.  To obtain the right units you must look at the section of  unchanging prayers; at the section of the 4 week Psalter; perhaps at the  propers for the season or feast; and finally, at the units specific to the  day and hour.  The volumes come equiped with ribbons to help keep your  place.<br />For someone unfamiliar with the liturgy, I would recommend a  simplified version.  For others, this is the best edition currently  available.	2000-09-03

This book falls into the second  category - traditional teaching tales. Fr. de Mello has categorized the  stories into seven chapters: spirituality, education, authority, human  nature, relationships, service and enlightment. Most of the stories are  told without any &quot;editorial&quot; comments i.e. the author trusts the  power of story. The selection is excellent coming from a wide variety of  traditions and ages.<br />An example: &quot;When the preacher returned to the  Good News theme the Master interrupted him: 'What sort of Good News is it,'  he asked, 'that makes it so easy to go to hell and so hard to get to  heaven?'&quot;  Please recall that it is a Catholic priest who wrote this  book.<br />You can read the book straight through and get a lot of laughs or  you can read it as intended, pondering the stories and risking having your  life changed.

The short section of  recipes revolve around, but are not limited to, this set of herbs - Okrosha  (a cold soup from Russia), chervil soup, fish salad etc.  Some call for an  unspecified mixture, others for specific herbs.<br />This volume unfortunately  does not stand alone well.  It needs a companion volume of salad greens as  some recipes include ingredients such as &quot;small letuce leaves and  other non-bitter small salad greens&quot;, watercress etc.  Nonetheless, it  is a fun addition to a kitchen library.	2000-09-03

It provides a serious of traditional prayers, stations of  the cross, rosary, commendation of the dying, hymns in Latin and English  etc.<br />Morning prayer follows a two week cycle and consists of a prayer, a  psalm, a Scriptural reading, the Our Father, the Hail Mary and a concluding  prayer. Evening prayer follows a one week cycle in the same pattern. Night  prayer is unvarying - a prayer, a psalm, a reading, the Nunc Dimittis a  concluding prayer and blessing with an optional antiphon to Mary.<br />An  interesting touch is that each page has, in the position of a footnot, a  proverb or statment for reflection.<br />This volume is exceptionally well  printed and easy to use.  It serves as an excellent starting point for  praying of the psalms and Scripture.	2000-09-03

An index in the back allows you to find produce by an  alternative name.  An index in the front sorts the recipes by type.<br />To  give an indication of its range the first few entries are: arugula, asian  pear, atemoya, blood orange, bok choy, bolete, boniato, breadfruit ...  The  books gives a basic introduction to the history and geography of the plant,  guides for selection and storage, basic preparation, nutritional value and  recipes.  For breadfuit, for a green breadfruit there is a salad recipe,  for a medium ripe on there are soup and pudding recipes.<br />The recipes are  all practical, everyday meal recipes.  This book is an excellent guide for  using the produce items that are more recently added to your supermarket  produce bins.	2000-09-03

These services  follow the official guidelines with the renaming of the Prayer of praise  (usually a psalm, the Te Deum, or similiar piece) to Prayer of the  community (written by the author).<br />The introductory rites include  traditional penitential rites with introductions for the presider and an  opening prayer.  Then follows a celebration of the Word where the presider  is not given material for the reflections on the Word or the intercessory  prayers.  This is followed by the Prayer of the Community with the Sanctus,  the proclamation of faith, and the traditional closing of the Eucharistic  Prayer; note it lacks the prayer uniting the worshiping community to the  Church at large.  This is followed by a prayer of Thanksgiving and final  blessing.<br />The volume contains services for the main liturgical seasons -  advent, Christmas, Lent, Easter and Ordinary Time - but rather than having  the prayers thematically connected to the liturgical date and lectionary  readings, the services are thematically centered on topics such as  &quot;The Compassionate One&quot;, &quot;Holy Wisdom&quot;,  &quot;Seeds&quot;, &quot;Treasures&quot;.<br />The overall result is a book  that has not evolved organically from the rituals that are its  predecessors.  Ritual meaning is very difficult newly create ... and this  book fails.	2000-09-03

It provides essays on St. Benedict, the Liturgy or the Hours,  praying the Psalms, Lectio etc. so that the person using the book knows  what they are doing.<br />The volume contains Evening and Morning Prayer for a  two week cycle.  Note that it has the traditional pattern of Evening  preceding Morning.  Evening prayer begins with the traditional sentence and  Glory be followed by a season antiphon and three Psalms.  This is followed  by a Scriptural reading, a seasonal antiphon and the Magnificat,  intercessions, Our Father and a final prayer and blessing.  Morning prayer  follows a similiar pattern with the Benedictus rather than the  Magnificat.<br />This is an excellent volume for those wanting something  longer than Saint Benedict's Prayer Book but less complex than the full  Liturgy of the Hours.  This volume works very well as an individual prayer  book while still retaining connections to the community as a whole.<br />The  book is well designed and printed - very easy to use and highly  recommended.	2000-09-03

For example, I have only recently found a source for red rice; this  book distinguishes between Thai red rice, mahogany rice, Bhutanese red  rice, Himalayan red rice, South Indian red rice, South Asian red rice,  Vietnamese red cargo rice and Wehani.  Reading the differences, even  without knowledge of what red rice I bought, allows me to adjust the  recipes conservatively so that I don't over-cook, over-power or otherwise  mutilate my find.<br />The recipes are well chosen; many of the recipes are  not rice recipes but dishes to accompany rice.  This gives the book a  greater range than its title might imply.  The stories of learning the  worldwide recipes on site add to the enjoyment of the recipes; they provide  a travelogue of the search for new rices and rice uses.  They are  accompanied with excellent photographs of growing, harvesting, and cooking  rice.<br />Recipes come from Italy, Mexico, Japan, Turkey, Thailand, India,  China, USA, Senegal, Persia, Jamaica, Spain, Uighur (Russian-Chinese  border).  There is an index by the geographic region which allows the book  to serve as an ethnic cookbook.<br />This is a cookbook to read and to use.  I  definately recommend it.	2000-09-03

Anthony de Mello was a Jesuit priest of Portuguese-South Asian descent  who used his dual heritage as a retreat leader.  This particular volume  begins with exercises common to all mystical traditions i.e. awareness and  contemplation exercises.  The section of fantasy exercises owe much to the  Ignatian Exercises (as in St. Ignatius the founder of the Jesuit order)  although expanded.  The final set of exercises include a number of  traditional prayer methods - the Benedictine method, the Jesus prayer  associated with the Orthodox, the Thousand Names of God, Gospel Sentences  similar to lectio divina etc.<br />This book works better as a source book for  retreat leaders or spiritual directors in that it is disruptive to  prayer/awareness/contemplation to break to refer to the instructions.  However, individuals certainly can benefit from the volume.	2000-09-03

The value of the book is in the photographs.  This book includes not only  old work and recent work but even work in progress.  It includes  petroglyphs, masks, dugouts, baskets, jewlery, totel poles, rattles, spoons  i.e. a full introduction to the material culture.  It also includes  photographs of the region allowing one to envision the physical space in  which the Native Americans lived.<br />I find the book as a whole much more  like a tour of a well-planned musuem display than like an art book.  As  such it is enjoyable.	2000-09-03

First, you use the addresses given to order seed ... select from nearly 60 items.  Grow.  Hand select leaves to construct salad.  Wash.  Dress. Build salad a leaf at a time.<br />Seriously, that is the  strength of this cookbook.  If you chose, you may start with the  information on how to grow herbs - from the basics to those requiring very  special care.  Then in using the herbs, the recipies give a wide variety of  options allowing you to adjust the recipes to ingredients available to you.  At the same time, you are shown new uses for herbs or new herbs to  substitute for your old standbys.  An example of the approach is the salad  - the leaves are served whole, in cutting and gathering the ingredients  onto the fork, the diner is allowed to choose what flavors he or she wishes  to mix together - a subtlety of approach that was new to me.<br />The recipes  are in general very practical - some clearly &quot;company&quot; dishes ,  other appropriate for every day.  The recipes often include background on  the cooking practices that lead to the recipe.  For example whole fish  grilled on fennel stalks describes how fennel grows, its uses in the  Mediterranean as a grilling bed, and then slide into the recipe.<br />This  book should be considered high on the required cookbooks list for those who  enjoy cooking with fresh herbs - and for those who don't to show them why  they should.	2000-09-02

I always find a recipe for the vegetable  in hand that is appropriate to the occasion for which I am cooking -  myself, family, guests or a festive dinner.<br />The book includes a first  person introduction to the use of the vegetable, its growing conditions,  etc.  The intent is to get the feel of a private conversation with the  author regarding the vegetable.  There are general instructions for  preparation for those who prefer to wing it rather than follow recipes.  There are a variety of recipes for the vegetable which generally include at  least one for each of the basic preparations.  Then there are nice tables  of yields, storage, use for leftovers, hints for use, even microwave  instructions.  The book has color photos of the various vegetables,  including photos of preparation of the vegetable.<br />The vegetables  included, some of which are families of vegetables not a single vegetable  are: asparagus, beans, beets, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots,  cauliflower, celeriac, celery, corn, cucumbers, eggplant, endive, fennel,  greens, Jerusalem artichokes, kale, kohlrabi, leeks, okra, onion, parsnips,  peas, peppers, potatoes, pumpkins, radishes, salad greens, salsify,  spinach, summer squash, winter squash, sweet potatoes, Swiss chard,  tomatoes, turnips &amp; rutabagas.<br />This is the only vegetable cookbook  you'll ever need.	2000-09-02

One Minute Wisdom falls into this  latter category using a style related to the saying of the rabbis in the  talmudic writings or certain collections of Hindu avatar sayings.<br />The  purpose of the sayings is to provoke a response, to help one to break out  of the habitual patterns of thought and action that substitute for rather  than express religious beliefs.<br />An example: &quot;To everyone's surprise  the Master seemed unenthusiastic about religious education for the young.  When asked why, he said, &quot;Innoculate them when they are young and you  prevent them from catching the real thing when they grow up.&quot;<br />The  book can be read for amusement or to change one's life.

However, the same jarring use of syntax (words rather  than phrases) is a significant reason that the poem The Sibyl works very  well.  His renderings (translations from Greek) are splendid poetry.  In  short, in this volume I found a range from poems I found unneccesarily  opaque to absolute gems, everything from meditations on what it means to be  gay and moral to studies of Greek gods.  This is a book that each reader  must decide for themselves if this is a book for them - some will love it,  others will not - and both will be fair accessments.	2000-08-31

In the art the selection is marvelous  Jose Clemente, John August Swanson, Giovanni Battisto, El Greco ... the  variety of images of Christ presented is excellent, the printing of them is  adequate.  Unfortunately, the quotes are less broadly selected - they are  biased towards the Jesus Seminar and Bishop Sprong theological threads.  However, there are some wonderful selections from individuals such as  Sojourner Truth, Corazon Aquino, Tolstoy, Napolean.<br />This is not a safe  volume to give to a conservative Christian unless you know them very well.  However, it can be a choice for those who are theologically liberal in  today's terminology, who are seekers, or who are interested in religion and  Western culture in a more abstract manner.	2000-08-31

The introduction is very brief; the editor allows the  selected passages to speak for themselves which they do beautifully.  Some  of the material is very specifically Jewish in the sense of relating  directly to Jewish history; but most of it speaks to religious truth in the  sense found in most religions.<br />An example: &quot;Someone came before  Rabab and said: 'The mayor of my town has told me: Go and kill so and so;  it you do not, I will have you killed.'

The illustrations by Bryan are a  superb counterpoint to the text - again geared intentional towards children  - but showing excellent use of color and a realism appealing to adults.<br />This book succeeds in being truly for children without being sacchrine  or insulting.

In the biographical series of interned  Japanese, the poets' confidence that the story itself is sufficient creates  very effective poems - simple language, well chosen details - and a person  is drawn.  In the mythic poems she uses more &quot;poetic&quot; language  and imagery while retaining a highly effective simplicity.  In the  biographic poems, the segment that includes prose poems, there is a  different sensibility, one drawn from hunting, from social isolation as the  child of a war bride - a bride who married the enemy.<br />The most impressive  feature of this volume is the confidence of the poet - the trusting of her  skill, the power of story, the power of words.  While much of the message  of the poetry regards the policy of internment, the destruction of  Hiroshima/Nagasaki, racial prejudice, childhood embarrassment of parents  that are &quot;other&quot; etc., there is no trace of the diadactic in the  poems.

There are two appendix: one for  exposition and benediction in the context of Evening Prayer, the other for  exposition and benediction as a standalone service.<br />The a variety of  forms offered as alternatives so that any parish should find a form that  meets their specific pastoral requirements.

In this volume he teams with Anne  Waldman to translate selections from the Therigatha and Theragatha  collections in the Pali Tripitaka (Buddhist scripture) into English.  In  some cases they include the prose which sets the scene in which the  song/poem was created.  They have found the true gems and given us  translations which do not depend upon the reader having detailed knowledge  of the Theravadan Buddhist tradition.<br />An example: &quot;You have your old  cottage / now you want a new one / but friend don't you realize / a new  cottage is just / a new anguish&quot;<br />This is an excellent introduction  to a little known portion of Buddhist texts.	2000-08-27

For example a call to worship based on Psalm  34:3 has the leader say &quot;Glorify the Lord with me&quot; to which the  people respond &quot;Let us exalt his name together&quot;.<br />I do not,  however, find this portion sufficient to justify recommending the book.	2000-08-26

In short, I highly recommend this translation.	2000-08-24

Anyone leading a parish RCIA program should be familiar with these rites.  As in all official liturgical ritual books, there is an official  introduction which sets forth the official theology and expectations for  the use of these rites.<br />The rites are as follows: (1) acceptance into the  order of catechumens with optional rites (2) period of the catechumenate  with liturgy of the word, blessings, anointings etc (3) rite of election  (4) the scrutinies with special rites for Holy Saturday (5) sacraments of  initiation.<br />The modifications to the above cycle are given for children  who have reached catechetical age, adults in exceptional circumstances, for  those in danger of death, for those already baptized seeking full  communion, and for uncatechized adults (Catholics baptized but not raised  in the faith).<br />An appendix gives the forms for the various rites when  combined with other rites.  A variety of songs and hymns are included as  are the national statutes regarding the catechumenate i.e. the national  implementation of the material provided as a forward.	2000-08-24

However, the publisher correctly produces the ritual book as the  book is officially blessed.  In that context, I appreciate that this is a  dual language ritual book - Spanish and English.<br />As is usual with  official ritual books, the book begins with the decrees, theology and  regulations associated with the rites.  The volume provides three services  with which the distribution of communion may be combined - morning prayer,  evening prayer and the liturgy of the Word.  Suggested general  intercessions are provided which are useful where the presider is  uncomfortable writing the intercessions.  A variety of acts of thanksgiving  are offered - primarily Psalms but also hymns and canticles.  Prayers are  given for all Sundays and other feast days.  Blessings are given in forms  for laity and for deacons.  The final section is the official document  setting forth the conditions for the use of the service.<br />The production  of this book has given excellent consideration to readability and  useability.	2000-08-24

A Ritual for Laypersons is, in effect, an  intermediate ritual book.  Chapter 1 contains basically the same material  as Communion of the Sick; Chapter 2 covers Communion and Viaticum (final  rites).  Chapters 3 and 4 cover pastoral care for the sick, adult and child  respectively.  Note that the sacrament of anointing is reserved for the  ordained; this book contains rites lay persons can administer.  Chapters 5  and 6 contain commendation of the dying and prayers after death  respectively.<br />The volume is very usable, providing a sufficient variety  of texts that a minister can select appropriate texts for the specific  individuals to whom they are ministering.	2000-08-24

It provides the rite in ordinary  circumstances, the normal rite for homebound; it also provides the rite for  hospitals or institutions where the minister goes from room to room.  It  provides a sufficient variety of reaadnings and prayers that one can return  to the same home week after week without fear of become repetitive in a  negative sensse.<br />The book is well designed; the user can easily follow  the instructions, there is no necessity to page flip as liturgical books  often require.  Highly recommended as a basic book.	2000-08-24

However, this is the book anyone planning or  coordinating Worship of the Eucharist should turn to.<br />As with most  official ritual books this begins with a general introduction setting forth  the theology and regulations surrounding the rites.  Chapter 1 corresponds  to the basic book Communion of the Sick.  Chapter 2 covers some but not all  of the additional material in A Ritual for Laypersons.  Chapter 3 sets  forth three forms of worship of the Holy Eucharist - exposition (without  optional benediction), eucharistic processions and eucharistic congresses.  Chapter 4 provides a number of appropriate scripture readings, antiphons,  responsories, and prayers.  An appendix sets for the most common form of  exposition and benedition and for combined those rites with evening  prayer.<br />All the production concerns of a ritual book that make it useable  have been appropriately addressed.	2000-08-24

The final chapter discusses the  Shepardi community and the patrons who could fund such an effort as the  Golden Haggadah.<br />For those interested for ritual purposes as well, see  The Illuminated Haggadah - the ritual text with illuminations from the  British Library including several also in this book.<br />For anyone  interested in religious art or Medieval illuminations, this book is a must  have as it explores an aspect of illuminated manuscripts unknown to many of  us Gentiles.	2000-08-21

I have a love/hate relationship with H.D. - I lack her enthusiasm for  Greek and Egyptian mythology (I'd rather move a bit further to the  Southeast) but I appreciate what she does with the mythology.  Thus I am  never quite sure to what audience I can recommend her.<br />The second piece  in this book, &quot;The Wise Sappho&quot; is a meditation on the poetry of  Sappho - a poetic meditation.  If you have read Sappho, this is a must read  piece as both Sappho and H.D. are talismen of the feminist strand of  poets.<br />The first piece &quot;Notes on Thought and Vision&quot; needs to  be placed in time.  H.D. speaks of her discovery of a higher level of  consciousness, a level she refers to as jelly-fish mind as she imagines it  as a jelly-fish above us (for brain consciousness) or beside us (for womb  consciousness) with tenacles into our body.  Her examples come primarily  from art, Greek mythology or &quot;the Galilean&quot; (Jesus).  She  specifically includes scientists among those dependent upon this jelly-fish  consciousness.  However, she cautions that body and mind are not to be  neglected.  Her description of her experience serves as an important  insight into her poetry and prose and as one ray into understanding the  literary circle in which she roamed e.g. Ezra Pound.	2000-08-21

A significant number of the  pieces are pictured.  The text mixes technical information about the art  pieces with information about how they came into the collection.  The art  itself ranges from primitive to superb folk art - executed in a variety of  media.  Among the pieces that catch my attention is a crucifix with an  angel at Jesus' side and the retablo of Our Lady of Refuge.<br />This is an  excellent volume for those interested in folk devotional art or Mexican /  Southwestern art.	2000-08-21

The  result is a splendid, visually appealing book.  The illuminations run from  vines running down the margins of the page, to elaborate Hebrew letters,  folk illustrations, and icon-like depictions of Biblical scenes.  Here and  there a bit of commentary on the contents of the ritual is included.  It is  clear that the hope of the authors that the Haggadah be not only a  beautiful book on your shelf but also be used as a beautiful book in the  celebration of Passover.	2000-08-21

This  volume has a forward which identifies some of the fictional names with the  actual names of the individuals portrayed.<br />Unlike Bulgakov's other  novels, this could occasionally improve by editing - a third of a page of  jobs constituting all of humanity is a bit much.  The characters are in  general very specific personalities in which Bulgakov assumes that  character recognition relieves him of the duty to provide fully fleshed out  characters.<br />On the flip side, the novel is an amusing and telling romp  through the hidden side of theater and Bulgakov's humorous skill is  unscathed by the novel's shortcomings.  Even well-worn humor such as  mistaken names becomes fresh in Bulgadov's hands.<br />I recommend this book  to theater and Bulgakov junkies; for others I would neither encourage nor  discourage you from picking up the volume.	2000-08-20

He brings together teachings of the early church  fathers, Vatican II council, and the most recent Cathechism to show how  Mass on earth is one with the heavenly Mass.  He does so in non-technical  language and persuasive language.  Occasionally, as in his discussion on  evil in the world, I would disagree with his theology but his theology  represents one thread of Catholic theology.  Therefore, I suggest that this  book be read critically, expecting that you may not agree with him  entirely.  But even where there is disagreement his arguments are well  worth hearing.<br />An example of his thought.  Rather than seeing the second  coming, the Parousia, as a coming event, he sees Revelation (also  translatable as \\"unveiling\\") as pointing to parousia perpetually  occurring in the Mass.  He martials both Scripture and tradition to confirm  this point.<br />All in all this book is a very accessible study of Revelation  and The Liturgy, that I recommend.	2000-08-19

Often there are notes leading to recordings of the works or to other source  books.  There are also notes regarding the collection of the piece.  The  illustrations are delightful period pieces that truly enhance the  volume.<br />I have found pieces here that my father learned as recitations  not songs; it is unusual to find turn-of-the-century northwest items in  collections such as this.<br />Highly recommended to any fan of the Library of  Congress folk recordings, folklorist, folk musician or anyone else with an  interest in this field.	2000-08-19

This collection is of quatrains and odes.<br />In this collection  fewer of the poems use specifically Sufi imagery than in some collections;  e.g. &quot;Late, by myself, in the boat of myself&quot; could as easily be  Buddhist or Hindu; this makes the poetry more obviously universal than some  collections.  There are, of course, the more specifically Sufi tavern/wine  images, e.g. &quot;They say that Paradise will be prefect / with losts of  clear white wine and all the beautiful women&quot;.<br />These translations  are meant for, and work best for, the individual reading for the spiritual  content of Rumi rather than the scholar interested in Persian poetry.	2000-08-19

Salman Rushdie plays on the ocean of story idea in Haroun and the Sea of  Stories.<br />Haroun is the son of a storyteller, a storyteller (the Shah of  Blah) who loses his ability to tell stories when his wife leaves him.  Haroun himself is less impressed with stories questioning their usefulness  when they are not even true.  Accidentally intercepting the genie sent to  shut off his father's story supply, Haroum becomes involved in the rescue  of the ocean of stories.<br />Rushdie tells the tale with a great deal of  humor - the mail bus driver who skips all the mail stops so that Haroun can  see a magnificant view; abbreviations such as P2C2E for processes too  complicated to explain; shadows that have detached from their  substantial-being creating two separate lives, the substantial's and the  shadow's.  The result is an entertaining tale with a great deal of social  and political implied commentary.  Ultimately, however, there is a bit too  much of the cute and clever.  The book is worth reading, certain children  will enjoy it immensely, but in a hundred years it will be known for being  a minor work of Rushdie if Rushdie is still known.	2000-08-19

If you are looking for a translation  which carries the flavor of the original language, these translations are  not for you.  If, however, you are interested in reading poetry that tries  to maintain original images and make them understandable to the Western  mind, then you will find that Barks achieves his goal very well.<br />Like  This contains 43 odes originally translated by John Moyne, a linguist at  CUNY; Coleman Barks has then used in skill in English poetry to make  version of these poems.  What is most evident in his versions is that he  has spent many years with the material and has developed a &quot;sense of  it&quot; without mistaking that &quot;sense of it&quot; with being a Sufi  Master.<br />If you have an interest in Sufi or religious ectastic poetry,  this volume is well worth your time.  If you are a 12th-13th century  Persian scholar they are not.  An example: &quot;There's a tradition that  God can be seen / in the color red.

This explaination shows how his art engaged him in a reflection on  the passage and how his study of the scripture inspired his art.  This is  much along the lines of Jo Milgrom's Handmade Midrash.  For anyone who is  themself interested in calligraphy, for those interested in art as prayer,  or those interested in using art as a means of encouraging bible study this  is an excellent resource.	2000-08-17

Their goal is to provide a translation suitable  for use in liturgy and personal prayer.  This book takes that text and  makes it &quot;user friendly&quot;.  This is done in several ways - clear  type with sufficient white space, simple colored diamond-shape separators  for separating psalm sections, interspering excellent black and white  photographs in keeping with the meditative quality of the Psalms.  The  afterward provides a brief, non-technical introduction to the Psalms, their  liturgical use, and the concerns in translating for liturgical use.<br />This,  together with the companion volume for Canticles is highly reocmmended.	2000-08-17

The translation is the standard ICEL translation (International Commission on English in Liturgy).  What distinguishes this edition of the Canticles is the production - the  use of clear type, adequate open space, excellent black-and-white  meditative photographs.  The result is a volume that is very inviting  (unless you are terrified of anything that doesn't look like prose).  The  volume is intended to be of use both in liturgy and in private prayer.  I  question the use in large liturgical settings - a standard volume of  Morning and Evening Prayer seems mechanically easier although the layout is  intimidating.  Thus in spite of my reservation, I highly recommend this  volume for individuals, small groups and any parish introducing the Liturgy  of the Hours into the parish.	2000-08-17

The author, Mohammed Mrabet, is an oral  storyteller but not necessarily traditional.  I would have appreciated  knowing which, if any, of the stories are traditional.<br />Perhaps the most  powerful story is &quot;What Happened in Granada&quot; which revolves  around the disrespect of the English family running a hotel for the  Moroccan driver of a man who had left his ill wife in their care.  The  story does an excellent job of showing the misunderstandings that can led  to mistreatment.<br />The flip side is &quot;The Woman from New York&quot;  where a Moroccan shows his mistrust of the American woman and the hippies  (I'm assuming based upon the date of the story); their manner of living  causes the Moroccan to consider them sickly, dirty and slanderous.<br />Some  of the stories are humorous.  &quot;Doctor Safi&quot; tells the story of a  man who pulls his donkey's rotten teeth.  From that he concludes he'd do  well with a dental practice (human and animal).  A few successes there and  he fancies himself a doctor.  &quot;The Saint By Accident&quot; follows a  similar humorous path with the misunderstandings on the part of the viewers  not the &quot;saint&quot;.<br />Several stories deal with illness brought on  by sinister powers and cured only by what we would consider religious magic  e.g. &quot;The Well&quot;.  Others are stories of revenge, e.g. &quot;The  Boy Who Set the Fire&quot;.<br />The constants across the stories include a  preference for the older, rural life style; the ever-present kif; conflict  between Muslim and Nazarene.  The book provides an interesting insight into  the culture of the author and, as such, is well worth reading.	2000-08-15

The epic is of a woman wronged by her  husband.  The loss of one breast has mythic implications, tying the  rightful wife to the rain goddess.  Unlike the major epics of North India,  this epic is short and has a straight storyline i.e. none of the  &quot;Baroque&quot; qualities of the Mahabharata, for example.<br />If the  term &quot;epic&quot; puts you off, just consider it a very old love story.  It is simply a lovely story.	2000-08-15

His careful  translation from a definitive text, in as much as India ever produces a  definitive text, is a gift to the person who reads Sanskrit as well as to  those who are dependent upon a translation.  This applies to all published  portions of his translation.  The only disadvantage of this translation is  that after it ends due to Prof. Van Buitenen's death, there is no adequate  translation to finish the epic - only abridgements or translations from the  turn of the (19th)century.<br />Given the propensity of Indian epics to wander  through a variety of stories within stories, I would suggest that someone  with no familarity with the Mahabharata begin either with the Peter Brook's  video - the longest version you can find - or with an abridgement.  It will  help you keep the players and action straight.  However, once you know the  base story there is no substitute for the epic in its own ornate and  convuluted style.  The difference between the abrigements and the real  thing is as extreme as reading a retelling of the Iliad for fourth graders  vs. reading Homer in translation.<br />Even incomplete this readable, accurate  translation is best of class.	2000-08-15

The illustrations are in a Persian style that  well suits the text.<br />The King dies; before he can ascend the throne, the  prince must fight a lion.  Because he is afraid of lions, he flees.  He  enjoys the hospitality of a shepherd until he realizes that he might face  lions.  He enjoys the hospitality of a desert group until he realizes that  he might face lions.  He enjoys the hospitality of a city - where he finds  his bride - only to be faced with lions.  Realizing that there is no  choice, he returns hope to face the lion - a friendly lion unless one fears  him.<br />The story is told by a master storyteller who has the sense to trust  the story; there is no overtly didactic language.	2000-08-14

When the wind sings to her of not always being kind, her  father does not believe the wind can sing; thus, he punishes innocents who  he believed impersonated the wind.  But at last the wind succeeds in  carrying Danina to freedom, to experiencing the world as both good and  bad.<br />This is not a perfect modern fairy tale as the wind on the beach  rescuing her is a bit contrived but it is an excellent story.  The  illustrations enhance the Persian flavor of the tale.  I definately  recommend the book.	2000-08-14

She notes that her life  was one of waiting, that everything other than their meetings became  secondary.  Her honesty forces her to admit that the affair was one of  passion not of love.  After he returned to his native country, she  struggles to rebuild a life that is built on relationships with others, one  built on life in general not passion.  Ernaux is a master at making the  direct details of her experience resonate with the experience of humanity  as a whole.  I recommend this book (or any of her books).	2000-08-13

As usual, Tabucchi is well worth reading but if you  are unfamiliar with him, I'd suggest that you read Letter From Casablanca  first if you prefer short stories or Requiem if you prefer novellas.	2000-08-13

In short,  his was the life of a &quot;common man&quot;, a man unwilling to put on  airs for his daughter but proud of her achievements.  On the otherhand he  was proud of speaking French not the local patois of his parents.  It is  the detail Ernaux chooses that develops a picture of the man: &quot;...but  in front of educated people he would remain quite or would pause in  mid-sentence, adding 'You know what I mean,' with a vague gesture of his  hand, willing the other person to finish the sentence for him.&quot;  A  wonderful book to read to see how a character can come to life on paper.	2000-08-13

The Lord of the  Dance becomes the Mask, the world is created and people live in piece  dancing with the wooden icon of the Mask, then the modern world describes  Mask a &quot;a symbol of ignorance&quot; but the Mask persists.

Only  then will the beginning of this work appropriately shock you: &quot;My  father tried to kill my mother one Sunday in June&quot;.  Her response was  to be ashamed of her background especially as she was enrolled in schools  beyond her social class.  The trip to Lourdes with her father is a  particularly vivid illustration of her relationship with her father that  contrasts with the picture drawn in Positions.  Again Ernaux's direct style  says something universal about social position and what is hidden to  preserve that position.	2000-08-13

The Puranas are the basic source of mythology for Hinduism/South Asia  although the Vedas are a much earlier source. You'll certainly not find the  stories in nice neat packages that retelling of the tales provide but in  the 4 volumes of the translated Brahma Purana, you'll have a nice leisurely  stroll through the myths surrounding Brahma, one of the better known Hindu  deities. The translation is not perfect but the problems translating from  Sanskrit to English is difficult especially when little previous knowledge  of the subject matter can be assumed. The Puranic Encyclopaedia (editted by  Vettam Mani) can certainly be of assistance. Alternatively, reading the  work of Wendy O'Flaherty or John Hawley provides a very readable  introduction to the world view behind the stories.<br />Tho daunting at first,  reading the Puranas quickly becomes addictive - wonderful stories within  stories ... and should you tire of Siva, the series contains about 96 more  volumes to tempt you.	2000-08-13

Mother was a woman of thwarted ambition who hoped to fulfill her  ambition through her daughter.  Ernaux captured well the friction that  arose between them both as a result of the ambition and the resulting class  conflict its fulfillment brought.  In contrast to Positions, Ernaux's  portrayal of her father, this book spends more time on the relationships of  her mother to her husband and daughter.  As in most of Ernaux's work her  ability to use a direct style and very specific details to reflect human  nature as a whole is the prime reaason for reading the book.	2000-08-13

Imagine my amusement, however, that I picked up at the same  time as this volume The Fairy Tales of Hermann Hesse tranlated by Jack  Zipes - and there is no entry for Hesse in the Companion.<br />This volume is  especially strong. however, in that it recognizes the contributions of  composers, artists and film directors and their work to the fairy tale  tradition.  The entries are fascinating and do not require any expertise in  the field.  Items are indexed in a manner that it is easy to find what you  are looking for - &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; is under  &quot;Snow White&quot; - that may seem self-evident but with the number of  varients of fairy tales that is not always so simple.<br />There are longer  articles on the various regions and the general flavor and history of fairy  tales in the region.  These provide a broad overview that is most  useful.<br />Opening at random to give a flavor of the entries: Charles  Kingsley for his The Water-Babies; Rudyard Kipling for Puck of Pook's Hill  and Rewards and Fairies; Sarah Kirsch for her retelling of Grimm tales in  prose and poetry; Kismet the musical; Edward Knatchbull-Hugessen author of  15 children's books; Janusz Korczah for a recent utopian fairy-tale  novel.<br />This book is a significant contribution.  I should hope for a  second edition to close some of the holes. [Of course, I'd like a similar  volume for the rest of the world AND a volume for animal fables ...]	2000-08-13

Priority is written in the form of letters between a young woman and an artist.  The exchange begins as a fan letter, turns into a game, the game  becomes erotic and finally obsessive.  While that slender thread may seem  trite for a plot and the letter ruse overused, in Priority they are both  original and right.  The personalities behind the letters and their &quot;O  too human&quot; nature are absolutely believable as creative &quot;play  mates&quot;.  The letter in which the artist writes of his grandfather who  ran a store and could only paint on Sundays is poignant.  The artist  explaining how scent and color are intertwined in his mind is incredibly  sensual.  The young woman's letters consistently show a creative, poetic,  playful soul who can write eroticism at its imaginary best.  And the  afterward following the final letter confirms the believability of the  whole exchange.<br />The novel is beautifully written, emotionally true and  very perceptive with regards to human nature - and this is the author's  first novel.  This should be added to your must read lisst.	2000-08-12

He initially writes with hesitation, uncertain that the  League still exists, unwilling to break its code of silence, and confused  by the incompleteness of his own memory.  As his writing stalls, he  recognizes the similarity of his problem with that of a survivor of the  World War - how to describe experiences outside the experience of the  normal reader.  He then seeks out an apparent deserter (Leo) from the  quest.<br />Your appreciation for this novel would be enhanced if you (as  opposed to myself) were a strong believer in a long esoteric tradition.  Without such a belief, you will still find yourself intrigued by Hesse's  grasp of human nature.	2000-08-12

The action takes place within a single day - the  action being a dream, an hallucination of the narrator.  The narrator is  introduced as he is annoyed that the person he is to meet has missed their  appointment at 12 noon - only to realize that 12 to a ghost is more likely  midnight.  The person he is to meet is not explicitly identified but is  most likely the poet Pessoa.<br />The narrative then covers the time until the  midnight meeting.  In this time the narrator meets a drug addict in the  park, a seller of lottery tickets, a gypsy who reads his fortune, a dead  friend, a madame of an unsavory hotel, his deceased father, a barkeeper, a  painter of details from the Temptation of St. Anthony, a lighthouse  keeper's wife who is caretaker for a house in which he once lived, a former  lover, a seller of stories, and finally the intended guest.  Along the way  one gathers recipes, literary history, a bit of philosophy ...<br />I highly  recommend this book; it is an excellent text to first encounter Tabucchi.	2000-08-09

This book is one of the more enigmatic of Tabucchi's.  Spino, who works  for a morgue, is a man unwilling to make a commitment to marriage while  enjoying a long-term relationship, a man unwilling to finish his medical  degree and &quot;make something of himself&quot;.  On evening, a young  unidentified body &quot;Carlo Nobodi&quot; is brought to the morgue - the  victim of a police raid / shootout.  Spino becomes obsessed with  identifying the person and traces  Carlo back to his school days without  truly succeeding at putting a person or family behind the name.<br />The  story is part detective story - tracing an identity through a  priest that  befriended Carlo, through the jacket he wore that had been given to his  father (uncle?), through the small boarding school in which Carlo resided,  and through Spino's connections in the seamy underside of the port.  Memory, dreams, death and commitment all wind their way through the  plot.<br />This is another fine book by Tabucchi which forces one to consider  connections, life, death and identity.  I recommend it.	2000-08-05

The latter is also  available from Amazon and has a independent review.<br />As usual, Aliesan's  poetry uses words sparsely and carefully, building sharp images which often  are natural or mythical.  In this volume, she shows herself to be equally  at home with the urban and scientific.<br />The poem she uses as a  &quot;forepiece&quot; well illustrates her style: &quot;when the dark birds  fly over / we stand and wave our arms / no don't come down here / meanwhile  the birds / say look they need us / and we almost flew right  by&quot;.<br />The collection ranges over the shroud of Turin, horse training,  heart arrhythmia, WW II, a history of Ireland, an urban psalm ... through  it all one senses a gentle, socially conscience, spiritual alive poet.<br />If  you enjoy contemporary poetry, Jody Aliesan's work is worth noting.	2000-08-05

Tabucchi sets his tale in India in the form of an unnamed man  trying to find a man, perhaps his brother, who has been missing for about a  year.  His search takes him to a brothel in Bombay, to a Bombay hospital,  to the Theosophical Society in Madras, to the library of a religious order  in Goa ...  Along the way he encounters a dying Jain, a deformed  saddhu/fortune teller, a former Philadelphia mailman, a photographer of  human misery ...  An interesting story, well written, with an unexpected  ending.  A movella well worth your time.	2000-08-05

Pereira is the editor of a cultural page where his work  reflects not what he would wish to write but rather what is acceptable to  write.  He life revolves around his dead wife, food and his dream of  writing a book.  After seeing a piece by Monteiro Rossi, a recent  university graduate in philsophy, he hires Rossi to write a column for the  cultural page.  Rossi is as politically aware and active as Pereira is  blinded and inactive.  The story is of the growing relationship between the  two men and the choices Pereira is forced to make as he starts  participating in life.<br />While the plot is predictable in the sense that  people are predictable, the writing and wit of the novel not only is  entertaining but also forces the reader to consider their own stance  regarding death, religion and politics.<br />This novel is well worth your  time.	2000-08-05

Speijer adds another dimension - syntax - to that training.  To  the best of my knowledge, it is rarely used as a class requirement but  rather is suggested as an optional reference to second or third year  students.  He covers Classical, Vedic and Epic Sanskrit in six sections:  (1) general remarks on the structure of sentences (2) syntax concord and  case relationships (3) classes of nouns and pronouns (4) syntax of verbs  (5) syntax of particles and (6) connection of sentences.<br />A reference well  worth its cost.	2000-08-04

Most of these rhymes will be  unfamiliar as many of them have not previously been published or are less  familiar varients of published rhymes.<br />The illustrations are delightful;  they represent a wide range of illustrators working today.  Some of the  rhymes include dialect which is unobtrusibly &quot;translated&quot;.  Here  and there are notes explaining something about the source of the  rhyme.<br />Examples: &quot;Mrs. Burns' Lullaby&quot; was crooned by Robert  Burn's wife Jean to their children.  &quot;An Indian Giant's Fishing  Tackle&quot; was published in 1653; it is based on a Native American's  tradition of a giant living on Martha's Vinyard.  But the rhymes are not  &quot;exotic&quot; they sound like traditional Mother Goose: &quot;Ginger,  Ginger, broke the winder, / Hit the winder - Crack! / The baker came out to  give 'im a clout / And landed on 'is back&quot;.<br />Absolutely wonderful  book.

These sketches are primarily of childhood as remembered by an adult.  The author has an excellent sense  of detail; however, the sketches show the sensibility of a short-story  author more than of a poet.  The verses have only a loose relationship to  the sketch they accompany.  Unfortunately most of them are mediocre e.g.  &quot;My bits of grief hide themselves / in the depths of my soul. / They  are so numerous, so small, / they hardly bother me.&quot;  Here and there  one finds a delight &quot;The rain prayed/ its prayer of dawn&quot; /  shelling / the tiny beads / from the white rosary. / And I gathered them up  / in my hands, / and also prayer / with the rain / my prayer of dawn.&quot;  But even these enjoyable gems are at best semi-precious stones.<br />This is  worth reading to improve your Spanish as it is reasonably easy reading.  It  is worth reading if you are interested in the generation of 1927.  It's  worth reading if you are interested in poetry written by Spanish females.  Otherwise, it's a matter of taste.  It is clear that the translator likes  the poetry more than I; you may too.	2000-08-02

(A lectionary contains the  Biblical readings for a given Sunday).<br />This series of three volumes for  the three year lectionary cycle (each year concentrates on a synoptic  Gospel - Matthew, Mark or Luke) contains music, poetry, art, etc. that in  some way reflect on the Scripture for a given Sunday.  The volumes are  carefully multicultural.<br />An example: for the first Sunday in Advent,  there are photos by Paul Chesley, David Austen and Dennis Oda;excerpts from  Robert A. Raines and Jospeh Wood Krutch; poetry by Dom Helder Camara and  Thomas John Carlisle; and a detail from art by Naul Ojeda.<br />Each Sunday is  equally diverse.

Parenti has  selected from this document prayers for the liturgical hours (Divine  Office, Breviary).  The prayers are clearly saturated with a Scriptural  orientation - phrases and images consistently taken from the Bible.

The book itself is organized by Indo-European roots.  Shipley does  not, however, expect you to know the IE root of an English word off the top  of your head - he does provide an English to root index.<br />Tidbits of  information come from an amazingly broad range of topics.  For example,  speaking of the root plumbum (lead) he mentions that it may come via Iberia  because lead was mined in Spain as early as 2000 BC.  In the entry on men  (for math etc.) we get a quote from Dryden on Bacchus.  In short, you get  the information you need (the etmology and history of a word) along with  fun tidbits.<br />The only complaint is that the dictionary is too fun ...  looking up a word will always turn into an hour long browsing for  enjoyment.	2000-07-30

What Camus has achieved is essentially a narrative philosophy  (parallel to narrative theology) in which a philosophy is presented in the  form of a life story.  Whether or not that life story is true, the reader  is left to determine.<br />The crux of the story is an incident which  shattered the narrator's self-image - the suicide of a young woman by  jumping off a bridge where he did nothing to save her.  He tells of his  worldly success before the incident and the shock of understanding the  motives which were behind his success ... slef-knowledge he found difficult  to accept.<br />Because Camus has successfully written a philosophical  narrative one follows the story and is forced to consider the motivations  in ones own life.  One need not accept Camus' analysis to be deeply  affected by this novel.	2000-07-30

This book is definately literature not formula mystery.<br />The story is set in a Latin  American city during an uprising.  A group of men who've known each other  for years meet for a dinner party.  The host's relationship with his  housekeeper, the Senora Puccini of the title, is dominating and cruel.  In  the course of the evening his degradation of her becomes more and more  cruel as more of the story behind the relationship becomes known - a story  of passion, jealousy, love and fidelity.  The final revelations are both  surprising and believable.<br />This is an excellent book - a story told so  well that you want to read it over and over - a story so disturbing that is  forces you to consider man's cruelity to man.	2000-07-30

I have recently read Duras' No More and Ernaux's I Remain in Darkness (both of which I recommend) so when I saw A Very Easy Death I picked it up to read as another take on death.  I was disappointed.<br />Beauvoir writes  well - it is sheer pleasure to read some of the descriptive passages where  she selects just the right details to set the physical and emotional  scenes.  Her self-revelation of her surprise at her emotions is often  poignent.<br />However, two aspects of the book disturb me.  First, Beauvoir  writes as if she knew well what her mother was thinking and assumes that  the deception of her Mother worked.  Given the number of death images in  the mother's dreams and given her gradual detachment from the external  world, I suspect that her mother knew she was dying but did not wish to  confront her daughters regarding the deception.  Beauvoir writes touchingly  of the long standing riff between she and her mother - their lack of mutual  understanding - then asks me to trust her interpretation of her mother's  frame of mind in her last days.  A bit more of a stretch than I care to  grant.<br />The second aspect of the book that disturbs me is the ease with  which Beauvoir slots particular events into general intellectual  categories.  For example, when the doctor's exhibit a bad bedside manner,  she writes &quot;I bristled when the privileged classes spoke ...&quot;.<br />The book is an interesting reflection on the perceptions and  self-examination of the author.  It could well be comforting to others  going through similar situations.  Read it if it appeals, but don't put on  any must read list.	2000-07-29

The opposition of  Prevert to war and religion is highly visible but generally not strident.  Prevert's use of repetition, the ordinariness of his observations create a  very accessible poetry.<br />As an example &quot;Flowers and Wreathes&quot;  explores thought in the image of flower, the pull of beauty and pleasure  over reality etc.  The poem ends with the following use of repetition:  &quot;Because / In their head / Sprouts the sacred flower / The thin little  filthy flower / The sick flower / The bitter flower ...&quot;	2000-07-27

The challenges of  censored mail, time disconnects (e.g. cafe closed when filming is supposed  occuring), of ill-tempered fasters during Ramadan, and business concerns  (copyrights, translators, contracts ...) make for interesting observations  in the hand of Paul Bowles.

These persona, together with their younger self, reflect the  range within which the poetry roams - depending heavily on mythic images,  condensed language, and a solid sense of verbal rhythm.	2000-07-27

The composition of the photographs is excellent.<br />Photos of  particular interest to me: The Church of Santa Maria in Jolalpan with its  very brightly painted exterior, the Day of the Dead colorful skeletons, the  very ornate Chapel of the Rosary in Puebla, the vine/saint motif in the  Church of Santa Domingo in Oaxaca.<br />If you are interested in folk religion  or religious architecture, this volume is recommended.	2000-07-27

The book consists of a series of short pieces - some character sketches, some short  stories, etc. - revolving around Senora Rodriguez and her family.<br />Senora  Rodriguez carries her life in her purse; digs into the purse contents is a  unifying theme in the book.  This humorous theme is then played with as  when the Senora accidently  switches her purse with that of an aunt living  in Paris.<br />Although the book is written with a light touch, there are  several pieces that carry strong messages.  The issue of dolls setting a  standard of beutiful women being blond and blue eyed when the environment  is dark haired and brown eyed is explored in two or three pieces.  The  issue of extramartial sex is delightfully explored in the relationship of a  secretary to the boss's wife and children.  Ecology / exploitation is  explored in a humorous sketch of communal net fishing.<br />The negative  aspects of religion are explored in the mother-in-law's belief that her  married son should remain a virgin - the wife's deceits are delightful.  Sketches of the stranger voluntarily going to death and the betrayed  traitor's suicide are retellings of Christ's way of the cross and Judas  Iscariot's betrayal.<br />In short, the sketches cover a full life breadth of  Mexican life forming an unusual novel which is well worth your time to  read.	2000-07-25

Bryce feels comfortable  asserting that early Christianity was estoteric (the Gnostic Christianity  was), asserting that Hindu worldviews are imbedded in the Celtic symbolism  (they are both IndoEuropean there could be a connection), and otherwise  assuming that &quot;universal&quot; can be assumed - it doesn't require  proof.  By the end, I was unwilling to trust anything the author wrote  beyond the dates, locations and other basis information associated with the  crosses.  On too many points I wanted to steer him to reliable sources such  as Pelikan on the history of images of Christ to modify his over  simplification.<br />Nonetheless, the book is worth its cost for the  illustrations - and some of what the author writes is useful.	2000-07-21

They include character sketches, experimental literature, humor, groups of aphorisms ... all done  with great wit and excellent writing.  The translation is very readable;  there is no sense of reading foreign syntax.<br />Examples of pieces in the  book: &quot;First Aid&quot; is a short story in which the inepitude of the  civil service/nobility kills a drunk &quot;drowning&quot; victim through  folk medicine (tossing on a rug) and vague &quot;CPR&quot;  instructions.<br />&quot;From the Diary of an Assistant Bookkeeper&quot; is a  tale of perpetual hope of promotion based on the demise of the current  bookkeeper given in the form of a diary.<br />&quot;Questions Posed by a Mad  Mathematician&quot; presents the worst fears for a mathmatics test.

Which of my legs was bitten, the right or the  left?&quot;<br />&quot;Confession - or Olya, Zhenya, Zoya: A Letter&quot; is a  bachelor's explanation of why he has never married - the disasters (from  hiccups up) that have foiled each proposal.<br />The remaining pieces are as  diverse and entertaining.

I am curious if the author titled this book &quot;The Eighth Day&quot; based on the Catholic/Christian reference to Sunday as the eighth day, the  day of recreation.  Be that as it may, the book has many merits - e.g. the  way it makes the oppressive atmosphere tangible &quot;only with difficulty  could she get the damp air into her lungs&quot;.  The atmosphere is filled  with disappointment, drunkeness, violence, self-pity and self-loathing.  A  few pages into the novel, I fully expected it to be good, maybe very  good.<br />Unfortunately, as the main character Agnieszka breaks in her own  way, the plot fails ... there has not been sufficient psychological change  to motivate the change in behavior.<br />As an anti-Communist piece of Polish  literature, the book is interesting; as a universal piece of humanity under  repression it fails.

Watson's strength is the realism and complexity he builds into his  characters.  His is the genteel gritty of small town people, the clouded  introspection of the flawed.  In this case a sheriff and the high school  principal are the core of failure - where the attempt of the sheriff to  protect the reputation of the principal (after the principal and a female  student are killed in a car crash) leads deeper and deeper into deception  that threatens the sheriff's marriage and self-image.<br />It is probably not  fair for me to consider Watson a quick, light read - that implies more  fixed genre/pulp writing than Watson provides - but I don't want to imply  that he belongs with the Hesse, Calvino, Scliar level.<br />Why do I tag this  his poorest effort?  Merely because the plot is more contrived than in his  other works.	2000-07-19

This book differs only in that the narrator is a teacher rather than a sheriff.  Watson's strength is the complexity and authenticity of his characters - less true in this  novel than Montana 1948 or White Crosses. The plot is well constructed - a  serial killer in a high school.  However, Watson does not write a  traditional mystery - he is concerned with whodunit but more interested in  exploring the effect of serial killings on the community - making and  breaking relationships, suspicions of any &quot;other&quot;, fear of the  next death.<br />Well written and entertaining - curl up and read for fun.	2000-07-19

The prayers cover morning, midday, evening  and night prayer and are based on traditional themes, psalms, scripture and  prayers.  The prayers are Celtic prayers - in contrast to the Latin prayer  formats of the official text.  What sets this volume apart is the use of  litanies - in lieu of hymns and canticles.  The result is a very effective  communal prayer book - which encourages truly participation.  However, the  use of litanies makes its use as a solitary prayer less powerful.

In writing the internal  dialogues, and yes they are dia- or trialogues not monologues, Mamet shows  his skill as a playwright - playwrights must tell their tale through the  speech of the cast.<br />However, in the early chapters of the book it is  sometimes difficult to determine who is speaking.  And Frank's social  relationships come across as one-dimensional as Mamet focuses on the  relationships necessary to explain this miscarriage of justice.<br />The novel  is good enough to recommend to individuals interested in prejudice,  miscarriages of justuce etc. - but it doesn't deserve an unqualified  recommendation.	2000-07-18

Nonetheless there are other  memorable poems e.g. &quot;Knot&quot; a meditation on dying.  But, in  general, the collection is another American rural / academic volume of  competent poetry - worth your time but no more worth your time than  hundreds of similar volumes.	2000-07-15

Jabes is an Egyptian Jew in exile in France writing primarily after the Holocaust.  His writing  style is a series of snippets - fiction, poetry, aphorisms - that explore  the limits of language and the role of the blank, the silence, the desert,  the unwritten.  In The Books of Shares each of these snippets stands on its  own - that is not true, for example, of the multi-volume Book of Questions.  The result is a truly post-modern reflection on theology and philosophy -  and post-modern without pretention.<br />When I read this book on a silent  retreat, I found passage after passage that I wanted to hear, to memorize,  to enter into my journal.<br />An example: &quot;Out of the words of his  language, a writer forges new words, not neologisms, but words irrigated  with his blood.  He founds a second language which, to be sure, is rooted  in the first with all its fibers, but which henceforth, being his own - O  paradox - is nobody's.  Because the writer's language wants to be only of  the book, of the instant and duration of a liberated word.&quot;<br />If you  enjoy the Books of Shares, there are many wonderful volumes of Jabes to  follow.  If you do not enjoy this, you may safely assume that Jabes is not  your reading choice.	2000-07-15

These short stories are far more conventional than her novels  e.g. Body in Four Parts.  Her characters, however, are already strong  females - in this case rural females - who love and loose.  The plots of  the stories are common but the voice of the author, the characters she  builds already show the strength apparent in her later works.	2000-07-15

The fact that I would award Moacyr Scliar a Nobel Prize for  literature in itself explains why 400 pages of his short stories is just  right.<br />Scliar is a versatile author - Jewish and Brazilean - with a  breadth of knowledge of history, medicine, psychology, anthropology and  Hebrew scripture that both root his stories in the concrete and give them a  universal understanding. He is comfortable in allegory, fantasy, magical  realism.<br />All the traits of his better known novels - The Strange Nation  of Rafael Mendes and Centaur in the Garden - are here in minature.<br />Given  my interests, I particularly enjoyed the retelling of the ten plagues of  Egypt from the perspective not of the Hebrews but of the Egyptians.  However, were I to list all my favorites and explain why I'd exceed the  Amazon word limit!<br />If you aren't up to this thick volume, read Centaur in  the Garden ... then you'll want 400 pages more of his masterful writing.	2000-07-14

The Uncle is a Texas dreamer of the best kind -  always sure that his next game plan will make him rich - this time it's  wild horses - while always going bankrupt.  This time the game plan  includes his nephew tagging along.<br />This is not great literature in the  sense that it will be read 500 years from now.  But it is great fun worth  rereading.	2000-07-14

They are accompanied by drawings by Norman Lalibene who has captured the spirits of the stories.  The stength  of this book is that it has kept an oral flavor and oral structure while  being sufficiently literary to make the stories easy to read and enjoyable  - this is not an easy feat.<br />In the tales you will see a card-shark  outwitted, a man unwilling to make a decision,a duck handler mistrusting a  witch, bargains with ghosts ... in short, bits of Caribbean life.<br />If you  enjoy folk tales, give this volume a chance.	2000-07-14

The Doberman of the title both is and isn't; is frendly, protective, sadistic  leading one ever closer to understanding the phobias of the unnamed  narrator.<br />Unfortunately, from my perspective, as the Dobermans take over,  the writer (not the narrator) looses control and a novel with great promise  goes plop!<br />I will perhaps try another piece by the author as there was  much promise.  I understand why some will enjoy (and defend) this book.  But with so many books to read and so little time to read them, I can't  recommend this.	2000-07-14

Seriously, three things made me pick up this book when I had no notion of who E.M. Cioran was.  First, the beautiful cover with a detail from &quot;The Descent from the Cross&quot;; second, the intriguing title; and  third the quote from the Chicago Tribune printed on the back: &quot;makes  the postwar French Existentialists look like a 6th-grade meeting of the  Future Bores of America&quot;.  I enjoy the French Existentialists - I had  to see what was up with Cioran.<br />What is up with Cioran?  He is absolutely  top-notch: searching for the origin of tears in the lives of female saints  known for copious tears ... from them he build a case against theology and  institution and for intuition and sentiment ... all the while being highly  political (Romanian politics).<br />The book pieces itself together in a  series of small clips.  An example: &quot;Schopenhaurer maintains that, if  we were to invite the dead back to life, they would refuse.  I believe, on  the contrary, that they would die a second time from too much  joy.&quot;<br />An enthralling, thought-provoking book to be savored.  And you  can still enjoy the French existentialists.	2000-07-14

I picked up this slim volume because it (a) was slim and (b) appeared from the cover that it might provide insight into the mind of Soseki Natsume whose work I was about to try.  Hence, until I've actually read some more  substantial works, I feel unqualified to review this piece.<br />The Tower of  London consists of three parts: 1) an introduction to the history of the  translation and the history of the Tower of London by Peter Milward 2)  Soseki Natsume's fictionalized essay on his visit to the Tower and 3) Kii  Nakano's commentary on the piece with regards to writing style etc.<br />As a  piece to understand the workings of the author's mind, this is well worth  reading - the interplay between fantasy and &quot;reality&quot; is very  telling.  This particular characteristic is used successfully and  unsuccessfully (the maudlin scene of the mother).  The highlights of the  history of the London Tower selected for the flights of imagination are  also telling ... to some extent reflecting his Shakespearan studies. All in  all well worth having read but I wouldn't put it high on a &quot;must read  list&quot; ... more like a backwater eddy to read if the whim stricks.	2000-07-13

Galvin has done a superb job of taking the concrete details of life on a Western ranch and made of them a universal exploration of  history, human surviving, practical theology.  Poem after poem allows  reading and rereading without exhausting the poem's potential.<br />Opening at  random - &quot;The sound of me getting norwhere. / Though I'm telling you  there are mountains so distant / It hurts to look&quot; - what a wonderful  image &quot;so distant it hurts&quot; - over and over these concrete,  straight-talking Western poems catch you up in a new way of looking at the  world - new questions, new potential answers.	2000-07-12

The &quot;work&quot; of existence in this novel is digging sand - generally digging sand at the same rate nature  blows it in.  It is this role of &quot;nature&quot; which leads me to a  more mythic view of the book than I would have, for example, for Kafka's  work.<br />The strength of the story comes from the tracing the change of  values, the psychological evolution in the single, teacher/amateur insect  collector - both the changes in himself and the changes in his  understanding of the villagers with whom/by whom he is trapped.<br />Only once  in the novel did I feel for a page or two that the author was telling us of  the  psychological changes rather than showing us.  For a book of this  complexity where the mind-set of the characters is crucial to the novel  plot, this is an amazing feat.<br />Well written, thought-provoking, an  enjoyable read - what more would I ask for?	2000-07-12

Yet Lynch writes poetry with universal meaning - accessible to those neither Catholic, Midwestern  nor small town.  Like many similar works, it plays off &quot;Catholic  guilt&quot;; unlike some works it truly &quot;plays&quot; - it has a sense  of humor regarding youthful understandings and preoccupations while  recognizing that the youth is the basis for the adult understanding.<br />An  especially touching piece is &quot;The Moveen Notebook&quot; - based on  family history and the inheritence of the &quot;home place&quot; in  Ireland.  It begins: &quot;When I first came, the old dog barked me back, /  all fang and bristle and feigned attack.&quot; The strength of the poem is  in it masterful use of the ordinary - but what an enjoyable  &quot;ordinary&quot; to read.	2000-07-12

On the other hand, many will enjoy it so I'd like it to be better known.<br />Tbe book is a series of short-short stories, in which the  Moon is a major character and gay bars are a common location.  Part of my  reservation regarding the book is that in some ways Taruho seems to be  trying to write French surrealism in the sense of a youthful writer who has  yet to hit his stride.  On the other hand, what wonderful Japanese-French  surrealism and how hopeful the author in the rise of machines and  science.<br />Some of the tales are simply three or 4 sentences - yet in  context they carry their share of meaning and atmosphere.  The images are  very well used - images from the mundane to the highly creative.<br />A very  short excerpt to give a flavor of the writing: &quot;When I stepped from  the garden into the room the air was thick with purple smoke The lights  were clouded over  I sat down on the door that had been blown off and for a  long while I was lost in thought.&quot;<br />If you enjoy experimental  literature, give this a try.

Nothing about them set them apart from the general heap of grimy, lyrical,  contemporary poetry.  Nothing made them universal.<br />However, the last  section of the book breaks forth with several excellent poems - the title  poem &quot;The Origins of Evening&quot; is an exploration of death written  for the author's uncle.  &quot;The Closet&quot; is a delightful piece of  letting one's life trap you ...<br />If your background resonates with the  Pittsburgh steel mill environment, some of the earlier poems may speak to  you.

The diary of the period just  before his grandfather's death is moving but I am uncertain that his  appended notes add anything.<br />Of the autobiographical section, Oil is the  best piece.  In his learning that his hatred for oil had its origins in his  father's funeral - a father of whom he had no memories - is a telling piece  about the human mind in general.  This piece alone is worth the cost of the  book.<br />The second section has a variety of his early short-short stories  bounded together, seemingly, only by when they were written and when they  were published.  The most interesting of these are the retelling of  folktales - either directly or by writting a story that plays off one.  The  two tales I find most satisfying in this section are The Princess of Dragon  Palace which is straight myth and The Money Road which is a setting of a  folktale in contemporary times.<br />A number of other stories are very well  done and could easily be the one that speaks best to you.	2000-07-09

This book also has a  few comments attached to some poems to place them in the life of Ryokan.  The net result is a translation that makes it more apparent Ryokan's  religious content than the other excellent translations.

As such, this is a book you read for what you can learn rather  than for literary pleasure.<br />Nonetheless, it is enjoyable reading for  someone (like myself) with no particular interest in the region or the time  nor interest in female literature solely for the gender of the  author.<br />The most surprising piece is a poem written by a woman to a  woman.  One of the more interesting to me, is a poem which straddles the  troubador and religious traditions.	2000-07-07

This is a remarkable book that forces one to recognize the horrors humanity is able to inflict on fellow humans - and because of the concreteness, the personalization of the torture, there is no way to escape the message of the book. It should haunt you for years and demand action even though all action seems inadequate.	2000-07-07

His writing is good but not great.  However, this is an unusual &quot;religious quest&quot; novel both in the youth and in the failure of the religious  seeker.  It provides insights into North African Islamic culture,  especially as observed by a religious misfit.<br />This volume is well worth  your time.	2000-07-07

Why?  Because they both tell stories based on visual description.  The traits they have in  common, the points at which they diverge are a fascinating comparison.<br />I  don't mean to imply you must have read Nadas to enjoy Robbe-Grillet.  Robbe-Grillet is very consistent in his objective observer technique - the  senses which are most subjective - taste, smell and touch are all but  absent in Snapshots.  Some of the shapshots such as The Dressmaker's Dummy  tend to require mental gymnastics to visualize the scene precisely as  described.  Others such as The Way Back are easier to visualize and provide  an implied plot line.<br />This short book is well worth the time to read -  either for enjoyment or for a reminder of what was avante-garde 50 years  ago.	2000-07-06

I'm never sure how to respond to experimental found text books.  They are interesting as an exercise - especially to observe one's response to texts out of their context.  However, rarely do they work as literature in their  own right - at least in the sense of being of interest in 500 years.  When  they work, I still consider them emphemeral.<br />99: The New Meaning is not  an exception.  The provision of the number of words in each extract appears  to add no value other than insuring the reader correctly identify when the  extracted text begins.  In this particular case, I found myself  uncomfortable with the European-centric text; in some manner, it caused me  to read the text as an &quot;inside literati&quot; text.<br />In short, the  text is worth reading as experimental text but not particularly a original  experiment.	2000-07-06

Marianne Moore created her own net - her poetry is built upon strict syllabic counts she  imposed upon herself.  The result is finely crafted poetry that is never  self-indulgent.<br />I have found her syllabic count to be a good way to  introduce structure into student's poetry.  I have found it to be a good  writing exercise.  And in using the structure in these ways, I have become  ever more impressed with the quality of work she achieved.  But more than  the technical quality, I enjoy the humor and just plain fun of her animal  poems.	2000-07-06

A wonderful section is devoted to poetic ideas that he has never written which he offers as potential ideas  for those who are younger.  Unlike many who espouse religion, he is very  open regarding sexual desires and as such he appears to be a whole and  genuine person not a literary front.  As for the quality of his poetry and  prose, there is a reason he was awarded a Nobel Prize for Literature - this  book confirms the appropriateness of that award.	2000-07-05

While is it specifically a satire on the USSR under communism, it also is a satire on human nature.  Therefore, the book remains a gem after the failure of communism and the  breakup of the USSR.  The satire is built on an interplay of the  distinctions (if any) between man and dog - and the dangers of being so  self-confident as to blur that line.  While satire often does not bear  rereading, this book is well-structured and well-written - a favorite to  return to.	2000-07-05

This book is no exception.  However, this is a book that reads as if it were crafted rather than grown out of the characters.  Willie, as a  homeless, mentally ill individual, is developed as a realistic character  avoiding many of the cliches that are ascribed to such a character.  However, none of the characters Mr. Bones meets after Willie's death are  more than cardboard characters.<br />As for Mr. Bones himself, each reader  will have a private opinion as to how well the dog is portrayed - an  opinion based on the reader's presuppositions about dogs.  That is to say  that the author does not develop Mr. Bones in a manner to cause the reader  to suspend disbelief if the portrayal is significantly different from the  reader's opinions on dogs.<br />Nevertheless, the book is an enjoyable read -  and a reasonable reread - especially for dog lovers.  But if you've not  read Paul Auster before, this is not the book on which you should judge the  quality of his work.	2000-07-04

It is written with the realism that one associates with Ernaux or Duras.  As the author says in an interview at the end of the book:  &quot;We were completely  attuned to the exterior world ... We had a real need for precision, with  some belief that if we could put on paper precisely what was in the outside  owrld that, in itself, would convey the emotional potential indispensable  to poetry.&quot;<br />Thus this book makes its points simply - the cigarette  wrapped in a death certificate, the recognition of the enemy in the same  sweater that you wear,  the pear eaten with the iman of the mosque ... the  result is a book that will not permit you to view war in the abstract but  rather forces you to look at war in the eyes of individual people who  matter.	2000-07-02

It explores the relationship between a couple on a cruise ship vacation  following the marriage of their daughter - an only child.  While that  description may not make the book sound interesting, the book is excellent  - it has a tightly written plot with unusual relationships between its  characters and with surprising twists that provide the insights into the  characters' personalities that hold the story together.<br />However, if  you've read nothing by Montero, I would suggest either of her other  translated books - In the Palm of Darkness or The Messager - as more  indicative of her style.	2000-07-01

In this collection, however, the author has shown herself willing to experiment with a variety of styles, willing to stretch  herself.<br />Several of the stories are memorable - An Obscure Geography and  I Am Telling You Lies - are examples.  An Obscure Geography is set in the  eighth grade in a poor rural community; the author captures some of the  more obscure nature of the students.  I Am Telling You Lies reveals how a  Latin American student deals with his family expectations and his physical  appearance.<br />Two of the stories are &quot;short shorts&quot; - Fog misses  the mark for this form while Chairman of the Board succeeds.<br />All in all  this collection is worth reading. Di Blasi is an author worth watching.  I  await the day this is labeled one of her &quot;lesser&quot; works for she  has proven herself to be very talented.	2000-07-01

It was quickly followed by everything I could find by him.  Bioy-Casares collaborated with the better known Jorge Luis Borges - and the inventive  prose shows that there is an affinity of genius.<br />This particular tale is  a study on prisons - guards and prisoners - and the horrors that grow out  of the relationship between the enprisoning and the enprisoned.  If you  want a straight line plot with everything neatly bundled at the end, this  book is not for you.  If you are willing to risk contemplating humanities'  capacity for evil, you will be enthralled by this master.	2000-06-26

There is a nice variety of natural and supernatural ... pure evil, revenge, just rewards, trees,  ships, blobs, cemetaries.  Enough variety that you can select a story that  is just scarey enough - but not too scary.  Only a couple of the tales fall  at bit flat.  All in all I recommend it.	2000-06-26

They come together in a small ocean inn run by fay children.  At  the center of the book stands a horrofic story of humanity at its worst.  .  . .<br />The structure of the book is a difficult one but one Baricco has  fashioned into the absolutely correct form for his story.  The prose ranges  from very lush, descriptive prose to very taciturn conversation, from art  catalogue entries to poetic prayers.  Occasionally a sentence or two will  misfire, but Baricco has exquisite control over his medium.<br />This book  belongs on any must read list.	2000-06-25

It builds appreciation for the Psalms by identifying common threads of human experiences that are found in the Psalms - e.g. reversal of fortune, anger, abandonment etc. It suggests ways to deal with the violent revenge themes of the Psalms that we find difficult to reconcile with our image of God ...<br />Unfortunately, the book is ultimately dissatisfying. While large portions of the Psalms are quoted, with a few exceptions, only small bits are actually discussed in the text. And of the human situations described in the Psalms only a handful of archtypes are discussed.<br />Therefore, I find the book interesting as a way to see the Psalms through the eyes of another or as a pointer towards an interesting classification of Psalms based on the human situation calling forth the Psalm ... but I would not recommend it as a place to start for gaining appreciation of the Psalms.	2000-06-25

Rather, this is poetry of a Zen monk who retained the  playfulness of a child and who is reticent regarding his enlightenment.  In  fact, you may read far into the book before encountering poems that are  unambiguously &quot;Zen&quot;.<br />What truly sets this edition apart,  however, is the afterward which includes memories of individuals who knew  Ryokan.  Even if the translation was mediocre, I would recommend the book  for this alone.  Luckily, the translation is satisfactory though not  inspired.<br />The poems themselves were written in Japanese and Chinese - in  form, they are varied - as there is so much wonderful Zen haiku translated  into English, this volume is a delightful counterpoint of other poetic  forms.	2000-06-24

If insights such as that excite you, you will  enjoy this book.<br />The book is written in a very personal style - how  Dorothy C. Bass has come to see and use time.  This results occassionally  in some reader disconnects e.g. her assumption that a church could not  refrain from Christmas carols during Advent - I come from a church that  does not use Christmas carols until the Christmas vigil.  But these  &quot;disconnects&quot; also are a strength for the book - she is not  giving you a list of how-to's, but rather inviting you to reevaluate time  in your life ... with a recognition that that will have similarities and  differences from what it means in her life.<br />This book is recommended for  everyone - and especially needed by individuals planning liturgical season.	2000-06-24

Especially interesting is  the segment on the relationship between homilectics and music.<br />The music  explored ranges from chant to 20th century - the latter more by reference  than by analysis.  It includes instrumental music and cantatas as well as  the classic music of the Mass.<br />One need not be a musician nor a  liturgical historian to understand this book.  But reading the book will  help a liturgist understand the liturgical musician and the historical  development of their role.<br />Highly recommended for anyone involved in  liturgical planning.	2000-06-24

As the poetic structure of the original Korean would not work in English, they established a new English form into  which they translated the Korean.  The result is spectacular - one retains  the sense of the poetic discipline in the Korean while never feeling that  the English is forced.  (If you have suffered through bad translations of  Sanskrit poetry into English quartrains you know exactly what this poetry  doesn't do.)<br />The introduction to the poetry - essentially court courtesan  poetry - sets the cultural stage for the poetry.  It's lack of  &quot;status&quot; helps explain how &quot;only the best survived&quot; -  and it is an excellent best.  The poetry stands so well on its own, I am  tempted to suggest you read the introduction after you have enjoyed the  poetry.	2000-06-24

As Buddhism is agnostic while Christianity believes in a personal God with  whom one enters into a personal relationship.  I can cite the influence of  Nestorian Christianity on Chan Buddhism or the influence of monotheist  Islam on Tibetan Buddhism and I still can't make the leap the author  does.<br />The overemphasis, from my perspective, of the individual prayer and  minimized reference to corporate prayer also clashes with my view of  Christians composing the Body of Christ.<br />On the positive side, some of  her examples drawn from her role as spiritual director and her interest in  playful prayer speaks of a woman of spiritual depth.

The volumes reflect what the Northumbria Community has found  works for them - and coming out of actual practice means that it is  designed to meet the actual needs of the community.<br />Some may object to  the recasting of Shabbat in Christian terms - several dioceses have dropped  Passover meals because of potential offense to our Jewish community.  Many  will find that some of the readings for meditation are excellent and some  will soon be forgotten.  The mediations come from a variety of religious  traditions e.g. for February we have: Brother Lawrence, Michel Quoist,  Marjorie Milne, Ian Petit, Catherine Baird, Madelaine L'Engle ...  In both  books scripture reading constitutes a significant portion of the  prayer.<br />If the psalms of Morning and Evening Prayer don't speak to you,  this is a solid prayer book that may lead you to other forms of the Liturgy  of the Hours.	2000-06-16

I appreciated the  time range of the book as it covers both the conquest of the Eastern Church  by Islam (sending Eastern Christians fleeing to the West) and the split  between the Orthodox and Catholic Churches.  The description /  interpretation of the narrative scenes is sufficiently detailed to teach a  neophyte how to recognize the event being portrayed.  After the world tour  of art from Assisi, the section on Assisi gained clarity as I had actually  seen art from a church discussed. I would have preferred more colored  plates and could have done without some of the detail of the computer work  supporting the book.  But the latter may be important to the intended  audience.	2000-06-14

Interspered between the narrative segments are quotations from a wide variety of literary sources.  In the narrative  segments, especially those of the mother, dreams and &quot;reality&quot;  are intertwined.  The book deserves multiple readings to fully appreciate  its content but is certainly enjoyable as a single read.<br />Note: since  there is no description of the book this is translated from Hungarian and  is part of a larger work.	2000-06-13

The prose describing the encounters and the selection of details to include in the description is masterful - in a slim  volume one gains both a feeling of Morocco's bureaucrats, of the author's  respect for Genet and of Genet himself.  There is no hint of &quot;gossip  column&quot; or &quot;me with a big shot&quot;  - both of which are dangers  for this type of writing.  This is book is well worth your time.	2000-06-13

However, if you have some familarity with the  tradition, you'll find this book fascinating - this is more recent (18th  century) and closer to the tribal origins of the worship of  Kali/Uma/Pavarti/Gauri/Tara.  These poems are popular in the sense that  they have been kept alive through oral transmission rather than written  manuscripts.  One poem with a surprising rural flavor stands out:  &quot;.../My body is Tara's field/ in which the God of Gods/ like a good  farmer / sows his seed with a great mantra. / Around this body, faith / is  set like a fence / with patience for posts ...&quot;	2000-06-11

It is good, it is enjoyable -  and you can read volumes without noting a change in author and without  encountering a single memoriable verse.  Much of this volume strikes me as  &quot;academic verse&quot;.<br />However, there are a handful of wonderful  poems in which a unique voice of the poet comes forth.  &quot;Recipe&quot;  inspired by a recipe for cooking terrapin is one such example. &quot;Long  Like a River&quot; - a reverie on a dead dog is another.  Many of the New  Orleans poems imply we are reading the first book of a poet whose talents  are considerable.	2000-06-10

The book includes a comprehesive introduction to nativity scenes then  highlights 17 artists from 10 tribes/pueblos.  The book is trilingual -  German, Spanish and English so there is less text than the book size would  imply.<br />The choice of Nacimientos to show is excellent - a very wide range  all of excellent quality.  Examples: Figures dressed as plains Indians,  unadorned clay figures, Pueblo Indians etc.  Details are well described so  that mesquite wood, ollas, jugs etc. are not ignored.  The collection also  includes a single piece nativity set made by an unknown child.  Excellent  book.	2000-06-10

This book does a very good job of showing (rather than desscribing) the actions and provides the words and music.  As it is folklore, you will find some of the fingerplays or action rhymes from your  childhood as well as new additions to your repetoire.  As I have come to  expect, I believe that the publishing company has underestimated the age  range for which the book is appropriate ... listen to your young friends  after their first camping trip with the cub scouts, bluebirds etc. and you  will find that even at that ages children are teaching children some of  these plays.	2000-06-10

The only narrative dislocation this caused was  that it took me some time to place the story in time sufficiently to give  the action context and social context is essential to following the story.  I enjoyed the book - will probably reread it - but at the end of the book,  I still cared nothing about the characters - this may be intentional on the  part of the author as it is consistent with the photographer's inability to  deal with the world outside the photograph of it.	2000-06-10

As such, it is an interesting way to initiate cross-generational discussions - jump-rope rhymes are school yard folklore  with astounding staying power.

It is an excellent  training aid - it should be required for liturgy commissions and pastoral  councils.  It could also be used effectively in the training of liturgical  ministers or for small study groups within a parish.  An excellent  resource.	2000-06-09

His poetry is very multicultural - Siberian, Ancient Egyptian, Bedoin ... and draws from music, religious practices, myths ...  as such is is demanding of a reader.  The poetry has a rhythm very skillfully controlled by the poet - sometimes  traditional, sometimes natural, and at times very delibrately jarring.  Repetition is another poetic tool he uses skillfully and subtly.  The poems  are closely interwined - many being parts of series of poem - giving the  collection a sense of wholeness often missing in poet's booksized  publications - so intertwined I was surprised at the quantity of prior  publications of the poems.<br />The subject matter is frequently mystical but  sometimes social.  In all the poems need to be read multiple times and read  with a holistic mind not a linear, verbal mind ... but the effort involved  is well rewarded.	2000-06-09

Bradshaw has written a readable, slim volume describing cathedral and monastic prayer - their appropriate use, history,  the need for both in a full spiritual life ...<br />Cathedral prayer is the  communal prayer with fixed roles, use of external signs, etc. generally  oriented towards the benefit of the world at large.  Monastic prayer is the  private prayer with temporary roles, external signs only as training  devices, generally oriented towards the benefit of the one praying.  This  distinction derives from early church practices.<br />Bradshaw shows that  either practiced to the exclusion of the other is harmful - to the church  and to the individual.<br />Consider this an essential book for anyone  interested in prayer, liturgy or spiritual direction.	2000-06-08

It follows, to varying degrees of detail, the lives of several individuals who  lead intersecting lives.  Don't consider this &quot;just another Holocaust  novel&quot; - it is a significant and unique addition to the corpus of  Jewish Holocaust literature.<br />Katschen is a very low key novella following  the life of an orphan in Palestine - describing life through the very  imaginative child's point of view.  Katschen's view is a delightful mix of  naivete, taking words literally, and a vivid visual imagination.  His life  is followed through care by an aunt, by an elderly uncle, thru a kibbutz, a  friendly Arab, the police and finally by his father - a man confined to an  insane asylum through most of the story.<br />Both tales include footnotes  that translate the bits of German, Yiddish, Hebrew and Arabic that  occasionally occur.  This multilingual facet is the only trace of a  scholarly background on the part of the author.<br />Yoel Hoffman is an author  with absolutely stunning control over his story - an unerring sense of  concrete detail in sparse prose.  I have yet to find any of his work less  than awe inspiring.	2000-06-08

One difference is that the characters are less \\"black and white\\" - the crocodile is clever, the monkey is cleverer. Neither is foolish.<br />Jataka tales are stories of previous births of the Buddha i.e. similar to the more complex avadanas that are translated from the Sanskrit or Tibetan traditions. While the children's books of them are fun and well worth reading, at some point reading a more comprehensive selection should be on the agenda. This book is just a fun introduction for a young child.	2000-06-04

If you expect to see stories as in many of his other books, this is not the book you are looking  for.  Rather this book is more along the lines of Wellsprings i.e. material  for guided meditation best done in a group where someone reads the material  aloud to the the group rather than an individual interrupting the prayer  rhythm to read the next section.  If not done in a group, one can at least  tape the material.<br />Each exercise set includes a bodily awareness  exercise, a focusing statement to set the tone for the exercise of  reflection on a Biblical story - reflection in the Ignatian (Jesuit)  exercise sense of imagining oneself in the scene - and a concluding quote,  usually scriptural, that in some sense ties the exercise together without  forcing a single conclusion.<br />As usual, material from de Mello is solid  religious psychology/spiritual direction without being doctrinal.	2000-06-04

The tale is written for young children to enjoy while carrying lightly a message regarding in  appropriate pride.  It is also interesting as the tale is of a princess (of  the birds) choosing a husband - a subtle point that feminists may enjoy.  However, rather than being feminist, this is a subtle reminder of the  difference between our image of South Asian culture and the actual culture.  To prepare your child to live in a truly global society, jataka tales are  a useful tool - independent of the religious meaning of the tale.	2000-06-04

Admittedly my view has  mellowed, but Kathleen Moore's essays lack the almost mystical quality one  finds in the essays of Kim Stafford, Annie Dillard etc.<br />Several of the  essays, however, are charming especially her meditations on poking around,  on her elderly neighbor, and on the funeral arrangements for her father.  From her essays as a whole, one gets a sense of life fully lived in the  details.<br />This is a book I enjoyed, am glad to have read but am unapt to  read more than one or two essays again.	2000-06-04

The subtitle is both accurate and a teaser - the novel never slips into crudeness even when  presenting crude behaviour.<br />The tale - a woman transforming into a pig  and writing her story when she has accepted a pig life style - is a  difficult story to successfully write.  Darrieusseeq makes a few slips but  clearly establishes herself as an author to be watched.<br />The social  message of the book is a little overbearing, a little &quot;plastic&quot;.

The portrayal of the emotions, their  &quot;wallop&quot;, will remain with you long after you've finished the  novel and the plot line is forgotten - in this sense, those who read for  the quality of the writing may enjoy this book more than those who read for  action and plot.	2000-06-03

In this volume there are several memorable poems:  \\"Getting to the Front of the Stable\\" explores the role of Joseph in the  Christmas story.  \\"The Refugees\\" speaking of the Holy Family in Egypt is  also a reflection on our treatment of refugees at the Mexican border.  \\"Boxed\\" shows how cheap and tattered cr&egrave;che figures can acquire meaning far  beyond their value.<br />Yes, there are poems I dislike, but  as a whole this  volume is worth reading before the Advent/Christmas season - it provides  some solid insights into a realistic, human and religious approach to the  season	2000-06-02

There is a strong mystical element in the story; unlike some literature  that has a mystical undercurrent, the book remains concrete and  `realistic'.  The story line is of living on a train - a train on an  endless journey - with passengers who are often unaware that they are on a  train.  \\"Outside the train\\" is where the dead are pushed.

It illustrates the two major ways of adjusting to the control -  flight by the son and obedience by the daughter.  It builds to an  interesting climax where the daughter (now 80) acts for herself.

In this bi- and tri-lingual text, he has justified my confidence in him.<br />The poets translated in the volume have a varied amount of  &quot;Indian-ness&quot; - some speak the Indian language of the group with  which they identify, some do not.  The poems themselves range from poems  that show a non-Spanish aesthetic to those that are openly  &quot;Spanish&quot; in some sense.  For example, a poem by Jaime Luis  Huenun is titled &quot;After Reading So Much Cesar Vallejo&quot;, and three  poems of Graciela Huinao remind me of the sparseness of haiku.<br />My  favorite of the poets in Elicura Chihuailaf whose poems center around blue  - a color with strong ties to the Indian culture.  These poems are perhaps  the most Indian, but the poems are universal in the depiction of humanity  and its relationship to the rest of nature while being accessible and  particular in terms of images.<br />These poems are well worth your time.	2000-05-31

However, this book has several positives that make it worth reading and rereading: 1) the book is very well structured into short  segments titled with a summary of the action - the titles themselves bear  much of the meaning of the story as if they formed a poem of which the text  is a commentary 2) the text is extremely well written - a lesson in  effective use of words 3) the text is thought provoking - the sexual,  drunken crudeness is demanded of the text not a superficial addon.  You  will be forced to reconsider your notion of death, evil and pleasure. 4)  the drawings capture the madness (darkness} of the tale<br />While the book  can be read quickly, multiple readings are needed to tease out meaning(s)  ... and it is well worth those multiple readings.	2000-05-28

It is a book that makes me wish to be more broadly educated in European literature - for  when I was familiar with the biography and works of the individual, the  matching of the imagined dream to the individual was more clear.  For  example, the dream of Federico Garcia Lorca picks up on his work regarding  deepsong.  Lorca is on stage singing a Gypsy song &quot;a song about duels  and orange groses, passion and death&quot; ...  A small black dog leads him  towards his death as a traitor ... The dream is a wonderful mix of clarity  and chaotic jumps, as are real dreams.<br />Tabucchi writes in his normal taut  prose - with wonderful lines to mull over: &quot;Life is indecipherable,  answered Pessoa.  Never ask and never believe.  Everything is  hidden.&quot;<br />But this book, unlike his other works requires significant  knowledge of his reader.  If you've never read Tabucchi, I would suggest  that you begin with any of his other books.  If you are a Tabucchi fan,  this new book will not disappoint you.	2000-05-26

I don't know what Jesus believed  about the seriousness of his illness.<br />2) The author is more certain of  God's nature than I am willing to be.  For example she gives a list of  things God cannot do - interfere with humankind's freedom of choice, change  what has already happened - I do not know if God cannot or if he chooses  not to ...<br />3) the author consistently uses &quot;we&quot; when describing  how we respond to situations.  When that is not how I respond, the text  makes me uncomfortable with the author's assumptions.<br />Somewhat to my  surprise, given my concerns above, I found the bibliography has several  books I know and love (along with a couple I know and don't love).

Not because it was new but rather that it was to me self-evident.  For example,  I had been taught with regards to God's omniscience and man's freewill that  the two concepts framed a mystery we could not understand but could perhaps  pull the frame together a bit to point at the truth we cannot fully  know.<br />I was similarly caught off-guard by the seeming suprise with which  the author confronted the myriad of world calendars - Jewish, Islamic, Thai  etc.  The effects on one's Christianity of either assuming the 2nd coming  is near or that it is far off in cosmological time had interest.<br />Of more  interest to me, is the author's growth in understanding the issues related  to gender based language.<br />If one has a faith based on certainities, if  one has not confronted the issues with which the author deals in a  universal and transcultural way, then this book has a great deal to offer.  It will help place your faith in the real world - with all the real word  messiness.<br />If one has a faith based on uncertainities, thought out in  universal, transcultural and across multiple faith, then this book has a  great deal to offer in learning how the other side thinks and grows.	2000-05-23

Cioraan, Wang Wei, and Gerard Manley Hopkins is sure to get my attention for I love them all.  Therefore, I am biased for Charles Wright's &quot;Appalachia&quot;.<br />Charles Wright  has many wonderful images: &quot;Remembered landscapes are left in me / The  way a bee leaves its sting&quot;.  There are also lines of religious depth:  &quot; . . . to get to God, pull both your feet back - / One foot from out  of this life, one foot from the other&quot;.<br />Unfortunately, at the end of  the book, what I recalled are wonderful lines not wonderful poems.  Well  worth reading, even rereading and certainly better than much of  contemporary poetry.	2000-05-22

Place the line in the context of half a book structured as a response to  Franny and Zooey by Salinger - response either by the 15 year old ... or  the 40 year old he became.  Add to this some sloppy thought - confusing the  offerings of Cain and Abel.  You are now envisioning the better part of  Wind of Knives.<br />However, at the end of the book, especially the scene at  the youth leader retreat, or the phone call to his younger brother, you  suddenly slip into a well written and interesting book.  Unfortunately this  is by far the smaller portion of the book.	2000-05-22

On the Shores of Eternity complements rather than replaces Gitanjali.  Especially interesting are the fragments from Tagore's  notebooks which are not in Gitanjali.  E.g. &quot;Words cling to the dead  like dust / Silence washes their souls.&quot;  Tagore's poetry still shows  him to be a worthy recipient of the Nobel Prize for literature.<br />On the  other hand, I was not impressed by the introduction by Chopra ... whether  it is helpful to you will depend upon your background in mysticism and  literature.  He makes too much of Tagore's friendly relationship with death  - St. Francis wrote of &quot;our Sister Bodily Death&quot;.  Tagore's  mysticism is in the long tradition of the collective world - east or west -  his uniqueness is the superb poetry in which he shares his experience; this  is not the emphasis of the introduction.  But who cares - the poems are  well worth pausing over.	2000-05-21

She writes with a clear self-understanding as belonging to two cultures - American and Hispanic.  Many of her poems are of a  &quot;foreign&quot; culture as they reflect Mexican culture - magicians,  spells, and appropriate female behavior.  However, her poems are such gems  this &quot;foreignness&quot; is never a barrier - rather the reader is  privileged to share her perspective.  My personal favorite (at the moment  and subject to instant change) is &quot;1910&quot; with the repeating image  of black shawl, black gloves as she moves from respect in Mexico to  discrimination in El Paso.  But other poems e.g. &quot;Love Ritual&quot;  with a wonderful opening &quot;In Mexico the dead are lured  / back for a  day with marigolds and / candles ...&quot; beg to be mentioned as well.	2000-05-21

The Disciplina Clericalis of  Petrus Alfonis is an excellent starting point.<br />Petrus Alfonis was a  Spanish convert (in 1106) to Christianity who had spent significant time in  Egypt. His book which includes exempla, proverbs, fables etc. illustrates  the way stories drift across religious boundaries as his tales come from  all three traditions with which he was familiar.  It will also remind you  of the longevity of stories ... You may recognize a tale of a dog as a  southern tall tale.<br />The translation is very readable; if your interest is  strictly in the stories themselves, you lose nothing by skipping the  introduction but the introduction is useful in setting the context and the  influence of the book.<br />Consider this a must for storytellers, especially  religious storytellers.	2000-05-20

The tales themselves come from Rumi, Attar and a host of other sources - written and oral.  While I recommend both Rumi and Attar, the retelling of the stories  in a concise and oral telling style is a gift to the reader - one is  impacted by the story itself and not distracted by the form of the story  (poetry of Rumi) or by the frame story (as in Attar).<br />One should read  these stories one at a time and reflect on them as you would a koan, if you  wish to treat them as &quot;spiritually beneficial&quot;.  But they are  also enjoyable as a quick read for laughs...................	2000-05-20

I put &quot;commentary&quot; in quotes as it is more a response  to the Biblical passage - a poem, reflections ...<br />The art ranges from  work that derives from Western sensibilites, to tradition &quot;high  culture&quot; Eastern works, to folk traditions. For example, the passage  from Isaiah &quot;they will rise on wings like eagles&quot; is accompanied  by a New Zealand poem including the lines &quot;Lord, Holy Spirit, / You  are as the mother eagle with her young&quot;  The art is a Taiwanese brush  painting of an eagle.  The commentary on the painting includes a statement  from the artist on her gratitude to God for her artistic talent.<br />A  particularly effective piece is &quot;The Angry Christ&quot; painted by an  artist from the Philippines and accompanied by a poem from Indonesian.<br />The book is based on a sensibility similar to Jo Milgrom's work  &quot;Handmade Midrash&quot;.  I highly recommend it.	2000-05-19

Here she has paired her words to Stephen Strom's photographs.  His photographs of landscapes have an unusual and very  effective use of colors ... many reminding me of the softness of watercolor  or pastels.<br />Joy Harjo has provided text - somewhere between prose and  prose poems - that engage the accompanying photographs to create a mythic  sense.  For example a photo of rose-tinted desert sand with no sky  (Overlook west of Tuba City)is accompanied by &quot;Two sisters meet on  horseback.  They gossip: a cousin eloped with someone's husband, twins were  born to his wife.  One is headed toward Tsaile, and the other to Round  Rock.  Their horses are rose sand, with manes of ashy rock.&quot;<br />An  excellent book.	2000-05-18

I believe that they accurately describe the translation process in a manner  that adequately describes the parts that are translated by equivalent  English wit and that which is translated in a more literal  sense.<br />However, if you are reading for enjoyment, the translation  questions become irrelevant - the book stands on its own in English without  any reason that the reader needs to recognize that it is a translation.  The book tells an extremely slim story in multiple styles e.g. rhyming  slang, mathematical, abusive, medical, epenthesis, haiku, logical analysis,  sonnet, tactile ...  The book is enjoyable as a quick read - but even more  enjoyable if read attentively i.e. noting the differences in what is  observed, spoken, omitted in each variation ... the difference in artistic  and experiental impact of the story enforced by the perspective of the  variation etc.<br />That the book can sustain such a simple story is evidence  of a master writer: &quot;On a crowded bus at midday, Raymond Queneau  observes one man accusing another of jostling him deliberatly.  When a seat  is vacated, the first man appropriates it.  Later, in another part of town,  Queneau sees the man being advised by a friend to sew another button on his  overcoat.&quot;	2000-05-18

This anthology of short excerpts should be read in a meditational manner - he gives one much  to think about - to not think about it is to miss the point of the  book.<br />An example: &quot;Life passes on in proximity to the sacred, and it  is this proximity that endows existence with ultimate significance.  In our  relation to the immediate we touch upon the most distant.  Even the  satisfaction of physical needs can be a sacred act.  Perhaps the essential  message of Judaism is that in doing the finite we may perceive the  infinite.&quot;<br />This perception of the infinite in the finite is what is  called &quot;sacramental imagination&quot; in the Christian tradition ...  which is to say while Heschel is fully within the Judaic tradition, one  need not be of his tradition to learn from him.<br />Add this to your must  read list.	2000-05-17

It provides the right instructions for  making bread from a sponge, tells you how to tell by feel when the bread is  kneeded sufficiently ... and gives some excellent bread recipes - leavened,  unleaven, quick and a variety in between.  It has a recipe for Japanese  vegetable pancakes that serve easily as meals or snack for small children.  It has two dessert recipies - cream cheese bar cookies and peach kuchen  that quickly become standards.  In short, I highly recommend the book.	2000-05-16

Only at her  return to Assisi with a Franciscan study group did the structure of the  book begin to appear.  Only in the last chapters of the book did the need  for the first half of the book become apparent.<br />As for the internal  spiritual journey, Patricia Hampl has a perspective that is useful and  uncommon - the problem is not God but is prayer.  Her resolution comes on  retreat in Northern California - a resolution that has several insightful  observations on prayer.<br />There are individuals for whom Virgin Time should  be &quot;required reading&quot; - others will find that it is an  interesting one-time read from which they will learn little other than how  personal a spiritual path must be - different questions as primary -  different aspects of the answer missing.<br />The best way to learn if this  book is for you is to read it.	2000-05-15

I would love to have the book contain  more of Evans art but would not give up the text.  Mary Lyons has conveyed  the social difficulties of being African-American in the early twentieth  century not by &quot;preaching&quot; but by letting the story speak for  itself.  The result is a book that is appealing both for its art and for  its social conscience.	2000-05-13

Brown is best known for his large The Birth of the Messiah and the two volumes on the death of Christ.  Those are readable texts aimed at a more scholarly crowd.  A Coming of Christ in Advent is one of a group of  slim volumes that collect his essays for magazines.  In these essays he  shows the same skill for scholarly work and equal skill at making it  meaningful to today's Christian - not as Biblical study but as meaningful  to one's life.<br />My favorite section in this particular volume is the study  of the genealogy in Matthew's Gospel - the points regarding the women  mentioned as all being &quot;outsiders&quot; was one of several provocative  points.  I'm sure other readers would pick out different highlights  depending upon the conditions under which they read the book - there are  many possible highlights to chose between.	2000-05-12

He is living in a religious house in France trying to regain his  emotional and spiritual balance - his plight little understood by all but  one who surround him.  Rio has written an excellent story in his usual  tight prose.  I recommend this book.<br />(For another view of a priest  dealing with unspeakable cruelty see the poems of William Ruddy.)	2000-05-12

It is liberally sprinkled with quotations from the liturgies - in a sense similar to some of the resource  books for seasons put out by various presses.  In addition it describes the  practices of various liturgical families, of various ethnic groups and of  Catholic and Orthodox rites.<br />It was here that I first learned that Tre  Ore on Good Friday was not an ancient tradition but rather grew out of  Jesuit practice in Peru in the 17th century.  On the same page we read of  Egeria's experiences in Jerusalem in the 5th century ... of the readings in  the Armenian lectionary ... etc.<br />This is an absolutely delightful book  that assists anyone in deepening their understanding of the liturgies of  Holy Week/Triduum.	2000-05-12

One that is inspired is the title poem &quot;Here's to High Heels': &quot;Here's to all  the others / who dance in high-heeled shoes / (not many of us left) / Betty  Grable died today, &quot; ....&quot;Rent us a dance hall / with strenuous  floor / over the garage / with red wire gas pumps / ...<br />The author's  drawings which accompany the poems indicated a wickedly delightful sense of  humor - &quot;pianos I have known&quot; is a personal favorite.<br />Much of  the poetry is the tough, hard-life rural poetry one expects from Seven  Buffaloes Press.  But these are also the poems of an intelligent, artistic  woman - at home with Miro as well.  In short don't stereotype Patricia  Elliot, she writes from a very broad base of experience and interessts.	2000-05-12

Anything less either needs a larger format or shouldn't have been  written.<br />In little pictures, andrew ramer makes very few misteps.  He has  written a series of stories that could easily be collected por quoi stories  - but they are original and surrealistic.  Some wonderful teasers to give  you a sense of what Ramer accomplishes:<br />&quot;in the beginning, people  did not speak. not the way we do.  they spoke with their hands.&quot;<br />My  personal favorite is &quot;eating&quot;: &quot;in the old days people did  not eat. not the way we do. they ate with their eyes.  this can be seen in  ancient statues.  where the mouths are tiny little holes, and the eyes are  huge as dinner plates.&quot;<br />Note that between the two quotes, there is  just enough repetition to remind you of collected folk-tales.  But the lack  of capitals and somewhat unusual punction draw you into post-modern  expectations.<br />This is one of my top 100 books.	2000-05-12

But this volume has a fascinating discussion on the social dimensions of posture in a ritual meal.  There is exploration of the  history behind posture - begining with adoration as action ... and kneeling  arising out of kissing ....<br />Throughout the book wears its scholarship  easily - creating an easy read that forces you to reevaluate the use of  posture in your own faith community.	2000-05-11

(2) it includes items for  which scholarly arguments have been made for a female author even if those  arguments are speculative e.g. the author of the Letter to the Hebrews.  This includes canonical and apocryphal works. (3) it includes a wide  variety of languages e.g. the entries for Anna Comnena include English,  French, Greek, Polish and Russian.<br />Its most annoying feature?  Enticing  me with wonderful headings such as Armenian hymnographers ... and showing  no English entries.

In the 24 actions, Donghi covers all the common gestures.  Donghi is firmed rooted in the  post-Vatican II church - thinking to include being seated and listening in  his actions.

The poem was, I was told, something that came out of research with the migrant fruit  workers.  True or not, that description fits Oh How can I Keep on Singing?:  Voices of Pioneer Women.<br />I was raised partially in the Okanogan so I  can't claim to be impartial in my praise of these poems.  They do a  wonderful job of bringing forth the dirt, hunger, poverty and violence of  the pioneer days in the Okanogan.  Therefore, the poems nicely  counterbalance the tendency to idealize the pioneer era - this is no House  on the Praire.<br />Jana Harris has done an excellent job of giving the  pioneer women individual voices - these are poems of a collection of  individuals not of a homogenious mass of &quot;pioneer  women&quot;.<br />Finally, as tightly written poems, the stories have more  emotional impact than they might have had in prose.<br />(I will confess  that I also recommend anything by Jana Harris but this or Mahattan as a  Second Language is the place to start.)	2000-05-10

Her's is a poetry of Krishna - an Indian diety relatively well known in the West if only for his place in the Mahabharata.<br />This  translation of Mirabai's poetry from a Prakrit (a vernacular language  rather than the formal Sanskrit - i.e. as if in Provencal rather than  Latin) uses free verse to put her poems in our contemporary poetry  conventions.  Andrew Schelling did a superb job - the poetry retains the  South Asian religious sensibility while creating poems that stand on their  own merit.<br />A taste: &quot;But life on this crazy planet is torment, / day  and night torment. / Mad, raked by separation -- / drifting from country to  country -- / look at Mira's black hair / it's turned white.<br />If you enjoy  Rumi, Hafiz, Kabir,Emre then you will enjoy this book.	2000-05-08

Finally a book of Egyptian love poetry for people with enough of Budge to recognize a hieroglyph or two :-)  More seriously the hieroglyphs are primarily &quot;atmosphere&quot; in this text.  Curiously, the hieroglyphs  are not the original but rather transcriptions of the original cursive  hieratic ... a bit of posturing that mildly concerned me when I first saw  the book.  Fortunately, the quality of the translated poetry more than  compensated for my qualms.<br />Having been introduced to Egyptian love poetry  by the use of Michael Fox's work in a class on the Song of Songs (aka Song  of Solomon), I was delighted to find this gem.  The poetry is translated  without footnotes - a feature I appreciate.<br />An example of the joys of  the poems: &quot;He had made a hushed sell in the thicket, for worship / to  dedicate this day / To holy elevation of flesh&quot;<br />Because of the  relationship of Egyptian love poetry to the Song of Songs, this scarely  known poetry has had an effect on our culture - one as worth exploring as  the Greek or Latin.	2000-05-08

Ms. Fowler has translated  these poems with philogical assistance from Fox.  The result is a very  readable translation - enjoyable on it's own.  However, I found myself  going back to Fox for the background to truly understand some of the poems  - the cultural chasm and the passage of time eroded the meaning of the  poems to me.<br />However, the translations are lightly footnoted with  required information e.g. that Menqet is the goddess of beer or that a word  is added for meter. While I prefer translations that stand on their own,  this is a good choice for an introduction to a little known poetry that had  significant impact on our culture indirectly via the Song of Songs	2000-05-08

But what a delightful diverse collection: Church Fathers such as  Polycarp, Origen, Ephrem Syrus, Prudentius ; apocrypha such as Acts of  Peter; a variety of Liturgies such as Chaldean, Syriac, Coptic,  Armenian.<br />The strength of the text is its diversity - the reminder to the  Western Church of the influence and strengths of the Eastern Church.  Similarly, the diversity reminds us of the different emphasises required  for different people, for different times, and in different places.	2000-05-07

The book  justifies itself on the photography alone.<br />I am less enthusiastic about  the text - although my lack of familarity with the available texts may have  biased my evaluation.  The proverbs, hymns and songs which are quoted have  no specifically Amish/Mennonite quality e.g. &quot;Well begun is half  done&quot;.

Andrew Schelling has produced a translation which  reads as poetry - as poetry that can be enjoyed without any cultural  introduction - that can be enjoyed even more if one knows something of its  context.  An example: &quot;Unable to cast / a semblance / of my girl's  face, her dark eyes, / no doubt the moon / is reshaping its cold / disc,  only / again to dissolve it&quot;<br />Exquisite poetry in Sanskrit, exquisite  poetry in English.

The premise of the book - a monk trying to draw a perfect map of the world - frames the story in a worldview very different than our own.  Understanding  the prefect map to require knowledge of the flora, fauna and culture of the  place is far from our concern with projections and satellite  accuracy.<br />Once one has understood the fundamental world view of the monk,  the story becomes an interesting unfolding of stories from a variety of  travelers - some true, some fanciful - that slowly brings Fra Mauro to  question the presuppositions of his world view.<br />As such, the book helps  us to understand something of the strain on European culture as it opened  out to the rest of the world in the age of exploration.	2000-05-07

Annie Ernaux is an author whose appeal is difficult to define - she writes autobiographical prose that is sparse, clear, honest and a bit hard.  In her very particular experience, she writes prose that is emotionally  universally true.<br />The mother we meet in &quot;I Remain in Darkness&quot;  is a very different woman than we met in &quot;A Woman's Place&quot;.  The  strong woman previously depicted descends into dependence. Written in the  form of a dated journal, Ms. Ernaux traces her mother's descent into  Alzheimer's - first recognizing that her mother can no longer live alone,  she moves her mother in with her; this is followed by the recognition that  she can no longer care for her mother; finally, her mother dies in a  nursing home.<br />A simple and common experience.  But Annie Ernaux in a slim  volume captures the changing emotions that follow the changes in her  mother's situation in a way few authors can.	2000-05-07

The degree to which South Asian poetry is unfamilar to America is made clear by the line under Editorial Reviews that tags this poetry as Sanskrit rather than Prakrit.  Prakrit is a generic term that encompasses a various  of languages that fall between the various Vedic/Sanskrit classical  language and the modern Indo-European languages.<br />Unlike Andrew  Schelling's free verse translations of Sanskrit poetry, David Ray  translates the Prakrit &quot;quartrains&quot; (technically sloka's) into  English quartrains.  Like Andrew Schelling, David Ray translates the poems  into poetry enjoyable without knowledge of the culture in which they were  written.<br />Some of these poems have a sparseness one associates with  Eastern Asia rather than South Asia e.g. &quot;Afraid of putting out / the  lamp / with her tears, / she moves it aside&quot; - others have the more  ornate structures associated with South Asia.  The translation reflects the  diversity of the original anthology - a great read you shouldn't miss.	2000-05-07

After reading this book you will understand the distinction  between theology of liturgy, liturical studies and liturgical  theology.<br />Liturgical theology is the theology embedded in the rituals and  words of liturgy ... it is the theology embodied in our liturgy.  Understanding Schmemann's view of liturgy provides a framework for  understanding the liturgical practices of any denomination including those  claiming to be nonliturgical.

Kneeling in Jerusalem is a book which would interest and alienate a wide audience.  The book is printed as if it were all poetry - there are some poetic gems but there is also simply &quot;verse&quot; for which the only  apparent reason for the verse format is to remind you to read in a  meditative spirit.  There is also verse that is better than average  &quot;devotional&quot; reading - some readers will enjoy it, others will  consider it pablum.<br />The content of the poems is equally diverse - some  (e.g. the children's sermon) are excellent stories that carry religious  truth ... they would stand up well in the works of Anthony deMello ... some  are moral mediations (e.g. numbers) that make a deliberate point.  Some  would serve well in guided meditations.  But some readers, including  myself, will tire of the assumption that the reader/listener leads an  overhectic life - leaving no time for prayer and contemplation.<br />I  recommend the book ... but keep your perspective one of recognition that in  this case in order to appeal to a broad audience there is something for you  and something not for you.	2000-04-07

It forces  one to consider the downplaying of humor and the emphasis on seriousness in  the Christian tradition - for myself this brought up interesting issues  with regards to the Holy Fools tradition and the Laughing Buddha  tradition.<br />The joy of reading this book is even greater - the reader gets  a bonus in postmodern literary analysis in the book's interpretation of  Eco's The Name of the Rose.

Duras with a touch of Jabes!  Duras approaches death with an honest mix of human  emotions - sometimes very attached to Yann, sometimes reconciled to death  as the ultimate letting go of Yann; sometimes proud and nearly pretentious  regarding her writings, sometimes humbly expecting to be soon forgotten.  Unlike some authors writing in similiar straits, Duras feels no need to  pretend that age has made her wise.

Yet in the short passage a  real three dimensional portrait of a hard, drinking man unmissed except,  perhaps, by his wife.<br />No one is wholely evil or wholely saint ... in fact  the motivation for hiding the Jew in the box is less than morally pure.  And the Jew, isolated in his box with adolescents as his primary audience,  has a wide range of responses to his current situation and to his excessive  time to review his past.<br />This is not yet a great book but it is very good  and its strength indicate that Thomas Moran is a writer well worth watching  for.	2000-03-08

This time I was well rewarded.  Japriscot's work, like most authors, varies in quality - this book falling  close to the middle of his quality.  A Trap for Cinderella is interesting  because of the intrigue upon intrigue as to the identity of the burn  victim.  The final answer is neither self-evident nor surprising.  Rather  the reader is led through a narrowing maze of possibility until finally the  final answer is disclosed - an answer that is satisfying because it has  been threaded throughout the story as one possible outcome.	2000-03-08

The form of the poetry evokes (and occasionally uses) the forms of the Biblical Psalms.  The subject matter sometimes corresponds to the Biblical expectations as well.  But within  this framework, the poetry is firmly committed to a very urban, hard and  somewhat dark view of contemporary life.  The poet is very skilled - the  craftsmanship is there but invisible - i.e. the content rather than craft  comes through in reading these poems.  This book is well worth reading -  even if you find you don't like the poems, your appreciation for poetry  should be expanded by seeing what April Bernard has achieved	2000-03-02

A comparison of the Spanish and the English gives some  indication of the choices made in translation.  I would buy the book solely  to support its trilingual intent.<br />However, I recommend the book based on  content.  The poets range from political to traditional - every reader will  have their own favorites.  My favorites are: 1) Red Skirt - a delightful  exploration of male/female interactions 2) Black Louse, White Louse - a  poem that reminds me of a local Native American louse tale<br />You will find  most of the poems heavily influenced by contemporary Hispanic poetry but  retaining a sufficient touch of Quechua culture to set them apart.

The Sleeping-Car Murders is best read as you would read any book by Agatha  Christie, etc. etc. ... read as a book of the mystery genre the book is  well plotted and has an excellent, surprising and realistic conclusion.  However, the reader is unlikely to identify with the &quot;detective&quot;;  rather it is easier to identify with the young woman coming to Paris for  the first time.  And unlike One Deadly Summer, most of the characters are  painted sufficiently well to carry the story but not so well that the  reader particularly cares what happens to them.<br />For a delightly, fun and  casual read, I recommend the book.	2000-03-02

The premise and plot are sound within the scope of a novel telescoping time into a short period  of the characters' lives rather than the realistic time that would cross  multiple life times.<br />However, I wish the book had been better editted or  researched ... the sequence of the elements of the Mass was incorrect, the  liturgical calendar was incorrect, the understanding of consecrated hosts  was incorrect ... I don't believe that the intention of the author was to  make me laugh at this point.<br />On the positive side, I enjoyed the realism  of the range of motivations and faith of the priests, the recognition that  virtue and human weakness exist side by side, the non-confrontive  questioning of the origin of evil and the apparent non-responsiveness of  God.<br />If you enjoy a fun read that still makes you think, this is a book  for you.  If you only read &quot;great literature&quot; that you believe  should stick around for a few decades (or centuries), this isn't your  taste.	2000-03-02

Read my review in this context.<br />The novel begins with a gypsy finding a corpse ... the  initial scene is interesting in terms of the socio-political critique of  the Portugese/Spanish treatment of the gypsies.  Like Tabucchi's previously  published Fernando Pessoa, the main character is a journalist; the story  moves in a direction different than that implied by the opening scene.  However, the expectation of the exploration of socio-political nature is  met.<br />While I prefer Tabucchi's work outside of the &quot;thriller&quot;  genre of the last two novels, his writing (and its translation) are so well  done that the genre is unimportant - in any genre, he writes stories that  make you think as well as making you loath to set the book down.<br />If you  like literary thrillers, The Missing Head of Damasceno Monteiro is  certainly in the same category as Canone Inverso, Class Trip, and The Name  of a Bullfighter all of which are in some way masterful.	2000-03-02

You'll certainly not find the stories in nice neat packages that retelling of the tales provide but  in the 4 volumes of the translated Siva Purana, you'll have a nice  leisurely stroll through the myths surrounding Siva, one of the better  known Hindu deities.  The translation is not perfect but the problems  translating from Sanskrit to English is difficult especially when little  previous knowledge of the subject matter can be assumed.  The Puranic  Encyclopaedia (editted by Vettam Mani) can certainly be of assistance.  Alternatively, reading the work of Wendy O'Flaherty or John Hawley provides  a very readable introduction to the world view behind the stories.<br />Tho  daunting at first, reading the Puranas quickly becomes addictive -  wonderful stories within stories ... and should you tire of Siva, the  series contains about 96 more volumes to tempt you.	1999-08-28

This slim volume is based on the Exodus of the Hebrew people from Egypt - told from the point of view of a loner, an orphan whose mother was cruelly killed by the Egyptians.  The book is definately worth reading but  certainly is not great.  The book tries to re-interpret the story in a  down-to-earth, non-miraclous manner. To succeed the book must either  reflect the world view of the traditional exodus or reinterpret the story  in a manner that justifies the growth of the  religious myth around it.

What truly sets these poems apart,  however, is the quiet wisdom that permeates them - to paraphrase an example  &quot;the hell of thinking only what one already knows&quot;.

Now Andrew Schelling has provided a readily available text for  Northern India.  While the vast majority of these lyric poems are written  in strictly metered quartrains, Schelling does a marvelous job of rendering  the poems in free form - depending upon the images and sounds rather than  the meter to translate the poetry into English (as opposed to the early  stiff quatrain translations that encouraged no one to read Sanskrit/Prakrit  poetry).<br />The selection of poetry is not &quot;representative&quot; of the  anthologies but represent the translator's personal choice around the theme  of eroticism.  The translator's affinity for the selected poems shows in  the excellent translations - faithful to the original text [yes I have read  them in their original form] yet solid as English poetry.	1998-10-09

Lorca has written both an essay on Deep Song and a book of Deep Song  poetry - they should be read together.<br />While Lorca, Falla and others'  theory of the origin of Deep Song in the gypsy tradition is now discounted,  the sensitivity Lorca shows in trying to retain a traditional form is  wonderful. [Current theory gives more influence to the original Andalusian,  Saracen, and Shephardic influences which had already developed into Deep  Song when the gypsies arrived].<br />In fact, one should also read some  Arab-Andulsian poetry along with Deep Song.  The poems of Deep Song are not  Lorca's best but they are important for understanding Lorca's cultural  sensibilities.  The use of refrains, the use of a varient of the opening  stanza as a closing stanza etc. are techniques that are clearly in the  hands of a master although the poems were written early in his  career.<br />Now, if I could only find out the meaning of certain repeating  images such as yellow serpent.	1998-10-08

The &quot;museum piece&quot; teaser in the review summary refers to  the short essay at the end of the book arguing cogently for a reduction in  population, a more communal life style, etc. - a piece well written in its  time but one that has portions which need rewriting in light of the  increased opportunities for recycling etc.  The poetry, however, does stand  the test of time.  Snyder's poetry reflects the directness of Zen poetry -  his nature is real nature not nature conjured up for imagery or  &quot;concreteness&quot;.  His knowledge of mythological symbols -  including Turtle Island - is deep; his is not a superficial borrowing.  Gary Snyder would be on my short list of &quot;most know&quot; poets and  Turtle Island is a good place start becoming familiar with his work.	1998-09-21

This book is an extremely well balanced collection of poetry and drawings  by Ryokan.  I know no Japanese to assess the &quot;accuracy&quot; of the  translation, but the poems all stand as poetry in their own right in  English.  Many poems are similar to the Chinese Zen (Chan) poetry - drawing  on keen observation rather than metaphor.  Others are delightful pieces in  which the poet gently laughs at himself.  A few poems have a didactic  intent but Ryokan's understanding of Buddhism leaves little room for the  Buddhist scholastics.

However, some of the poems seem contrived; some seem muddled in a  &quot;sufified&quot; Christianity; some seem didactic.  Unfortunately not  one of the three descriptions mentioned above is particularly appealing to  me.

The book is a wonderfully broad selection of poets  and styles including poets with a strong Taoist bent - a happy addition  illustrating the coexistence of multiple religious traditions within single  individuals.  There are differing styles of translation - from the more  literal to the more poetic - but only two poems in the entire book that  leave me wanting to read the original Chinese because the translation seems  too free.  The book as a whole is a marvelous example of the force of  poetry that is rooted in experience rather than metaphor; as such it should  be read by  those without a specific interest in Buddhism.<br />My criticism?  Too many poets are represented by only one or two poems.	1998-09-17

Some of the incidental characters are flat - the complaint about the &quot;three stooges&quot; in a previous review was not unfair.  I would rate The Class Trip or The Name of a Bullfighter as more successful as mystery/thrillers but would certainly add The Seville Connection to the list as well worth the time even if it doesn't keep one awake at night to finish it in a single reading.	1998-06-02

Deiss is, I'll admit, an author to whom I am very partial; this book is another example of why.  Fr. Deiss is a cautious scholar, careful to distinguish between reasonable assumptions and facts.  He wears his scholarship lightly - the book is very readable.  The strength of the book, however, is that one can read a reasonable &quot;childhood biography&quot; of Jesus without constantly sorting out the author's bias.  Especially useful are his depictions of Joseph and Mary - a depiction less &quot;poverty bound&quot; than some of the scholars who build a more &quot;politizing&quot; background for Jesus.	1998-03-20

He composed in a Turkic language, a language family noted for its love of language, its wordplay and doubling.  This is poetry of the highest quality with a down to earth touch resonating with divine love imagery.  A must read for anyone interested in religious poetry, bhakti poetry or Sufism.	1998-03-06

Walking Words is an excellent introduction to his style (Book of Embraces is the other starting point I would recommend).  Initially you can believe that you are reading traditional tales but by the time you get to the whorehouse you realize that his humor has caught you again.  A few stories further and you see that the stories hold together as a whole providing insight both into human nature and the political realm.  The illustrations are absolutely a perfect foil for the text.  This is definately a book to foist off on friends as a &quot;must read&quot; - it appeals to a very wide audience.  END	1998-02-18

Yet other poems reveal the eroticism of longing that one associates with Indian bhakti poets such as Mirabai; others seem to long for a God without form as one associates with Kabir.  Tagore thus represents the acceptance of some things Western while retaining a distinctively South Asian bent.  The poems themselves are excellent and wide ranging - a few are not specifically religious or spiritual.  An excellent book to read to enjoy either the Nobel prize winner Tagore or as an introduction to bhakti (devotional) poetry as a whole.	1998-02-09

The translations are secondary translations i.e. reworkings into free verse older more scholarly and literal translations.  As such they make the works more readily accessable to the non-scholar.  The stories provide a pleasant mix of relatively rare tales (stories that are quite specifically Sufi) and stories that appear in a variety of guises in different cultures and religions.  The poems run from short lyrical pieces to stories in verse form - a nice cross section of Rumi's work.  I have read several of Coleman Barks' translations - all enjoyable - and would recommend this book as a nice starting point.	1998-02-06

I started it with great misgivings expecting a highly biased interpretation.  Instead I found a well balanced retelling of Biblical stories about the relationships between women.  Weems wears her scholarship lightly, writting a highly readable book.  Her interpretation not only makes you reconsider relationships that she discovers but also gently encourages one to explore other aspects of the relationships.	1998-02-06

Were my expectations not so high, the things that are right about the book would stand out more against the portions that don't work.  She is at her best when portraying the inability to love and the bitterness at the colonialist religion.  However, there are points in the story where the political portrayal of victor vs. vanquished becomes a polemic out of character of the protagonist.  A good book that is well worth reading - but is probably more enjoyable if you have read Annie John, Lucy or One Small Place so that the political polemic fits the reader's growing knowledge of the author rather than simply being an element less adroitly handled in this particular book.	1998-02-05

This is poetry at its best exploring human relationships.  The introduction provides sufficient material to appreciate the aesthetic framework under which the poetry was originally written.  But one can appreciate the poetry without knowledge of its background - in fact, without even considering that it is a translation.	1998-02-02

However, one is never sure reading this work whether Crossan's view of Jesus as an economic / social rebel shapes his view of the essential Jesus or vice versa.  Either way the book is worth reading for both what it tells one about Jesus and what it tells on about Crossan.	1998-02-02
