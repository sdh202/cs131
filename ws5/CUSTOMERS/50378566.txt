Still suffering the emotional and physical after effects from the events in the previous entry, The Waking Nightmare, Dr. Mark Sloan takes a morning walk on the beach outside of his Malibu home...and finds a dead body.  The mystery takes an immediate turn to the personal when a strange clue links the murder to the very first homicide case Sloan investigated, back in 1962.  Sloan himself narrates the 1962 segment of the story, which is a fine little mystery, and the reader comes away knowing more about what makes the crime solving doctor tick than before.  Lee Goldberg (who wrote and produced several seasons of the Diagnosis Murder television series) has added an emotional layer to this mystery that makes it the best in the series to date.  Highly recommended.	2005-10-09

How To Talk To A Liberal (If You Must) gathers together a wide sampling of some of Ms. Coulter's more famous, and in some cases infamous, syndicated columns with some original writing to pad things out.  If the reader does not agree with Ms. Coulter's opinions, then reading her column is like being on the receiving end of one of Godzilla's atomic loogies.  Kind of like the fate that Mr. Shindo met in 1991's Godzilla Versus King Ghidorah.  If the reader agrees with Ms. Coulter, then he or she will no doubt delight in seeing someone trounce liberal ideals.  Being a Libertarian, there are some areas wherein I agreed with Ms. Coulter, and others where I most certainly did not.  Nonetheless her book was entertaining, which is her true goal, to entertain her readers with witty observations of current events.  Some of those had me chuckling.  My two favorites being, \\"Overheard at the Miss World contest: 'Does this dress make me look fatwa?'\\" and \\"If John Kerry had a dollar for every time he bragged about serving in Vietnam - Oh wait, he does.\\"  Conservatives will adore it, liberals will loathe it, and the politically mercurial will probably just enjoy it.	2005-10-02

Rick Grimes and the group of survivors he leads have found yet another place where they hope to live and start life anew, a deserted prison.  While it seems to be a secure location, cleaning out the walking dead inside proves a monumental task, and the discovery of surviving prisoners makes the group grow by four more.  However the group is far from safe, as a threat from within begins killing them one by one.  It is one of the surviving inmates, or one of the group?

What the thieves do not know is that Torrie is eager to prove herself able to the task and has slipped a tracking device into the shipment.  She follows the pirates in an attempt to get the stolen property back, but is captured by ruthless criminals instead.<br /><br />Qaade is not the average pirate.  He has stolen Torrie's cargo of Phellium for its ability to undo the devestating effects of mind swipe drugs on slaves.  Qaade is actually a slave freeing Robin Hood. When Torrie is captured during his negotiations with a ruthless crime lord, he gives up his precious Phellium to save the attractive woman from life as a slave.  But now he needs Torrie's help to get the Phellium back...<br /><br />CJ Barry is my favorite romance writer.  Each of her books are filled with action, humor and zesty romance.  The fourth book in the Un series is no exception, albeit this entry is a tad darker in tone than the previous books were, due to the story's subject matter, human slavery.

Volume 2 of The Walking Dead collects together Issues 7 through 12 of the popular horror comic, which is arguably one of the very best ones out there.  The group, reeling from Shane's breakdown and murder in the previous story arc (read Volume One: Days Gone Bye), accepts Rick as their leader.  Knowing that staying on the outskirts of Atlanta is far too dangerous, they climb into Dale's RV and begin searching for someplace safe they can live.  Along the way they meet new characters and plenty of zombies.  This arc is action packed and a tad convoluted in the character department, but the reader may not want to get too attached to any one character.  The Walking Dead remembers one of the most important rules of take-no-prisoners horror, that anyone can die at any moment.  This comic has a wonderful sucker punch, author Robert Kirkman simply loves pulling the proverbial rug out from under the stereotypical feet of the reader.  This is a great series, highest recommendation.	2005-09-13

Though they do not know it, two of the four investigators of Hell House have become hopelessly trapped by its power.  Florence Tanner is possessed, and tortured by, the randy spirit of who she thinks is Daniel Belasco.  Meanwhile Dr. Barrett is preparing to test his Electromagnetic Radiation Reversor in an arrogant attempt to dissipate the haunted house's psychic energy.  What Barrett does not know is that the house already has a defense against his little electric shock box and it fully intends to use it against them all, starting with Florence.

Han and Leia Solo, fresh from their honeymoon, attempt to slip onto Tatooine to bid on a rare, and very important to the New Republic, piece of Alderaanian art, a moss painting called Killik Twilight.  What makes it important is that a data chip containing codes and other information about rebel spies within the Empire is hidden in the painting.  Being a Star Wars adventure, things go wrong right from the get-go and Han and Leia are one step behind the painting and one step ahead of the Imperials, who want not only the painting (for different reasons) but the Solos as well.  But the chase is really just a nicely constructed Hitchcockian MacGuffin that gets Princess Leia on Tatooine and into situations and locations that allow her to discover the boy Anakin Skywalker used to be (before he became a Sith Monster) and the slave mother who mourned her son's departure to chase his dreams of glory.  So the book works as both an action adventure piece AND as an emotionally engaging character study (at least on a Space Opera level).  Fans will enjoy how Denning weaves together the Original and Prequel events and makes them fit together into one epic tale.  The paperback also includes Denning's Chewbacca story \\"A Forest Apart\\", which is a real treat for those that remember the maligned \\"Star Wars Christmas Special\\"!  Recommended.	2005-08-18

Associate Professor William Tsutsui attempts to detail and explain the alluring popularity of watching a guy in a latex suit tearing through a mock-up of a Japanese metropolis.  While he succeeds in the former (relating the history of both the series and the merchandising it spawned) Tsutsui stumbles in the latter.  The author himself admits that, as a subject, Godzilla is far too complex (what with being reinvented from bad guy to good guy and every point in between with each new film) to pigeon hole with a quaint, easy to understand theory - which does more to explain Godzilla's enduring popularity over the years, the continents, and differing generations than any critical theory could ever aspire to.  Whether adored as a city smashing monster (Gojira, 1954) or dismissed for being a cute n' cuddly Barneylike defender of The World via Japan (Godzilla Versus Gigan, Megalon et al) it can be safe to say that Godzilla will live on for at least another generation, or two.  For a fan like me, the book didn't really offer any information about The Big G that I did not already know,  but it was nice to read someone with an opinion similar (but quite different) to my own, but some might wonder if a blog turned book is worth investing in.  It is better suited for fans to share with non-fans, with the disclaimer \\"This book attempts to explain just what it is about Godzilla and his movies that I adore so\\" attached.  Recommended for the Kaiju Curious, the fans will be buy it regardless.	2005-08-11

Flags in the Dust], and, in retrospect, is considered the first of the four literary triumphs (As I Lay Dying, Sanctuary and Light in August round out the burst of literary genious) that signaled the arrival a grand new voice in southern writers.  Now how is that for hyperbole?  Cutting through the dense stream of narrative, readers will be rewarded with a harrowing look at a formerly grand southern family dying out.  Not once does the grand matron of the house fail to remind those around her that she was forced to marry beneath her station and that her troubled children are the punishment for doing so.  Each of the three brothers are obsessed with their sister Caddy, albeit for different reasons.  The man child Benjy clearly adores his fallen sister like an angel, the suicide Quentin shared a love with his sister that may or may not have broken a soceital taboo, and the abusive Jason who, having shriveled under the smothering praise of his mother, takes his anger out on everyone around him - especially Caddy's illegitimate daughter, Quentin.  This was the book wherein Failkner's fascination with the death of the Old South and the birth of the New South exploded into brilliance (it was in Sartoris/Flags in the Dust that he discovered the people and the place in which to study).  Highly recommended.	2005-08-09

Pulling a few strings with Dawn's former employer, Chloe manages to get her foster sister's summer job tutoring an emotionally troubled thirteen year old named Nissa.  The list of suspects that could be responsible for Dawn's sudden disappearance is long, and the number one spot is held by Nissa's father, Damian Graylord, a horse breeder fallen on difficult times.  Accidents plague Graylord Pastures and Chloe quickly becomes the focus of them, not to mention Damian's attention as well.  Are they connected?  Ghost Horse is a nice and spooky gothic flavored romance, an excellent way to spend an evening curled up on the couch with a good book.  Recommended.	2005-07-31

Other than the induction of the crazy Sheriff Hoyt (memorably played by R. Lee Emery) into the horror villain pantheon the 30th Anniversary remake of Tobe Hooper's classic The Texas Chainsaw Massacre really did not have much to offer.  It was just another slick and empty slasher movie that resembled the dozens of TCM knock-offs that have cluttered the grindhouses, drive-ins and video rental shelves since the original film's release.  A group of youths (each of a distinct stereotype) are returning from Mexico, via a trip to Dallas to catch a rock concert, when they almost run over a disoriented girl walking in the middle of the road.  The traumatized girl commits suicide in their van and that is only the beginning of the nightmare as they search for help, but only find the persons responsible for putting the delirious-with-fear girl into her final mental state.  There are a few minor differences in the story (mainly Henrietta living alone in the trailer rather than with yet another member of the crazy clan) and an odd anti-meat stance, which basically infers that anyone who delights in the eating of meat is no different than any of the Hewitt's.  Was the term Vegan even around in 1973, when this story is supposed to take place?  I don't recall hearing it until the nineties, at the earliest.  Fans of the movie might enjoy reading this, but it really isn't an improvement on the experience of the film - which wasn't all that to begin with.	2005-07-25

Gonzalez, whose history of pet ownership was spotty and liberally sprinkled with tragedy, wanted a \\"big and macho\\" dog.  Instead he found himself taking home a small Schnauzer/Siberian husky mix that he named Ginny.  As Gonzalez's heart is softened by Ginny's affectionate nature, he discovers that his dog has a special gift - finding and caring for disabled and abused cats.  Man and dog quickly become a team, rescuing and caring for the discarded and forgotten animals littering the neighborhood in which they live.  I fell in love with Ginny myself while reading this inspiring book and highly recommend it to any animal loving reader.	2005-07-22

How is that for hyperbole?  A group of college classmates gathered at the home of their professor dig out a Ouija board from the closet and make contact with a spirit that identifies itself as Butler.  Butler lures them into a hunt for a promised treasure in an isolated mountain area, but what the group actually finds there is a bunch of murdering nutcases.  Laymon makes the insane story work with his tried and true 'real time' narrative that whips out the twists and turns so fast the reader does not have a moment to think about how silly and/or unrealistic most of it is.  The fact that Laymon's characters always come across as believably human and vulnerable helps ratchet up the suspense and, because of this, the final thirty pages are almost unreadable because he has made the reader care so much about them.  While it is no classic, this 1991 novel is still brutal, shocking, frightening AND funny.  In other words, it's Laymon.  Recommended.	2005-07-18

DeCandido makes a game effort at turning Paul W.S. Anderson's shallow script for the first Resident Evil movie (here retitled Resident Evil: Genesis) into an actual story populated with developed characters.  He almost succeeds.  DeCandido has done an admirable job of fleshing out not only the backstories of Alice, Matthew and Spencer, but those of the supporting characters as well.  The backstory stuff does become rather repetitious after awhile, what with all the characters, save one, coming from a military and/or law enforcement background.  Matthew Addison is part of a group that seeks to bring the dirty secrets of the corrupt Umbrella Corporation out into the light of day.  How this group operates and keeps itself funded is kept every bit as secret as the hows and whys of the Umbrella Corporation.  Because of Matthew's history in law enforcement (I guess he is a Rogue-But-Righteous-Cop-Who-Doesn't-Play-By-The-Rules type) he cannot infiltrate Umbrella, but his sister can.  Okay, that is contrived - but SOMEBODY had to fill in the plot holes that Anderson's source 'story' was riddled with.  Lisa, Matthew's sister, is a brilliant computer wiz who manages to get a job inside Umbrella's semi-secret research and development headquarters located beneath the streets of Raccoon City - The Hive.  While Lisa manages to gather some info, she also snags the attention of the center's security chief, Alice Abernathy.  Lucky for Lisa, Alice wants to bring down Umbrella as well.  The two formulate a plan...and that is when things go nightmarishly wrong.  It is also that point where Paul W.S. Anderson's script begins and the novel switches from DeCandido's filling in the blanks to a rather straight forward retelling of the movie in narrative form.  Try as he might, DeCandido, after such a nice build up, could not really keep the smoke and mirrors from distracting this reader from the fact that there is precious little story in Anderson's script.  The oddest thing about the novelization is that, after filling in countless story gaps, DeCandido leaves one empty.  In the film, after dispatching the zombified Lisa, Alice and Matthew share an expository moment.  An instant later they are running for their lives from zombies, the movie not bothering to tell us just how this happened.  Neither does DeCandido, he covers the sloppy transition with a chapter break.  Disappointing oversight.  I can only recommend this novelization to die hard Resident Evil fans.ut the novelization is that, after filling in countless story gaps, DeCandido leaves one empty.

With a title like \\"The Star Stalker\\" any reader familiar with Robert Bloch's work would assume that the book revolved around a psychotic stalking a starlet.  The assumption would be wrong, The Star Stalker is an entirely different kind of book.  It is the story of nineteen year old aspiring screenwriter Tommy Post, who rides a ten or so year long rollercoaster of personal and professional success and failure at the fictional Coronet Studios during the Silent Film Era of early Hollywood. While Tommy manages to live the dream for brief and wonderful moments, the real world constantly intrudes, and Tommy eventually begins to wonder which one is better for him - the comfortable fog of the Hollywood Dream, or the harder, but far more tangible real world.  Robert Bloch steps away from the madmen and monsters and crafts a wonderful little love letter to an era that has slipped into myth - but, despite being written in 1967, Bloch's commentary on the nature of the entertainment business remains just as relevant today as it was nearly forty years ago.  Fans of Bloch and/or Golden Era Hollywood will be rewarded for searching for and reading this almost forgotten book.	2005-06-23

Yet another book given to me by my Church counselor.  While it is full of useful tools for Christian focused parenting I had to giggle at the hopelessly outdated 'Leave It To Beaver' style of dialogue that Priolo passes of as parent/child interaction, \\"Honey, the real problem is that you are too willful...\\", \\"You should desire to please the Lord by honoring and obeying your parents more than you desire to have fun on the weekends as well as during the week.\\"  Trying to find the best manner to instill positive and Godly (i.e. moral) values in a child is one of the most frustrating and difficult responsibilities for any parent.  There are no easy answers or methods, as the labor intensive tools offered in The Heart of Anger show.  The one thing to keep in mind is that it is all about training and educating, not the breaking of the will and rebuilding it in a manner found acceptable.  I can't say how well the book worked for me, but some of the early work is showing some payoff.	2005-06-21

Supreme Chancellor Palpatine has been kidnapped by the Seperatist leader General Grievous and Republic heroes Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi head to the rescue in what promises to be a show stopper of an opening.  But the kidnapping and rescue are just one of the final moves in a intricate game that Darth Sidious (aka Palpatine) has been playing with the Jedi Council from day one.  Or should that be Episode One?  The noose is around the Jedi Council's collective necks and it begins to tighten as Anakin is tempted to follow a dark path to save the woman he loves.  Matthew Stover has done an excellent job breathing life into George Lucas's story and connecting it to other stories in the expanded universe canon.

Gehenna is clearly meant to be what Carter fans would call a 'mythology' episode - meaning a seemingly self-contained story that also uncovers hints and mysteries about the larger conspiracies that drive the show.  What Gehenna reveals is that the mysteries would be edging into spiritual and paranormal areas as well as the more pedestrian Killer of the Week format.  Of the two novelizations published (Millennium 3: Weeds by Victor Koman was never released) Gehenna is the best.  The writing is tight and the source material is better developed than the sketchy ideas sprinkled throughout The Frenchman.  Nonetheless, it remains mostly tease and only devout fans of either Chris Carter or the show (which I am) will want to read the book.	2005-04-27

From George Washington to Ronald Reagan, from C.S. Lewis to Gloria Estefan, Harris uses their life stories and lessons to illustrate how they taught her to better handle the chaos that constantly troubles both ones life and career.  Her only statement about the recount debacle is \\"I followed the law.\\"  That may or may not be true, I do not know enough about the recount controversy to comment, but how she handled the enormous pressure, both personal and political, is inspirational in its humble way.  I finished this book with a greater respect for Katherine Harris than I had when I first cracked it open.  Readers wanting explanations will be disappointed, but those willing to hear a literate chat about the inspirational stories that helped Katherine Harris stay focused and sane during what was probably her most public crisis might enjoy it.	2005-04-26

Tom Sanders comes to work on Monday morning expecting to be rewarded with a profitable promotion as the company he works for merges with another.  Instead Meredith Johnson, a former girlfriend of Sanders, has been given the position.  Making matters worse are the problems with the new line of products.  A production line that Sanders is responsible for.  Meredith schedules an evening meeting with Tom.  During that meeting she becomes sexually aggressive and, after a moment of temptation, Tom leaves.  The next day Meredith claims Tom sexually harassed her.  Humiliated and angered by the fraudulent claim, Tom quickly files a counter and the game of corporate cat and mouse begins as the announcement of the merger draws closer.  But there is a serious problem that Tom is not paying attention to and it is that, not the sexual harassment charge, that could lead to his downfall if he does not catch it in time.  Disclosure is typical Crichton - breathlessly paced, the characterization two-dimensional, at best, and the technical and corporate red herrings have been over simplified to fit into an impossibly tight narrative time frame.  Nonetheless it keeps the reader reading, which is all that pop fiction like this aspires to do.  A diverting read, but far from Crichton's best work.	2005-04-20

When Matheson adapted his novel into a screenplay he toned down the sexual tensions and altered the characterizations a bit.  But the greater freedom of the comic book format allows writer Ian Edington and artist Simon Fraser to keep those tensions and characterizations intact and they let those elements play out without the constraints of a tight budget or an hour and a half running time.<br /><br />Multimillionaire Rudolph Deutsch is dying and he wants hard evidence of survival after death.  To collect this evidence Deutsch hires physicist and parapsychology investigator, not to mention life after death debunker, Dr. Lionel Barrett to investigate the phenomona at the Belasco House.  A place that has earned to title Hell House.  Joining Barrett in the investigation are his assistant wife Edith, Florence Tanner, a mental medium, and Benjamin Fischer, a physical medium and the only survivor of a previous investigation.  Volume One (of Three?) introduces the characters and the Belasco House nicely, the creepy artwork is topnotch and, if the reader is familiar with the movie version, you can almost hear the creepy music that underscored The Legend of Hell House.  I don't think there is a horror fan out there that wouldn't want to have this version of Matheson's frightening story.  Highest recommendation.	2005-04-14

Flush with the success of his show The X-Files, creator/producer Chris Carter branched out into what seemed to be darker territory with Millennium.  Rather than focusing on the paranormal (i.e. UFOs, aliens, and assorted monsters of the week) the new series introduced Frank Black, a man haunted by his ability to literally get into the minds of the serial killers he hunts, and the Millenium Group, a \\"consulting\\" outfit that also seems to function as some kind of secret society.  The monsters of the week were from next door instead of outer space and the tension came from spooky fears of the approaching millenial change rather than government conspiracy and/or cover-up.  The show seemed to have potential, but it never really grasped and explored its good vs. evil structure - despite taking some interesting turns in the second season.  Plot turns that Carter ignored when control of the series returned to him during season three.<br /><br />The Frenchman is a novelization of the premiere episode and, for what it is, it does a professional job of getting the feel of the show down.  The reader will not come away from it with any greater insight into Frank Black, his family, or his new consulting job.  Everything is pretty vague - it is all set-up for later episodes to build and expand upon.  A deranged man is abducting, torturing and then murdering exotic dancers as well as gay men out looking for some companionship.  Criminal profiler Frank Black, having recovered from a paranoid breakdown, has returned with his wife and daughter to their hometown of Seattle and taken a consulting job with the Millennium Group - an organization that appears to help state and county police hunt down localized serial killers.  Black is quick to help an old friend hunt this most recent threat to Seattle.  And that is about it.  Lots of style, but very little substance to go with it.  Then again, it is an attempt to turn a simple hour of television into a full length novel.  With that in mind, it isn't bad for a rainy Saturday afternoon's reading time.ith that in mind, it isn't bad for a rainy Saturday afternoon's reading time.	2005-04-13

The first book in the series, Fantasy Lover, which I have yet to read, does not carry the Dark-Hunter moniker.  Talon, who had a small part in the previous story Night Pleasures, just wants to enjoy a cup of coffee and relax.  But the Daimons gathering for the party madness that is Mardi Gras have different plans.  An attempt to rescue a threatened woman goes wrong, Talon is hit by a passing float, and he awakens in the apartment of the lovely artist Sunshine.  The attraction between the two is impossible to resist.  What the couple do not know is that more than mere lust draws them together.  There is a lot going on in this book, and much of it does not really involve the hero and heroine.  Kenyon is obviously setting up characters for future novels.  While this might distract a tad from what is supposed to be the main focus, the hero and heroine falling in love, it does wet the appetite for future books.  Recommended.	2005-04-10

The mysterious woman survives her fall, but she barely makes inside Community General before Sloan is called to the puzzling scene of an apparent murder.  It seems somebody stuck a knife into the chest of parachuting adrenalin junkie Winston \\"Win\\" Brant, owner/publisher of Thrill Seeker magazine.  Although Mark's detective son Steve would like his brilliant father to focus on the Brant case, Doc Sloan cannot stop thinking about the woman's attempted suicide.  In fact he becomes so fixated that he cannot even sleep, his mind too busy trying to figure out something he cannot bring himself to understand.  What would drive somebody to try and take their own life?  Former Diagnosis Murder writer/producer Lee Goldberg has delivered another fun murder mystery.  He expertly mixes together two seemingly unrelated mysteries with a touching subplot about Dr. Sloan's stubborn smoker that allow for three satisfying endings.  The banter between Sloan, Steve, Jesse and Amanda (DM fans know who they are) is the funniest to date and the characters have really come to life in this new format.  Highly recommended.	2005-03-24

Well, if you read this book, you will come away convinced that it is nothing good.  'Paranormal' Talk Radio legend Art Bell takes a look at the numerous problems that humanity is currently facing and predicts nothing but gloom and doom.  Not unlike what author Whitley Strieber did for Bell's later book, The Coming Global Superstorm, Bell himself narrates fictional stories at the beginning of each chapter to illustrate the best case/worst case scenarios of future developments prior to examining the current issues that could lead to them.  Some seem rather naive, like the one world government and religion, while others seem meant to simply inspire fear.  I know that many groups predict one world government/one world religion, but the state of affairs has only deteriorated in the eight years since Bell wrote the book and the one world scenario looks farther away than ever.  The edition I have was published in 1997 and, as far as I can tell, it has not been reprinted and/or revised.  The biggest problem with the book is its general lack of detail.  Bell hop, skips and jumps from one subject to another without going into anymore than the most general of detail, which allows a lot of wiggle room to use the limited presentation of factual data to prove a point rather than objectively study the issue.  Of course it is the author's hope that the reader will then pick a subject of interest and go out and read more about the subject.  Fans of Bell will enjoy reading the book, but those expecting an in depth study of possible future events will just shake their collective heads and walk away disappointed.	2005-03-18

Though each has their own unique emotional scar from the wounds of their parents divorce, the two figure that if their parents can start over anew, then so can they.  Mackenzie wagers their mother's first wedding ring - she will quit her job and start the candy store that she always wanted to run and, at her wild sister's urging, dump her boring boyfried.  Sabrina, who never stays in one place, or with one man, for any length of time, has to settle down and not sleep with a man unless she truly loves him.  Sabrina thinks a celibate year is asking a bit much, but Mackenzie urges her to satisfy her lusts with chocolate.  Feeling the desire for something more down to Earth than the life she has been living, Sabrina agrees and settles down in New York City, getting a job at Decadence, an upscale restaurant.  What Sabrina did not forsee was Decadence's hunk of a dessert chef, Kristoffer Rex.  The chef has an eye on Sabrina, who plans on eating a lot of chocolate to control her own cravings for Rex.  I hope she has a supply in insulin handy as well!  This was a nice change of pace from the paranormals, futurists and romantic suspense novels I have been reading recently.  I am sure fans of this line of books will enjoy it.  Recommended.	2005-03-13

The original story, adapted by the original author, is told once again.  Following that is an adaptation of an unfilmed script, The Get of Belial, from the second season of Kolchak: The Night Stalker that never was.  The third, and final, reprinted story is Stuart Kaminsky's Fever Pitch.  A mystery about exploding people and the necessity of facing, and not turning away from, your deepest fears.  Closing out this anthology is a short yarn by Stefan Petrucha, wherein the intrepid reporter explains what horror means to him.  Kolchak chronicler Mark Dawdidziak, author of The Night Stalker Companion and an original Night Stalker sequel entitled Grave Secrets, writes an introduction about how nice it is for the Kolchak universe to begin expanding and Kolchak fan and website caretaker Steve Crow closes with some thoughts about what makes Carl Kolchak so very special to his fans.  This collection is a wonderful way to introduce people to Carl Kolchak and no fan will want to be without a copy on their bookshelf.  Highly recommended.	2005-03-10

It seems that the probes we have sent to Mars have irked its inhabitants and they decide to attack first, blasting into oblivion every Earthling they happen upon.  Bud and two surviving companions narrowly escape a gruesome death, running into the surrounding woods.  While the Martians pelt that area with some kind of bioweapons, Bud lead his companions through the woods towards the only nearby shelter, the famous Gelman Mansion.  A rich man's folly, the mansion is an intricate maze of rooms and passageways turned museum (a sort of ficitionalized version of San Jose's famous Winchester Mystery House) where, in a contrived coincedence, Bud used to work as a tour guide.  Once at the mansion Bud and his companions discover another group of survivors.  The Martians in the ship that attacked Bud discover the mansion and send out a small unit to investigate.  Who will survive and what will be left of them?<br /><br />Martian Deathtrap as all the depth one would expect from a book based on a series of trading cards.  In other words, not much.  None of the characters really acts or behaves in a realistic manner and, to be honest, almost all of them are in the story simply to die gruesomely at the hands of the Martian invaders or the insects made giant and deadly by the aliens' bio-weapondry.  The Martians are also comically unaware of Earth customs, so some humor can be found in their lack of understanding the strange environment.  Overflowing with gore and sprinkled with comedy, the book is passable entertainment.  But readers wanting more emotional depth in their alien invaders yarns had better look elsewhere.	2005-03-09

Lansdale, then Bumper Crop's revised one would be The Early Stories of Joe R. Lansdale.  I have been a fan of Lansdale since 1982 or so, back when he was beginning to see regular print in the pages of Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone Magazine -and it is nice to have those short shorts that I remember so clearly (The Dump, Chompers, etc.) finally collected into a book format.  Most of the stories in this collection were written fast, or before Lansdale had discovered, refined, and polished his blackly comic and ruggedly vulgar writing style, so those expecting the artistic heights found in High Cotton will be confused or disappointed.  These are the stories that contained the flickers and hints of the greatness that was growing within Lansdale's writing.  Highly recommended.	2005-03-01

The Dead Beat is one of them.  Larry Fox is a jazz pianist just filling in at a local nightclub when the singer, who is a woman from his criminal past, steps onto the stage.  Larry decides to extort money from her, but only gets roughed up for his trouble and his unconscious body is discovered by Elinor and Walter Harris, a soon to be middle aged couple out celebrating their wedding anniversary.  The kindly couple nursemaid Larry and invite him to stay with them until he recovers.  Larry, sensing that he's found the perfect hideaway from which to attack his former partner, accepts and begins formulting an intricate plan for revenge.  Bloch keeps the pace quick and even tosses in some social commentary that remains relevant to this day and age, despite the book being well over forty years old.  Anything Bloch wrote should be considered required reading for suspense fans.  Recommended.	2005-02-28

They are mentally linked via nanocomputers and can communicate via thought.  But Jake thinks that Cai is a computer, so he is none too pleased when she reveals herself to be a live woman, and a young one at that.  However Cai has a reason for revealing her identity, she wants to go to the Raft Cities to search for her parents, and the upcoming operation to retrieve Banzai Maguire and the son of the UCE's military commander in chief is going to the Raft Cities.  Having the hero and heroine communicate by thought is a nifty concept, and the novel does use it to good effect, but the story is short on the pulse pounding action.  It gets off to an excellent start, with an operation going wrong and Cai handling herself quite well in a back alley brawl, but then it mellows out and just kind of sits there for next few hundred pages.  I probably wouldn't have minded, but the setting echoes the somewhat more action heavy The Shadow Runners a bit, and the need to trust is likewise echoed in Day of Fire.  The book does contain a villain that you will love to hate and enjoy seeing taken down a notch, or three.  It isn't a bad book, it just didn't grip my attention like The Legend of Banzai Maguire and The Shadow Runners did.	2005-02-10

Lansdale - which the term High Cotton symbolizes (its farming parlance for an exceptionally good crop).  Gathered between the covers are 21 terrific stories that show off Lansdale's considerable talent for spinning yarns that can be gruesome (Tight Little Stitches in a Dead Man's Back), funny (Steppin' Out, Summer 68), frightening (Incident On and Off a Mountain Road), and poignant (Not From Detroit), sometimes all at the same time (Drive-In Date).  If you are easily offended by vulgar humor and salty language, not to mention microscopic examinations of the darker aspects of humanity, Lansdale will make for a very tough read.  But stick with him, his stories are worth it.  Highest recommendation.	2005-01-23

After rescuing some priceless artifacts stolen from Iraq (a laughable and tasteless way to get the story rolling), Lara Croft, Tomb Raider, finds herself caught up with yet another dangerous cult.  It seems that someone is trying to resurrect an ancient, proto-religious following called Mene (or The Numbered) and is willing to kill any and all that get in the way of doing so.  What makes the situation personal is that an old friend, Alison \\"Ajay\\" Harfleur, who wanted nothing more than to be exactly like Lara, has fallen in with the reforming Mene.  The Tomb Raider and Ajay's jilted fiance, a mechanical armed behemoth nicknamed Borg, give chase.  Despite the promising concept rooted in Lovecraftian lore, I found this outing a tad slow and wordy, focusing less on the action and more on the character (as opposed to The Amulet of Power, which was all action and NO character development), but it had some cool monsters and an exciting finale, with Croft facing off against a bonafide \\"Deep One.\\"  Tomb Raider fans should enjoy it.

For one, it is the best written book about the Amityville circus that I have read to date (and I have polished off the books by Anson, Holzer, and two by Jones - with only two more to go) and, unlike the others, it is filled with easily verified facts.  Whenever Kaplan sites an article or a particular program, he gives detailed information wherein determined readers would be able to track down the material for themselves.  I have seldom seen this level of honesty in paranormal books before, where most articles seem to be referenced as being in \\"local papers\\" and with independently researchable data kept to a minimum.  I know that detractors like to insult Kaplan, but read the book - his detailed analysis of the escalating differences from the first press conference, to the magazine articles, then to the book (which changed from edition to edition as the 'credible sources' complained at the fictions author Jay Anson attempted to pass off as true events) and then the movie(s) is humorous and show just how easy it is to simply tell a willing audience what it wants to hear.  I doubt very much that an event such as the one in Amityville could be replicated today - though some have tried, because people are going to believe what they want to believe, regardless; and they want to believe in Amityville, demonic pigs, and bogeymen of sorts.  This book is still in print and available from its publisher, Toad Hall Inc, for an affordable price.  Highly recommended to both paranormal and Amityville fans (for whom it should be essential reading).	2005-01-09

Sadly the book fails to bring any dimension to Croft herself, she runs from one adventure to the next without feeling fatigue, hunger, thrist, or any kind of emotion.  This changes at the climax, but it is too little too late.  Still, the book shows that there is plenty of juice left in the franchise.  Fans should enjoy it.	2004-12-10
431787:US	50378566	RQWOSHVN0KNJL	B00005XWP3	41429377	Snowflake	Books	4	15	17	N	N	The life, and the eventual death, of Snowflake.	High in the sky Snowflake is born and then slowly she begins to fall to Earth, but that is just the beginning of her journey.  There are many more miles and forms that she will take before she reaches her journey's final end.  Seemingly aimed at Young Adult readers, the emotionally mature reader will quickly notice that Snowflake's journey is a metaphor for the many joys, pains, and inevitable questions of Life itself.  The heartwarming message that everything serves a design is delivered with, if not subtle, at least beautiful writing.  I had only known Gallico as the writer of The Poseidon Adventure.  I am glad to have discovered this wonderful little book among my late wife's personal belongings.  It soothed me like no book on grief could.  Highly recommended.	2004-12-07

Author Sally Huxley and her husband Bob are just getting settled into their new country home when they find themselves adopted by a sickly stray cat, which the couple eventually name Pip.  How they adjust to their new companion and the interesting adventures they share make for the usual heartwarming collection of Cute Cat Stories that climax with a tragic end, Pip meeting the fate of many an outdoor cat.  Huxley tries a half-hearted pro-and-con argument about whether keeping a cat indoors all the time or letting it out is better or worse.  I am a devout \\"In\\" and Pip's fate is the reason why.  The book, while a little uneven in the linking of cute memories, will undoubtedly warm the hearts, before leaving the inevitable lump in the throat, of its cat loving readers.	2004-12-06

Malcolm Brown and Shirley Seaton cover the events that led to, and followed from, the so-called \\"Christmas Truce\\" of 1914.  In the early months of the great war, the trench lines had become, more or less, set and the enemy soldiers were close enough to speak to one another.  The lengthy stalemate led to increased communication in some areas and, on Christmas Eve, to offers of a truce.  In other words, \\"We won't shoot if you don't.\\"  Soon soliders from both sides were mingling, exchanging gifts, taking photos, and helping one another bury the dead.  The authors let the soldiers speak for themselves as to what the Truce meant from a contemporary, emotional, and/or political standpoint and this objectivity gives the book added weight.  An excellent reminder of the true humanity that is within us all, every one, and excellent Christmastime reading.  Recommended.	2004-12-05

Despite having a premise ripe for either satire or metaphor, the monster on the loose novel Sleeper just does what every other monster on the loose novel does, albeit slightly better than average in some departments.  The premise mixes elements from Lincoln Child & Douglas Preston's novel Relic with Peter Benchley's White Shark and sets them in the Pentagon.  The book could have been set anywhere for all the meaning the location brings the story, but the characters are well developed.  You have Ed Jeffers (the Brody character), the \\"Mayor\\" of the Pentagon and who is the first to discover the beast, Dr. Andrea Deluca (the Hooper character), the lovely scientist that also creates some romanitc tension between the two male heroes, and Terrill \\"Terror\\" Hodge (the Quint character), the adrenaline junkie Navy SEAL sent in to fight the beast.  Sleeper is a quick read, but, in the end, there is nothing in it to separate it from the monster pack.	2004-11-30

The temporary comfort that editor Tony Vincenzo offered reporter Carl Kolchak at the end of Pain Most Human (the sixth book in Moonstone's Kolchak: The Night Stalker series) has rotted away.  Sitting in a bar, the newshound is mulling over the lousy, worthless direction his life has undergone.  Then a special young lady sits with him and encourages Kolchak to tell his story.  Tell it he does, unburdening all the pain he has locked up within him.  He cannot believe the change that comes over him afterwards.  Then visitors come calling for the young lady and the tale takes a turn towards the dark.  A direct follow up to the torture laden Pain Most Human, Pain Without Tears is the perfect balancing yarn.  Its subtle and melancholic message of hope echoes that found in the story Kyrie (Moonstone's Kolchak comic series, Issue #2) and gives the always kicked around Kolchak a reason to continue his lonely path, though the price he pays seems, at first, far too high.  Highest recommendation, but read Pain Most Human first, to understand the true depth of Kolchak's inner pain.	2004-11-27

Lansdale And Timothy Truman's On the Far Side with Dead Folks	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Take a wild ride to the far side of the Cadillac Desert...	and hang with the Dead Folks!  On the Far Side with Dead Folks is a faithful adaptation of Joe Lansdale's classic zombie story On the Far Side of the Cadillac Desert with Dead Folks.  It is vintage Lansdale, vulgar, funny, and, odd as it sounds, achingly humane.  A mixture of the Romero Mythos (the original story was written for the anthology The Book of the Dead) and pulp men's adventure yarn, Dead Folks tells the tale of a tough bounty hunter that captures one bad dude, only to run into a crazy cult on the way back to collect his reward.  Things get a bit complicated after that.  Of all the Lansdale adaptations that Avatar has done, Dead Folks gets my vote as the best.  Highly recommended to Lansdale fans.	2004-11-27

It's been too long since Canada's borders were sealed to stop the viral outbreaks that terrorists had unleashed upon the country from spreading around the globe.  When Mountie Day Daniels' partner is brutally murdered during an investigation, the last thing she wants is a partner interfering with her.  But Lian Firebird is not an ordinary partner. He is a plague hunter, and suddenly he is in charge of the case because of the threat of a new outbreak the murder uncovers.  The chase is on to catch the virus before it destroys the chance to open Canada's borders once again.  Day of Fire is a somber tale set in a bleak future and its lacks the pulpy energy of the premiere book in the 2176 series.  There just wasn't enough fire to hold my interest for long periods of reading time.	2004-11-26

This book was given to me by a friend that was trimming down her library, and a more fitting book it could not have been.  Editors Vincent Price (yes, THAT Vincent Price) and Chandler Brossard (no, not THAT Chandler Brossard) have gathered together some of Poe's finest tales of horror, mystery, and fantasy, with a comedy or two thrown in for balance.  Poe's horror stories were, for the most part, short and placed emphasis on the pyschological rather than the mystical.  His narrators were always driven by inner demons that they recognized, but could not control, and focused on emotion rather than story.  The Black Cat and The Tell-Tale Heart are the most famous examples of these.  But the author also used his sharp insight into the mind to craft brilliant tales of mystery, it is these tales that remain my favorite.  The Murders in the Rue Morgue and The Gold Bug are my choices for Poe's best work, the mystery The Purloined Letter is also contained within the anthology.  On the fantasy end, we are offered A Tale of the Ragged Mountains and MS Found in a Bottle, which seems to be a sort of a dry run for Poe's only attempt at a novel length story - The Narrative of A. Gordon Pym.  Poe also had a wicked sense of humor, and The System of Dr. Tarr and Prof. Fether, The Man That Was Used Up, and The Balloon-Hoax are excellent examples of that alomst forgotten side of a complex and talented writer.  No matter what edition of Poe you get, any collection of his tales is an essential for a well read personal library.  Highest recommendation.	2004-11-13

How would they fly, why would they hoard gold, and how did they breed?  Author Peter Dickinson attempts to answer these question from the standpoint that Dragons were very much real and, step-by-step, he explains how these meat-eating Hindenburgs would have lived.  His viewpoint is that they were animals, and not 'intelligent beings', but, real or not, fire breathing dragons have left a mark in our minds and memories that remains to this modern day.  Another plus are the nice dragon illustrations peppering the slim, 132 page coffee table styled book, so fantasy fans will find something to enjoy in it.	2004-11-12
459357:US	50378566	R1D39BUS7ACG3E	0671785117	154415240	Zero Hour (Resident Evil Series, Book 0)	Books	4	7	11	N	N	Is this really how it all began...?	Because the story, such as it is, doesn't make a lick of sense.  The timeline starts just as Raccoon City's S.T.A.R.S. Bravo Team (the one that Alpha Team was sent to rescue in the very first Resident Evil game story) flies into the forest to investigate the series of murders that have happened there.  What they find, after some helicopter trouble, is an overturned MP jeep with two dead passengers and a missing convict, then rookie member Rebecca Chambers discovers a seemingly deserted train.  But there is a sinister plan behind all the destruction, and Chambers, along with the escaped convict Billy Coen, get caught up in it.  The Spencer Mansion makes a cameo, as does Albert Wesker, William Birkin and Alexander Ashford, but the attempted connections to the proceeding game stories these events supposedly set-up seem forced.  It would have worked better as a simple sequel rather than a prequel.  Another disappointment is how slim the writing is this time around.  S.D. Perry has crafted some wonderfully entertaining Resident Evil novels, both adaptations and original stories, but she seems to add very little shading this time around.  Then again, it appears that she was given very little material to work with from the start.  Yes the book is an exciting read (I would rate it three and a half stars), but after the solid work she had done in novels past this, her seventh Resident Evil book, is a tad weak.  I hope there can be more original novels from her in the future, and not just the to be expected novelization of Outbreak.	2004-11-11

While Dr. Sloan is relaxing at his beach front home, trying to paint the seascape view, four gunshots pierce the silence.  He rushes to scene of the crime, which happens to be a house or two down the street, and finds a man and a woman evidently shot during a moment of passion.  But something is not quite right with the blood spatter and Dr. Sloan begins to investigate, that's when the police arrive and the trouble begins.  Making matters worse is the new administrator at Community General.  The man seems to have some personal vendetta against Dr. Sloan.  Author Lee Goldberg again mixes likable characters with a nifty mystery (more of a howdunnit than a whodunnit this time around) and pulls another entertaining book from the creative oven.  Diagnosis Murder fans will no doubt be eager for more, recommended.	2004-11-07

Authors Susan Moon and Susie Tracy tell how a stray cat adopted them just in time to shelter her litter.  They soon discover that one of the cats is deaf.  Each of the cats, Mama Toot, Pickering, Mocha, Percy, and Pretty Lady (soon shortened to Pritt), gets a heartwarming moment to share with the reader.  Not surprisingly, Pritt the deaf cat takes up the most narrative space - this is due to her condition causing unique behavior and training.  A wonderful blend of coo inducing photos and adorable cat stories, highly recommended to young cat lovers everywhere.	2004-11-07

I first read I Don't Want to Talk About It when it debuted in the late 90s and my feelings were mixed.  Relating to it was difficult, but I was sliding from covert to overt depression with little understanding or help about what exactly I was going through.  Seven or so years later, overwhelmed with grief and depression at the sudden and unforseen death of my wife of 13 years, a friend gave me the book as a helpful present.  I was hesitant to reread it, but I am glad I finally cracked it open.  Being a little older and wiser, I have a better understanding of the points that Real is making and can see certain problems I have more clearly.  With the darkness past, I can recommend this book for people who wonder why mean compulsively do what they do and how, with effort, it can be changed for the better.  Recommended.	2004-11-04

Matt Stone does not believe in ghosts, and he detests those that do, seeing them only as money grubbing con-artists.  But something is happening at Melody House, the historic Stone family estate.  While his friends and co-workers think that it's ghosts (which would be a boom for the tour business) Matt believes that it is decidely human in origin.  Enter Darcy Tremayne, a psychic ghost hunter sent by her employer (who happens to be an old friend of the Stone family) to investigate and find out if it's a haunting or a humbug.  What Darcy uncovers is a little of both.  Haunted is an uneven book, the romance is underdeveloped, but I enjoyed the spooky stuff that surrounded it.  Not a complete failure, but it falls short of being a truly rewarding read.	2004-10-23

Halloween is my favorite time of the year, so this book was a welcome addition to my library.  It works best as a simple introduction to the history of this maligned cultural event (which has nothing whatsoever to do with dark and evil forces) and as an idea maker for recipes (two of which I plan to test at an upcoming party) and spells (if you are into that magic scene, I am not).  I also hope to try out the Passion Pumpkin Dinner (minus the mumbo jumbo) at some point in the future, because it sounds so deliciously romantic.  My only wish is that I could have tried it with my late wife - I think she would have loved it.  I thought the book got a tad dull when it started its litany of spells, which I've already said is not my thing, so it did not interest me, and I just scanned over it.  The speaking to the dead segment also offered some comfort, all my 'thinking out loud' and speaking to my deceased wife's pictures is normal and healthy, and maybe she hears it, I don't know.  I do know that if you like Halloween, you will find much to enjoy in this book.	2004-10-19

Or so everybody thinks.  It turns out that the man was dead before the shark had him for lunch, so why was he murdered?  The answer is a surprise, and how Dr. Sloan chases down the murderer makes for a satisfying mystery read.  While The Silent Partner read more like a novelization of unused scripts for Diagnosis Murder, The Death Merchant reads like an actual novel.  Even those unfamiliar with the show and its characters will enjoy it.  Good stuff and highly recommended.	2004-10-17

Months behind shooting schedule and millions over budget, would JAWS actually do well enough to make a profit?  That was the question raised prior to the film's release, long before it became a box office juggernaut (the first film to earn over 100 million at the box office) and pop culture phenomenon.  It is also the question that, more or less, closes this look at the hilariously chaotic and nightmarish shoot that was JAWS, for the book was written after filming had wrapped and before the finished product was unleashed on unsuspecting theatre goers.  With no stars (Quint had yet to be cast), no script and no schedule, the production team from Universal took over the island of Martha's Vineyard to film the adaptation of Peter Benchley's best-selling shark thriller.  Rather than a glossy studio backed 'Making of' book, Blake (who refers to herself as the Girl Photographer in the narrative) takes the outsider Islander few of the insanity that is movie making.  The result is a more unvarnished look at the movie's production (though it is hard to tell one local from the other).  Fans of Jaws will find this chapter on the production saga essential reading.	2004-10-14

Lee Goldberg was the perfect choice to write the first in what now appears to be a successful series of whodunnits inspired by the long running television show Diagnosis Murder, which starred Dick Van Dyke as Dr. Mark Sloan.  Goldberg served as both writer and producer of the show for several years, so his ear for dialogue and the visual rhythm of the series is spot on.  The Silent Partner offers the reader two mysteries, one involving a serial killer (and which provides the book's title), the other a patient death at Community General.  Fans of the show will enjoy it and hopefully it will become a mystery section standard, like Murder, She Wrote.	2004-10-02

The remaining tales are a mixed bag of Cold Era thrillers (View by Moonlight and The Odor of Melting), crime and suspense stories (Coyote Street, The Pattern, and The Income Tax Mystery) and old fashioned whodunnits (There Hangs Death! and The Affair of the Twisted Scarf).  Nonetheless, it contains a pretty impressive sampling of familiar names - Rex Stout, Bill Pronzini, Edward Hoch, and Joseph Payne Brennan, to name but a few.  Fans of the Alfred Hitchcock and Ellery Queen Mystery Magazines will enjoy these old chestnuts.	2004-09-18

Tori agrees, but the subject, one Grady Palmer, quickly finds the pretty lass on his tail and confronts her. The best excuse for following him that Tori can come up with is 'I think you're hot!'  Well, Grady is. But he is also very suspicious of his pretty little follower, so he plays along, hoping to find out who is looking into him and why. Add one ugly cat, a cranky landlady, and a set of twins stretching the terrible twos into the threes and you have a winner. Highly recommended.	2004-07-25

When Lacey Garrett takes a moment to answer a message board poster's question, she has no clue that doing so will soon have her teleported to another planet.  Zain Masters believed that he had been scouting a simple, out of the way world.  Then a hidden laser shot his ship out of the sky.  Lacey is the only person who seems to understand the strange markings on a local monument.  Markings that seem to hold the key to a way out of his situation.  But something dangerous lurks beneath the surface.  Barry's third book in the Un series is a fun adventure/romance, but the planet hopping plotlines of the previous entries is missing this time out.  Lacey and Zain spend most of the novel in one place, a desert planet the Warrior Programmer dubs Death Valley.  Despite the lack of world building diversity Barry's story is a delight to read.  Highly recommended.	2004-07-14

Lansdale was forced to put his ailing mother in a rest home.  The writer found the place both sad and creepy...and a wonderful setting for a story.  Combining two fallen heroes from his youth (Elvis Presley and President John Kennedy) with an interest in archeology (i.e. mummies) Lansdale drafted the story Bubba Ho-Tep, wherein the eldery men who may or may not be who they say they are (the aforementioned misters Presley and Kennedy) battle a soul sucking mummy that is feeding on the frail residents of the rest home they live in.  Lansdale's story is sad, spooky, funny, and ulitmately heartwarming as the two find themselves vitalized by the battle with a nemesis that only they can see and touch.  Ironically, Lansdale did not care much for the story and was surprised when it became a fan favorite.  He was also stunned that Phantasm writer/director Don Coscarelli wanted to make the story into a movie.  Considering how oddball the concept was, it is no surprise that financing Bubba Ho-Tep would prove problematic.  But Coscarelli stuck to his vision and snagged Bruce Campbell and Ossie Davis to star and managed to make the movie he wanted to make.  When no one would distribute it, he distributed it himself and a bona-fide cult classic was born.  In this book are Lansdale's story and Coscarelli's respectfully faithful shooting script.  Whether you are a fan of Lansdale, Coscarelli, or Campbell (or all of the above, like me) this book is required reading.  Highly recommended.	2004-05-31

As most fans of Art Bell and Whitley Strieber know, this is the book that inspired Roland Emmerich to write and direct The Day After Tomorrow.  For that reason alone it is a must read for any disaster movie/novel fanatic.  Bell and Strieber use a combination of myth interpretation, amatuer and/or pseudo-science speculation and fictional dramatization of the actual prophesied event to educate/scare the reader with their theory that a single and quite massive 'superstorm' might bring about either a new ice age or global flood.  Whichever it might be depends on what time of year the storm is unleashed on an unsuspecting world.  Some of the examples sited are a tad suspect.  I am fairly certain that Carl Sagan debunked the moon-is-a-broken-off-part-of-Earth theory way back when Cosmos was a first run television series and, while each culture may have a flood myth, this does not necessarily mean that a global flood occurred.  Just about every region of the world will flood at some point or another and it is a long stretch to imply that the myths are linked to a single event.  The less said about the use of an astrological calender, the better.  Nonetheless, if you are as big a fan of Mrrs. Bell and Strieber as I am, then you will probably find this book an entertaining 'what-if' piece of infotainment, but I remain a 'wait and see' skeptic in regards to whether or not said superstorm actually exists.	2004-05-16

Then comes the Halloween night when he does the story on the baby born without a brain...and, returning home from a cooling off period after a fight about the story, Robert plunges into a nightmare where reality and myth become one.  While In Silent Graves is undoubtedly a literate piece of dark fantasy writing (the layering of stories and literary references reminded me of Peter Straub's work), the book just wasn't that scary or unsettling to me.

Neal Darden only wanted to avoid getting into trouble by staying off the main road as he crossed town to return the videos he and his girlfriend had just watched.  Then he hears a woman scream for help, and the nightmare begins.  Grabbing the gun he keeps concealed in his car, Neal runs to the rescue, shooting the assailant.  But he and the potential victim fail to check the body to see if the attacker is, in fact, actually dead.  In gratitude for saving her life, the woman gives Neal a special bracelet that allows the person wearing it to slip into another person's body and mind.  Then things go bad.  The attacker is still alive and, after Neal has left, he finishes his job and starts coming after Neal.<br />Believe me, the book sounds better than it reads.  Laymon, as he does in most of his books, has the story run in 'real time' and it bogs down in the middle with a plot twist that seems to exist just to add kinky sex to the mix of the story.  Even worse, the characters act in the best interest of advancing the plot, not in exploring realistic human behavior in unrealistic circumstances.  Laymon fans will enjoy it, but readers new to the late author will wonder what the loyal following is all about.	2004-04-08

Neal Darden just wanted to avoid trouble and get his video rentals back to the store on time.  But his short cut turns out to be a direct path to terror.  Hearing a woman's scream for help, Darden grabs his concealed weapon and charges to the rescue, blasting the twisted assailant away with the aforementioned gun.  The rescued damsel is very, very grateful, but reluctant to call the cops.  Instead Neal takes her home and, after getting cleaned up, she bestows upon him a gift.  A bracelet that allows the person wearing it to enter into the body and mind of others, without their knowing it.  Then things go crazy.  The attacker isn't dead, nor is he finished, and, as far as Neal goes, anything that can go wrong, does.  Body Rides is filled with the kinky sex (not to mention Laymon's almost festishistic fascination with voyeurism), brutal violence and black comedy that the late, great writer was famous (or infamous, depending on who you talk with) for, but it also drags with unneeded detail which robs the middle part of suspense.  Some of the characters also behave in a way that is great for the plot, but just doesn't jibe with human nature.  At least with the nature of the humans I have known.  But when the novel cooks, it is a fun ride.	2004-04-05

Mark Dawidziak, author of all things Kolchak (a series companion, an original novel, AND a comic book adventure), collects together, for the first time anywhere, the three teleplays written by Richard Matheson that introduced the world to the rumpled reporter hero that is Carl Kolchak.  The first is an adaptation of The Night Stalker, the story that started it all.  A serial killer is stalking Las Vegas.  One who only attacks at night and drains the blood from his victims.  When Kolchak finally sees the killer effortlessly escape from the police, he figures out that it isn't someone who thinks he is a vampire.  The killer IS one!  Matheson's final script differs a bit from what actually made it to the television screen (this includes an entirely different take on the ending) because Jeff Rice, the author of the first Kolchak novel, was called in to do some rewrites.  The Night Strangler was the 'rushed' sequel to the ratings blockbuster.  The comfortably similar yet all new mystery with the returning favorites (Kolchak and his always suffering, yet oddly supportive, editor, Tony Vincenzo) and a cast of lively newcomers shows all the hard work that Matheson put into a story that was almost impossible for him to write.  Considering how hard the second script was, it comes as no surprise that screenwriting chores were shared with William F. Nolan for The Night Killers, the third and unproduced Kolchak movie.  It is this funny and suspense filled mystery (featuring aliens and robots) that makes the anthology worth it - for it finally gives Night Stalker fans the chance to see the Kolchak adventure that never was.  To me it is the best script of the bunch, with Matheson so completely comfortable with the characters that you can hear/see McGavin and Oakland going through the paces while Nolan crafts a first rate mystery that takes them in new directions.  The third time was the charm and, considering the high standards set with the previous installments, that is saying a lot.  No Kolchak fans should be without this.  Highest recommendation.t is saying a lot.  No Kolchak fans should be without this.  Highest recommendation.	2004-03-24

Her battle scars, however, necessitate regular virgin sacrifices to keep her skin fresh and healthy.  If she doesn't do this she starts to breakdown, literally.  All is well, considering, until her quiet life as a tarot card reader/psychic counselor is disrupted by a rash of missing husbands.  A friend of her latest sacrifice starts sniffing around as well.  All this sounds like good thriller material, but it is wasted in a haze of poorly sketched characters and fuzzy narrative.  I had a hard telling telling the wives apart - they all seemed alike, perhaps it was intentional on some artistic level, for Ashley (the sacrifice's on-the-prowl-and-searching-for-clues best friend) is fully developed.  The story unfolds with dream logic, but this hampers any emotional connection with the events and don't get me started on the pages wasted focusing on one wife's dabbling with a New Age group and mulling over whether or not to drink her own urine (a meaningless subplot that goes nowhere).  Events proceeding those in the novel are mentioned, making me think that this is a sequel or continuing 'series'.  If it is, I have little interest in reading any others.  A real disappointment.	2004-03-14

Barry's first novel, Unearthed, was so much fun I wondered if she would be able to maintain or slip into the dreaded sophomore slump.  She did not, Unraveled is a winner through and through.  Tru Van Dye has spent most of her life working her father's projects at the Majj Institute (a think tank that gifts the galaxies with life saving and/or improving inventions, or so she thinks) that she has little time to build her own, and time is running out.  Tru has to come up with a discovery that she believes will earn her a Charter (the right to continue to live at the Institute) or face being forced out.  She has a key, but needs help in finding the lock.  That help is Rayce Coburne, a former treasure acquisitioner trying to build his own space port, but time and money are running out.  Tru offers him plenty of money, but can Rayce over come his hatred of the Majj to help her?  Again Barry mixes the best elements of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Star Wars (Quest, Paranormal Artifacts, Good vs Evil on the galactic scale with plenty of fascinating worlds to visit) with humor and a first rate romance.

No comments from cast, production crew, or composer Jerry Goldsmith are offered.  Those (like me) expecting an in depth look at the making of a genre milestone will be a tad disappointed.  Nonetheless, the countless conceptual drawings (both for used and unused concepts) from the pre-production of the motion picture and the generous amounts of stills will get the mouth of any Alien fan watering.

Just about everybody thinks that Melany Jackson is coming apart at the mental seams after the death of her child in an automobile accident.  A midnight visit to the graveyard where her daughter is buried would have been the last straw, but the coffin is empty.  Has there been some terrible mistake, or is something far darker going on?  Ryan Braxton has left the FBI for the Colby Agency.  The former agent was both tired of the heartache of looking for missing and exploited children and devastated by Melany's walking out on him two years ago.  When an old partner calls him in to help discover whether Melany's child is either truly dead or missing, he doesn't want to help.  The idea that Melany would so quickly find someone else and have a child is painful to consider.  What Ryan doesn't know and Melany is afraid to admit is that the missing girl is in fact Ryan's daughter.  Cries in the Night is a solid little suspense tale.  It kept me guessing and turning the pages, hoping that the missing girl would be okay and eager to find out just what was going on and who was truly behind it all.  Recommended.	2004-02-23

Over time I have wondered if the review I had written for this book (under its Amityville II: The Possession tie-in release) was a tad too harsh.  So, with my occasional interest in the paranormal currently going through a resurgence, I decided to track it down and read it again.  The book's kooky logical illogic (or should it be illogical logic?) still befuddles my mind.  Dr. Holzer starts off with a supposed historical look at the phenomenon of possession (a term for an outside personality inhabiting and controlling another person's body), but his explanations and extrapolations are hampered both by the use of two fictious examples of possession and his outright ignoring the obvious fact that mental illness was perceived as 'possession' in older times.  Following his explanation are chapters filled with court transcripts that Holzer tries to present as evidence that DeFeo is/was possessed.  All it showed to me was that the young man was clearly troubled and a ticking time bomb of repressed anger and violence.  After two chapters of lawyer, police, witness, expert, and defendant Q&amp;A (which ends with DeFeo being found guilty and sent to prison for 150 years) Holzer shifts gears back to paranormal research, relating a trip made to the house by him and a trance medium.  The medium's reading of the house's spiritual inhabitants differs a great deal from what the Lutz's say they experienced and her visions of tragedy don't reflect the tragedy that befell the DeFeo's all that much either.  Further casting doubt on her abilities is how she gives an incorrect tribal name to the supposed violent native american spirit that haunts the house.  The tribe is not one with any historic connections to, or in, the region.  After 288 pages of court transcripts, interviews, and psychic hooey, the true crime facts do not connect with the paranormal 'findings' and thus leave Holzer's claims of possession without any factual merit.  The only reason the book gets two stars is that it does feature large portions of court transcripts that show how the police were able to unravel Butch DeFeo's weak story.  Outside of that, the book has nothing of interest for either true crime buffs or those fascinated with the paranormal, or both.does feature large portions of court transcripts that show how the police were able to unravel Butch DeFeo's weak story.

Both the primary love story, between Genevieve and Jack(son), and the subplot romance, between Genevieve's mom Annabelle and the recently divorced Matt Murphy, seem to be given nearly equal amounts of word time and, sad to say, I found myself liking the subplot far more than the primary.  It just came out as a bit more mature than the erotic fantasy disguised as romance that is supposed to be the main selling point (Nerd winds up on supposedly deserted island with Hot Chick).  One point that did not sit well with me was the rather unromantic way Genevieve and Jack get together.  Having a woman offer the guy to 'practice' sex with her is something better suited for an adult movie than it is a romance novel.  Do guys really want to fall in love with someone like that and raise a family with them?  I don't think so and I hope others share my opinion.  Come to think of it, Matt also gets some pity nooky tossed his way, from a waitress named Celeste, early in the book.

Moonstone has yet another feather for the straw hat of its Kolchak: The Night Stalker line.  Once again they have captured the flavor of the series, bringing in the news room regulars (Ron Updyke, Miss Emily, and, of course, Tony Vincenzo) for comic relief and the monster Carl battles this time is arguably the best one yet.  Another nice touch is the continuity and the growing frustration Kolchak is beginning to show with constantly running into the creatures of the night.

Yet again Moonstone has captured the magic - Lambs to the Slaughter is a nifty and, for once, well thought out mystery filled with all the suspense, humor, and banter of the television series.  It also expands nicely on the characters of Tony and Carl, revealing further depth to their personalities and their relationship with each other.  Even better is how Kolchak's noble streak really shows itself in this outing.  As Darren McGavin once said, he is a true American hero.  Highly recommended.	2004-02-14

Moonstone's second Kolchak: The Night Stalker graphic novel is based on an unproduced script for the show's never to be second season.  When the series was cancelled the scripts were shelved.  Now fans can get an idea of the shows that might have been if Kolchak: The Night Stalker had been allowed a second season.<br />Carl is sent to West Virginia (Winship County to be exact) to cover a tension filled strike at a local mine.  When the mine owner is savagely murdered the Sheriff thinks that it might be a few strike frustrated miners working out their differences in a more brutal fashion.  But the type of wounds don't hint at a beating, it's more like a mauling.  When two more people are murdered, Kolchak begins to dig a bit deeper and what he uncovers is an evil far older than that of mere mankind.<br />Again Moonstone shows a clear understanding of the tone, character, and stories that have made Kolchak: The Night Stalker such a cult favorite.  The visuals are almost photographic in capturing the look of the series and thedialog rings true.  These adaptations and original stories are essential for any Kolchak fan.  Highly recommended.	2004-02-10

An LC (futurist term for prostitute) is murdered in the flamboyant style of Jack the Ripper, which is bad.  But the unknown killer leaves a personal note for Lieutenant Eve Dallas, which is even worse.  When the serial killer strikes again, it is not as Jack the Ripper, but as The Boston Strangler.  Another note is left and Dallas and her associates race against time to figure out who is so meticulously copycatting the infamous serial killers of old.  This is the first 'In Death' book I have read and it most certainly will not be the last.  The mystery is good, with enough red herrings to keep the pages turning, but, sadly, the front cover offers more than a bit of a spoiler.  The secondary characters are likable and, in the end, I looked forward to spending time with them again...another fan won over.  Recommended.	2004-02-09

Even thirty years later Jeff Rice's concept of a seasoned newspaper reporter facing down a real honest to goodness vampire has lost none of its freshness, and down on his luck reporter Carl Kolchak remains an inspired creation.  This adaptation of the novel reads like a cliff notes version of the tv movie also based on the novel (albeit with some spicier subject matter) and I found myself wishing that more time had been spent developing the characters...would a two-parter adaptation been asking too much?  That quibble aside (and yes, the binding on the book could have been much, much better) this is an essential addition to every Kolchak fan's collection.  Kolchak lives!	2004-02-05

Gathered in this book are the behind the scenes stories from those that were there of the making of one of the horror genre's truly legendary films and its sequels (with a passing, and mostly negative, mentioning of the 2003 remake).  Author Stefan Jaworzyn lets the participants speak for themselves in almost uncommented upon interview clippings (he does step in clarify some details or to just share his unneeded opinion).  The result is a far clearer glimpse at director Tobe Hooper (who gets a chapter of his own) and the trendsetting thriller he directed back in 1973.  Hooper (who appears via interview clippings from other sources) comes across as an extremely talented man hampered with bad business skills and even worse luck in choosing who he does business with.  Those he worked with mostly come across as an intelligent bunch of plain old folks completely caught off guard by the powerful little movie they worked on.  The first TCM had a notoriously bad shoot and what happened afterward (in terms of the shafting by the film industry received by all) was a sad foreshadowing of what was to befall Tobe Hooper over the next thirty years.  History more or less repeated itself with each sequel, though only the Tobe Hooper directed one receives truly in depth treatment.  The chapter on Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3 is tantamount to Cliff Notes and largely repeats the information from the DVD extras with nothing added.  Kim Henkel's The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (or TCM: The Next Generation, depending on which video you get) is slightly more in depth, but the 'discussion' of the (at the time of writing) remake is two pages of psychic arm chair criticism that, in light of the film's box office success, seems overly harsh and a tad immature.  Nonetheless, everything that is Saw is revealed, discussed, and shared and no fan of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and/or its sequels and remake will want to be without it.  Highly recommended to those who proclaim the Saw as part of their family.m the Saw as part of their family.	2004-02-02

When Geneva McBride awakens in the afterlife she is certain she is headed for the Big Barbeque, but the Big Man upstairs deems to give her a second chance.  To earn her wings Geneva only has to make sure that the amnesia victim Jonah McBride finds in his restaurant fills the gaping hole Geneva's desertion left in his and their infant daughter's life.<br />I had more than a little problem with Jonah so willingly taking in a woman he doesn't know and allowing her to believe that they are husband and wife and that Jonah's infant daughter is her own.  Being someone who has lost his wife in roughly the same time period as Jonah (she passed away four months ago, so the book's timeline encompasses this past month so to speak) I find his rebounding with another woman so soon to be an incredible stretch of human emotion (whether the marriage was troubled or not is irrelevant), but the fantasy aspect helped it go down a bit easier.  If those elements had not been in the book I would not have been able to read it.<br />But as the story progressed it quickly drew me in.  I found myself both wanting to know who Angel was and dreading the moment when she discovered the good intentioned lie she has been allowed to live.  When the inevitable moment happens, it is nicely handled.  I stayed up late to finish it and, when it was over, I didn't want it to be.  Recommended.	2004-01-26

This entry in the reborn Kolchak: The Night Stalker starts off with a bang, literally.  An old woman steps into an ice cream shop and promptly explodes in front of the owner, who turns away because he then sees a werewolf leaping out of the woman.  No surprise that that little tidbit snatches the attention of reporter Carl Kolchak, who happens upon the scene.  The mystery becomes more gruesome when the ice cream shop owner explodes in front of someone a day or so later.  Obviously something very odd is happening around Los Angeles.<br />Fever Pitch does a credible job of capturing the flavor of the cult TV show (and it follows the contemporizing that Mark Dawdiziak did in his Kolchak novel Grave Secrets - placing the series characters in Los Angeles).  Kolchak still has a hard time making those around him believe the outlandish stories he runs across with regularity and the humor of the show is retained.  My only complaint is that the monster is poorly thought out and the explanation given (while certainly unique) is nowhere near clear enough to satisfy.  Nonetheless, the characters still look and act the way they did on the show and fans will certainly want this in their collections.  I know I did.  Kolchak lives!	2004-01-20

Jones' second Amityville book is a marked improvement over his first, the silly and way over the top The Amityville Horror II.  This time out Jones tells of how the Lutz's and those close to them (including himself) came under supernatural attack during the release and publicity tour for the film version of Jay Anson's book.  Whether such outlandish tales are actually true or not I will leave up to the beliefs of individual readers, but I think the reason Jones opts for a novel style narrative to capture the feeling of the attacks is because the supporting characters are as fictional as the events that befall them.  It would be nice to have some corroborative evidence of these events taking place (photos, medical or repair bills and/or invoices, interviews with doctors, etc), but none is offered.  There is also very little actual story or character information between attacks, so the 'story' itself is overly fragmented at best.  But some scenes were entertaining, such as Dr. Quentin Cosmos arrival at the Lutz home (a scene that has a passing resemblance to Julian Beck's arrival at the Freeling home in Poltergeist II: The Other Side, which was made a year or two after this book was released) and a babysitter's run in with some men (and a woman) in black.  The title is also a bit of a fib.  Jones followed this 'Final Chapter' with two more books - 'The Horror Returns' and 'The Evil Escapes'.  Taken as entertainment, Amityville: The Final Chapter is passable stuff (in other words, you can give it a pass, other books are far scarier), but as a work of non-fiction reporting it truly fails, for it is sorely lacking in credibility.  While the Lutz's may believe themselves, they offer nothing to help me believe them.	2004-01-19

Aaron Allston closes out the X-Wing Series with this stand alone novel that has Wedge Antilles and his team of sarcastic wingmen off to play diplomat.  The plan is to encourage the neutral world of Adumar to join the New Republic.  What they discover is that Adumar is only one or two civilized steps above utter barbarism, with starfighters routinely killing each other in needless honor duels.  Making matters worse is the arrival of Imperial delegates wishing to woo Adumar over to the Empire and a New Republic diplomat that believes that any means are justified by the end (i.e. getting Adumar into the New Republic).  I'm not the most well read Star Wars fan, so some of the plot lines mentioned early on left me going, huh?  But when the novel gets cooking it becomes a tasty adventure with all the epic battles one has come to expect from this galaxy far, far away.	2004-01-09

Leon &quot;Whitey&quot; Thompson shares his experiences serving time in what is undoubtedly one of America's most (in)famous prisons, Alcatraz aka The Rock.  To better put his time and personality changes there in a clear perspective, Thompson also tells of his tortured childhood at the hands of an abusive alcoholic father and the criminal exploits it led him to and which subsequently got him into prison.  Using the third person narrative, Thompson paints himself as a dangerously volatile man prone to violent outbursts of temper.  It is these outbursts that landed him on The Rock, but it is there that he overcame those troubles and attempted to turn his life around.  Sadly it was not to be, Whitey returned to prison one more time...<br />Rock Hard is an engrossing read that is a tad melodramatic.  At times it reads more like a dimestore pulp novel than a true to life account, but the old cliche 'life is stranger than fiction' should be kept in mind.  Thompson details how life in prison can be a maddening repetition of the same boring routine, one that can drain the sanity from you.  Yet it can also contain moments of humanity and humor.  After reading the book I can feel nothing but respect for Thompson and what he has managed to accomplish in his reformed life.  Highly recommended to True Crime buffs and those interested in studies of prison life.	2004-01-01

Whether the decay is literal (i.e. his mad killer stories) or symbolic (the supernatural stuff), no other writer can summon of the level of dread, isolation, and despair that Campbell can.  Waking Nightmares gathers together stories from Campbell's early years (i.e. Jack In The Box) as well as his more recent work.  Although some of the stories are a tad predictable (especially if you have read a great deal of Campbell's work), each is powerful in its own quiet way.  I can't think of a better way to give yourself the heebie-jeebies than by reading anything by Ramsey Campbell.  Highest recommendation.	2003-12-25

It seemed that the ashes of the fire that claimed the lives of David Koresh and his followers had not even cooled when this book about the Branch Davidians, their Living Prophet Koresh, and the tense siege with law enforcement officers appeared on bookshelves at drug stores and supermarkets everywhere.  Because of this, Clifford Linedecker's narrative clearly favors the law enforcement side of the tragic events and what inside information into the compound life seems to come from former members with understandly negative opinions about their experience at the compound.  Linedecker does relate the fascinating history of the Seventh-Day Adventist splinter group and their long line of Living Prophets, for this the book might prove interesting to True Crime fans, but many of the facts and the characterization of life in the compound has, over time, come into question.	2003-12-19

Bonnie Redding arrives at the Redding Institute hoping to bridge a decades long gap between her and her father.  What she finds is a cold, distant scientist, a mystery, and an irresistable hunk of an enigma.  Heart of the Beast suffers from both an emphasis on the mystery over the romance and the beauty hugging most of the spotlight.  The beast seems to spend a lot of time off stage, which makes the romance seem perfunctory, at first.  Nonetheless, I warmed to it (being a horror buff at heart, the werewolf slant and gothic mood made it all worthwhile), liked the characters (although I would have liked to have gotten to know Nicholas better sooner rather than later) and found the bad guy easy to hate.  So I'm giving it an extra star.	2003-12-17

With very little written about the man out there, this book should be considered essential for any Carpenter fan.  The autuer argument is solidly made and hard to disagree with.  The pluses/minuses criticism of each film is mostly fair, although a tad overboard in the enthusiasm department - but who can blame them.  This is Carpenter they are talking about!

Canyon manages to tell very personal, and sometimes quite painful, stories while maintaining a level headed distance from the subject matter (herself).  Thus the reader gets a pretty detailed look at how working in such an industry can either be empowering or demoralizing, and how easy it is to be taken advantage of or to be treated poorly for doing so.  Love or hate the adult film industry, by the book's end you will probably have an admiration for the financial success and mental balance that Canyon has obviously worked so hard to achieve.

Sadly some of my favorite routines (i.e. \\"Chicken Heart\\" and the one where he and Weird Harold stay far longer at a horror movie than they should have) are absent, something that keeps the book from getting five stars.

Ray Loynd's The Jaws 2 Log is a quick yet mostly detailed look at the making of the first sequel to the super thriller Jaws.  Because Loynd did not work on the movie and only observed, it lacks a certain insider feel to the commentary and reads like a more in depth (or just plain wordy) making-the-movie magazine.  What is most interesting is how everybody involved with Jaws 2 seemed to be doing this movie with the certain knowledge that A) a sequel to Jaws, the most popular movie of all time at that time, was inevitable, B) said sequel could never, ever measure up to the event/impact the first movie was, and C) if `they' (i.e. Zanuck, Brown, Scheider, et al) did not do it, then someone else would and that someone else would also get all the cash that would undoubtedly pour into the studio coffers.  So making the sequel, even with the full knowledge that it would in no way measure up to the first movie, was pretty much a no brainer for all involved, though some are noticeably guilty of trying to make a fairly standard (albeit entertaining) summer cash cow sound more important than, in the end, it really was.  That understood, it is nice to see that they at least attempted to put their best foot forward, even though they all stumbled a bit (especially the first director, John Hancock, who departed the movie after only three weeks of filming), and tried to make the best movie they could with what they had.  In my opinion they succeeded, Jaws 2 is, at least, a lot of fun to watch.  Jaws fanatics like me will most likely consider this little marketing tie-in a must have and, to general move buffs, I recommend it highly.  Tons of behind the scenes and movie photos as well.	2003-11-13

From The Breathing Cosbys to Chocolate Cake For Breakfast to Kill The Boy, it is all here, sprinkled with an earnest message for fathers to always love and, just as importantly, be there for your children.  Rereading the book makes me smile and shake my head just thinking about the trials and tribulations I will face with my son, who, sadly, is just like me when I was a boy.  No doubt there will be lots of fresh gray hairs in my future.  The only saddening thing about the book is the obvious love Coz had for his late son.

Perhaps they needed a new writer to create a new story because Stackpole's return to the X-Wing line is a tired affair, its plot having that stale 'one sequel too many' flavor that overplayed franchises tend to get after awhile.  This entry skips ahead several years to the climax of the Thrawn Trilogy (which I have yet to read - having all the books characters and plots be connected is both a blessing and a curse, it is almost impossible to figure out where to start without worrying about spoilers for other books) and the weakened New Republic sets its eyes on a war criminal warlord named Krennel.  But so has Ysanne Isard, didn't one of the Wraith's say they suspected she was still alive?  The enemy of my enemy is my ally, right?  Maybe.  There is plenty of action, but it lacks the emotional investment that Allston managed to put into the fun, exciting, and, most surpisingly, funny (but the right kind of funny) Wraith Squadron series, and the book did not grip my attention the way the far superior Solo Command did.

Quiet and distant in the public eye, Eastwood has managed to create cultural icons of Godzilla proportions with the characters of The Man With No Name and Dirty Harry Callahan, yet he has also shown himself to be both a brilliant and sensitive director with films such as Bird, White Hunter, Black Heart, The Bridges of Madison County, and the Oscar winner Unforgiven.  But Douglas Thompson does not shed any light whatsoever on the artist or business man (although he does let us know what Mayor Clint did for his beloved city of Carmel by the Sea), instead the author focuses on Eastwood's sketchy history of womanizing and the legal troubles stemming from his acrimonious break-up with longtime companion/lover, Sondra Locke.  Only a slim, trim 199 pages in length, Clint Eastwood: Riding High is a quick read, but you will not come away with any greater understanding of this unquestionably unique Hollywood talent and legitimate Living Legend.	2003-10-30

Reading this book after the fact offers little help or solace with my grief and one should really read it before facing the supposed Great Unknown.

Iron First is to Wraith Squadron what The Empire Strikes Back was to Star Wars: A New Hope, a solid and mature sequel that expands the story and its characters into challenging and emotionally satisfying directions.<br />The Wraiths, having pulled off several near brilliant (or very lucky) string of attacks against the Warlord Zsinj, now must come up with a new plan and what a plan it is.  The group poses as pirates in the hopes that they will grab the Warlord's attention and form a partnership.  But that is not all, there is a little payback for a crooked New Republic officer that needs to be dealt out as well and the person the group inlists to help is not who she pretends to be.  Undoubtedly fans will want this on their shelves.  Highly recommended.	2003-10-12

With Rogue Squadron's success in knocking Isaard from power and restoring the flow of Bacta to the New Republic behind him Wedge Antilles now focuses on a new threat, the Warlord Zsinj.  He also has a crazy plan for a new squadron.  One made up of the worst of the best, or is it that the best of the worst?  His idea is to make a commando team that can dog fight in an X-Wing (instead of trying to make ace pilots into commandoes), but can he do it?  Not too hard to figure out that he does and soon the Wraith Squadron is in fierce action.  A nice introduction to a new storyline within the X-Wing subseries and the added humor is a welcome ingredient.  Recommended.	2003-09-15

There are some minor changes in character and motivation, especially in regards to Glen Talbot, and, for the most part, it helps the story more than hinders it (though there are a few narrative wrinkles that another rewrite could have ironed out).  Not a bad book at all, fans will certainly enjoy it.	2003-08-25

This allegory is both a hilarious and unsettling examination of the pitfalls that can trip up ANY Christian (irregardless of denomination) during his or her walk of faith.  Again and again the administrative devil Screwtape offers advises to his novice nephew Wormwood on how best to distract, trip-up, or out and out blind a patient (Lewis's term for the human victim of the devil's temptations).  Each letter is a microscopic examination on a worldly weakness, or strength, that can be slowly twisted and, without the patient being truly aware of it, lead him off the path to salvation.  Anybody on the Christian path will no doubt chuckle and relate to these temptations, easily seeing his or her self facing the problematic issues that Screwtape urges Wormwood to exploit.  I find it hard to believe that this book's of examination of faith and belief and how human weakness can either undermine or strengthen both can be surpassed, either in fiction or non.  An essential book.	2003-08-21

Christian Apologist extraordinaire C.S. Lewis studies the possible answer to these questions.  The answers are intellectually stimulating and thought provoking, to say the least, for those interested in the direction (Christian, primarily orthodox) Lewis's argument takes.  What is more fascinating about the text is the rigid emotional distance Lewis has to the subject, his own personal experience with Pain (told in A Grief Observed) still many years away.  Those wanting a more easy to relate to study should read Grief.  Those wanting a strictly intellectual and emotionally distant look at the concepts and Christian answers could do a lot worse than The Problem With Pain.  Highly recommended.	2003-08-16

Authors Jan Stacy and Ryder Syvertsen collect together a gaggle of creatures that have invaded movie theaters and TV programming over the last 30 to 40 years, ranging from the 30s up to 1980 or so.  Listing is alphabetical, going from Actor Monsters down to Zombie Warriors, with each creature getting a statistic page of its own.  The reader is informed of date of birth (i.e. their source movie's release) and death (if the creature died in the movie), method of either creation or transformation, thematic relations (i.e. the Ants from Empire of the Ants are related to THEM! and Phase IV), strengths, weaknesses, feeding habits, and the best ways to handle said creature.  Tone ranges from jocular to serious and the synopsis spoils each movie's plot.  Listing is uneven, the aforementioned Ants lists Empire of the Ants, while the giANTS of THEM! get a stat page of their own, despite both being giant ant movies, and some names are spelled incorrectly.  Some monster characters are named after the movies in which they appear.  Michael Myers (aka The Shape) is named HALLOWEEN and Jack Torrance SHINING.  While the concept of a monster stat book seems fun, the joke runs out of steam fast, making it a good book for flipping through if you happen to be watching the movie in which a listed monster happens to appear.  The only reason monster fans would want this for their collection is the stills, which are quite good and the only reason the book gets a three star rating.  The text itself rates two stars.  So let's call it a 2 and a half star book.	2003-08-10

It has been a few years since a computer virus caused the robots at the adults only vacation park Delos to murder the human guests.  The problem is fixed and the park has reopened, but distrust is high.  Seeking to improve its PR, Delos asks two investigative reporters, Chuck Browning (Peter Fonda) and Tracy Ballard (Blythe Danner), to tour the park and report on its safety.  What the company rep does not know is that Browning has had a source tell him that something sinister is happening at Delos, yet again.<br />This novelization of the sequel to Westworld is uneven.  The story is good, the characters just okay, and the third act needed some work.  But those are problems with the script by Mayo Simon and George Shcenck that John Ryder Hall adapted.  The problem with the writing in the book is that stage direction is simply described instead worked into a three dimensional story frame and the parts that Hall inserts to add novel texture to the story are pretty easy to see.  But fans of both Westworld and its sequel will find something to enjoy in it.  Enjoy.	2003-08-02

It has been three years since Jason Donovan and his brother Rick were attacked by a wolf that was more than a mere wolf.  Three years spent by Jason searching for the creature responsible for cursing them to answer the call of the moon.  Once he finds it, Jason hopes to kill it and release he and his brother from their prison, so that they may be fully human again, not half wolf.<br />Then Jason is attacked by another werewolf and rescued by Tala Soaringbird.  But when a second werewolf shows up to attack Tala, Jason instinctively leaps to her defense.  He awakens to find himself her prisoner in a secret tribal world hidden deep inside the woods of Canada.  There the mystery of who changed him and how he must learn to live with his new identity is revealed.<br />Drive-In Movie critic Joe Bob Briggs has a routine where he complains of \\"Way too much plot getting in the way of the story.\\"  Call of the Moon suffers a tad from that.  Less time is spent on the romance between Jason and Tala and more on Jason learning the ropes of his environment.  Granted there is a reason for this, but one would hope for more romance in a romance novel.  There is some nice humor and the twists are credible, so the book is not a complete wash-out.  Four stars might be a tad over generous, but the book left me hoping the author would revisit her characters.  Tala's brother especially, who is in need of a strong woman.  Recommended strictly to werewolf fans.	2003-07-28

UFO infotainment about an alleged crash at Shag Harbour.  Like far too many books of this kind, it is chock full of witnesses with false names (i.e. \\"We will call him 'Harry'.\\") and second hand rumors that lead nowhere.  Something landed, but nothing save strange foam was ever found.  That is basically all the authors can offer in 168 pages of second hand rumors and conjecture disguised as fact.  Reading this book, one can see why the Shag Harbour 'incident' never caught on the way that the one in Roswell, New Mexico did.  Nothing compelling happened!  There are two moments of irony in the book though.  Much is made of a conservative paper's bold statement of a UFO crash, only the writers later reveal that this had little to do with factual reporting and more to do with a believer staff member 'jumping the gun'.  The paper was correct in removing the man from the story, he clearly could not be objective about the material and let the readers decide for themselves.  The funniest irony though is when the authors and a television film crew from the show SIGHTINGS are confronted by believers and accused of hiding facts after they go out at night for some atmosphere shots.  They went out at NIGHT, clearly this meant they FOUND something they wanted no one to know about.  Pretty silly, considering that the whole point of the segment is to PROVE a UFO crash, don't you think?  While the authors clearly admit to feeling that the shoe is on the other foot (the simple truth is dismissed by some as an outright lie), neither realize that they just might be doing the exact same thing, dismissing simple fact as 'plausible denial'.  The book is more interesting for those glimpses of reality bending to fit a world view more so than for any of the supposed 'hard evidence' the authors claim to offer.  For paranormal completests only.	2003-07-21

The Last Vampire begins twenty or so years after the ending of Strieber's cult novel The Hunger (to which TLV is a continuation of) with Miriam Blaylock seeking a mate so she may not lose her last chance to have a child.  Instead of finding a mate, she finds a nightmare.  Humans, which are considered by all vampires but her to be nothing but mindless cattle upon which to feed, have become aware of their blood drinking Keepers and are now waging a fierce war to kill them off.  It seems that, in Asia at least, the humans have been successful.  Miriam flees, stopping only long enough to feed, but makes a terrible mistake.  A terrible mistake that allows CIA Agent and Vampire Hunter Paul Ward to pick up her trail and the chase is on.  Quite a merry chase it turns out to be, from Bangkok to Paris to New York.  Strieber reinvents his horror novel to an epic supporting universe and manages to bring back Sarah Roberts, the guilt ridden victim of Miriam's seduction in The Hunger, as well.  Most of the novel is an enlongated chase sequence, Strieber showing a welcome dexterity in both characterization and world building while his characters either flee or pursue.  There is no shortage of bloodletting and even some nice tongue-in-cheek references to some of Strieber's other works, not to mention a nice twist on the sometimes insane level of Political Correctness in the world.  The only downside that readers should be forewarned about is that The Last Vampire does appear to be a chapter in a much larger body of work and it will leave most with a hunger for more.

Luke Skywalker, Han and Leia Solo, and Lando Calrissian shoot off in all directions, chasing down leads and facing slithering threats on all fronts.  Rusch's entry into the Star Wars saga moves quicky, jumping from action to intrigue and back to action, always leaving a question as to what will happen next hanging in the air - cliffhanger serial storytelling at its finest.  The author also adds a dash of tongue-in-cheek humor to the plotting.  The main baddie is a Sith Lord with a penchant for wearing a skull mask who sports the first name DOLPH.  Having recently watched the Masters of the Universe movie prior to reading this, I got the semi-subtle joke.  Nice to know that someone can have fun with this style of entertainment and not have it spoil the overall seriousness of the story.  So close is the narrative to the tone of the movie series that you can easily visualize the visual swipes between cliffhangers, all set to the rousing music of John Williams, of course.

The edge of your seat grabber Hot Definiton being a particular outstanding choice read in that department.  Those wanting more sex focused stories and not hungering for real stories with just a basis in sex or sexuality had better look elsewhere.

Whitley Strieber's fourth book examing the long reaching personal impact/influence that the 'Visitors' have had on him moves the author even farther away from the mainstream audience he jolted with his disturbing tale, Communion.  The Secret School begins with his recalling mysterious lessons learned in childhood at a hidden location in the Olmos Basin of San Antonio, Texas.  As the events progress, Strieber again paints himself as someone gifted with seeming paranormal abilities (i.e. time travel) and discernment (the book ends with numerous predictions, most of which have yet to come to pass in the six or so years - the time at which I am writing this - since The Secret School was first published).  Once again I got the feeling that Strieber is less interested in understanding the Communion experience and more focused on becoming a mover and shaker in the New Age movement (his recent offering of two more 'teaching' books, The Path and The Key, appear to confirm this).  Too bad, for the first portion of the book (featuring a child's dream trip to Mars and an attempt to join an amateur astronomy class) hint at a compelling story that would have touched a far broader audience if hidden behind the veil of fiction.  As it reads now, the book is nothing but mildly interesting infotainment (i.e. information so sketchy and unverifiable that it is better to read it as simple entertainment).  Strieber, as is usual for this sub-genre, keeps the paranormal research overly fuzzy.  For example, in the Third Lesson, he mentions travelling through time.  But when he digs for some corroborating evidence he only finds a '1945 story' about a woman who briefly appeared and then disappeared on forty-second street (page 55 of my mass market paperback edition), yet he neglects to reveal the exact calender date, nor the name of the periodical and the location of the article in it.  He then follows this with more vague stories of &quot;tracking down rumors&quot; and &quot;polling his group of friends&quot; with no dates or information suitable for fact checking.  It takes a lot more than second hand stories to convince the skeptics.  Strieber also makes claims of being granted visions of a past life that was instrumental in getting the Roman Emperor Octavius to power (and thus saving the Empire from a far too early destruction).  My is it not interesting that past lives are all filled with important derring do and intrigue?  Not many past life regressions I have heard about ever detail, say, standing in a line at the bank waiting to make a deposit or some other simple errand.  Mr. Strieber's pre-Communion books War Day and Nature's End both clearly showed that he wanted to push his fiction past moderately successful horror stories and into the realm of more awareness raising and/or influencing writing.

Communion told the story of a man confronted with the unkown and struggling to make sense of it.  Transformation continued the interior dialogue begun in Communion and, while it helped Mr. Strieber clear up some of his own jumbled memories, it offered his readers no new insights or evidence.  Breakthrough: The Next Step however attempts to do just that, but Mr. Strieber's days of being taken seriously ended with this highly subjective attempt to understand just what the Visitors are trying to accomplish with himself and other abductees.  Strieber makes a sloppy (and some what disturbing) argument that he is some kind of Chosen One, being granted visions to help enlighten others.  The author clearly is attempting to move past being a simple abductee and reinvent himself as a kind of New Age guru.  Not helping are the giant spiders in his bedroom and the little bald guys playing piggy-back with him in his New York office. Sadly, despite all the promises of hard evidence he makes, he just trots out the same old tired conspiracy theories and foggy rumors that everyone else does, and offers no concrete sources to fact check quoted statements or theories.  In the end, the book is more interesting for its insight into Mr. Strieber's character than for its examination of the abduction phenomena.  Best left to the obsessively curious.	2003-06-12

However, to be honest, the short tale is not Straub's strong point.  He works best in long, intricate narratives that both use and deconstruct the thriller genre, all the while saturating the story with literary and cultural references, parodies, and homages.  Each of the stories collected contain some of these elements, but not all of them.<br />Ashputtle will have you rethinking that pudgy grade school teacher you mocked, or the one you now entrust with the education of your child.

Porkpie Hat is a classic tale, the story within the story not only a beautiful return to the ghost story form for the author, but it is also Straub at his deconstructionist finest.  Revelling in how our storytelling allows us to communicate a hidden truth and overcome tragedy.  Hunger, An Introduction offers yet another story within a story, trying to make us understand what makes ghosts haunt us so.  It also expands on themes presented in The Ghost Village quite nicely.  The closing story, Mr. Clubb and Mr. Cuff, is a hilarious, albeit gruesome, black comedy about the karmic nature of revenge.  Those who long for a return to witty, intelligent and literate genre writing need look here.  Highly recommended.	2003-06-08

Starting with the first Malpaso film (the Ted Post directed Hang 'Em High) and ending with Eastwood's White Hunter, Black Heart (just when the actor/producer/director was getting long overdue critical attention) Plaza focuses less on Eastwood and more on the dedicated crew he has built over the years.  Composers, cinematographers, costume designers, and even sound editors all have a say in how they help Eastwood craft his distinctive productions.  If there is a drawback to this coffee table book edition, then it is Plaza's over praise of Eastwood's movies (with the one exception of the second Dirty Harry movie, Magnum Force - interestingly it is illustrated with a still from the THIRD Dirty Harry movie, The Enforcer).  Every one is called masterful and brilliant and unique, which is untrue.  While Eastwood has produced numerous classic movies, none are without flaws.

Picking up at the exact moment The Mandalorian Armor concluded, Slave Ship has Boba Fett (now fully recovered from his partial digestion in the Sarlacc's gut) skipping over the dangling knots of the conspiracy he helped set in motion many years before.  Just as was the case in the trilogy's opening chapter, Slave Ship jumps between past (shortly after the destruction of the Death Star that concluded A New Hope) and present (roughly parallel with Return of the Jedi) as author K.W. Jeter takes us on an intimate tour of the gutter of the galaxy.  While it certainly is a smartly written tale, the series lacks a sympathetic character to root for.  The reader simply watches nasty people do nasty things to each other for several hundred pages, and Boba Fett is far too robotic in his characterization to seem to warrant a three book arc.  Nonetheless, fans will gobble it up and ask for more.	2003-05-14

Claire Hansen is a Keeper, someone gifted with magical powers and burdened with fixing metaphysical accidents.  When she and her talking cat Austin answer a summons they are suprised to find themselves in charge of a Bed and Breakfast with a hole to Hell in the furnace room.  Claire resents the job from the start, feeling that she is far too young to become an eccentric recluse.  Complicating matters is the hunky stud who works there, an amorous ghost who lusts to be made flesh, and assorted odd guests (vampires, werewolves, and retired Greek Gods).  Then there is the irritating neighbor and her pet doberman, Baby.<br />Make no mistake, Summon the Keeper is laugh out loud funny more times than not and the characters are vibrant and likable.  But the novel is missing a very important element, a strong story to link all these events together.  As it is now, the book reads like several scripts to an inventive sitcom taped together.  It's just fluffy escapism that's as solid as cotton candy.	2003-05-01

Of the three Resident Evil books I have read so far, City of the Dead is the best.  For those unfamiliar with the game plot, it's a multi-character piece.  The main focus more or less divided between Claire Redfield, searching for her brother Chris, he of the recently fallen S.T.A.R.S. Unit, and Leon Kennedy, a new member of the Raccoon Police Department who shows up to his first day on the job to a city overrun with flesh-eating zombies, skinless dogs, and snake tongued monsters.  There are several supporting characters that add a mixture of mystery and motivation to the heart pounding action, which S.D. Perry shades with just enough background detail to let the novelization read well as a story.  Having not played the game, I cannot rate this entry in the series on anything more than how much fun it was to read (this isn't literature after all, just escapism) and on that level it leaves me eager to dig into the next one.  So, yeah, I recommend it, but only for fans of the Resident Evil universe.	2003-04-21

Why add on a completely needless epilogue to a perfectly good two book arc?  I knew this installment was in trouble when, strictly for the sake of starting a new storyline, the sole survivor of the genocidal aliens of the first two books does something utterly out of character.  She (do weeds even have a gender?) gives a portable Genesis device to a Bajoran priest.  Why?  Don't ask me.  But the stench of Flop Sweat rolls off the pages in waves.  Things briefly look up in the second chapter when the crew of the Enterprise investigate a derelict ship, only to confront Lovecraftian horrors lurking within it.  Then it all falls apart again, with Vornholt stumbling between the uninteresting chase for the Genesis Suitcase and the Enterprise crew facing the space/time rift and the horrors it births.  Neither storyline compliments the other, in fact it feels too much like two different novels cut and pasted together.  Even more depressing is how foolishly the crew behaves this time out.  You would think the Moss Creatures of Books One and Two would not need mind controlling spores with a group this dense.  The idea that whole planets are defended by these dolts is more terrifying than the monsters crawling out of the rift.  I cannot even recommend this tired entry to the die hard Trek fans.	2003-04-14

The Genesis Wave, a mutated form of Dr. Carol Marcus's long believed buried Genesis Project, has washed over the planet Myrmidon, transforming it into a primordial horror.  The Romulan phase shifting technology may have worked, sparing the lives of tens of thousands inhabitants, but the survivors are now intruders on a world not meant for them, and they are not alone.  The creature behind the Neptune's pre-Wave assault on the Myrmidon shields infiltrates and attempts to hijack the Enterprise.  Meanwhile Dr. Leah Brahms and her crew of Klingons try to track down the home of the genocidal aliens to avenge those that have died.<br />The first book of the series had everybody discovering the Wave and then running from it for their very lives while trying to figure out a way to stop it, or at least survive it, at the same time.  Book Two allows the now haggard Federation forces, and our cast of characters in particular, the chance to fight back and get a few choice jabs at their new enemy.  While light on dramatic story, B2 does not skip on the action that fans crave from the series.  In the long run a four star rating may seem generous, but I'm grading this strictly on the entertainment curve.  Recommended to fans only.	2003-04-09

In the wake of the Genesis Project debacle the Federation attempted to destroy all record of it and placed Dr. Carol Marcus in hiding.  While they were successful, they were not successful enough.  Some 90 years later, Dr. Marcus is kidnapped and, a few months after that, a monstrous energy wave begins to sweep across the galaxy, reforming every planet it comes in contact with.  Just who, or what, is responsible for this genocidal attack?  You'll have to find out in Book Two!<br />Book One of the Genesis Wave trilogy is okay when looked at as the first act of a three part story.  While it does an excellent job of introducing the monstrous threat to our heroes and laying out the hints and clues of the mysterious forces behind it, that is all that it does well.  The novel lacks a strong dramatic story hook.  Georgi La Forde's infatuation and search for a possible Wave survivor and how it effects a possible affair with another female visitor on the Enterprise is not the stuff that makes for compelling drama, actually it feels rather juvenile.  Weak story aside, the epic threat and the mystery of just who, or what, unleashed it is interesting enough to have me started on the next book, but this is strictly for devoted fans of the long running series.	2003-04-07

Caliban Cove is the first original novel based on the survival horror storyline from the popular Resident Evil games.  Author S.D. Perry deserves kudos for delivering the expected goods and keeping them fresh, threatening, and interesting.  The story picks up shortly after the events at the Spencer Mansion have concluded and the surviving S.T.A.R.S. members disgraced by the slimy tentacles of the Umbrella Corporation.  Adding insult to injury is the discovery that their own organization is a part of the monstrous conspiracy.  Raccoon City S.T.A.R.S. team member Rebecca Chambers joins up with a Maine based branch that is intent on digging up evidence of Umbrella's misdeeds at the company's Caliban Cove facility.  What the team does not know is that the unstable scientist in charge of the research there has become completely detached from reality, creating an army of zombies and monsters and a plan to infect the world with a stronger, airborne variant of the T-Virus.<br />The pace of the book is every bit as quick as The Umbrella Conspiracy, but it reads far better.  More like a story than a playing out of a video game's puzzles and obstacles in narrative form.  Perry shows she has both a solid grip on the ideas and concepts that drive the games as well as a talent for expanding those into an entirely new story without loosing touch with what makes the universe of the Resident Evil games so addictive for its numerous fans.  Highly recommended.	2003-04-01

The discovery of the alien Grazer in Central Park seems, at first, to be just an average nuisance.  That is until MiB agents Jay and Elle discover a horrifying truth.  Someone dressed in black has invited the most loathsome lifeforms in the galaxy to come and eat.  This causes troubles on two fronts.  The first being that the Grazers are addicted to earth plants, and once they start eating they cannot stop until they run out of food.  The second it that each and every lifeform in the galaxy takes the invitation as a personal slight, so vast armadas begin flocking to Earth to give its inhabitants a taste of their rage.  Earth is doomed, unless MiB agents Jay and Elle can root out just who is responsible for this horrible act.<br />There are pluses and minuses to this MiB spin-off novel, which seems to be, sadly, the last.  On the plus side is that author Dean Wesley Smith, after an uneven, albeit an entertaining one, start in The Green Saliva Blues, seems far more comfortable with the characters and the silly world that they inhabit.  The story moves quickly and maintains its tension and does not wear out its welcome.  The downside, and the biggest hint as to why these books did not catch on, is that The Grazer Conspiracy is a retread of the fist story.  Yet again a reviled alien species camps out on Earth for a feeding frenzy and massive armies of angry aliens threaten the world.  The only real difference is that, instead of maneating trees, we get plant eating aliens.  Clearly the options for stories were beginning to run dry.  Despite that, The Grazer Conspiracy is a fun ride well worth taking for MiB fans.  Recommended.	2003-03-28

The eighth book in the seemingly endless End Times series Left Behind stayed true to form for me.  While the odd numbered titles maintain my interest and keep me entertained, the even numbered ones just do not work for me well at all.  As was the case with The Indwelling, The Mark picks up at the precise moment the previous book concluded and, for the first hundred or so pages, everything seems fine.  Author Jerry B. Jenkins sets up a rolling procession of cliffhangers for his characters to work through and, as long as he keeps them moving towards some sort of goal, the book works just fine.  But once the rescues are finished, the new and improved safe house is set up, and new believers surface to replace those that have died, the book stalls, and badly.  Why?  Because Jenkins focuses on emotional and religious issues and, since his characters cannot be read as anything other than props in a narrative, it is a chore to get through, because none of the weeping and testimonial sharing really rings true.  Also frustrating is knowing that Jenkins is setting up for events that will take place in the next series entry, not in this book.<br />Also obvious is that the backlash against the Left Behind series really got rolling with this entry, with a Christian character taking the mark of the beast.  That Jenkins would twist prophetic beliefs just to keep his simplistic story moving in an easy to control direction just goes to show that, from a writer's perspective, Jenkins is deathly afraid of rolling up his sleeves and getting his hands dirty with the real work of telling a credible End Times fantasy yarn.  Can't recommend this one, sorry.	2003-03-20

The seventh book in the seemingly endless End Times series Left Behind continues the tradition of my liking the odd numbered titles slightly more (or a lot more) than the even numbered ones.  This entry in the serial picks up right at the assassination of Nicolae Carpathia, with the Tribulation Force running for cover in the resulting panic.  Author Jerry B. Jenkins comes up with a unique timeline to keep the pace tight this time around, having the novel only cover the 72 or so hours between Carpathia's death and when he arises from the dead, fully indwelt with the spirit of Satan itself.  The novel works best when we get to spy on the autopsy of the slain Potentate or watch a funny (well I laughed) run in between David Hassid and a self-important artiste named Guy Blod.  Where it stumbles badly is when it has characters make great, global leaps in a incredibly short period of time.  The earth is not THAT small.  Jenkins writing remains strictly on the comic book level with the characters painted only in the broadest and most simplistic of strokes.  While Rayford Steele threatened to develop a third dimension (character wise) in the previous novel (Assassins), the chance shrivels up and dies here, which is not surprising.  This series remains the narrative equal to those old Irwin Allen disaster flicks of the seventies.  Those who enjoy this kind of literary junk food will no doubt eat it up, but those that do not will only shake their head and wonder just what it is that keeps its readers so enthralled.	2003-03-12

Mere Christianity is, more less, the Mount Everest of 20th century Christian apologetics, and its exclaimed stature is completely justified.  I find it hard to believe that any who read it would come away with a poor view of Christians and their beliefs.  Lewis cuts past all the minor differences that divide the various denominations and explains what the utmost core beliefs and stances are and, yes, it is very hard to argue his logic in regards to a Higher Authority or an Absolute Truth.  Whether or not the book serves well as a conversion tool, well I will leave to an individual reader's personal reaction to it.  But taken as an explanation of and argument for my religious beliefs, then I give Mere Christianity my highest of high recommendations.	2003-03-06

This look at the addictive, wild and wonderfully whacky (and, at times, tacky) imported delight that is the Japanese fantasy movie.  Most mainstream audiences only know of Godzilla, the true King of the Monsters, and, maybe, Gamera, the flying turtle and Guardian of the Universe.  But there was much, much more than that to Japanese fantasy and Stuart Galbraith's predominantly oral history of the genre covers it all.  The masters and witnesses speak for themselves, sharing memories and personal insights.  The only sour note is one interviewee who takes delight in badmouthing and/or insulting every cult icon he had the priviledge to work with.  Also Galbraith's review section treats just about everything made after the 'Golden Age' (50s to mid to late 60s) as dreck and I disagree with him almost completely.  But neither of those commentaries ruins the book or casts a shadow over the contribution to Pop Culture these individuals made.  A must have for fans, highly recommended.	2003-02-28

This seems to be the question that powers the engine of this classic novella from C.S. Lewis.  Of course the answer is, why should it?  Creation is not ours to control, something Lewis seems to hint at with the impenetrable nature of the garden the bus passengers visit at the tale's opening.  Inspired by a science fiction story, Lewis crafted a fantasy of his own that explores the rather petty nature of humanity that keeps our eyes (or souls) closed from the beauty of creation.  The book features some splendid yet amusing passages (Unicorns in Heaven?  Cool!) but it does not skip over the meatier issues of faith, free will, and the traps that they are capable of creating in our oft times bitter hearts.  One thing I found ironic is that the one star reviews put forth some of the very same arguments made by some of the rebellious ghosts in this allegory.  I think that is the very point Lewis hoped his fantasy would make.  Highly recommended.	2003-02-25

It really says something about the quality of this book when most of the reviews can only grumble about that lack of color pictures, or the lack of in depth study given to Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn and Army of Darkness.  While the lack of color pictures did not bother me at all, the rather abbreviated look at the making of the two sequels (as well as Raimi's other movies) left me wanting, especially in comparison to the wonderful amount of information in the first half on how this tightly knit team of friends became one of the most beloved cult movie producers of the 1980s and 1990s.  Quite literally the books reads like a fly on the wall look at the filmmakers baptism by fire, then it shifts gears to...\\"and they went on to make this, this, and this and lived happily ever after.\\"  A little more depth and time about the professional differences in making Dead II and Army of Darkness from the first movie would have been rewarding.  Not helping are the concluding chapters which offer nothing but detailed descriptions of the on screen action in the ED trilogy with parenthetical comments by Bruce Campbell.  Author Bill Warren refers to it as a DVD commentary on paper.  To this reader it just felt like padding.  Nonetheless, more than a few fans will find reflections of themselves in this group of movie makers to be and I don't think any admirer of Raimi and Company will want to do without it.

I'll admit that some of Lewis's comments left me in the dust, but I did appreciate how well grounded some of his arguments were.  If there is not some common shared moral or ethical viewpoint in the mass of humanity, then all will be lost and undoing the teaching of the past is undoubtedly a BIG mistake.  If we do dismantle the teaching of the past and build something knew, just what foundation will it be built upon if the moral or ethical foundation is as small and individualized as grains of sand?  Certainly some will jump all over this essay published as book (actually it reads more like lecture notes than an actual book or essay), but I found little fault with it other than the parenthetical one mentioned above.

As well written and compelling tale as it is, Stephen King's fourth novel in the proposed seven book Dark Tower series will probably disappoint as many readers as it satisfies.  After resolving the cliffhanger ending of The Wastelands and treating us to an alternate dimension of The Stand, King shifts gears.  Most of Wizard and Glass is Roland telling a campfire tale of how he met his One True Love, Susan Delgado, and how she became one of the many ghosts that haunt and drive him him in his quest to right the slowly toppling Tower.  While the yarn is a fine and beautifully textured one that creates a magical land that marries the gritty Spaghetti Western Mythos, made famous by Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood, with the noble myth of King Arthur, Merlin, and his Knights of the Round Table with an awe inspiring narrative surety, the story feels needless.  Long time readers of the series may squirm even as King delights with this tragic tale set in a Barony a long time ago and far, far away.  Some readers, like this one, may wonder why King is wasting so much time telling a story he has already spoon fed to us through hings and flashbacks in previous novels.  Mayhap the tale needs to be told so Roland's new prentices will have a needed wedge between them, or have knowledge of their leader that strengthens their some times fragile ka-tet, for a future battle.  I do not know, I am not Stephen King and have no clue what direction the final books will take.  All I can say is that, right now, as fine a piece of fantasy writing that it is, Wizard and Glass seems a poor choice for a mid-series coffee break.  The story feels far better suited for a Dark Tower prequel series than for the main series itself, so I'm docking it a star, while still recommending it to both fans of epic fantasy as well as to King's beloved Constant Readers.	2003-02-10

Forty years, a failed marriage, affair, and suicide attempt later, Dale Stewart returns to his hometown and rents out the farm where of his childhood friend Duane had lived.  He hopes to write a novel about the mysterious events of the almost forgotten summer of 1960, when Duane died.  But strange and disturbing phenomenon, black dogs, neo-nazis, and old friends and enemies continually distract him.  Unlike some reviewers, I love what Simmons has done in A Winter Haunting - which is write a classic, literate ghost story that both plays by the rules while intellectually reinventing them without breaking or denying them.  Simmons has both Dale Stewart and the reader wondering about Dale's sanity.  What exactly does Dale's failed affair with Clare Two Hearts have to do with the events at the farmhouse?  Is Dale leaving himself notes?  Is any of this really happening at all?  And just who is haunting who?  Questions a pedestrian and special effects laden spook story would not have the reader asking as the events unfold.  A Winter Haunting is a classic chiller that expands on the psychological complexity of Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House with stunning power.  Highly recommended.	2003-01-21

The story behind Stephen King's short 'novel' Cycle of the Werewolf is actually far more interesting than the book itself.  Once upon a midnight dreary, when King hammered away at the typewriter 24/7, he was asked to draft a story for a calender - twelve 500 word chapters to keep fans comfy throughout the year.  King eventually came up with a werewolf story, with a full moon occuring each month to keep the tale well spiced, and got to work.  While the first few chapters were no problem, just attacks setting up the werewolf threat, but once King had to introduce a character to do battle with the lycanthorpe, he found himself in trouble.  The chapters ran too long.  When he asked if a little book was okay, the publisher who pitched the idea to King was all smiles - for a BOOK by Stephen King might sell better than a CALENDER.  The end result was a sketchy little dance King did more out of a desire to see if he could rather than telling a story we badly wanted to tell.  Bernie Wrightson delivers some slam bang illustrations (far better than the work he did for the Creepshow comic book tie-in, albeit that is more fun to revisit than Cycle is) that get the book's rather unique origins down.  Nonetheless Cycle of the Werewolf remains a curiosity piece for King fans more than a satisfying read and is worth getting for the drawings more so than the text.  It's a little surprising that, with so little to work with, King crafted one of his better screenplays, Silver Bullet, from this source story, fleshing it out nicely as a feature film.	2003-01-16

For readers who have ever wondered what a book co-written by Dean Koontz and David Morrell would be like, the answer can be found in the pages of James Byron Huggins's The Reckoning. What we have here is a conspiracy by a select group of very powerful bad guys trying to track down a special bit of prophecy kept out of the bible, namely one that has the exact time, date, and, most importantly, the NAME of the dreaded Anti-Christ contained therein. They also plan to kill all that come in contact with it so their evil plan cannot be hindered (didn't they also do that in The Spy Who Loved Me movie?). Standing in their way is Gage, a best-of-the-best-one-man-army type that is the usual focus of these potboilers. Gage is a stone faced type of hero that is SO unstoppable and is so perceived to be untouchable that I couldn't help but think that this was a Steven Seagal movie waiting to be made, as the best of the best unstoppable untouchable one man army character is his trademarked persona. Every other character is out of a comic book as well, but people don't read these testosterone oozing tomes for insightful character studies or deep thoughts. They want righteous heroes beating the tar out of unrighteous bad guys, and on that level, The Reckoning delivers the goods in generous amounts. Fans of this kind of fiction will no doubt enjoy it, but personally I enjoyed Huggins's man versus fire breathing dragon yarn Leviathan a little bit more than this.	2003-01-10

Neo-gothic thriller writer John Saul takes the creepy hotel out of his novel 'The Right Hand of Evil' and sets it down next to Central Park West and then moves the youth sucking old people from his novel 'Darkness' into it and cooks up with one of his most lukewarm offerings in years, Midnight Voices.  The novel starts off farily well, with a murder and a nightmare sequence that may or may not be an actual nightmare.  Then its all downhill from there.  By the fifty page mark it is clear to the genre savvy reader just what is going on in The Rockwell (that not too subtle ironic name, think Norman, is about as witty as Saul gets) and the reader must work through another two hundred or so pages before the characters figure out the plainly obvious, that evil inhabits The Rockwell.  Not helping is that it is evil we have seen done before, to death, in better told tales.  Longtime fans of Saul will no doubt read this out of obligation, but others will put it down long before the heroes figure out the danger they are in.	2002-12-30

In Touch minister/Bible teacher Dr. Charles F. Stanley uses the Old Testament Book of Proverbs as a teaching tool to show the necessity of studying and living by God's Truth. He begins with comparing the benefits of Godly Wisdom with the shortcomings of Worldly Knowledge/living, exploring the most common problems Christians can/will face in a self focused world and the need to stay strongly focused on the teachings in God's Word, the Bible. After going over the benefits and essentials of learning Godly Wisdom, Dr. Stanley then devotes entire chapters to closely examining the problems of temptation, the importance Godly friendships (think having a non-believer as a close friend is good for both you and the non-believer, think again!) and work environments (where your faith can be hammered mercilessly by non-believers), and the need of wisdom strengthened faith in times of conflict and crisis. All in all, Walking Wisely is an excellent study guide to help strengthen your reading of God's Word. I give it a high recommendation.	2002-12-11

Assassins picks up shortly after the last few afflicted by the Demon Locusts in Apollyon have recovered. Rayford Steele is getting a very itchy trigger finger, a Trib. Force member dies, and 200 or so million horsemen gallop around the globe, choking and burning unbelievers to death.<br />Not a happy time for all involved, and it shows. Assassins is a more somber and mature chapter than Apollyon as the Believers continue to wage war against the AntiChrist's growing power, but what is the point? The outcome is predetermined and, rather than continually lying, cheating, and stealing, shouldn't these believers be trying to convert and save the lost? Although the story is still told in Jenkins's trademarked breezy and action emphasizing style, the author does have his characters confront some serious ethical issues (especially Rayford, who is coming apart at the seams in this outing) and, while this does rob the book of some level of escapist fun, it makes for a more thoughtful read than one would expect from a Left Behind book.

Once again Max Lucado uses seemingly bland every day events - forgetting the alarm code, misplacing a contact lens, or just reaching out to family during long and strenuous trips - to communicate how God works in seemingly hopeless or hope draining situations.  He divides the book into three different subjects of conversation (and reading Max Lucado feels very much like you are having a conversation with him) - Stress of Demands, Storms of Doubt, and Sting of Failure - offering up plenty of Scriptural backed up anecdotes on how to better understand God in action, even when he seems the most distant.  Some examples touched on matters that are very important to me, others just seemed quaint and diverting, but little more.  Fans of the preacher who writes or the writer that preaches will need no encouraging to give this book a look, others unfamiliar with him should give it a look as well.  Recommended.	2002-11-21

Billy Graham's book Approaching Hoofbeats, although being nearly twenty years old (at the time of this review), is as timely as the day it was first put to paper.  The world famous Evangelist studies some of the famous symbols of John's Revelations and how they are more important than ever in today's world and Church.  I admit that I approached the book with a bit of unease, the Bible warns against listening to those that interpret omens, and some believe that extends to those who try to second guess the Bible and the timing of prophecy events that Jesus said only God would know, within the context of the fiction arena, as with the Left Behind series or The Omen trilogy, I have no problems - it's fantasy.  However my worries soon vanished as Mr. Graham, instead of belting out the cliched 'the end is now', leaves the inevitable to God and instead focuses on how Christians must remain diligent in faith and practice (i.e. really walk the Walk instead of puffing out our collective chests and talking the Walk).  The three chapters devoted to the White Horse of Deception, I think, should be required reading for any Christian, both new to the faith or smugly tooling around with those \\"I'm gonna be raptured\\" bumper stickers (remember, Pride cometh before the fall!) next to the license plate.  His firm stance on promoting peace, giving selflessly to those in need, and remaining true to scripture makes for an invigorating read.  Highly recommended.	2002-11-15

Jimmy McDonough does a superlative job of bringing the fascinating life of the late and almost completely unmissed misanthropic sexploitation/schlock horror movie maker Andy Milligan to light. Reader be warned, this is an unflinching look at life in the nightmarish rough trade underworld of New York. Milligan started in amateur theater before helping to create the boiling milieu that birthed the Off-Broadway Theater movement in the early sixties. Then he moved to the 42nd street grindhouses, making exploitation 'classics' that are eye scalding in their badness and impossible to forget, no matter how hard you try. Yet McDonough continually points out that, as bad as Milligan's movies were, they could only be made by Andy, being infused with the writer/director's utter contempt for women, family, and just about everything else humanity offered. Being a recalcitrant and secretive subject for McDonough, Milligan (as the author warns) sometimes fades from the narrative, but never from the world he inhabits. By the time Milligan leaves theater for the exploitation movie business we can fully understand why McDonough found Milligan such a hypnotically fascinating figure. For fans of exploitation movies, The Ghastly One is an essential book. Highest recommendation.	2002-11-08

To use an over used cliche, Colleen Faulkner has saved the best for last.  When Ben Gordon tracks down the owner of Sayer and Sons, the new painting company in Land's End, to complain about what a terrible job has been done, he is surprised to find that Sayer is a beautiful woman.  Another thing 'Confirmed' Bachelor #3 does not know is that Mackenzie Sayer knew him in High School and that she still harbors the sting of a broken heart.<br />Taming Ben is filled with heat, heart, and surprises galore, none of which I want to reveal here, I mean why spoil the fun of discovery for you?  If I had any complaints, they would be 1) not enough Owen or Zack, I missed their playful ribbing and 2) this marks the end of the series.  Perhaps Ms. Faulkner could do a sequel series with the Bachelors Inc kids finding their life long loves?  Highly recommended, the series is a keeper.	2002-11-06

Widow Jordan Cady is just punching the clock as a pilot for United Airlines, saving up money to invest in a Colorado horse ranch for her and her daughter, when a freak storm turns out to be an alien ship that captures her flight.  The Captain has a heart attack and that leaves Jordan in charge.  Kao is the alien tasked with informing the survivors that Earth has been destroyed by a comet and the passengers and crew of United Airlines Flight 58 are the only survivors.  Kao, being a former POW in the recent intergalactic war, sympathizes with the refuges, especially the beautiful co-pilot leader.  But something behind the scenes of this rescue smells...<br />Contact is nice piece of escapist fantasy, although parallels between the books fictional world and the real life events of 9/11 sometimes bring an unwanted dose of harsh reality to the tale.  Nonetheless, for lovers of romance and/or space fantasy, Contact delivers.  Recommended.	2002-11-04

Ned Wilcox's father, Pennsylvania State Police Trooper Curt Wilcox, is dead, killed in a horrific accident by a drunk driver (the uncomfortable parallels to the author's own accident are nothing more than a spooky coincedence, or so King informs the Constant Reader in the Author's Note).  Sandy Dearborn is not surprised when Ned begins to do odd jobs around his late father's Troop Barrack, but he is dismayed when Ned eventually uncovers Troop D's scary little secret, the Buick Roadmaster hidden in Shed B.  The Troop now must tell Ned an unpleasent tale of the unkown.<br />From A Buick 8 is, if the recent interviews and press announcements are to be believed, Stephen King's final original novel (only the remaining three Dark Tower novels are yet to be published).  If that is truly the case and King has finally kicked his publishing addiction, then the one time King of Horror has gone out with a mature, albeit frustrating, work.  What makes Buick 8 frustrating is that it deals with the Great Mystery of Life, the Roadmaster that is less a Buick than a portal to some horrid alien dimension (perhaps the same one that Project Arrowhead burst into in King's classic novella The Mist) is clearly meant to symbolize death, or loss, or both.  The predominant message of the book seems to be that we must learn to live with it as opposed to conquering it, or so a first reading of the book seems to want to say.  King's writing, as always, is accessible and his characters are real, the novel more than once offering up a poignant and painful naturalist photo of life in today's world.  Some may complain that King did not go out with a more traditional novel, but don't be discouraged.  The King went out with a mature and literate work that invites revisiting.

Contact between the species is still proceeding at a far too reluctant pace for some.  Sadly, that pace is further hindered by the arrival of the Pitar, a species of alien that embodies all that humankind aspire to on a physical level (i.e. a planet inhabited by Playgirl and Playboy centerfolds).  However the Thranx are rather suspicious of these newly arrived and friendly, yet very secretive, aliens and fear that the humans may pay a price for their blind confidence.  And pay the humans do, when 600,000 settlers are wiped out in a brutal surprise attack that has left no trace of the aggressors.<br />ADF's second chapter in the Founding Trilogy is a tight, brisk read.  The fallout from the events of the first book is still being dealt with and the Big Picture lessons that humanity needs to learn about its own arrogance and addiction to visually pleasing lifeforms is well delivered, albeit with a heavy hand (600,000!?!).  Some reviews mention the rather abbreviated ending, but this book is the second act in a three act play and, while this particular chapter's story could be expanded into a series of its own (yeah, I thought it was THAT good), in this telling it serves only as an important step in the trail that leads to the Founding.

His ferocious drive to contact and glean inspiration from the recently discovered humans leads Desvendapur to commit several transgressions, including an accidental murder. What Desvendapur does not know is that his almost ruthless drive to acheive something more than what he is is mirrored by the Human Cheelo Montoya, who likewise commits a crime and accidently kills someone to further his own goals.<br />With a sure hand, ADF crafts two very different and yet quite similar characters that are destined to meet and, in an even more unlikely yet completely logical twist, become friends of a sort. That this unlikely and illegal meeting and befriending of two iconoclastic criminals of different species should mark an important step in a larger scheme shows that the Human and Thranx have a lot more in common than they like to think.<br />Several reviews of this book point out its weak story (and sometimes it does read like a travelogue), so potential readers should understand that Phylogenesis is the first part of a trilogy. Plot points and schemes are introduced but not completely resolved for they play integral parts in the remaining two chapters. Taken as a part of a much bigger whole, Phylogenesis is a satisfying opening chapter. Recommended.	2002-10-01

The best thing about Marrying Owen is that it is the first part of a trilogy, so all the wonderful characters Colleen Faulkner introduces (especially Ben's father Max, who is so likable that he deserves a story of his own) can be revisited as their relationships mature and grow (as well as their families).

Whether you agree with Steve Ryfle's criticism of the the later and contemporary Godzilla movies or not (and I do not not, with the exception of the American version, I rate no Godzilla movie lower than three stars), his book remains a fairly exhaustive look at the legendary monster and its decades long film franchise.  Just about any question you may have about the still running series will probably be answered in these pages.  Sadly legal hassles (i.e. it being unauthorized) prevented more photos of the star attraction appearing in the book, but that it is a pretty nitpicking quibble for such a book as this.  If you want cool pictures of The Big &quot;G&quot;, then buy the Cerasini/Leeds Companion.  If you want an affectionate, yet candidly unvarnished, look that people who created and/or appeared in so many wonderfully entertaining movies, then get this.  You will not be disappointed.

One of the greatest voices in 20th century writing as returned to, perhaps for the final time (though I sincerely hope not), that October Country filled to bursting with Dark Carnivals, Magic, and Wonder.  Again and again his words carry us around the world, singing a bittersweet song that is part Dirge and part Ode to Joy for all things shadowy and creepy, sweet and spooky along the way.  As the twilight fades to dawn, all things nightly battle to survive a world that believes it no longer needs them.  But without shadow how can we truly love the light, and vice versa?  Again and again Bradbury shows a unique mastery of the tone poem in this gathering of tales that only he could write.  So gather around the jack o' lantern this Halloween and listen to one of America's literary greats whisper of delightfully spooky things.  Listen.	2002-09-11

Perhaps it was the proximity to the similarly themed Antibodies (the old contaminated man on the run plot again, so soon?), or maybe it was the unnecessary use of profanity (which calls attention to itself in a bad way, is the author that desperate to keep the book out of the YA section?), but this franchise novel (apparently the series last) did not come to life for me.  There was little atmosphere to the proceedings and plot twists and clues seemed contrived (rather than increasing the suspense they seem to happen just to keep the plot moving forward and, contrary to X-Files logic, FBI agents cannot barge in on Police investigations and make them their own just satiate curiosity - they have to be assigned - and they just can't fly all over the globe tracking down clues on a whim - there is paperwork to be filled and expenses to be approved).  For the record, a skin graft goes wrong when the wrong doner is used, causing a formerly meek college professor to go on a killing spree.  This novel maintains interest, but it lacks the feel of the show and is hampered by its shopworn premise.  If this is the best that the hired writers could come up with it is not surprising why the spin-off novels never caught on.	2002-09-03

In the early 1980s Warner Books tried out several numbered Men's Adventure series in the vein of The Executioner and/or The Destroyer.  Although none made it to a second year (i.e. past book 12), the ones that I could not read enough of were the Dirty Harrys.  As far as I was concerned you CANNOT get enough Dirty Harry, ever!<br />Book #9 - The Killing Connection has Inspector Callahan investigating a series of killings in the San Francisco gay community, where there seems to be a serial killer preying on lesbians.  Of course Harry meets a great deal of opposition on both sides of the law and from within the gay community itself, who want a gay police officer assigned to track the killer down.  As with the film series, the action scenes heavily outweigh any real investigative footwork.<br />The Killing Connection was also the last of the Dirty Harry books that I read.  At the time I found most of the action scenes far too similiar between the books and the plotting was quite sloppy (contrivance and/or last minute revelations from left field seemed the series stock handling of its 'mysteries').  Not helping matters in this entry was the sadistic note that mars the ending, making the killers seem almost humanitarian in comparison to Harry.  Despite those weaknesses, I still find myself smiling whenever I think back on reading them.  Sure they were dumb, but they were fun to read as well.  Recommended to fans of the Numbered Adventure series only.	2002-08-29

For those readers that felt Wedge's Gamble was a tad too heavy on the intrigue and lacking in the action, then The Krytos Trap will be the book you were hoping for, and it's the best of the series to date.<br />Corran Horn is being held captive by Ysanne Isard, who badly wants the hot shot to turn and become a weapon against the growing yet still off balance New Republic.  Meanwhile Tycho Celchu is put on trial for Corran's murder.  Kirtan Loor is running a terrorist front to destroy the Bacta that Coruscant so desperately needs and...well why spoil it for you when you can read it yourself.  All the loose plot threads are pulled tight and the twists and surprises kept coming fast and furious, making me turn the pages so fast I was almost tearing them off of the book's spine!  Fans should love this entry, highly recommended.	2002-08-26

Having introduced the core cast of characters in Rogue Squadron, author Michael Stackpole now begins weaving plot lines that will no doubt run through the next few books in the series.  As the first story ended the Rebellion had won a strategic victory that could be the first step to capturing the Imperial Capital planet of Coruscant, or so they have been led to think.  The new Imperial Leader Ysanne Isard actually has an evil scheme to destroy the Rebellion, and our characters seem to be playing right into her slimey hands.<br />Sadly Stackpole cheats a bit in his narrative, characters bump into each other far too easily on what is supposed to be such a crowded and construction jumbled planet, also a team of elite fighters sent on a spying mission?  The Rebellion can't be that hard up for agents and warriors.  On the plus side Stackpole allows the emotional toll of living a resistance fighters life show in his characters, which makes the tension all the more real, as does his frequent use of cliffhanger chapter endings.  In the end the pluses outweight the minuses and Star Wars X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble remains a taut read until the climatic battle.  Recommended.	2002-08-15

Three Famous Short Novels gathers together three long and diverse works by America's greatest writer (that's my opinion, others my contest it, I will only agree to disagree).  Spotted Horses is a humorous tale culled from the pages of The Hamlet, the first novel in the famous Snopes Family Trilogy.  The Bear is the expanded version of the somber and mythic hunting story about the killing a legendary bear that means so much more than just that.  The final story is the exciting adventure yarn Old Man and was one half of the two conjoined novellas that made up The Wild Palms (aka If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem).  Although each story has more power than many writers have in their entire output, they acheive even more when woven into the wide fabric of Faulkner's far reaching, generations spanning Jefferson, Mississippi.

Michael Stackpole's first X-Wing book beats strongly with the pulse of the serial and/or pulp adventures that spawned the source trilogy and is a whale of a good read for it.  Wedge Antilles, the famous X-Wing pilot who flew in both Death Star missions, has to whip a group of recruits into a fierce fighting team or else.  What follows is a lot of action and some nice character introduction.  The book seemed a little cluttered at first, but I reminded myself that there were NINE books in the series, plenty of time to get to know them all quite well.  The story itself is fairly standard stuff (i.e. Top Gun, An Officer and a Gentleman, et al), a group of individuals need to overcome their personal problems (both within themselves as well as with each other) and learn to work as a team, of course there is a fierce battle that will act as the final bonding agent for the team's unity.  Stackpole peppers the yarn with plenty of action and strikes a tone that is the closest to that of the original movies than any of the other spin-off novels I have read to date.  A great start to what I hope is a great series.	2002-08-01

Strange, mind controlling seaweed is getting sucked up from the depths of the ocean and is taking over a natural gas drilling platform and its crew.  Can the Doctor and his companions help save both the day and the threatened crew?<br />Doctor Who: Fury from the Deep is the first Doctor Who adaptation I have read in quite a few years (the last one I clearly remember reading was back in High School) and it wasn't half bad.  Too bad the novel was mostly the shooting script in narrative form, some of the action even reads like stage direction the writer didn't both to translate more effectively.  Some greater attention to atmospheric detail would have been nice.  That quibble aside the book remains a fine adventure that the Doctor's fans should enjoy, but non-fans will no doubt scratch their collective heads and just mutter, huh?	2002-07-30

Alan Dean Foster's first Star Wars novel in almost twenty-five years is a direct lead in for Episode II: Attack of the Clones, so it reads more like the first part of a trilogy rather than a stand alone novel.  The story begins as Obi Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker are sent out to aide another Jedi Knight and her Padawan in negotiations with the planet Ansion,...  Readers expecting a more action packed Star Wars adventure might be disappointed with the amount of world building that Foster does in the narrative and the conclusion leaves the reader hanging (like I said, it's meant to flow right into Episode II), hopefully Foster will write a sequel to this tale and interpolate the narrative events of Attack of the Clones, thus creating a book-movie-book trilogy within the arc of the prequel trilogy.

Considering its subject matter (sexual tempting of priests and hypocrisy in the Church) Whitley Strieber's Unholy Fire seems ripe for republication, and even riper for serious rereading.

A serial predator (obviously based on real life clown/serial killer John Wayne Gacy) breaks into little Billy's room in the dead of night and abducts him.

In interviews Dean Koontz has stated that as a child he fantasized about running away with the carnival/circus and his obsession with it led to one of his best books, The Funhouse isn't it (I was actually referencing Twilight Eyes).  What The Funhouse is is an excellent example of why Koontz makes a poor sell out.  Written before his megabestsellers, The Funhouse is a novelization of the Tobe Hooper horror movie.  Anyone who has seen the movie knows that the screenplay isn't exactly the strongest of material to build a book with, so Koontz added some background details and the result reads like an entirely different story.  Originally published under his Owen West pseudonym, The Funhouse is one best left on the shelf.	2002-07-24

Stephen King's latest and perhaps final (he has been talking up the retirement a bit more than usual these past few months) anthology is a mixed back of screamers and wannabe literary writing (an arena that just is not his strongest area of expression) and is arguably his weakest.  Only two of the tales raise any goosebumps ('The Man in the Black Suit', which deserves every award it has won, and '1408') while several others do capture that elusive blending of literary and pulp that is so distinctly King's style ('Riding the Bullet' and 'Everything's Eventual') many others just fall flat ('Autopsy Room Four' and the utterly useless Dark Tower prequel 'The Little Sisters of Eluria') and the literary stuff ranges from quietly powerful ('Luckey Quarter') to the dead on arrival ('The Death of Jack Hamilton').  There isn't a poorly written tale in the bunch, King's voice is as strong as ever, which only makes the weak stories that much more disappointing.  Still, 'The Man in the Black Suit' and '1408' are well worth the coverprice...of a paperback book.	2002-07-22

When Evan first meets Anna she is wrapped in bandages and recovering from plastic surgery brought upon by a traffic accident linked to the trucking company that has ties to Evan's family.  Once Evan discovers the wonderful person under the bandages, he begins to court Anna.  But the couple's callous and shallow relatives snidely believe Evan is only doing so to protect his family's business and avoid a bankrupting litigation, so the psychological games to break them apart begin.<br />That true beauty comes only from within is one of the messages offered up in The Giving.  But author Modean Moon fumbles by having all of Anna's scarring (including an unsightly birthmark) removed from her face...thus making her &quot;As beautiful outside as she is in.&quot;  And that robs the story of some much needed emotional power.  Sure it truly is what is inside that counts, but do the outside stuff anyway because you will need it anyway is what the book seems to be saying.  There's better variants on the beauty within theme out there, you can skip this one.	2002-07-15

Robert Curran (who co-wrote with victims Jack &amp; Janet Smurl and deomonologists Ed &amp; Lorraine Warren) relates a whale of a tale about how the Smurl family suffered from ever escalating paranormal activity in their home until the place became unlivable.

Sharon Jarvis's collection Dead Zones is more paranormal infotainment (a term for entertainment disguised as information) than anything else. The great thing about books like this is that they show how folk lore and urban legends are born and kept alive. For that alone any book of this genre is worth a look, imagine how boring the world would be without its haunted houses, mysterious creatures, and cursed places.<br />However this book really is more tease than terror. The tales are narrative short shorts and, as usual, skimpy on any real detail (lots of fictionalized names, third party \\"I knew someone who was there\\" descriptions, and anonymous job named persons - i.e. a 'local cop' or a 'woman who is a producer of horror films' -please note, if you cannot easily identify the man described as \\"A noted demonologist who lives in Connecticut\\" then perhaps you should seriously bone up on your paranormal reading!) and some reprints of described photos and/or newspaper headlines would be nice.

Lansdale would be racking up some seriously high sales across the country.  But true justice, as in his most mainstream novel yet, poves to be hard to come by.<br />The Bottoms tells the tale of one boy's harsh coming of age in Depression era East Texas.  A serial killer is at work on colored prostitutes and the boy's struggling father is the constable in charge of the case.  Since the victims are colored, no one but the constable really cares who is doing the killing.  But when it's discovered that one victim wasn't colored, then the temperment changes and fast.<br />The tone of the novel is more melancholic than the gonzo black humor laced tales which made Lansdale famous, but it fits the novel's sad events perfectly.  Valuable things are lost as the nastier side of life is slowly revealed to the narrator.<br />Another thing I would like to point out is the beautiful and understated writing.  Lansdale has become of master of less is more description.  He paints a gritty, yet beautiful picture of the region and the people.  As a twenty plus year Lansdale fan, I give The Bottoms a high recommendation.	2002-07-01

The tightly linked Montana Confidential series (each begins right where the previous entry left off) draws to a semi-impressive close with the outfit's fish out of water 'Society Girl Friday' Whitney MacNair getting kidnapped by Black Order honcho Dimitri Chilton.  Plenty of action and plot twists follow.  But the muscular hero is tepid and underdeveloped (that Whitney, after appearing in small doses in the previous series entries, is so well developed makes the poor fellow look even more like a cookie cutter stoic, tall, dark and handsome stereotype) and the battle of wits and brawn with the Black Order and its web of conspiracy takes center stage instead of the romance.  That means there's more chills n' thrills than passionate heat.  That complaint aside, this is a great read.  Recommended.	2002-06-26

The third entry in the four book Montana Confidential series will forever be linked with the events of 9/11...what with the opening bombing of a government building and the later stolen super-Anthrax subplot.  Nonetheless, author Douglas crafts a nailbiter of a story (one that I read in one day) that allows the forlorn single father Kyle Foster to shine in the line of duty.<br />When Kyle rescues Laura Quinlan and a group of trapped school children he has no idea that the woman will play a vital part in the search of the Black Order, Montana Confidential's Public Enemy Number One.  To help Kyle go undercover, Laura allows for a marriage of convenience and things heat up between the two.

Just what is it that Leia Organa and Han Solo see in each other?  What makes their love so strong?  Those questions, which would make for a decent plot, are largely ignored in The Courtship of Princess Leia, novelist Dave Wolverton's addition to the the Space Opera's constantly growing multi-media empire.<br />Han Solo returns from a hard five months of space battles to find that a suitor has come to offer his hand in marriage to Princess Leia.  The suitor comes from a rich cluster of planets that would prove beneficial to the Rebel Alliance and offer the Alderaan refugees (those off planet when it was destroyed by Grand Mof Tarkin in Episode IV: A New Hope) a possible new home.  Leia, who badly wants her guilt about Alderaan's destruction eased, seriously contemplates the offer.  Han responds by taking desperate (and almost thoroughly out of character) actions to win Leia back.<br />Individual moments in Courtship's storyline are better than the sum of its parts.  There's enough exciting action and political intrigue to hold interest and make the book an entertaining read, but it is severely hampered by Wolverton's obvious tin ear for the characters in the Star Wars franchise.  Just when the book gets cooking someone behaves in a manner that just seems wrong and the spell is broken.  The old cliche of &quot;Close, but no cigar&quot; is what describes this outing best.	2002-06-10

The Further Adventures of Batman is a theme anthology and it suffers from the same problem that befalls all of its genre.  Wildly uneven stories about the same subject matter.  Some of the tales contained in the book edge toward the camp of the maligned television series, while others are firmly rooted in the dark gothism of Tim Burton's first two film's in the series (which this and other DC comic character anthologies were tied in with).  Which story best captures the 'flavor' of Batman is, of course, highly subjective.  But the story by Joe R. Lansdale was the one that struck me as the best of the lot.  Recommended strictly to Batman fanatics.	2002-06-07

While it is true that Alan Dean Foster has crafted some fine, entertaining adventure stories in his long and distinguished career, Cat-A-Lyst isn't really one of them.  Words like cartoonish and juvenile descibe it best, but there is no doubt that this outlandish comedy will offer some fun for the feline fancier, but those looking for a more serious tale better give this one a very wide berth, it's as silly as they can get.  It reads as if Foster just jotted down some whimsical ideas while on a Peruvian vacation and then stitched them together with some book ended axe grinding at the movie and television industry (perhaps his stint as a Star Trek writer left him with some scars?).  Ostensibly it is the tale of one Jason Carter, a reluctant Hollywood Heartthrob who just wants to be taken seriously as an actor.  While filming a Civil War epic Carter finds a computer disc. Said disc contains hints of Peruvian treasure.  Thanks to a somewhat enigmatic and salty tongued costume matron (who isn't what she appears to be) and some convoluted research on her part Carter and Company are soon enough in the wilds of Peru, searching for the hinted at treasure and finding something quite different, thanks to a mysterious cat that pops up out of nowhere and tags along. Things go from the comedic to the downright silly in no time flat as alternated dimensions are discovered and intellectual carrots arrive on the scene.  Needless to say that, if you are in the mood for frenetically paced, feline focused cartoon fantasyu fun, then check Cat-A-Lyst out, you just might like it. Recommended, believe it or not.	2002-06-05

Whirlwind is an appropriate enough title for this first book in the twelve story cycle that is to make up Harlequin's Tyler series, for that is just how Liza Baron makes her entries.  Like a whirling dervish.<br />Broke and homeless, Liza Baron drives aimlessly through the night and winds up on the outskirts of the small Wisconsin town she thought she had left behind years ago.  Not ready to mend fences with her estranged family, Liza instead heads over to the now crumbling Timberlake Lodge, there she surprises the haunted recluse Cliff Forrester.  Verbal sparks fly between the seemingly mismatched couple and Liza decides to move in and restore the Timberlake (and Cliff) to past glory.  Easier said than done, especially when the remains of a dead body (Liza's missing Grandmother perhaps?) are discovered on the property.<br />Whirlwind constantly whips from heartwarming romance to creepy supsense and back again so fast your head might spin.  But author Nancy Martin never once looses her balance and crafts a wonder story that is a delight to read.  I look forward to visiting Tyler again and again.	2002-06-03

Seeing the blatant ruse for what it is, an escape attempt, Dr. Morgan recommends against it, despite polite warnings not to by Sloan Reeves (Fitzgerald's attorney).  Not one to be turned down or disappointed, Fitzgerald has Hayley's son kidnapped.  Sloan then informs her that she must change her decision and have Fitzgerald transfered if she wants her son back.<br />And Hayley is supposed to fall in love with this Sloan guy?  Sorry, I don't buy it and stopped reading this &quot;romance&quot; when Sloan laid down Fitzgerald's ultimatum.  Using the kidnapping of a child as the dramatic hook to bring to opposing people together for the purpose of falling in love is offensive, I did not care about the &quot;surprising twist&quot; (and any semi-regular reader of romantic suspense will clearly see it coming a mile away) and that Sloan would allow a monstrous crime like this to happen (no matter the long term goal his assignment requires) is a serious breach of both the law and ethics, making him less and less a hero in my eyes.  Sorry, but the author really bungled the suspense aspect of this story by trying a different approach.  I cannot recommend a book that so callously exploits a parent's worst nightmare.	2002-05-30

MacDonald's writing, as usual, sparkles with wit, insight, and tension.  Read any of MacDonald's novels and you'll see why he was such a highly respected author.  Recommended.	2002-05-30

Being a first time SW novel reader, Star Wars: The Truce at Bakura seemed like an excellent place to start, as it begins a mere 12 to 24 hours after the end of Return of the Jedi (which makes this novel Episode VII, I guess).<br />Still flush from the success of their critical attack against the Empire, the Rebel Alliance troops receive a distress beacon intended for the Emperor and his more powerful Death Star.  It seems the Rim World Bakura is under attack by a hostile and previously unknown race from outside the borders of the Empire controlled universe.  Seeing an excellent political, not to mention military, chance to shore up support for the Alliance in the coming chaos that will undoubtedly erupt following the spreading news of the Emperor's death, the usual suspects (Luke, Leia, Han, etc) round up and head out to aid the threatened planet.<br />As a Star Wars story this is a fairly routine, albeit fun, Space Opera filled with derring do and political intrigue.  Some reviewers may grumble that there was far too much political intrigue, but I thought that it was well handled and realistic considering the tale's timeline.  The book is filled with nice, little intelligent touches as well, like having the chief Imperial baddie not be some power mad Emperor wannabe.  I also liked how Luke suffered some debilitating fallout from his final face off with the Emperor and Leia had to face some serious anger issues stemming from discovering just who her father really was.  Sadly Han Solo doesn't get to do much except get jealous and shoot people (for different reasons, not jealousy).  Comic relief is provided by C-3PO and R2-D2, naturally.<br />The reptilian Ssi-ruuk get a pretty high register on the Hissable Villain Rating Scale, the \\"entechment\\" of their human prisoners is fairly blood curdling and only surpassed by their abusive treatment and constant brainwashing of their Force strong 'pet'/prisoner Dev (a sad character that ads a bitter dose of pathos to this grand adventure series chapter).<br />While giving five stars to The Truce at Bakura may prove (with further SW spin-off reading) a tad excessive, the novel was far too entertaining of a read for me to be comfortable with just four stars.  Recommended.adventure series chapter).<br />While giving five stars to The Truce at Bakura may prove (with further SW spin-off reading) a tad excessive, the novel was far too entertaining of a read for me to be comfortable with just four stars.

A routine analysis of an African Republic's mountain's ore content uncovers a motherlode of one of the most rare metals on the planet, platinum.  However the African Republic's government is a ruthless dictatorship, rabidly anti-western and pro-communist.  Facts that do not intimidate Sir James Manson, chairman/managing director of Manson Consolidated Mining Company Limited, in the least.  Not surprising when, even at dirt cheap prices, the mountain is worth ten billion dollars.  Eager to snag the mining rights, Manson quickly sets forth a rather unique plan.  Hire mercenaries to help overthrow the government, replace it with a pro-west puppet dictator, have a shell company buy up the mining rights to the mountain, have ManCon buy the shell company, and rake in the cash by the basket full.  Easier planned than done, as others quickly get their eyes on the same prize.<br />Frederick Forsyth narrates with a reporter's deadpan voice and backs up the seemingly outlandish story with a huge amount of detail that makes it all seem credible.  While the book does crackle with energy and keeps the pages turning, it lacked that something special to lift it up above the average page turner.  But fans of Cold War era Men of Adventure tales will be sure to love this, recommended.	2002-05-22

Montana Confidential Agent Court Brody goes undercover in a militia to see if they have connections with The Black Order (a vague multi-national terrorist organization), but when he discovers that his childhood sweetheart may have ties to the organization, and she knows he's an FBI Agent, his cover could be blown.  So begins a game of cat and mouse.  Both have secrets (thus creating suspense), Brody is undercover and Sabrina has had a child from their last rendevous.  Although the character's are well drawn and interesting, not having the primary suspense element (Brody verus the militia) have a direct link with the romantic plot hamstrings the book and makes it unfold in a segmented fashion.  It's not a bad romance story, it's just not a particularly strong romantic suspense one.	2002-05-14

Perry's first Resident Evil novel is a straight forward adaptation of the first game, perhaps a bit too straight forward.  The characters run through all the game's famous spooky and gruesome obstacles, but it lacks a certain dramatic punch.  Too often Perry opts to simply describe a brief run in with each of the game's threats and/or puzzles and then just rush on to the next one without any attempt at exploiting it for optimum suspense with a more drawn out battle and/or mental legwork.  Despite that sometimes irritating weakness, the book, like the game, is just too much fun of a ride to not recommend.  In the book's favor, Perry sketches in details and background that fleshes out the setting and characters quite nicely, leaving this reader hungry for more.  Good thing it's become a series, the book is as addictive as the game, I couldn't put it down.  Required reading for all Resident Evil fans.	2002-05-13

With a reunion coming up, detective Cal Rollins gets assigned to be Beth's 'husband' to sniff out clues to the killer's motive, if not the actual identity.

The author captures the flavor and broad humor of the film fairly well, it's easy to hear Will Smith's voice saying lines like &quot;Drop the shrubbery and come out with your trunks up.&quot;  But the profanity and gore is of the R rated variety, so the novel may be a tad advanced for the film's younger (but still literate) fans.

While The Forgiven does features a tight, emotionally well grounded mystery, I felt that the romance was a tad weak.  Perhaps it was the constraints of the category format, which only seemed to allow for one segment of the romantic suspense plotline to be examined.  Here it's the mystery, which, as I have already said, is quite good.  Alex and Naomi are sympathetic heroes, but some of their actions feel strange and unrealistic for people who are total strangers and facing such different legal challenges.  But these are minor quibbles, The Forgiven's individual moments are better than the sum of those parts and that, coupled with its cast of strong characters, makes the novel almost impossible to put down - I read it in one day.

Shannon Mulligan, hiding from an abusive and obsessed husband, has gone underground and tried to start a new life as a woman named Mary Calder.  What Shannon has no way of knowing though is that Mary Calder is dead, brutally murdered, and that the late woman's husband Luke, a police officer, has his wife's accounts flagged for attempted fraud.  When Shannon tries for a bank loan using Mary's name and credit history the warning flags go up and Luke sneaks in undercover to see if the woman using his wife's name knows anything about her murder.  Things get complicated when these two people with something to hide feel a fierce attraction to one another.<br />In His Wife's Name is a romantic suspense tale that emphasizes the romance over the suspense for most of the novel's storyline.  Not surprising, considering this is a romance novel, but I felt the mystery lacked a certain sizzle, though it did kick into high gear in the last quarter and my hands were as good as glued to the cover until I reached the end, so the book is far from a pedestrian outing.

I have been reading horror for well over twenty years and Cave's name is new to me, but discovering this writer late is way better than never, believe me.

Beman's story, despite some narrative wooziness (characters fade in and out of focus, events unfold unevenly) that may or may not be intentional (its like a discomforting nightmare), is tight and easy to read.  Each chapter ends on a cliffhanger that keeps the urge to turn the pages and find out what happens next strong.  The only downside is that the book is more divertingly creepy than out and out scary.

And that's a pretty strange recommendation to make for a movie novelization, it's supposed to be the other way around.  Following writer/director James Cameron's recommendation to write a real novel based on his story rather than just write it in narrative form (which so many writer-for-hire types do) Orson Scott Card crafted a well thought out expansion of the film's story.  In addition to having the pre-special edition cut sequences (which go a long way in explaining the abyss's residents motivations and such) Card also contributes some welcome background material for the main characters.  In an interesting note about the novel's origins (it was written during filming) Card shares that Cameron actually had the principle actors read their individual character's background material from Card's early drafts to better understand the inner workings he wanted communicated in their performances.

Michael Crichton's first, and wildly successful, novel to be published under his own name is a terrifying tale of an alien microbe, one that is toxic to earth residents, getting loose in northern Arizona.  In what would become a trademark storytelling style, Crichton describes the fictional events as actual occurrences, so the novel reads like non-fiction reportage.  Undoubtedly a few were suckered in by the realistic mimicry (ala the infamous Orson Welles War of the Worlds radio broadcast).  This faux realism keeps the novel pulsating with energy even today, some thirty years after its original publication, helping retain its narrative edge.  A brilliant and highly recommended debut.	2002-03-04

Reprisal represents a pretty serious shift in the Adversary Cycle's tone and focus.

The Evil One has been reborn and, in an interesting twist, decides to have some fun torturing a surviving character from Reborn by defiling and destroying those close to him.  These assaults are pretty spine chilling in their utterly soulless ferocity and, as one review points out, may offend some feint of heart readers.

The result is a breathtaking six book Cycle about something very evil trying to end the world.<br />A struggling horror novelist receives a surprising inheritance and some heartbreaking news about his parentage.

He finds himself in a particularly gruesome mess when the family of his estranged girlfriend (she does not approve of his rogue vigilantism) is marked for death by a revenge seeking Indian.  Lots of action, monsters, and narrow escapes follow.  Highly recommended.	2002-03-01

David Seltzer once again wrote a novel based on his script for a major studio horror feature.  As with his work on The Omen, Prophecy actually reads like a novel and not just a script in narrative form.  It is also quite superior to the film version, but then so is most other monster tales.  Ferocious mutants terrorize Indians, lumberjacks, and EPA investigators in the woods of Maine.  Recommended reading for all monster buffs.	2002-03-01

Several characters are taken from the opening montage of The Final Conflict and dispatched in clumsy 'accidents' before the novel stumbles to its conclusion.

Producer/Director Irwin Allen, eager to score a hit after flopping with the embarrassing failure of The Swarm, evidently backed Paul Gallico into a corner and sweet talked the author into penning a sequel to The Poseidon Adventure that would hopefully stimulate interest in financing another Poseidon Adventure feature film.  Gallico, either making up the concept himself or working from ideas sculpted by Allen's screenwriters, cooked up a moderately entertaining sequel to the movie itself, rather than his novel, which ended quite differently.  It's better written than one would expect for something with such crass origins, and, in a humorous touch, Gallico dedicated the novel to Mr. Allen.

The gang is all here as the Evil One opens portal after portal to bring about the end of the world.  What is amazing is that Wilson pulls imaginative monster and menace out of his sleeve left and right with seemingly little effort as he ups the stakes again and again, building to a full out battle to save the world from the nastiest collection of elder gods and cronies that you would ever hope not to meet (some of these things are really bloodcurdling).

Fear Nothing is the first book in what looks to be a trilogy.  Christpher Snow, the standard self-deprecating yet inhumanly resourceful hero of any and all Koontz stories, discovers a hideous conspiracy on the night of his father's death.  Koontz drops lots of hints and quips as he unfolds a story not at all dissimilar to his novels Night Chills, Watchers, and Midnight (among others), but it is mostly tease and portent, the book raising more questions than it does answers, so be prepared to be left hanging.  I was not overly impressed with the novel, but, as is usually the case, the characters are likable, the action and suspense levels quite high, and the mystery maintains interest.  The only really sloppy part is that the story takes place over the course of a single night, something that, considering all the exposition Snow must take in and places he must visit, is just impossible to believe.  Nonetheless its a brisk, fun read with just the right amount of nastiness to give the suspense a credible edge.	2002-02-28

He escapes to his past, returning to his childhood home and searching out his teenage crush Peggy Ann Snow, now a grown woman in a troubled and rapidly dissolving marriage.  In an isolated cabin rental, Corky makes his tragic last stand.  A wonderful novel that manages to both be a melancholic love story as well as a harrowing psychological thriller.

As the fire climbs closer and the situation grows grimmer, the characters true natures are revealed, and some are not pretty.

It's too bad that most people will recognize the title only from Irwin Allen's Golden Turkey Award winning (for Most Badly Bumbled Bee Movie) adaptation rather than from Arthur Herzog's excellent source novel.

Quickly they spread across the country and begin posing a serious threat to the nation's safety.  Can the bees be destroyed without harming the citizens or the enviroment?  If you are looking for edge of your seat suspense then forget Allen's movie (which is good only for a laugh, believe me - it's my biggest guilty pleasure) and read this book, it is one of the best animal (or in this case insect) attack stories ever written.	2002-02-27

The opening pages, wherein an oil tanker collides with one of the towers of the Golden Gate Bridge and spills tons of crude into the San Francisco Bay, are pure suspense and realistic action.  Sadly the multiple stories that follow are standard disaster thriller filler.  The novel is far from boring, it's just that it suffers from the same problems with contrivance and characterization that plague other 'cast of thousands' disaster epics.  This is strictly for those that can't stop themselves from watching The Poseidon Adventure or The Towering Inferno whenever it pops up on cable.	2002-02-27

WWIII breaks out and, in a spine tingling opening, London is flattened by a nuclear bomb.  As survivors as well as the walking dead (i.e. those suffering from the slow death of radiation poisoning) struggle out of the rubble, the giant rats once again arise to feed.<br />In this final entry in the rats saga, bestselling British horror novelist James Herbert expertly combines the then popular post apocalyptic survival yarn with the standard rats action for a truly awesome read.  His vignette narrative style is perfectly suited for the location hopping that the epic scope of the story calls for.  One chapter in particular, concerning a survivor in a sealed off bomb shelter with a most unwelcome cat for a companion, has been reprinted as a short story in several horror anthologies.  Even if you have not read the previous entries, and, considering that the rats themselves are the only returning characters, you don't need to, any fan of action laced horror will find something to enjoy here.  Herbert was at the height of his game with this novel and I give it my highest recommendation.	2002-02-27

Considering the current fascination with nutrition, dieting, and eating disorders this 1982 novel by speculative suspense writer Arthur Herzog (The Swarm, Heat, and Earthsound) needs to be rediscovered and widely read.  A new dietary supplement, Sovren, has an unforseen side effect...it makes its users uncontrollably hungry. When they begin literally eating themselves to death trying to satiate a hunger that will not fade, the corporate powers that be want the facts buried.  Meanwhile the doctor who invented the miracle weight loss shake falls victim to it himself in a classic Frankenstein twist.<br />Although Herzog had his weaknesses as a writer, namely having a deus ex machina parked in each of his story's garage, he was a master at the slow burn terror.  Hints and clues build atop each other as the inevitable fallout gathers.  A memorable book worth seeking out by medical suspense lovers everywhere.	2002-02-27

Granted the film adaptation by Irwin Allen is a classic of its kind, but Paul Gallico's source novel is so, so much more than a mere adventure novel.  The Poseidon Adventure is also a dark psychological novel about the human will and the human character, how it constantly shifts and changes, yet remains the same at its very core.  Don't be fooled by the swift pace and high adventure, careful reading of this excellent piece of entertainment will be a richly rewarding experience for you.  Highly recommended.	2002-02-27

This slim, grim piece of b-movie trash (and believe me, I mean that in the most positive and respectful way) actually launched a sub-genre in the british horror novel industry - the mutant pet and/or pest novel.  The next few years would see bookshelves stuffed with grue dripping books about killer cats, dogs, bats, crabs, slugs (yes, I said slugs), spiders, jellyfish, and assorted other nasties.  For this alone Herbert's novel deserves some kind of special recognition.<br />The novel itself was written, by hand I believe, on a lark.  In one interview Herbert even admitted to not even bothering to do a rewrite!  The story is simple: giant mutant rats gobble down assorted victims as, in between the gruesome attacks, scientists and members of the government scratch their heads and wonder how to do away with the seemingly indestructable beasties.  In what would grow to be a trademark storytelling style, Herbert lavishes as much character detail on the victims to be as he does on the actual characters.  An essential book for animal on the rampage buffs and rodent lovers everywhere.	2002-02-26

But the violent, babbling madman that is dragged from the trench afterwards gives everyone a hint as to the horrors that are to come.  It seems that a bacterial weapon has gotten loose and, as it interacts with the air, the mist thickens into a roaming, yellowish fog that drives any and all exposed to it mad.  As entire communities fall victim to its horrible effects, the authorities wonder how it can be stopped.  James Herbert's second novel is just as much a zesty sex laced blood bath as his first and it makes a great double bill with Richard Layman's One Rainy Night.	2002-02-26

William Peter Blatty's sequel to his own smasheroo success The Exoricst only shows how impossible it is to adequately follow up a knocked-out-of-the-ballpark pop culture influencing piece of work.  Certainly the novel is intelligent and provokes thought, but the theology is nothing particularly new or interesting and the mixture of plots and sub-plots (involving apparently undead serial killers, brain tumors and/or traumas, as well as a fish in a bath tub) are convoluted and aggravating instead of intriguing and suspense building.  Nonetheless Legion is one of the better (if not the best) of The Exorcist sequels and fans will no doubt want to take a look, just don't expect to be as deeply unsettled as you were the first time around and you probably won't be too disappointed.	2002-02-26

While knowing who the sentinel is and what she is there for robs the story of the first's rich vein of suspense and mood, author Jeffrey Konvitz compensates by throwing some stunning curve balls in the story's latter half. While nowhere near as compelling, not to mention frightening and seemingly confusing, as the first novel was, The Guardian nonetheless offers an entertaingly twisted story that almost satisfies. Almost because the book reads like the middle part of a trilogy that never materialized, oh well it's still worth hunting down.	2002-02-26

Shirely Jackson was a gifted writer who deserves to be regarded with the same prestige heaped upon Ray Bradbury and others.  Come Along With Me, a posthumous collection gathering together early works with lectures and a novel fragment, not only allows readers to shiver and giggle as only Ms. Jackson could make us do, it also offers the reader an intimate glimpse into the creative process (compare the sharp focus in the revised segments of Come Along With Me with the somewhat blurred unrevised sections) and, by printing short stories in order of their publication, the growth of Ms. Jackson's considerable talent for the intelligently ghoulish can be seen and savored.  As with her other, more famous stories (i.e The Haunting of Hill House), it is what is implied in the methodical unfolding of the tales that makes for the chills rather than in your face grue.  This book, along with Jackson's others, is an essential in any literature loving bookworm's library.  Highest recommendation.	2002-02-25

Jeffrey whips out a calculator and the Bible and gives the reader a dizzying amount of verse quotation and fuzzy math to show how biblical prophecy follows Jewish Holy days. His theories are certainly interesting, but the style of writing in the edition I read was stiff and headache inducing (Mr. Jeffrey seems to have matured somewhat as a writer, if the few excerpts I have read from his other books can be taken as good examples).

It's obvious that, prior to, or perhaps during, production the cult classic monster movie The Boogens got a hefty rewrite.  This novelization of the film's early script gives its fans a chance to see what might have been.  While the basic concept is the same, the reopening of an abandoned mine unleashes a horde of tentacled beasts, the cast is larger and includes an easy to hate villian, the monsters are far more gross (unlike the toothsome critters in the film, these boogens are tentacled pods, think jellyfish, that digest their strangled prey by sitting on them - yuck), and the tone far darker.  Fans of the film will no doubt find this an interesting read.  Recommended.	2002-02-15

It contains all the elements that the writer's fans expect and love...a dysfunctional family, teen (or pre-teen) angst, a gothic/small town setting, a dollop of the supernatural (that would turn technological within a few books) hidden within a mystery that goes back into the town's early history, and murder.<br />Once again a troubled family moves to a small town in the hopes of starting fresh.  Sadly their adopted daughter's inner emotional turmoil attracts the restless and revenge thristing spirit of a blind girl that met a tragic end nearly one hundred years ago (hence the title).  As the girl's sanity weakens the spirit grows stronger and the bodies began piling up.  Saul's fourth novel (following Suffer the Children, Punish the Sinners, and Cry for the Strangers) is one of his best, a tight and polished thriller that delivers the chills.  Recommended.	2002-02-11

You have an elderly man coping with his wife's death as well as a worsening case of insomnia that is causing him to see...things.  An underdeveloped subplot on wife beating.  Supposedly pro-life terrorists plotting to destroy a family planning clinic.  And, finally, you have the powers of both The Random and The Purpose (New Agese translations being Random = Evil, Purpose = Good) battling to sway the outcome to their favor because, you see, someone in this big mess has serious, Big Picture connections to Roland and Company's quest to save The Dark Tower.<br />Sounds good, doesn't it?  Well it isn't.  Insomnia is overlong (taking hundreds of pages to over development rather simple ideas) , prone to needless subplot digressions (in the midst of one important scene we stop for seemingly endless amounts biographical data on every item in Ralph's closet while he searches for binoculars), and, worst of all, it's treatment/development of the female characters borders on the misogynistic.<br />King constantly amazes me with how he can take dozens of characters, make each and every one them important to the plot, and crosslink seemingly random events in even the smallest of stories to create the illusion of epic meaning.  But in Insomnia he fumbled the narrative horribly, creating an embarrassing failure to be avoided.	2002-01-31

When Joan Hapgood's mother Emily, who is suffering from Alzheimer's, nearly burns down her home, Joan thinks she has no choice but to take her mother into her own home. It is a decision she will come to regret. It seems that Emily, who can no longer tell reality and memory apart, is obsessively attached to her deceased first daughter, Cynthia. The woman is convinced that Cynthia is coming back or has already returned.<br />The stress of having the woman in the home fractures the Hapgood marriage (a tad too quickly, but John Saul has never been one for in depth psychological character studies) and knocks Joan's son Matt off his emotional balance. The boy is plagued by nightmares, visions, and blackouts. When people begin to die during these blackouts Matt questions his sanity. Also Cynthia's visits become more aggressive. Are the Hapgood's haunted, or is Matt just loosing his mind from weak parenting (check out just how quickly he is abandoned by his stepfather and how his mother caves into the slightest pressure from her own mother) and psychological abuse.<br />With Nightshade, pop thriller storyteller John Saul returns to the gothic, supernatural laced psychological thrillers that made him both famous and rich. It is a welcome return that, while not as effective as some of his classic novels (i.e. Comes the Blind Fury or When the Wind Blows), is nonetheless highly entertaining and recommended.

When Stephen King and Peter Straub joined literary forces in the eighties, fans were expecting the ultimate horror novel.  What the then Dynamic Duo of Horror delivered was something entirely different.  The Talisman was an epic fantasy of parallel worlds, only touched with horror, that, in the years since the tale was first told, King has continually mapped out in his Dark Tower series of novels.  Black House, unsurprisingly, is closely connected to those novels.<br />Now, when fans expect another epic fantasy, what King and Straub deliver is a gruesome horror novel with fantasy underpinnings.  Black House has the now grown Jack Sawyer chasing after The Fisherman, a serial killer that also eats his young victims.  But larger forces are at play here, forces that mean to topple the Dark Tower.  The ride is harrowing (some scenes are just painful to read), but also long and, at times, painfully short.  King and Straub lavish detail on minor plot points, yet, as the climax approaches, they appear to skim over some details to get the readers to the action that has been some five hundred pages in coming.  But despite its slight shortcomings, Black House is a smart, literate horror fantasy that will satisfy more fans than it will disappoint.  Best of all, it appears to be the second volume of a trilogy.  Recommended.	2002-01-21

Carpenter, Ted Bundy, as well as the Night Stalker, to name but a few), but only Jeffrey Dahmer has come anywhere close to igniting a revulsion of horror at that shear twistedness of his crimes.<br />Harold Schechter does an incredible job at detailing the life of the sick, sad soul whose crimes, as well the urban legends spawned by them (i.e. the practice of cannibalism and taxidermy), gave birth to a slew of fictional, and quite popular, cinematic serial predators (Psyho's Norman Bates, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre's Leatherface, and The Silence of the Lambs's Buffalo Bill to name but a few).  The author is also quite careful to separate the true crimes from the sensational hyperbole that erupted after their discovery.  He also paints a sad portrait of the tortured family life where Gein's strange mental illness was formed, so that the reader not only comes away from this unputdownable book knowing the monstrous actions.  We also know the sad, twisted, and lonely little man behind the monster.  Highly recommended.	2002-01-03

Relic follows monster story conventions fairly closely, so an informed read can guess as to what is going to happen next with a good degree of accuracy.

After Howard Lovecraft's untimely death in 1937, August Derleth fought to keep the man's work and Mythos alive.  In addition to republishing the original tales, Derleth also completed unfinished stories and created others from Lovecraft's notes and outlines.  The Trail of Cthulhu is a series of linked stories regarding the efforts of Dr. Laban Shrewsbury, Andrew Phelan, and others to thwart the awakening of the mighty sleeping Cthulhu.  Derleth imitates Lovecraft's verbose writing style so poorly that it reads almost as a parody rather than the well intentioned expansion of the Mythos that was intended.  Derleth also goes into such detail, leaves so little to the imagination, and is so repetitive in his narratives, that it robs the stories of any real suspense, foreboding, or fear.  As big a fan of Lovecraft as I am, this book was a disappointment and a real chore to finish.  I can only recommend this to other Cthulhu enthusiasts, and then only to those that, after having emptied the well completely, still find themselves thristing for more of the shunned Old Ones.  Otherwise skip it, you will not miss it, believe me.	2001-12-17

Star Trek V: The Final Frontier arguably had the silliest of plot concepts, and the touches of buffoonish humor did not help the movie much either.<br />Sybok, a renegade Vulcan from Spock's past, has managed to seize Nimbus III, the 'Planet of Intergalatic Peace'.  But it is a ruse, what he really needs is a starship to take him to the center of the galaxy.  Once there, Sybok believes he will meet God.<br />Dillard attempts to fill in the many character gaps in Shatner's Kirk centered story, giving each brainwashed member of the crew a chance to have center stage and a moment to shine.  Thus it is more of an ensemble piece than the film.  Dillard also clarifies some of the fuzzy plot points, making the hijacking and trip to God a tad easier to believe.  There is also an honorable attempt to fit the concept of Nimbus III into the Trek Mythos rather than having it just be a gimmick jumping off point for the story.  But despite all this hard work this novel is worthwhile reading only for those who would like to see a silly story told in a more well thought out manner.  Strictly for Trek buffs.	2001-12-13

The pseudo-epic tale follows the planet and its inhabitants from its literal creation on through to the working out of the Vulcan government's current troubles with the Federation (cagily rooted in a particular episode of the original series).<br />How well the novel adheres to the Trek Mythos I will leave to those more well versed in its complex and multiple series spanning arc.

When Harry Briggs dies he finds himself playacting the role of hardboiled P.I. in the afterlife, searching for a 'missing' woman.  But as Harry adjusts to the afterlife, his imagination begins to spice things up.  It creates a super villain for his P.I. persona to track, a serial killer that looks like more than a bit like 40's noir character actor Sydney Greenstreet.  Things take a turn for the worse when Harry's 'rat puppy' (read the novel and find out what it means) breaks its leash and crosses over to the corporeal world, racking up victims that begin clogging the engimatic afterlife Harry has stumbled into.<br />Sleepeasy is part of the slightly connected cycle of Dark Fantasy afterlife/ghost novels, which include A Manhattan Ghost Story and The Waiting Room, that T.M. Wright has been writing over the years.  Each novel is a well crafted tale that is a delight to read (if you are in the mood for surreal, reality bending supernatural antics that walk the tightrope between playful and frightening that is), but gain more power when seen as a part of a larger, more complex vision.  T.M. Wright is a dark fantasist that deserves a much larger readership than he has now.  Highly recommended.	2001-12-12

Mr. Spock gets zapped back in time to the founding of Seattle, Washington, where the Klingons plan on assassinating someone who has great importance in the forming of future events.  Too bad the jolt has given the Vulcan amnesia.  As Kirk and crew search for their missing Science Officer, Spock tries to fit into an alien world he has no idea is truly alien to him.  Hambly has great fun with the silly premise (letting Spock rub elbows with some actual historic characters, including San Francisco's adopted Emperor, is a real nice touch) and makes for an entertaining time waster.

This book within a book tells how the truce between the Klingons and the Federation was formed.  It takes place some forty or so years before the first Trek television series and features the main characters (Kirk, Spock, and McCoy) only in small, yet highly important, cameos.  I read this novel around the time that Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country was released in theaters and found the distinct parallels between the two, if you can pardon the pun, fascinating.  I'm not a huge fan (i.e. constant reader) of the Star Trek novels, but am always willing to give anything a try once, this is one time I am glad I did.  Recommended.	2001-12-11

Once again Charles Grant takes the reader on a chill inducing visit to his haunted town of Oxrun.  The Pilgrim's Travelers Carnival has arrived and it is something to see, just stay away from the Carousel, as the quartet of novellas introduced by Oxrun's resident, and always anonymous, writer and reluctant historian repeatedly warn.  Like Ray Bradbury's 'Something Wicked this Way Comes', which a cover blurb compares this novel/collection to, Grant's The Black Carousel is a sweetly melancholic and unsettling reading experience.  New readers beware, you are in for an addictive treat.  One that should be read while wrapped in a blanket so you can try and smother the chills it will give you.  Also be prepared to start combing the used book racks for Grant's other Oxrun titles, you'll be wanting to visit Oxrun again and again.  Highly recommended.	2001-12-04

Frankly I did not care enough to find out.<br />Evidently Douglas Clegg's novel was an e-serial, which explains the fragmented and inconsistent narrative flow of the novel and how it seems more tease than actual terror.

It has been almost a year and a half since Natalie Windsor's husband was brutally murdered while answering a prowler call at a deserted house (then who placed that call reporting the prowler?) and her life is just about returned to normal.  Then another dead body is found, mutilated just has her late husband's body had been.<br />Charles L. Grant is an acknowledged master of character based, gothic atmosphere drenched 'quiet horror' (the kind that relies on misdirection, mystery, and mood).  But The Hour of the Oxrun Dead, despite having a listed copyright of 1987 on the information page of the Tor paperback edition I have, is one of the earliest Oxrun novels from the late seventies (I clearly remember seeing a copy of the book sometime around 1979 or 80).  One that was obviously written well before Grant had a really firm grip on his gothic mood based style of writing.  Nonetheless Grant's fans will find any visit to the haunted town of Oxrun well work making, and this one certainly is.  Recommended.	2001-11-21

One is the tale of the origins of a unique werewolf, the other is that now adult werewolf working as a spy for England in WW2.  Neither plays well with the other.  The book also suffers from an 11th hour back to his roots subplot that just makes the story drag on even longer, mainly due to its needlessly repeating events already explored in the character's childhood.  This is one 'epic' that is far too padded to do its stories justice.	2001-11-20

Something that would make the reader's jaw drop and make them think 'I can't believe that I'm reading this.'&quot; - Peter Straub on writing Floating Dragon.<br />Well Mr. Straub you have succeeded.<br />Floating Dragon was, at the time, Straub's last foray into supernatural horror (Mr. X marks his return to the field that made him famous).  As an ancient, paranormal thing awakens to again wreak havoc on an accursed town, an equally horrid nerve gas escapes and infects the population of said town.  How much of the events of this story are really happening and how much is collective hallucination brought upon by the gas?  The question is not answered by Straub, who leaves a great deal to the reader to figure out.  But the clues are there, you just have to dig past all the symbolic and over the top effects scenes (of which there is a HUGE amount).  Granted Floating Dragon may not be Straub's best novel, but even his lesser efforts are far superior to other horror writers successes.	2001-11-20

Punish the Sinners is a thriller concerning a rash of suicides and religious fervor sweeping through a desert community (the heat is symbolic on many levels).

Black Butterflies is a collection of overtly horrific stories written by cyberpunk pioneer John Shirley. Sadly the tales are evenly divided into either 'This World' or 'That World' sections, allowing the reader to know in advance whether there is to be a supernatural twist or not, which robs the stories of more than a little zing of surprise.<br />Weakness of presentation aside, the stories themselves are a mixed bag. Some, notably 'What Would You Do For Love' (which could qualify as a cyberpunk romance story), the commute nightmare 'Cram', and the real life inspired 'War and Peace', are quite fresh and invigorating. While others, 'The Rubber Smile' especially (which shares an identical irony laced ending with Shirley's early horror novel 'Cellars'), are nothing but shop worn cliches trotted out yet again and presented as if they were hip and fresh, which they aren't. More than a few are variants on a particular theme and suffer from being too close together (i.e. 'You Hear What Buddy and Ray Did?' and 'The Footlite' in particular). In the end though, Shirley's strong and distinct voice does give each dark hearted tale its own unique character that sticks with the reader long after the tale is done. The Horror Noir crowd should find it interesting.	2001-11-19

This novelization of the mediocre sequel to one of the most successful independent horror movies of all time is a mixed bag.  It is filled with spooky, late night atmosphere and tries hard to build tension and suspense from the filmsy story delivered by screenwriters John Carpenter and Debra Hill.  On some levels it does succeed where the movie failed in sustaining suspense and atmosphere, but the lack of a strong story to anchor the events renders the chills meaningless.

Just as Black Oak is rehired to again continue the thirteen year old search for mulit-millionare Taylor Blaine's missing daughter Celeste and her two friends, Ethan Proctor recieves a message from an old friend of his father's in Georgia.  It seems that the retired teacher found a resemblance between Maude Tackett (one of the missing trio) and a local retailing New Age Witch named Maudie Batts, who also happens to have gone missing recently, an apparent victim of what looks to be a serial killer who enjoyings acting like a werewolf.  Or is it a real werewolf?  Too bad Proctor's father's teacher friend is missing as well, another apparent victim of the werewolf.<br />Charles Grant delivers another exceptional episode (#5) of Black Oak in When the Cold Wind Blows.  The series, after a few slightly clumsy footed introductions to the cast and the seemingly interlinked conspiracies, has really hit its stride.  The novel is a well tuned engine that hums right through the intricate knots of its mysteries, dropping hints and clues that will keep the reader whipping through the pages until the rousing finale.  The entire series is required reading for Dark Fantasy fans.	2001-11-15

This tormentor also chooses to harass Dix's longtime friend Francesca and her daughter Amy.  The harassment escalates to murder as Dix and Francesca try to find out who among their supposed friends is the tormentor.<br />Bill Pronzini's novel feels like an early book given a polish and republished, not unlike what Dean Koontz had been doing with his back stocked library.  But the results here, while entertaining (Pronzini is a fine writer), feel outdated, considering all the changes in communications technology to better deal with these situations.  Reading the book is like slipping into a pair pajamas and lounging in front of the television to watch one of those generic made for cable suspense thrillers when you feel like doing nothing else.  An adequate time passer for non-discriminating thriller fans on rainy three day weekends.	2001-11-10

But the surviving adversaries from Symphony (book 1), In the Mood (book 2), and Chariot (book 3) are coming together, albeit it reluctantly, to head the horsemen off at the pass.  The final battle for the fate world will be waged, as is the case in all of Grant's stories (both in the series and out), in some small, off the beaten path town.  Again emphasis is placed on atmosphere and character, story always being something of a weak point in Grant's writing.

Too often the monster attacks play flat and it is hard to understand what is happening during them.  Not at all surprising when you consider the rumors that this production was actually adaptated from a screenplay by Dennis Etchison and not originally intended as a radio drama.  Making matters worse is the actor playing the main character's son.  The child has an irritatingly congested voice, I kept wanting him to take a sudafed and blow his nose before saying his lines.  The material screams for better script writing and presentation.  Die hard Stephen King fans will find this of interest, but others should continue to wait for the movie.  Better yet, just read the story.  Now THAT'S scary.	2001-10-31

It has been two years since The Trouble, when a Great White shark swam into the waters off of Amity and refused to go away, and the town is just starting to recover.  What no one knows is that another shark has entered into the waters and is making itself just as much at home as the first one did.  This novelization is adapted from the script by Dorothy Tristan and Howard Sackler.  However Tristan had to leave the project when her husband, director John Hancock, was replaced by Jeannot Szwarc and Jaws screenwriter Carl Gottlieb was called in to do a massive rewrite, in the end only co-screenwriter Howard Sackler retained credit.  While many events in the completed film can be glimpsed in this story (two photograph taking scuba divers attacked at the wreck of the Orca, the picture they take of the shark becoming an important plot point later, a water skier gets gulped and the speedboat blows up, a scuba diver bumps into the shark and shoots to the surface way too fast, a helicopter gets yanked under, and a group of shark bait kids are attacked and trapped at sea during a boat race), but their context within the discarded storyline are radically different.  Author Hank Searls adds a welcome amount of detail to the story, some, such as getting into the mind of both the shark and a harbor seal searching for its lost child, foreshadow his masterful whale novel Soundings.  The book is somewhat better written than Benchley's source novel, but it does not contain the visceral terror of the original, then again how could it?  Nonetheless, Jaws fans should seek this out, just to see what could have been a far better sequel.  Recommended.	2001-10-29

Only one man, Sheriff Martin Brody, chooses to stand up to both the shark and the town, for which he pays a hefty price.<br />Jaws is not high literature, it's just a brisk thrill ride of a novel.  One that tapped something deep inside the audience of its day and proved that monster stories could acheive mass market success.  The novel still works, especially whenever the shark rears it ugly snout and bares its teeth.  Highly recommended.	2001-10-29

People were being maimed and slaughtered from left to right and the most I could think was...&quot;is anything interesting going to happen?&quot;  When what I was thinking hit me I began to wonder if that was what Ellis had intended to do, have the reader experience the thrill, then the empty boredom, that his narrator Patrick Bateman obviously experienced.  If that was the case then he succeeded.  Everything else is more miss than hit.  There is funny run in with a college student that Patrick mistakes for a homeless person, as well as an attempt at murder that is mistaken for a homosexual seduction, and his musings regarding the artistic validity of Whitney Houston, Huey Lewis and The News, and Phil Collins are quite snicker inducing as well.  But they don't add up to a strong enough book to recommend to any but the curious interested in seeing what all the fuss the novel kicked up was about.	2001-10-26

Graham Masterton's first horror novel introduced not only a pretty memorable monster (and hysterically funny film adaptation), but also the template plot off all of Masterton's tales to follow.<br />&quot;A series of increasingly paranormal events leads a character (here one Harry Eskrine) to discover that an elder god (here one evil Medicine Man) is about to return and take over/destroy the world.  As time runs out a team of sorts (here a well meaning doctor and a contemporary Medicine Man) is formed to try and stop the beast's return, but they are late getting to the pass and our hero (Harry) must do personal battle with the hellish entity to save the world.&quot;<br />It's a formula that works beautifully, no matter which elder god monster Masterton decides to pull from the shadows of fictional legend.  That Masterton has a sense of humor about all this hogwash is a bonus, making The Manitou (and others) both scary AND funny.  Highly recommended.	2001-10-23

Bill Roberts is a laconic and none to smart loser that decides to rob a firecracker stand just across the street because his mother is now dead and stinking up the place and he cannot get the nerve up to forge her social security checks to get the money, which he is just about out of.  With two cohorts helping him out, the robbery goes well for about two seconds.  Then things go south in a hurry.  Four corpses later, poor Bill stumbles out of the swamp and into a traveling carnival Freakshow run by a kind hearted man with a hand growing out of his chest and his femme fatale wife.  Hoping to hide out until things cool down in the real world, Bill takes a job there and waits for the proper angles to present themselves.  Gidget, the blonde bombshell wife of the show's owner, has some plans of her own as well as some very nice angles to get them done.<br />Freezer Burn is largely a retelling of the film 'Freaks' as a comedic roman noir.  Chock full of unsavory characters that view humane behavior as stupid and weak, this is certainly not a novel for all tastes.  Longtime Lansdale fans will be delighted to see him brush up on his darker roots, the ones responsible for The Nightrunners and the black as tar noir nightmare The Night They Skipped the Horror Show.  Others used to the trace of nobility found in his most recent work will wonder why he wasted his time telling the tale of such an unlikable sociopath anti-hero.  Being a nearly twenty year Lansdale addict I heartily recommend to his longtime fans as well as to those who just like dark hearted noir with a goofball twist.	2001-10-22

The search for a special kind of diamond in the Congo uncovers a lost civilization overlorded by murderous Great White Apes with nearly humanlike intelligence.

This may be a kinder, gentler Godzilla tale, one that retells segments of the first film (sans Raymond Burr) from the perspective of a group of children, but it is slow and uneven.  The second book in the series - Godzilla Invades America - is somewhat of an improvement and closer in tone to the latter day kiddie matinee Godzilla films than this premiere is.  There is the usual amount of city stomping, but no one is seriously hurt and a predominantly sympathetic tone for Godzilla will keep the bad dreams away.

Michael Crichton's novel is far better than the shallow thrill ride the movie had to be.  Dark and sinister from page one, this novel follows the characters on a fast rollercoaster of awe and terror as a wealthy and arrogant industrialist attempts to clone and exploit dinosaurs.  An attempted act of espionage combined with a whopper of a tropical storm unleashes the dangerous animals and those at the island resort of Jurassic Park must fight for their lives.

Although Crichton's feather light prose does have difficulty with the character development and set-up, once the action takes over it moves at a gallop, contains a number of sweep the rug out from under you twists, and more than a few Jaws type thrills.  This all question and no answer concept potpourri contains everything but the kitchen sink and, in the reading, would seem to be the basis for a great movie.  But, as with Congo, such was not the case.  Recommended to aquatic thriller fans.	2001-10-17

Make no mistake about it, The Lost World was written simply to make a huge amount of money for its author.  Lots of mayhem and narrow escapes, but it feels forced and contrived.  The characters reaction to the dinos is listless and, unless directly in harms way, almost emotionless.  Still when Crichton does whip out the teeth and claws it's a fairly exciting waste of time, just not the experience of the first book.

It starts off running and never really stops, the book is almost exhausting to read.<br />The plot is pure b-movie pulp.  Hitler uses an unstable chemical weapon that, ala The Andromeda Strain, turns blood to dusty clots in the veins of victims.  Too bad it spreads and kills everyone in the world, except for a lucky few.  The luckiest of the dead died quick, in a matter of minutes.  But some live on, clots slowly forming throughout their bloodstream and causing gangrene and other nasty and terribly slow ways to die.  It is from these last few, and quite insane, hangers on that our mixed bag of immune heroes must alternate between fleeing and fighting.<br />Most of the novel uses plot points taken from either the cult classic Mad Max or the cheese classic The Omega Man.  It's a quick enough read that is easy to forget.  Mr. Herbert may have written far better books, but this one is as about as exciting as a plate of literary whipped cream can get.  Recommended to those looking for light, fast paced, and exciting reading.	2001-10-16

Psyho-paths features across the board (from black humored over to simply pitch black horror noir) stories from many talented and respected writers in the dark fantasy genre.  The book does start off well with the hilarious Bloch roast &quot;Them Bleaks&quot;, but then proceeds to slide rapidly downhill from there.  The big problem for me being the core sameness of each story, even if there was a twist it revolved around revealing that one character was, gasp!, a PSYCOPATH!  This is a problem that cannot be avoided in theme anthologies and, I believe, how attached you are to the particluar theme dictates just how successful the anthology will be for you in the end.  The only other tale that really tickled my fancy was Charles Grant's, which contains the bare bones idea for his road predator novel &quot;Jackals&quot;.  Recommended solely to psycho stories buffs and those hardcore fans that will read anything by the writers they they idolize.	2001-10-16

Make no mistake about it, The Girl that Loved Tom Gordon is a nail biter of a story.  I just thought that King stumbled a bit in trying having to have the story both ways, having the threat be both natural and supernatural.  Granted this is a &quot;Stephen King&quot; story, so gross outs and ghouls are to be expected and welcomed.  I just felt that the book was a tad too sketchy in its use of the ghoul and that the scares would have been made more hair raising if a lighter touch had been used.  I was however quite amused that this novel's original hardback release coincided with the early theatrical playdates for The Blair Witch Project, another lost in the woods tale with a concept not too dissimilar from King's.	2001-10-16

Vampires are always a hot ticket item and guarantee a certain level of sales and good sales means that there will be interest in another volume and interest in another volume means working writers continue to work.  This is a good thing and Under the Fang is a decent enough theme anthology, if you love vampires that is (and if you do you've probably read it already and don't need my review to sway your purchasing opine one way or the other).  I don't, in fact vampires bore me terribly.<br />Boredom with blood guzzlers from the grave aside, I found Under the Fang an entertaining diversion.  There is little terror to be found, though McCammon's apocalyptic opening did come close to unleashing shivers up and down my spine.  The only other stories that really did anything for me were the tales by J.N. Williamson and the late, great Richard Laymon.  Strictly for vampire fans.	2001-10-16

'Fans' expecting a gruesome bloodbath of a thrill ride will be sorely disappointed, for Psycho is nothing more than a brisk and smartly written fifties pulp mystery novel with a wicked sense of black humor and a pull the rug out from under you twist ending.  An ending that still manages to surprise even if you know it going in (or, more than likely, have seen either film version of the novel prior to reading it) because Bloch is such a master at hiding the clues inside the narrative.  Regardless of what those 1 and 2 star naysayer grumblers quibble about, Psycho is THE acknowledged high water mark of serial killer stories and a novel no horror/crime fan should overlook or be without.

With the novel Psycho House author Robert Bloch created a trilogy that closed with a typically witty examination of the obsession America has with its serial killer 'heroes'.  Norman Bates has been quite dead for years, the insane killer from the previous novel is safely tucked away in an asylum, and the infamous Bates house and motel is set to become a wax museum that recreates the gruesome details of the crimes committed there.  Too bad a teenaged trespasser has just been stabbed to death on the property.  With all the usual suspects accounted for who can be killing now, and why?  Geared more for fans of the novels than the films, this is recommended to old fashioned Bloch fans.  Those looking for thrills with a harsher edge should look elsewhere.	2001-10-15

This graphic (hehehe) novel is frenetic in its pacing, something sexual is happening on each page, so readers won't be wanting of that kind of material.  Petra is suffering from frustrated sapphic lust when she meets Jennifer, a new student at school (which more resembles a Catholic High School than a college).  When Jennifer finds Petra's graphic diary that details her fantasies of lesbian lust the two quickly find sexual bliss of a sort (I hesitate to call it love).  They also brazenly share it with others, namely a similiarly frustrated nun that teaches at their school.  The artwork is black and white and, I thought, quite good.  However the lack of any real story (the book is a series of vignettes, sliding from dreams, to fantasies, to reality in a smooth yet surreal fashion) or playfulness (with the exception of a two girls spied experimenting in a fenced off backyard) and romantic emotion (do these girls actually feel anything for each other or are they just using each other as tools for sexual release) weakens what little frothy fun can be found and makes it feel slight and hollow.  Having the names of the main characters share that of the artist and author is a cute touch though.  Recommended only for die-hard fans of this sort of thing.	2001-10-11

This collection of five linked stories that try to chart the birth, growth, and death of the sixties hulla-baloo starts off strongly with two great tales.  Low Men in Yellow Coats is not only a parallel chapter in the long running Dark Tower series, one that drops hints and clues about the coming battle to right the incorrect turn the world has made, but it is also a cynical turn on King's earlier coming of age tale The Body.  The second tale, Hearts in Atlantis, is another coming of age story set in college, and is a beautiful yarn of how King's generation woke up, tried to change the world, and then 'blew it', choosing instead to live the good life while striking a pose.  Both tales feature King at his most emotionally powerful but sadly feature weak endings, not surprising considering that each tale is meant to be a part of a larger patchwork narrative.  The remaining three tales, while well written, are poorly focused and come nowhere near the emotional wallop of either Low Men or Hearts in Atlantis.  As the tales converge and close with a blurry whimper instead of a focused bang, the over all vision of the patchwork is lost.  But despite the book's many weaknesses I still feel that the first two remain required reading for King fans.	2001-10-11

Tom Clancy has been on my 'got-to-read-this-writer-someday' list for years now.  Without Remorse had been the book I had chosen as 'most likely to read' for some reason or another, probably because that was the one that had come out when I decided to finally get around to reading him someday, but the relevance to the events of 9/11/2001 made me set aside Without Remorse as an introduction to Clancy and start with Debt of Honor instead.  I'm glad I did.<br />Debt of Honor is a HUGE book packed with tightly woven and extremely detailed plots that could, in a lesser hand, have choked the book to inertia, there is such a thing as too much information Tom.  Certainly the methodical and microscopic detailed set-up may turn some people off, it almost did me in, which is why I give the novel three stars instead of four.  But the pay off in watching the US economy meltdown and the subsequent battle scenes, both on the field and in the boardroom, as well as the sex scandal revolving around the Vice-Presiden, are well worth wading through all the plausibility building info Clancy throws at us.  Fans of this sort of thing will have probably read this already, but I recommend it to those with a ghoulish curiosity about the ending.  If one good thing has come from reading this supersized mega-thriller it's that Executive Orders has now been added to my Clancy Reading List.	2001-10-10

After the disappointing Petals on the Wind I wondered just what story was left to tell about Cathy and Chris and their troubled family.  Not much it seems.<br />This tale revolves around Cathy writing the book that would become 'Flowers in the Attic' while an elderly lady and her sour and sinister butler try to connect with her children, Bart and Jory.  You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out just who the old lady is.<br />The two children (one well adjusted, the other suffering mentally) take turns telling the bitter tale.  While that makes for an uneven narrative it does get the novel closer to the gothic tone of the fractured fairy tale mixed with taboo shattering family secrets in Flowers than the meandering, heavy on the soap suds Petals did.  Close but no cigar.	2001-10-10

Garden of Shadows does quite a good job in both giving us a backstory as to how the Dollenganger saga began and a look into the scarred soul of the woman who would become The Grandmother.  The tale is well told, the author (who is Andrew Neiderman and NOT the late Virgnia Andrews) quite obviously did a lot of detailed research into the timelime of the stories that follow this prequel, making sure that all hints and clues are well explained and/or explored.  Olivia is allowed to tell her side of the sordid tale and, although the motives for her monstrous behavior are well founded, she, in the end, falls short of being a sympathetic anti-heroine and, with the closing of the hidden door to the attic, remains a vile monster.	2001-10-10

It is a breezy look at Hollywood life from a kid that got to live the star dream.

Just when you think it can't get worst for our flawed heroes it does, a whole lost worse.  &quot;Is it even possible to get out of this alive?&quot; worse, in fact.<br />Pure roman noir pulp, yet oddly romantic, Bite starts off running and does not stop for a moment to catch its breath.  Fans of generic vampire stories will no doubt be put off.  Readers beware...Laymon IS NOT Anne Rice, or any other goth type writer that makes the perverse somewhat romantic.<br />And, as is to be expected from Laymon, the human monsters are far, far worse than the inhuman ones.

Joseph Patrick Beauregard turns out not the be the arch-conservative attorney that his flamboyant sister-in-law Maxie Corban, and everyone else in town, thinks he his. Especially since Joe overheard Maxie while she was engaged in some spicy phone sex one night. Joe has avoided her for nine months, but, since they are to be godparents to their married siblings child, they are thrust back together to plan a christening party. He attempts to apologize for is caddish eavesdropping, but his attraction for his sister-in-law's nearly out of control personality gets in the way and his once staid life is forever compromised.<br />Soon enough Joe has called off his engagement to his uptight fiance and is stepping out on one boring date after another trying to find his inner wild side while he and Maxie have heated phone 'conversations' every night before bed.<br />While Maxie inspires Joe to kick it up a bit, Joe is making Maxie yearn to settle it down a little. She and Joe are both a tad envious of the love and family their siblings share.<br />Watching Joe and Maxie dance around each other until they meet halfway makes for a steamy hoot of a tale. It had me giggling and loosening my collar at the same time. This is one hot and funny read, highly recommended.	2001-09-05

Although I liked Elspeth very much I found Alex to be pretty much a selfish creep.  In fact I really didn't care that much for any of the male characters.  Also Alex switches for a revenge seeking creep to an obsessed lover seeking to rekindle the flame he shared with Elspeth in Scotland in little less than a paragraph.  I may read other Tallchief stories if I come across them, but they aren't high on my must read list.  Disappointing.	2001-09-03

Rick Hautala's story of a man returning to Maine with his family to claim an inheritence is tightly plotted and scary, but something seems to be missing. The supernatural events seemed unexplained (perhaps I just didn't 'get it'). While the characters, as usual, are well developed and credible and the novel is definitely frightening, it just isn't one of Hautala's best. Still recommended though.	2001-08-30

When attorney Katherine Wilson is forced to go into hiding she did not expect, nor want, to find love. But she does with Kyle Spencer, the owner of Bonsai Trials (amongst other things) and the man guiding her through the Sierras. The chemistry between the two is potent and the setting and suspense subplot are quite good (it reminded me a bit of the 1980s Sidney Poiter thriller Shoot to Kill). Author Jill Shalvis shows a great deal of promise, she just needs to polish her writing style a bit. Recommended.	2001-08-29

My favorite kind of love story is when two people who have been friends for an extended period find themselves falling in love with each other, or discover that they have been in love all this time and in denial about it. Hawk's Way: The Virgin Groom is just such a tale.<br />Mac Macready met Jewel Whitelaw while attending Camp LittleHawk, a camp for children with cancer and other illnesses, when they were children. An intense friendship was formed that the passage of time, failed relationships with others, and painful injuries (to both body and spirit) has not weakened. When Mac is faced with a career ending injury he returns to the soothing comfort of the Hawk Ranch and his friendship with Jewel. But times and, more importantly, feelings have changed. Though neither Mac or Jewel want to destroy their friendship, both cannot deny the attraction they feel for one another. Things get even more sticky when they discover the feelings are mutual. And there is that painful trauma in Jewel's past that needs help being overcome. A deceptively brisk read that packs a bigger emotional punch than you would expect. Recommended.	2001-08-21

Although I found the ending somewhat rushed and the character of Zac Randolph more interesting than the laconic Tyler, the undeniable chemistry between Tyler and Daisy mixed with the land rights intrigue makes for an unputdownable good read.  The character of Daisy is especially fun to watch and grow. One thing I really liked about her is just how closely she resembled her father in her stubborn behaviour and how author Leigh Greenwood managed not to beat the reader over the head with it, he (yes, Leigh is a MAN) lets you figure it out for yourself through the character's behavior.  I am glad that this is part of a series, because these are characters I would love to spend some more time with. Highly recommended.	2001-08-21

I guess there comes a point in every writer's life where the major themes that run through his or her work have been touched upon.  To some readers who didn't particularly care for a lot of those themes to begin with - as John Irving argued in his book 'A Widow for One Year' - these later works seem mere flaccid retreads, weak reflections of superior books (when the themes were new, hot, and/or unique).  Some writers reach this point early - the before mentioned John Irving seems a good example, as do Peter Straub and Clive Barker - others reach it later.<br />Stephen King has reached this point.<br />Now this may not be a bad thing.  King, in recent years, has shown a tremendous emotional growth as a 'literary' writer while remaining true to his pulp fiction roots, but more and more the tunes sound the same.  Sometimes the mix works (as in Bag of Bones and the short novels Low Men in Yellow Coats and Hearts in Atlantis) sometimes not (The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon).  Dreamcatcher, King's first novel since being struck by a van and almost killed, is in the 'works' category.<br />Some readers may groan that the material is yet another reworking of an oft told tale (Desperation being an excellent example, the two books are practically doppelgangers) and whine about elements reused from It (childhood friends doing battle with monsters), The Tommyknockers (mind and body absorbing space aliens), and the short story Weeds [aka The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill episode in the movie Creepshow].  But it is these very same elements that make Dreamcatcher a King story.  Take some of those elements, make them into labyrinthian literary references and it could be a Straub story, or make them into a breech into some kind of strange fantasy world and it could be a Barker tale.  The story is universal (pun intended) - King was just lucky enough to uncover it first.<br />While in Junior High School four friends do a good thing, perhaps it is even a great thing, and are changed in ways they cannot comprehend.  One in particular, who, as an adult, is nearly killed in a traffic accident, has been changed even further.  This is good, because something very nasty has crashed deep within the woods of northern Maine and, during their annual hunting trip, these friends must confront and defeat this horrific alien lifeform before its flesh eating seed can be planted and given a chance to grow.<br />The novel is long (not uncommon for a King tale), but, considering the scope of the danger, not unjustified and the story is tight.  Personally I do not see where any cuts to shorten it could have been made.  It is also very gruesome.  The flesh eating byrus and the bowel infesting byrum are both shudder inducing.  Believe when I tell you that you will not be able to break wind and NOT think about this book.<br />Whether the story works for you or not depends entirely on how deeply attached you are to themes King plays when weaving a story.

Although the film adaptation is fine (Jodie Foster was perfect for the part) it does not come close to the haunting power of this chilling novel.  Thirteen year old Rynn lives at the end of the lane with her recluse father, or does she?  Mrs. Hallet, her landlord, is getting suspicious of Rynn and her lifestyle just as her child molesting son (who is far older and creepier in the novel than in the film) is begins harrassing the little girl as well.  Complicating matters further is Rynn's growing attraction to the equally curious Sheriff's son Mario.<br />Laird Koenig masterfully weaves these plot threads togehter into an icy spider web that Rynn may or may not get herself free of.  Watching it all come together (and apart) creates one of the truly great cult classic novels of the seventies.  Required reading for psychological thriller fans and those with a taste for gothic imagery.  Highly recommended.	2001-08-01

Lynda Simmons has a gift for bringing even the most sidelined of characters to three dimensional life, which makes her story all the richer.

However this is far from the truth. Meg hasn't sold her other two books and is beginning to think she may be nothing but a one book wonder.<br />While attending her ten year reunion (a bitter fiasco when she discovers the bogus rumors circulating about her) Meg hooks up with Daniel Willett, the shy ranch hand whom she had a secret crush on (and who also inspired a character in her novel). Daniel also has had deep feelings for this talented woman (who he believes is too good for him) and the two share a night of passionate lovemaking made even hotter by the love they are unaware of sharing. Further complicating matters is that neither wants to spoil what they incorrectly assume is a fleeting affair. This is something far stronger and deeper than a one night stand. Watching this to lovebirds do the dance and expose their secrets and feelings was time well spent. I didn't want the book to end! My only quibble was that the subplots were left unresolved, small irritation considering the quality of chemistry between Meg and Daniel.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-07-23

The on going tale of the phony horrors the Lutz family suffered at the hands of a 'demonic force' lacks any feeling of credibility.  It's just one melodramatic 'evil event' after another. The most ludicrous sequence being a moment where Father Mancuso does spiritual battle with a satanist in a San Francisco head shop (a scene that reads like something cribbed from a Graham Masterton novel). Only passing references are made to the creation of the first bestselling book, the hit movie adaptation, and, in the most revealing moment of the novel, aiding Ronald DeFeo's defense attorney with the story of their unfortunate experiences (for which all this nonsense was created in the first place, to give the insanity plea supernatural credence - it failed). Of interest only to those brave souls wanting to examine how low some people will go to exploit tragic events to make money.  Not recommended AT ALL!	2001-07-20

Richard Laymon's sudden passing on Feb. 14, 2001 was a serious blow to horror's literary validity. Anyone who has read more than one of Laymon's books will know that. The Stake is a particularly good one, alternately fall down funny and curl up into a fetal position and cry for momma scary. A horror writer (who seems to be made from a mold quite similiar to Laymon's, judging from the little writer details and scrumptious in-jokes he throws in), his wife, and their neighbors/best friends find a gruesome secret in an old, deserted ghost town. The corpse of a woman with a stake driven through her heart. This is only the first in a long line of frightening and mysterious events that befall our characters, they're far too realistically drawn to be called heroes.<br />As with Laymon's other stories I have read, the human monsters (which include a sadistic rapist and one loony vampire hunter) are far more disgusting and evil than the fantasical creatures that usually inhabit these sorts of tales, this makes the novel far more realistic and disturbing than its contemporaries. As with Laymon's other books I was sorry to see it end, I wanted to hang around the characters some more and see how the events colored the rest of their lives, they were THAT well drawn. Definitely a novel I will be revisiting and one I highly recommend.	2001-06-11

To understand how this strange marriage of true crime reporting and paranormal 'research' came about the reader need look no further than the dedication to William Weber. Weber was/is the defense attorney for Ron DeFeo Jr and the key conspirator of the infamous Amityville Hoax. His greasy fingerprints are all over this book, which continues to try and build a bogus case of paranormal activity driving Ron DeFeo to kill his family. Want real facts about these murders? Go to Amityvillemurders.com, it will truly open your eyes to the deceit of the 'haunting' of the house at 112 Ocean Avenue.<br />The biggest danger sign that I was in for more parapsychology 'fuzzy math' nonsense came in author Holzer's foreward concerning possession. In that essay Holzer gives us two examples of possession, yet concludes with this strange statement...&quot;What I have just mentioned are two classic cases of possession. They are not actual cases, and the names mentioned are ficitious, but I can match these hypothetical cases over and over with real stories from my files.&quot; What? Two classic, yet ficitious, cases? And if these so called classic cases are ficitious then it would go without saying that the names would be ficitious as well, would it not? Also Dr. Holzer if these bogus tales match cases from you files 'over and over' why didn't you site those, especially since you are making the sloppy arguement that DeFeo was driven by paranormal forces to kill his family? Even the excessive amount of court documents you use do nothing to back up your arguements, which are so weakly presented as to be laughable. Also your poor research in the bogus 'history' of the house is even more disappointing. All of the so-called paranormal theories have been disproved over time, but people still want to believe in them, so more exploitative trash like this book will be written and sold and read. So much the sadder for those who have truly suffered from the DeFeo murders, namely the DeFeo family.

The book is full of Herbert's trademark graphic sex and grue as well as some truly awesome apocalyptic mayhem, all which is described in his deliciously clean and crisp prose. While the novel may lack a certain artistic depth it still offers a quick and special effects laden read that satisfies like a cold drink on a hot day. Enjoy.	2001-05-24

The Amityville Horror is the unnerving tale of 28 days spent in a house either haunted or possessed by some sort of evil spirit. What makes the book even more disturbing is its subtitle - A True Story. Whether or not the tale is actually true or a simple hoax to generate attention and cash (not to mention aid in Ron DeFeo's temporary insanity plea - &quot;The house made me do it!&quot;) is still in debate after nearly thirty years. All true/false quibbles aside it must be said that Jay Anson has crafted a fairly decent haunted house yarn...My only quibble is that Anson embraces sensationalism in relating the spooky events. Everything that is the slightest bit unnerving, or perceived as mysterious, is stated with an exclamation point (!) which is the literary equivalent of shouting. Presenting the events in a quieter narrative tone would have, in my opinion, made them more realistic sounding and less like someone trying to convince me it is. Nonetheless the tale is now a legend and the book worthwhile reading, despite all of its narrative shortcomings.	2001-05-24

After taking a two year break from this seemingly endless series of end of the world novels I finally picked it back up where I had left it behind, with Nicolae Carpathia (aka The AnitChrist) deciding to show up at the Meeting of the Witnesses after all.<br />Apollyon, like the others before it, is a quick and frothy read that emphasizes cliffhanger action above any real dramatic tension. Think of it as Irwin Allen's Production of The Book of Revelations. What lifted this entry above a three star rating was the somewhat refreshing humor I found in it. Some of the slapstick moments (at the AntiChrist's or his Supreme Commander's expense) were quite refreshing, although Supreme Evil Incarnate treated as a buffoon does not inspire fear in me. I also have a soft spot in my heart for monster mayhem and the swarm of locust like demons at the novel's conclusion satisfied that B-movie craving quite nicely. After the disappointing Soul Harvest this was a breath of fresh air and it left me hungry for the next book in the series, which is just what Jenkins wants to inspire in his devoted readership. I enjoyed it but, seeing that it suffers from the same problems (no real dramatic tension, endless repetition of cliffhangers, Hero Death Exemption) and only moves the story forward by inches, I cannot really recommend it, but, from a personal entertainment standpoint, I give it four stars for the guilty pleasure of it all.	2001-05-23

The saddest thing about The Traveling Vampire Show is that Richard Laymon's sudden death has robbed us all of the emotionally rich direction his writing was obviously going. Now for the book...<br />A carnival show of sorts arrives in a small (southern?) town and promises a blood soaked show at a local field (one with a particularly gruesome past). A trio of curious teens decide to sneak a look, to see if TTVS is all that it promises to be.  And so begins a day of cat and mouse, mysterious disappearances, and disturbing revelations about not only the Vampire Show but themselves as well. Laymon continually reminds us all that the human monster is far, far worse than any of the cotton candy nightmares we gobble up in books or stare at on the drive-in movie screen.<br />Certainly Laymon's approach ... which is rooted in the pulp literary tradition (dig the nude catfight that climaxes the story)... but I feel this strengthens the novel's unique character. It also works best in its small moments of isolated creepiness and in the melacholic sexual tensions between Dwight and his female friend Slim. Laymon can certainly be found guilty of going over the top on more than one occassion, but he must be given serious literary points for having his narrator share the reader's obivous incredulity, and disgust, at how some of the day's events turn out for Dwight and his friends. My only complaint is that the book seemed to end too soon. I had fallen in love with the characters and wanted to spend some more time with them. Perhaps it is a tale Laymon did not get the chance to tell. Pity.	2001-05-20

It was the wisest choice he could have made. Although stomach churningly graphic a moments there are many others that let you feel the spiritual nature of the ordeal these young men faced for seventy-two days in the Andes. In its documentary fashion the book perfectly communicates the &quot;Christmas Miracle&quot; that is the story of the Andes Survivors. Highly recommended.	2001-05-12

Williamson was a whirling dervish of literary out put in the late seventies and early eighties. With this thriller, another in a non connected series featuring a Basil Rathbone look alike parapsychology teacher, a young boy with telekinetic powers and multiple evil personalities may grow up to be the Anti-Christ itself! Talk about your plots!<br />The one scene that stands out the most in my memory is the dinner table assault scene. The boy feeds off his mother's irritation at how her husband always pronounces ketchup as &quot;cats-up&quot;, next thing you know the condiment bottle is levitating and chasing the terrified dad around the dinner table. Pretty wild stuff that.  Not exactly horrifying, but it isn't boring either.  Recommended.	2001-05-11

Williamson was churning out books by the dozen, new books would appear on the shelves in mere days.  Perhaps that is why so much of his work has a crazy kinetic energy to it.  The Tulpa has enough goofy energy for two or three novels.<br />An eldery man begins to develop psychic powers (he has visions of approaching disasters) even as his mind slowly rots away from alzheimers.  His son-in-law investigates that phenomona and encourages the old man to try and create a stronger grip on those powers since they save lives.  The old man's concentration leads to the creation of a Tulpa (a psychically controlled semi-sentient force that is projected from the body, or something like that).  The Tulpa and its rampage does not appear until the closing pages of the novel, Williamson choosing to focus the story on the ESP investigating of the son-in-law and his daring rescues of those in his father-in-law's visions.  Exciting fluff.	2001-05-02

Whitley Strieber, after writing two non-fiction accounts of his experiences with apparent non-human intelligence, returned to the fiction arena with this rather uninspired novel about the infamous Roswell incident.

David Lippincott's Unholy Mourning is one of those near miss novels, with a little trimming and a few sloppy plot points ironed out it would have been a first rate suspense thriller.  As is it's just a two and a half star potboiler.<br />Poor Jorby has been driven mad by his guilt for the drowning death of his identical twin brother.  When not romancing the town's old maid in training he's sitting and talking to a rock, his way of communicating with his dead brother.  Through a convoluted set of circumstances he manages to get his hands on a cataleptic inducing drug (one not unlike that used in The Serpent and the Rainbow) that he uses on his neighbors and enemies to bury them alive.  He also tape records the poor victims struggles to torment the remaining townspeople.  Sadly Lippincott, while creating interesting characters, cannot weave all the plot elements together into a believable package, which robs the novel of a great deal of its impact.  Despite its weakness the die hard horror buffs will be rewarded with an autopsy scene they won't soon forget.	2001-04-30

For those who do not believe that horror icon Romero is an artist passionate about his work I submit this book as a testament that he in fact is. Although hopelessly out of date by now (it ends with a mention of Monkeyshines being his next movie) it still remains a vibrant look at the independant spirit that brings all of Romero's work life. Required reading for Romero fans (both fair weather and die hard). Highly recommended.	2001-04-26

When I saw the novelization for Jaws: The Revenge at the local book shop I was happy, there hadn't been one since Hank Searls's fine novel version of Jaws 2. However after seeing the horrid movie I was uncertain of actually bothering to waste valuable time reading the book based on the movie's ludicrous script. Onlly the fact Searls, a fine novelist, had come back to write another Jaws novelization made me rethink my junking of the book. In the end it was a decision well made.<br />Searls, being an intelligent writer, makes a sincere and commenable effort to, once again, create more than just a movie script in the book form. He takes us inside the heads of the characters and creates motives for their actions. He even creates a plausible (albeit supernatural) reason for the shark to only want to attack members of the Brody family. In an interesting twist Searls uses segments from his novel version of Jaws 2 for Ellen Brody's memories of Sean's childhood at his funeral, in the film they were scenes for the original Jaws (events of Jaws 2 are never mention and references to the shark are singular, apparently the two preceeding sequels never happened). I recommend reading this book as an original novel and skipping the movie, unless you like subjecting yourself to pathetic Hollywood misfires.	2001-04-26

The Desires of Rebecca is the tale told by a young runaway who, because of her sexual orientation, finds herself in numerous sexual adventures, few of which end happily. The story begins with a little lovemaking session between Rebecca and her childhood friend after a nude swim in a cool river. The father of Rebecca's lover arrives and is disgusted and aroused by finding his daughter passionately making love with her closest female friend. Fearing punishment (it's not that kind of story) and a forced marriage to 'cure' her, Rebecca runs off (buck naked of course) to begin a new life. Our heroine quickly finds brief happiness with a lovely (and quite timidly curious) gypsy girl and her family (this is my favorite part of the book), but her fear of once again being caught in the act of 'perverse' love making forces Rebecca to flee onto the streets of 18th century London. There she falls under the wing of a seemingly kindly madam and from there into the arms of a pirate captain which leads to... As you can see the novel's story unfolds like sapphic Perils of Pauline. There is plenty of hot sex (apparently geared towards the guys) but the steam runs dry after Rebecca becomes a pirate, after that the book seems to run out of ideas as things become very rushed and perfunctory. Nonetheless I recommend it heartily just for the heat the cute gypsy girl radiates when her inhibitions are slowly (and I mean slowly, the author really lingers on the frustrated and playful desires) stripped away until she confidently seduces Rebecca. Good stuff, unrealistic as hell, but good.	2001-04-25

The title of this books should have been Warbeasts since that is the name of the menacing monsters in this fairly pedestrian end of the world thriller.<br />The story starts with a satellite containing Warbeast eggs crashing to earth and unleashing an endless cloud of death.  Many die, few survive.  Author T. W. Stetson keeps things moving more or less, but is guilty of a writing crime.  Spelling out sound effects.  Every other paragraph the reader is treated to Blam! or Bang! or Scraaatch! and the dreaded Warbeast Hssss!  It grows tiresome after awhile and sinks the novel down to the level of a comic book (which can be a good thing at times, but this isn't one of those times).  Also whole pages are spent introducing complex character relations only to have those same characters killed (it's like a James Herbert Rat novel gone wrong).  The book is fun, but not at all frightening and the non stop action grows tiresome, the urge to skim over all the needless exposition to get to the end stronger with each passing chapter.  Not recommended to any but the most die hard of monster fans.	2001-04-23

Gerald Astor has done an excellent job recounting Joseph Menegele's life both before and after the Nazi regime. He paints a pretty depressing picture of a man with no remorse for his crimes against humanity while hiding from a world that hates him, and rightfully so, and the family that protected him. He also shows the greater impact that the personification of Menegele as Evil Incarnate had on the world and media. However the psychological motives for Menegele the man's actions during the Nazi regime remain a mystery. Perhaps this kind of evil always will.	2001-04-20

And I never knew that the forces of evil were so incredibly well endowed. You aren't fooling me one bit Mr. Johnstone.

A big (and I do mean BIG) shark goes up river and begins feeding on swimmers and fishers in Biloxi, Mississippi. The book is as silly as it sounds.<br />I will give Mr. Wilson the benefit of his obvious hard wark in researching how something like this could possibly happen, but sadly he does not manage to make his story easy to swallow, nor does he make it very suspenseful. Attacks happen, people either narrowly escape or are swallowed whole. It is hard to care either way. Also there is a twist, but anyone who has had a steady diet of this kind of material will see it coming from a hundred pages away. Reading this it is far too easy to see why NBC scuttled the mini-series. There really isn't enough material for a good saturday night movie!	2001-04-19

Quite a bit really, but Williamson writes pulpish novels for entertainment and Premonition is certainly not boring. This is part of a series of novels regarding a parapsychology teacher (I cannot remember his name, but I do know he looks just like Basil Rathbone) who, like reporter Carl Kolchak, always managed to get embroiled in some strange, paranormal events. Other books featuring him are Williamson's The Ritual and Brotherkind. None of the events in each of the different novels are mentioned outside of the book in which they happen, each can stand alone.<br />In this novel we have him head off to an island to try a new lifestyle in which people live in exact harmony with their astrology signs. Things go well for awhile, people have some truly wild sex with each other (as long as their signs match up for combatibilty) and the mental energy is off the scale.<br />Then people begin to die.<br />There is also some strange scientist guy who is doing medical research that Tampers in God's Domain. Everything comes together at the end, but does it add up? [NO], but as I said at the beginning of my little review, Williamson only aims to entertain and that this just what he does with this book.

Benchley seemed to be slumming it. After rehashing Jaws into a superior (and terrifying) book he turns around and mixes the Creature from the Black Lagoon, Piranha, and Jaws into an entertaining but creatively bankrupt novel. If this had not been from the author of Jaws and Beast I would give it three or four stars, but I have to dock it on the principal that both the reader and the author know the story could be a lot more than it is. This book marks a conclusion of sorts to a Sea Monster Trilogy (Jaws and Beast being the first two in the series) and is the weakest of them all. It is clearly time for Benchley to move onto other subjects.	2001-04-16

The nearly mythical giant squid, now starving from over population, a situation caused in part by man's hunting the squid's predators to near extinction, rises to the surface and begins to hunt man just off the coast of the Bermuda islands.  Benchley keeps the plot moving so fast that you can forgive him for simply rewriting Jaws as a better novel (Benchley even throws in a joke or two about his previous sea creature chiller).

After the disastrous events in 'Episode' 3: Winter Knight the now unemployed Ethan Proctor is forced into taking a vacation by his miserable coworkers. Sadly something very strange and nasty is waiting for him in Atlantic City. Is this serial killer simply a cannibalistic Jack the Ripper, or is he something else, something worse?<br />Grant's series really hits a comfortable stride in this outting.  The story is rock solid and the characters fit together nicely and work as a real team, not just people working at the same job. Hunting Ground can also stand alone, the missing girl story arc is set aside (but not forgotten in the least) in favor of explorig the Dark Forces conspiracy and that makes the book even that more refreshing. There are more than a few subtle hints and clues that nastier things are in store for both Ethan and his Black Oak company.  I also hope that Grant brings back one particular character for a second go around (you'll know who I mean after reading the book, no spoilers here). Highly recommended.	2001-04-16

I have read somewhere that Huggins is/was a screenwriter which explains why so much information is delivered in highly unrealistic and stilted 'speeches' rather than built into creating three dimensional characters. I'm no scientist, but it looks as if Huggins did at least some homework and his explanation as to how a fire breathing dragon might be able to actually exist seemed plausible (not that that matters too much to monster fans, we'll take any explanation as long as we have groovy monsters running around wreaking havoc), for that I give it three stars.

My big quibble with Soul Harvest was just how closely it followed the event outline of Nicolae. Buck saves Chloe from harm, then runs off to save someone else. Meanwhile Rayford continues to spy on Nicolae and seek out the newly saved. The intrigue heats up and the nastier bits of the tribulation are yet to come, but did Jenkins have to gloss over plagues in mere paragraphs? And just how long is he going to drag these events out? Questions I would not be asking if he spent more time developing three dimensional and complex characters to inhabit this hellish world. I wasn't exactly bored with the novel, but I was far from impressed. I'll get around to reading part 5 someday, but I'm rapidly loosing interest in this seemingly endless series since it obviously has nothing for its characters to do.	2001-04-15

Beginning with a global thermonuclear war and ending with a massive earthquake, Jerry Jenkins third book in his Left Behind series continues a downward spiral of emphasizing action over character. Other quibbles are how unscathed just about everything seems to be after the war. I know that the Anti-Christ is supposed to appear as quite the miracle worker and all, but come on.  A little greater attention to detail would be nice. The book is breathlessly paced and full of action and intrigue, but without a heavy dramatic anchor to hold the story for us it is hard to care too deeply about the characters and the upcoming perils they will face. As with Left Behind and Tribulation Force, Jenkins' ends this novel with a cliffhanger that will have hooked readers (of which I am one) anxiously awaiting the next volume, others may feel cheated.	2001-04-15

I will not for a moment pretend that I am any kind of a theological expert and will leave whatever flaws Jerry Jenkins's Left Behind series has in that department to others. For the record 'co-writer' LaHaye contributes an event timeline for Jenkins to build a story around, nothing more.  The story?  Just as airline pilot Rayford Steele decides to begin cheating on his suddenly fundamentalist and rapture obsessed wife several people disappear from his plane. Steele, being the lead character, immediately realizes that The Rapture has happened and he has been LEFT BEHIND.  Yeah, the book (in fact the entire series) is that melodramatic and unsubtle. Readers expecting a serious examination of what might happen in the world if the prophecy of the end time events in The Bible did come to pass in our contemporary times should look elsewhere. This series of books is nothing more than Christian prophecy reinvented as the pulp novel cliffhanger equivalent to all those Indiana Jones movies. I give it four stars because, despite weaknesses discussed by others, the book nonetheless entertained me and maintained my interest. Recommended for those who just can't get enough of end time stories.	2001-04-15

Left Behind 2: Tribulation Force is a mixed bag of poorly plotted action and sweet romance.  While author Jerry B. Jenkins still has more than enough end of the world action to fill his books, this entry is more than a tad clumsy, offering more seemingly needless stage setting and a love story rather than some of the threatened plagues, wars, earthquakes and such that are supposed to befall humanity in the coming books/years.  While I'll admit with zero embarrassment as to enjoying the old fashioned love story plot (romances can be fun) I could not help but feel that Jenkins was running out of things for his characters to do.  This becomes even more apparent when he simply skips over an extended period of time to get to a 'good part' rather than work the storyline events into the tale itself.  Jenkins stumbles badly when, after the leap, he brings in a supporting character completely out of left field and spends only one or two paragraphs introducing her before marrying her off to Rayford.  The eruption of WWIII and the death of a semi-major character are similarly rushed. That is just plain lazy and sloppy writing.  But clumsy writing aside, the sweet romance between Buck and Chloe (Rayford's daughter) was enough of a joy to read that I'll give the book four stars anyway. But beyond this entry the future for this series of books is looking even grimmer than what is in store for the characters.	2001-04-15

Steve Alten's novel Meg reads more like the novelization of a Summer Event Picture that, in the wake the American Godzilla debacle, just didn't get around to happening.

His tales move so fast that it is almost too easy to skip over the important plot details, which I guess happened to a few of the negative reviewers here. All the plot holes seemed to be filled to me. The reason for the rain is made abundantly clear and the overcoming of the psychosis (which simply entails washing the black fluid off of the victim) happens to more than just one character in the book and certain character's awareness of, and ability to fight off, the rain's seduction to violence seems to depend more on the character rather than the situation.<br />All in all One Rainy Night is a brisk, blood curdling b-movie of a read, the literary mirror of George Romero's The Crazies (aka Code Name: Trixie). This was the first Richard Laymon novel I have read and will certainly will not be the last. I have become a fan for life.	2001-04-14

You can forget the bogus Maui setting for this book, it's simply a backdrop decoration. This &quot;speculative fiction&quot; story is set firmly in John Saul Techno-Thriller Territory, so it can really take place anywhere. Anyone who has read a Saul novel knows this tale too well - some Meglomanical Corporation has taken over a small town so it may conduct unethical medical experiments on the children and teenagers. Been there and done that in The God Project, Darkness, Shadows, Sleepwalk, Creature, and on and on. But one reads John Saul for dependable fun, not for surprises, and The Presence does have its moments of gruesome fun. It did not stun me, nor did it bore me, it just kept me suitably entertained until the end, which is about all I expect from John Saul.	2001-04-10

Despite all the snazzy set dressing he can come up with in terms of story concept, horror writer John Saul writes with such a consistent tone and stock characters that it makes his novels both dependable and predictable reading.<br />The Right Hand of Evil is yet another tale of a miserable family moving into a quaint, isolated, and very small town with a dark, nasty secret to hide (invariably relatives of the newcomers are smack in the middle of it all). Slowly the horrors of the past rise up and engulf our hapless protagonists. The only difference from Saul's other supernatural based horror chillers is that animals, and not children, get the brunt of the torture, so animal lovers beware.<br />As a quick, gruesome read The Right Hand of Evil has enough spooky moments to make it a suitable diversion for a lazy summer afternoon in the hammock, or a rainy winter night in front of the fire. Recommended to his fans.	2001-04-10

There is no doubt that Ed Gorman is a very talented writer, and two or three of the stories in this anthology show his strengths quite well.  But the majority of them are simply made up of tired and shop worn noir nightmare cliches. I found myself skimming over whole paragraphs just to make it through all the morose atmosphere to the 'twist' ending I had figured out as soon as the story began. If you must read this then these are the stories I would recommend - Yesterday's Dreams, Different Kinds of Dead, and The Face. The rest you have probably read before in some form or another by other writers.	2001-04-08

When it came to soul chilling tales of Dark Fantasy August Derleth could not come anywhere close to H.P. Lovecraft, the writer Derleth saved from vanishing into pulp literary history. But Derleth's love for the stories and mythos that Lovecraft created in his short life clearly shows in this collection of overly similiar short stories (they all tell the tale of someone moving into an old, isolated house and coming under the influence of the Elder Gods) and it is this love that makes the book a delight to read. It will satisfy the itch for Lovecraft inspired fiction but won't leave a lasting impression. Recommended for die hards only.	2001-04-05

Take Night of the Living Dead (both original and remake), Dawn of the Dead, and Day of the Dead and blend completely with Mad Max, The Road Warrior, and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.  Sprinkle with The Birds (both short story and film versions) and The Day of the Triffids (novel and film versions as well).  Serve well chilled for maximum effect.<br />None of the above comparison are meant to cast a poor light upon Simon Clark's fine novel, far from it.  They are just made to communicate the truly epic scope of the story the novel tells.  Blood Crazy is a completely realized, and original, vision of the end of the world that is as terrifying as it is impossible to put down.  It will leave you breathless, optimistic, and pondering our own future.  In fact the book reads as if it were the opening chapter in a trilogy of its own.  Highly recommended.	2001-04-02

I grew up both reading and loving Ramsey Campbell's dark hearted horror stories, and still do (Nazareth Hill is one of the all time great haunted house stories), but this suspense novel proved too much for me.  A serial killer of children buries his victims in the houses he renovates for customers.  The sympathetic main characters, who are unfortunate enough to own and still live in a property Woolie (the aforementioned killer) used to hide his latest victim, are beseiged by the usual hypocrites, know-it-alls, and inhumanly cruel villans one finds populating Campbell's books.  As usual Campbell he makes the reader empathize with their suffering completely.  But, as I said earlier, the book proved far too disturbing and discomforting for me.  I just had to close it, get some fresh air, and read something else.  A dip into darkness too many for me.	2001-04-02

My apologies to the author, but this book simply did not work for me. I felt no real chemistry between the 'hero' and heroine, just a lot of convoluted history. The 'hero' is especially weak, he may be traumatized by his beloved child's death, but he never does anything to prove or earn the love and respect of the true love he so callously jilted (over hurt feelings) - his whole reason for being there seems rather selfish and his regret at past mistakes rings false. What makes things even worse is when the heroine finds out all about it in a really long sob letter he has written to her, but kept in his desk. The guy was just too weak to care about. The heroine was a little better, but not by much as she was very weak as well. This one is a definite pass.	2001-03-28

I enjoyed the first half of this premiere novel in the Landry Saga far more the second half. All the gothic touches chill the reader in all the right places (I especially enjoyed the voodoo trappings), but the Cajun characters of Ruby's home were far more interesting than the spoiled rich brats in the New Orleans section of the story; and the tortures that Ruby endures at the hands of Gisselle and her cronies are so cruel and inhumane it makes the book difficult to enjoy. Nonetheless, there is more than enough mystery and intrigue in this family's story to make me want to immediately jump into the next book in the series the moment I finish this one.	2001-03-07

Although I do have to question why someone would put up with the abuse that Bart dishes out, I mean come on.<br />However, when I reached the end I had to scream with frustration and rage. Clearly the author (Andrew Neiderman and NOT the late V.C. Andrews) had reached some sort of deadline and had to wrap the book and fast. All the plotlines are tied up so quickly that it was insulting! I wanted a stronger sense of closure, especially after all the suffering these characters had gone through.

An engaged couple spends a terror filled week at the ski resort of Owlsfane, Vermont.  Author &quot;Duffy Stein&quot; (a pseudonym for Mel Burger) keeps the pace slower than the gradual shifting of the earth's plates, allowing for lots of atmosphere and character development, but it drains the fear factor as characters begin behaving stupidly to simply inch the story forward one notch after another.  And an Audrey Rose inspired town hall meeting sequence setting up the climax is simply jaw dropping in its sheer ludicrousness.  At a bulky 474 pages, this novel needs a hefty 100 page trimming.  Not a classic, and not exactly boring, it's just disappointing.	2001-01-07

Once again a troubled family moves to a small town caught in some kind of  time warp (all small towns in John Saul-land are like something out of  Pleasantville) that is equally troubled by some hideous secret that terrify  the elderly, confound the middle aged, and are humorously dismissed by the  local teen-agers (at least in front of their friends).  Soon all hell  breaks loose and people (most often teen-agers and children) begin dropping  like flies.  Saul has told this same story since 1977 and, more often than  not, it works quite well.<br />Just not this time.<br />The Right Hand of Evil  starts off promisingly, with a well drawn look at a marriage  disintergrating under the burden of alcoholism.  But then Saul begins his  standard histronics.  Not particularly frightening, but some scenes do pack  a punch.  I would recommend this for diehard Saul fans only.  Those looking  for better books from this author should try Creature or The Homing.	2000-09-09

I loved the premise that a Godzilla like creature could exist, but the matieral was so ineptly handled that I grew more and more depressed.

Mr. Smith certainly has the talent to create many a blood chilling moment (and many are peppered throughout this somewhat over long book), but the characters act in stupid and/or uneven ways for the sake of advancing the plot. Bad sign that - it means the writer did not fully grasp his characters or his story. Better luck with your next book Mr. Smith.	2000-06-02

Whitley Strieber describes video tape images, shares the abduction stories of others, and makes a plea that the events he and others have either witnessed or experienced be taken seriously.  No one who reads this book will believe after finishing it if they are skeptical of the phenomenon, but those who believe might appreciate it.  Mr. Strieber himself has been inconclusive about just what has happened to him (he never comes out and says they are aliens or spirits, just visitors from an unknown country) and he keeps his fence straddling outlook this time out as well, but constantly reading \\"well this 'could' be a hoax, but if it IS real...\\" weakens the force of his arguments more than skeptical debunking ever could.  Of passable interest to UFO buffs only.	2000-06-02

Lovecraft's classic mythos stories. Some strange creature zaps people with a hypnotic light and takes over their bodies, turning them into shape shifting things. The handful of survivors try to escape a world that is being rapidly invaded and changed. Action packed and fun on its own terms, nonetheless the novel suffers from a certain lack of depth.	2000-06-02

Well abductee/fantasy writer Whitley Strieber explores the possibilities of becoming at one with nature in The Wild, which is one of his strongest pieces of writing and, when coupled with The Wolfen and Wolf of Shadows, forms a trilogy of sorts that examines humankind's place in nature and the need to reconcile and live within it.  A man on the verge of loosing everything finds himself changing into a wolf.  Not quite animal and no longer human, he tries to find his way.  But his family wants him back, so the hunt is on. The characters here are more three dimensional than usual for Strieber's recent attempts at fiction and the message comes through loud and clear with little or no preachiness.  Highly recommended.	2000-06-02

Flush with the success of the briliant Dangeraus Visions, Harlan Ellison and his publishers leapt into the creation of a mulit-volume sequel.  They should have quit while they were ahead.  Most of the stories are good, but  they have not dated well.  Also the book runs needlessly long, with  Ellison's hyper ego prattling on in the introductions and needless double  header works by the writers.  It took me a year to read it all and, for  someone who goes through 3 to 5 books a month, that is NOT praise.	2000-05-30

My wife is scared to death of bees, and after reading this book I think I would be too! John Saul combines his standard 'techno' horror plot (misunderstood teens turned to killer mutants by mad scientist) with a good old fashioned 9i.e. 'cliched') serial killer subplot and creates his most 'original', and quite possibly best, book ever! A real hair (and hell) raiser that will have you squirming to the edge of your seat until the chilling finale. Sure it may be clunky and unsubtle at times, but that is part of Saul's addicting storytelling charm. Recommended.	2000-05-24

The legendary Robert Bloch penned this adaptation of the four story segments in Twilight Zone: The Movie.  The opening and closing bookends are absent though, so it reads more like an anthology of longish short stories than a single narrative. As far as novelizations go this is pretty average stuff.  The usual differences between film and novelization are skimpy, the order of the stories is not the same and some of the events in the notorious John Landis episode offer a glimpse at what may have been attempted had Vic Morrow not died during filming.  Outside of a few of his trademarked word play zingers Bloch can do little to liven up the below average material he has to work with.  So what was the point? I mean this is ROBERT BLOCH, author of Psycho and countless classic stories.  Why waste time with this project?  It had to have been the money.  Bloch addicts may want this only for a complete library of the master's work, others should just stay with the mediocre movie.  Can't recommend it.	2000-05-14

Sometime between going from a magazine writer to a schlock B-movie maker himself, writer/director Jim Wynorski put together this collection of short stories that served as the basis for numerous classic and cult classic  movies.  For any B-movie buff this book is required reading just to see how  close (or far) the adaptations kept to the source stories.  Especially  noteworthy is John Campbell's Who Goes There, it will give you an added  appreciation to John Carpenter 1982 film version of the tale.  Great stuff.  Find it, buy it, read it.	2000-05-13

It is the tale of shipwreck survivors being &quot;rescued&quot; by what turns out to be ghost ship of  The Flying Dutchman type.

There is no hiding behind the supernatural or icky make believe monsters to be found here. The villian of this story rapes and kills little boys and Hautala does not spare the horrifying details.

This 1984 novel poses an original idea for who the killer may have been and why the crimes were committed.  Bloch's voluminous knowledge not only of the crimes themselves but of the Victorian Era makes the novel worthy of repeated readings. A very good book from a great writer.

A little boy sees his mother killed by 'little brothers' that live in underground tunnels that criss cross his hometown. Now the monsters want him as well.

Cronenberg's mind bending thriller is  explored in great depth, better explaining the characters and their  motivations.

Who was Curtis Richards and just how did this individual know so much about Carpenter and Hill's interest with Celtic myth. Not only are all the characters expanded nicely (we get to see Loomis and Michael interacting in the asylum and the good Doctor's growing understanding that the boy harbors pure evil) but an extended historical back story is revealed as well.  The basic storyline of Carpenter's legendary thriller is made so much stronger by these touches. A near classic of its kind.	2000-05-12

Most film novelizations are simply the script put into narrative form and offer little of interest outside of a few scenes either cut from the movie or presented in a slightly different context. Dennis Etchison avoided that trap and created a fully realized adaptation of John Carpenter's The Fog. While the trouble plagued movie had its weak points, it is quite obvious Etchison worked hard to fix them, developing much needed back story and expansion of Carpenter's concepts and multiple plots. The result is a wonderful companion piece to the film that enriches the viewing experience after reading, much like Orson Scott Card's work on The Abyss. Recommended for both Carpenter fans and ghost story addicts.	2000-05-12

Unlike his more pedestrian work on the Halloween II novelization, Etchison, as he did with The Fog, expands upon the narrative, digs deeper in the main character's personal problems (his drinking and failed marriage) and attempts to fix some of the film's countless story problems (i.e. with time zones, conspiracy etc).  He piles on the creepy, shadow drenched atmosphere as well.  The novelization also contains a few in-joke references to The Fog as well as the unrelated Halloween films.  Carpenter and Etchison fans will find plenty to like in this overlooked oddity.  Recommended.	2000-05-12

When hyping this book on the Sci-Fi channel author Robert Bloch quipped &quot;People will be surprised to find that I have done absolutely nothing of merit with my life.&quot; Ha-ha. The man wrote Psycho, the novel that inspired the movie made by whatshisname. But there is also a bitter truth in that statement, Bloch lived the real working writer's life. The one where he didn't get to go to a great many foreign lands, didn't win national acclaim or even fame (despite the success of Psycho), but worked hard, and mostly broke, at his craft for decades. Both the man and his writings really are overlooked national treasures, both to those who simply read him or those lucky enough to have known him. I miss you Mr. Bloch, you had a great life filled with merit.  Highly recommended to those interested in a real working writer's life.	2000-05-11

This collection of pulp tales brilliantly shows just how different the meaning of a writer's work can differ between a fan and the writer. Editor John Stanley, host of the once popular San Francisco based late night horror movie television show Creature Features, put together many of Robert Bloch's 'famous' Lefty Feep stories. Each yarn involved a very contemporary (for the 1940's that is) con man named Lefty Feep who delighted in telling some long suffering schmuck in a coffee shop the wild tales about his failed get rich quick schemes.  Written for the fantasy pulps of yore, each tale has a magical trapping of sorts (i.e. flying carpets, genie in a bottle, etc) that inevitably trip up our tireless, and quite clueless, fall guy of a hero. Not surprisingly Bloch barely remembered writing some of the stories (most were written at the request of the publisher and not out of any desire by Bloch to explore the character further) and this workmanlike attitude casts a humorous light on Stanley's obvious, and quite fanatical, love for the character in the interview segments with Bloch that bookend each story. The small press edition, from Stanley's own, and now defunct, Creatures at Large Press, was intended to be the first volume in a series, but none ever followed. Bloch, in his unauthorized autobiography, blamed the stories with his trademarked bemused self-deprecation.  Highly recommended for both the silly stories and the probably unintended fan/writer insight.	2000-05-11

A local pastor and a newly arrived, and troubled, newspaper editor slowly become aware of some evil forces working to take over a small college town. On another plain angels and demons wage a vicious and graphic battle for the souls of those involved. Filled with quite a bit of suspense and a conservative message that, thankfully, is not so heavy handed that it hampers the story. Recommended.	2000-05-11

So I  thought, after reading Left Behind and a few of its sequels, I would read a  little more about it.  Mr. Lindsey's literal readings of the prophecies are  interesting at first, but soon become rather silly as he tries to explain  the unexplainable.

Balun's defunct Deep Red magazine furnished the writings collected here. If you have an interest in horror's grotesque dark side (yes it can get a lot worse than you could ever imagine) then this book is worth seeking out. There are some truly great bits, notably The Third World Cannibal Films and I Spit in Your Face: Films that Bite (and that means they have teeth, they don't stink).

The excessively shallow and self-absorbed, not to mention annoyingly navel gazing, character never deepens beyond two dimensions.  The reasons for her self destructive behavior don't make an iota of sense, considering she is nothing more than a spoiled suburban brat torturing her mother for having the nerve to raise her in a broken home.  This novel does for the &quot;bad girl&quot; what American Psycho did for serial killers, namely it makes them BORING!  Bad book.  Bad, bad, bad.  Not recommended at all.<br />Also I have lived almost my entire life in the San Francisco Bay Area and I have to say that THERE IS NO MARKET STREET BART STATION! The BART line runs under Market Street and stops at Embarcadero, Montgomery, Powell and, finally, Civic Center. If in fact Jesse were going to The Lusty Lady on Kearny Street she would more than likely get off at Montgomery and have to make a bit of a hike up to the Montgomery/Kearny intersection. When setting the stories at real life locations it is important to get least some of the geographical facts right.  Then again the author did not even bother to get any of the psychological facts right either.  Avoid, avoid, avoid.	2000-05-11

While sporting Grant's keen eye for atmosphere and undstanding of character, the tale just did not come together for me.  A disappointment.	2000-05-10

The children are rescued and then raised by a widowed doctor and his housekeeper. Hopes for a &quot;normal&quot; life outside of the attic appear hopeless as the hyperactive melodramatics and Catherine's heaving bosom narration drag on and on. The plasma parched girl is thristing for revenge but takes forever and a day to get around to it (this book would have been a short novel if she had done it sooner). What made the first book so good was its timelessness, the aura of a fairy tale gone horribly bad. In this book the characters move about a very real and time placed world and this weakens the book. While it may have its moments, they are so few and far between they don't merit looking for, and abuse is not a sign of true love. Soap opera fans might want to give it a look, others should skip it.	2000-05-06

When I was in High School just about every one of my female classmates read FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC and its sequels. Recently I took the plunge and found out why, it's a great read! With its young, sexually and emotionally frustrated teen heroine held captive by a selfish, emotionally childish and manipulative mother and a stern, hateful grandmother, it is easy to see why this novel resonates so powerfully with female teen readers. The horrorific themes of abuse (both phsycial and mental) and incest are handled well and the book packs a surprising emotional wallop. The writing is very uneven and immature, but whether this is a stylistic choice or simply the author's own bad writing is hard to tell. Just be forewarned, the reader may want to have the sequel Petals on the Wind close at hand.  Flowers in the Attic ends on a cliffhanger and you might want to read the next volume ASAP.	2000-04-30

The amount and diversity of the crictical opinions expressed in this book should give it at least 4 stars. Sadly two essayists works contain errors so blatantly ignorant of the source material I had to dock the whole barrel a single star. Carol J. Clover goes into incredible, albeit wincingly inaccurate, detail when describing the stabbing deaths of two characters in a hot tob in the film Halloween 2. However neither of these characters were stabbed in the actual scene, one was strangled and the other scalded. In another example, editor Barry K. Grant, in his essay on legendary horror auteur George A. Romero, continually confuses Dawn of the Dead with Day of the Dead and vice versa. One would think that after supposedly studying these films so closely the writers would get the titles and scenes correct in the texts. Error quibbles aside THE DREAD OF DIFFERENCE is a fascinating and mostly positive study of a genre that has been critically maligned (if not out and out ignored) for far too long.	2000-04-26

There are also references to other classic SF flicks, notably John Carpenter's superlative version of The Thing, and H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulthu Mythos stories. Sadly the humans eclipse some of the monster action, so this feels kind of slow mving. Kaiju classic creatures Megalon and Hedorah (aka The Smog Monster) feel tacked on rather than integral parts of the main plot.

This book is this movie all the G-fans really wanted the team of Emmerich and Devlin to deliver. Chock full of monsters and mayhem, a properly somber tone (the monsters actually kill and eat people) and, most importantly, a serious repect and deep love for the subject matter, Godzilla 2000 is the perfect read for any Godzilla fan of any age.  An essential G-book.	2000-03-25
