Hawken's Heart, originally entitled \\"It came upon a Midnight Clear\\", is a heartfelt romance between Navy SEAL Billy \\"Crash\\" Hawkens and his cousin's personal assistant Nell Burns. Brockman sculpts the secondary romance between Admiral Jake Robinson and Daisy Owens with tenderness and pumps up the adrenaline when Crash is being framed for the assassination of Robinson. The chemistry between the feisty Nell and the brooding Crash is masterfully done. With some climactic surprises and a heart-rendering finale, Hawken's heart aims straight for the heart and establishes itself as one of Brockman's best.	2005-06-03

The story follows McKenna's usual blend of wayward suspense with Mag being embroiled unwittingly in a fraud scam and a power game concocted by Marcus Worthington and his brother Faris. With her researcher boyfriend being silenced for his possession of a biometric Identipad , Mag has to assume another identity in Seattle. Nevertheless, she is followed by the obsessive stalker Faris. <br /> <br />McKenna's protagonist Davy is intensely brooding with bristling anger over his family troubles and wrecked marriage; Margot Vetter is a firebrand who refuses to be patronized by Davy's manhandling. Their chemistry and sex crackles with sizzling erotic tension. Everything about them seems out of control with the deceptions and secrets. Even the secondary characters like surveillance expert Seth Mackey, Sean, Tamara and Raine are oddly endearing in their own dysfunctional sense.  <br /> <br />But McKenna's villains need a major overhaul. Marcus and Faris are cardboard caricatures with zero emotional intelligence. It makes it hard for readers to empathize with these characters. It is precisely the flaws in the McKenna's protagonists that make them recognisably real and poignantly human. Her villains should also deserve the same amount of complexity.  <br /> <br />The epilogue is a tearjerker and every bit how a whirlwind romance between the polarized pair should end. McKenna's emotional ride offers no seatbelt but there shouldn't be any complaints. After all, isn't love supposed to be wondrously out of control? <br />	2005-04-25

To Die For is more a Chick Lit than a thriller but readers should have no complains. Howard reveals her most boisterous side since Mr. Perfect, using a first-person point of view to narrate how gym-owner Blair Mallory ends up being targeted by an unknown killer when she witnessed a murder of her arch-enemy. Lt. Wyatt Bloodsworth, who dumped her two years ago, ironically comes in as her protector. To Die For is more romance and fun than any of her recent efforts - and Howard's hilarious take on the mentality of Southern women is a hoot! Howard nails the characterization of Neanderthal Wyatt and cheerleader Blair and creates beautiful chemistry between the two. She taps deep into a woman's mind and makes Blair a complex character with fluff and grit at the same time. For once, Howard doesn't get too serious. Though To Die For isn't her best to date, but Howard seems to have so much fun writing this book that the humour becomes too infectious and engaging to resist. It's simply to die for.	2005-02-24

Yet Ms. Brown manages to acquit herself with crackling sexual tension between Rylan and Kristen. Rylan is the alpha-male bad boy actor who stays with widow Kristen Rumm to mold his screen role as her husband. He ends up falling for her while learning her struggles as Demon's wife. The deft dialogue and pacing helps to bolster the formulaic premise and as usual, Brown's acumen in seizing the emotions of romance readers renders this a serviceable read.	2005-02-22

Lady Vivian Rael-Lamont finds her peaceful life shattered when a Shakespearan actor threatens her with secrets of her past. In exchange for his silence and her marriage document, she is to hand over an original manuscript of a Shakespearean sonnet in Will's possession.  <br /> <br />Readers familiar with Ms. Ashworth works like My Darling Caroline and Winter Garden will empathize with both the flawed lead characters. Vivian is a beguiling pillar of strength and grace; Will is a tortured hero who is dark and brooding. As the plot and deception unfolds, the textured characterization comes full circle. <br /> <br />Even with some plot inconsistencies and too-modern dialogues, Ms. Ashworth's first installment of her Duke trilogy is quietly affecting and incendiary with its saturated chemistry and tender moments. The bodice-ripper is however never debauched because of the rich characters. It has passion and heart. Peppered with a rousing mystery and fast-paced suspense, this 19th century Victorian romance places Ms. Ashworth in fine form again. This is sinful indulgence at its best. <br /> <br />	2005-01-08

The haughty alpha male and town sheriff of Latham Green Ty Beaumont finds himself intrigued by the return of scandalized Sunny Chandler. The scorching beauty is rumoured to have jumped out of a marriage. As the story unfolds, the flawed characters are spurned by love - and are drawn towards each other. Feminists may sneer at Ty's manhandling but maestro Sandra Brown peppers the unbelieveable tale with heated dialogues and fast wits. It is clearly not Ms. Brown's best but as usual she is a smooth operator at testing the limits of credibility.	2004-12-10

We last saw the leader of the pack Sir Gawain Olsen being hunted by a mysterious sabotager on the peaceful isle of Cyrene. Viscount Christopher Thorne, who is a member of the group, pledges to find out the cause of death of his best friend Nathaniel who died during an investigation. Nat's cousin, Lady Diana Sheridan pays him a visit to discuss about Amy's (Nat's sister) season and her fortune hunter.  <br /> <br />Ms. Jordan's read might have been a sizzle in the bedroom but the characters lack depth. Readers who are smitten with Jordan's titillating dialogues and chemistry in the Seduction are not going to find them here in her latest. We see how Thorne uses his power to get Diana a place in the Royal Academy and manipulates her to marriage; Diana mourns about her past folly and because of her insecurities - agrees to Thorne's hiring of a Cyprian to seduce away Amy's love interest. The chemistry between the leads borders on eager prurience and lust - and carries forward to make Jordan's latest book a disappointment. The adventure and intrigue is more of the same formulaic setting in The Master of Temptation without much extension and details. Lord of Seduction captures and titillates but apparently this is not enough to hold our hearts.	2004-12-08

Her eagerly-anticipated tale on the Prince of D'Jai and consort to the faerie queen Aoibheal, Adam Black opens with him being banished to the human world and under an invisible enchantment. Gabrielle O'Callaghan is a Sidhe-seer and the key to Adam's chance of returning to his former immortal-self. Ms. Moning paces her zippy story with a mouthwatering hero and a feisty heroine, a tantalizing glimpse of the MacKelter brother and Adam's personal feud with an Elder of the High Council who plans to overthrow the Queen. Her time-travel research is as usual fascinating and serves to compliment with the mythic pull of the Tuatha De Danaan race. And it's even more remarkable that Moning stays true to the romantic genre in spite of the sprawling plot. She gives lots of hearts, tenderness and humor to the two central characters in addition of the sizzling sexual tension. As a romance fiction, The Immortal Highlander remains essentially a poignant ode to love, passion and its moving powers - and Moning gets all the key elements right, especially in crafting Black as a charming, devilish alpha male. It only leaves me with this caution: Avoid him at your own risk.	2004-09-13

Mary Janice Davidson first hits gold with her compilation of sassy contemporary romance Under Cover that brought her under the wing of Brava. Her first full length novel with Berkeley, Undead and Unwed, retains the sass and the brio - manifested in the pert heroine Betsy Taylor who rises from the dead to battle with a 500-year old vampire, Nostro as well as her manipulative stepmother who stole her Manolo Blahniks upon her death. The laughs are fast and furious especially with an ensemble of secondary characters like her loyal friend Jess and a gay sidekick. It is a vampire parody that digs from the closets of Dracula 2000, Buffy and even a stab at fellow paranormal writers when Betsy has the power to defy holy water and sunlight. It is unfortunate that the end sags but the delicious romance with brooding hero Eric Sinclair more than compensates. This outing proves that Ms. Davidson is uncompromising and undaunted to be creative. It is macabre, refreshing and savagely funny.	2004-07-16

Mary Janice Davidson first hits gold with the release of Under Cover - a compilation of sassy contemporary romance that brought her under the wing of Brava. Her latest full length tale, Undead and Unwed, is an irreverent vampire parody that digs out the stereotypes from Buffy, Dracula 2000 and a stab at fellow paranormal writers. Her Manolo Blahniks strutting heroine Betsy Taylor is a hoot who defies holy water and sunlight, and a pert heroine who battles with a dysfunctional family. The tongue-in-cheek humour and brio came too furiously in the first half of the book that the end sags in comparison especially in the battle with Nostro, the 500 year old vampire villain. Nevertheless, the dialogue sizzles with dry wit and the plot is refreshing enough to show that Davidson is a writer who is uncompromising and undaunted. Even the dark hero Eric Sinclair has an ultra-voracious sex appetite in his bedroom romp. This blood-sucking spiel is macabre, witty and savagely funny.	2004-07-15

Devil Takes a Bride is clearly Foley at her best when the tale launches quickly into a harrowing saga of vendetta and love with an opening sequence that tells of how Devlin Kimball, Viscount Strathmore's family gets brutally murdered. He infiltrates the decadent Horse and the Chariot's Club to find the proof that will nail the perpetrators. However his scheme takes a twist when his aunt bestows his fortune to her chaperon Lizzie. The characters, including the secondary ensemble like Alex and the astute Aunt Augusta sculpted by Foley are sparkling with intelligence and naunced emotions. Devil Takes a Bride juggles well with the pacing of suspense and romance, with fabulously detailed descriptions that showcases Foley's keen sense of the 1800s era. This romance is easily the best offering this year with its brisk, smart and sensuous narration that is oozing with debonair flair.	2004-06-15

San Francisco Homicide Lieutanent Lindsay Boxer's jog with friend D.A. Jill Barnhardt turns out to be an eventful one. She finds out that Jill is suffering from spousal abuse and an explosion rocks a townhouse resided by an high-profile Internet investor Lightower. The mystery deepens when Lindsay gets to save only one child from the inferno, while the other is missing from the scene. The chase is a suspenseful one, zigzagging from uncovering terrorism with the help of Home Security specialist Joe Molinari to solving the murders of an insurance CEO and one of the beloved member of the Women's Murder Club. Patterson and Gross keeps the tale at an emotional high with a final twist in the end that will have readers gasping. The Women's Murder Club gets more active in the scheme of things with tighter pacing especially with Cindy throwing baits to the mysterious e-mail sender and Claire facing the gruelling task of examining the ricin-poisoned bodies. The tale is gripping and real, with its theme of terrorism and social divide that is resonant in our times, making the convoluted plot believable and unsettling.	2004-05-15

Sherrilyn Kenyon's Kiss of the Night opens with a fascinating tale of Atlanteans and the evolution of the Apollites - and how the jealousy of goddess Apolloymi propels Apollo to curse the Apollites, condemning them to a life expectancy of 27 years. The last descendant of Apollo, 26-year old Cassandra Peters prepares herself for death until she meets Dark Hunter Wulf Tryggvason - who leads a solitary existence with his squire Chris. Wulf is her destined soul mate and when Cassandra becomes impregnated during a \\"dream mating\\", she is struggling to stay alive for her child as the evil Daimons and Destroyer Stryker hunts them down. Ms. Kenyon's fantasy world is blooming with imagination - and enriched with textured characters. Secondary characters like Talon, guardian Kat and even villains like Stryker and his son Urian are larger than life. Ms. Kenyon sculpts the characters with honesty and emotions, bringing to life a beautiful series that speaks volumes about love and redemption. The best thing is, Ms. Kenyon refuses to wax schmaltz upon readers even though some sex scenes may be over-indulgent. The dialogue, full of \\"Sex and the City\\" spunk and wry humour accelerates the pacing of the story to a frenetic one, faster than we can say - \\"More, please.\\" Kiss of the Night is one hell of a ride with its breakneck speed.	2004-05-15

Molding a locked-room mystery and some good old chemistry and romance, A Deal with the Devil tells of the harrowing escape of Lady Aubrey Farquharson with nephew Iain from the clutches of her scheming uncle Fergus. She poses as housekeeper Mrs. Montford in Lord Walfaeren's estate and gets embroiled in a murder of the Walfaeren's grouchy alcoholic grandfather Major Lorimer. Though the mystery lacks the finesse and atmosphere of her previous works like No True Gentleman, the romance between Aubrey and Giles touches genuine emotions. Ms. Carlyle astutely unites the brooding hero and the sassy heroine deftly with unspoken emotions in her descriptions and deep seated passion, sparing us from an overload of melodrama. The old plot devices work out beautifully with Carlyle's maturity in crafting her characters and sensible pacing. With a stable of memorable secondary characters like Delacourt, the witty Pemble and the roguish detective Max, A Deal with the Devil exudes full-fledged debonair charm.	2004-05-12

Again the Magic follows the conventional storyline of a doomed romance in the hierachical British peerage system with little surprises, but Ms. Kleypas draws her characters with empathy and heart. Readers will be captivated by the dark and angst-ridden McKenna who comes back to Stony Cross Park to wage vengeance after being spurned by Lady Aline twelve years ago and the flawed Lady Aline who can't trust McKenna enough to love her for her heart and not her body. They are all too human with foibles readers can identify - and along with the spunky Livia and a secondary romance developing between Livia and debonair charmer Gideon Shaw (who is an alcoholic), Again the Magic is consistently engaging even though it lacks the more intricate plotting in Ms. Kleypas' previous efforts. Ms. Kleypas clearly weaves her magic in this gratifying read, even though it is nowhere near her representative works.	2004-05-07

Haven't they done this story in the last book? Bad Boys Next Exit clearly follows the safe path that have garnered predecessors the popularity. The best out of the three tale clearly belongs to Shannon McKenna's Meltdown where headhunter Jane Duvall experiences  raw passion with hotelier Mac McNamara when she poses incognito to poach his management staff. The usual routine of boy meets girl gets revitalized by McKenna's consummate writing and luscious emotions manifested in the two textured characters who gets caught up in a whirlwind affair. Donna Kauffman's Exposed tells of two strangers' romantic interlude in a train while E.C Sheedy offers plenty of sass in redhead and PR specialist Ginger Cameron, who wants to be taken serious by ex-soap opera hunk Cal Beaumann enough to clinch the deal to promote his cinema. McKenna's gem of a tale gives this anthology the much needed momentum and drive to prevent it from heading towards deadening predictability.	2004-05-04

She lost a kidney in the fierce struggle - her husband and family too - as she forged herself to become stronger and never giving up hope in her quest for Justin, while others misunderstand and loses faith in her quest for an impossible dream.<br />Ten years in hot pursuit of the perpetrators has left Milla with a new link after a mysterious phone call that unites her with bounty hunter James Diaz. As the mystery deepens, she finds herself confronting a web of conspiracy spun by her closest friends and sponsors of her foundation that is dedicated to finding the missing. <br />The mayhem and cutthroat suspense may be similar to Ms. Howard's previous efforts like Open Target and Dying to Please. But in Cry No More, Ms. Howard outdoes herself as she throws herself into the world of her central character, bringing out the empathy and admiration for her steely Milla with gut-wrenching emotions. Her angst and bitterness makes her a gripping heroine in every sense; the hero Diaz with the dangerous slant unearths her softness and vulnerability,  enriching the poignant romance in the midst of the spinning action. <br />Ms. Howard clearly has shown that her passion overrides everything. She gets all her elements in place, beautifully injects realism with bits and pieces of Mexican culture, surprises us with an act of maturity by Milla in the ending sequence and lets us feel the unconditional love in maternal ties. This is simply Ms. Howard at her best - and it is bound to leave her fans crying for more.	2004-05-04

We last left off with the emotionless warrior banished to doom for the happiness of Sunshine and fellow hunter Talon and the mess he stirred up in New Orleans. His controller Ash compromises with the haughty Artemis on her decision to send nymph Astrid to judge his fate and whether Zarek is beyond redemption. She unexpectedly falls in love with the haunted man as she delves deep into his psyche and bitter past. Dance with the Devil bounces with a sparkling roguish charm and exuberant characters that Ms. Kenyon passionately shapes to life. Even this entry is not as imaginative as her past effort, Ms. Kenyon compensates with more engaging characters like the freakish hoot Simi and the complexed Daimon villain Dionsyus. The Greek mythic characters jump off the page in another captivating tale of vendetta and poignant love.

The tale excites with delicious cunning, pageantry and sorcery with Zuleika the Princess of Dariyabar outwitting his cousin Haroun to regain her hold of the throne. She strikes a bargain with her betrothed Amir Khan and with the aid of her genie Kansbar, she has to fend herself from the evil plots of the wicked harem mistress. Thea Devine and Jane Bonander choose a safer route with mediocre romances. &quot;All the Secret Pleasure&quot; by Devine is a tale that sees Simon Charlesworth convincing worldy widow Corinna Woodholme that she is to be his only choice in marriage; Bonander's simple tale is an encounter of love sparks between bachelor Ross Benedict and feisty Lily Charlesworth whose trust had been misplaced by her ex.

Talon of Morrigantes meets his match in the form of spunky artist Sunshine Runningwolf when his nemesis Calamus hunts him down for revenge. An intense struggle begins when the cursed Talon discovers Sunshine is his reincarnated lover and she becomes unwittingly an innocent target. Ms. Kenyon's imaginative spin blends authentically Greek myths and gods like Artemus and Ero while keeping the romance fiery with the sassy Sunshine who charms with energy and the tortured Talon as her protector. The dialogue crackles with fast humor and along with Ms. Kenyon's other endearing characters like the enigmatic Acheron, Kyrian and the embittered Zarek (featured in the upcoming Dance with the Devil), Night Embrace is a blast and departs from the current vampire fare cluttered with sex. Yes, it has lots of hot sweaty sex, but Ms. Kenyon sculpts her characters so well that they come leaping off the pages with emotions and scarred pasts in a fascinating scope of vendetta, rivalry and doomed romance. They are the ones who give this zesty and enchanting dark spiel heart and soul - and lots of attitude.	2003-11-30

Mercenary Ray Jean Vereker is hired by rich business whiz Eli Connor to rescue his spoiled brat of a brother Jeremy when he is captured by guerillas in Mataya. Ms. Foster expects us to believe that Ray is the manifestation of wonder-woman who chops and kick ass - taking the guerillas single-handedly with a few nasty punches. Eli is reduced to nursing the wounded heart of Ray when he finds out she bears the guilt of losing her partner in a mission. The worst part of it turns out to be when the recycled and obsolete plot device of pregnancy is used to convince readers of a happy ending. Ms. Foster clearly disappoints with this unexpectedly trite romance which offers raw sexual tension aplenty but not much of heart.	2003-11-27

Chase Chandler jumps on his chance for a big journalistic break when he is promised an interview by the wife of hotshot U.S. Senator Michael Carlisle. There is a condition attached: Chase is to protect their daughter Sloane Carlisle who ventures into Chase's hometown Yorkshire Falls in search of her real dad Samson Humphrey. <br />Little did he know Sloane is the woman with whom he had a passionate one-night stand. Chase's protective instincts is summoned by Sloane's dangerous predicament when the senator's aide decides to silence Samson to avoid a political scandal. Complication arises when their chemistry sparks love. Chase has to decide for himself whether to give up his ambition for commitment; Sloane faces a dilemma as to whether Chase is just an errant white-knight or a lover. While the plot devices are shamelessly cliche, Ms. Phillips writes with a tender heart for her characters. Peppered with robust humor and wits from Chase's mother Raina, Kendall and Rick, the Heartbreaker is a gorgeous and gratifying conclusion to the series - so much so you can't bear to see them depart.	2003-11-27

Under Cover as Davidson's full-length debut is assured and confident - with bawdy humor and sass intact. Her first tale, Sweet Strangers, is an energetic caper with security specialist Renee Jardin on the run. The biotech firm she is working for is hunting her down because someone has slipped the prized cardiac invention PaceIC into her possession. Her escape plan culminates in a reckless kiss with NSA agent Eric Axelrod but love gets complicated with mistrust. <br />The second tale, Lovely Lies, skids into an emotional course with out-of-work detective Peter Random chancing upon trust-fund heiress Lori Jamieson, who is on the run from her manipulative stepfather. Random ends up as her unlikely protector when this jaded man unexpectedly falls in love. Ms. Davidson resuscitates the buoyant mood with the last and best tale out of the three, Delightful Deception, where Dr. Thea Foster meets her match with the arrival of her new boss and whiz, Dr. Jimmy Scyre who wants Thea to devote her energy into manufacturing 'Faskin' to rebuild the esteem in his scarred sister. Ms. Davidson's best traits clearly lies in her quirky humour; she even draws references from Lori Foster and Thea Devine in the naming of her characters. While the second tale bogs down the nimble lark, it is a delightful introduction to a fresh voice headed for stardom.	2003-11-17

Deadly Promise, the sixth installment of Joyce's mystery romance caper continues to deliver on its textured and complex characterization. While New York City police commissioner Rick Bragg is hot on the pursuit for the mastermind behind a prositution ring with Francesca, he faces an internal struggle between the desires for his legitimate wife Leigh Anne and the deep betrayal he felt when she left him four years ago. An accident that leaves Leigh Anne's life hanging on a thread forces Bragg to re-examine his feelings for his wife.<br />Other characters also get an equally gratifying treatment from Joyce. Calder Hart reforms from a debauched rake to be an alpha-male who charms with wits and chivalry. Francesca matures in her handling of relationships as she distills love from friendship.

(Visitation, Book 1)	Books	2	3	6	N	N	A big &quot;No-no&quot;	Say No To Joe? is decidedly darker than Lori Foster's usual fare with its underlying theme of dysfunctional families and scarred childhood. Ex-bounty hunter Joe Winston has the hots for psyhic assistant Luna Clark. He is so infatuated as to follow her to Visitation, N.C to attend to her cousin Chloe's children after her demise. Joe Winston is the cheeky bleedheart who suddenly morphs into a prescribedly possessive and fiercely protective family man. Even Luna has problems believing the startling transformation. Ms. Foster sculpts heartening characters as usual in Willow and Austin but the plot sinks into a cheesy melodramatic mode with a flat-out mystery, abrupt character changes and an overblown shoot-out that completely drowns the romance element. This follow-up to Ms. Foster's successful series attempts too hard to be serious - a deviation from the scintillating formulaic entertainment that we derived from the other Winston brothers' romance. There isn't the reassuring heartwarming touch and emotional anchor that marks Ms. Foster's efforts. It is sketchy at best. Say No To Joe? It turns out I may have to pass on this one.	2003-09-08

Standing in the Shadows continues from the prequel, focusing on the romance between ex-FBI agent Connor and Erin Riggs.<br />McKenna's protagonists are as usual brooding and tortured. Connor nearly died from a fatal explosion masterminded by his nemesis Novak; he is betrayed by his corrupted boss Ed Riggs who is now put behind bars when Connor testified against him. He feels guilt towards Riggs' daughter Erin and dare not find her despite his deep-seated crush for her. Erin is scandalized by her father's misdeed and is saddled with unemployment. Her mother Barbara is afflicted with depression while her sister Cindy is led astray by new-found lover Billy.<br />When Novak escapes from jail, all hell breaks loose. Connor is determined to protect Erin and emotions run high. Erin and Connor are forced to acknowledge their passion but with Connor's scarred childhood and regimental father - Erin is not sure whether Connor's fierce protection and jealousy stems from his past history of mental depression. Erin learns from his colleague Nick that Connor is afflicted with paranoia. Frustration also comes in when Connor hinders her job as a curator for Celtic-antique owner Mueller. <br />McKenna's sophomore effort pulsates with sizzling tension and passion but her debut was more focused. The exquisite emotional intimacy found in Behind Closed Door is sorely missed. Behind Closed Door was shorter but was leaner and held much more impact in its balance of romance and thriller. Despite this, Standing in the Shadows isn't a disappointment. It is enriched by McKenna's blisteringly intense hero who gives the tale a tantalizingly dark, shadowy edge.	2003-08-24

Johnson's trademark sensual scenes burn and smolder but do not quite attain the erotic virtuosity as in her historical novels like Sinful and Brazen. Chloe, along with her friends, ponder whether their happy ending exists when relationships go turbulent. The most devastating of all is when Chloe had a one-night stand with Rocco and discovers later that he is &quot;engaged&quot; to a malicious, wilful brat Amy whose father is the determining factor to his success in his nascent business operations. Clearly unfocused, Johnson adds in dramatic antics and a new lover boy to spice things up. Unfortunately, Hot Pink doesn't live up to its hype.	2003-07-22

Dare has long seen through her deceptions as a manipulator when she spurned Dare for Earl Ivers seven years ago.     <br />Can Ms. Jordan get any better than this? The Prince Of Pleasure fuses a fascinating historical tapestry on realpoliticks in France,The Royal Theatres, horse-racing in Newmarket as a lush backdrop to the sensuous romance between Dare and Julienne. Ms. Jordan's protagonists brim with emotions and quick witted intelligence while the romance spins from a heart-ravaging conflict where Julienne sacrifices Dare to assure his inheritance and appeases his malevolent grandfather. Mistrust hangs when he caught her with Ivers who was intent on raping her; Julienne bears shame and treason charges as she flees with her sickly mother. <br />Pounding suspense and turbulent passion makes Nicole Jordan's latest her most balanced and sizzling read after The Seduction. The fiery and spicy scenes are never reduced to debauched prurience under Ms. Jordan's tight narration but instead glows with unfettered romance. The mystery is superbly-paced and plotted as a laudable sideshow to the well-developed romance. You finally agree that it is finally worth the wait.

Tragedy strikes Hope Prescott at her sweet sixteen when her minister of a dad and mom disappear in Texas - and the fate of her siblings including a foster brother Gabriel are decided by a bunch of folks. The four of them are separated and dispatched to different orphanages; seven years later - Hope works for an answering-service company operated by the kind Mdm. Nainci while getting her computer-science degree. <br />With her impoverished past, Hope believes in compassion and loves her clients but knows pragmatically that money is the only route to bring her to her lost siblings. She meets Boston wealthiest business whiz Zach Given when his company employs her service and mistakes him as his butler Griswald. He continues the charade when the friendship blossoms into passion, but lacks trust in Hope because of a past betrayal. <br />This tale of a mixed identity gaffe is robust with humor and banters with the excellent supporting cast of Griswald the butler, the wise Aunt Cecily and Zach's parents. It is a schmaltzy romantic tale with the two characters in charged symmetry when they cower from love because of their past. Zach and Hope shares chemistry that sparkles emotionally - and Ms. Dodd adds tenderness with Zach as the shining knight to rescue Hope from a mafia-mob boss and launch a search for her siblings. Ms. Dodd's courage to burst into a whole new world pays off handsomely - and we the faithful readers like her just the way she is - regardless of the times.	2003-06-10

Veronica Archer the scholar who opens an erotica bookshop is the link to the suspects. She helps him with the clues while Jack fulfils her passion. The sexual scenes stacked in a monotonous chain soon lose direction and even appear contrived, diminishing the development to the central characters. Ms. Kenner's latest lacks the chemistry sparks that her romances are lauded for and the denouement to the mystery seems far-fetched and perplexing. The romance just did not blossom smoothly with much details at hand - and also Ms. Kenner's obsession with the racy scenes. It proved too much of an overkill.	2003-06-01

It is a nimble lark that skims lightly on the juggernaut debate of outer beauty vs. inner beauty.

It is a light cautionary tale that warns us not to judge but instead see people in other lights. Tyler is in fact an assiduous man devoted to helping society whose merits are clouded by his \\"lady-killer\\" reputation. Carlie is strong and fiercely independent despite her scars.  <br />This solid romance completely overshadows the filler story by Julia Elizabeth Leto that seemed such a letdown. It was short, abrupt and undeveloped and she deserved better. It all boils down to an impetuous marketing act.	2003-05-31

They are only half-correct as The Fifth Victim is a vortex of sex, deceptions and gruesome mutiliations that is disturbingly dark. <br />FBI agent Dalla Sloan's hunt for the serial killer of his niece leads him to Cherokee Pointe, Tennessee where the killer is set to repeat the cycle of sacrificial killing of 5 women as in the other states. He finds an unexpected ally in the form of half- Cherokee psychic Genny Madoc who aids her cousin sheriff Jacob Butler to ferret out the culprit.    <br />This would have been a slasher flick if not for Ms. Barton's keen observation of small-town mayhem and secrets, flashed out by the sinuous relationships between her side-characters like the debauched reverend and his wife as well as the abusive mayor. Genny is the pivotal beacon of morality who guides the wounded Dallas with hope and love. Casting the abrupt ending and the profuse use of paranormal element aside, Ms. Barton brilliantly notches up terror and suspense with the precision of a blade - swift and sharp.	2003-05-29

Family bliss and a blooming romance with florist Dru Whitcomb awaits him but threats from his mother Gloria shatters his happiness.

You can't help but be skeptical. Yet Breathing Room is Ms. Phillips most exhilarating effort crafted by tight research of Tuscany that segues from Guarnacci Etruscan Museum to its delicacy porcini.<br />Dr. Isabel Favor decides to retreat to Tuscany after her accountant cheated on her and the loss of her fiance. Her stablizing mantra crashes - and at the spur of the moment she engages in a quickie with hot-shot actor Lorenzo Gage after some chemistry sparks between them at a side-walk cafe. He happens to be the owner of the farmhouse she has rented. <br />That's when you marvel at Ms. Phillips's ease and affection with her characters where clever quips and banters reveal their insecurity and how the pensive and cool-headed Isabel suits the chivalrous Ren to a tee with equal emotional needs. Ren is a cynic who believes Isabel is too good for his sordid past and hedonism; Isabel discovers life isn't something you can compartmentalize. <br />The mystery aside, Breathing Room succeeds with deadpanned humor and believable characterization. She deftly explores the foundation of marriages and love with a fallout between her side ensemble - Tracy and Harry.

Jet-setter and heiress Katya Morgan finds herself disinherited by her father in a codicil and her luxuries auctioned off. Her stepmother Jillian tries in vain to help; she has to pay off her stay at Royal Palmetto Hotel in Arizona by working as a hotel maid. Jillian coaxes general manager Alex Sheridan to offer her a position and this soft-hearted alpha male begins to shatter her defenses to people and even love and concern offered by Sheridan's grandmother Nana and sister Inez. <br />Brandt wisely avoids stereotypes and injects warmth and complexity into her characters. She engages readers to understand that money was the only connection to her father's love and how her mother's departure shuttered her. She avoids intimacy with Alex for fear of hurting. An unbelievable side-plot of a saboteur to the hotel provides some suspense but Brandt's characters including Daisy the dog and the quirk Mr. Egger hold their own along with Brandt's meticulous research in hotelier management for a more-than-serviceable read.	2003-05-25

The Sullivans who are Greenfield's descendents decides to trace the other two statues to complete the valuable collection. The Irish triumvirate consists of Malachi, the eldest who is attracted to mythology professor Tia Marsh in his information-gathering; Gideon, the second son gets hitched to cynical exotic dancer Cleo while Rebecca falls for Jack Burdett, a security expert who owes the third piece. Ambitious antique collector Anita Gayes is the villain who resorts to murder and deceptions to lay hands on the statues. While Three Fates is a jaunt of an adventure, the plot while sprawling remains assuringly predictable with a cliche villain. Roberts's most vivid portrayal is perhaps Cleo who is the most daring and vivacious out of the three. This resonates too the readers' desire for the more daring experimentation that appears in the earlier works of Ms. Roberts.	2003-05-21

Evie Ruddick is set to derive meaningful pleasure in her life by dedicating herself to voluntary work at the Heart Of Hope Orphanage, who unfortunately gets mocked by the director and notorious rogue of the ton Marquis of St. Aubyn whom ironically everyone calls &quot;Saint&quot;. This hardened cynic sets himself to seduce the virginial Evie while giving her a tour of the house. With no particular attachment to the orphanage, he agrees to sell to the Royal Prince to pave way for development - indirectly crushing the dreams of Evie. <br />Readers seethe at what a scoundrel he is and joyfully laud at his &quot;imprisonment&quot; at the cellars of the orphanage executed by Evie and the children. Isolation and darkness forces him to rethink and admire Evie's passion as well as falling inexorably in love. He reforms by taking political ambitions, making amendments while courting Evie, who is ruthlessly used by her brother Victor as a pawn to his political career. She is to marry the dull Lord Alvington and give up Saint. <br />Ms. Enoch heats the tale with sizzles and seduction but also manages to deliver responsible matured characters who are true to themselves. Evie weighs family obligations with love; Saint is a flawed man who admits mistakes and rectifies them. These are endearing creatures who make this lesson of love ultimately sobering and enriching.	2003-05-18

The wedding bliss that spread to Anna Thraxton and Anthony St. John in An Affair To Remember continues with the irrepressible sensual rake Brandon St. John finding himself hopelessly addicted to enigmatic widow Verena Westworth, a bohemian at heart and a shrewd cardplayer. Brandon never expects her to mock at a monetary bribe to leave his brother alone and he is determined to even the score until a treasonous scheme puts Verena in danger and summons his protective instincts. This scintillating romance with fiery sparks and memorable side characters like Verena's larcenous butler Herbert and Chase St. John is well-paced with mystery and adventure. As with every romance, the barrier to their love is the distinction of their classes and Verena's charlatan of a family gets a nice satsifying resolution from Hawkins. Karen Hawkins just gets better with each progressing story and this is no doubt an assured winner.	2003-05-17

However true fans of Ms. Cruise will be astute to call off the bluff - Faking It does not measure up to her earlier attempts, lucidly missing her relaxed, feel-good style. <br />She crams in too many characters when depicting a tale on the Goodnights who runs a respectable gallery. There is Gwen the matriarch and escapist, Eve who holds a double identity and a rambunctious daughter Nadine and finally Tilda who is the responsible one, stashing their forged paintings at the basement until panic strikes when one lands onto the lap of  golddigger Clea Lewis at a spring cleaning. <br />She attempts to steal but fate dictates she meets Davy Dempsey who plans to reclaim his 3 million from Clea after she collaborated with his financial manager Rabbit to rip him off. An unexpected alliance is formed; Davy moves into Tilda's home along with a hitman. <br />Crusie's dialogue is snappy prose and witty movie quotes from Ben Hur to Grosse Pointe Blank. It is unabashedly a hoot with surprising revelations on relationships as deceptions are unmasked. Tilda's insecurity stems from her dad's jealousy while Eve's scarred from love when she tries to change her husband's gay identity in vain. <br />Crusie tries too hard though to magnify a small-town mayhem into an opus. One feels unfocused as she narrates on the sprawling ensemble while missing her personal touches of character development. It is an intelligent romance of duplicity and brio that gets unneccessarily overcrowded.	2003-05-12

Judith is the impoverished daughter of a clergyman who journeys to Harewood Grange upon her mercenary Aunt Effingham's summon to chaperon her grandmother. Her stagecoach topples and the valiant knight turns out to be Rannulf. Instant attraction strikes and both of them pull their deceptions: she lies to him that she is a theatrical ingenue Claire Campbell while he just states his identity to be Ralph. Judith ends their affair with an abrupt departure, never expecting them to meet at Harewood Grange when he is on his way to woo her cousin in a bid to pacify his ailing Grandmother Lady Beamish.<br />Rannulf finds himself falling hard for Judith - and how can he not when we readers applaud her strength in resisting a marriage of honor from Bedwyn, her magnanimity towards his wastrel of a brother and her unwavering affection for her Grandmother? This vulnerable creature has always believed her glorious auburn mane to be ugly and shameful at the castigation of her father and aunt until she reveals her inner strength with Rannulf's encouragement. <br />And Rannulf earns her heart with his rescues of her from the perifidious cousin Horace while she claims his with wits and characters. Mary Balogh's Slightly Wicked is constantly moving and delicate with memorable characters who sees their relationship tested with trials. The poignancy we witness at Judith's forgiveness with her brother, father and grandmother shows Mary Balogh's relaxing her storyline but not the heartstrings.	2003-05-10

It is a romance at heart with ingenue Vermillian Lee Durant following the footsteps of her aunt Gabriella to become a cyprian well-craft in the arts of seduction. British cavalry Captain Caleb Tanner sneaks inside her manor as a groom to ferret out a treasonous spy and suspects Lee and her aunt. Smoldering passion soon complicates Caleb's investigation and leads him to believe Lee's innocence. The identity of the culprit abruptly comes out as a hasty denouement - disappointingly so when Ms. Martin painstakingly whips up paranoia in the mystery. Secret Ways thus establishes itself primarily as a sweeping romance, unfurling with Ms. Martin's magic in creating endearing characters with heart and affection.	2003-05-01

The beginning of each chapter is an excerpt of the horrid manuscript heroine Yank novice romance author Alix Freemar who moves to England in search of greener pastures. She meets neighbor sexy Scotland Yard detective Alexander Black who on first sight confiscates her spiky plant that he suspected was a marijuana plant. Tension heats up and the cnemistry flames with the banters and love.<br />All would have been better if Alix wasn't sculpted by MacAlister as a simpering self-centered waterpot who becomes gratingly irritating. There are occasional funny moments with her quirky characters including leasbian couple Bert and Ray as well as the astute Isabella who was once Alex's lover. Alix's insecurity is an excuse for her to accuse Alex of rejection when she doesn't show much consideration for his work and self-wallows in pity. It is fortunate though she straightens herself towards the end with a redeeming clause. It is uneven at times but Ms. MacAlister manages to steer through with wits, slapsticks and lots of heart for her improper, eccentric bunch of kooks.	2003-04-29

Within days, Sabrina acknowledges her father and is bestowed the secret to Brook's fragrance. She is ushered in as the president of Ruisseau Corporations. While things heat up between Dylan and her, danger lurks when a murderer slays off a co-worker and makes attempts on her life. It is fortunate that Andrea Kane's romantic thriller sculpts her character with definition and dimension but the disappointment sets in with her lack of exploration and continual throwing of red herrings to distract readers. Scent of Danger ends up being unsatisfying on both elements although the romance fared slightly better. It tantalizes but lacks the power to sustain and rouse.	2003-04-20

Her formula, this time, however cannot disguise the empty premise of a filler plot and salvage the agonizing romance between duchess of Magnus Madeline de Lacy and Earl of Campion, Gabriel Ansell. <br />You wonder whether how could a sensible woman like Madeline be so domineering to her cousin Eleanor to propose a switch in identity when her father gambles her hand away. She trades insults and surprisingly connive at her father's reckless gambling. She rushes to Chalice Hall for the reputed Game Of the Century to stop her father from losing the heirloom tiara and instead meets with erstwhile fiance Gabriel who came with a hidden agenda to revenge for his brother whose downfall was incited by the gamemaster Mr. Rumbelow.<br />There are light strokes of humor, lots of provocative banter and hot passion but there are even more winces when the hero is bent on punishing Madeline for jilting him at the altars and even risking her life to get back at the villain. When had Dodd's charming and endearing protagonists morphed to such spiteful creatures? The story is left with a hanger to hinge on her next story to this series Changing Places, that makes it unsatisfying.

You will feel for this fallen angel as he prays for redemption and forgiveness from his brother and Frederica. He shoulders an emotional turmoil that will choke you in its sheer ugliness, heaved upon by his own father and Cam's malicious ex-wife. <br />And cried I certainly did. Liz Carlyle's latest is an emotional rollercoaster with deft touches of lively brio from her supporting ensemble like Lord Rannoch, Helene and gritty intrigue from the Signora Castelli with her damningly accurate tarot-card predictions. The happy ending is a heartfelt triumph well-deserving for the weathered couple. Why, The Devil You know might be the best romance this year!	2003-04-11

Lord Aidan Bedwyn indebted to savior Captain Morris honors his last promise to take care of his sister on the Battlefield of Toulouse. It brings him to Ringwood Manor and the fiercely independent Eve Morris who provides employment and lodging to two abandoned children and an disabled Aunt Mari. She desires no protection from him despite her manor will be bequeathed to her vengeful cousin Cecil. Aidan discovers and marries her so that she may keep her manor.<br />The marriage of convenience soon gets complicated when Duke of Bewcastle, Aidan's brother, fetches Eve to London and expects her to fulfil her obligations as Aidan's wife. Spurred by dignity, she wills herself to be presented to the ton under the marchioness's tutelage and holds her own against Aidan's family. While love and admiration grows, interlopers like Eve's former lover and Aidan's hardened nature threatens the tenuous relationship.<br />Seldom is a Regency Romance attentive to its timing and atmosphere as Ms. Balogh moves the courtship from the rural Ringwood Manor to the glittering ton of London under Queen Charlotte's reign. The story unfolds with interesting revelations to the characters like Duke of Bewcastle's indirect gush of love and honor to his family, Aidan's vulnerable side as a soldier and Eve's passion for her children.<br />These are endearing creatures sculpted with emotional delicacy to spare readers from melodrama and sympathy. They instead earn our approval and instant respect in this superb tale of passion and redemption. Though no way surpassing her excellent A Summer To Remember, Ms. Balogh's rise as Queen of Regency is slightly progressing with another enriching love story.	2003-04-08

She certainly doesn't need the debonair Captain Morgan Pryce as a fence to employ her children stealing goods for him. Things aggravate when she suspects him to be in cahoots with the notorious smuggler ringleader in Spitalfield known as the Specter. <br />Equally difficult is the spying at hand with Clara as a mulish distraction with her luscious beauty and fierce protectiveness towards her children. Sparks fly and he has to keep her out of danger while working undercover for the Home Office to smash the smuggling ring. <br />Dance of Seduction retains the high-flying adventure and zesty fun in After the Abduction with Ms. Jeffries's smoldering chemistry in her couple. She compliments the spirited bohemian Clara with a darker and devilish protagonist Morgan who is haunted by his scarred childhood smacked in the chaotic rebellion of Geneva in 1770s. Clara's passion and generosity offers him hope to banish his past demons and his fear. <br />It has summarily the humor and entertaining side characters to enrich this emotional romance like as in her previous books. Here lies also our main worry that Ms. Jeffries will stay complacent while readers know her talents know no bounds. The success of Dance of Seduction should, instead, open the door to more experimentation.	2003-04-06

The task proves even arduous with the obdurate Captain jock Ty Gallagher who refuses to subject himself to the whims of his sponsor to upgrade their image with Armani-apparels and participating in charity events. What he wants only is to steer the team towards another Stanley Cup. <br />There is a complication though and that is Janna for the smart-mouthed lady gets into his head. She falls for Ty and recklessly engages him into casual sex, hoping that love will erase his obsession with his career. It is fortunate that Ty has a soft spot under his aggressive cloak after all. He helps Janna's friend Teresa through her near-rape ordeal by censuring his team-mate and secretly passes a ticket to a fan who can't afford it. <br />Body Check is in the same grain as Rachel Gibson's See Jane Score but focuses more on Janna as a publicist instead of the game itself like the latter. Which is fine when Deirdre Martin manages to personalize the story with the well-drawn friendship between Janna and Lou, drama, sizzling chemistry and a dose of deadpanned humor. This debut scores for its bounteous infectious fun, warm humanity and nice, ahem, sexual play.	2003-04-05

Romance fave Lori Foster whips up yet another irresistible invitation with fellow Harlequin veterans Donna Kauffman and Nancy Warren to aficionados to jump on board with the bad boys.And what a ride as Ms. Foster's scintillating story on tough undercover cop Sam Watson takes centerstage. Age gap and being his brother's ex prevents Sam from claiming the tempting morsel Ariel Mathers but that's about to change when she charges his way and foils his operation. The fiery sensual blaze in My House, My Rules continues with Donna Kauffman's sparklingly original entry Going Down? whereby overworked and underpaid secretary Callie Montgomery is trapped in an elevator with the suave business mogul Dominic Colbourne. This wrapped-up-in-a-day romance reigns supreme out of the three with delicate emotional intimacy and earnest characters. Nancy Warren's Fast Ride falters with her mediocre offering on DEA undercover Wes Doman suffering temporary amnesia in an accident in Harleyville who gets into a hot affair with his savior Nell Tennant. Juxtaposed to its two brilliant predecessor I Love Bad Boys and I Brake for Bad boys, Bad Boys on Board may not be the best but it's definitely worth the ticket price.	2003-04-03

Not surprising though, after all author Merline Lovelace was a veteran commander in the base in her military career that spanned 23 years. <br />After Midnight is hence an accurate and realistic story on Lt. Col Jessica Blackwell who is newly transferred to the base and is thrust with the unpleasant task of disciplining Sgt. Babcocks who vents his rage when his marriage went awry. Could he be the one who sideswiped Jess's vehicle?<br />It proves to be more of a red herring when Jess discovers the death of realtor Ron Clark and Reverend McConnell is linked to the rape of her mother Helen, repudiated by the town as a loose woman. Walton County Sheriff Steve Paxton investigates and protects Jess from a vicious killer in the midst. <br />This lean pulsating thriller brims with intelligence and is peopled with two strong protagonists with emotional complexities and wits. It is equally fascinating in its scope of oil distillation and barges. However none of these elements can rival the razor-edged suspense that comes fast and furious.	2003-03-29

The demise of his elder brother Jerome has lifted his banishment from Alvesley to assume his position as heir to Earl of Redford. Striking a wager with his friends, Kit intends to make the prosaic beauty as his wife. It's just too bad that Lauren isn't a simpering neophyte and Kit confesses honestly his agenda, only to be surprised that Lauren wants a brief romantic summer interlude with him. She will break the engagement and be free from the marriage proposals that her relatives thrust her. <br />They fall in love as in any romance novel but the courtship that segues from Vauxhall to swimming and tree-climbing is unfettered bliss and lush romance. Ms. Balogh weaves intimacy between the couple with tender passion and redemption. Lauren curbs her sunny side with her parents' departure; Kit is unable to forgive himself for the afflictions he caused on his younger brother Syd in his militant days.<br />It is at once heart-wrenching with denouements and poignant with family reconciliations. With maturity and grace, Ms. Balogh resolves the conflicts and adds depth to the ensemble of sub-characters including Syd and Lady Muir. She employs the healing power to soothe personal anguish in the characters with emotional delicacy. A Summer to Remember is unadulterated romance of such rare beauty and elegance that it will be remembered as Ms. Balogh's most glorious outing.	2003-03-23

His nascent peace is unfortunately shattered by quirky characters, particularly the red-haired siren and mystery bookstore owner Scarlett O'Malley and her senior patrons Ida and Mildred who are all aspiring sleuths and fanatics over the popular Smythe novels. <br />Patti Berg is a fervent aficionado of mystery too, evident from the small-town mystery and mayhem setting rehashed from the likes of Nancy Drew and Agatha Christie. She throws in a red herring by casting suspicion on the disappearance of the town's richest widow Opal whom Logan is seen to have contact with. Scarlett investigates the death of the lady with initials \\"E.G\\" in her bookshop with the assistance of her zealous friends. She soon finds out her stepfather and local sheriff Adam Grant, which she suspects of him silencing her mother years earlier, connected to the lady's death. <br />It is a zippy, fast-paced jaunt with mystery and romance. Logan is the strong, reticent alpha-male who shows infinite patience towards Scarlett's untrusting nature culled from her mother's disastrous marriage. This frustrates the readers and does little for their chemistry. Yet Stuck On You remains engaging with Ms. Berg's whimisical fun and infectious passion in her writing to make a captive of you.	2003-03-22

Amongst the international array of hostage is celebrated Opera chanteuse Roxanne Coss, vice-president Iglesias, a priest and others of Russian, French and Swedish origins with a Swiss Red-cross negotiator Jochaim Messner. Bel Canto is hence a story on the incarceration and the interaction of the motley group of terrorists with the hostage.<br />And what a story - told with lyrical prose and grace under Ann Patchett's observant eye. It is boldly imaginative of Patchett to use opera arias as the language that bridge the diverse group and transform the grisly labyrinth into a humane heaven of love and kindness. She treads desire and passion between the translator Gen and terrorist Carmen, fatuation in Hosokawa for Roxanne and kindness when Roxanne coaches Cesar in singing. The different myriads of romance and love are scripted with emotional delicacy and a sweeping magical realism that knits you to the forgotten community and haunts you with a shattering finale. Infinitely touching, Bel Canto is a gorgeous symphony on the transcendance of love and kindness.	2003-03-21

Yet all is forgiven under Johnson's careful sculpting of Jo as a graceful survivor and the confused Flynn humbled by the magnitude of his love towards Jo. She achingly lets readers into the bloodshed and solitude endured by the orphaned Flynn who embraces his love for Jo as a salvation. <br />Flynn's samurai heritage is scrupulously researched by Johnson as she delves into the exotic Orient, ronins and the legendary Musashi.

She hides Glynnis whereabout for fear that Zach the obstinate bull would destroy her newfound relationship with a good man like David Beaumont. Zach eventually discovers Glynnis is at Orca Island, Washington where David lives. <br />Their trip to Washington harbours one surprise after another when Miguel Escavez, one of the trainees in Columbia under Zach's wings hunts him down for a petty vendetta and his sister is mysteriously kidnapped by a treacherous insider of the Beaumont's family.<br />Susan Andersen's latest is a romp of an adventure galvanized by the lively rapport between Zach and Lily. She acquits herself nicely with an ensemble of quirky sub-characters and red-hot incendiary passion. The humor is sharp and fast with superbly paced suspense and dimensioned characters to make up for some incredulous twists of the plot. The romance between Zach and Lily is earnest, complimenting the poignant faith between Jessie and Christopher.

She escapes his boorish advances and flees to the neighboring Viscount Alton for help. Dominic places her under the care of her sister, Bella who launches her into the ton and the marriage cart - and finds himself enamoured of the young ingenue.<br />There isn't any romance to speak with when the bulk of the book is devoted to a hodgepodge of frivolous dances, social whirls and gossips, while the couple is separated for most of the time. As if their vast age-gap of eighteen years isn't a shock enough, the romance descends into an abyss when Dominic calls her \\"my child\\". Even more contriving are the tacky emotional issues that poses as obstacles to their romance. One can hardly feel any sparks or love between them when they are saturnine caricatures. If one is looking for wild passion, I am sorry but this book is innocent enough to be staid and certainly an aberration apropos with Ms. Lauren's caliber.	2003-03-15

Set in 12th century England, the plot revolves around the orphaned Imogen of Carrisford whose sheltered haven is besieged by Warbrick and Belleme, brutal warlords eyeing the Treasure of Carrisfordand defending Robert of Normandy against the ascension of Henry I. Imogen decides to enlist the help of FitzRoger of Cleeve as a paladin to reassert her claim over her castle and avenge for her father. FitzRoger wants her hand in marriage in exchange.<br />It is a straitlaced romance where the knight rescues the damsel-in distress but without the spunk and fire of Beverley's romance. Imogen is characterized as a guileless and naive ingenue whose foolhardy ways land the hapless hero in trouble. She remains untrusting of his intentions despite his valor and foolishly listens to a guilt-mongering priest who toadies to her enemy and discourages from consummating the marriage.<br />Undeserving of the knight in shining armour, I would say. It is fortunate that FitzRoger is the suave swashbuckling hero with wits and much patience. He gives character to the otherwise mediocre effort by Ms. Beverley. He champions this simple love story, set amidst Beverley's detailed historical landscape, to a harrowing victory.	2003-03-12

After an arduous incubation period, Mocha the peachick learns the real struggle, from his pheasant friends, is to survive the clutches of his Raiser (Andrew). Readers are immediately thrust into a world of pageantry and rivalry between the Indian and Black-shouldered peacocks and intrigue too, as Mr. Gleam the Beetle warns Aquarius the Indian Blue peacock of a scheme by the flies to eliminate humanity and his beloved Mocha. <br />A political satire like George Orwell's classic Animal Farm? Not so ambitious actually. This juvenile fiction by teenager A.A Browne is contented to be a rambunctious adventure with its imaginative spin and wonderfully expressive characters like Sapphire and Aquarius. The plot in its exposition of gadgets and operations of the beetles can be oft-confusing with jargons of UV codes but interestingly original as the plot unravels. The climatic battle, fortunately engages to keep the momentum of the story going, along with wry humour and antics. It remains after all a simple paean of faith in oneself and the fight for justice. An auspicious beginning all in all to a great series.	2003-03-12

Ms. Feehan decides to play the formula safe in her latest installment Dark Symphony that makes it hardly adventurous and a bland copy of elements found in her past novellas. <br />Byron Justicano, a shape-shifting vampire is drawn to his destined lifemate, blind musician and heiress Antonietta Scarletti and swears his loyalty to offer his love and protection. A hidden killer lurks in the dysfunctional family and threatens to kill Toni's beloved grandfather. Could it be her cousin Paul with an intent to secure the wealth, Toni's assistant Justine or the ambitious Frank?<br />Not that we care to know. Ms. Feehan bamboozles her way through this filmsy mystery of a plot with tedious repetitions while she focuses on Byron gushing mush to Toni who prefers their relationship on a sexual basis. The denouement of the killer comes abrupt and detached after cluttered chapters of spicy passion to make Toni surrender to love.<br />Dark Symphony when stripped of its dark atmospheric plush is empty without any fascinating gothic details and flat-out predictable. It is neither a soaring adventure like Sherrilyn Kenyon's vampire-series Night Pleasures. Even the love between Byron and Toni seems grudgingly unconvincing without chemistry and acts of sacrifices. Ms. Feehan fashions her story in the same mold that is as ancient as her vampire race and is too comfortable with her series to evince any breakthrough. Dark Symphony is sadly a flat diluted sonata and love can definitely come in more interesting forms.	2003-03-09

Suspects from the bar Rachel frequents are singled out along with her dates, imaging professor and a temperamental artist Hastings at Portography who holds images of Rachel - and the second victim. <br />Like an intense episode of CSI, J.D Robb swerves her 16th vehicle with a frenetic pace and futuristic crime procedurals with more depth in her central protagonists Eve and Roarke.  Marital blues storm ahead as Roarke traces his blurred pasts and discovers his father had brutally murdered his tender Irish maid of a mom. Eve is caught between her job and insecurities towards marriage, inducing a fragility that sheds away her resilient, edgy mantle. <br />Portrait in Death blasted off with a bold and imaginative concept on a gripping obsession of immortality and light but its denouements and depth faltered with Robb's emphasis on the action and characters. It is thus strait-jacketed into a futuristic thriller.<br />And plenty of thrills it gives - with the occasional snappy humor between Eve and her assistant Peabody to relieve the thickening tension. J.D Robbs draws her portrait with an atmosphere of darkness - stark in its deranged killer to his disillusioned motives and a wild climax to rescue a teammate from the clutches of the killer. This is a lean hard pulsating machine strictly designed to thrill with chills.	2003-03-08

Interweaving intriguing time-travel elements culled from hypothesis of Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawkings into this Scottish Highland romance judiciously lifts this novel beyond the standard fare. <br />Feisty physicist Gwen Cassidy on an introspective trip to Scotland Highlands discovers the preserved body of Drustan MacKelter - a 16th century warrior and descendent of the Irish Druids - and brings him miraculously to life. She reluctantly joins him on a time-travel journey through a sacred stone portal on the day of the equinox that turned awry. <br />Gwen has to save her soul-mate from the fate of being ambushed and drugged by a superstitious kinsfolk, unsuspecting that if the course of the past is changed with her successful rescue - they will have to part. <br />Ms. Moning as usual galvanizes with smoldering chemistry and passion between the two protagonists with the bawdy humour and smarts. KISS OF THE HIGHLANDER breathes life and emotions to the oft-confusing genre with focused narration, enlightening ideals and bouncy fun.	2003-03-08

First-timers introduced to Evanovich's style will be impressed but ardent aficionados of the author will know she is capable of better.<br />Full Tilt introduces wealthy millionaire Maximillian Holt and dirt-poor Beaumont journalist Jamie Swift as the protagonists teamed as partners to root out the culprits behind an embezzlement of tax fund scam. Max's brother-in-law Frankie, an aspiring senator determined to resolve the tax scam is the target of evil sabotages. His wife Dee-dee and her personal assistant Beenie are endangered. <br />Despite some bursts of quirky humour, the premise of the who-dun-it is thin and the characters here are sketchy and riddled with stereotypes including a programmed talking computer Muffin with an irritance that puts Jar Jar Binks to shame. Dee-Dee is the whining glamour-queen with her emasculated assistant. Even the protagonist Max is a shallow lothario and Jamie is a wisecrack -and you can't help but feel that they are perfect for each other. <br />The snappy prose and nascent chemistry is as such wasted on uninspiring characters and an unfulfiling mystery with an unbelievable romance. The fun started out good-natured but it gets a full-tilt to just prosthetic and superficial slapstick.	2003-03-02

Duke of St. Raven, Tristan Tresgallows chances upon the spirited Cressida Mandeville when he disguises as the notorious highwayman Le Corbeau and halts Viscount Crofton's carriage. Determined to save the innocent from the reputed lecher, he whisks her away to his retreat Nun's Chase, oblivious that he has foiled her plans to snatch back the treasure-secreted ivory statue that her father had lost, together with Stokeley Manor, in a gambling game with Crofton. <br />The rollicking adventure begins when Cressida bares her predicaments and St. Raven as the chivalrous knight errant steps in. They decide to penetrate into the Manor when Crofton holds his infamous sexual orgy and masquerade as a sultan and houri. Cressida is shocked by the decadence and oddly disappointed at Tristan's unsavory associations. She is however tantalized to the seductive masculine appeals of Tristan and knows love can never bridge the rank schism between them. Both of them fall in love against their wills. <br />Much of the intrigue is in the pursuit of the statue and Crofton's tenacity to unmask Cressida as the houri, which climaxes in a sharp battle of wits and lies to contradict Crofton's accusation. Corbeau, as Tristan's bastard cousin is the charming rogue who plays cupid to the reluctant pair. Jo Beverly is a master at her craft in creating simmering sexual tension and chemistry that sizzles and deftly avoids being vulgar in the detailing of the orgies. Her smooth narration compels readers to overlook the lack of resolution to the class distinction between the couple and the lack of emotional gravity that is surprising for a Jo Beverly's novel.  No regrets though, St. Raven self-admittedly is fluff-light and every bit an entertaining sexy caper that packs escapism to the hilt.	2003-03-01

Lead Me On begins with bestselling author Scott Lawrence traveling to Pearl Island Inn, Galveston with a fervent hope to cure his writer's block. Allison St. Clare operates the gift shop in her family-owned inn and is oddly fascinated with this celebrity. However her prim image and innocence dispels any thoughts of a fling from Scott's head. Allison is insulted at his lack of spontaneity and strikes a plan for a one-night stand where, much to Scott's surprise, she has a hidden sensual side. <br />Love and marriage never cross his hardened-cynic of a mind especially with his shadowed childhood and a notoriety of a dad - magnate John LeRoche. His father is suing Alli's brother-in-law Chance to get back the Island that he sold. There is a history in this island pertaining to Alli's ancestor Marguerite who had a tragic and unrequited romance with Captain Jack Kingsley. A pearl necklace bestowed to Marguerite was believed to bless the island - and LeRoche wants it back badly.<br />This secret withheld from Alli threatens to shatter the delicate trust and love between them. Add on to insecurity from a miscarriage and Scott's reticence about his family, the path to love becomes arduous. Ms. Ortolon poignantly explores love as a double-edged sword which causes joy as well as hurt with emotional turmoil that flashes out the vulnerability of her characters thoroughly. She intricately weaves an ancient phantasmagoric tale of unrequited love to mirror the devastations to relationships with the lack of trust. <br />The bouncy ensemble of side characters like Scott's niece Chloe and the St. Clare family beautifully add values of kinship and concern. Scott and Allison evoke sensual radiance and convince readers as a united pair. Lead Me On is emotional, sensual and utterly gorgeous and this coming from an author struggling torealize her dreams makes it doubly touching.	2003-03-01

Lady Pen Bryanston, confidante of the to-be Queen Mary is targeted by French Ambassador to the English Court as a source of information to Mary's well-being and succession to the throne relinquished after young King Edward VI's delicate constitution. He sends master spy Owen D' Arcy to seduce Pen - only to be attracted to her cool-headed front and courage. When she discovers Owen is a spy, they strike a bargain that he finds her son who was secretly taken away by her mother-in-law just after minutes of his birth while she acts the mole. <br />As such Jane Feather's romance is downplayed by the sprawling plot and intrigue. But what delicious cunning and treacherous betrayal to jolt readers into suspenseful tenterhooks! Ambitious dukes of Northumberland and Suffolk plan to oust Mary by making the ailing Edward sign the Device and conquer England; Pen outwits her cruel mother-in-law with a subtle allegation of treason. The climax saturates with the escape of Mary to her father and brother closely thwarted by the relentless pursuit of the dukes. <br />The subdued romance element is poignantly illustrated through Owen's dark secrets and protective instincts towards Pen. Jane Feather's protagonists are refreshingly matured and too level-headed to engage in sentimental romance. To Kiss A Spy becomes convincingly real and engaging to break free of the traditional mold. It is a rare gem that proves intelligence can be associated with romance.	2003-03-01

In fact bleedheart lothario Gabirel Cristofore is a gifted artist moonlighting as a social escort who offers carnal pleasures to bored widows and wives. His conscience is pricked when he is after Lady Elizabeth Harcourt, daughter of the social hypocrite Earl Norwich. At 27 and still a virgin, she conceals a sensual radiance which Gabriel is strongly attracted to and succumbs to temptation despite knowing that Gabriel isn't the material for love. <br />Holt's romance is ugly but at once brutally honest. Charlotte as the young stepmom of Elizabeth is spiteful and seethingly jealous of her stepdaughter but surely does not deserve the fate of being bounded to the violent Norwich who abuses and rapes her for a heir. Mary Smith is refreshingly worldly as Norwich's servant and secret mistress who later falls in love with Gabriel's dad John and regrets her earlier misplace of passion. Elizabeth is deprived of freedom and independence while Gabriel is spurned as a by-blow by his mother's relatives. Cheryl Holt's explicit sex scenes unflinchingly flash out the evil, flaws and naked pleas to be loved and understood. <br />Absolute Pleasure, as such, is a straight hate-it-or-love it affair that is certainly out of the mainstream romance.

Her trip to catch Sid in flagrante delicto brings her to the unsavoury side of Charleston and meets transgender Debbie who is actually a straight hunk PI Mac McQuarry, disguised to catch an unfaithful husband for his client. He rescues her after some thugs absconded with her Jaguar - and she begins to trust this stranger.<br />Mac, however plans to secretly distill information from Julie about his missing brother Daniel who, he suspects, had been silenced by Sid when he possesses evidence of his drug-dealing business. He ends up fighting his strong attraction to the luscious beauty and protecting her from a hired assassin sent by Sid.<br />Karen Robards's contemporary romance thriller is unabashedly predictable and cluttered with cliches of the genre right from the tall, dark and dangerous knight errant and alpha male to a feisty beauty queen. It is fortunately just as gleefully indulgent as the chemistry between Mac and Julie scorches to a sizzle high with heated banters and humour. The incendiary passion and some terrifying moments of suspense in this book too, is definitely no stranger to any fans of Karen Robards familiar with her work.	2003-03-01

However this time round in Forever Blue, Ms. Brockmann notches up this saccharine romance with elements of small-town murder and mayhem when the hero, Blue McCoy is suspected of killing his stepbrother Gerry after his wedding reception. It reveals later to be a decoy to frame McCoy given his former attachments to Gerry's soon-to-be-wife Jenny Lee. Lucy Tait, who harbours a teenage crush on the SEAL is implicated when she is assigned to investigate. She takes him in when the community at Hatboro Creek repudiates him and accuses him of cold-blooded murder. Sexual tension arises with their closed proximity and as Blue comes to terms with his love for his ardent tenacious worshipper. Yet Lucy is reluctant to believe that this fairy-tale romance could ever come to fruition with the more beautiful Jenny Lee as a rival. <br />This wildly schmaltzy tale, coupled with a to-die-for brooding hero and a feisty rookie, is a top-notch dazzling romance. What with the frenetic pacing of action and twists to compliment the soaring romance, this book under Brockmann's glorious pen vows to enthrall and leave you swooning with passion.	2003-02-16

Taylor O'Toole, a suspense writer has become the victim of many sabotages including a mountaineering accident and a hostage-taking in a convenience store ever since she helps her friend Candace to stalk her love-interest Harris Rain. It soon reveals to be a sprawling plan where secret biological weapons are manufactured for terrorists and a military scientist is being kidnapped. Jack Broussard is dispatched to watch over Taylor and sparks fly between them. <br />Hot Pursuit, alas, is unevenly paced and the suspense element which has lots of gaping inconsistencies fails to impress. The relentless chase, along with Taylor's abrupt knowledge of herself being adopted as well as her refusal to be ordered about by Jack hardly leaves any room for character development. It has none of the spunk and panache for a Christine Skye's vehicle. It started off well but ends up with too many surprising conclusions. Which is a pity when there are occasional terrific moments of danger and passion. The pursuit, regrettably, always seems to cool off after that.	2003-02-15

Fanatics of Rachel Gibson will realize that See Jane Score is a continuation of her deviant style of putting polarized opposites together.

Her female protagonist, Seattle Times Reporter Jane Alcott is assigned to the native Chinooks Hockey Team on a Sports Tournament coverage. She is immediately repudiated by the team because of their supersitition: women are jinx. Her drab black apparel and small breasts doesn't score well for the notoriously aloof but hunky golden player Luc Martineau either. It is before long they got her boot out - only to change their fickle minds when her departure well-wishing blessed them with a triumph.<br />See Jane Score is immediately a hysterically hilarious romp with Jane's sardonic wits and encounters especially in the locker room. Ms. Gibson 's scrupulous research on hockey sculpts the pulsating games and camaderie between the players through witty jargons, inside jokes as well as the pressure and sweat. <br />In all its slapstick laughter and wicked digs, See Jane Score is also a romance with dimensions. Jane considers herself a fraud being an anonymous sex columinst for a porn mag and a vulnerable girl at heart; Luc fears love as much as he is clueless to taking care of his adolescent sister Marie. Ms. Gibson injects a dose of searing intimacy and honesty towards her characters to make the Opposite + Tension and fairy-tale formula work to her favour. They are refreshingly matured and open about their feelings. Let's not forget the sex either. Ms. Gibson scores a hat-trick on that one too.	2003-02-11

However as we read on, the opening scene becomes tragic as Nick succumbs to lust to purge his guilt and nightmares of his afflictions during his imprisonment.<br />Worth Any Price is immediately a haunting romance that triumphs with passion and poignancy - and a superb follow-up to its equally measured predecessor Lady Sophia's Lover.

The best moment of the read - the climactic declaration of love - is especially priceless.	2003-02-09

This Regency romance gem of an anthology orchestrated by New York Times bestseller Julia Quinn comes timely in the schmaltzy Valentine season. These four interconnected romance tied by a skating event and Lady Shelbourne's grand Valentine ball are consistently engaging through the observations of Quinn's popular gossip columnist Lady Whistledown that opens every chapter of each story. These four leading ladies gamely joins in the season of scandals and romance starting with the meltingly romantic One True Love by Suzanne Enoch where Lady Anne Bishop is surprised by a sudden visit from her nonchalant childhood betrothed - the Marquis of Halfurst who is determined to pursue her and claim her surrendering heart from his rival Lord Howard. Karen Hawkins fashions her story with timeless chemistry in a conventional tale of how the gauche Liz Pritchard finally gets her friend Royce Pemberley to confront his feelings towards her when she intends to marry the bland rancher Lord Durham in Two Hearts. Ingenue Mia Ryans throws in a delightful fluff A Dozen Kisses where the simpering Caroline Starling attracts the dashing Lord Darington - the man who evicted her mother and her from the house. <br />Just when you thought the enjoyment was too good to be true, the always- reliable Julia Quinn waltzes in with the most refreshing tale out of the quartet - Thirty-six Valentines with her splendid acumen of wits, humour and passion. Susannah Ballister, after suffering a humiliating thwarted proposal from Clive Mann-Formsby finds a second chance in his reclusive brother Earl of Reminister, David. Ms. Quinn weaves her saccharine romance through a memorable skating affair, a seductive theatrical evening at Theatre Royal and the denouement of feelings between the brothers. The consistency of the four simultaneous romance is a rarity and the pleasure derived from the read is positively infectious from the chutzpah and energy of the four writers. Who ever said Regency Romance was a bore?	2003-02-07

Duchess in Love features the delightful duchess of Girton, Gina receiving her sculptor of a husband, Cam Serrad who escaped his matrimony 12 years ago to the then 11-year old Gina. Through these years they communicated on letters and Cam returns to London again by the summons of his father's solicitor Mr. Rounton to settle his estates and to grant Gina an annulment so that she can marry the starched-up, prim-and-proper Marquess of Bonnington. <br />What Cam did not expect was the revival of love and lust for the now grown-up Gina. The comedy of mismatched lovers and scandals spirals into several surprising twists to flesh out the nuances of her side characters. Lady Perwinkle finds unrequited love with the return of her husband while Esme is trapped in a loveless marriage and yearns for a child. Eloisa James gives a hilarious and tender portrayal of desires and passion clashing with obligations and sensibilities where the central clueless couple Gina and Cam unravels secrets of Gina's half-brother and illicit mother through a sculpture of Aphrodite. It is a laugh-out riot with her clever usage of Shakespeare's play Much Ado About Nothing to spice up the interplay of witty quips and insults. With empathy and grace, Eloisa James proves there can be a new world after all in the over-recycled and stereotypical genre.	2003-02-07

It focuses instead on the impact of their torrid affair as Kincaid and Francesca wallow in the emptiness of their lives as they revive memories. It is a cutting miasma of depression as Waller explores the fragile humanity through Kincaid's isolation and his unexpected legacy while Francesca continues to speculate the what ifs. The starkly heartbreaking landscape Waller paints through poems and details at Big Sur in 1945 as well as a short-lived affair renders this trip back to Madison County a frutiful one. Its lack of drama makes it quietly affecting and recognisably real.	2003-02-02

He has evidence that her mother Irene has recruited an arsonist to cause the fire that killed her alcoholic stepfather and intends to blackmail her. Ian, meanwhile, who is just released from prison is pursued relentlessly by a betrayed mob boss Arturo. On the day of the exchange, Ian is brutally murdered and homicide detective John Ryan takes charge of the case. Just when Abbie thinks the nightmare is over, a deadly enemy awaits to turn her life upside down again.<br />Deadly Intent is high octane razor-edged suspense nifty with twisty red-herrings and jarring drama - and Christiane Heggan makes every of her characters relevant to the central plot, drawing out the usual suspects and motives. Ms. Heggan renders credibility to the story with a sense of time and venue in Princeton and an ordinary lukewarm romance between the protagonists Abbie and John that is believeable with emotional honesty and the right chemistry. Few can refute the story is bland when it is a rollercoaster ride of deception, mystery and vendetta and the desperate search of a mother for her son. No grand passion? Sorry - but the excitement is enough for me. Deadly Intent is an adrenaline rush from start to finish.	2003-01-27

Her latest attempt marks her triumphant return in fixing the glitches, making Lady of Desire one of her most compelling novel after The Duke. <br />Ms. Foley's artful narration is a vicarious thrill from start to finish as she dissects and defines the central protagonist Billy Blade as an intelligent cunning gang-leader in the rookery fighting for survival in the seedy underbelly of London 1816. We cringe at his memories of being a mud-larking beggar, his narrow escapes from malevolent arch-rival O'Dell and his encounter of the ferocious The Fire Hawks gang. The pivotal moment of his adventure turns out to be the one he is captured to Newgate in a burglary sabotaged by O'Dell. To escape hanging and to pardon the death of his captured friends, he has to seek help from his vitrolic father - marquess of Truro and agrees to reclaiming the title of Earl of Rackford. <br />The spirited bohemian Jacinda Knight is his love-interest but one who refuses to marry because of the desire of independence. She is inspired by her mother Georgiana who dictates her own choices in lovers but her resolve is crumbled as she learns of passion with Rackford - and that this is a man who cares about her and is willing to change despite his bitterness from his abused past. <br />With a tortured hero and a feisty heroine sparking off scorching chemistry and smoldering passion, Lady of Desire is gauranteed a top-notch romance with energy and adventure. Ms. Foley is relentless in bringing tension and dimensions to her tale as she interweaves loyalty and fraternity through the comrades of Billy's gang, forgiveness for a scorned father and unexpected poignancy in a tender romance that will have you rejoice with tears. There is no compromise in the materials as Ms. Foley's thorough research sculpts the acrid alleys of London's underground and the sweeping glittering balls of Regency-era and is attentive to the double standards between opposite sex during the times. Ms. Foley's complexed tale and superb narration paints a vibrant portrait of love, struggle and forbidden desires with strokes of light humour and a bold scope, making this one of the most compelling romance in 2003.	2003-01-26

Yet destiny dictates that he meets a runaway bride Kendall Sutton on a SOS call who has come to Yorkshire with the intention of selling her aunt Crystal's house away before moving on to Arizona.<br />The romance between an itinerant soul and a wounded heart hurt by a foiled marriage holds the hefty emotional baggage and obstacle here. Kendall secretly yearns to settle down but believes that like her peripatetic parents - she could never have a real home. Rick, meanwhile is afraid to risk his heart. Carly Phillips brings heart and poignancy to this frothy romance with her ensemble of amicable characters like the good-natured Raina and Kendall's abandoned sister Hannah. The overwhelming chemistry between Kendall and Rick compensates for the lack of surprises here but without the bog of exposition as in the first episode, The Playboy runs along smoother and better.

Cabot's central protagonist New York Journal gossip columnist Melissa Fuller is burdened with the task of taking care her neighbour's dog and diabetic cats when she is mysteriously attacked and rendered unconscious. She contacts Mrs. Friedlanders's nephew model photographer Max in the midst of a vacation with his hot date - never expecting the irresponsible Max will renege on a favor from high-school friend John Trent. John is to deceive Mel into believing he is Max while he is happy gallivanting. <br />The plan is foiled when love enters the equation when John, actually a crime reporter with rival publisher Chronicle and low-key wealthy millionaire is enchanted by the simple Mel without the fuss. Even her friend Nadine believes that there is more to meet the eye in this perfect Adonis. When the deception is revealed, will Mel forgive John and solve the mystery behind Mrs. Friedlanders's attack?<br />Meggin Cabot distinctly emerges as the freshest voice of romance with this frothy romance where the communication by e-mails gradually provides an intriguing glimpse to the hearts and thoughts of the ensemble of goofy, tender characters such as Mel's best friend Nadine and the glam-queen Dolly as they play cupid to the clueless couple. It is utterly hilarious and the pace gains its momentum through the dramatic courtship, gossips, advice dished out by Mel's parents, John's sister-in-law's interference and of course - complaints to Mel's tardiness.

Of the three featured tales, Thea Devine's Her lord & master pales in comparison to the far superior Susan Johnson with From Russia with Love and the sensual mistress Katherine O' Neal with her torrid Erotic Deja vu. <br />Susan Johnson tones down her usual vulgar sex with a poignant passionate story of the resilient Tatiana who is dictated by Ivan The Terrible to marry the ogre Prince Shuisky to strengthen their alliance in Russia 1570. She meets the suave Stavr Biron who campaigns for Ukraine while being sequestered in Livonia with her child Zoe and falls in love. The danger arrives when Prince Shuisky is consumed with jealousy when his \\"possession\\" is taken by his enemy. Erotic and sensual with tender affections, Susan Johnson explores a forbidden passion with empathy and masterful narration. <br />The second tale by Thea Devine is an immediate turn-off with the unconscionable Earl of Wick taking a fancy to deflower virgin. Jenise, upon seeing her sister Julia being cruelly casted away by Wick decides to teach him a lesson, only to indulge in the rapturous surrender of sex. The sex marathon soon becomes gratuitous, monotonous as the romance element is stripped away by the explicit and crude manhandling, inducing more of a nasty shock for readers. <br />Katherine O' Neal's tale is cluttered with numerous blatant sex scenes but is starkly original with its surreal realm and a surprising twist. Celia Wybourne, the scandalous erotic romance author travels to Gibraltar and finds that her destiny entwined with a mysterious stranger Royce - in several past-lifes - with tragic consequences. The attraction to the story is not immediate but on a progressive mode. <br />With excellent predecessors such as Captivated and Fascinated, Taken By Surprise falls short with the romance diminished by debauchery and lack of character development. It is fortunate that Susan Johnson and Katherine O' Neal dishes out enough surprises to neutralise Thea Devine's shockingly bad tale.	2003-01-21

Now in London 1816 - a man is killed and bears a pebble - a signature killing style exclusive to Piers. He tracks down Letty, Pier's sister through Jane Mayberry - a resilient independent bluestocking who staunchly defend woman's right - and amazes Case with her strength. As passion develops between them, Jane faces danger from Piers in sabotages and a vitrolic ex-husband. <br />Readers who are familiar with Thornton's work will see her repeating the same winning formula deftly weaving palpitating suspense and murder with a knock-out twist towards the climax. The romance between Case and Jane steers wisely clear of prurience and bolsters on admiration to nurture an achingly tender love where Case becomes the protector. With an ensemble of defined sub-characters including the hauntingly disillusioned villain, Thornton's latest is almost an instant winner even if without any surprising breakthrough.	2003-01-11

Adrian is secretly mocked in the society for his less than illustrious birth and thinks Hester is another society's snob but later finds her concealing a deep secret and lusting after the prim mistress of Mayfair Academy.<br />Rexanne Becnel is guilty of portraying her characters with modern sensibilities in this Regency-era romance but it is a guilty pleasure as we indulge ourselves seeing Hester and Adrian in a forbidden tryst.

The uncompromising characters reveal their dimension through several stunning revelations of secrets such as Hester's birthrights and an elopement. <br />Hester is enigmatic while Adrian is dark and brooding - and the handsome couple sizzles with palpable chemistry.

Sir Bishop of Lythe is rewarded by King Edward I to be the heir of Lord Vellan and stake his claim on the much-feared Penwyth Castle in Cornwall. He must wed Merryn de Gay who is rumoured to be cursed by Druid spells and alledgedly destroyed the four men who tried to compel her into submission. Bishop intends to find out if the curse exists or whether it is merely a coercing farce by introducing himself as a wizard. <br />It is unexpected that Bishop experiences an otherworldly dreamscape in his pursuit abruptly and readers are hurtled towards the overlapping story of an ancient wizard finding his love Brecia in the oaks forest and they run into their nemesis Mawdoor. Catherine Coulter establishes a brittle and jarring link between the two stories that ruins the momentum of the first story as the main protagonist Bishop is clueless as the readers are. Worse still - Bishop and Merryn are such potential characters with much to be explored but Ms. Coulter seems to be enjoying herself too much to be detached from the paranormal world with splashes of magic and sorcery. <br />There are the occasional moments of sparkling delight and bawdy passion but the plot does stultifying injustice to the attractive characters sculpted by Ms. Coulter. There is part adventure and danger as well as mayhem and passion. However we seem to be assimilating them in confusing, bewildering patches. Its sprawling tale may be majestic but the lack of cohesion is a much regretted curse.	2003-01-02

An SIS spy for the English, he has earned the hatred from Hakeem - the honcho of the fearsome terrorism organisation Al'alim when he killed his son. Hakeem's brother Omar has commandered his son Wasim to kidnap the daughter of Theo Constantine - a influential Golnar businessman and will set her free on the condition that they release their imprisoned brothers. Theo enlists the assistance of Ellen Denby who heads the protection agency and his best friend Nikos without knowing they were erstwhile lovers. The tension between them stems from a deep hatred when their short affair compromised Ellen's life -and caused unbearable grief for the loss of a loved one which is unknown to Nikos. <br />With searing poignancy and complexed characters, Beverly Barton brings a resonant drama on lost innocence, guilt and remorse that pulsates with the rhythm of frenetic action. Ms. Barton's scrupulous research on espionage and military operation breathes realism into the plot without forsaking on the romance and kinship. She makes every side-character including the grieving mother Dia, comrades Sawyer and Lucie textured and relevant to the plot and even concocts a beautiful secondary romance between the nanny Faith and tough-guy ranger Worth.  Yet the element that excruciatingly tugs our heartstrings is the bittersweet romance between Nikos and Ellen where it shines with compassion, smoldering passion and ultimately forgiveness. The unguarded emotions found in this elegant and simple tale makes this one of the best read I have had this year.	2003-01-01

Dark Water is at once a gripping thriller of restaurant operator Sarah Whitman returning to Marmet, Maine to seek redress of her grievances. Two decades ago, Franklin Whitman vanished with charges of embezzlement of the bank's money leaving Sarah to face the discrimination of the community and the devastating suicide of her mother. Now Frank's corpse has resurfaced - and Sarah finds herself believing in the innocence of her father - along with love-interest Tony DeMarco where Frank is his benefactor.<br />Sharon Sala steers the formulaic small-town mystery with a dark overtone and pulsating pace, brilliantly notching up the suspense with an ensemble of shadowy characters with plausible motives and atmospherically conveys the terror through swampy lake and dark water as a mirror of evil. She juggles the romance element by introducing Tony as a protector who jumps past the defenses of Sarah and into her heart. Her sub-characters are memorable - such as the psyhic Aunt Lorett who glosses the story with a surreal supernatural realm. However what makes Dark Water a riveting thriller is its emotional core - of Ms. Sala and the heroine Sarah - both fighting against odds as survivors and pursuing their happy endings with gumption and guts.	2002-12-29

A murderer dubbed the Avenging Angel by the press has been slaying off abusers linked to Rachel's House which shelters  battered women and is operated by beautiful Regan Keller. Lynne Graham is the detective piecing out the puzzle; Alexander Courts under the instructions of his mother is sent as an undercover aide to the unsuspecting Regan. <br />Ms. Dare's latest thriller is dark and gripping given the theme of abusal and jolting scenes of victimized women. Yet it is also psychologically more complexed and textured as Ms. Dare points out the flaw of such vigilante actions where one jealous and parochial wife took advantage of the system and ended up killing her husband indirectly. It teases our moral choices on whether to applaud the killer or solve them through the legal system. The romance budding between Alex and Regan provides an interesting diversion to the intriguing who-dun-it where new suspects with motives flashes steathily. <br />It is a romance with intelligence and Ms. Dare's experience as a cop certainly brings more credibility to the portrayal of Lynne and Drew who are detectives and ex-husband and wife with left feelings for each other. The lives of these characters engages us with dramatic highs - one tide after another - in this gritty pulsating thriller seething with vengeance.	2002-12-25

Their path to marriage, she will discover, isn't simple after all. Ms. Malvey adds spunk and passionate sensuality to the formulaic Regency with the amicable couple and an ensemble of vibrant side characters like Harriet's guardian aunts Agatha and Hilda. She adds depth to the simple courtship romance with obstacles for the couple to weather and makes us convinced of their conviction for each other. A spirited and merry chase indeed.	2002-12-23

Seven years ago impoverished waitress Jessie Adams gets a proposal from devastatingly gorgeous business exec Joshua Falcon - but it is a cold unfeeling contract. The awkward Jessie has matured with grace and yearns to have a child of her own, seducing the unsuspecting Joshua only to find herself believing that there is more to the hardened exterior of Joshua. They share their ravaged childhood and Joshua slowly begins to trust but when she conceives - he believes that it is a deception to ensnare him. Cherry Adair stages fiery passionate interludes one after another and tugs our emotions with their personal dilemmas and fragility.

Ravyn Verdier, a communications specialist is left to fend on her own when a mysterious killer wiped out her crew, displaying their mutilated bodies in a floral pattern. Damon Brody, a Western Alliance Ops Spec receives their distress signal and rescue is set in full swing - only to find his crew massacred yet again leaving the both of them alone. They escape to Old City - a forgotten civilization of ailens while Ravyn's brother Alex and best friend Stacey is on the way to their rescue.<br />The futuristic romance attempts to salvage its plunge of ridiculous turns and anti-climax with smoldering passion. The futuristic milieu becomes a disposable one since Ms. O'Shea stages one passionate interlude after another; the romance element strengthens while we lose interest in the futuristic scope. It could have been a cautionary tale of dystopia or an intergalatic adventure with new possibilities but she seems contented on her narrow exploration of spaceships and space creatures. It instead strays into the paranormal realm with &quot;energy transfusion&quot; and laughable ideas of &quot;powering it with love&quot; to annihilate the monster.<br />I can appreciate a passionate romance but having said that, Ravyn's Flight cannot possibly be the benchmark of futuristic romance - when masters of the genre like J.D Robb are far more advanced and light-years ahead in their plot-structuring. It stays as a fleeting read of passion - no more, no less.	2002-12-19

Her nephew - a football quarterback - Trent Gamblin comes to retreat for a period of convalescence before embarking on a summer camp. Trent is intrigued by the prim and proper Ms. Ramsey and wonders why she is hiding behind unflattering apparel. When love strikes, he wonders whether Ms. Ramsey is really the simple girl she proclaims....<br />Within a laconic 200 pages, Sandra Brown weaves a textured romance with sensual sparks and wispy humour that sizzles with chemistry from Trent and Rana. Yet what makes The Rana Look exceptional is its underlying theme on beauty and inner character which makes it relevant in the times of superficial consumerism. Trent finds himself comfortable with a woman without frills; Rana learns to live for herself rather than being manipulated by her shallow mother. It is ultimately about choices and acceptance of one self. <br />Detractors may say it is not deeply insightful but be reminded that this is but romance. There are enlightening valuable lessons that are subtly broached in this first-rate romance which is entertaining if you skim on top of the surface; deeply moving if you discern it as more than a romance and look beyond The Rana Look.	2002-12-16

When Yorkshire sheep-farmer Emma Hotchkiss extracts a payment from him through chicanery for the sheep his carriage ran into, he decides to threaten her into a scheme to hoodwink his uncle into surrendering the statue. The game of betrayal and deception turns personal when Stuart seduces Emma into bondage and saunters into her heart....<br />Ms. Ivory's latest historical romance extrapolates her style of anachronistic prose and focused character study. Untie My Heart is heady seduction and lush passion that sizzles with erotic virtuoso from her spicy descriptions which assails the senses. Her intelligent and charming protagonists are sprouting constant surprises and revelations through intimate sharing of their personal lives and thoughts that gives readers an insightful understanding and room for budding attachment. Emma is a widow haunted by the drunkard of a husband; Stuart is disillusioned by his father's abuse. Their relationship brims with warmth, compassion and a kindrance of wounded souls - that is starkly poignant. <br />So much so that it makes you forgive the uneven pacing and the lack of sub-characters in her novel.

Her latest romance thriller Into The Night sees Ms. Brockmann's groundbreaking effort in tying romance with terrorism - a topic which has gained currency with the unraveling of Al Qaeda network. <br />Which is all very refreshing except Ms. Brockmann chooses to stay rooted to the romance aspect - and the suspense element comes in intermittently when Husaam - a terrorist with the Al Qaeda network plans to assassinate President Byrant during his visit to a Californian naval base. He uses disillusioned Mary Lou, wife of Sam Starrett, a Navy SEAL as an unwitting pawn in his plans. <br />This novel is thus essentially romance and its strength bolsters on the compelling human drama and three intertwined complexed love stories. Joan DaCosta, public relations for the  White House falls for the much younger Lt. Jr Mike Muldoon against her judgement. Joan's grandfather Vince  strives to match Charlotte's enshrined first husband who died a hero in love. Sam Starrett's relationship with Mary Lou turns awry when the latter traps him into marriage with a pregnancy. <br />There is sizzle and vulgar humor and Ms. Brockmann's characterization comes out as sincere as her admiration for the SEAL. It is also commendable that she does not stereotype the Muslims with her portrayal of gentle Ihbraham as a close friend of Mary Lou. Of the three stories, her secondary WWII romance with Charlie and Vince comes out tenderly poignant and evocative as Vince thinks he is fighting a dead man for Charlie's heart. Joan and Mike's age-gap proves an interesting dilemma but unable to stop their wondrous chemistry and hearty humor from getting the best of them. <br />Therefore, Into the Night unlike the adventures in Out of control is a straight romance aimed to salute the courageous SEALs. It is consistently readable and riveting but her immense admiration sometimes erroneously creates a romanticized version of SEAL as alpha male. It is only up to her tragic character Sam Starrett with his choice of honor over love that jolts us back to the fact that - they are after all men and not saints.	2002-12-09

She departs hastily with her companion, Ms. Pickens in a barouche to London with a furious storm brewing and heads to the inn to get a travelling carriage. It is coincidental she meets Adam Harleston, ninth earl of Drakesley who has been promised the carriage. Lilah is compelled to share the carriage with the overbearing Drake in her state of urgency and discovers later that Drake is actually going to London to find her father's intended Eugenia to propose. With a twist of fate, the two of them strikes an alliance to separate the lovers only to find themselves falling for each other....<br />Who can ever imagine a scenario like a carriage ride would be such a theatrical pleasure? Diane Farr creates palpable chemistry between Lilah and Drake with catty sexist barbs, duelling of wits and intelligence that makes this romp a lively and crackling revue from start to finish. Their exchange is quick and with such hostility yet affection that readers will know this oddball couple is destined for each other. Ms. Farr's characters grows on you with their quirky characters and banishes the damsel-in-distress-alpha-male stereotype with their rebellious self. <br />It is laugh-a-loud hysterics when Lilah finds herself falling for Drake and sees the irony of her separating Eugenia and her father. The stubborn hearts refuses to submit - and so enters the ensemble of memorable side-characters like the concerned Aunt Polly and Uncle Nat as well as the wise Eugenia playing matchmakers. <br />Ms. Farr has outdone herself this time when the humor comes out fast and furious in the duel of hearts and wits. The passion between Lilah and Drake is tenderly sexy and poignant without the usual open-the-bedroom style in romance novels nowadays. This rip-roaring romantic comedy bolsters on the strength dynamic duo to deliver a joyouscomical celebration of bliss and love. How I just love them when they are in love and war.	2002-12-07

Her seamstress for her bridal trousseau Mary Marsh seems to hold secrets to her death - and the devastated brother of the deceased Marcus has come back from Egypt to investigate the real reason of her death.  <br />It becomes all too obvious that Mary and Marcus are going to fall in love with their progressive admiration; the viscount whom Christine is intended for is a scoundrel and that Mary is a bourgeois unsuitable for the earl. It is Ms. Ashworth's intention to focus on the central characters and simply neglects the sub-characters. It's not a who-dun-it nor a noir but simply a strait-laced romance. However even the romance has failings. Ms. Ashworth lacks her usual empathy for her characters as she charts their emotions and instead injects an overdose of melodrama. <br />Harsh the review may be but for a former RITA winner of outstanding talents to be delivering such standard fare, her faithful readers are most disappointed as I am. We are not asking for perfection here but this read is simply way off the scale with its uninspired plot.	2002-12-03

No way can Ms. Alessandro repeat the wondrous surprise in her debut Red Roses Means Love nor the rambunctious assemble of sub-characters in The Bridal Thief, but this romance definitely charms with effervescent chemistry from the leading duo. <br />Widow Alberta Brown travels to America to visit her pregnant friend Elizabeth and the voyage is a harrowing one - considering an attempt on her life aboard. Her enamoured escort Robert Jamison is astounded by the vitality concealed by her grim exterior and mourning dress. Not surprising though - Allie's deceased husband David was killed in a duel by his lover's husband and his diary exposed his betraying and treacherous side. To preserve her diginity Allie intends to return all the things he had stolen including a ring with a coat-of-arm that has unwittingly landed Robert and her in a precarious situation....<br />As with all Ms. Alessandro's romance, the hero Robert is devastatingly gallant and honorable with a secret of his past misdeed; the heroine Allie is intelligent, witty but scarred by love and saddened by her infertility. However the element that is new and improved here is definitely the more sensual tone of their passion that sizzles with chemistry and not prurience. <br />Whirlwind Affair is at once schmaltzy and whimisical - a joyous celebration of friendship, new hopes and abiding love that is sparkingly magical and simultaneously guilty escapism as we are already swept away in conjugal bliss.	2002-11-26

Her earlier foray into romance suspense distinguishes her as one of the few who churns out jugular action and gorgeous romance - and Keeper Of The Bride displays her punchy, knockout style within a laconic 250 pages. <br />ER nurse Nina Cormier not only had her wedding plans bombed when her intended hooked up with another woman, and narrowly escaped a planned bombing. Was it a deliberate attempt on her life or one of the guests in her wedding? Why did the characteristics of the bombing point to the work of dead terrorist Spectre? Sam Narvarro, the Portland detective is determined to root out the perpetrator but passion gets in the way of his obligations. Danger arises when Nina and Sam is thrown together in the mad schemes of a vengeful bomber...<br />Keeper of the Bride may have a cliche plot but maestro Gerritsen moves the story swiftly and gives her characters dimension with insecurities and sincerity. It is a mystery wrapped with treachery and cutting suspense right up to the explosive climax - and with Ms. Gerritsen's background as a physician, forensic evidence flows along to give credibility to the plot.

Ellis Cooper gets incarcerated in Central Prison, North Carolina and charged with the murder of three women. The trio of scot-free perpetrators acting upon the orders of a mysterious mastermind, meanwhile commit serial killings across the States, leaving clues that pinpoint to a Vietnam War operation. The red-tapes of army bureaucracy and the nightmarish revival of Kyle Craig as well as Cross's love-path and family offers interesting diversions to the fast-paced, punchy mystery with twists and turns. As always the tone of this Patterson's story is dark with themes of vendetta and even terrorism but what is new and improved here is more solid character development from Patterson. With his usual style of relentless suspense, this is a harrowing cat-and mouse game with not three but four mice on the loose.	2002-11-22

This time round is no different except that Getting Her Man sees her associated with a theme she is most familiar with - archaelogy.<br />With a nifty grip on her subject, Ms. Albert deftly intertwines the theft of priceless artefacts and steers the story somewhat resembling The Thomas Crown Affair with an intelligent private investigator Diana Belmaine hunting for the bold kleptomaniac except that things get a whole lot complicated when the prime suspect is the devastatingly gorgeous bachelor Dr. Jack Austin in this cat-and-mouse game. Diana is hired by rich socialite Carmichael to recover his stolen Egyptian collection of the pharoah Tutankhamen regime and Jack is coincidentally an archaeologist sponsored by him. <br />Since it is a romance, it is predictible that Jack ends up stealing Diana's heart but what is unexpected is Ms. Albert's evocative characterization that provides them dimension and engages us to dig in deeper for the mystery and their wondrous chemistry. Ms. Albert weaves the intense seduction through smoldering dialogues and passion; wraps us in unfettered romance and warmth when both of the betrayed souls seeks comfort in one another. It is rollicking fun with the dynamic duo exchanging catty barbs and outwitting one another, leaving us convinced that these two are really committed and totally in love. <br />And not many romances can accomplish that with an emotional sincerity that is exclusively found in the honorable and passionate Jack as well as the pragmatic Diana. This read is classic escapist fun at its best which also succeeds in being sexy, smart and sassy. So while Diana is getting her man, both of them are bent on stealing our hearts as well.	2002-11-21

Her last effort Secret of the Wolf is a riveting tale of lycanthropes in hypnotic realms and this time round, she fuses beautifully Irish mythic forest lords into her Regency.<br />Sic years ago, Lady Eden Fleming fleds marriage to cousin Cornelius Fleming after overhearing the conversation with her father and him. He is in fact Hern - The Forest Lord who has struck a bargain with her father for the custody of her coming child, acting upon orders from the Queen to sire a half-human child to extend their weakening bloodline. Lord Bradwell has unfortunately injured a stag in a hunting game where it was a manifestation of Hern and is coerced to his biddings. <br />Eden's present husband Winstowe is dead and reveals to her that her son is actually alive. She travels back to Hartsmere with her manipulative aunt Claire and meets an unlikely savior of her son Donal. The enigmatic Hartley Shaw is actually Hern in disguise after he learns that Donal is alive. He plans to snatch his son back but never did he expect his attraction to Eden has deepened. A chance of love materializes but Claire is determined to protect Eden at all cost including destroying the forest lord with the cursed iron arrows.<br />The Forest Lord sees Ms. Krinard at the peak of characterization and romance crafting through Eden's strength and transformation from a betrayed woman to a courageous mother with much love and a passionate lover. Hern is no standard alpha male either; he too is confused by familial ties and the mutations of love conflicting with his obligations. Even the villain isn't stereotypical fare. Claire's protection for Eden stems from a personal tragedy which spurred her hatred for Hern.<br />It is a great romance which both main protagonists mature and sacrifice; it is a story of great intrigue and human drama with the treachery of Claire. Yet it is alsoa fairy-tale with the magical realms of Irish folklore but carries resonant ecological message at Ms. Krinard's most imaginative spin.  The tale is thus complexed and textured to defy categorization. It is unique just like her plot and her mastery of descriptions and atmosphere. She is truly, in a class of her own with the enchanting Forest Lord.	2002-11-17

Like the cynical and sardonic heroine Cannie, the imperfections are all forgiven when it departs from the mainstream chick literature with a huge dose of wits and heart. Jennifer Weiner in her  auspicious debut exposes the insecurity of an obese woman struggling to come to terms with her awry love-life when Cannie's ex Bruce Guberman enlightens the public with a magazine column on Loving a larger woman. <br />Good in Bed keeps the self-effacing humour rolling in with Cannie's self-evaluation and scurrilous insults towards diet programs yet it is at its best when personal moments such as Cannie's familial hell and apathetic father churn out poignancy and sympathy for our protagonist. The prose is snappy and fast; the plot is believable until her incredulous encounter with famed actress Maxi Ryder who offers her solace and a glamour trip to Hollywood for the Philadephia Examiner reporter.<br />It is guilty of being shamelessly melodramatic as Cannie broaches motherhood and artfully contrived with a fairy-tale oddball romance. It is with flaws, no doubt - but aren't we guilty of criticizing a feel-good novel with positive message like the shallow discrimination of pinpointing a woman's weight and forgetting her merits? Furthermore it's Weiner's debut and her tactic of skirting a weighty issue with souffle-light humour poses an irresistible temptation. Dig in and enjoy.	2002-11-15

Both features twins of polarized nature and switches identity to mislead their love-interest. <br />However To Die For is distinctly darker and more sexually oriented materials with its theme on voyeurism and S/M normally eschewed by romances. Abby St. James embarks on a stint stipulated by her deceased father in a codicil and takes the helm from the domineering, wilful Micky to supervise Bastion, a leading Magazine pioneered by their father. She meets sexy Italian hunk Stefan Messari and finds herself attracted as both shares their dark secrets. Abby decides to abandon all for a night of passion with Stefan, knowing that her days are numbered with an illness. Yet the greater danger lies in a sadistic and deranged psychopath threatening Abby's sanity when he assumes Abby is Michaela....<br />Even with its taboo topics and intermittent suspense, To Die For is actually a melodramatic tearjerker that will have you emptying out Kleenex - and unabashedly drives our cynicism aside with the saintly noble Abby forfeiting her chance of love because of her illness and sterility while the brooding Stefan is her knight in shining armour. Can't stand the mush? Then why in the first place are you doing here in romance genre? Ms. George again delights us with a read of sheer escapism and gooey-eyed, melting romance with searing passion. It's one hard-core addicts of romance would die for but pragmatists would gladly avoid.	2002-11-14

The Usual Suspects prop out with hidden motives. Sounds like The Maltese Falcon with Sam Spade and Bridget O' Shaughnessy? In fact What the Lady Wants by Jennifer Crusie is an irreverently funny parody of the genre with plenty of wits and romance. <br />Sassy Mae Sullivan has approached Mitch Peatwick to find the murderer and a missing diary is the key. As a man \\"who needed professional weepers for his funeral\\", Armand Lewis is a prime target on everybody's hate-list. Could the butler Harold and June silence the self-centred Armand for his wealth? Or could it be the deceptively innocent Mae (think Bridget) who seems more concerned to find the diary and shows bitterness for her uncle who stole her trust fund? What about his brother Claud and mafia-boss Gio Donatello who held personal grudges?<br />You can mull over the who-dun-it but we are more likely to indulge in the catty barbs exchanged by Mitch and Mae. The sexist remarks like Open the West, deadpanned humour and sparkling romance provides the guilty pleasure. Crusie's tone is cynical - and like in the mystery everybody lies and that's where the delicate trust between Mitch and Mae comes out surprisingly poignant.The side characters like Donatello, June and Harold are delightfully comedic with clever quips and wild gesticulations. Add on to a love rival cousin Carlos who is fond of vandalism - you can see their love path isn't all smooth. <br />Crusie mixes the reassuringly good old fun stuff to give a read of sheer escapism and wicked humour. Infantile jokes like broken condoms and the absurd bullet-shoot out are good-naturedly slapstick and how I laughed at Mitch's eventful encounter to Mae's house for a night of passion. This lady certainly knows how to shoot a barrel of laughter and trigger romance sparks with a smokin' pen.	2002-11-11

This book lives up to its reputation of being indulgently bad, heart-brakingly sexy and darkly dangerous. <br />Then why not a five-star review for their concerted effort? Of the three entries, Janelle Denison's story Something Wilde is discerningly the best because of her outstanding male protagonist Eric Wilde who gives room for freelance co-worker Jill Richardson to breathe, respects her opinion as to her partnership with the firm rather than corner her. That - in my view is a subtler display of passion and being sexy; their erotic coupling are fuelled by wild fantasy of reckless blindfold and pearls - yet never on par with the intensity of the romantic moment when Jill risks it all for love.<br />That is not to say Shannon McKenna or Lori Foster isn't good. In fact Ms. McKenna's sexual scenes are exquisitely burning with raw emotions between massage therapist Tess Langley and rich businessman Jonah Markham but sometimes the marathon becomes overly gratituous. Their attraction is fierce and intense - enough to make Tess cower because she fears Jonah will conform her to a mold like her parents and her ex. The initial manhandling by Jonah may be disapproved by some romance fans but as the story unfolds, Ms. McKenna softens him into a kind of protectiveness rather than obsession that makes him endearing. <br />Lori Foster's hero Ian Conrad is equally intrusive when he sets his sight on conquering the sassy and fiercely independent Erica Lee albeit of a lesser intensity than Jonah. Fans will rejoice with the comeback of her past characters in a reunion - Asia, Becky, Cameron and George. Yet while huge as he is, ahem, physically speaking and distant, Erica is charmed by the honorable and virile Ian. The sex scenes are sparkling yet ironicallyless bold considering the bondage and spanking themes in her last efforts and Erica is the most outspoken of the three.<br />Who will ever complain a book with loads of sensual pleasures? However when it comes to this insanely talented three, I was looking for a little bit extra - and Ms. Denison's story clinched my thumbs-up. Her hero just literally stopped my heart with his graciousness. Who ever says manners don't count?	2002-11-10

Most fanatics of such genre would agree that the classic by Jude Deveraux A Knight in Shining Armour reigns incomparable. That is until Karen Marie Moning releases her latest The Dark Highlander to be a worthy contender.<br />This is by far Ms. Moning's most complexed time-travel with its subversively darker tone and beautifully researched materials on Irish myths and historical tapestries - converging on the magical realms of Druids and a superior fairy-race Tuatha De Danaan. While the fairies indoctrinate the Druids on flourishing their civilization with science, 13 druids became avaricious and desired immortality like their otherworldly counterparts. The fairy imprisons them as dark souls trapped in the Stones - a time portal forbidden to humans and the chosen MacKeltars who guard them. Daegus, a 16th century Highlander in an attempt to rescue his twin brother, goes back in time to save him but ends up manipulated by the dark souls gradually.     <br />He is thrown to the modern times - and voraciously reads up the scripts relevant to removing the curse. Earthy and sassy curator Chloe Zander delivers a sacred book and accidentally stumbles upon his identity as the Gaulish Ghost - a moniker for the thief of Celtic relics. Dageus bounds Chloe as his mate and together they search for his panacea, with descendents of the evil Druids on their heels....<br />Ms. Moning cleverly eschews from bombarding the reader and inserts her materials aptly. Her prose is snappy, fast and instead focuses on the characterization to accentuate the loyalty of Dageus and the saucy Chloe. Their effervescent sexual chemistry zings through the page and offers a respite from the frenetic pace of their rollicking adventure. <br />With so many developments at hand, it is all the more laudable that Ms. Moning, a former RITA winner strings them up coherently with her usual sleight-of-hand into an essential battle of overcoming odds with love. Ofcourse Ms. Moning is deft after writing so many time-travel romance, but this passage through time is zippy, gleefully fun and darkly intriguing to give the best joyride I have experienced this year.	2002-11-08

Unconventional? Yes - and in fact Lynn Kurland's latest medieval romp banishes the rote alpha-male formula to craft out Colin the butcher of Berkhamshire - a gruff grizzly warrior who dislikes bathing and the chains of matrimony. Even Alienore of Solonge, his intended has decided to fled at the thought of being married to the fearsome warrior and disguise as a knight Henri to hide from the radar of her malicious stepmother Marie. A twist of fate sends her to Blackmour where her charge Sybil is promised to her intended and the farce stretches thinner with the closer proximity of Colin who decides to train her in swordplay. The villian Sir Etienne accidentally overheard her admittance and decides to threaten her....<br />It is true that the story stretches too long yet the cross-dressing farce of a romance sustains interest with the dynamics of the couple. The innocent chaste romance draws on the strength of the two beguiling characters where it grows from admiration to trusting love - and that both of them shows surprising dimensions. Alienore matures from her cowardice; Colin has a tender chivalrous heart despite his unappealing appearance. It is refreshingly funny and poignant with quirky flawed protagonists in this starkly fractured romance. <br />This isn't Ms. Kurland's best of course - what with stereotypical villains and overdevelopment at some parts of the story like Henri's training. Yet it is a sparkling original even though it is uneven at parts - and why not accept these flaws as we come to accept the deviant protagonists?	2002-11-07

Yet it seems that while love is blossoming between the love-struck couple, shadows of paranoia begins to surface. Was Del involved in the execution of the robbery as one of the robbers Glasgow accused? If not how did Glasgow know intimate details of Del and Mick?The intrigue and mystery serves as a sideline to the sexy romance yet it comes none as fascinating to the reunion of characters from her past novels. Alec and Celia, Dane and Angel with Mick's staunch buddies Josh and Zane play cupid to the golden couple who are thrust into a web of mistrust and lies. It is lightweight romance with a tortured hero and a feisty, risk-daring heroine but also a sheer explosion of bliss with these quirky fun characters - so get caught in the read.	2002-11-07

The first chapter begins with an agonizingly disturbing account of the fourteen-year old Susie Salmon who was brutally raped and murdered by schzoid neighbor Mr. Harvey and later proceeds on to telling how her family has disintegrated with the impact of the murder. Her father suffers a depression from pursuing her daughter's death; her mother retreats and ends up having an affair; her tragic siblings Lindsey struggles with her loss and Buckley gripping with filling the hole in the family.<br />Yet familial hell isn't what makes The Lovely Bones sensational. It is Sebold's child-like narration that renders the book poignant with lost innocence and her mastery at revitalizing the readers' senses with vivid descriptions of smell and Heaven. She uses objects like a monopoly game and bottleships to tacitly echo out the character's interplay of emotions - and expressing effectively their grief. The family matures and connects like the bones, becoming stronger and gives us a renewed sense of faith and understanding as to why each family member errs. I empathize with Abigail's merciful adultery and how Jack has overlooked his daughter Lindsey in his frantic search for Susie.  <br />What's a little sentimentalism when the book is emotionally honest? A good book rewards a reader with insight and experience - and The Lovely Bones achingly underscores the importance of letting go one's grief to focus on the better things of life. This message cannot be more timely or resonant in this era of chaos.	2002-11-01

The three tales of passion reigns with romance of a dangerous slant in archetypal alpha-male protagonist. <br />Lake of Dreams, the first feature that tells of house-painter Thea plagued by phantasm of a lover in another time is surreal but charged with feverish chemistry. She meets the man up,close and personal with a trip to her cherished summerhouse but when passion overrules her rationale - her dreams warned of a past betrayal elicited from the man she loves.  <br />Blue Moon, the second tale delves into the supernatural with an unexpected romance between Arkansas Sheriff Jackson Brody and a recluse Delilah Jones who is rumoured to be a sorceress. Stranded at her home when he is called upon to ward off a gun-toting trespasser, they share a stormy night of magical passion that is full of promise. <br />White Out, the third and best out of the three matches pulsating suspense with quicksilver desire. Lonely holiday inn operator Hope Bradshaw rescues a stranger from the devastating snowstorm in Idaho but could end up losing her life and love when she suspects him to be one of the convicts that escaped. <br />The hardcover edition that debuted earlier this year may not have equate the price with the quantity of reissued materials. The release of this paperback will prove a more convincing justification to grab Ms. Howard's book - fast.	2002-10-30

In fact in Shannon McKenna's debut full-length erotic romance novel, the untainted pair are saints compared to the miscreants.<br />One by which is Raine's uncle Victor Lazar, multimillionaire businessman who harbors a mad passion for collecting murdering weapons from the past. His latest whim takes him to threatening his associate Kurt Novak with a video-clip flashing his heinous murder of a model and his lover and his murder weapon. Novak is also responsible for the death of undercover agent Jesse Cahill, Seth Mackey's brother and thanks to his surveillance expertise, he is able to infiltrate Lazar's corporation as an employed surveillance expert to catch him and Novak red-handed with the help of his allies, the McCloud brothers.<br />Mistaking Raine as Lazar's mistress, he keeps close tabs on her and the detection edges close to an obsession for voyeurism. Behind Closed Doors he engages in his private fantasy until he meets her in person - and Raine is caught up in a web of sensual passion and animal attraction. <br />Think the book is sleazy with sex? Absolutely not when Ms. McKenna's passion strips bare her characters' insecurities and vulnerabilites with tragic intimacy. Raine is haunted by dreams the past seventeen years of her father's death; Seth loses the sole kin who offers him love in a cynical environment controlled by his abusive father. It is sensuous erotic passion that shines over the clinical and perverse carnal acts between Lazar and his secretary. Raine and Seth engages in a fierce battle of power-play through sexual connection, offering a refuge for them built with quiet love, isolation and protection. <br />Ms. McKenna's characters are brutally honest like her overt passionate scenes - and this is what makes them strongly evocative and endearing. It is not a fairy-tale, bed-of-roses romance but a powerful love starkly devastating in its scale through the mistrust, dangerous obsession, voyeurism and frenetic pursuits from Novak's cronies to capture Raine. <br />There is absorbing and jolting suspense, surveillance research and familial hell in the story. Yet all these is secondary to the tender and poignant love scenes between the oddball couple. Each passionate play is lusciously sexy and steamy - only because of the emotional undercurrents. It is thus advisable to read it behind closed doors - for the erotic scenes sizzle and fog the mirror.	2002-10-30

The characters are thankfully colourful and shrewd especially the women. Alex, a bohemian at nature charms with steely independence to restore the fortunes of her languished estate. She ventures into the underbelly of seedy London, writes mordant political criticism and undertakes scandalous posing for debauched gentleman's bar. The strong female traits are also found in Dottie, her grandmother while the male gender takes a backseat with Rupert her brother unconsciously cuckolded by Kit and the unrepentant wastrel deep in alcohol and gambling. Nicholas and Alex represent the untainted protagonists in the treacherous English ton of betrayal and their love shines in the bleakness of their milieu. They equal each other in spirits and wits.<br />Ravished certainly lacks the former indulgence of romance and passion evident in her classic Desired and Enslaved but compensates with a solid and unexpected ending of mixed identity and an unconventional cunning heroine. Though the passion in Ravished emerges relatively tamed to her previous books, there are certainly parts of her style that readers will no doubt relish.	2002-10-27

The playful mood of seduction wears thin to obscure the lack of atmosphere and depth in the lengthy read. Even Ms. Smith's passionate scenes fail to elicit the spark and chemistry between the characters who repeatedly falls out and reunites with sex in some sort of a vicious cycle. To add a dollop of intrigue and danger, Ms. Smith throws in a rival gambling operator who threatens her business and sends Lillith desperate for Gabe's protection. Ms. Smith redeems with a rousing ending to build up and impress with the altruistic Lillith and the gallant Gabe in their love for each other with obstacles of class and the demise of Gabe's father but it seems that Ms. Smith is only to content with a palatable plot to string the lovers together without much thought for the milieu and plot structure. This book thus languishes into a fleeting pleasure that fails to stimulate the heart and the intellect. Detractors may argue that it's an archetypal romance but a little more effort in detailing the historical period is deeply appreciated - and definitely worth the gamble.	2002-10-26

There lies the conflict of half Saxon-half Norman Aimery de Gaillard who pledges fealty to William but acknowledges his fraternity with English rebel Hereward. Aimery is torn between loyalty when he secretly and unwittingly helps the English populace as his disguised alter-ego Golden Hart battle injustices inflicted by powerful Norman landlords like Madeline de la Haute Vironge's uncle who rules Badderley with tyranny.<br />Madeline has to wed a lord to remove her uncle from her estate - and with a twist of fate she ends up choosing Aimery. Yet trust eludes them when Madeline fears that Aimery is a treasonous traitor and Aimery grips with rumors of Madeline's cruel facade behind her beguiling innocence. <br />Rich with historical details and majestic in its scope of war, betrayal and treachery, Lord Of My Heart sweeps the readers away with the period and embellishes it with a heartfelt romance that sparkles with wits and sensual delights. The clash of honours, familial ties and love evoke a powerful drama to rival the ferocious intensity of the swashbuckling extravaganza.	2002-10-24

Her love-interest Adam is shattered by the confusion induced by his kidnap and the mysterious death of his parents. Always a lone-child, he seeks unexpected companionship in Darci. <br />Even if the far-fetched ending seems incredulous and rushed, the journey to there is a refreshing adventure with the oddball couple's whimsical chemistry that blends in with the alchemy to wield practical magic.	2002-10-16

Nicole Ballard haunted by the emotional scars and label as frigid by her ex, relives her humiliation when Chase Wilcox, a volcano expert and misoygnst thinks her brazen to break his brother's marriage attempts to seduce her and pour cold water.

He thinks his son a traitor and leads Robert's brothers to a scheme that went awry. Lady Judith and Mairi are captured at the expense of his brothers' lives and thus the recipents of his frustrations. <br />Yet Lady Judith is surprisingly clear-headed and virtuous, and equally as fiery and passionate to summon Rob's ineffable attraction. When the Lochawe populace and his father Angus suspects that Lady Judith practises witchery, Robert is spurred to rescue her to Glenlyon and secures her to a handfasting marriage to keep her safe.<br />The romance blossoms in the midst of the throes of war between Bruce the COnqueror and King Edward. Told with painstaking historical details, the fable becomes grippingly real with the robust battles and political machinations. The highland romance is atmopherically structured with clan clashes and raid as well as treasonous enemies who threaten the transcient happiness of Judith and Rob. Ms. Garnett weaves her sterling characters in dilemmas to explore their strengths. Lady Judith is courageous to defy her destiny and Rob is hardened by betrayal and later softened by her love. They compliment each other in passion as well as wits. <br />The Laird is as authentic as it gets and is a vicarious visit to premordial Scotland. Even the language Ms. Garnett uses is thickened with Scottish brogue. The Laird is a splendid account of fiction and true historical tableau, complete with smoldering passion and memorable characters that will grow on you like fine Scottish ale.	2002-10-13

Lori Foster casts brilliant alchemy with primed sexual awareness, witty banters and the clash of characters between the oddball couple that is ineffably magical and irresistible.<br />And who can resist the sensitive Ben with \\"bad\\" eponymous in his name? His protective streak summons all the melting gallantry and he actually cooks for Sierra, rescues her from the storm even despite her resistance to accept his gracious efforts. Sierra actually rejects him and is determined to carve a niche for herself. Her beguiling innocence and endearingly stubborn character belies a vulnerable heart from  spousal abuse in her previous marriage.    <br />While Too Much Temptation banks on sexual dominion, Never too Much is mellowed and subtler with the relationship built on mutual sharing and a pervasive sense of care and concern. This is, au contraire, much sexier and intimate passion with Ms. Foster's smoldering lush prose. There is heart and poignancy as the complicated relationship between termagent granny Agatha Harper and Ben unfolds, the fraternity between Noah, Grace and Ben glows while Kent Monroe and Ben's mother develop the hots for each other. <br />With such a heartening and textured story with much sizzles and evocative characters, it is always never too much.

The answer can be found in her maiden novel of romantic suspsense published in 1989 and now re-issued as an Avon classic romance in a stylish, slick repackage.<br />If you expect a frenetically-paced thriller, you are in for a double disappointment because Ms. Andersen sluggishly tugs the predictible murder sans who-dun-it with rhetoric crime procedurals and listing of the usual suspects. The uninspired plot of Seattle detective Tristan McLaughlin transferred to Reno embarking on a serial-killer trail secrets little surprises. There is the routine scares and threats for virginal dancer Amanda Rose whom he is assigned to protect - and she becomes his love-interest as obligations and feelings interweaves.<br />Perhaps the only savoury element is the romance with Ms. Andersen spending much time in character development. Orphaned solitary Tristan hides beneath his shield a reserve of emotions while Amanda haunted by the death of her sister, sets expectations she is unable to achieve and is self-deprecating in nature. Ms. Andersen shows much-needed maturity towards the end in her narration on Amanda's psychological traumas and self-imposed barriers.<br />So is this supposed to be a thriller or archetypal romance? The problem is Ms. Andersen cannot decide. In-depth characterization becomes overly extraneous to the suspense and the melancholia of overwrought drama unfortunately overshadows the featured murder and erases its grit and panache to end with a slow dance.	2002-10-10

His enigmatic  presence is unwelcomed by Stonegate Inn owner sans neigbor Sophie Davis. Disconcerted by her sister's pubescent attraction to the man, she fears John will lead her astray. Even her crime novel addict of a mother has been steeped in illusions since his arrival, accusing him of being the frightful serial killer that terrorized New England two decades ago.<br />Anne Stuart's murder-...-mayhem novel explores the deranged and the nihilistic as in her past suspense thrillers such as Moonrise. However the omnipresence of danger and erotic edges saturated in her earlier works falters here probably because of the unsatisfying length and a too predictible who-dun-it. What is unique about Ms. Stuart's romantic suspense though is her thoroughly unconventional protagonist who realistically emerges from our humdrum lives. Sophie isn't all glamor; she juggles with a crumbling dysfunctional family and a job as the poor woman's Martha Stewart and worries about assimilated calories because she is on the plump side. Her hero Thomas is dark, shadowy and even sinister with a complex that borders on danger. This oddball couple adds depth and smoldering sexual chemistry to this otherwise mediocre effort from Ms. Stuart.	2002-10-10

The fourth installment, The Ecstasy sees her revert to a more down-to-earth plotline without the frills of espionage somewhat parallel to The Seduction.<br />Except it's subversively darker in tone. Fans of Ms. Jordan will remember Lady Vanessa expiating for the mistakes of her brother in The Seduction. Ths time round it is the egregious gamester Kell Lasseter who atones for his brother Sean when he abducts the beautiful Raven Kendrick on her nuptial day with the Duke of Halford by proposing a marriage of convenience. <br />The trio of characters are heartbreaking creatures. Victimized by his paedophilic uncle, Sean Lasseter turns deranged and vindictive towards his brother Kell for failing to rescue him.  Kell Lasseter blames himself for his brother's plight and connive at his misdeeds but when a lady's honour is ruined by his brother's hands and that Sean may be incarcerated for the kidnap, he offers Raven his protection even as he feels contempt for the English prigs who harshly discriminated against his mother of Irish origins and left her to languish in poverty. Raven is disillusioned with her mother's tragic death in her quest for grand passion which was never requited. Her mother made her promise to marry for good station and not love. She represses her passion by conjuring up a dream-lover and is afraid to love. Haunted by her stepfather's label as a bastard, she buries her past in the Caribbean to search for acceptance in London. <br />A simple story allows the full rein of character development. Ms. Jordan blends her fusion of poignant romance and searing passion seamlessly like that of The Seduction. The love scenes seeth with erotic virtuoso from the genesis of Raven's imaginary pirate lover and Kell's determination to realize the fantasy. Their relationship blooms from sexual chemistry to admiration and ulitmately trust. Raven finds Kell's chivalry and honor - as well as his care for orphans which stems from his tortured past worthy of emulation. Kell is fascinated by Raven's uniqueness in her tart and sass and strong display of affection for him despite her feigned nonchalance. <br />The impassioned couple has a love so sincere and strong that it will make you weep through the lacerating epilogue. Ms. Jordan crafts the characters with a scherzo of emotions that leaves none of them caricatured. The villain Sean earns equal sympathy and hatred; Raven's grandfather relents with forgiveness for repudiating his daughter. Though the love scenes are delightfully scorching and an abundance of indulgence, it is ulimately the couple's enlightenment and triumph over adversity that renders Ms. Jordan's romance as this year's most ecstatic experience. Forget the euphoria from Ecstasy pills. This is pleasure of the highest order.	2002-10-07

If not why would her latest paranormal romance which is a smashing smorgasbord of Buffy-the-vampire slayer episodes, Anne Rice's Lestat tales and Greek myths and allegory be of such sprawling imagination and consistency? <br />Raised in a family that matches the eccentricity of Addams enough to scare her clerk boyfriend Cliff away, uptight Amanda Deveraux stymies her psyhic powers to preserve a shred of normalcy. A trip to her vampire-exorcist sister Tabihita's home turns pivotal as she is knocked unconscious and ends up handcuffed to gorgeous hunk Kyrian of Thrace, the brooding Dark-hunter embarking on a mission to slay the powerful Daimon Desiderius who snatches the souls of human to survive their mortality of 27 years. <br />It is amazing how Ms. Kenyon integrates Greek mythology with the tale. She brings in Julius from Fantasy Lovers to explain Zeus and progenitor Apollo in their indirect connection to the birth of Apollites and how its creator curses them to become treacherous Daimon who is bent on the destruction of human.  <br />Kyrian is one of the wretched souls who embarks on the road to perdition with the betrayal of his infidel of a wife Theone.  He is scarred emotionally and physically from love - and Amanda who is moved by his giving spirits and chivalrous soul - becomes the unexpected healer with her undying love. Their romance is equal parts heart-searing and schmaltzy with emotions and chemistry.<br />Ms. Kenyon's paranormal romance is a marvel with its ensemble of colourful and quirky characters especially that of the comically larcenous squire Nick, the enigmatic compatriots Talon and Acheron and of course the exuberant Deveraux family as well as the sagely Aphrodite, Julius and Grace. Even the villain is nuanced with betrayals of his own. Right up to the twisting epilogue where Kyrian and Amanda finds a way to preserve their love and the ferocious jugular battle with the demon, it is exciting and gleefully wacky in high-styled flamboyance and mindless entertainment. Vampire-slaying has never been this cool or such a riotous sexy night pleasure.	2002-10-07

The collection of stories in this romantic anthology is sprawling in its imagination, rollicking fun and hopelessly quixotic at times. <br />Lynn Kurland hailed as one of the best romantic writers today weaves an unconventional tale of pageantry when Lianna of Grasleigh rouses the jealousy of the palace maidens when the chivalrous knight Kendrick of Artane associates with her. The ward of King Henry despite her blemished beauty finds solace with Jason of Artane - Kendrick's brother who is a notorious sorceror of dark arts. He rescues her from a poisoned death schemed by the maidens - and when Lianna uncxpectedly becomes the prize in a contest of valor between Kendrick and his spiteful cousin, the path to love becomes a tad complicated...<br />Madeline Hunter's tale evokes unexpected shades of honor and passion with a rich Venice merchant Andreas claiming back his lost love Giselle when she tries to sell him her cherished tapestry to rescue her debt-ladened brother. Karen Marie Moning tells a silly but entertaining tale of a romantic novelist who receives a tapestry and is transported to ancient Scotland to resuscitate the man of her destiny from 500 years of solitary confinement. <br />While the stories mentioned above are equal parts poignant and fantasy, none can match the imaginative Sherrilyn Kenyon in her colourful patchwork of Greek myths like Moirae of the Fates, lycanthrope and exciting time-travel. Historian Channing McRae has no idea that the tapestry she is studying on will bring her to Sebastian, descendent and former sentinel of the Arcadian - a population with human instincts but animal traits. The tapestry made by his demised sister he failed to protect will provide him a chance to rescue his brother and string him to his mate...<br />Tapestry is silky-smooth in its transition and the quartet of romance mavericks weave a common thread of passion and adventure. Quite possibly the most consistent anthology, this tapestry is of vintage quality and as fine as gossamer threads.	2002-10-04

The duel was sabotaged by a mysterious intruder who shot his opponent - and what was even more astounding was that his opponent was a female - identified later to be Miss Anne Neville. She had substituted Pankhurst to rescue her beloved friend from a brush with death. <br />Who could have wanted Miss Neville's life? Could it be her cousin Edwin who bears a seated grudge when she is the recipient of her uncle's fortune? Could it be the enigmatic Samuel Firth who had intended to shoot Joshua but ended up hitting the wrong target? Barbara Dawson Smith takes readers through a labyrinth of red herrings and paranoia as suspects surface with cloaked shenanigans. The mystery is intelligently plotted and cogently structured to deliver a rousing epilogue.<br />Even more stirring is the romance. Joshua and Anne complements beautifully in wits and intelligence as well as heart. As the veteran plagued with darkness, Joshua is determined to portect the innocence of Anne by maintaining his distance. Yet as danger approaches his desire to protect Anne stems from a deep yearning of wounded souls. The couple evokes an emotional gravitas that is searingly tender in the face of treacherous miscreants.<br />With a romance that is equally measured in the intensity of its mystery and mayhem, I gladly proclaim Ms. Smith a maverick tale-spinner- with all my heart.	2002-10-01

The stories featured on the two brothers - sinfully gorgeous hunk Gabe and the gentlemanly vet Jordan strums with light comical strokes and heartwarming romance. It is amazing how Ms. Foster can place mismatched pairs together and spark off effervescent sexual chemistry. The first story fixes up the uptight Elzabeth Parks with the extrovert Gabe when she does a thesis on heroism and is keen to do an interview with him. The second story is an oddball romance with single mother Georgia Barnes working as an exotic dancer who attracts Jordan with her maturity and generosity. This series is bubbly fun with the continuation of four brothers (Morgan and Sawyer in Once and Again) in their separate love lives and a celebration of their close-knitted fraternity. The boisterous family proves a source of joy and sheer bliss in this reissue - forever and always.	2002-09-28

Her idea for a toy creation is unscruplously stolen by a rival and she is dismissed from the company.<br />Reads like an ER script? Linda Francis Lee's transition from historical to contemporary plunges into a shaky start where the drama unfolds unabashedly melodramatic with sketchy side-characters like Jack's brother Hugh and her homosexual colleague Mark that sparks occasional banal laughs. The first half of the book is underdeveloped with Jack and Grace in an identity askance though the chemistry between the two is palpable with the alpha-male and damsel-in-distress situation that is out of platitude. <br />It wasn't till the second part that solved the enigma of the ravishing accolades heaped upon the book. Linda Francis Lee redeems herself as she juggles the dynamics of a family drama with sensitivity and light-hearted humour. The romance improves with Ruth's entrance who added the needed barbs to the tepid pace. She is the seven-year old sprite who comes under Grace's care after the demise of her father. Grace channels her energy to fighting the custody of the child and sheds her wimpish facade to prove to Jack she can carve a niche for herself and set things right through a thorny path. The family drama is poignant as each confronts his personal demons to stay united together in the face of adversity. <br />It was initially more fluff than stuff and certainly Linda Francis Lee's perilous fall from grace. However like her heroine despite her flaws, she finds strength and beautifully soars with renewed faith and grace. The romance is bittersweet and will leave a smile in its surprising triumph.	2002-09-28

In the 15th installment of the Death series, J.D Robb crafts a chilling techno-dystopia in 2059 where paedophiles and drug-traffickers are mysteriously victimized by a vigilantte operation to uphold justice. Their self-righteous mantra proclaims - absolute purity achieved. <br />It is up to edgy NYPSD Lieut. Eve Dallas to root out the perpetrators - as the virus exterminates their target but harms innocent by-standers including inflicting a near-fatal paralysis on e-cop McNab and took the life of an innocent sixteen-year old who is slashed by an infected pimp. The investigation grips her as she is apprehended by her past as an abused victim....<br />Purity in Death has the smarts and chutzpah with the fearless Dallas relentless in her pursuit for justice. J.D Robbs has honed her prose to razor-edged sharpness and accelerates the pacing to a frenzy one with grisly murders, political machinations up the social echelons and intrigues with provocative questions on morals and justice. It is dark and disturbing given the increasing number of computer-savvy felons sprouting at present who abuse and terrorize with the power of technology.<br />Clever characterization, swift dialogues and a wonderful supporting cast in the form of Eve's techno-whiz husband Roarke, her comically larcenous aide Peabody and the tenacious news-reporter Nadine makes this outing an eventful one for Robbs. Though her refreshing plot lacks the conviction to plunge in with more depth and moral complications, it nevertheless serves its purpose as a fast, jugular suspense thriller that oozes pure intelligence.<br />- Desmond CHan	2002-09-25

Evie who now steers the business after her aunt's elopement has a client who requested the use of Justin's ancestral abbey for her conjugal venue. She desperately needs this opportunity to prove herself to the public. Unknown to her, the sedate Justin with his guise as an ornithologist is a British spy who is instructed by his mentor Beverly to expect the arrival of a diabolical machine stolen from other countries. What both of them did not expect was a even greater hoax to make Justin the bait....<br />Amidst the deluge of romance novels today with similar espionage plot, Bridal Favors prominently stands out refreshingly with its well-executed twists. Yet what makes Bridal Favors such an explosion of sheer joy and bliss is Ms. Brockway's creation of a subdued and complexed hero with intellectuals and her charmingly vulnerable Evie who despite her average looks fascinates with her ingenuous mix of innocence and wits. The couple evokes tender feelings and chaste romance that has long faded away from the explicit romance nowadays we have come to expect.<br />This frothy enchanting tale under the magnificent ensemble of secondary characters like Lady Boughton, the fashion consultant Merry and the cantankerous Beverly is whimisical with Ms. Brockway's wry humour. Though some parts of the espionage plot comes out occasionally too clever for me to hook on, it is partly because I am swept away languorously by the oddball pair to their march up the altars.	2002-09-22

The challenges ahead are daunting - Samantha is not acclimatized to the bucolic countryside and certainly not to the masculine intractable presence of the regimental William Gregory. The children are mutinous with the loss of their mother to a robbery that William feels he is responsible for. She manages to straighten things in the dysfunctional family - and even persuaded William to open a ball which she had no idea that was an intricate plan of his to lure traitors to his den.....<br />My Favourite Bride has a perfunctory set-up that bears an uncanny resemblance to The Sound of Music with a twist of the espionage sub-plot and certainly undermined by similar but stronger romance offerings like An Affair to Remember by Karen Hawkins with a plot parallel to it. It is at best whimisical with a fairy-tale ephermeral lightness to it. Christina Dodd has perfected the chemistry between her characters - and this time round is no exception. Sam has sass to spare while William engages with his dark brooding side of an alpha male. The fraternity between the girls and Sam are affectionate; the romance frothy with wry humour and chaste innocence. Though not my favourite book from Christina Dodd, it is undoubtedly a slickly packaged romance that aims straight for your heart.	2002-09-21

For once the tantalizingly baiting prologue is actually an anonymous manuscript sent by recluse P.M.E at Georgia. It gets fortunately siphoned as a potential script by hot-shot editor Maris Matherly Reed - so much so that she is willing to travel from Manhattan to the remote island to groom the budding prodigy. This pivotal trip marks the beginning of a scheme by Parker Evans to seek vengeance and justice as the chapters unveil. Deception, betrayal and infidelity treacherously swarm into Maris's life and threatens her when she finds the enemy to be a breath away....<br />Sandra Brown started out as a romance writer and this time round she judiciously uses her talents for creating incendiary chemistry between her protagonists to good use. The dangerous romance between Maris and Parker simmers; the emotional development of the two complexed and dramatic. Being a writer also helps when the plot revolves around publishing and literary knowledge to fortify the credibility of the story. With some nifty twists and its frenetic pacing, Envy engages as a romantic suspense thriller and a heart-thumping foible on revenge and rivalry. As a bestselling author, her desire to make progress despite her much-to-be-envious-about achievements certainly left me impressed.	2002-09-15

Lori Foster spearheads with INDULGE ME picking up the story on innocent Becky Harte fulfilling a dare to venture into the scandalous porn shop in local Indiana. Mortification grips her when she meets her gorgeous supervisor George Westin - and erroneously thought her to develop a fetish for bondage. It is such riotous fun when the devilish George gets more than he bargains for and tender passion when Becky reveals her insecurities with the flaws on her body. Seasoned Harlequin writer Janelle Denison raises temperature with Naughty By Night - a simple tale about Gabe Mackenzie reclaiming his lost love through a poker card game that grants Chloe four nights of enslaved passion. Ms. Denison's idea of an erotic night is sparkingly romantic and original - and proves even watching a date movie with a loved one can be evocative in communication. Even Donna Kauffman cannot resist to stage a full-blown sexual escapade with distressed magnate Cameron James VI coming to a private resort dedicated to sensual pleasures and finds love in a remote island. The passionate play at the waterfall is sensuous and mystic; Ally and Cameron are two kindred spirits with heart and soul. I Love Bad Boys teases the senses with its risque theme on dangerous and virile men in their quest for love. It is wild, lush and deliciously sexy. Serves to remind us that sometimes being badder can be better.	2002-09-13

The new romance distinctively deviates from Ms. George's idiosynacratic style of simple wits and chaste passion. It is sensual and bold - but readers of her immensely popular Devil series can surely trust her to craft out a more intricate plot.<br />The Art of Seduction is strait-laced with a simple twist. Parris left a monogrammed handkerchief with the initial A.S that misled Dominick into thinking that he had compromised Annabelle's virtue. Despite his heart with Parris, he had to fulfil his honours to marry Annabelle - but upon witnessing the liaison between his brother and her, he calls it off and left for the Army. Eight years after he is back to London and meets up with Parris, he realizes his love for her remains strong. Things get complicated when Parris is Lady Scruples in disguise - the feminine crusader rescuing chaste debutantes from the clutches of profligates....<br />Melanie George's wits and humour may be subdued here but her consummate narration makes her latest a guilty pleasure. The passion between Dominick and Parris is sensual, erotic and electrifying to makes readers overlooking the simple story-line. She is focused in her writing and glosses the unrequited love with poignancy. Her emotional characters elevate this romance novel apart from the generic and makes The Art of Seduction ultimately gratifying.	2002-09-12

It revolves around erstwhile cello-ist Caroline Blessing who accompanies her mother Hilda to the exclusive Phoenix Spa at Virginia. When Claudia De Vries, owner of the spa dies brutally in a mud-bath, the shadows of paranoia emerges with suspicious characters lurking. King David - the famous rock star, Howard the director on a downslide, Ondine the waif-like model and her manager Lund with the psyhic Phyllis fill the list of possible suspects. Blackmailing, incest and subterfuges fuel the plot - and the consistent plot-line is such a hoot with the writers devilishly \\"back-stabbing\\" each other, leaving trails and clues for the next writer to continue in a logical path. The surprise ending is such a blast with Laurie King's sly wits and plot diversions. It gathers the patches of red herrings and sudden deaths into a logical puzzle. Fast, hilarious and melo-dramatic, Naked Came the Phoenix spreads infectious fun with the readers engaged in the twisty manoeuvres of the who-dun-it.	2002-09-10

This timely re-issue of Suzanne Brockmann's Prince Joe blends the heroics of SEALS with a scorching romance tinged with a fairy-tale charm. Ustanzian Prince Tedric on a diplomatic trip to America is being ambushed by an infamous terrorist organization The Cloud of Death. After a close brush with death, Prince Tedric resorts to finding a substitute with an uncanny resemblance in looks. He is SEALS Lieutenant Joe Catalanotto who previously rescued Tedric from an attack in Baghdad. Prince Tedric leaves the uphill task of transforming the coarse Joe to refined royalty to media consultant Veronica St. John. Saturated with chemistry and passion, Prince Joe shows Suzanne Brockmann at crafting top-notch romance with believable characters. Their polarized status and differences - not to mention the insecurity that Joe's occupation brings poses obstacle to their fragile relationship. The ultimate triumph to love is bittersweet and Suzanne Brockmann creates an epilogue that will twist your heart out with its poignancy. Her well-researched materials on armoury and SEAls serves to fortify the credibilty but it is the strength of her romance that marks it a royal treat.	2002-09-07

Badgered by an elf who mysteriously appears when she puts on the stone, she is most willing to return it to the owner. Her fateful trip starts an intergenerational romance with a three century old apparition Connal MacNeil. He believes that Josie is the chosen one to bear him a bairn to continue the lineage. Yet Josie isn't the submissive woman who bends to his will. He is intrigued by her spirit instead of lust and most unexpectedly surrenders his heart. It is with this pivotal decision that he acknowledges the fact he has failed the gods and his family obligations because he hasn't the heart to compel an offspring from Josie... The Charm Stone with its dash of humour and ensemble of amiable senior citizen surfers makes a splash with the sparklingly original romance. The fusion of magic, passion and legends along with the energetic couple sprouts buoyant fun and unfettered joy.	2002-09-07

For a start the cruiser carrying Arnaud, her father's hunchman and her exploded. She is fortunately rescued by the gorgeous and debonair Ex- Navy SEAL Michael Wright who sparks a hormonal craze in her. Unknown to her is his hidden agenda to bring nefarious felon Trevor Church to justice and revenge for his demised partner Hugo in a failed operation. He plans to use the expedient Tally as a bait but is unexpectedly fascinated by the sprite and courage despite her average looks. Treachery looms as Tally's life is under threat by murder and a spoiled half-sister....<br />The third full-length romantic novel by Cherry Adair continues the misadventures of the Wright brothers. In Too Deep lends its kinetics to the saucy Tally with much sass to spare and battling through her phobias of the dark, liquidations, explosions with courage. Michael Wright is the incumbent alpha-male with hidden secrets whom Tally reserves primal lust for. The passion is lusty and erotically-charged with palpable chemistry. It is bright bouncy whimiscal fun as they squabble and frenetic when they get into action.  It is with heart too - the triumvirate romance between the plain heroine, one-eyed pirate and a three-legged cat comes out starkly fractured but all the more warm and tender. Sure - the snappy dialogues may stray towards infantile and juvenile sometimes, but Cherry Adair's newest emerges swift and entertaining lubricated with cheery old fun that makes her contemporary romantic suspense one of the most notable this year.	2002-09-06

While maintaining the blazing heat factor, seasoned Harlequin author Jamie Denton has penned a textured romance with heart and fuses it with intricate suspense. Seduced by the Enemy focuses on Jared Romine, rogue ex-FBI who is linked to the murder of his partner Jack Dysert and aide to hot-shot senator Martin Phipps. When Peyton Douglas, his cherished ex-flames gets embroiled in a scam to suggest that she is fraudulent of pocketing the money that Jared was rumoured to have taken, he steps in after a 3-year hiding to save both of their lives. Passion sears between the lovers but it is the exquisite tenderness that makes this romance exceptional. Peyton braves through a thwarted pregnancy and wrestles with mistrust, insecurity and a proposal from an amorous suitor when she obviously has feelings for Jared. There is passion and complexed emotions which touches real feelings. Despite the hot melting sex, it is Denton's sincere characters that makes this short read devastating in its scale.	2002-09-06

In the process of embellishing with a more sensual tone, the novel has lost the simpler tenderness and magic that Lysette wields over the children. This tale of serendipitious romance in the bayous of Louisiana clearly gets improved in the area of narrative flair where Lisa Kleypas has smoothened the kinks - but otherwise the original is still our preferred choice.	2002-09-02

Indeed it triggers off a riot of adventures when he discovers that the highwayman is actually a lady in disguise - and desperate to protect her sister Verity from the frenetic pursuit of her evil brother-in-law Henry. Cyn offers to help this reluctant damsel-in-distress even to the extent of cross-dressing as a female. When Cyn recognizes that the lady is in fact Lady Chastity Ware who is notorious for her promiscuity, he is in for a shock. Contrary to what society brands her, Cyn is intrigued by her courage and obscured vulnerability. Their journey to send Verity to her protector is perilous with the Earl of Walgrave - their austerely abusive father breathing down their neck with treacherous intent. The danger aside, it is bouncy fun with the loggerheads exchanging witty sparring and outrageously decadent with the oddball couple venturing into an orgy.<br />Jo Beverley's debut novel for the Malloren series is a novelty for its refreshing plot and vibrant characters. It is by far one of the most audacious romance with a melee of cross-dressing, exquisite passion and perverse orgies. The charming female protagonist is a rebel soft at heart with bitterness; Cyn is an endearingly wicked angel with spunk and fun. The villain is a deranged father crippled by his avaricious greed and abusive nature. The scene whereby Chastity triumphs over her father's manipulation is heart-searingly poignant. My Lady Notorious is spry humour fused with heart and sensual passion and a riot of an adventure. Winner of the coveted RITA award, it is sparkling romance at its best. It reminds you that sometimes being bad isn't a bad thing after all.	2002-08-31

As the staunch leader of the Elliot wastrel pack, he has enforced discipline and elevate their tarnished status after his mother has married a St. John. It would glorify the Elliots even more if he could transform these future descendants to well-bred societal elites. Alas - these untenable children under the wicked manipulation of their grandmother strike a mutiny towards Anthony through nasty pranks and their terror has chased off any possible candidates for their governess. It seems Anna Thraxton has responded to the challenge. Tantalized by a handsome reward to soothe her dire straits and a possible recommendation for a job well-done, Anna finds herself unable to refuse his offer despite having to accommodate with the overbearing Anthony. What she did not forsee was the electric chemistry and sparks between them that presented the real challenge....<br />Karen Hawkins makes this read an affair to remember with palapble chemistry between Anna and Anthony that sizzles through snappy dialogues and memorable characterization. Their story is in fact far tighter and more superior than her last novel The seduction of Sara where the wit and romance sparkles. What was under-developed though was the mischievous party of five where they were auspiciously introduced with distinct characters. Ms. Hawkins left the reticent Richard hanging and the ending lacked a dramatic tug. Ms. Hawkins is as usual competent in her narrative flair and this rollicking fun read proves reassuringly that good old chemistry is class compared to the crass of overt passion in romance novels nowadays.	2002-08-25

The darkly brooding John is insistent in keeping a distance from her - his scarred past and his maimed leg makes him less than worthy a companion much less an amorous suitor. Even as their love blossoms, their fragile relationship is threatened by a killer pursuit from John's past....<br />Dancing at Midnight is Julia Quinn's sophomore work and is now reissued strategically after her wildly popular Romancing Mister Bridgerton. Yet the sparkling wits tangible in the latter is less robust than in this reissue. While toying with this tantalizing setting of uniting a lady with a war veteran, Julia Quinn crafts the flawed hero to be cloyingly sentimental and dull. It is thus fortunate Belle has enough sass to imbue the joyous mood that transcends across Quinn's works. Though not her best up-to-date, Dancing at Midnight possesses the fairy-tale charm, gorgeous poetry and wistful endings to waltz right into readers' hearts.	2002-08-20

Cheryl Holt's latest emerges garishly lewd with gratuitous voyeurism and a lack of moral conscience in the central protagonist Michael Stevens. Even the most jaded romance reader will be disconcerted by the infidel who treats the enamored Lady Sarah Compton shabbily by sequestering her to the country. Impoverished Sarah is fatefully thrust to a gala in Bedford where it is actually a clandestine orgy where peeping holes and illicit sex prevails. Exposed to the tempting Michael in his naked splendor titillates the virgin Sarah to taste the forbidden fruit. They start an affair and Michael is overwhelmed by his passion for Sarah but a scheme by her cousin Rebecca shatters the trust between the couple. Total Surrender aims to be erotic with the gurgitation of sexual scenes and explicit orgy. The romance is sadly feeble and ridiculously contrived. It is a lame excuse for Michael to debauch himself just because of the lack of paternal love - and also for readers to empathize with him. It languishes into a salacious and ignoramous sex read detached from emotions while we acknowledge the fact that this book is certainly not Holt at all.	2002-08-18

This has to be attributed to the formulaic plot of prodigal son Alec Dempsey returning to Freedom, Arkansas with a hidden agenda. As an ATF agent engaged to assist the FBI in recovering the lost coins as evidence to nail mob boss Joseph Ciccone and felon Ian Griggs, Alec has to face his cherished lost love Keira Morgan again. After his abrupt departure from the small-town a decade ago, Keira is left confused and despondent. The hurt she endured spawns the hostility towards Alec as the heartless deserter. In the face of treachery and sabotages, Alec and Keira is forced to acknowledge their passion. Alec takes on the role as a protective alpha male when Keira is harrassed by the vengeful Ian Griggs where she tips the police off five years ago and caused the death of his brothers. Their tenuous relationship festers under the intrusion of Keira's love rival Scarlet and her lack of trust. Slow Hands lacks the more developed romance and emotional intensity in its predecessor. While the suspense runs along smoothly, it is unequivocally the smoldering passion that raises temperature in the meandering story-line that diminishes the emotional connection between the two. Though the poignancy is more subdued here, Slow Hands nevertheless scorches sensually albeit in a decelerating mode compared to the swift Lone Rider.	2002-08-18

Bestselling author Mary Jo Putney weaves a plot of a celebrity couple - Kenzie Scott and Raine Marlowe while bordering on the verge of divorce finds themselves evaluating their options when Kenzie decides to take on the complex role of John Randall in Raine's directing debut - The Centurion. It is ironic when the role is a vicarious experience of Kenzie's battered childhood. Suffocating with the mounting paparazzi on his private life, Kenzie seeks solace in Raine's company - and finds themselves changed inexorably after the movie. Both are compelled to confront their personal demons and take a brave step towards commitment. Mary Jo Putney's romance could have been a melodramatic sludge if not for her honest and emotionally-charged characters who are surprisingly textured. While many developments of the plot were rendered gratuitous extras with its predictiblilty, her writing flows fluidly with flair. It is even more impressive when her style of flashbacks runs with ease and narrative grace. The spiral path meanders to unravel a love story with tortured heroes and ultimately faith to overcome our heart obstacles.	2002-08-13

No less intriguing is the the plot that revolves around hot-shot lawyer Judy Carrier stumbling onto a murder case in which Tony Lucia - an octogenarian particularly fond of pigeons - kills the influential Angelo Coluzzi out of vengeance. The read vacillates to expound on Tony's hatred towards Coluzzi. Not only did he perniciously murdered Tony's wife Silvana but claimed the lives of his son and daughter-in-law in an automobile sabotage. Lisa Scottoline shrewdly creates empathy for the defendant and then jolts us with provocative questions as to seek balance between compassion and justice. The last few pages fly by electrifyingly with Judy's twisting the evidence and solid arguments. Equally captivating is the scope on Italians' culture in Philadephia who integrates in the frenetic pacing of the novel to bring out texture beside the galvanizing action. The Vendetta Defense moves swiftly with its colorful ensemble of characters - and judiciously uses the procedural to excite and thrill.	2002-08-11

Besides suffering from infernal phantasm of carnage in Egypt, war-veteran Lord Adam Blackwood is haunted by past betrayals of his heart by two faithless women. He detaches himself from love when it unexpectedly arrives in the form of Lady Jillian Whitney who is the ward of the old earl of Fenwick. When Fenwick is murdered and Jillian is held as the prime suspect, chivalry prompts Adam to save her from the gallows - but could he be rescuing the murderer? The promising sypnosis deceptively plunges you to a plot full of intrigue then gravely disappoints you when the mystery is left undeveloped with a few suspects thrown in. It is thus a hoax to connect the would-be lovers together and erhm, fan the flames with blossoming passion. The intrigue is brittle - and Ms. Martin's much-too contemporary narration lacks the intricate flair of the regency period. So the weight of the story gravitates to the romance. It is thus fortunate that the characters Jillian and Adam have enough heart and emotional intensity. They catalyze this feeble plot-line with sincerity and scorching passion right through the heart-twisting epilogue that sprouts redemption and forgiveness.	2002-08-10

As an innocent spinster, Lady Abagail Weston is determined to seek tutelage from decadent profligate James Stevens in the areas of sexual experience. Her knowledge could prove useful to her niece Caroline who is embarking on her debut in the ton. The intriguing proposition starts on an odyssey to desires where James is beguiled by Abby's innocence. It becomes more of an intimate exchange of hearts and passion even as the cold mechanism of sex propels them to ecstasy. The dark brooding James detaches himself from love for fear of repeating his previous mistakes in a tragic love-match - and with Abby's modern sensibilities to obliterate social barriers - she just might be able to follow her heart and claim James's love as well. Love Lessons sizzles with Holt's unflinchingly blatant descriptions - and for the poignancy and redemptive powers of love over darkness.	2002-08-08

He manipulated his friends in his self-formed crime organization The Sowing Club to concoct a murder scheme by hoodwinking them into thinking that it was more of a mercy killing to end her sufferings by a debilitating disease. Little did he expect his wife to outsmart him by gathering his sordid evidence and send them to her niece Dr. Michelle \\"Mike\\" Renard. The nefarious felons soon invade Michelle's life so it is thus fortunate that Theo Buchanan from the Justice Dept. fatefully enters her life when Michelle rescues him after he fainted on her in a gala at New Orleans. The lean, hard pulsating thriller from second-timer Julie Garwood is fraught with fast twists, back-stabbings and deceptions that climaxes with a showdown at the hospital. The romance between the intelligent Michelle and chivalrous Theo adds on to the palpable tension instead of slowing down the frenetic pacing of pursuits and evil sabotages. Interweaving the small-town Louisians backdrop and charming interactions with the thriving community, the book crackles with humour, warmth and fraternity. This contemporary romance fuses cutthroat suspense to render it a mercifully entertaining read that will have Garwood's fans cheering.	2002-08-05

The timelessness of her latest reissue Almost Forever is a testament to her mastery at blending heart-melting passion with searing poignancy. Claire Westbrook, an introverted recluse and secretary to the alloy-researcher wiz Sam Bronson falls prey to the charms of Max Conroy. He is sent by Spencer-Nyle's enterprises to tap for information pertinent to their acquisition bid for the Bronson's company. Max finds it hard to concentrate on his mission when he is distracted by Claire's self-decprecating nature and vulnerability. His protective streak is powered by Claire's miscarriage and defenses around men including him. The seething betrayal and Claire's inferior nature makes their romance all the more out of reach. Her insecurity makes Max a knight errant - and their passion soars with exquisite tenderness. Ms. Howard's trademark alpha male and damsel-in-distress romance mixes intricately fairy-tale charm and burning emotions that garners her work acclaimed popularity that seems to last almost forever.	2002-08-05

The decadent Cyprian's ball arrives timely to suit her scheme - and it is at this fateful event that she falls head over heels for the righteous Colin Danvers who is branded a nefarious traitor by the Admiralty. In a coup-de-theatrics, a brawl ensues between Colin and his arch-rivals who tried to advance on Georgiana. He rescues her and Georgie is all the more determined that Colin is the one to share a night of passion with. It is one year later when they meet with Colin embarking on his espionage mission - and the elusive Georgie bearing his child arouses his love and suspicion of working as a French spy for Bonapartes....<br />Elizabeth Boyle's newest romance sans intrigue bears an uncanny resemblance to the plot of her previous effort Once Tempted. It is thus fortunate that the infectious ebullience of Georgie manages to salvage the coincidence-ridden plotting. Her quick wits and Colin's chivalry make them an intelligent golden couple. One night of passion is thus a fleeting pleasure with the energized duo steering their love voyage out of the fog of deja vu.	2002-08-04

Rest assured I will keep your identity a secret even though it is already exposed by popular romance novelist Julia Quinn on her latest effort Romancing Mr. Bridgerton that chronicles the love chapter between Penelope Featherington and the much-sought after bachelor Colin Bridgerton. I ardently recommend you this book which features your scintillating reports on the beau monde of the ton and the explosive pursuit by the ton to unmask you. Not to mention the nefarious Cressida Twombley trying to impersonate your highness in an avaricious scheme to get Lady Danbury's ... prize.<br />All these is secondary to the vibrant protagonist Penelope who charms with self-effacing humour and a heart of gold. She matures from an awkward debutante to a confident spinster while secretly yearning for the suave Colin who came back after slaking his wanderlust. He observes a new Penelope with robust intelligence and finds an inexplicable affinity with her. Love thunders in unexpectedly but the secret buried in Penelope (which I am sure you would surely know with your astuteness) threatens their nascent romance. <br />It is a most unexceptional book because it deviates from the trend of \\"throwing the bedroom door open\\" ubiquitous in romance novels nowadays. Bolstering on wits and plenty of heart (and lots of speculation and snooping on your identity), the relationship of love grows from secret admiration to platonic and to even trust and sacrifice. It calls upon the couple to confront their insecurities in order to arrive at their happy ending. One thing lacking though was the book dominated with your exploits and under-developed Colin's sudden affection for Penelope as a result.<br />It is with regret that I am apprised of your retirement. Never mind though - this book will serve to relive your memories on your infamous escapades. Gleefully intertaining with irreverent humour, it has been long that a romance book can rival the entertainment that only your publications can provide. I believe that Julia Quinn will earn my fanaticism as well as yours.	2002-07-29

Jude Deveraux begins the sorority read with a serendipitous meet at the New York Motor Vehicle Department where three women Leslie, Ellie and Madison fatefully exchanged their personal tales. When they reunite twenty years later at Maine, each is haunted and distressed by their personal lives. Leslie finds the happiness of her marriage on the verge of crumbling; Madison gave up a modeling career to care for her wastrel-of-a husband and Ellie is viciously betrayed by her husband, leaving her impoverished and depressed. The tale takes a twist when they chanced upon Madame Zoya who offers them the opportunity to relive their past for three weeks and leaving them open options thereafter. <br />The Summerhouse's unconventional plot is narrated with clarity from Deveraux's focused writing. Beneath the cloak of fun time-travelling and a glimpse of the past bears a gentle cautionary tale of living lives without regrets. The warmth of the friendship and reunion basks against the reclaiming of their self-esteem, love and belief. With such a bright perspective on the small miracles of life and luminous ever-afters, The Summerhouse engages as the perfect beach-read.	2002-07-26

A sophomore at Columbia University studying law, Jack Mullen is thrust into a labyrinth of corporate corruption when he sets out to avenge for his dead brother. Working as a valet for billionaire Barry Neubauer, Peter Mullen is murdered brutally at his Montauk Beach House but pronounced drowned by the local East Hampton PD. Tenacious to unravel the truth, Jack ignores harrassments and a retrenchment to gather the dirty evidence - but the surprise along the way is that Peter is more than what meets the eye...<br />The gulf between the rich and poor outlines the underlying theme - and the meting of justice at the epilogue albeit overblown and incredulous - warns of the equality of men under law. The miscreant is a menagerie of paedophilic perpetrators obstructing justice with their power and prestige. As a thriller, The Beach House does swerve along fast but readers accustomed to James Patterson's style may find it too slow for comfort and lack of surprises and twists.	2002-07-23

Only this time round her scope has widened with sheer ambition to juggle both romance and suspense to a perfect pitch. <br />Within a day, Claire Hayden discovers her marriage to successful Sans Francisco attorney David becoming diluted and meets his enigmatic friend Ian Marshall who sparks her suppressed desires. Her husband is slashed in the throat after his birthday party presided by herself - and suspects sprout hideously including her art-collector father Jean Leon along with close friends William and Elizabeth. Even the lurking Ian Marshall is not spared either from her paranoia...<br />After this point, The Chase begins relentlessly with pulsating suspense where Claire teams up with Ian as a Nazi Hunter to link the murder of David to a German spy Elgan. The story interweaves from the contemporary to 1935 North Wales to connect a poignant sub-romance plot on Elgan's cousin Rachel with Ian's uncle Eddy. Murder, deceit and espionage spearhead Joyce's venture into WW2 with vivid portrayal of the historic Holocaust. Joyce has painstakingly created the ghoulish atmosphere through anti-Jewish sentiments, rampant air-raids and battles and accurate descriptions of armaments in RAF like Spinfire. <br />While the plot may be over-reaching and in different time-period, Joyce stays focused in her development of central characters and romance. Claire and Ian display palpable chemistry as the investigating duo; Rachel and Eddy as star-crossed lovers in WW2 with doomed fate resonates with tenderness. Equally good is the suspense that jolts you with twists and hooks to make readers plunge to the next chapter - and the rousing epilogue finishes the chase to a climactic showdown to unmask the killer and link the Caroubet portrait to the murder.<br />No less gripping is the car-chase sequence and sprayed bullets. The jugular action catapults the taut thrillerto breakneck speed, fusing the dark mystery and multi-generational romance seamlessly. The Chase will leave you breathless - with awe - for Joyce is at her electrifying best.	2002-07-22

It is 2052 and sex is billed as a sports - and Titan Brian Bryne decides to take a deserving break after his triumph for the Sex Monarch in the tournament. He time-travels back to a Scots castle and chances upon Ally O'Neill who accompanies her aunt Katy on a ghost-busting trip. Fascinated by Brian and his time - and even more on his masculinity, she decides to make him the subject of her new novel by experimenting with him on sexual fantasies. While Night Games comes out as cheeky and raunchy with interesting concepts like the Constructor and sex sports, it remains sparse with under-developed plots and too much focus on sex. The passion between Ally and Bryan may be hot but the main characters suffer with too many sub-characters to stifle their presence. The main players are definitely out of the game this time round.	2002-07-22

Lara Lewis, her central protagonist, decides to embark on a self-discovery tour to France after her twenty-year old marriage with her husband Bill crumbles with his infidelity. She rediscovers youth and courage with a new-found, younger lover Dan Holland who is a handyman engaged by Lara. <br />Adler's affectionate prose pours over the flight delays, messed-up hotel reservations and lost directions in France. Her penchance for details judiciously sums up the beauty in Provence, the glamor in Cannes and the architectural majesty of the Louvres. Cafes, delicacies like prunes and wine sumptuously tease the imaginations of readers. It's great fun and certainly vivacious travel read. The same though cannot be said of the monotonous romance that interrupts the flow of the travel passage with over-dramatized passion. The naive and indecisive Lara is difficult to empathize with. She punctuates the novel with wanting to reconcile with her betraying husband (read:weak) and afraid to love Dan. The conflicts drone on but it's really the travelling we are interested in.	2002-07-19

Set in 1826 London, Westminister magistrate Max de Rohan gets unwittingly embroiled in a murder case. His friend, Lady Delacourt has enlisted his assistance to unearth the culprit behind her sister-in-law Lady Sands's death. A sapphire heirloom is stolen - and shadows of paranoia begin to surface when potential felons in the form of a cuckolded Harry Markham-Sands and her clandestine paramours are under investigation. <br />Max finds himself dealing not only with internal affairs but affairs of the heart when he meets Lady Catherine Wodeway.

Judiciously using Max's grandmother tarot-card play as a dread-inducing prologue, she blends in delicious red herrings to intensify the mystery-murder drama. Yet all is secondary to the top-notch romance between the darkly brooding  Max and the impassioned Catherine that burns the page up with sizzling passion and searing poignancy. She develops Max with vulnerability and desire to be accepted despite his flawed past. True - Max may be no true gentleman, but he may take pride in the fact that he clinches my choice as this year's true romance hero.	2002-07-14

A reissue from 1991 on Lowell's series of the Mackenzie's Western Lovers - Warrior is reassuringly old-fashioned romance with smoldering chemistry between rancher Nevada Blackthorn and wildlife biologist Eden Summers. Haunted by his grisly past as a war veteran in Afghanistan, Nevada has dispelled and resisted any coil of emotions to resurrect a cold and unfeeling exterior. Yet Eden Summers has penetrated his resilience with her strong belief in love as a healing power - one that would bind them as one or separate them forever. Smoothly setting the passionate story in the grand plains of Colorado, Lowell judiciously uses the nature of cougars to compliment the savagery of Nevada - and explore his gentleness. What is most potent about Warrior though - is the unleashing of coiled emotions of love and its unexpected poignancy between the wounded souls to render it a lacerating experience of passion at its most elemental.	2002-07-12

Though No Man's Mistress might have mellowed in sharp wits and comic relief when juxtaposed to her charming hardcover More than a mistress, Mary Balogh judiciously levels up the emotions and drama to a perfect pitch on her take with Lord Ferdinand Dudley and Viola Thornhill. On his watershed journey to Pinewood Manor that is won in a reckless wager, Ferdinand finds himself bewitched by a local beauty - who later turns out to be the asserted owner of the estate. Viola is outraged when Ferdinand upsets her coveted security by insisting upon his legal claim to the estate when it was promised to her. She plans to drive him away with the enlisted assistance of her crew including Mr. Paxton, her steward et al but her efforts only gained Lord Dudley popularity. <br />Through an unexpected turn of events with Duke Of Tresham (Ferd's brother) exposing Viola's identity as a disreputable courtesan as the pivotal moment, Ferdinand is induced by ambiguity over his infatuations over her innocent portrayal. Fear of losing the manor and her livelihood, she is forced to seduce Ferdinand with her carnal expertise but finds herself unable to comply with the love she feels for him - which leaves only one option - her imminent departure...<br />No Man's mistress is kept buoyant by the dramatic twist of the story that unfolds stylishly under Ms. Balogh's smooth narration. Her characters show surprising dimensions in their display of love and tenderness; they are flawed beings special in their courage and vulnerability. The ensemble of sub-characters with the likes of Tresham and the duchess manoeuvres the luscious romp along brilliantly through their match-making plots that had Ferdinand soaring as Viola's protector. The eclectic fusion of characters along with intricate plotting is enough to make Ms. Balogh - the sensual mistress of Regency romance - in every word.	2002-07-10

With much spunk and panache, the romance between fiercely independent spinster Lady Olivia Fairfax and the irresistible George Carstairs, Lord Rival shimmers with chemistry through witty repartees and vivid characterization. No less credible is the unpredictible plot that sees the impoverished Lord Rival scheming to catch his golden goose through marriage only to fall hopelessly in love. The plot reveals dimensions to Lord Rival's character where you see the scum metamorphosize into a knight in shining armour to rescue his inherited crumbling estate. Lady Fairfax is adamant in remaining single after surviving love's disappointment. Their hesitations and monetary barriers makes their romance even more precarious. She connects a sub-plot of spousal abuse to shade light on Lady Olivia's compassion and resilience as well as Lord Rival as the unlikely rescuer. Diane Farr proves herself an ingenious talent in crafting strong plots and characters. This delightful outing with its scintillating pace shines with wits and heart.	2002-07-06

The circle of friends including Necie, Caro and Teensy will charm you with their individual charms. This book however is more evocative on its insights to personal experiences and growth - understanding heartaches and emotional traumas. The poignancy of Vivi's torment with her motherhood and problems lends an emotional core to the energetic story. Rebecca Wells pens the story with heart and humour - and ultimately beautiful characters residing in the town of Louisiana.	2002-07-06

Joyce's series unfurls like a soap opera that is shamelessly dramatic and her latest effort Deadly Desire is no exception. The book opens with a vandalism of Sarah Channing's portraits - and as her brother's fiancee, Francesca feels obliged to root out the culprit. The mystery is actually a red herring though because as the book progresses, you find the subplot a diversion to the love affairs of Fran. She is thrust between the married police commissioner Rick Bragg and his half-brother Calder Hart. Rick's wife Leigh Anne returns to claim back him; Hart wishes to marry Fran - and Fran's brother Evans is hitched to Sarah's cousin Countess Bartolla. Add this on to threats heaped onto Rick's sister Lucy and a kidnap attempt on her children to put Fran's sleuthing skills to the test, this book deliciously taunts you on the stunning revelations of the characters' personal lives. Deadly Desire is guilty of being an overblown melodrama but it is a guilty pleasure with the readers caught in the whirlwind affairs and their options. Brenda Joyce pens it fast and straight - though the mystery here is a feeble one to engage readers, Deadly desire proves an engaging read to indulge in scandals and multi love-triangles.	2002-06-30

A Wicked Seduction tells of bounty hunter Joelle Summers who embarks on her latest assignment to bring felon Dean Coulter to justice after he jumped bail. Little did she know that a mistaken identity was in the making when Dean - a repectable CEO of a thriving traffic company had his identification purloined by the wanted crook. The captor-prey relationship is ignited by smoldering desires and electric chemistry between Jo and Dean. Under the cloak of hot passion, they are welled up in personal traumas. Jo is haunted by the guilt at seeing the death of her rookie partner; Dean grips with the shadows of his father who struggled with the business and neglects his family. The escapade is a temporary shelter for their problems but when the time arrives for them to face the daunting possibility of love, they each have to make their own choices. A Wicked Seduction is richly textured with emotions that flourishes in a cauldron of erotic passion. Janelle Denison just keeps getting better with each book and her talents at crafting a tight narration should have by now, seduce more fans.	2002-06-30

You begin to wonder why Robin Schone - a frequent excellent contributor was excluded and brought in new entries from Nikki Donovan and Liz Madison. <br />This is not to say the budding talents are not good. Liz Madison threw in an impressive debut with a medievial romance in England 1250 which tells of Victoria Woodville, a female warrior grappling with the daunting task of protecting her homeland from a despot who craves on territorial expansion. She falls in love with an ally - Stephen de Burgh of Normadic origin and learns to trust him in battling the enemy together. Her style reminiscent of Virgina Henley pleases but lacks the spark of originality and erotic abundance. Nikki Donovan pens \\"Enchanted\\" - a surreal tale about the intimidating Beast of Lord kidnapping the lady Esmay to remove his curse through carnal relations. The entry suffers from an overload of sex with a contrived romance between undeveloped characters to whack its flaccid premise. <br />Veterans Bertrice Small and Susan Johnson scores better, both playing the elements of erotica and romance to a perfect pitch. Particularly Johnson in \\"Out of the Storm\\" who proves herself a maverick in creating sensual dialogues and a sizzling couple. She notches up the erotic atmosphere with an unconventional relationship between Lady Darlington and her stepbrother Prince Radovsky through a fateful meeting in the storm. Bertrice Small stretches the boundary with a love story between a courtesan and an enamored customer. It is erotically charged and her female protagonists is particularly strong and cunning though some may be put off by some debauched scenes of threesomes. <br />The romance element is sadly missing in this erotic anthology which strays towards giving readers a hot sex read. Theymay be delighted but without a stronghold of memorable romance, it falls below the expectations. Disappointed is the word.	2002-06-28

The strength of the book bolsters on the central protagonists - Graham Wessit and Submit Channing Downes. The former being the Earl of Netham who is rocked by a recent scandal over an allegation by a girl who gets impregnated by him and the latter a mourning widow who is entrusted by her husband to deliver the Pandetti box to Graham. The contents of the box are salacious drawings by a royal artist called Pandetti which caused the public ostracizing of Graham. It is later revealed that it is a scheme of Henry to see Graham destroyed.<br />Black Silk is highly descriptive and vivid but at times it reduces the novel to a pretentious and verbose mode. The romance is slow and is more of a character study that unfolds quietly through the turn of events.It reveals depth in Graham and his paradox on sex and love. It displays Submit's inclination to sensual awakening and bursting out of her mourning for her husband yet guilty of doing so. The ghost of Henry hangs unauspiciously in the wake of their nascent love and the obstacle in the form of Rosalyn Schild as a lover of Graham threatens their romance. <br />Black Silk certainly isn't for the mainstream romance readers who wants their novels fast and snappy. It slowly meanders through the past events of the characters to fully develop them -like legal contest of wills, Graham's children et al. Their romance grows from utter strangers to a platonic form then graduates to desire and passion. Its ending may be a bit overblown but for readers who take it slow - they may find the read ultimately satisfying.	2002-06-27

It is hence a largely predictible plot that is penned straight by Laurens with little surprises. <br />Despite this, FOUR IN HAND is kept spry in its narration by Lauren's firm grasp in her regal style. Max Rotherbridge was a viscount before he ascends to dukedom after the demise of his uncle in an accident. Little did he expects his obligations would include offering his protection to four delectable ladies of Twinning. Their stunning beauty propel them to the toast of the ton - and the duke of Twyford finds it a daunting task to fend off rakes and unwanted attraction. Even he himself is stumbled by his desire for the eldest Twinning sister Caroline - and it would prove a scandal if he falls in love with his ward....<br />It is a light-hearted and wispy romance that is kept bustling through Lauren's vivacious descriptions of baroque balls, glitzy parties where gossips are rampant among priggish countesses, flirtations are exchanged and hearts are lost. Her characters are equally measured in terms of exuberance - there is the matured Caroline, the naughty minx Arabella, the innocent Lizzie and the sensible Sarah. Lady Augusta Benborough, Max's aunt and the girls' chaperon also makes a welcoming presence. They each find their suitors and ultimately marriage proposals from the rakes...  <br />I do like Lauren's style and passionate prose but I would even  gladly welcome a change of her plots anytime to banish the staleness of the typical \\"rakes tempting ladies\\" storyline - that has been recycled from 1999 till now.	2002-06-27

The recurring spate of scandal over the kidnap by Morgan Pryce gone awry two years ago has sent the distressed Lady Juliet Laverick to confront him - only to be apprehended by the shocking news from his twin Sebastian, Lord Templemore that he has mysteriously vanished. Apparently there's more than meets the eye - Juliet is convinced that it is Sebastian who has abducted her and she is determined to root out the truth through the web of lies he has spun....<br />Sabrina Jeffries's After the Abduction forms the romance trilogy on the Laverick sisters - and this is her latest triumph to emerge with sparkling wits and an effervescent chemistry between Sebastian and Juliet. You will be dazzled by the entrancing hum of atmosphere imbued by the secondary characters comprising of Griff Knighton and Lady Rosalind (Juliet's sister) who adds on to a textured subplot that sees Rosalind trying to conceive through unorthodox methods and Griff's jealousy and paranoia of a tryst between Sebastian and his wife. No less luminous is Sebastian's uncle with his dry and sardonic wits to play an enlightening aide and conspirator in Sebastian's shenanigan. <br />In fact you will already be dazzled by the plot which twists its way through to unravel Sebastian's obligations, brotherly love and how his abduction scheme has made Juliet miserable with the malicious gossip. It is a comedy of errors and love that climaxes with a duel to challenge honor. The passion between the golden couple is a sensual blast crackling with erotic foreplay in a game of chess and a shooting practice. <br />Ulitmately it is Jeffries's wits and beautifully crafted characters that will enchant you most. Sebastian and Juliet are both suppressed characters with a big heart and plenty of love. They make the dynamic duo who drives this rollicking adventure of passion and wits to a stupendous comic riot that will have your heart long abducted before you finish this gorgeous read.	2002-06-27

With her previous effort Suddenly You as the pivotal shift to sensual romance, Lisa Kleypas displays an unprecedented fluidity in her latest, Lady Sophia's Lover to rival the smooth passion and chemistry between her main characters - Lady Sophia Sydney and Sir Ross Cannon. The spark of experiment and fun in Suddenly You may be missing but Ms. Kleypas delivers her characters in refreshing maturity steeped in moral quandry. Lady Sophia is determined to seek justice on her own mantle when she hears from her aunt that her brother John is mercilessly thrown into prison by the imperious chief magistrate who rules Bow Street with an iron hand. Sir Ross Cannon is assaulted by a perplexing attraction upon receiving Sophia's desire to be his assistant. With much reluctance he agrees - but swears that she will be under his protection. <br />Lisa Kleypas deftly intertwines romance with an explosive drama that fuels mayhem and treachery which conflicts with relationships and ties. The villain, Nick Gentry - a notorious gangster mob boss shows naunced emotions; Ross is broodingly dark with his demons while Sophia is trapped between loyalty and a blossoming love. The characters are handled with tact and emotions. Lady Sophia's Lover is Kleypas at her sizzling best with more steamy passion but it is ultimately her evocative romance that promises an enriching read which isn't just mere seduction.	2002-06-22

One thing though is certain though: Suzanne Enoch's latest romance lacks the spontaneity and the appealing characters of the former - and the plot runs predictably to muffle the laughs and wits. <br />Lady Georgiana Halley is tenacious to teach &quot;a lesson of love&quot; to the notorious rake of the ton, Viscount Dare. You see - Georgiana was cheated of her virginity by Tristan six years ago when she became the pawn in his wager. Feeling bruised and humiliated when she witnessed Tristan ensnaring a new victim, Amelia Johns, she decides to collaborate with Amelia for a payback while promising Amelia that Tristan will propose to her in return. She moves in with Tristan's aunts and finds herself reserving feelings for the reformed rake especially for his love towards his brothers. Tristan sees past the belligerent Geogiana to find a woman still in love with him. When their love blossoms, they face their own doubts. Could it be a shenanigan by Tristan to ensnare her fortunes to ease his dire straits? Could Georgiana be fuelled only by revenge?<br />Suzanne Enoch moves the comedy of love with her scintillating pace and snappy dialogues. However the plot runs on ridiculous grounds and much of the story revolves too much on revenge plotting, monetary gains and mistrust that spoils the romance. The revenge is juvenile and foolish. There is a lack of sensibility and maturity in Georgiana and Tristan - such as the recklessness of their tryst towars the end. The Rake begins well to start off the laughters in a comedy of manners and romance, but the contrived plot mutes both characters and the wits.	2002-06-22

Her debut historical romance Beyond Innocence though racy and steamy comes out of platitude because of the constraint of its typical plot. In Beyond Seduction, she delivers a much more provocative romance that explores different facets of sexuality. <br />Merry Vance, the daughter of Duke of Monmouth cherishes her freedom and has no intentions of abiding by her mother Lavinia's fervent wishes for her to marry Baron Althrop's son Ernest. Fear of her past affair with Althrop being exposed to her husband, she is forced to compromise Merry's happiness. Merry is pushed to the wall and finds herself succumbing to being a model for the notorious but talented artist Nicolas Craven in a twist of fate. What she did not gamble on was the inexplicable attraction that bounded Merry to the complex Nicolas...<br />Emma Holly's latest historical romance may be sexually explicit and at some times challenging the boundaries of romance to hint of decadent carnal adventures like menage a trois and homosexualism. It is precisely Ms. Holly's courage to push the envelope that makes Beyond Seduction her most accomplished historical romance. Her characters, Merry and Nicolas are flawed and both vulnerable with their insecurities. Merry's plain beauty catches the eye of Nicolas in his portrait of her as Godiva. It is her candor and independence - and ultimately her undying love for Nicolas that makes him confront his own demon and guilt to his \\"son\\". <br />Beyond Seduction is lusciously tempting with the flagrant sexuality but it is even more evocative and poignant when Merry and Nicolas both fight off temptations and remain committed. It explores facets of sexuality - from naivete, experimentation to understanding faith and promises. Though I would like the ending to be less abrupt with Lavinia's sudden shift of character and less fairy tale like, it remains quinessentially a romance. Ms. Holly has proven that she has gone further beyond seduction to present a romance with heart that rekindles wounded souls. This is no doubt the erotic romance of the year.	2002-06-16

His first charitable attempt which has gone awry leads him to a betrothal with an American shipping heiress, Quinn Peverill. Quinn is indomitable and fiercely independent, refusing to submit to the watchful eyes of the ton in London - and much less to being manacled to a mercenary marriage to the stodgy Lord Marcus. Her reputation is threatened by gossipmongers that saw both of them together - unchaperoned. Lord Marcus finds his anonymity as the brigand conflicts with his marriage to the charming Quinn. Quinn takes in his pretense as a social pedigree and hides her philanthropic efforts to build a school for the poor and orphaned. Only one thing though - she needs the help of the Saint....<br />A Rebellious Bride sparks no surprise - nor disappointment. It is a conventional plot that bridges two mismatched lovers together and twists it with double identity and gives a twist of love and humour. Although the plot is relatively slowed down by the clashing of the oddball couple, it is kept alive through wicked banters and hilarious ironies. Ms. Hiatt manages to steer the story with energized characters and humour.	2002-06-16

The two stories set in London in 1500s, Secret Admirer and Lady Killer may be overly sprawling in its plot and numerous twists but the efforts are atmospheric in its surrealistic realm to propel chills and surprises. Secret Admirer tells of Lady Tuesday Airlington who is haunted by dreams of The Lion obsessed with the word W - a murderer who kills her husband and sets out to frame her when Lawrence Pickering, an official to assist the Queen to counter smuggling rings gets caught in the murderer's intricate plot to ultimately destroy him. Lady Killer features a lady sleuth Clio Thornton and her simian partner Toast on the trails of a vampire fiend where innocent females from Devonshire seemed to be the target. Viscount Miles Loredon has supposedly slain off the villain three years ago and when Clio approaches him to solve the mystery together, he finds himself facing his demons yet again. Their blossoming romance is threatened by the prospects of his impending marriage to Clio's cousin and suspected identity of Clio as the vampire itself.... <br />Both romances are sensual and poignant and the murder plots are staged intricately and intelligently - albeit many clues may be too much of a coincidence. Nonetheless, Michele Jaffe has proven her a talent to watch with her crafted crime plots full of shenanigans and delicious red herrings. In the tradition of Gaelen Foley, her narration is clear and focused - and it is double happiness when readers are treated to this hefty but enjoyable read.	2002-06-16

Nan, the central protgonist is juggling her studies at NYU and being a nanny to Grayer X under the watchful eyes of demanding and querulous Mrs. X. The book is saturated with her trials - like running extra errands and searching for a particular type of lavendar linen water, dressing Grayer for a Halloween party, whizzing through &quot;family outings&quot; with eccentric groups of people and hounding Mrs. X for her salary. It is however, beneath the cloak of laughter that we find The Nanny Diaries weirdly disturbing for the portrait of dysfunctional families when Nicolas Kraus and Emma McLaughlin weave poignancy into the relationship of nannies becoming more of a surrogate mother. Infidelites of Mr. X and betrayal, Mrs. X's relentless control over Grayer is what makes The Nanny Diaries a textured social commentary under the comical gloss-over. The characters are vividly portrayed with sensitivity - and it is over issues like installing Nanny-cams, negligent mothers that makes it a witty and sardonic read. It also raises the question as to whether these encounters are fact or fiction. It's a satire on our reality.	2002-06-14

Working for industrialist Stan Winston as a security provider, Maddy is distraught when she has lost his daughter Dawn to an old-time enemy of the family, Reynold and decides to team up with ex-CIA agent Jack Connor to retrieve her back from the clutches of a mob boss under the guise as a crime-lord and his love-interest. To get their acts together, Jack persuades her to open sexually to him even though he feels hard to admit he reserves feelings for Maddie. Through dangers and surveillance in the Orchid Island, they find treachery amidst which threatens their lives and binds them together....<br />Rebecca York combines action and passion, charging the relationship between Maddy and Jack with erotic tension which is the main focus. The action is regrettably cliche - and there are highly improbable situations - like the experienced Maddy being duped by Reynold's mistress and the escape part just came too easy. However it is undeniable that this is a romance at heart - and it shimmers with mutual lust and intense passion.	2002-06-09

Her latest blazer tells of private investigator Jillian Hennessy embarking on an important case that may catapult her to the CEO of Hennessy detective firm operated by her uncle. Hot on the trails of a fraud called Stanley who successfully sued the Tampas Police Dept for inflicted injuries, she uses her surveillance monitors to spy on him. When her uncle states the wrong address, she ends up being an unwitting voyeur drawn to the gorgeous Cade Lawrence - who has a hidden agenda of his own. He is also an undercover cop employed to bust Stanley and find evidence to expose Stanley as a cheat...<br />While the focus may be on the voyeurism and sensuality, Julie Elizabeth Leto proves even more laudable for the emotional romance that bridges two vulnerable souls who connects with love and passion. It is an essentially love story and Ms. Leto sensitively treads voyeurism to explore on the sexually-charged romance. Between careers, each has to make sacrifices and while Jillian believes the affair to be temporary, she has no idea that Cade had already lost his heart. Ms. Leto's romance novella is consistently readable and her sexy uplifitng tale is a winner.	2002-06-01

Ms. Bevarly's narration is full of hyphenated repetitions and long (and I do mean - long) names that spells tiresome and banal. Her story which involves Ruby Runyon, a waitress aspiring to be an actress meets a mob-related boyfriend Jimmy and when she knows he is married, she is eager to escape and lands herself on a ship Mad Tryst commandeered by Prince Reynaldo of Pelagia. She meets the deliciously handsome Keaton Danning who is the advisor to Reynaldo and Countess Arabella of Toulaine and heads for an adventure...<br />It is slow-paced and flat-out predictible. Even Ms. Bevarly writes in her novel that readers will call her plot insubstantial. While the saving grace is the chemistry between Keaton and Ruby and a much more interesting secondary romance between Arabella and the bartender Gus, the tale of choosing freedom over obligations is too far-fetched to become palatable. The humour is just too over-the-top-and-too-trying and it really takes a lot of patience to get through the first part of the book which most reader regrettably don't have.	2002-06-01

Her friends Cece and Serena seek passion in the arms of playboy Nicholas Zuber and sheriff Frank respectively. However love always don't come easy when Billy is ensnared by a tenacious enamored single mother who fawns over his parents and using her kid as an excuse to further her advances; Zuber can't change his frivolous ways in the face of business and Frank isn't sure that Serena can accept him as an equal partner with their deviant background...<br />Sure, Blonde Heat is full of sizzling passionate scenes and is a breezy irreverent read filled with bitchy remarks and celebration of the women's camaderie. Jealousy, rage and dumb blonde vengeance are refreshingly detailed by Johnson. Yet one feels the lack of development in the characters' premise especially Lily in her angst of her marriage. Lily and Billy's romance could have been a poignant one but one gets the feeling that Susan Johnson intends to rush to the next carnal description. It is erotic and smoldering but Blonde Heat is a no-holds-barred reckless ride that lacks a bit of subtlety and redemption to strike gold.	2002-05-31

When news of Stuart's demise after a manslaughter complicated by the typhus epidemic, James decides to claim Stuart's body to bury in the ancestral hall and is unprepared for the wretched life Emma is subjected to.<br />He finds himself intrigued by the independent widow who teaches the underprivileged kids, who fends off eager suitors trying to hook her up with a marriage proposal with eyes set on the bequeathed money that is attached to her marriage. James is tenacious to put a stop and marries her in her utmost reluctance. He decides to convince Emma that he intends to secure her to him this time round with wooing and passion....<br />While Ms. Cabot has a penchance for creating wonderful sub-characters like Lady Denham, Judge Reardon and the meddlesome peasants, her humour in this outing falls short and less furious than her previous efforts. It is nonetheless an enchanting treat when Ms. Cabot imbues a fairy-tale mood and languid sensuality in her narration. The protagonists are as usual captivating in their own rights - a reformed rake and a resilient widow. Kiss The Bride may not be her best effort, but it is a sheer delight.	2002-05-28

Melanie George is indeed at the top of her game here. She delivers her impressive contemporary debut, THE MATING GAME after her success in the historical field mainly the Devil's series. It's a sheer bliss as she spins the comedy with a sparkling dose of wits and panache - narrating how romance novelist Zoe Wilde aka Mallory Ginelli strucks a deal with the reclusive British sex professor Dextor Harrington to participate in his research on love and emotions with a handsome payoff. Mallory needs the money to free her sister from her debtors; Dextor enlists her help to aid him in further knowing a woman when he is about to be married. It's a win-win situation but it all crumbles when the equation ineffably switches to love chemistry.<br />It's an all-out riot with Ms. George's cynical characters manifested in Freddie, Mallory's Jewish best friend; Cummings - Dextor's friend ... assistant and a delightful ensemble of sub-characters. Yet it is the golden couple Mallory and Dextor who charms with their insecurities and vulnerablities. Mallory is resilient as a sister and Dextor is tied down by his traditons as an earl and his shame as a test-tube baby. Their relationship is tender faith and friendship maturing to passion and chemistry. <br />It'a a laugh-aloud ritual with George's self-effacing characters in their cloak of thorns. It is funny as it is warm and gratifying as the characters weather their miseries through dark secrets like a sexual abuse and bridges torn relationship. The MATING GAME is certainly the spunkiest and most energetic contemporary so far with George's radiant pen. It's a blast.	2002-05-26

In term of quality too - when the monotonous plot tears asunder the promising sensual premise of Amelia Cynster's marriage plan to Lucien Ashford. The trival plot of a theft and the slow pacing of the story leaves no outlet for development. One can imagine the speed of the narration when it takes 421 pages to convince Luc to declare his love. While Laurens tries to salvage the sinker with her trademark sensuality, the passionate scenes become rapidly overblown and none so subtle as her sizzling scenes in On a Wild Night. Even the characters drop in their appeal. One wonders how insensitive and childish can Amelia be in her flirting with other gentleman just to get Luc's attentions. Luc's possessive nature borders too much on jealousy and rage. On a Wicked Dawn degenerates into a mundane read as realization dawn upon yawning readers that Laurens is out of her league in this one.	2002-05-24

He feels inferior beacuse of his Whitechapel pedigree and decides to abandon his enamoured Maddie to seek out a fortune before coming back to claim her as his wife. Little did he expect that Maddie marries the profligate Lord Sedgewick. He feels betrayed and vengeful. So much so that he pays the debt that beleagured Maddie and demands repayment in the form of marriage. His ulterior motive is to secure the land that is bequeathed to Maddie. Yet when Maddie rejects his proposal, she gives in to the seduction trysts that ensues between then while hiding a deep secret that will change their relationship....<br />Without giving away the plot, let's just contend with the fact that Brock has caused a lot of hurt to Maddie with his pride and lack of insight. Yet love makes fool of all of us - and Brock and Maddie matures towards the epilogue to clear away their misunderstandings. Their love is riddled with thorns of insecurity and seated vengeance - and readers will no doubt seep into this melodrama inexorably. It is fortunate that Shelley Bradley has fluidly narrated their overwrought love story and gloss it with sensuality. The love scenes sizzle and crackle. Though to some cynics it may not convince them to endear themselves to the thick-skulled Brock, yet STRICTLY SEDUCTION comes alive with Bradley's impassioned writing. It renders it a strictly love-or-hate affair.	2002-05-19

In the surreal realm of the book, it describes how Marquelle Tamryn Green as the formidable She-Lord meets her fated soul-mate Jorlan Reynard who is against the convention of the submission of males. When Anya Reynard is threatened by Claudine, a powerful and possessive She-Lord who is jealous of Green to submit Jorlan over to her, Green has no choice but to marry Jorlan to save him from her clutches. Yet Jorlan has no wish to be bonded but when their passion rises with the differences in their social role, they are forced to compromise or let the evil plots of Claudine  ruin their tenuous relationhip.<br />Dara Joy has outdone herself with the complexity of the novel to examine social status and gender roles. The drama unfurls imaginatively with strange elements; of meteor blades, of Septibunal which is the governing council, of aristocracy, of pleasurer and of the planet Forus. It is a fascinating platform to dissect our human civilization - and as an erotic novel, the passion between Jorlan and Green sizzles with their unorthodox coupling. Ritual of Proof no doubt engages with Jorlan's triumph to do away with social convention - and his search for freedom and equality. <br />Ritual of Proof is part fantasy and part romance which is exceptionally well crafted by Joy - and with this book she has proven herself a talent who shows uncompromising dimensions.	2002-05-18

Given to his ruthlessly cynical uncle by his parents, Sterling Harlow grows up to be a replica of the curmudgeon without paternal love. He ignores his mother's pleas to reconcile and swears to reclaim his Arden Manor. With the demise of his mother, Sterling now the duke of Devonbrooke decides to repossess his house and throw Laura Fairleigh and her siblings aside. He is jealous of the care his mother had showered upon strangers rather than her son. <br />His trip unexpectedly causes him a fall which led to amnesia. He is awakened by a kiss from Laura who, being compelled by circumstances, claims him to his husband Nicholas. A passion ensues between them but Laura knows her happiness will be threatened by Nichola's real awakening...<br />Teresa Medeiro once again breathes imagination into her story. Peopled with entertaining characters like Lottie and George as well as her servants Cookie, it crackles with warmth and laughter. It is ultimately a tale of love and redemption which under Medeiro's silver pen becomes wispy and poignant. It is sensual and laced with snappy dialogue - and the characters are brimming with emotions. This deliciously frothy read should make it a tale to be remembered.	2002-05-18

When Ronnie returns to Fossil, Washington upon receiving the devastating news of her sister Crystal murdered by her husband Eddie, she hurries back to her niece Lizzy and plans to sell the bar that Crystal has inherited. Her original intentions gets impeded by the deliciously roguish Cooper who is the bartender of Honky Tonk. He compels her to take over the vacated position of the waitress - and her sister's house is leased to him. Staying under the same roof will hurtle both of them to catastrophe with their hostility. However passion heats up with their sizzling chemistry hanging - and what with Cooper hiding the true agenda - investigating Eddie's (his half brother) case - things will no doubt get a little bit complicated.<br />Susan Andersen compensates the lack of complexed characters with fluid narration that strums with laughter and joy. It engages the readers to fall head over heels with the flawed characters and their insecurities towards marriage with their scarred childhood. Ronnie desires security and Cooper yearns for her trust; it is a tussle of emotions and conflicts. The honesty of the emotions may be muted by the comedic pitch of the book, but it is fast and passionate enough to elicit a riot.	2002-05-16

She is however, attracted to Caleb Hamilton who is the bastard son of the ill Lord Hamilton and branded by the ostracizing society as the imposter to challenge the will of Lord Hamilton...<br />Though predictible and at times slow-moving, Ms. London deftly intertwines passion and empathy for her flawed characters. Readers will embrace Sophie for her enlightenment towards pursuing her love-path and enjoy the eccentric Madame Fortier as a sub-character. It is however Ms. London's style which is reminiscent of classics writer Jane Austin that distinguishes her to be a talented storyteller - and makes The Secret Lover a royal treat.	2002-05-12

If only the wild repartee and witty dialog had manifested in this charming read, Ms. Laruens would have scored perfection. Nevertheless her sizzling narration has elevated to a wild feverish pitch here.	2002-05-10

Her insecurities in her figure has propelled her to bulimia - and her trust in a man was betrayed. She later learns that life never rains but pours when her yacht is being \\"commandeered\\" by undercover agent Max Zamora in his escape from an obnoxious drug lord after killing off his son. Lola is held captive. She retaliates - only to damage the yacht and leaving them stranded at high sea. As Max and Lola are being trapped together in this absurd situation, they grow dependent on each other - and soon passion comes in - but will their love triumph over their differences?<br />Rachel Gibson has been experimenting with more deviant characters apart from those \\"Gibson-type\\", down-to-earth sweethearts. Her earlier effort True Confession unites a sheriff and a city reporter and now - a model and an undercover agent. Which is fine - when Ms. Gibson starts out well with snappy dialogues, swift action and scorching romance. However in all its fast pacing, Ms. Gibson neglects her trademark sub-characters and emotional development that renders the romance incredible but palatable. The humour ranks comparably less energetic than that of True Confession - with all its sexist remarks that are too banal. Still, Max and Lola manages to bolster the read with irresistible chemistry that shows Ms. Gibson hasn't lost her touch - completely.	2002-05-04

Lori Foster's maiden release with Brava crackles with the right amount of temptation and warms up with endearing heroines and mouthwatering heroes to up the romantic ante.

She protectively defends Noah when Agatha believes that he is the unfaithful one to the commitment and threatens to disinherit him if he does not continue the relationship with the daughter of Agatha's business associate. <br />Noah could not believe her fierce emotions and smoldering sensuality masked under Grace's strait-laced self.

Dying to Please is no exception and it aims to gratify readers with her trademark smoldering sensuality and jugular suspense. Her female protagonist this time round is butler Sarah Stevens who is a marksman cum dexterous martial arts expert hired to protect the retired Judge Lowell. She foils a burglary in the Lowell's residence and her heroics are lauded in the media. It earns the unwanted attention of an obsessive stalker whose craze has manifested into her nightmare. Her employer is killed. Detective Thompson Cahill is enlisted into the investigation and soon finds himself struggling between duties and passion to Sarah....<br />Strong evocative characters have always been Howard's formula for success. Sarah is independent yet vulnerable with a mind of her own; Cahill is the delicious alpha male with a protective streak and wounded past in an unhappy marriage. Their romance is fueled by the scorching sex in Howard's imaginative sensual prose. <br />It could have been more if not for the spoiler in the author's acknowledgement where the murderer is revealed blatantly. There are some pulverizing suspense toawrds the climax yet never twisting enough to make it a stunner. Yet all is forgiven when the romance between Sarah and Thompson is oh-so-dying-to-please. It may not be Howard's best but Dying to Please places her in top-form again after her lackluster Open Season. For Howard's fans - this book is to die for.	2002-04-28

She protects herself with tools, her cans of spray mousse and electronic toy that spouts quotes from movies and her only connection to her former world is a handphone. Ian Ross is piqued by this woman who claims to be Kathy of Hair and seduces her to claim his mastery on women. Yet her presence makes him vulnerable. He shares an emotional connection and her refusal made him diginifed and not looked upon as a sex-slave. <br />There is fun and comedy yet to last a novel of 300 pages long is insufficient - the first part of the story comes desperately thin and easily forgettable. The sex though is hot and passionate cannot cover the shallow tale with its lack of development. It is thus fortunate that Kathy and Ian are both appealing characters with their cluelessness and cynicism. The PLEASURE MASTER can only be a fleeting shallow pleasure at its best.	2002-04-10

Ladd Dasheroon and Laurette Howard both from distinguished Southern families are torn apart when Ladd is conscripted to the Confederacy to fight the Union. Captured and exiled by the Northern soldiers to the Devil Castle, he survives the bitter imprisonment with hopes of returning back to Laurette. When his best friend Jimmy Tiggart now a major is posted to Devil Castle, his hopes of escape is revived. Little did he know that Jimmy has set his eyes on Laurette. He collaborated with LaKid, the supervisor to banish him to the heathens and lies to Laurette that he is dead as a prisoner of war. The betrayal is seething. The devastating news of Laurette's marriage to Jimmy extinguished his hope for life. <br />He desires revenge and fate intends for him to befriend Finis Schaefer, a benefactor who taught him arts and culture and passed him a map to hidden gold he stole. When he escapes, he returns to Mobile as Sutton Vane to seek revenge on Jimmy and ultimately his sweetheart who hurt him the most - Laurette....<br />THE SCANDALOUS MISS HOWARD sounds risque for a love drama set in the throes of war, yet the languid sensuality scorches with its passionate scenes and seduction. Nan Ryan smoothly intertwines the mechanisms of factual political intrigue and war to give credibility to her romance. However the part on his imprisonment and escape bears an uncanny resemblance to Alexandra Duma's The Count of Monte Cristo and hence its originality suffers. <br />Nan Ryan delivers a romance packed with emotions and seething betrayal as usual but it cannot be compared to her 1996 romance, You Belong To My Heart of a similar theme which boasts more developed characters and gratifying story-line. THE SCANDALOUS MISS HOWARD is nonetheless an enjoyable treat from Ms. Ryan who pens a scorching hot read.	2002-04-10

Sandra Brown's latest hardcover A KISS REMEMBERED billed as a classic love story should be released into a paperback given that it is firstly too short and ungratifying in terms of price against quality and secondly a dated re-release of her work when she writes under the pseudonym of Erin St. Clare.<br />Not that the story itself is insipid. Sandra Brown is a master at crafting moral dilemmas and poignant romance. This time round she weaves a student-teacher romance between Shelley Browning and Grant Chapman. Once at Poshman Valley High when Shelley was a budding student worshipping the devastatingly handsome political science teacher Mr. Chapman until a shocking yet pleasantly intimate kiss fuelled their desire. Confusion propels Shelley to distance herself and run straight into the arms of Daryl Robins, who later she discovered was a erroneous choice for a husband with his selfishness. Grant moved on to the political stage as a senatorial aide but later a scandal exploded to revert him to teaching yet again.<br />When they meet again it is at a church-sponsored university where Shelley studies as an undergraduate and Grant as the professor. A wiser and matured Shelley finds her grappling with the primal attraction to Grant, yet again public opinion and objections from the school chancellor threatens their rekindle of romance. When love comes heading, Shelley is forced to evaluate her option and apprehend her fears in love. Most importantly of all, she has to learn to trust Grant....<br />The awkward relationship under Ms. Brown comes maturedly handled without eager prurience - and it is all the more miraculous she can explore and develop their passion within 180 pages. The hardship and hurdles to surmount manifest as ostracization, gossips that threatens Grant's career, political scandals and Shelley's selfish ex-husband. It makes their precarious May-December romance all the more rewarding and triumphant. The love scenes are uniquely Brown's passionate prose and they sizzle. However, it is ultimately Ms. Brown's high-voltage emotional drama that renders her one of the most profilic author today and also one romance writer who is fondly remembered for her optimistic and uplifting romance.	2002-04-10

ANGEL FACE as her latest work involves Dr. Jordan Carpenter who gets entangled with a killer Angel Face. He is informed by CIA agent Edwin Truitt that he is deemed the next target by the lust murderer who has slained off other doctors. She is rumoured to be disturbed from her abused past and entices her prey with her innocence. Angela Lowe works at SmartTech a researching company who specializes in its invention of a system that taps into the mind of violent serial killer. Haunted by fragments of her pasts, she decides to piece them out through Jordan who is cautious of her begiling identity as Angel Face....<br />ANGEL FACE lacks the credibility to fuel its suspense. Her knowledge of clinical psychology explodes and bombards the reader, taking him to several unnecessary plot twists. Though erotically titillating at times with the jungle scene between Jordan and Angela, the plot tends to be confusing and ends up in a sputtering mess even to the point when the explanation is done. As such the reader is busy figuring out the plot rather than focusing his attention on Jordan and Angela.<br />It tries to be avant-garde but the contrived twists make ANGEL FACE confusing and absurd to even consider this read angelic. Forster's penchance for building erotic tension is thus a wasted effort here to bolster the romance. ANGEL FACE could have been so much more.	2002-04-06

She prepares herself for the firing of one of her father's employed manager at his Whistledown establishment. Joe Welch runs his stable and has dreams of bringing his fine horses to tournaments but they are shattered. His livelihood along with his son Eli and daughter Jenny is threatened and he blames it on Alex. <br />Yet their chemistry cannot be denied and when the killer who claimed her father returns for her, Alex has no choice but to reach for safety in the arms of Joe. When stunning relevations about Joe's long-lost wife are made and Alex's sister Neely together with Eli has disappeared, the danger becomes more treacherous than ever....<br />Karen Robard's contemporary romance is hot and sexy with Joe and Alex but the suspense leaves readers cold. It is contrived and unimaginative with cliches of chasing scene ripped off from a Scream horror movie. The pages can be skipped to the next hot sex outing because it is exactly the author's intention. The mystery is there to provide lame excuses to the passionate scenes and is embarrassingly distasteful. The killer's identity is hastily revealed and the motive is an insult to the intelligence of any mystery readers. It can be summarized in a page - so why have the mystery in the first place? It is made unneccessarily violent with the killer burning dogs and threatening young girls. <br />This book is vile and save for the chemistry between Alex and Joe, it rambles on without any clever plotting and leaves readers disappointed beyond words.	2002-03-31

She studies secretly in Barnard College to refrain from incurring the wrath of her mother and is socially active especially in the plans for the Police Department to eliminate rife corruption. <br />By chance of fate, she now takes on the role of a female sleuth to investigate the disappearance of Jonny Burton, a child of her neighbour who was mysteriously abducted. A series of notes and clues are sent. She joins forces with the new police commissioner, Rick Bragg to solve the crime and discovers that things aren't always what they seem....<br />Francesca Cahill is also the protagonist of Brenda Joyce's Deadly series to dabble in historical romanctic suspense. Deadly Love as the maiden book proves refreshing in the period of 1900 and is atmospheric in the description of New York's socialite. The mystery kidnapping itself isn't much of an intricate plot but the stunning revelations explores human foibles and crimes of passion which is rare in today's romances. The suspense is fast-paced and the chemistry between Bragg and Francesca crackles. Joyce succeeds in bringing out the complexity of her sub-characters like Connie, her sister and Neil, her sister-in-law through engaging sub-plots.<br />Though choppy at times and a rambling mystery yarn, Brenda Joyce is laudable for her humane portrayal of her characters and her penchance for historical details. It offers some high-voltage drama and grit at times and DEADLY LOVE is an auspicious start to her new series.	2002-03-31

He happens to be the father of Calder Hart, who arrives as her love-interest Police Commissioner Bragg's half-brother.<br />While the focus of Deadly Pleasure was to solve the who-dun-it, the book is even more notable for the sub-plots and characters which are shamelessly dramatic and complex. Joyce continues her style of unraveling stunning secrets about the Cahill family and Bragg. There is the struggle of her sister Connie to grip with the disclosure of her husband Neil's infidelity; there is her brother Evan's dalliance with her mistress despite his engagement to a fiancee; there is the rivalry of Calder Hart and Bragg to pump our adrenaline in their feud. The romance between the central character Francesca and Bragg is left hanging with new obstacles. <br />As such the mystery takes a backseat but nonetheless an interesting diversion to the drama at hand. The mystery is straightforward without any delicate intricacies or intrigue and Francesca amuses and annoys simultaneously with her naivete and cluelessness, even sometimes to plain stupidity. Her courage is nevertheless admirable in the confined New York conservative society and Joyce really is a master at reconstructing the glamorous socialite in 1902 with her observant eye. <br />DEADLY PLEASURE can never seem to break the mold in scripting good suspense and romance combined. Both elements are unsatisfyingly developed given the length of the novel. It is entertaining though for the wonderful subplots and sub-characters in their own dilemmas. It remains uneven at its best but constantly readable though for Joyce's powerful narrative.	2002-03-31

For Nell Dysart it's a painful eighteen years after her husband Tim abandoned her for his secretary Whitney. It is a seething betrayal when she has helped his insurance firm flourish and loved him faithfully. Her sister, Suze Dysart is no better - she finds herself in a dilemma of being a suppressed wife or a \\"child bride\\" where her every decision is masterminded by Jack, her husband. Nell decides to start afresh when she seeks employment in McKenna's Investigation agency. The owner Gabe McKenna is disturbingly attractive and his cousin Riley is a sexy flirt. Their investigation varies from checking out on infidelities and secret threats to organization. When Nell chance upon a document hinting that Gabe's father Patrick secrets some diamonds, she has no idea that she is on the trail of solving a mystery of mayhem and sabotage....<br />Jennifer Crusie's latest full-length novel is a breezy fast read laced with sardonic humour and quirky relationships. The tightly woven mystery aside, Fast Women is a light parody and social commentary on the trials of women today. The stories link trophy wives, hidden desires and fear of marriages to translate the insecurities grappled by women nowadays. Nell and Suze adapt and mature under a series of events to summon their courage and find their true-love eventually. <br />FAST WOMEN is irreverent and tenderly touching in conveying the turmoils of Nell as a mother and as a woman to embrace love yet again. Its refreshing humour and wicked sarcasm is scathing; the mystery and adventures of finding dead corpse in freezers and diamonds in sofa are fun and absurd. It is delightfully exuberant and energetic given the explosive chemistry between Gabe and Nell - so much so that it is deservingly ranked Best of 2001 by Amazon editors. I urge you to grab this book - fast.	2002-03-27

Heath swore revenge, kidnaps Raven and his nemesis but sets him free with Raven's intervention. She is not convinced that Heath is his soulmate despite her erotic dreams and her Celtic roots that call out to her. The passion between them accelerates with Heath's chivalry in her rescue and his loyalty to the Scottish clan. Raven falls head over heels in love with this protective man who claims her as his own. However, political treachery comes in the way when Raven becomes a pawn in the deadly game masterminded by her betrothed....<br />THE BORDER HOSTAGE is bawdy lust and highland romance at its finest despite the tangible flaw in the loose plot binding the 400 pages . The characters are scripted to finesse with their emotions afire, yet the intrigue and murder plot can never sustain the interest with its thin content. It is predictible but it is the fascination with the starstruck couple that holds us arrested.	2002-03-22

Tired of the bloodshed, his wish for a land, wife and a stable life was realized when King George and Lord Pelham conferred him the title of Lord Clarendon, Master of Misterly. It comes with an agreement to prevent the marriage between Tavis Gordon and Elissa Fraser which would unite two strong clans in the highlands and pose a threat to the English rule. <br />Things get complicated when he is attracted to the feisty lass, Elissa who despises Damian with his murder of her father.

Grace's compassion transforms into a healing power that magnifies into love, and when the god of lust Eros informs her that the way to dispel the curse is to resist temptation and come together as one in the next-full moon, she is tenacious to save him but could he be willing to salvage himself?<br />FANTASY LOVER is a buoyant read fuelled by a relentless imagination that captures beautifully the fascinating myths and legends of Greek warriors and gods like the mighty Zeus, love-god Aphrodite, cupid and Psyche. The dramatic revenge, human foibles of envy and pride spun in Julian's tale gives the story substance. It gentles into a romance that brings hope and redemption with Grace as the healer who is intelligent and dignified enough to resist lust and teaches love. Sherrilyn Kenyon is definitely a stellar talent with her celestial tale and sensual powers to mesmerize and provoke imagination.

It is regally atmospheric with rich historical tapestry on Englands high classes and ghoulish in its scope on holocaust in Waterloo waged by Napoleon.<BR> The mystery ends with an unlikely saviour. As if to give the historical part a conclusive chapter, Ms. Foley engages the charactersinto the French battle where a historical note would suffice.

The central protagonist in LORD OF FIRE is shrewd British spy Lucien Knight who is hot on the trail of Claude Bardou who is bent on terrorizing the heart of England with his rumoured attempt to save the exiled Napolean in Elba. Their feud stretches more than that when months ago Lucien was captured and tortured by him - and a careless whisper of his mentor's name had led Claude to silence him. Using orgy parties in his decadent Revell Court as a guise for information tracking, Lucien assumes the notorious reputation of a rake. He traps the flirtatious Lady Glenwood, Caro sexually to keep Damien from jumping into marriage with the wrong woman. Alice Montague, her sister-in-law can no longer see Caro neglecting her sickly son Harry and comes to Revell Court to sought her out. She meets Lucien in person and her heart is tempted by his debonair nature and devastating good looks. <br />The attraction jerks Lucien and disturbs him even more when Alice touches him with her exuberance and affection. She haunts him in his dreams with her profound words on love and enlightening maturity. Lucien keeps her in Revell Court against her will and a week of confinement with him turns miraculously into an exploration of vulnerable hearts and soul. He confesses his inferior complexity towards his brother Damien and finds himself marooned in despair when his espionage career sworns him into secrecy. Yet a even greater danger lurks when Claude hunts him down along with Alice....<br />LORD OF FIRE attempts to be stupendous with intricate plot-lines running on a cat-and-mouse game of treachery and espionage. Napolean's exile in Elba, the fascinating details of Bow Street and Guy Fawkes adds realism into Ms. Foley's masterful descriptions and her penchance for creating atmosphere. There is suspense and thrills which culminates in the climax when Claude and Lucien embarks in a ferocious chase. Its strength however backfires to bring out its weakness too. While Alice Montague and Lucien Knight are very endearing characters, their romance are somewhat stifled by the grand historical stage and sketchy characters like Caro. <br />Ms. Foley is in her element when Alice and Lucien are together, engaging in poignant conversation and fierce lovemaking. Yet these moments are all too rare especially with its heavy 404 pages. It is all the more frustrating when Lucien Knight and Alice are such potential characters who could have been developed more thoroughly like Robert and Bel in THE DUKE. The overblown plot could be trimmed to have allowed more room into character growth. LORD OF FIRE sizzles and smolders with a regal sensuality and intrigue but it lacks the explosive impact between her protagonists to create a real blazer.	2002-02-17

Shouldn't Nick be more familiar with contraceptive methods than Sara who initiated it? Dspite some minor flaws, THE SEDUCTION OF SARA still manages to captivate.	2002-02-03

The plot centres around grisly serial killings of prostitutes milling around Boston alleys and the victims are marked by an imprint of a nightingale. Lucas Hawthorne, the heart-throb and notorious rake who opens the Nightingale Gentleman's club is the prime suspect. The commonwealth prosecutor, Walker Kendall is determined to send him to the gallows. Grey, his brother has the foresight to engage him Alice Kendall, who is Walker's daughter. She is spurred by her father's lack of confidence in her to win the courtcase. <br />As investigation continues, more facts are revealed to piece out the puzzle. Linda Francis Lee throws in some delicious red herrings and prime suspects including Alice's father, Clark - her father's protege and prosecuting lawyer, Bradford Hawthorne -Luca's father. The mystery is spine-tingling and dark given the decadence of the Boston underground. Yet the courtroom drama's magentism cannot be compared to the triumph of passion between Alice and Lucas. Lucas is a brooding hero who despite being the owner of the scandalous club, is a man tormented by the loss of his innocence and a former lover. Alice is capable as the female lawyer who shows courage in her job and her righteousness and intelligence is worthy of emulation. The professional relationship is soon overwhelmed by emotions and desire, yet the question of whether Lucas is the killer hangs in the balance.<br />Nightingale's Gate is Linda Francis Lee's most solid effort so far in the trilogy after Dove's Way and Swan's Grace. It soars with an emotional and heart-rendering finale and the propulsive intrigue is galvanizing and gritty to keep you awake throughout the night. Already selected by Amazon.com's editors as one of the top ten historical romance in 2001, this book is a high-flyer with reviewers. It is a gem waiting to be unearthed by astute readers.	2002-02-02

Spurred by his sexual instincts, he confronts Tamara and discovers she is to relocate her shop due to a series of sabotages. Her uncle Thanos and supersitious aunties Eva and Olga suggests they are acts from the late Uncle Hubert whose life was claimed by a typhoon while relieving himself at a makeshift toilet. Zane with his chivalrous nature swears to protect Tamara and even hires his cousin Joe to guard her without her knowledge. Love strikes when Zane finds that Tamara is a woman of passion whose resilience is a mold from her independent childhood. She dares to quibble and is stubborn. Their love progresses with the aid of an erotic journal from an unknown which might hold the key to the mystery behind the sabotages....<br />You have to admit the story-line is clinically thin - and even to the point of absurdity when the motive behind the disturbance is unraveled. Yet Lori Foster holds a certain endearing charm with her characters in ridiculous situations that are rib-tickling. Zane Winston and Tamara sizzle and crackle in their sexual awakening; their romance is a sexy and rambunctious escapade that knits your heart close to them. Zane beyond his wild persona is sensitive and one who adores children; he is loyal to his brothers and family akin. Tamara is not the wild gypsy too - what lies underneath is responsibility and maturity in appreciating her only relatives.<br />It is with such fabulous characters that no matter how filmsy the subplot is, WILD still manages to be wildly entertaining with its brand of sexist humour and innuendoes. With WILD as the last book on the winning Winston brothers, an endearing camaderie with the family is long fostered between the readers and them.	2002-02-01

Dallas has embarked on an undercover mission to bust a white slavery syndicate for two years - and he isn't prepared to let Tess foil his plans. He is forced to kidnap her and make her his amorous lover when one of the vile gang-member, Snake advances on her. <br />Yet the greater surprise is the undeniable attraction that charges between them despite the charade. Tess wants her freedom desperately but is denied by Dallas who swore to protect her life. Their frustration is even intensified by their passionate nature - and in one night of reckless passion, their lives are intertwined. Complicated by Tess's pregnancy and the case far from over, Dallas is in for a hard time grappling both. Even more so when Tess knows zilch about Dallas's identity. Could this romance be a farce with duty at stake?<br />LONE RIDER is Lauren Bach's maiden debut and the galvanizing action and sizzling passion rivals that of masters Linda Howard and Cherry Adair. It departs from the mainstream novels nowadays when it brings in the issue of pregnancy after unprotected sex. Dallas Haynes as the suave male protagonist braves through Tess's ordeal as a hostage, an abandoned soul and as a mother makes him endearingly affectionate. He is flawed and honest when he speaks about the failure of his former marriage and his selfishness in culminating the break. The readers are swept into a maelstrom of desire and emotions with Bach's focused writing. No doubt the story plot revolves around the tried-and-use formula of cracking down a sex syndicate, LONE RIDER offers some palpable thrills and grit at times. A first-timer at hand, Lauren Bach's hot shot debut rides towards a golden strike with its wild passion.	2002-01-26

A rendezvous with the prince is abruptly foiled by an assassination where Jocelyn is rescued by a spy, Rand, Viscount of Beaumont. Their fateful meeting is sealed with a kiss to silence her shrieks on witnessing the account. Their meeting is hostile and even complicated by her aunt's decision to marry her off to Rand in order to protect her from attempts to silence her off.<br />As Jocelyn becomes the unwilling bride, she is shakened by passion and captivated by Rand. Despite her donning glasses, Rand commented on her intelligence and wits rather than beauty. Just as their love intensifies, Prince Alexei persuades her to come to Avalon in order to bait Rand to restore power to the crumbling kingdom when a mutiny is tearing the hierachy apart. Little did she know Prince Alexei is Rand's cousin. Jocelyn finds herself unable to reconcile with the fact she has married a real prince....<br />The Prince's Bride may be a royal treat to her fans enchanted to her witty banters and grand passion, yet it definitely lacks the momentum to keep Ms. Alexander in her throne. For the first half of the book, it drones on with Jocelyn and Rand struggling to keep their passion at bay. The later part slightly improves with a political dimension thrown in to make the book more adventurous besides romance. It is a hasty effort from Ms. Alexander without much depth and the book's predictibility renders it disappointing. A princely price to pay in terms of quality over quantity - Ms. Alexander obviously needs time to recharge with her fast release of her novels.	2002-01-19

Dr. Joanna Schell is the psychiatrist for the inhabitants and she is tenacious to make hypnotism flourish as a healing tool. She carries on from where her apoplexy-strickened father Wilheim has left off. An unexpected encounter with the injured and inebriated Quentin Foster brings him to The Haven to receive treatment for his wounded body and soul. Quentin's secret as a werewolf is concealed. Joanna is intrigued by him - and even more so for his dimensions and magentism in interacting with the inhabitants here. Harper, a veteran scarred by the war carnage shares the same fate with the war-tormented Quentin; May shrugs off her repulsion towards the opposite gender.<br />Soon their doctor-relationship explodes into a deeper attachment and the peace of the Haven is threatened by a doctor called Feouder Bolvonsky who is here to reclaim May to her sexually abusive father. Quentin is determined to stop this and his aggression may once again lead him into killing. A deadly deception lies ahead and The Haven will depend on Joanna's love to tame Quentin and rekindle his hope in humanity....<br />Susan Krinard's SECRET OF THE WOLF forms the trilogy in her paranormal series after ONCE A WOLF and TOUCH OF THE WOLF. This effort is to date her most dazzling showcase in spinning a romantic tale that is emotionally gripping and detailed with medical researches. It explores the savage side of humankind with Quentin's multiple personality disorder and engages sympathy for the discriminated Oscar with his mental illness. The complication of science and humanity makes an interesting stage; the ficitional romance and adventure is soaring. Yet what makes SECRET OF THE WOLF her most accomplished so far is the savage tenderness in Quentin and his struggle with his childhood abuse by his grandfather. A race threatened by extinction, Quentin is programmed to be a primitive killing machine to sustain the power of the wolf population. How Joanna manages to exonerate his guilt and tragedy with her power of love is poignantly touching. <br />Susan Krinard's latest is beyond categorization. The complexity of the story is handled with finesse and spiced up by her absorbing style of narration and description. Her talents in crafting an exciting werewolf read should be no secret by now.	2002-01-19

An abrupt historical release from the primed contemporary romance queen firstly makes it a departure difficult for them to accept, let alone being embarrassed by the association with a literary classic GONE With the Wind. <br />Indeed Susan Elizabeth Phillips' latest has its fair share of glory. Using the Civil War and the struggle of the South and North as backdrop, she tells of a Southern lass, Kit Weston plotting murder on her Yankee guardian Baron Cain to reclaim her precious Risen Glory estate that is everything to her including Sophronia, her loyal maid. She is mistaken for a stable boy and is hired to serve Cain, which later when her identity is exposed, he threatens to sell away her estate if she refuses to enter an Academy for ladies. Years passed, Kit's vendetta with Cain is unsettled. As she matures into a woman, Cain is unexpectedly drawn to her and yields her into marriage. However, their pride will leave them at loggerheads. There is no fundamental love in their marriage institution - only desire. Cain, who is scared that he will end up like his father being taken advantage of by his mother sees Kit clinging onto him because of responsibilities - and not love. Though painful, their separation is imminent and inevitable for their stubborn hearts.<br />JUST IMAGINE attempts to stage a grand historical romance with slavery, clashes and racism. Yet the romance element is never quite fulfiling - Kit's wilfulness has made it difficult for any communication. Their departure in the middle of the book left them undeveloped and dry. Furthermore their love being contrived seemed pretentious and severed of emotions. Philips creates Kit to be strong and independent, yet simultaneously childish for her myopic view to be Cain's mistress in order to get back her estate. By the time she matures towards the epilogue, it seemed their love too late for redemption. The get-together far too hasty and unbelievable. In fact her secondary characters like Magnus and Sophronia shines luminously. Theirs is a love triumphed against discrimination - and how Sophronia convinces herself that Magnus is able to protect her with his love.<br />It is remarkable that historical accuracies are there but it unfortunately languishes into a dry read with undeveloped main characters and the passion is never quite on par with the throes of war. It leaves us only to imagine how ever could this book lack the sweeping passion that GONE WITH THE WIND has enchanted us with when the two are said to be in comparison.	2002-01-11

The romantic regency comedy takes place in Hampshire where Duke of Wycliffe, Lord Greydon Brackenridge is stunned by his fascination with Emma Grenville, the prim-and-oh-so-proper headmistress of Miss Grenvilles's Academy which launches young ladies into the society. When Wycliffe's uncle Peyton encounters a financial doldrum, he suggests tripling the rents of the Academy to maintain his uncle's estate. Emma with her tightened purse strings obviously objects, and in the midst of a heated arguement, agreed to a bet where she will manage the estate of his uncle and he will coach the ladies. <br />Just when Wycliffe dismisses the school as teaching the girls ways to bait husbands, he is in for a surprise. He becomes the student when the innocent young maids indoctrinates him on respect for a woman and simple values like honesty. To exacerbate situations, his fantasies and unfathomable adoration for Emma becomes real. The school is soon rocked by a scandal. Emma has to choose between reputation for the school and a true abiding passion....<br />Ms. Enoch's latest while blemished by an abrupt epilogue is rescued by the hilarious mood ubiquitous in the novella. Tristan Dare makes a good secondary character with his amusing antics and the wry humour of Wycliffe and Emma spices up their flaming passions. It goes to show that this book's greatest strength is not merely a matter of delicious scandal but a robust duel of intelligence and wits.	2002-01-05

It all crumbles with the arrival of her unexpected partner J.D Carver, who inherits his share of the property from Great Aunt Edwina. Her aunt Sophie and Uncle Ben has done some snooping and finds out that J.D has a rough past toughing out on the streets. There will naturally be some friction what with J.D's paranoia about the ardent Lawrence gang - but what he fails to anticipate is the spark of attraction towards Dru. The banters and sexual innuendoes are enough to drive him crazy but not enough to abandon his logic. The betrayal in his past makes him retreat from love; the Disney-que family warmth enshrouding him since he arrived makes him cringe with cyncism. It is a life that he has sworn off with his sordid past. Dru realizes that J.D is the man for her and she is determined not to let him go, however when a sabotage endangers the Lawrence clan, J.D believes he is responsible for bringing them here, he is all the more disillusioned and believes that leaving Dru might be the best option for them....<br />You may wonder why Susan Andersen's latest is a sensation as a top pick for RT and Amazon editors with its uninspired story plot. It is straight-forward storytelling with delicious chemistry between the studly, muscle-bound J.D and the sassy Dru. Yet its unpretentiousness and honest emotions may shook you raw - J.D's reservations towards the kindness stems from an insidious betrayal where Aunt Edwina accused him wrongly of a theft. In the later part of the novel, he finds himself too impetuous, unheeding of edwina's apologies. His pride and tenderness makes him an endearing hero. Dru's initiative in taking her own happiness into hands is refreshingly independent and laudable. She is not afraid of getting scarred, so long as she convinces J.D of her love. Their love is a triumph especially when J.D undergoes an agonizing lesson of accountability and letting someone to brave the storms together. <br />The charms of witty quips and sexy banters aside, ALL SHOOK UP strums with heartfelt passion between flawed characters. No doubt the storyplot is obsolete, but for a romantic comedy, it shakes the readers up with enlightening maturity on simple values of responsibility and forgiveness. The exquisite tenderness in the epilogue is an emotional rollercoaster ride. It will send you tremors even in its aftermath - and it's that good.	2002-01-05

It was on that fateful night he realized his attraction for Mimi Marsh, the daughter of renowned sculptor Sir Harold Marsh - and the astonishing disappearance of the fossils at the unveiling ceremony. His reputation is ruined overnight. After being reclusive for 2 years, he is back with a vengeance - to get Mimi to sculpt a replica of the fossils which will launch his career again and to find out the true culprit behind his downfall. As love blossoms again for Mimi aka Widow Sinclair, it is Nathan's arrogance and pride that will impede love's course. Even more so when he has reasons to believe Mimi may be the ultimate culprit with her deceptions....<br />True enough, SOMEONE IRRESISTIBLE is non pareil to Ms. Ashworth's magnificent previous outing WINTER GARDEN. It lacks the usual finesse and nuance in emotive depth common in her books. However it is not without its merits - both Nathan and Mimi are flawed characters and honest to their emotions. Mimi's revelation about her feelings for Nathan despite her marriage and Nathan's bigotry are foibles that made them humane and real. The romance between a dinosaur paleontologist and sculptor is a refreshing novelty. The passion in her bold strokes is sizzling and smoldering fuelled by Mimi's sexual reawakening. The front pages may not be well-developed but the final pages when the mystery is revealed deals a graceful coup de grace with its unexpected twist that brims with hidden truths. A daughter's love and Mimi's maturity are what makes Someone irresistible a cut above the rest. No doubt first time readers of Adele Ashworth will be captivated, but as for her fans her offering marks some disappointment though. Yet all is not lost - it is only because we have witnessed her mastery in producing books that are truly dazzling. This novella is arresting but certainly does not measure up to irresistible.	2002-01-01

She speaks of this town where gossips are rampant as wildfire; and it absolves itself from any blame of ozone pollution by pointing the finger towards California. Where alien abductions are speculated. A perfect place for LA-based tabloid reporter Hope Spencer with her writer's block. When she enters the town with the amusingly-plated MZBHAVN Porsche, struts with her blue Tony Lamas boots and Ray-Ban, she is in for a culture-shock. She wonders whether she is the only one sane in the town where people eats steer's testicles. Her designated lodgings at the Donelly's is rumoured to be a suicidal venue for the former owner. <br />Yet there are blessings in disguise too. Like in the form of drop-dead gorgeous Sheriff Dylan Taber who with his emerald gaze and antics make her feel desirable again. Like her next-door neighbours Paul and Shelley who are unpretentiously amicable. She feels genuinely happy and uninhibited with the simple people here, with whom she casts away her reservations except for the fact she is with the tabloids. <br />Before romance can take flight, Hope finds herself confronting her insecurities - as a woman who indelibly becomes infertile with her hysterectomy and her failed marriage with a plastic surgeon who had an affair with her best friend. Dylan has some confessions to make - Adam is an illegitmate child of his and famous soap drama queen Julie Bancroft. When the dark secret surprisingly spreads to the tabloids, Dylan suspects Hope - and soon their tenuous relationship festers. <br />Ms. Gibson's TRUE CONFESSIONis an utter bliss brimming with wits and exuberant romance. There is tender poignancy especially where Dylan and Adam is concerned; he being overprotective of Adam, elucidating the whole birds and bees business to his son. His paternal love shows when he moved from LA to Gospel for his son after being shakened by an infanticide. The desire between Hope and Dylan is smoldering and passionate - you will never view cakes in the same way after reading. Their love has to be fortified with trials on trusts and communication. <br />A breezy, feel-good piece of solid entertainment that bubbles with love and joy - Ms. Gibson has successfully outdone herself. Never before in her past novels like IT MUST BE LOVE or SIMPLY IRRESISTIBLE has she spawned small-town romances with such intricacies and details on the rustic life. That leaves only one thing for me to confess in the whole gospel truth - it's heavenly.	2001-12-29

Especially the inchoate tale penned by Cathy Maxwell where it tells of Graham McNab who aspires to be a physician makes a bet with his malicious cousin to win the heart of his amorous target a Ms. Lucy Whitlaw. Being tone-deaf, he has difficulty mastering dancing and he seeks tutelage from best friend Sarah, who has long been in love with him.Sadly underdeveloped characters fail to attract readers. Ms. Maxwell has seemed to abandon the theme and doesn't give any insight of romance couples with age gap.<br />Lauren Royal's tale of Forevermore is simple and average. It tells of Clarice Bradford overcoming the fears of loving a younger man Cameron Leslie. She is split between duties and passion. Jaclyn Reding fares better with a Scottish tale where Harriet Drynan decides between a curse and love for childhood sweetheart Tristan Carmicheal. A leap year might prove a magical solution; the story is rescued by Reding's input of fairy tales and mythic aura. <br />JO BEVERLEY's The Demon Mistress makes the other stories look juvenile in comparison. It is poignant, exquisitely sensual and stays relevant to the theme. It tells of this widow Maria Celestin who tries to convert the profligate Vandermein. She sees it an obligation to undo the hurt her demised husband has inflicted on Van. With a promise to finance his debts, on the condition he be her fiance for a period of six weeks - they experience a shower of passion and love this short time. The flawed Van scarred by war and loss of kinship and friends sees a chance of redemption. He covets the love Maria withholds for his sake - the public ostracizing over their age gap will pose a barrier to them. <BR>  <BR>IN PRAISE OF YOUNGER MAN is bolstered solely on Jo Beverley's marvellous contribution.

It's a grisly hangman game played in a reverse way, where victims are disembowelled and mutilated as the Special X force of the police comprising of The MOUNTIES and Seattle Cops unravel the riddle. Inspector Zinc Chandler and cop Maddie Thorne race against the time to uncover the mystery and links it to the hanging of Peter Bryce Haddon, a child abuser who claims he is innocent. They discover that the victims are intrinsically related to the jury who finds Haddon guilty - yet time races against them when red herrings are thrown. Even more so when they find the murderer is so close to them.....<br />As a first time reader of Michael Slade's X psychotic thrillers, I am impressed and even fascinated by the macabre horror jay Clarke and his daughter Rebecca conjured out. HANGMAN for all its childish antics to earn humour, is meticulously detailed and well-researched. The killings narrated in such visceral prose leaves a shudder and the courtroom drama is propulsive action. It is gripping and satirical. Slade combines a high octane who-dun-it mystery with vivid details of hanging style, research on Munch's The Scream and slyly scorns the law with its loopholes. It raises questions on justice, the balance of morals, ethics with law in stories. The protagonists Zinc and Maddie are flawed and beliveable; and the twist and turns are unpredictible.<br />HANGMAN is an enriching read. It thrills and taunts with terror, and the courtroom scenes are written with gusto given the experience of Jay Clarke as a professional lawyer. It has a style that is unique - a hybrid of true realism and fiction. Despite some parts of the story overstuffed with quotations and the plot haphazardly runs amok, it is a clever read. It lets you get the hang of playing along with the game, then seizes you with pulsating horror and wicked humour.	2001-12-21

The new players are seasoned writers - with popular names like Lori Foster, Suzanne Foster and queen of erotic romance Thea Devine leading the pack as well as sprouting talent Shannon McKenna. It is primed to repeat its success as its predecessor.<br />Yet the consistency of the stories is not as fortified as in Captivated and Fascinated. Suzanne Foster surprisingly after a slew of misfires in her contemporary romances returns exaltedly to the top of the game with STRANGER IN HER BED. Her protagonist, Kerry Houston is a recluse and a game tester for Genesis Software company - and when the virtual hero Jean manifests himself in reality - she is drawn irresistibly to him. The spark of fantasy, romance and mystery in this original work holds a certain enchantment. Kerry's vulnerability and how Jean helped her to overcome her social phobia and opened her heart to a greater territory of love are narrated with Ms. Foster's focused writing. It is sensual and fuelled with escapism - yet miracles can happen when love conquers all. <br />Thea Devine, despite her established throne as the queen of romance, seems atrophied with her story &quot;No Mercy&quot;. It is a tried and used formula of ex-husband Bobby returning to stake his claim on his wife, Regan. The sex is graphic. The urgency of Bobby to claim his wife with sex seemed unappealing and even to the point of dangerous obsession. No points for the originality of the story either.<br />Lori Foster and Shannon McKenna fortunately rescues the anthology to inject a dose of humour and poignancy respectively. Ms. Foster's Satisfy Me is an intriguing tale of how a sex shop opening in the conservative Cuthers can unite Asia Michaels and Cameron O'Reilly together indirectly. A desultory conversation on fantasies and even spanking lead to a misunderstanding fromAsia's admirer, Cameron - who thought she was into kinky sex. How wrong they were when passion and chemistry paved way. Shannon McKenna's Something Wild is perhaps the strongest story. Truly a fine gem of charged eroticity weaved with poignancy. Annie Simon leads a wandering life after her failed marriage to Philips and when Jacob Kerr knocks her over with his gorgeous bod and charisma, she is afraid to risk her heart again. She questions the fine line between fantasies and reality. Their passion appeals to the reader's senses and is smoldering and sexy. It is a story that sweeps reader into a maelstrom of reckless desire and questioning sanity simultaneously. <br />ALL THROUGH The NIGHT brings a new dimension to eroticity and romance with the contemporary scene. Sex toys, virtual cybersex are introduced, yet the theme of love and romance still etches deep within the stories. Not as unforgettable and nuanced as CAPTIVATED, but just as enchanting. It remains undiminished as an erotic anthology to open a brave, new world for romance.	2001-12-16

It is darker, more emotional and poignant. <br />Gray Sinclair, after being thrown off-course from his intended destination, the Azores Islands in quest of The Sacred Heart - a red diamond, in a surprising turn of events, becomes convicted of murder of Sarah - a local towngirl in the Socttish coast. Bonnie MacTavish, the fierce and proud clanswoman is determined to bring him to justice. Yet Bonnie discovers she may have wronged Gray when she sees his merits beneath his juvenile appearance. Just when her heart softens, Gray holds her hostage to get back to his ship (ironcally named Revenge) - and they embark on an adventure to find the coveted stone.<br />There is intrigue and drama. Clansman rivalry, betrayal and a spiteful mother who lies to her son on his bastard identity. Gray believes himself to be unworthy of his brother's affection with his shameful secret; he is scared of being a dreamer and giving love. It is up to Bonnie to convert him - yet the way is a path of thorns but the triumph of two united hearts is indeed rejoicing. The most haunting part is when Gray recognizes the extent of his love for Bonnie when she is nearly outraged by a savage warrior on the island. <br />Melanie George matures from the casual mood from Handsome Devil and Devil may care to pen a darker devil's due. While her hilarious tone falters, THE DEVIL's DUE is a solid piece of swashbuckling entertainment. Its romance tinged with a bittersweet tone with misgivings and forgiveness warrants an arresting read especially during Christmas. Some may fault her daredevil stunt at the third book for a change of style. Yet thereis absolutely no misgivings. This absorbing read is a blast.	2001-12-13

That was the last thing Duke of Tresham expected when he is fighting for his honor when wrongly accused of cuckolding Lord Oliver. Injured and incapacitated, Jocelyn points his anger towards Jane - and expects her to nurse him back to health. Which is perfectly fine - since that incident caused her to be late and sacked from her job. In their weeks of interaction, Jocelyn finds companionship and growing love for Jane. He reveals to her his deepest misery - how his father transformed his innocence into a ruthless profligate. Jane shows unexpected dimensions - her ethereal singing and wisdom, but she seems to be hiding something. She is under the pursuit of a Bow Street Runner for murder. When one month has passed and Jane is set on leaving, Jocelyn proposes to her to be his mistress....<br />Mary Balogh's regency romance shines with grace and fluid writing. The dialogue brims with wit - it is delightfully hilarious with Jane reprimanding Jocelyn's stubborn ways. Their chemistry sizzles; the sensuality is strong. Its strongest asset however, is Balogh's ability to manifest a character like Jane that charms with her maturity and wisdom. When Jocelyn relates his hatred for his father, it is with such pain and poignancy. She asks him to remember the happy times he shared with him. While this book is Balogh's most accomplished, the ends loses steam with the predictibility of the plot. If not for Balogh's charmed writing - it wouldn't be more than a mediocre read.	2001-11-25

However, the gothic element as summoned by the bookcover fails to permeate throughout the two stories. Especially so - when Christine Feehan with her immensely popular Dark series that is redolent of fantasies and gothic aura fails to create the magic in AFTER THE MUSIC. It is a contemporary romance that centres on the tragedy of Dillion Wentworth, a talented musician haunted by his mistakes in the past. A broken marriage to his ex-wife, a secret growing love for the ward, Jessica Fitzpatrick, and a fire that demolished his home, left him scarred and alienated to his children sums up his misery. Years later, after Jessica rescues his children from the inferno, she returns to find Dillion - cold and almost a stranger. She hopes for a Christmas miracle - that is to give Dillion the love of his children and gift of music. Yet a hideous murderer is determined to extinguish the hope.... In the desperation of danger, Dillion finds himself eager to protect his children and gathers the courage to face Jessica and his music again. AFTER THE MUSIC despite its lack of gothic flavor is saved by its taut suspense and tight romance. The fears and barriers Dillion and Jessica have to brave through is palpable - and their passionate romance is indeed a triumph. <br />Melanie George with Lady of the Locket surprisingly sheds the usual scintillating and humorous tone in her Devil's series to churn out a time-travel romance that is reminiscent of Lind Howard's Son of the morning. Rachel Hudson returns to the scottish castle Glengarron to bury the ashes of her demised parents, who met here several years ago. Her heartache and loneliness is devastating - even more so when she sees a portrait of a laird, Duncan MacGregor, who died as a patriot to his clan. On a stormy night when lightning strikes, she finds herself miraculously accosted by him who has stepped past a portal to her time. The chemistry between them is inexplicably strong and Rachel finds herself deeply entrenched in love. Yet their passion cannot fight against time and the relentless pursuit of an enemy..... Will a miracle happen?<br />Melanie George has succeeded in knitting an engaging read brimming with sensuality and passion. Rachel is vulnerable and Duncan's protectiveness is the perfect antitode to her pitiful existence. Lady of the Locket compared to AFTER THE MUSIC is richer in its gothic tone and more unforgettable. The quality of both romance in this anthology, A Very gothic Christmas is nevertheless superb; the romantic atmosphere is ubquitous and poignantly heartfelt.	2001-11-24

Deep in South America, Delanie Eastman braves high and low to locate her missing sister Lauren who was previously linked to the virulent drug-lord Ramon Montero. Assuming her dumb blonde persona, she enters the lion's den as Montero's interest. Little did she expect her plans to explode when Dr. Kyle Wright, her one-night stand years ago to appear as Montero's assassin. He has a secret agenda - to save the world from Montero's destructive plans in bioterrorism. Together Delanie and Kyle are gripped by treachery, propelled into present danger and even a frigid and emotional passion....<br />What action and high-flying passion! HIDE AND SEEK blends seamlessly propulsive drama and rollicking adventures as they survived through anacondas, piranhas, bugging devices and even the evil Isabella, a prostitution ringleader. Delanie is endearingly vulnerable yet a suitable candidate as Charlie's Angel with her ballet kicks. Kyle is a sexy and strong hero, fierce in his passion. Their chemistry is a exploding effervescence, especially in the sex department. HIDE AND SEEK is blazingly sensual and explicit. <br />In all its cloak of fast wits and cynical humour, HIDE and SEEK no doubt loses its predecessor's warmth and tenderness. Yet it reigns as this year's best contemporary romance so far. The heart-stopping action and steamy sex is enough to justify Ms. Adair's uncompromising talents in scripting a good read.	2001-11-15

It was love at first sight for Lucian when he spied on the luscious beauty at the Cornish beach and his life-threatening job as a British spy has fired his impulse to marry Brynn for her to bear him a son. Ironically Lucian got more than he had bargained for; Brynn was a temptress that gnawed at his passion and soul, and when he craved love from Brynn, she refused his offer because of a visceral atavistic fear that the gypsy curse would stake its claim on Lucian just like it did on her first love.<br />DESIRE, following the tradition of PASSION and the splendid SEDUCTION triumphs with sensual delights between Brynn and Lucian. The love scenes sizzles and scorches to a pulsating, dizzying beat. Intrigue takes a secondary seat with the subplot of a gold-smuggling contraband with Lucian as the investigator. As with any romance theirs is one overwrought with difficulties. Lucian has to learn to trust his wife and conquer his demons of having killed his betraying friend Giles. Brynn is caught in a dilemma between his smuggling brother, Gray and Lucian. <br />Ms. Jordan's bold and passionate style keeps DESIRE a smoldering read, but it lacks the poignant tenderness in THE SEDUCTION and propulsive intrigue in THE PASSION. New fans who savour heated historical romance will no doubt be enthralled, but those already mesmerized by her style from her earlier works will find it somehow lacking that spark of surprise. Ms. Jordan is such an engaging storyteller that DESIRE leaves the reader desiring for even more.	2001-11-14

Enters Professor Lili Kavanaugh who as a shoe creator is ridiculously harrassed and almost held captive in one of her lecture talks. Her life is threatened - and she is clueless to the motive behind. Her father hires this security specialist Matt Hawkins to protect Lilia and while Matt finds Lili attractive, he must fend off this chemistry to uphold his professionalism. A shootout unexpectedly brings them closer to the riddle; it is a pair of heels that Lili owns that holds the key. There is a tragedy behind where love, pride between thieves and honour interlaced. As they get to the bottom of the mystery, their attraction is undeniable - but can their romance overcome the surmounting barriers? Matt has to face his demon and reality - how could Lili ever be compatible with a rebel?<br />Michelle Jerott's latest is sheer escapism and fantasy - a shoe designer on the run is overstretched on reality furthermore the unconventional tale of G-man and gangsters runs on unfamiliar territory. Ms. Jerott's mystery element takes a backseat - even though the action in the shootout is masterfully paced. HER BODYGUARD is definitely vulnerable in its plot - what with the first part of the book describing all about Lili's fascination with heels and Matt's attraction. The secondary plot bridges in awkwardly. You cannot totally fault Ms. Jerott though - Shoes and G-man definitely sounds an uncompatible combination and surely few materials to research on. <br />The strength of the book bolsters on romance which Ms. Jerott has fortunately done extremely well. Matt is an irresistible hero and their sex steamy with a sexy kink. The emotions between the two of them wrestles on the complications of their jobs and pasts and is poignantly touching. Her memorable characters are fondly endearing and that's perhaps why readers cannot guard their hearts to the attraction towards Ms. Jerott's books.	2001-11-10

This book opens unabashedly with the character's confession, &quot;First you will laugh - later you will cry.&quot; Nicholas Sparks draws the reader to the town of Beaufort and spins a yarn about Lancer Carter, who at the age of seventeen learns about the true love and miracles of God through his fateful encounter with the local minister's daughter Jamie Sullivan. He is intrigued by how gregarious and cheerful she remains, and together in a drama play - he learns of Jamie's down-to-earth character and how strong she is despite her tragedy. <br />Again Nicholas Sparks's poignant writing shines here - A Walk to Remember drips with nostalgia with a small town background and Lancer's revelation. It is tinged with a melancholy that is cloyingly tender and the final script presents a love that is ironically eternal yet so transient. It may not have the passionate intensity of Message in a Bottle and The Notebook but simplicity can sometimes be a charmer as in the case of A Walk to Remember.	2001-11-03

Gabriel's woman is the continuation of THE LOVER and it is her most unflinchingly honest and gritty work up-to-date. A male prostitute trained in servicing men and women - Gabriel has opened up the decadent House of Gabriel with a secret agenda. He is desperate to unravel the truth behind his rape by two men - one of which is Michel's uncle. Victoria is the woman sent by his nemesis - and she is daring enough to auction herself off at the House with her viriginity as a price. Her intriguing appearance makes Gabriel wary - as his enemy is hunting him down....<br />Gariel's woman is by no means gentle. You find issues like homosexuality and self-pleasuring normally eschewed in romance. Schone's style is resplendent and blatantly affecting. The characters are flawed beautifully with savage tenderness - Victoria is forced into selling her body to ward off her employer's harrassment. Gabriel thinks his love for Michel makes him degraded. However, Schone's methodology in hiding the suspense can be quite vexing - she uses THE SECOND MAN to mask the identity and the mystery makes no sense until at the second half of the book. Patience nonetheless will be duly rewarded. Gabriel's woman is remarkable for the poignancy between the protagonists - it is sensual as it is sensuous. Schone's prose in their union can be clinical and yet miraculously erotic. it assaults your senses. The love between Victoria and Gabriel is sometimes twisted with such pain that it is excruciatingly agonizing. You will feel for them - and the revelation of love with Victoria's melancholic story at the end of the book makes you weep with joy. It is that viscerally unsettling with its beauty.	2001-10-27

Frankly I am not a devout reader to Ms. Lauren's Cynster series but gathering from the laudable accolades - I decided to give All about Passion a try. Gyles Rawling, earl of Chillingworth has planned to marry a decorated wife of status without love - and opportunity arises when Francesca, his distant relative possesses the dowry of the lands of his desired estate. He meets a gypsy at her estate and is struck by passionate love - little did he know the gypsy would his future bride Francesca.<br />Francesca is determined to peel off Gyle's control - for she knows inside Gyles is capable of passion and love. However, he is afraid to let his heart go - for in his past his trust was unreciprocated. When someone sabotages and threatens Francesca's life, Gyles feels his protectiveness translates to a burning love...<br />Stephanie Laurens has done an incredible job with Francesca and Gyles - All about passion is wildly passionate as it promises - with incendiary romps and smoldering desires. Yet, one wish it isn't all about passion. The mystery element with the whodunit and red herring comes poorly executed as a poor excuse to explore Gyle's chivalry. It is lucidly predictible and it's amazing how the tale of their passion can sustain 400 over pages.<BR>It is at its rudiment - a story of how love conquers all. Ms. Laurens has bestowed a great love story but for those looking beyond passion - it turns out a tad disppointed.	2001-10-21

Lady Helena Laverick seeks the notorious Daniel Brennman to aid her in finding her youngest sister Juliet who has eloped with a shadowy Captain Morgan Pryce. Little did she expect that her curiosity of men will be piqued at the sight of Daniel's physique and his bawdy demeanor -throwing all the strictures on Ms. N's guide for Lady Etiquettes to the wind. <br />Daniel finds himself protective of the crippled Helena and a sizzling match with her acid tongue. She cannot compromise with the fact that she is beautiful despite her flaws - and when love comes knocking, Daniel is even more sceptical with his sordid past as a smuggler. Even more so - when the story reveals his uncle to be the nefarious smuggler Crunch.<br />Sabrina Jefferies rescues the bounded plot with quick banters and sizzling passion. Helena and Daniel with their chemistry fill the void with magical love and wrenching tenderness. Despite her incapacities, Helena is portrayed with a resilience that shines with resonance when she rescues Daniel from the bandits with her cane. Her unflinching honesty in her flaws makes her endearing. A NOTORIOUS LOVE is joyously and rambunctiously hilarious with the oddball couple lighting the fireworks. The passion inside should make Ms. Jefferies an author of positive notoriety to historical romance readers.	2001-10-21

She handles tactfully the taciturn Tyler when his daughter Faith cries over her woes on adolescence - but never did she expected her deluge of emotions over the tenacious Tyler to win her heart. However issues are at hand - what's with her subdued confidence over herself and Ellen - her manipulative sister - Hailey believes it's a doomed romance together....<br />In this novel, Sandra Brown downplays the drama to give romance at its purest. No high fledged adventures or over the top proposals - SEDUCTION BY DESIGN is romance at its simplest and hence the predictability. Ms. Brown captures the impulse and the courting, the heartaches with her descriptions sublimely. Hailey has to learn to be more trustful of the tenuous relationship; what's more with Faith as a consideration. Seduction by Design may not be as flamboyant as her other novels, but the simplicity is astoundingly appreciated in an entertaining read of love found in serendipity.	2001-10-19

Little did Sheridan know that he is the notorious rake - Nicholas, and he is to house Sheridan as a guest. Along with Uncle Finny &amp; Aunt Aggie, their heated squabbles and harsh personalities are softened by love in their hearts... only if Nicholas can learn how to trust.<br />In this second book, Ms. George does not disappoint. The Irish colloquialism may be difficult to grasp - but with exaggerated descriptions like Nick &quot;charming the barks off trees&quot; -  the book bounces with an uplifting and scintillating mood. It is hilarious as it is emotional when Sheridan hides her pregnancy because her love is unreciprocated. Misunderstanding sparks a festered relationship. However, the magical ending never fails to life a smile when the rogue decides to settle down for love. Handsome Devil is devilishly charming even though it lacks Devil May Care's more textured plot. Ms. George's writing is indeed infectiously debonair.	2001-10-10

Mayhem enshrouds as Astride's death could be murder - and before Charlotte can finds out, she finds her life threatened...<br />Ms. Stuart, whose credits include the erotically-charged thriller Moonrise and Shadows at Sunset, shows her forte in judiciously juggling with suspense and romance. Her romance characters are hard-edged yet vulnerable; Charlotte is a fallen angel who is hopelessly tormented by love and kinship with her mother while Conner loses his beloved to the Kosovo War. Their chemistry is explosive as it is cryptic.<br />It's a pity the suspense and mystery element fuses. Ms. Stuart gives a sepulchral mood of the villa - but in her manipulation of the characters, she has betrayed who the murderer is - and the sabotage is too meek to stir much fear. THE WIDOW thus falls short in creating the high-voltage suspense in the thriller. But as a quick read for exciting romance, THE WIDOW can certainly make the mark.	2001-09-26

It boils to an intensity that is unrivalled in many of the erotic romance novels, and the ending is unpredictible. Yet even so - the ending may prove too abrupt for its own good, which will take readers a second read to absorb Druid magic and sorcery. Schone's novel even takes on incest and abuse which is shrewdly eschewed in romance boundaries to forward her courage and bold narration. It is indeed groundbreaking. <br />AWAKEN, MY LOVE is definitely eye-opening for Schone's relentless style of passion and as a maiden piece of work - it sizzles and beckons an awakening of your most secret desires lushly.	2001-09-23

Christmas Bonus by Lori Foster wastes no time in subtleties to unite Maggie and Eric, who are co-workers and in secret passion for one another. The romp is outrageously prurient yet tender when they confess their love for each other especially when Maggie is discovered to be an erotica writer. Eileen Wilks crafts the story of Emily fleeing from her Aunt who had plans to marry her off to an undesirable match and her predicaments compels her to surrender herself to the dissolute rake, James Drake - Baron Redding. The humour twisted in the story especially when the overly amorous Lady Debenheim offers herself to James makes the sexually charged story scintillating. Kinley MacGregor fuels the sensuality with outlaw Michael O'Conell returning to his wife, Catherine but his declaration of love is obliterated by the cruel fate of his criminal brother engaging him for a crime spree. Love however surmounts the barrier to grant him a requisition of his lovely wife and daughter. The last story by Dee Holmes finishes with Johnny and Emily facing up to the truth that their love may not be extinguished after all - the bitterness learns to give way to their love. All I want for X'mas is an anthology pumped with unabashed sexuality - if you like the story zinged with flames and passion. A crackling Christmas will be gauranteed along with the gratifying satisfaction from the lovely stories in the anthology.	2001-09-19

The mystery develops and links with Hope Institute - a secluded medical treatment centre for the rich and privy; Victoria's investigation is obstructed by attempts to kill her - soon Zachary Hamiliton comes into the picture. A former lover and FBI agent, he is here to assist Victoria and as the mayhem enshrouds, their passion prevails to battle the evil...<br />RUN FOR YOUR LIFE as a psychological thriller is taut but marred by the superfluousness in details and excessive dialogue. It detours and backflashes the details already given but this flaw is fortunately covered up by the good pacing of the story - there is development when Victoria realizes her father is somewhat linked to the whole story. In terms of romance, Zach makes a strong presence with his intelligence and protective instincts, but Victoria is too resilient and independent - and the &quot;damsel in distress&quot; mode isn't effective in enhancing the romance. However, on the whole, RUN FOR YOUR LIFE could be more succinct and brief to engage the reader. <br />Ms. Kane shows a penchance for contemporary romance - and this story, no doubt is credible for a first dive into the new foray.	2001-09-19

Their seduction blossoms into love and passion but their relationship is overwrought by Sam's despicable ex-mistress Farida, the objection of their parents and his debauched reputation. Alex finds herself ensnared into a web of sex - and knows that love is impossibly distant considering Sam's libertine ways, but soon she finds that Sam's interior is not devoid of tenderness. His ex-wife makes a cuckold out of him - and he swears marriage as an anatema, but will their love be strong enough to surmount the barriers?<br />SEDUCTION IN MIND coming from erotic romance writer Susan Johnson cannot stir much impact. Indubitably, Alex with her independent and resilient persona makes an interesting couple with the mischievous and bold Sam. Their dialogue is kinky and twisted with sexual innuendo; their passion stirring and deliciously scandalous. However, they alone cannot sustain a plot that is nondescript and banal; readers wonder whether the drama tangible in Ms. Johnson's previous books is mysteriously absent. The characters and villains are made too sketchy to ever impress and the strength of the book is bolstered only by the central characters in trifling matters on sex and marriage.    <br />Susan Johnson's prose is getting succinct and stories cut straight to the point without any preliminaries. There is no subtleties or grand historical details; SEDUCTION IN MIND is exactly evident of that - it languishes into a cornucopia of sexual scenes without any foreplay or climax to stimulate readers' interest.	2001-09-17

Her resolve is present but her mind is weak, unguarded against the primal attraction that still materializes between the two of them - and with Rhy's despicable model girlfriend to fester the wounds, it would prove insurmountible for their relationships to restore again....<br />Linda Howard's An Independent Wife is by far the most distressing romance I have ever encountered. Rhydon Baines as the main character is despotic and a male chaunvinist; Sallie is branded submissive and feels violated by his violent manner, yet refuses to counter his sexual harrassment. His jealousy extends to even restricting her in her job and her social circle - and that's supposed to be in the name of love? Sallie's independent image is ruined by her weak submission to the flesh - and the descriptions of her fear makes me feel irritated over Rhy. He doesn't even deserve Sallie in the end.<br />An independent wife coming from the pen of Linda Howard is implausibly astounding - it is violent as it is utterly unromantic and disturbing. This story should be one relating to spousal abuse - not laborious love.	2001-09-14

Sophia Giambellis, her grandaughter who is an astute executive is forced to work with Tyler MacMillian - a vineyard cultivator in every sense - and sparks fly. However, the merger is threatened by a series of plotted murders, mayhem and a force swallowing up the family. A revolutionizing change introduces David Cutter in charge of the company, booting out Donata Giambellis and jealousy sprouted. Sophia's dad, Tony is mysteriously murdered. Pilar, Sophia's mum is facing a new lovelife with David - soon the family is undergoing a dramatic change too.<br />NORA ROBERTS is adept at crafting an engaging tale of rivalry and passion in the vineyard - THE VILLA shows her to be a leading lady in powerful and absorbing narration. Sophia proves a compelling character with resilience; Ty proves a softer hero who has to endure with her fierce independence. THE VILLA is interesting - but not vintage enough to be a classic; the middle of the book sags with throwing red herrings on murders instead of focusing on the vineyard. The storms they weather in the business field seems too contrived and easy to cross. It reduces realism.<br />Nora Roberts exudes confidence in her contemporaries and THE VILLA is no exception. It may not be her best to date, but if you crave on deceptions and lies as well as passion, THE VILLA will fit the bill.	2001-09-09

Little did they expect that destiny has planned for Cassandra and Antonio to trace their family roots in Spain to discover that a grisly misdeed and vile betrayal by Antonio's ancestor Rob de Barca inflicted on Isabel de Warenne would make her curses befall on the later generations. The hatred eventually brews and spreads to Cass and her sister over Antonio - and horror soon begins...<br />HOUSE OF DREAM coming from a seasoned historical romance writer like Brenda Joyce is unexpected. To her legion of fans who craved romance, this novella will be earning their sore disappointment. There is little passion and to the contrary horror reigns. Ms. Joyce nicely interweaves the historical period with contemporary with a dash of mystery, vendetta and violence. The suspense is tingling and chilling - the tenuous relationship of the sisters and the death of Isabel and return of her ghost makes the plot uptight with gripping horror - right up to the point of overexagerration and disbelief. <BR> <BR>HOUSE OF DREAMS stays ambivalent - it is a major crossover by Ms. Joyce - and this effort compared to The Third Heiress falters. The ending seems predictible and banal, seemingly slower than the accelerated pace in the beginning. Nevertheless, for fine chills and suspense - HOUSE OF DREAMS is one fine  stockful of nightmares.	2001-09-07

She escapes and seeks refuge in a secret shelter operated by Isabel Tyger, a heiress who with her will decides to keep abused women safe by changing their identity. Helen is touched - and she assumes the identity of Nancy Baker to start a new life. Everything turns out fine as Sam Tolliver enters her life and her Internet business is taking flight - but the embittered Daniel is tenacious - for his job is lost and he wants to get his hands on the fortune that Helen has inherited after Isabel's death....<br />WHAT YOU WISH FOR approaches spousal abuse with sensitivity - from the gritty fate of Helen, but fails to engage with insight. The nightmarish encounter and the fears are related with intensity but the interest flags - after Ms. Michaels shifts focus on Isabel. The story is predictible and it's only till the ending showdown things progresses - there is little excitement to sustain interest. The romance is light and fluffy but not enough to spice up the situation. <br />It is an average effort from Ms. Michaels - the middle part of the story is monotonous and drags without any climax - but for those who experiences spousal abuse, it is likely to reflect your situation - while other readers may feel distant. Sometimes stories need a dose of reality as well as some drama to enliven the atmosphere - and probably more of that is what readers wish for.	2001-09-01

When Rome is tired of wallowing in his grief, he is ready to embrace romance and attraction again - in the form of Sarah. Rome can never imagine that Sarah's nonchalant facade conceals a vulnerable frame and even more surprisingly a passionate soul to gratify his strong primal urges. They strike a marriage of convenience, with a promise that no child can be conceived out of the union, for with the depth of Rome's grief, he could not cope with the pain. However, destiny has it that Sarah bears him a child and it is up to Rome and Sarah to create a miracle together - to apprehend his regrets and forget his self-deprecating pain.... SARAH'S CHILD is one of the early works crafted by Ms. Howard reissued again - yet it is no less riveting and compelling in churning out powerful emotions. Her deft characterization and emotional writing is as sensitive as a gossamer's thread especially in handling Rome's grief. Sarah Harper, where many have the impression of her as submissive, is deemed to me as resilient for her courage in transforming Rome with healing powers of love. True - the resentment for Rome as the hero is especially potent when he neglects Sarah during her gestation period, yet we can never underestimate the corrosive powers of grief and guilt towards his children. As such, the moment when he realized his folly - it is with such passion we forget his mistakes and relish in the triumph of love. As a Harlequin romance, SARAH'S CHILD pushes the envelope to scrape raw emotions - it is definitive of what romance should be - poignant yet romantic. SARAH'S CHILD is laudable for Ms. Howard's sincerity in her writing and it shows - from the surrogate grief channeled to Rome in the story as in her personalized experience of losing her grandmother. The unexpected maturity and nuanced writing - is definitely no child's play.	2001-08-27

Gabrielle Breedlove owns Anomaly, a curio-shop who sells antique et al. When her partner, Kevin Carter is under suspicion of stealing the priceless Monet from a prominent public figure, Mr. Hilliard - she finds herself being confined by the zealous eyes of undercover crime property detective, Joe Shanahan. From then on, romance blossoms - with them battling their weird persona, one who believes in karma and psyhic against another who is of pure logic; a pacifist who is a vegeterian and one who is carnivorous and irresistibly sinful...<br />The story and plot is predictible and hardly a crime/suspense element - it is thus extremely important that the book is kept buoyant by sassy, no-holds barred humour and bubbly characters like gabe's mother and Joe's family and amusing parrot, Sam - who with his incessant repetitive antics makes a great sideshow. Ms. Gibson crafts the novel with wicked sensual tension and chemistry, with the two clueless lovers in quest of love in their hearts, convincing themselves that is not the mere primal intentions that kept them together.<br />IT MUST BE LOVE does not hold any surprises, but the way the couple quibble is uproariously funny - the energy is infectious and definitely romantic, making you believe that it must be love for her scintillating narration behind the magic.	2001-08-23

Ms. Foster's writing at creating sexual tensions is impeccable - she weaves a tale of Bram seducing his best friend Lucy who is widowed after her philandering huband is killed in a car crash. The story is simple yet deliciously scandalous when the graphic sex scenes makes you breathless. The other story that matches the sizzle is Victoria Marquez's Treading Dangerous Water - which intoxicates with a multiracial romance where James Conner is keen on seducing Sofia, whom he thought is the intended for his Dad. To prevent him from being bewitched and plundered of his wealth,  he romanced Sofia only to find the innocent Latina capturiing his heart. &quot;Compromised&quot; by Gayle Callen feels out of place juxtaposed with the contemporary and the heroine Elizabeth is forced into marriage with a baron John when caught in a most scandalized position. There is sizzle but it is essentially hearttugging and a revelation on how love changes everything even the most stubborn of minds. Lastly the story from Laura Bradley tells of Shay McIntyre as an undercover assigned on a mission to uncover the deaths of two prized bullfighters, and she falls in love with Luke Wilder - who is the prime suspect.<br />Hot and Bothered lives up to its name - an anthology that is smoldering hot enough to tempt you to grab it with the naughty cover. It provides a good night read to keep you up with kinky dreams of Prince Charming. Recommeded anthology.	2001-08-19

As an established orchid nursery and corporation, Josh struggles to fend and fortify the legacy from treacherous betrayal, sexual liaisons.... going through life and knowing together with April - what is love and friendship with Joanna's departure.<br />TIME TO SAY GOODBYE offers a good story premise and a four-hankie tearjerker that strives to touch readers with its melancholy but fail abysmally. The tragedy is trite with little emotional force to render it unsettling, and the plot belongs to a category found in a perfect beachbook which is embarrassingly sentimental. The prose on love and friendship offers no insight, and Josh seems to take it in his stride about his wife's death. April seems like a substitute to take her place, without any ounce of character. Lusty sex scenes to titillate and a predictible mystery plot make this book overwrought with too many banal stereotypes.<br />Judith Gould is an author who can offer more - take Rhapsody and Too Damn Rich for example - and TIME TO SAY GOODBYE seems to bid farewell to her usual talents in creating interesting woman's fiction.	2001-08-18

She is inexorably drawn to Thomas despite his flaws and feels deeply attached to a man who made her feelings unfathomably confused. Thomas finds solace and love in a woman who is exquisite and bold - and they are soon consumed by love.<br />WINTER GARDEN under the pen of Adele Ashworth is hypnotically galvanizing - not for its action nor plot on spying missions but in its character study. Thomas and Madeleine are flawed creatures made beautiful each by their own spirits. Their vulnerability is excruciatingly heartfelt and poignant and their declaration of love sincere. Thomas is ashamed of his own past and Madeleine traumatized by her childhood - they each learn that love can heal two lonely souls. Gentle as it is, Winter Garden is strong for tantalizing love passages that soar with boldness. It is erotic and sensuous. Ms. Ashworth knows how to heighten the mood with a dash of innuendo and sizzling tension. .... WINTER GARDEN is surprisingly riveting in its portrayal of tragedies and human emotions and rarely in a romance novel does readers feel for the characters. It is nuanced enough to confirm Ms. Ashworth as a seasoned writer.	2001-08-16

Stumbling upon a murder, she becomes the prime target of local mayor Temple Nolan, who went on a foiled plan to silence Mitchell after his mistake in drugging a girl to death, is afraid that his syndicate will be exposed. His reputation will be shattered. But as always, there is a protector - and it manifests in the form of Chief Jack Russo, who with his protective instincts, makes Daisy feel secured. Love comes crashing on both of them in the midst of the arguments and sexy seductions.<br />OPEN SEASON as Linda Howard's eagerly-anticpated vehicle this year pales in comparison to her previous efforts (Mr. Perfect and ALL THE QUEEN'S MEN). No doubt she is one author who fuses sensuality and laughter in her antics on sexuality and the couple Jack and Daisy is one hot sizzling match. She brings in her contemporary novels with relevance to the society's problems like date rapes but without much insight. Daisy's transformation is indeed a parody and shrieking delight - the condom incident and scandal is a hoot and Jack is as usual a wry hero with strong sexual urges. <br />OPEN SEASON opens well but ended in a rush hour with a disappointing 300 pages. The suspense builds up and surprises after it enlightens on Todd's identity but enervates when all is revealed - with the rest all predictible and fast-forwarded. The story doesn't have a mystery element to bolster as in Mr. Perfect, and it loses its appeal with an anti-climax and simple storyline. All I can say is after her boisterous Mr. Perfect, OPEN SEASON seems like mild Miss Congeniality in comparison.	2001-08-12

Least did she expect destiny opens a door for her when Kyle Maxwell - an adventurer and a wealthy viscount arrives and sweeps her away in a torrent of unfulfilled dreams and passion. She is promised a gateway to Scotland to trace her roots if she brings Kyle to Temple of Hoshan - the final destination of his voyage to see the world. <br />Woven with intricacy, The CHINA BRIDE by Mary Jo Putney is a refreshing read with its scope on an exotic Asian culture as well as an interracial romance. The meticulous details and descriptions of Canton, Chinese traditions and ideals are written with extreme accuracy; no less sublime is her sensitivity towards Troth as the protagonist - who struggles to live her freedom and such is the triumph you will feel when she reaches Scotland to find her true destiny. There is a stage for grand romance and intrigue - Kyle is captured and almost gullotined after their trip to Hoshan goes haywired. As a Fanqui or a foreigner, he is watched and rigidly supervised by Chenqua and little did he expect that his objections on Opium trading could lead to assasinations on him.... <br />On the emotional and romance side, Kyle and Troth are both tortured souls with wrenching emotions. Kyle believes his capacity for love is dead with the passing of his former lover; Troth faces her tough ordeal as a foreigner in Scotland with tongues wagging and discrimination rampaging - she considers herself restricted under the society's mold again.<br />THE CHINA BRIDE is exquisite for Ms. Putney's skilled observations on historical facts of China and her thoughtfulness incharacterization - and Troth makes an irresistible heroine whose courage and straightforwardness crashes against the stereotypical domestic appeal of Chinese women. It is a riveting read with its Oriental escapade - and is high on adventures and thrills. Poignant and engaging, The CHINA BRIDE shines as a luminous pearl in the genre of historical romance.	2001-08-09

Their union is however taunted by a raging battle waged by Simon de Monfort whom Rosamund's loyalty is pledged to as her guardian and Prince Edward. As a royal steward to Edward, Rodger has to choose between his friend and mending his marriage vows for he knows Rosamund is a wildfire who will not tolerate his betrayal...<br />THE MARRIAGE PRIZE, tailored with rich historical details and bawdy sensuality, is stamped with Ms. Henley's regaling style. This story is actually a continuation from its Plantagenet predecessors - the Falcon and the flower and the Dragon and the Jewel, where central characters like Simon de Monfort and Eleanor are wovened into the plot and an abrupt death of Simon in the throes of the battle waged when he joins forces with the barons. Rosamund and Rodger is one hot couple who will stop at nothing to make each other submit to love and it is their passion that makes the read lusty and engaging. <br />Ms. Henley's writing is infectious and I find her style resplendent - but her string of recent work from A Woman of Passion, The Marriage Prize and her forthcoming THE BORDER HOSTAGE no longer holds that element of surprise like I experience when I read her previous efforts like Enslaved and Seduced. Perhaps her work now becomes too saturated with medieval times and court intrigue - that readers can expect what they are going to get. THE MARRIAGE PRIZE is on safe ground, but a change of style could actually do her talents good.	2001-08-09

She is, however manacled by the confines of the society to continue the liaison - but when Jack threatens to publish her first novel The Unfinished Lady which may raise a scandal, she agrees to meet him and convince herself to publish the maiden effort. She finds dimension and nuances in Jack but his sordid past makes him an inferior match to Amanda - and she knows their affair could only be transient, until she finds herself pregnant... and their insouciance could no longer be feigned.<br />SUDDENLY YOU is definitely a scorching read with amorous foreplays and sexy bedroom romps - and Jack Devlin makes an irresistible hero who with his liberal mind, embraces the power of feminity and is a wonderful paragon of a affectionate husband. Lisa Kleypas may have injected her latest novel with blazing passion, but the emotional quotient flags - her ability to draw readers into heartfelt turmoils in her previous novels seemed incapacitated here. <br />Ms. Kleypas glosses the pages with a touch of humour and is deft at characterization - she portrays the languid mood with lazy sensuality and baroque atmosphere in passionate scenes. However, the dialogue and repartee is trite at times, and could be polished to heighten the romantic feel. SUDDENLY YOU marks her suddern bold effort to titillate readers and tempt their hearts  - and perhaps with more emotions this novel could become more of a credible effort.	2001-08-05

Indeed Alex Cross as the righteous dragonslayer and protagonist continues to rivet your attention; the mystery enshrouding the murders and mastermind of the deadly game and robbery heist keeps you on the edge of suspense. However you cannot but feel a lethargy languishing in this novel - it is overwhelmed with melancholic blues and the whole emotional drama on Christine Jones after his love encountered a traumatic kidnap in POP GOES THE WEASEL.<br />James Patterson infuses depth but abuses the character with too much pain - and the grit cannot dispel the gloom. The suspense builds up to a climax after they named several murderers and then abruptly he gives an unsatisfying ending as if the mastermind could be anyone else in the book. The twists and red herring set in this book is too subtle to ever save the plunge in the plot.<br />ROSES ARE RED leaves readers in bewilderment and seeing red for the time devoted to the book - and the sequel looks unpromising given the scope of the storyline.	2001-07-22

The protagonist in this novel is Temperance O' Neil and she is a staunch defender of woman's rights and independence in New York, 1909, settling unemployed and female destitutes on the streets. But her work becomes interrupted when Angus, her new stepfather threatens to disinherit her unless she goes to MaCairn estate in Scotland to help James McCairn find a new bride.<br />Ms. Deveraux deftly creates two characters who are obstinate and hindered by their pride - James believes that Temperance is sent here as a match for him; only to find she vindicates that she is a housekeeper. Temperance puts her strength to good use - helping the people in McCairn to reestablish their estate and finds herself attached to the simple people here. She used to do good partly because of celebrity but now upon seeing a snob replacing her job in New York, she is tenacious about serving good and changing her attitude. She falls in love with James - but their fragile relationship is festered by pride when James calls for his childhood sweetheart Kenna, with the hidden purpose of finding his grandmother's treasure. <br />Temptation is what you hope for in a romance novel - the bittersweet ending, forgiveness, acceptance and hilarious antics and dialogues that make it a rejuvenating read. It is sweet temptation that will set your heart aflutter and sing with triumph for both tortured souls who eventually find true love.	2001-07-15

She joins forces with Claire - her best friend cum forensic scientist, Cindy, an edgy reporter from the Chronicles and Jill - a tenacious dustrict attorney to hunt down the killer and establish ...

He is in fact at his peak after Jack and Jill with this offering - the mystery enshrouding keeps readers guessing and raveling the pattern behind the serial killing from the bridal shops to the missing rings and the unexpected twist towards the end. <br />Patterson shows an observant eye and exceptional empathy towards Lindsay and is surprisingly naunced at capturing a woman's trials of life.

While most erotic romance involves gothic and sinister elements as in Thea Devine's novel, Ms. Holly pens it straight with a typical moral quandry with Florence Fairleigh seeking a marriage through a solicitor Mowbry, pressed by her poverty. Lord of Greystewe, Edward Burbooke in an attempt to save his brother Freddie from a scandal of being caught with a footman in an uncompromising situation, sought Florence as his sister-in-law only to realize his attraction to her graduates to an abiding love.  <br />Emma Holly as an erotica writer, creates deftly sexual tension that stokes on the forbidden primal urges of Edward. It builds up with Florence getting caught with him in sizzling situations, like Edward acting as a voyeur when she dresses and him coaching her in intensifying sexual acts like bondage. The preliminary seduction is deliciously intriguing and explodes to a climax when Edward learns that love surpasses his lust for Florence. Ms. Holly brings in homosexuality with Freddie falling for Nigel but falls short on insight. Edward learns that giving Freddie the happiness is the acceptance of what he is and not striving to mold him as a paragon of society's elite. <br />I think I expect more from Ms. Holly with her background as an erotica writer - she is undoubtedly a master at crafting rousing sexual prose, but the plot and scenario is definitely obsolete and falls short of imagination and becomes predictable. Beyond Innocence is nonetheless a must read for fanatics of erotic romance; her racy and steamy narration makes even the most innocent reader blush and panting for more.	2001-07-11

They embark on an expedition to the Lost City in search of magic water to prolong Alexandra's youth.<br />Rest assured, sensuality and full-blown passion is her triumph in this novel but with an exquisite tenderness and compunction for the characters as well - it is though difficult to accept the drastic change of demeanour towards the end when her aunt gains redemption, and the lovers treating each other with mutual respect. Ellen as a prim spinster and she matches well and feisty as the leading lady; Steve is equally enigmatic and dark as a hero. As a romance, logic is cast aside - just be seduced by Ms. Ryan's passionate writing.	2001-06-29

His style of narration is personalized and most affecting. No nuances here, but HIDE AND SEEK is extremely gripping and riveting. It tells of a singer Maggie and his 3 dead lovers, and the intense characterization saves the novel from being banal, especially when Will as the devious and debonair paycho takes centrestage. He is a tortured soul and manipulates people including his brother to satisfy his virulent passions. Murders, deception and the first few chapters on Maggie's abused past is hauntingly chilling.<br />James Patterson writes with speed and cuts to the point with precision. He dissects the character's soul with succinct description. For a fast read, he is definitely one of the best writers around. HIDE AND SEEK is definitely at the zenith of suspense - the read will induce a primal fear that you can't hide from.	2001-05-12

Soon she changes her life attitude by kissing goodbye to the mundane fiance of hers, Bill , buying her own house and pursues the match she wants - Nick Zielger.<br />CRAZY FOR YOU leaves you bawling and questioning whether change is indeed that good. We are often dulled by our marriage life and where passion and love extinguishes with time - CRAZY FOR YOU explores what women want and in a refreshing manner. Adultery, the issue of lesbian and love are dabbled in this novel - though not much of an insight.

Her novels - tailored with a dash of intoxicating romance, mystery and quirky humour - is a winning formula. This time, with Elizabeth Matthews, an American heiress who inherits the gift of visions and Austin as the duke of Bradford, the two of them make an irresistible pair. Austin, as the strait-laced bachelor is immediately captivated by the extraordinary Elizabeth, who impresses upon him as one different from the ton. She hates shopping, possess a medical bag, draws - and is the perfect soulmate for him.

His family reputation is at stake and Elizabeth, with her power manages to interest Austin when she envisioned William is still alive. Soon, his secret will be out, and their love suffers an impending challenge....<br />JACQUIE D' ALESSANDRO succeeds to craft a tale laced with humour and powerful, transcendent emotions of love. The joy is infectious especially upon reading their witty repartee, their bonding and cry when the couple is overwrought with misunderstanding. She brings a twist in the tale to enhance the plot and towards the end a melodrama that is shatteringly intense and heart-wringing.Her second effort is definitely another glorious victory - she narrates confidently and her plot here is definitely more textured and matured than the maiden book. WHIRLWIND WEDDING sweeps you into a maelstrom of drama and first-rate romance and is an invitation romance aficionados cannot resist.	2001-04-12

Her style is bold ,prurient yet poignantly so when she narrates the struggle of Princess Christina of Zeiss with a loveless marriage to the Prince Hans in Silesia. She decides to gamble when she could no longer endure her husband's infidelity. It is where the gorgeous Max Falconer, Marquis of Vale sweeps in and introduce her to a passion of a lifetime. <br />Billed as an erotic novel, TEMPTING shows Susan Johnson at her best after BRAZEN - the intimacy, the sensuality edged in the dialogue and foreplay of Max and Christina sizzles and Ms. Johnson narrates with an undertone of injustice to Christina that makes us feel for her emotional imprisonment and the triumph over her decision to escape propriety and chance upon love with Max. Overwrought with difficulties and the concern for her children, the love between Christina and Max is tested and eventually strengthens. <br />TEMPTING, with the lyrical prose and incendiary sex scenes, is a simple tale of choice between desire and obligations.

In fact, this time she puts her spicy narration to her advantage and not just a story overload with lewd scenes to titillate as in the first novel. A Breath of Scandal is sexy but with a heart - the characters molded out by Ms. Mason brings the pages alive. Julian Thornton is the brother of Sinjun and his rigid decorum belies a secret agent identity &quot;Scorpion&quot;. He is haunted by the phantom of his demised fiancee Diana and swears to take vengeance on The Jackal, the mastermind behind a smuggling ring and who caused the death of Diana.<br />On his secret mission, he fell prey to the hunchmen of the Jackal but is saved by a half Gypsy girl, Lara. From there, the attraction is set - Lara sacrifices her pride to pose as Julian's wife and to hide him from his tenacious enemy, he assumes the identity as Lara's husband, Drago. After nights of passion, Julian and Lara forged a tenuous love only to be shattered by Julian's guilt and the mismatching social status. It is only after he returns to London did he find that Lara is actually the daughter of the Earl of Stanhope.Their reunion is short-lived - with the chase of enemy behind both of them, their love would prove even more difficult....<br />Connie Mason sculpts the characters to finesse in this book. I was a bit disappointed with Sinjun's profligate ways last time, but Julian shows a more nuanced, mellow and resilient shade which I much preferred. The only thing was his xenophobia and parochial view on Gypsy group - even to the shallow point of thinking Lara was a loose woman. Lara - as usual is strong, brave and decisive, as with all the women characters in Ms. Mason's book. Ms. Mason does not disappoint. The passionate scenes are fiery and sensual, and complimented by an exciting plot to the finish, A BREATH OF SCANDAL is lushly scandalous to take the breath away from the fanatics.	2001-04-04

BROWN	In Sandra Brown's annual offering to the fervent romantic readers, RILEY IN THE MORNING is too prosaic and mild to create a sensation as she always do. The central characters Brin Cassidy and Jon Riley, the producer and the charming talkhost of the popular morning show respectively, tied their wedding knot - but the bliss is transient, Brin ran away without a word. The plot started off well - and I like the focused writing of Ms. Brown especially when she narrates it in a way that the story actually finishes in an eventful day. However, the characters left me impassioned. Brin and Jon summoned less emotions in me - and with their marriage problems because of professional jealousy and glamour - it trivializes the essence of romance. I don't mind a cynic - but Jon Riley really left me cold - with his blowing temper and stereotyping his assistant as a dim wit just because her name was Whitney. It's all too offending. <br />Ms. Brown's writing saves the cliche plot from going down. The sensuality brimming and sexual intrigue is what Ms. Brown is proficient at - and she did it with her unique style to stir emotions. Altogether RILEY IN THE MORNING is an average read, and believe me - Ms. Brown can really do better than this.	2001-03-04

He is challenged by the wits and heart of the woman and soon recognizes that it is in fact Abby who had plagued his dreams long ago. Ms. Lauren's writing is passionate and sensual - definitely a keeper.<br />Victoria Alexander tugs the heartstring with a tale of two unrequited lovers. Their night of elopement is waylaid by the evil plans of Rachel's father and her lover, Jason, being taken in by the lies of her father left for America alone, leaving the disgraced and disheartened Rachel all alone. It is only after ten long years, when Rachel's husband has passed away, the chance of a lost romance patched again appears. Ms. Alexander's narration is heartstopping and poignant, and it is a testament to the resilience of two hearts that had never stopped loving.<br />The last story by Rachel Gibson is contemporary, a refreshing tale of a school reunion that unites a fun couple. Brina has dumped Thomas during her high school days for someone more prominent - and Thomas is tenacious to get back at her for her betrayal, only to find that his heart still has that soft spot for her. Brina realizes her mistake and now knows that only Thomas is the right man for her.<br />SECRETS OF A PERFECT NIGHT blends beautifully these three tales and they are all sensual and uplifting enough to keep you a perfect night of reading and enjoyment.

I must declare I'm not an avid literature critic - but Hollinghurst's THE SPELL is one book that is savagely hilarious and uproariously witty. It is laudable that Hollinghurst has managed to intertwine and chronicle the love-life of 4 distinctive men as a poignant paragon of the solitude and recklessness of the gay culture. I like especially the gentle and sentimental Alex - and the part of the book where he is introduced to the glitzy bar and drugs by Danny - it's been such an eye-opener. The descriptions used by Hollinghurst is haunting and imaginative - like that of his intelligent use of &quot;the moths and birds&quot; to mock at the characters' folly wickedly. Sardonic humour laced with irony - it's gay literature at its best. Not to mention the eroticism of Hollinghurst's description - it's instant classic. However, the book clearly shines at where loss is concerned - it's acutely realistic and savage especially where Robin lost his lover to AIDS and Alex overcoming his lost love and sense of loss. Justin, being the sarcastic and selfish wisecracker, comes off as a timely comedic relief to the already bitter situation. <br />Hollinghurst may not have the deeper insights on life as on his earlier books in here, but THE SPELL weaves magic in its lyrical prose which captures such rich imagination. The end of the book evokes a tinge of sadness and asperity over their convoluted life. &quot;Some people may never know what it's like to fall in love - just like some musicians who knew nothing about music beyond their gift for making it.&quot; - Such is Hollinghurst's ingenious insight on love which is sadly rare and obliterated from other gay literature, and because of his keen observations, his work is enchanting and excruciatingly real.	2001-01-25

Belinda Hamilton as the heroine is scarred by her poverty and predicament whereby her modesty and reputation was demolished by an unfateful visit to the Fleet. Stoic and resilient, she was launched into the society as a cyprian to survive with her wounded pride. Little did she expect to meet Robert Hawkcliffe who decided to make use of her as bait to unravel a treacherous murder of his lover, Lady Coldfell. However, sparks fly when they succumb themselves to temptations and the deep shadows of their past.<br />Gaelen Foley is confident in weaving sensuality and excitement into the plot and readers will be enthralled to find the romance between Belinda and Robert a splendour which is overwrought with difficulty. THE DUKE succeeds in elevating the emotional intensity where readers feel for Belinda, but nevertheless - the historical element takes a backseat - MS. Foley has yet to really blend together the historical period with her romance. Her penchance for details in the period is lacking and the book eventually holds a surreal realm.<br />The romance element in THE DUKE is bolstered as usual though and Gaelen Foley shows the passion in her writing and story. THE DUKE is Ms. Foley's most reasured work to date and it certainly captivates.	2001-01-13

No doubt that Ms. Johnson continues her trademark of sparkling sensuality and abiding passion, but the monotonous tone and predictible storyline has extricated some of the authority that Ms. Johnson possesses in her unique form of story-telling and her penchance for the colourful history. The dialogue slips into a blase mess and one remains impassioned over the characters. Which is too bad - the wits of the heroine Isabella was clearly undermined and the hero Dermott with the scarred past in India was left much to be explored.<br />Raunchy and entertaining - when it comes to compliment SJ's works, overshadows her potential, because her hallmark Brazen and Braddock series showcases the vibrant tapestries of history and romance intertwined.

His earlier works, If Tomorrow Comes and Rage of Angels showcases the prime of his career as a master of story-telling, and in his latest offering, THE SKY IS FALLING, one cannot help but feel that the riveting suspense is diluted and his narrative unfocused.<br />No doubt that Sheldon manages to churn out a tale of chilling suspense and plutonic warheads with the charismatic Dana Evans as the tenacious reporter peeling the shrouding mystery of the demise of Winthrop family, but one cannot help to feel the suspense is defused by the presence of too many unnecessary characters and the jetsetting to many places confuses the readers without giving much exotic details and distinct traits. The twist and turns are much too predictible and snowballed into a monotonous read in the middle section of the book. The finale - too overblown and incredible - and it would be better if Sheldon has sustained a more persistent dig at the hounding media.<br />The romance and relationship between Jeff and Dana, the emotional quandary between Kemal and Dana was much to be left explored - but Sheldon stopped short.

This book belongs to that of a take-off or a standoff to the readers - and I personally feel this falls below Ms. Brown 's standard but still manages to convince me that this is an enjoyable read. Ms. Brown is shrewd enough to choose Tiel as the typical heroine as an aggressive news reporter on the pursue of a story to catapult her into stardom. Scarred by the death of her husband, she becomes career oriented and never expected that romance blossoms at a standoff. Dr. Bradley Stanwick makes an irresistible hero who charms and enchants.<br />However, STANDOFF collapses into a overstretched tale when Sabra and Ronnie, two lovers on the chase by Russell Dendy, are trapped into difficult circumstances like pregnancy and shootouts. It is all too predictible and it becomes hysterically prolonged and monotonous - but Ms. Brown still held grit with her emotional narrative and focused writing. Ms. Brown's suspense element as a result goes to dilution and fails to excite and trepasses into the romance boundary.<br />The dialogue is disappointingly lame but given the constraints of a standoff, I think even a capable writer like Ms. Brown falls grave to her plot - the romance element was laudable but the others can be,regretfully, struck off.	2000-12-08

Mackenzie's Mountain reflects cuttingly the grand frontier of love and passion against the lush backdrop of Wyoming and who better than Wolf Mackenzie to tame the feisty spitfire Mary Elizabeth Potter whose cool facade hides a woman of passion and emotions. The first installment really held more substance for the fact it translates the beauty of their love to win over the townpeople's parochial opinions against the Indians. It is deeply insightful for a romance novel to talk about discrimination, the rich bond between Joe and Wolf and how hatred could take seed into tragedy.<br />Ms. Howard has no doubt create a touching novel with this one, because not only it is dazzling and passionate but with the firm belief in love to eradicate all barriers. It was truly overwhelming to see Mary upholding her dignity against overridding objections of her relationship with Wolf and this Mackenzie family has become in our romantic kingdom, one built on love and trust. Altogether this book was such an enjoyable treat that made me want to recommend this fabulous read to all those astute readers out there.	2000-12-06

MANHUNTING is stupendously hilarious with Jennifer Crusie's fast quips and great one liners from the characters. It shows how miraculously how our fates could intertwine and blossom into unexpected romances. Ms. Crusie gives romance a bone-tickling tag to it with sweet poignancy and emphathetic sensitivity to the character's development. Kate is the modern independent hard-edged career woman who insists on embarking her plans to a wonderful life, but little did she know her match was to be one of the most incompatible - Jake Templeton, a man embittered by divorce and the manipulative and cold business life he once was engaged to.<br />MANHUNTING churns out humour fast and vigorous with enough slapsticks to entertain during Kate's visit to Cabin Resort - but this only encompasses half of the charm in this book. The characters are wickedly flawed yet true-to-life and makes the reading even more genuine with a sparkle. The insecurity and vulnerability of Kate marks the tombstone of every woman's nightmare and Jake as a sensitive new age guy is deliciously endearing. It's this kind of romance that hauls back rollicking fun with nostalgia and effervescent chemistry. <br />Ms. Crusie has never been better before and this time after the rejuvenating read - it better send woman going hunting not for the men, but this fabulous book to keep you through the festive season.	2000-12-04

Ally is suitably dignified as the heroine, who is outspoken and refreshingly frank and takes bravely the initiative. She is unlike any romance heroine that looks hung up on the closet - but is aptly intelligent and aggressive, grabbing the chance of love when she sees it. The plot revolves around a burglary ring that is suspected to be entrenched in the glitzy night bars owned by Jonah. Allison works as an undercover, but soon discovers that she is often distracted by the handsome Jonah who gets on her nerves.<br />Nora Roberts is proficient in her narration and wastes no time on unnecessary plot details and indulges readers with crackling sexual tension. Despite this, NIGHT SHIELD is not devoid of emotions too, and it is most touching to see Cilla, Ally's mother's acceptance of Jonah into the big family. Jonah, beliving that Ally and him are of distanced background, remains detached but soon are drawn into this irrevocable chemistry. NIGHT SHIELD blends action and hot romance into a delightful read that will definitely last you through the night.	2000-12-04

Anne Stuart's writing manifest genuine suspense and tension between the leads, Coltrane and Jilly Meyer as well as a secondary romance between her sister Rachel and Rico. The family rivalry, the tragic love story as a legacy from the two ghost Ted and Brenna and the mystery enshrouding Coltrane's betrayal strings up a story of substance and it is rare that a writer can keep you engaged right till the end of the book.<br />Coltrane and Jilly are also multi-faceted characters with their over-protectiveness and tortured souls and both linger between the heat of the passion and their feuds. SHADOWS AT SUNSET is laudable for its consistency through out the book and the irresistible characters that jump right out the page. Ms. Stuart wastes no time in dragging the plot with emotional quandary, and instead expresses the rage and turmoil in each character with clipped words that resonate powerfully the feelings and let readers revel in her short prose. With this effort, it is not difficult to see this book has managed beautifully to overshadow many other romance novels in the market now.	2000-12-01

The plot stringed by 3 stories of the Lester family is crepe-thin and monotonous except for the last story of Harry Lester, which featured an intelligent and feisty widow Lucinda in AN UNWILLING CONQUEST, redeemed the faltering plots evident in the other stories. The 2 other stories namely the Reasons of Marriage and A Lady of Expectations, aims for a Jane Austen style romance - but fails disappointingly to captivate without a trace of humour and satire. It is immensely shallow for a story to be dragged - when the problems between the couple was just communication. There is no excitement and this book literally put me to sleep with its verbose language. <br />The trademark sensuality? I think this book is sterile of that - and the forgettable stories have a lack of traits to distinguish themselves. Which was a pity - the third story held more bone and grit, with both Harry and Lucinda playing the seduction game with wits that sparkle. If there is anything that needs reforming, the other two stories should be in my consideration. ROGUE'S REFORM needs a major surgery in terms of its plot and prose.	2000-11-26

FASCINATED is comparably more well-rounded to the first one with all 4 writers churning galvanizing reads. <br />Bertrice Small, for one, with her MASTERING LUCINDA shows the no-holds barred raunch and passion in the dark labyrinths of romance. The Master of the Devil's Disciple was initially hired to tame the arrogant Lucinda, and it was unexpected that Lucinda with her tenacious and enchanting wits manage to turn the tables around, and found herself a well-suited match in her brass. Compared to her previous prose in CAPTIVATED, this scored with more panache and romance element and most importantly discarded the abysmal thought of incest. <br />SUSAN JOHNSON keeps up with her usual stunning repartee and scorching hot heroes and heroines of rakes turned mellow when matched by true passion. Felicity, a desperate widow finds herself hopelessly addicted to the Duke of Grafton, a man who overwhelms her with his protection and tenderness. The fiery scenes in RISKING IT ALL, continues her tradition of raunchy tales and is an enjoyable read.<br />THEA DEVINE's brand of sensual writing is always subjective, and I personally find her italic writing a little too formulaic and the plot rather in shambles. The sex scenes are violent, dark and will mitigate readers with dangerous passion in their mind. It is nevertheless explosive sexuality written in an explicit tone. Jeremy and Regina, the characters in THE PLEASURE GAME are beguiling with their logic and I find it hilarious seeing both of them in this cat-and-mouse game of ensnaring each other. <br />ROBIN SCHONE, remains by far the most accomplished of the lot. Even though there were some critiques of this story about an enunch falling for a widow, this litany of grief and passion enchants not for its powerful eroticity, but rather the fusion of compassion and tenderness for both the flawed Megan and Connery. This in fact is much better than her novel, THE LOVER, whereby the poetic mood swings languourously to sweep readers with its poignancy. The daring paragon of passion is admirably well-done for its heart-rendering emotional drama.  <br />FASCINATED treads a thin line between romance and being casted off as salacious porn which may throw off some readers. For the proponents of these 4 writers, it is a delicious treat of wild sex and fantasy and being rewarded to a genre that titillates and satiates the human sense. It is fascinating - even for the boldness and courage of the writers to strut off these stories with such ease and finesse.	2000-11-25

In terms of sensuality, THE PASSION is overshadowed by her more indulgent style in The Seduction, but in THE PASSION, Ms. Jordan more than redeems herself in her narrative and the poetic journal entry of a tragic love paean left behind by Sabine's mother which makes the read more personal and erotic.<br />Struggling between passion and decorum, Lady Aurora Demming braves the wrath of her abusive father to wed to Nicholas, who is to be gullotined for a naval crime. The wedding was a marriage of convenience and lasted only for a day - but little did she know that Sabine had escaped execution. He returns to stake his claim on Aurora, but Aurora will not allow passion to rule over her when the clamoured independence and security she sought so hard for could be abandoned for reckless passion to Nicholas. <br />As usual, both Aurora and Nicholas are characters which are flawed and fiercely protective of their loved ones. It's a passionate tour de force with moments of poignancy, especially when the dilemma was waged in Aurora's head and how she convinced herself to follow her heart.<br />THE PASSION still manages to scorch but compared to THE SEDUCTION, it lacks the former's sensitivity and avant-garde fiery scenes. Nicole Jordan with her deft characterization, opens up the story with a journal and that is very refreshing. The readers are held captivated by the intense dialogue and tight pacing, and will most certainly relish in Aurora's go for a stake in a heart-wrenching passion with Nicholas.  <br />THE PASSION is still undoubtedly one of the best in spicy  narration. For all its breathtaking passion, one of the journal entry sums up my verdict: There is no escape from the shackles and bonds of THE PASSION.	2000-11-17

MACKENZIE'S MISSION by Linda Howard is a romantic haven boosted by tight characterization and wonderful characters. This installment remains by far my favourite - because the obstinate and fiercely passionate Joe matched by an equally powerful Caroline is one lethal combination. Their squabbles are intensely infectious, their love made even more vulnerable yet rewarding by their trust in each other and the mistakes Joe has committed.<br />Ms. Howard has sculpted with finesse a delicious hero in the air-force and a sabotage is the centre of the plot. Caroline is suspected and Jow wonders whether their magnetic attraction is a treacherous web of deceit... It is with such panache and fun that the two character learn to fortify their trust, to understand each other's past in order to walk the future. It is dazzling and certainly the best out of the whole series.<br />I wish to congratulate the incredibly talented Ms. Howard : Mission accomplished.	2000-11-17

Ms. Howard has rounded up her legacy of the MacKenzie story with Chance and it is always a delight to see our favourite characters Wolf, Mary, Joe and Zane living their happily ever after.<br />With A GAME OF CHANCE, Ms. Howard weaves fantasy with her magical pan again, with passion stamped over the plot - and it bolsters a feisty Sunny Miller who represents the steel women of the 90s. Ms. Howard knows how to make readers feel - since Sunny Miller is a gutsy woman who lives in the shadow of her father as a vitrolic terrorist and Chance believes himself to be a wild orphan never to be controlled by someone. <br />A GAME OF CHANCE is not the best out of MacKenzie series but the nostalgia evoked in loyal followers will push them to love this - it is implausible and certainly bewildering for Chance to risk Sunny into a web of deceit. Ms. Howard's trademark passionate scenes bolsters the emotional intensity as usual- and the SEX is incendiary - so for this, I think I will give it a chance and delve into this dose of delicious escapism. <br />Ms. Howard has fuelled dreams in many romance readers and with this popular Mackenzie series, it touches the heart of many readers that one day love fierce as the characters may come to their doorstep. It is infectious - and I thank Ms. Howard for rekindling this hope, always.	2000-10-29

ABSOLUTE TROUBLE is sizzling and an overdose of escapism to manifest a pleasurable read.<br />Her earliest book steered clear of any action, mystery and suspense which I was fervently hoping for with such a refreshing plot of Julien being sequestered as a witness to a murder and the Mafia breathing down his neck. However, the vivid characterization and quirky dialogue saved the book from degrading into boredom - what's more with the most explosive kinky passionate scene I ever read - it's a rollercoaster of sex drive. Dulcinea and Julien are both flawed characters and that makes their passion dark, beguiling and the attraction primal. Julien has to battle the shadows and guilt of letting Marcel, his brother into the hands of the Dragon. Dulcinea establishes her faith through this passion to dispel the haunting dreams of being tortured by the Dragon in the past.<br />ABSOLUTE TROUBLE is one escapist's dream gone overstretched but the emotional intensity brings reality back on track and then spirals into a happy ending. It is tantalizing and pleasurable read that could have been so much more if suspense could be injected to make the plot tighter. ABSOLUTE TROUBLE - not at all, absolute pleasure would suffice.	2000-10-28

The mystery spirals to webs of deceit including a treacherous plot to make use of Temple as a shield against viral attacks. The story is logical enough but too overblown and incredulous - Mark Challis fabricated lies just to ensnare Temple to save his father and readers are expected to believe that he is a man of integrity. <br />No doubt the characters are flawed but the romance element really sinks when they are not even given a chance to love given the breakneck speed of the plot or the unnecessary twists and turns. In the end, their passion is obliterated by the suspense and the wrenching finish is just to compensate for the lack of romance in this book. <br />THE MORNING AFTER is superb as a gritty suspense but fails terribly to engage romantic readers - it is only after a night of disappointing read, you find the morning after very bleak.	2000-10-08

Her maiden voyage in narrating a tale between Lucas Hall and Tessa Jardine is buoyant and gripping. Ms. Jerott gives readers a pleasant surprise as she launches into great details in navigation, ships and her description in Tailesen is simply vividly detailed. Tessa Jardine and Lucas Hall after a short affair reunites and chemistry flies like that of the past. However shadows obliterate their romance as Tessa comes to terms with the death of her brother Matt caused by the alledged Lucas in a submarine mishap, while Lucas battle with the demons of his guilt. His job as a erstwhile coastguard makes his life even more complexed as he faces the traumas of death in the past. <br />Ms. Jerott's writing is powerfully raw, engaging and majestic as the liner charting new frontiers. The romance is sensuous and heartbreaking, complimented by an aura of vulnerability in the two flawed characters. Meanwhile, the mystery and suspense falters in contrast to ALL NIGHT LONG, where the beguiling chase and threat notes starts only until half of the story is told. However, Ms. Jerott gives readers a blasting finale where Lucas must face his own battle by rescuing the beleagueredpassengers on Taliesen. It excites and pulsates.   <br />A GREAT CATCH is indubitably catchy and a must-read for romance fanatics for the waves of emotions amid troubled waters and the irresistibly sexy heroes and heroines. This voyage anchors her firmly to the grounds and establish her as a fine writer.	2000-09-25

Eclipse Bay is rollicking fun with Jayne Ann Krentz injecting sarcasm and cyncism into the dialogue; the romance element is surprisingly heartwarming with the flawed characters in their search of true love. Jayne Ann Krentz has never been better and excites with her brand of hilarious narrative to draw peals of laughter from you.

Linda Howard creates memorable characters and with Jillian Sherwood and Ben  Lewis - two of the most compelling characters, their chemistry takes  centrestage as they are thrown together in the search of the lengendary  ruby in the Lost City. Ms. Howard shows a penchant for creating  effervescence in the dialogue that enlivens the mood. Jillian is  intelligent and feisty but beneath the stoic exterior lies a woman who is  hurt and lost with the death of her father. <br />In the expedition, guide Ben  Lewis finds himself intrigued and all mixed up by the stimulation of sex  and love for her. Their escapade scorches and Ben has to ultimately learn  to love and commit himself.

Mr. Perfect is  unabashedly entertaining with Jaine Bright as the witty and feisty heroine  who, with her friends in their reverie, stumbles upon a provocative topic -  qualities of a perfect mate. From there, it is refreshing and all buoyant  humour - TJ, Luna and Marci with Jaine chalks up a list that spreads  rampantly like diaspora through the Internet and become embroiled in media  frenzy as Marci slipped her tongue to one of her colleague. The  &quot;perfect storm&quot; in the speculation rages on. <br />Never once a  moment banal, Jaine Bright is suitably energetic and is a believable  character - and her chemistry with Sam Donovan - a neighbour cop is  scintillating and effervescent. They fall in love with incendiary  sensuality and fierce emotions; beautifully contrasted against the  recovered love between TJ and her husband Galan - which is all tender and  heartwarming. Despite all its unbridled fun, there is a core for humanity  and love. Romance readers will be swarming to the picture perfect scenario  of Sam and Jaine.<br />The murder plot may not be perfect murder but it is  credible with all the guessing of who-dun-it when Marci is killed. A psycho  killer Corin is in the lurks with his twisted mind. Grisly. Morbid. I  wouldn't want to spoil the fun for you by revealing his identity. It keeps  the story going and spiced up with passionate love scenes between Jaine and  Sam, you wouldn't want the book to end.

Fia Merrick is in silent angst - being ruthlessly manipulated like a social  puppet in England, the Earl of Carr plans to secure his power using Fia as  a boarding step. She is left devastated when she finds Thomas critical of  her because of her position as a daughter to Carr. <br />The Ravishing One  shines - and Fia catapults the narration to one of strength and emotional  intensity. Her affection towards Kay, her desperate escape into a quick  loveless marriage makes her a passionate character. She is drawn into  treachery when she realizes that Thomas is in fact McClairen who is intent  on vengeance on the Earl of Carr for his betrayal towards his clan. The  ending is heartbreakingly tender with Fia giving herself and Thomas a  chance to be freed of the devious Carr, and learns the healing powers of  love. <br />Ms. Brockway stirs with her dialogue but falls short in saturating  the book with Scotland Highlands charm; the descriptions are not too  detailed enough to bring the rustic charms of Irish to life. This, however  is compensated by her strength in spinning a galvanized tale and climaxes  with a waxing finish - with a joyous reunion of the family with her brother  Ash and Raine. Such committed and buoyant writing only leaves me to say  that I am McClairen's Isle: The Devoted Reader.	2000-08-05

Gwendolyn Wilder like Ms.  Medeiros' heroine is intelligent and suffers the fate of being suppressed  by her siblings like the promiscuous Nessa and Glyniss, and thinks herself  inferior in the looks department. She is charmed by Bernard McCullough, the  heir to succeed as the laird of Ballybliss but keeps her wistful thoughts  at bay. But time abruptly runs out - he is killed in a treachery when his  father harbours a Prince rebel from Cumberland and apparently his WeyCraig  castle was torn asunder from the carnage. He returns to seek revenge on the  village clan who had refused to help him by concocting a Dragon tale, and  when  Gwendolyn is offered as a virgin sacrifice, she finds Dragon  irresistible and a penchant for love. <br />THE BRIDE AND THE BEAST is magical  - Ms. Medeiros creates a transient fairy-tale realm, of castle and dragons.  Their chemistry is no less incendiary from their banter, and of course the  Beast is ultimately touched and revived by Gwendolyn's understanding. Their  union is threatened when the revelation of the true identity of Dragon is  revealed. <br />It gives a heartbreaking touch towards the end and the  secondary romance between Tupper and Kitty is hilariously done.THE BRIDE  AND THE BEAST revives the fairy-tale charm and fuels dreams in us - it is  so much more with her emotional-drenched writing that charges up the plot -  the only thing beastly is the miracle that this book can be so savagely  tender at times.	2000-08-05

But most importantly, the plot has  tight pacing and wages emotional roller-coasters with readers. It speaks  volume of the internal struggle in Rowena to follow her own heart and how  Cole who despises his wolf heritage is ultimately the villain - the wolf in  sheep's clothing. There is visual splendour - the wild west terrain is  vividly portrayed against the blossoming passion. Towards the end, the  poignancy envelops the reader and is sure to evoke tears from many  readers.<br />Ms. Krinard has never been better since TOUCH OF THE WOLF - but  perhaps her villains can get stereotypical easily. Cole sounds virulent  enough but falls flat in the story with his unilateral emotions - hatred.  The side characters like Weylin can be made more memorable. But these flaws  cannot mar the undeniably passionate Once a wolf. It is no wonder romance  readers are staying all night long to wolf down the story in one go.	2000-07-21

This  brings back Reese Blue Sky, an NBA player who has returned to pay respects  to his demised father and Helen Ketterling, who is a retired teacher, now  working undercover in the casino as a proficient card dealer. The two  characters shared a brief but amorous relation in the past and now the  torch is rekindled.<br />Kathleen Eagle embellishes the magnificent story plot  set on the Indian territory with her sincere and rousing narrative. Helen  Ketterling harbours a secret - she fears Reese would snatch away Sidney  from her - the son that Reese had no knowledge of. But when she saw Reese  battling with hypertension, Helen realizes that she has kept Sidney away  from his diginified father. The emotional trauma they initially face to the  eventual acceptance and redemption makes their love more majestic than the  wild frontier. Their fears and vulnerability are too familiar in our daily  lives.<br />WHAT THE HEART KNOWS is even more credible with the vivid  portrayal of a prominent and authentic Indian culture besieged by  development. The resonant human drama between Carter and Reese, a brotherly  love threatened by Carter's disillusioned passion for wealth is poignant.  Sidney's gradual development of an entrenching paternal bond with Reese  brings up succinctly issues like racism and being true to one's heritage.  WHAT THE HEART KNOWS defies categorization - it has been a long while since  any contemporary romance could stir such emotions and realism. <br />WHAT THE  HEART KNOWS is indeed a sweeping romance presented gloriously in the Indian  territory; and with such a keen observation of culture andengaging moral  dilemmas written with such commitment, it is undoubtedly the best that  romance genre could ever offer.	2000-07-15

It could have been more - but  the tide just breaks - the conversation becomes more banal and the love  element flags down at the critical last moment of the book. There should  have been more passion, instead I sense desperation; the new characters in  the last section just bloomed out of nowhere and the credibility of the  mystery was diminishing. <br />No doubt Jude Deveraux is a fine writer but  this book could have ended with a tsunami but instead the energy seemed  drain as we see the tide swishes up the shore quietly with the collapse of  the rambling plot.	2000-07-13

Max tries to mask his attraction for his friend, Brenna but  the secret desires in Brenna propelled her to approach him first. Both are  fiercely independent and headstrong - and that's where both of them refuses  to see their heart....<br />A grand sizzling romance - this isn't. It is at  its best an insightful dissection of human relationships. Brenna is a  resilient woman who dares to love, and proposes to have sex with Max with  consent from the both of them. Katie, Brenna's sister has developed a crush  on Max and that's where the clash between Brenna and Katie brews. Brenna's  moral dilemma and sincere revelations on her relationship is pensive; Max's  reluctance in culturing his musical gift prompts Brenna to sell his music  secretly. Their superficial understanding of each other matures into one of  acceptance and trust built on the powerful element of all - love. <br />There  is a disincentive for readers to continue TEARS OF THE MOON without reading  the first in the trilogy and may have difficulty in piecing out fairy  characters. The end was also a let-down -- it is utterly unromantic for  Brenna to come back apologizing and begging to stay with Max. Max's gift in  music is also just not believable enough.<br />Nora Roberts shows originality  in penning out her thoughts on love and relationship with this one, but the  love element flags down. It is a fleeting read with heart - but that's just  as good as it gets.	2000-06-30

She moves in to his  castle and finds Lord Bannor beguiling and most positively charming like  that of a prince in her dreams. She learns through his many  &quot;children&quot; of his stoic, resilient nature and slowly she finds  herself blossoming in love for Bannor who is really more than what he may  seem....<br />The book is saturated with incendiary chemistry between Bannor  and Willow, and gives an insight on the feelings as a stepmother. Willow  has lost her father without a fight with Blanche, her stepmother and has  remained silent. Courageous she is - in defiance of Lord Bannor and giving  a chance to love again despite her mellowed heart. But I feel her  independence is undeveloped throughout the story with her subservience to  Beatrix and Stefan, the children of her stepmother. Ms. Medeiros knows how  to make readers feel for the passion - and it is with sweetbitter tang that  Bannor decides to abandon his shadow and loves again. Through Willow as an  intermediary, he learns to communicate with his children and opens up his  own heart to an abiding love. <br />With sparkling dialogue and humour,  Charming the Prince is kept afloat with energy despite the typical medieval  romance and happily-ever-after.

LOVING EVANGELINE is great for its romance with Robert as an obstinate man  who cannot bear his life to be entrapped by his fervor desire for Evie much  less admitting to himself that he is in love.<br />The emotions evoked by both  of the characters are strong and passionate backed by an exciting story of  fraud and embezzlement by Mercer in Robert's company. Robert suspects that  Evie may be in league with Mercer and refuses to let his senses go with his  heart for Evie...<br />LOVING EVANGELINE is another winner even though the  suspense element in the book falters in comparison to DREAM MAN and AFTER  THE NIGHT.

Just like what  Robert said, &quot;LOVING EVANGELINE took away his heart and soul.&quot; No  doubt - reading this book took away all my heart and soul with the splendor  of their passion.	2000-06-16

Not that these stories lack poignancy or anything, but Ms Howard's story spears off such emotional  powerhoue that the other stories falter in comparison. Linda Howard is  amazing with her central characters, Anna and Saxon Malone in &quot;The Way  Home&quot; where she explores a woman's heart trapped by Saxon's facade of  impassion. Anna loves Saxon much but finds that he has withdrawn with his  past as an orphan. Anna's pregnancy and marriage crumbles his assuring  identity as a single man, but he knows he loves Anna and is willing to make  a compromise. This story will wring heartfelt compassion for Anna and  triumph when they succumb all the odds for a happy-ever-after.<br />The other  story by Paula Detmer Riggs is equally heart-wrenching with Lisa and Max  embroiled in an unforgettable passion. The other by Ms. Bagwell tells of  Caroline Pardee falling in love with the father of a baby she has found.<br />A BOUQUET OF BABIES is worthwhile for fanatics of Ms. Howard and  heart-rendering stories, but for those who have read &quot;The Way  Home&quot; in her past books, the appeal of this book will be undermined  though.THis is not to say that the other two authors are not good - they  are equally credible.

Prince Rafael is by far the most  decadent rake of his time, but being betrayed by love once, he is at once  vulnerable. He fears he will always be undermined as a ruler by his father  - who thinks he is too immature to take over the helm. <br />As the Masked  Rider, Daniela suffers the impending fate of being gullotined with her  identity exposed, and Rafael saves her despite the castigation of his  friends beside him and learns to grasp his destiny and make his choices. He  sees Daniela as a fragile woman so worthy of his protection and his love,  and a testament to the unbridled trust he has never seen from anyone.  <br />But treachery in the court and his decadent ways threaten to split the  union apart. Their tenuous love makes it so vulnerable to attack by the  preposition of the sinister Orlando, Rafael's former lover. They are put to  a gruelling test; through the obstacles, the richness of their bond is  intensified. Daniela has not once give up on the wastrel Rafael, and fights  courageously beside her husband to reclaim the throne that was nearly lost  to Rafael. Rafael also acknowledged the fact his transformation to a man  was the result of an abiding love for this endearing woman. <br />There is a  keen sense of observation with alluring poetry - Ms. Foley has managed to  structure the exotic, surreal realm of the Ascension and contrasted with  the sprawling poverty side where Daniela was raised. Ms. Foley knits many  tender human elements - friendship between Mateo and Daniela, Daniela's  spirited soul brimming with astute wit and courage, Rafael's redemption at  love, and how Rafael learns about trust and acceptance. The most poignant  and touching of all, the declaration of Lazar's love for his son. <br />Beside  Ms. Foley's sweeping sensuality, in PRINCE CHARMING she has matured and  honed her skills of description and pacing to incredible finesse. The  chemistry between Daniela and Rafe is heart-tugging and their love no less  majestic on the shores of Ascension. From the climax of the foil of  Daniela's robbery plan to the beleaguered treachery in the Courts, Ms.  Foley narrates with zest and vivid descriptions. Her fruits of labour can  finally be recognized after years of balancing her stint as a waitress and  devotion into her writing, and it is in PRINCE CHARMING, the emotional and  focused writing that her commitment shines. <br />Ms. Foley has bestowed upon  readers one engaging read that is never formulaic and is instantly  appealing. She stretches her creativity in constructing different settings  (a female Robin Hood) which are luminous to the banal ones in the flood of  historical romances nowadays; her heroes and heroines are always  true-to-life and flawed. <br />With such enchantment and overwhelming passion,  you can say I am practically charmed - off my feet by PRINCE CHARMING.	2000-06-10

From the start of the book, the mystery and suspense element enshrouded the book with Lord  Stephen Barrett eluding his murderer.The uplifting romance dawns when  Hayley Albright rescues this stranger and offers him a shelter. There is a  buoyant exuberance in Hayley's family with memorable characters such as her  angelic sister, Callie and Pamela. Lord Stephen is unexpectedly attracted  to Hayley, who is one of the most resilient and yet vulnerable heroine I  have ever read, and writes for a gentleman's magazine to support her  family. The attraction is cast; the mystery and deceit thickens as Stephen  is hunted by the killer and keeps his identity as a marquis a secret from  Hayley. <br />Initially I did have reservations about the lack of rich  historical details in the book, but the plot is just engaging and the  chemistry between Hayley and Stephen is wondrous. It is at once tender when  the flawed Stephen admits love and seeks redemption from Hayley; it is a  satirical parody with the irony of having to hold their affections at bay  and scintillating with the sparring of quirky dialogue; it is at once  poignant and heart-ravaging with Stephen abandoning Hayley for her sake.  The side characters such as Justin, Grimsley and Pierre are exceptionally  well-characterized. The side-plot of mystery and who-dun-it injects the  story with overwhelming excitement. <br />She is one of the few writers who  can trigger such emotional roller-coasters with her detailed descriptions  at Hayley's and Stephen's inner thoughts.It is one exquisite love story  that charges undercurrent of hope and faith in readers as Stephen learns to  dispel his cyncism and let an abiding love bind him to the lovely and  intelligent Hayley.<br />RED ROSES MEAN LOVE showcases her versatile and  visceral grip with nuanced emotions, which is extremely unexpected and  delightful for a debut.  If JACQUIE D' ALESSANDRO could enhance her stories  with even richer historical detail, it would be a bonus to her gifts in  writing. Nevertheless, kudos to her for giving us a great romance treat  that promises more than flowery proses. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2000-06-07

The chemistry between Logan and Dani is one fuelled by hot  sensuality, riveted passion and unrequited love. Her stunning romance  novels are nevertheless typical, but it is also through the simplicity that  you find her books true-to-earth.It is at once heart-rendering in a class  of its own with the stumbling blocks of life Dani and Logan had to go  through.<br />Exquisite and compelling, this book is in a class by itself.	2000-06-05

Thea Devine's story creates  blazing sensuality with the hero, Nick of a story about a simple  love-triangle and admitting desire before a wedding. Olivia Rupprecht  dishes a story of a romance writer falling in love with her editor who  firmly believes in her sensual stories to sparkle and incite. Evelyn Roger  falters in the department of sensuality with this one, a forgettable tale  of a woman learning love at first sight.<br />INDULGENCE is a fleeting read  and one that is made up of sensual pleasures and fluffy dreams. The sex and  romanticized elements are as indulgent - and as empty in emotion-stirring.  It engages but is not as poignant since characterization is vague. A pity -  for this book has more than the potential to dish only castles in the air.	2000-06-04

Michelle Jerott is one of the writers with an unique style and humor of her own and manages to sustain the  interest of readers with tantalizing heroes such as Rik Magnusson and  intelligent,feisty characters like Annie Beckett.<br />Set in Wisconsin, the  secondary plot engages you into the world of Officer Lewis Hudson and the  Black Hawk War of 1832. Through a series of letters, it gives you an  insight on Hudson's thoughts on families, war and love, and is surprisingly  refreshing. Annie intends to return the injustice suffered by Lewis with  his name smeared in treason. <br />Rik's Black Hollow Farm serves as her  destination to unveil the mystery behind this, and never did she expected  to be attracted to Rik. There is high-voltage chemistry, kinky fantasies  and scintillating humour and sparring between the two emotional  characters.However,readers may find the chemistry between Annie and Rik too  incredible to make belief.<br />Fortunately, Ms. Jerott is an author who  blends poignancy and sensuality with such smooth ease that ALL NIGHT LONG  is that heart-ravaging as well as memorable. It is a love-story that spoke  redemption when Rik gains a chance to be in love after his painful divorce,  and Annie's dream of anchoring herself to the harbor of love after years of  isolation as an orphan is touching. Rik's daughter, Heather, matures under  Annie's friendship and comes to terms with her embittered stepfather, her  mother and Rik. The attraction is instantaneous between Rik and Annie and  elevates a modern story to one of rich historical details and sparkling  chemistry.<br />Only a few authors have succeeded in exciting me to  contemporary romances.Linda Howard is one - and I am glad to proclaim Ms.  Jerott is another.	2000-06-02

From her early novels such as THE WARRIOR and THE HEARTBREAKER, Ms. Jordan never  fails to convince me that historical romance can be such engaging read with  the right chemistry and poignancy.But in THE SEDUCTION, she tests her  boundaries with rejuvenating and intelligent dialogues and some erotic  imaginative scenes that spices up the story.<br />Lady Vanessa Wyndham is one  amazing character - strong-minded and intelligent, who agrees to redeem his  brother by offering her services as a guardian to Lord Damien's sister  (Olivia), because her brother, Aubrey has inflicted paralysis on Olivia in  a forbidden tryst. Vanessa manages to win the trust and friendship of  Olivia and charms Damien with her unique blend of beauty and wit. Damien,  being a notorious rake, sought only his pleasure in tempting Vanessa, but  never did he realize he would lose his heart as well. <br />The secondary  romance with Aubrey and Olivia is one that miraculously compliments that of  Vanessa and Damien - both seeks redemption and understanding in love. There  is sensuality in the love scenes especially where Damien and Vanessa agreed  on a coaching of love-making. Damien is frightened of his obsession with  her, and he understands he is not worthy of her with his past decadent  ways. <br />It is not just steamy sex that gloss up the pages but the mutual  understanding and heated chemistry between the two characters that is  lacking in many historical romances. Ms. Jordan is a gifted writer who  knits many universal values together -the friendship between Olivia and  Vanessa, the acceptance and forgiveness shown in Damien's love for Vanessa  and his sister. It surpasses the ordinary historical romances with a  passionate style. Altogether, this book is a keeper and is one which  restores faith and love in cynics like me. <br />THE SEDUCTION is dazzling,  passionate and heart-rendering that will enthrall fans of this talented  writer. With a period of absence from the writing scene, she proves she  hasn't lost the magical touch.<br />Welcome back, Nicole Jordan.	2000-05-30

Venus Duras and Jack - the Marquis of Redvers  are attracted hypnotically to each other from the start of the book - and  showers of sparks flew between them with their witty and quirk innuendoes  and dialogues. They are too obstinate and independent to let passion  overrule their mind, but as they entrenched in hot carnal mating, both are  discovering their inexplicable infatutation and desires for each other.  <br />Susan Johnson is one of the few romantic authors of today who dares to  be unbridled in her sensuality. Her writing is refreshing, teasing and  engaging. None of the authors today can rival her in crafting scintillating  dialogues and feisty heroines like Venus. Lengendary Lover is indulgent and  scandalously bold - with such melting chemistry between the two characters.  There is a lush moment of poignancy when Jack realizes he rather trade his  freedom for the love, and behind the treachery of the ton and whimisical  villains such as the Palmers - the exciting pace of the romance is set.  <br />My only complaint is that Johnson's trademark historical details are  quite lacking in this book - but with the story's wit and wicked  sensuality, it more than makes up for it. Detractors may find the sexual  scenes in the book an affront, but for me, it just spice up the chemistry  even more. <br />Susan Johnson never fails to amaze readers with her  richly-taliored historical details and sensual writing. It is what sets her  apart from accomplished erotic writers like Thea Devine and Beatrice Small  - who strays onto dark eroticism. Her style is warm, passionate and  inviting - and that is what makes up Legendary Lover to be the hottest book  up-to-date.	2000-05-20

Demon /  Harry is the eligible bachelor swooned off by her beauty and innocence but  is hesistant about surrendering his love for her. The age gap between them  poses a stumbling block to their romance too in the ostracizing community.  <br />It is often easy for readers to be enticed by the sparkling chemistry  between the two characters, forgetting about the plot in this book.However,  it is an added bonus if the tension of the plot compliments with their  chemistry. A Rogue Proposal fails in the side-plot where I find myself  skipping pages of the mundane findings of the mystery - and the ending is  just so predictable.<br />Stephanie Laurens,however,is a master at crafting  wondrous chemistry between Felicity and Demon, where there is unexpected  poignancy at Demon's sacrifice for Felicity. Despite his resilient and  chivalrous self, there is fleeting gentleness in his heart reserved for  Felicity, which charms the reader. Sensuality - you get bucketloads of it -  this book is just hot.<br />From her earlier work in Rough around the edges to  the Bar Cynster series, there is talent in Laurens waiting to be unearthed.  Proving herself to be top-notch, Laurens' writing is the epitome of romance  - rich, sensual and exhilarating.<br />A Rogue's Proposal may not be her best  work just yet, but I must say it is a commendable piece of work given the  dazzling chemistry. Worth reading.	2000-05-17

Her last offering, The Lady's Tutor was a no-holds barred  passion that shone with poignancy, enticing all your senses in the  forbidden world of passion with richly-flavored historical details and  stoic characters like Elizabeth and Ramiel. <br />The Lover,her third  full-length book,is more complexed, darker and more somber. She ventures  into the gloomy labyrinth of male prositution with the flawed character  Michel/Michael. He is tormented by his past,deprived of a childhood and  suffers from repulsive burns.Anne Aimes is a spinster, who through her  solicitor engages Michael to show her sexual pleasure and slowly develops  her own suppressed desires with him. <br />The Lover, with its convoluted plot  and intricacies may prove hard to stomach for some. For the first half of  the book, even with its surreal realm of hot-brewed lust, you cannot feel  the full blast of the sensuality of the sexual scenes simply the  characterization is vague. Which is a pity. For the first part of the story  brims with stark lust that tempts and excites the reader, you cannot feel  there is love intertwined in the process because you are clueless to inner  thoughts of Michel/Michael. It is only after the enshrouding mystery is  revealed towards the end of the book, then you can understand the  desperation and fervor of their love-making. The last sexual scene involved  reaches the zenith of desire, simply because you see the bliss of two  tortured souls understanding through bondage. It is only in the second half  of the book, you see the characters developing and making sense of their  dialogues.This pales in comparison to The Lady's tutor who weaves  heightened sensuality because of Schone's intelligent dialogues.  <br />However, credit still has to be given to Schone, who succeeds in  crafting a utterly gripping tale and a climax towards the end. It is only  after you understand the bitter fate of Michael,then everything comes full  circle. If you reread the first part of the book again, then will you feel  the urgency of their mating. Schone edges into gritty details of insertion  of diaphragms and male prostitution, and created a strong female character  who confronts with her passion bravely.<br />Schone displays unprecedented  courage in attempting novelties in The Lover, but romance is still a  fundamental sharing of love between two souls and not just confronting with  inner desires. It is what endears the readers to The Lady's tutor and A  Lady's pleasure - and what makes Robin Schone a poignant writer and a tour  de force.<br />The Lover is highly sensual and is definitely worth a read even  though it falters in comparison to her last work.	2000-05-07
