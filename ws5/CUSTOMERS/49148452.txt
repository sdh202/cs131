To be frank, the minute I heard the premise of this book I knew that I would love it.  Author Frank Cottrell Boyce could have filled the pages of \\"Millions\\" with an unbroken stream of consciousness (appropriate for young readers, of course) and I STILL would have thought this book bloody marvelous.  As it happens, \\"Millions\\" is well-written in spite of my unrepentant love.  Sure it has its ups and downs and there is one plot element that doesn't make a lick of sense, but on the whole Boyce has come up with something truly smart and funny here.  As its hero Damian would say, \\"Quality\\".<br /><br />What would you do if you found 229,370 in cash?  If it just came falling out of the sky and into your lap, what would you do?  If you're like Damian, you've a moral dilemma on your hands.  Do you give the money to the poor or do you dig wells in Africa?  If you're Damian's older brother Anthony then you're trying to decide whether or invest in real estate or just buy a house upfront.  This may all sound like idle speculation, but for Damian and Anthony it's a problem they have to face right now!  You see, our story takes place mere days before England is just about to make the change from a pound based system to that of the new Euro.  That means that the money that came flying at Damian in a duffle bag thrown from a train has to be spent as quickly as possible before it becomes worthless.  Damian's goals tend to be goodhearted, partly because he's obsessed with saints and sainthood.  Anthony, however, is more inclined to want to spend the pounds on making more dough.  He's a businessman at heart.  Whatever their intentions, though, it soon becomes clear that having a lot of money is more difficult that either of them could have anticipated.  Especially when the people who threw it from the train in the first place want it back....<br /><br />Boyce's book is one of the rare children's novels that never hit it big in America but that still got made into a movie.  The book has a particularly contemporary feel to it.  The gadgets and games mentioned in it (such as plasma televisions) on first glance may date the novel in several years' time.  However, when you consider that this is basically a period piece anyway (it takes place at a very particular moment in history) then such excesses are more than justified.  Also, Damian constantly mentions a website that you should check out if you get a chance.  I wasn't personally able to figure out the games on that site, but it's still worth a chuckle.  Where else could you send a friend a saint's ear?<br /><br />The magical realism in \\"Millions\\" (Damian is visited frequently by saints of all types) works well within the story.  It rarely jars or falls flat.  The sole exception to this, to my mind, was the last visitation Damian receives.  I don't want to give anything away, but the moment is unnecessary and reminded me a bit more of that awful movie \\"Casper\\" than I would have liked.  Another problem with the book comes in the form of the character of Dorothy.  A potential girlfriend to the boys' father, she switches back and forth between good and bad without any logic.  One moment Damian's having visions of her on a train and the next she's waltzing into the house, clearly not on a train.  It's not only confusing, but downright weird and done without much in the way of explanation.<br /><br />Still, the book's a gem.  It's hard to create a likable character like Damian who is so very very good without turning him into an annoying freak of some kind.  It is exceedingly easy to write a mean or nasty character.  To write a good one can be an excessive challenge.  Damian, however, is perfect the way he is.  You never resent him and you're always on his side.  \\"Millions\\" also shows the evils of money as clearly as possible.

(Boston Globe-Horn Book Awards (Awards))	Books	5	28	29	N	N	The attraction to Traction Man, man	It's funny, but I think we can say that the picture-book-superhero-genre is still in its infancy.  There's, \\"Kapow\\", of course and \\"The Adventures of Sparrowboy\\", but these are stories of ordinary kids being super.  Far more difficult, in a way, is a story about an action figure.  Now there is no lack of stories where toys take on a life of their own when their owners aren't around.  With, \\"Traction Man Is Here\\", however, author Mini Grey turns this conceit on its head.  The hero of this book may be an action figure like Buzz Lightyear (though he's an entirely different type of toy) but any adventures you read about in this book are from the head of the boy moving Traction Man about.  You may not see the kids' hands and Traction Man may appear to move on his own accord, but there is little doubt who the real brains behind the operation is.  It makes, oddly enough, for thrilling reading.<br /><br />A boy writes a note to Santa requesting another Traction Man since his old one was involved in what is simply referred to as, \\"the Terrible Parachute Accident\\".  Santa may not be aware of the boy's request, but his parents are certainly on the ball because Christmas Day brings a brand new bright and shiny Traction Man (complete with Dazzle-Painted Battler Pants).  Thus begin our hero's adventures. Each time he appears, his new outfit is lovingly described (as in the sentence, \\"Traction Man is crawling through the overgrown shrubbery near the Pond, wearing Jungle Pants, Camouflage Vest and Sweaty Bandanna\\").  This is all well and good up until the moment the family goes to knit-crazy Granny's.  Traction Man receives an all-in-one knitted green romper suit and matches bonnet.  It's adorable and completely inappropriate for his line of work.  Fortunately, Traction Man's quick thinking sidekick Scrubbing Brush finds a way to solve the romper problem and save some spoons in need.<br /><br />Right from the start I recognized that Grey was doing something that few authors remember from their childhood.  When I was a kid, any and every inanimate object was fair game for my imaginings.  Likewise in this book, Traction Man battles pillows and sponges and befriends a friendly brush as well.  As an author, Grey has a real feel for what it's like to be a kid playing with a favorite toy.  The book looks like a comic book at all the right points and really does become quite exciting, almost in spite of its low-rent sets.<br /><br />Grey's attention to detail is also stunning.  The night the boy gets the present containing Traction Man on his bed you can see an exciting adult foot who's sock has (oh joy) unraveled at the heel.  I OWN socks just like that!  This probably explains why Granny's so gung ho about knitting more for the family.  Toys that do battle or are saved by Traction Man in the course of the tale are visible on the boy's floor right at the book's start.  I also loved that his older sister is continually carrying around her own Christmas present: a copy of Practical Woodworking.  You hardly ever see her when her nose isn't pressed to the pages.  I like to think that some of the boy's wooden toys came from her hands.  Words spoken by real people always appear as italicized printed texts.  Plus, the interiors and exteriors of homes aren't only authentic but detailed intricately.  It doesn't hurt either that Traction Man's a bit of a hunk.  I don't usually go for those muscly guys, but there's something appealing in this fella's face.  Just a thought.<br /><br />And though this comment is a bit out of place, I'd just like to point out that when Cupcake is being held prisoner by the evil Dr. Sock (yes, it pretty much consists of an actual sock wrapped around a cupcake) he whispers what I consider to be the funniest line in the book: \\"You will be my wife\\".<br /><br />\\"Traction Man Is Here\\" has already won (as of the writing of this review) the 2005 Boston Globe Book Award and it promises to win many more as the months and years go by.  This is apparently Ms. Grey's second picture book so far.  The world would be a poorer place if it were to be the last.  Appropriate for guys and gals alike.years go by.

1683:US	49148452	R2TEMPL5I2U78P	0689850913	309530236	Racecar Alphabet (Ala Notable Children's Books. Younger Readers (Awards))	Books	4	12	12	N	N	Racecar dads rejoice.  An alphabet book just for you.	Brian Floca figured out something for \\"The Racecar Alphabet\\" that a lot of author/illustrators could benefit from remembering.  If you're writing a book, be it alphabet, fairy tale, or plain old run-of-the-mill fiction, and your story is about a non-fiction subject, do adults like me a favor and include some factual information at the beginning for them to bone up on.  That way, when they read this book to their hepped up five-year-olds, they'll avoid the embarrassment of a blank stare that comes when a preschooler asks, \\"Why are the racecars driving through a city and not a racetrack?\\".  It's funny, but the only real problem I've had with this book is that it IS an alphabet book.  If it were not, it would probably have a much wider audience.  Sometimes the choices an author makes are more confining than they can anticipate.  Doesn't make the book bad, though.<br /><br />The book's endpapers consist of eighteen racecars dating between a 1901 Ford 999 to a souped up 2001 Ferrari F1-2001.  On the front endpapers, the cars face towards the reader.  On the back endpapers they face away.  The fact that Floca took the time to make a change that most people won't even notice is a great way of understanding this book.  Floca is, if nothing else, meticulous.  After a quick note on, \\"One Hundred Years of Racecars\\" we reach the title page and an image of a man driving a very clunky, mighty dirty car down a dirt road.  The first double page spread reads, \\"Automobiles - machines on wheels\\".  And we're off!  Each letter begins a sentence that describes the racecar attitude right from the start.  Sometimes these sentences are alliterative jolts of energy like, \\"Flat feared and fought, the driver's foe\\".  Sometimes (as in the case of an injured driver) they're a single word.  \\"Yelp!\\".  By the end of the book we have witnessed a variety of different cars over the years and an increasingly complex sport.<br /><br />My husband just looked over my shoulder as I was writing this review and felt it necessary to point out that it is really difficult to draw cars.  Now imagine drawing a shockingly wide variety of them.  You have to be able to distinguish a car that was clearly popular in 1976 to its hoity-toity 1992 equivalent.  So well done there, Mr. Floca.  My husband also points out that the book completely skips over the period of history where moonshiners started racing their cars in the Southern hills.  No such tribute to these racing pioneers appears in this book.  You may be relieved or outraged as you see fit.<br /><br />In my experience, \\"The Racecar Alphabet\\" is hampered only by the word \\"Alphabet\\" in its title.  Intelligent preschoolers who're into automobiles will pass on this book because they think the alphabet is too babyish for them.  I often want to explain to them that the alphabet aspect of this publication is hardly the focus.  You wouldn't even necessarily know it was there unless someone pointed it out to you!  My pleas fall on deaf ears, though, and I wish that Floca had been a little less original in his formatting.  An odd wish.<br /><br />Brian Floca is, at this point in history, probably best known for the illustrations he's done for Avi's mighty popular (and well-written) \\"Poppy\\" series.  For kids that are just a bit too young for Avi's mouse tales, however, \\"The Racecar Alphabet\\" will serve as an excellent introduction to Floca's work.  Technically adept, informative, and a lot of fun, this is one car title that deserves to be on any racing fan's shelf.

I was halfway through Michael de Guzman's excellent tale before I realized that though I was thoroughly enjoying myself and downing each consecutive chapter like popcorn, I was not retaining much in the process.  This is not to fault Mr. de Guzman.  Creating really well-written contemporary children's literature is an extraordinarily difficult task.  And though I might harp on its transience, \\"Beekman\\" is a fine frolicsome novel.  A book that takes seriously the problems that kids face when they're forced to move from place to place.  This is a story with many problems, but with such likable narration that the reader is not necessarily going to notice these minute flaws.<br /><br />When your name is Beekman O'Day, you've got problems right from the start.  But Beekman could probably live with his off-putting moniker if some of the other things in his life were going okay.  Problem is, they aren't.  His father has this crazy idea that Beekman should only attend private schools.  What ordinarily happens though is that Beekman will just start getting comfortable somewhere until his dad can't afford either the tuition or the place where they're staying and the boy will be whisked off somewhere else.  After more than twelve years of this, Beekman's fed up.  He's just arrived at the Chance School and is living in a lovely little mews.  They finally have their own house in Nutting Court, a cobblestone alley filled with interesting people.  But does Beekman dare get comfortable when he knows how unreliable his dad can be?  Or does he start trusting people once again?<br /><br />For the first two-thirds of the book, de Guzman's on a roll.  You're completely with Beekman all the way.  Whether he's trying to squirm out of a friendship with an annoyingly ingratiating student or running pell-mell down the streets of NYC to get to class on time, you're rooting for the guy.  About the time the school bully starts picking on Beekman full-time, however, the book starts to loose traction.  Then, when you reach the end, you feel that there are multiple narrative strands left ah-blowing in the wind and not enough of a conclusion to justify its cliffhanger last sentence.  It's as if \\"Beekman's Big Deal\\" starts off strong, but can't sustain that energy much farther than 140 pages in.  This is especially frustrating when you consider what a great book it is.  It has wonderful potential.  There are plenty of books out there about kids trying not to trust in people so they won't get hurt.  \\"Pictures of Hollis Woods\\", \\"Ruby Holler\\", and \\"The Great Gilly Hopkins\\" all come to mind, but those are all books about orphans trying not to trust.  \\"Beekman's Big Deal\\" had the advantage of having a very charming and completely untrustworthy father playing with his son's life like it doesn't matter in the long run.  What I would have loved to have seen was somebody showing Mr. O'Day the problems associated with this.  No one even tries, and the ending is less meaningful as a result.  I respect de Guzman's attempts to write a book where (like in real life) not everyone's problems are solved lickety-split in a miraculous finish.  I just wish he'd put more time into explaining why this is.<br /><br />The beating that public schools (or, to be more exact, New York Public Schools) receive in this book is also not to be ignored.  Again, Mr. O'Day is under the impression that to enroll his son in a public school is some form of failure.  It would have been nice if an alternative view had been presented at some point in the story.  Instead, we're supposed to support this fickle man and the book suffers from an age old money-laden stereotype.  Ugh.<br /><br />I'm being so harsh, aren't I?  I tend to be harsh when I'm disappointed in something.  I was disappointed in \\"Beekman's Big Deal\\", because itreally seemed like this was going to be a truly memorable and wonderful jolt of reality (with a heaping helping of humor).  Instead, it starts strong and it ends limping.  I still recommend it though.  Plenty of people are going to disagree with me about the ending, and the first two-thirds of the story are so good that they almost overwhelm my opinion of it.  Whatever the case, I still urge you to find a copy of this book at your local library and to give it a whirl.  You may find it's everything you've ever hoped for.  Or you may simple discover that's its flawed, but still a wonderful ride.  I'm in the latter category.really seemed like this was going to be a truly memorable and wonderful jolt of reality (with a heaping helping of humor).  Instead, it starts strong and it ends limping.

This is kind of rare.  A graphic designer without any children's book credentials to his name, creates an alphabet book in 1996 that (in his own words), \\"had to retain the natural shape of the letter as well as represent the meaning of the word\\", by using good design.  So he produces the book, it wins the incredibly prestigious Caldecott Honor, and Pelletier never makes another children's book again.  Now, creating kids' books is an addictive activity.  You may start out with the best intentions in the world and you may tell yourself, \\"I'll just do this one book to get it out of my system\\".  But after that first book garners some attention you find yourself making another and another and another.  It would have made all the sense in the world for Pelletier to  follow up his award winning book with one about, oh say, numbers.  Yet as of this review (written in that overblown year of 2005) this particular graphic designer hasn't been any more tempted to return to the heady world of kiddie lit.  Instead, he leaves us with this peculiar alphabet book that is perfect for adults who love design but probably downright bizarre to those children who are trying to learn their a, b, c's.<br /><br />In this book, Pelletier takes each letter of the alphabet and displays it with a word starting with that letter.  For example, A is given the word Avalanche.  Looking at the letter, you see a gigantic letter A (the one on the cover) with pieces of it breaking off and falling into an abyss.  For the letter N we see noodles filling a page, all looking like little lowercase N's.  Get the idea?  Good, because it gets a little obscure sometimes.  For example, this being a book of good design, L is of course going to stand for Lines.  Two 90 degree angles made up of thin lines mirror one another.  In pictures such as this, kids are going to have to already know their letters to discover where they're hidden on the pages.  Fortunately, Pelletier gives them a heads up right from the start.  His B, standing for Bounce, looks more like a softened M than a B on its side.  And it definitely takes some squinting and frowns to make the R for Rip look like much more than a gash in a page.<br /><br />Certain picture books are designed with adults in mind.  There should be an entire genre of to-be-read-only-by-adults alphabet books out there.  None of this is to say that the book isn't lovely.  The visual pleasure that comes from the complimentary strands of color in Knot or the skeletal crossing of the fingers in X-ray are lovely.  As a book who's pictures are done entirely on a computer, however, this hardly deserved to win an award for great illustration.  It's pleasing to the eye but from reviews already written about this book, its best for kids ages 10 and up.  And therefore useless as an alphabet book.<br /><br />Admittedly, \\"The Graphic Alphabet\\" is probably directly responsible for some of the more original alphabet books out there.  Things like, \\"The Hidden Alphabet\\" by Laura Vaccaro Seeger, \\"The Turn Around Upside Down Alphabet Book\\" by Lisa Campbell Ernst, or even Stephen T. Johnson's, \\"Alphabet City\\".  Unlike these, however, \\"The Graphic Alphabet\\" is an example of useless design.  This is design as art, not as something utilitarian (like actually learning the alphabet).  I'm sure Mr. Pelletier has many sterling qualities and the book is a lovely thing to look at, no question.  But if you're buying it for a kid, give it to one already enrolled in a class that looks at the influences of Le Corbusier and Mondrian. Better still, pair it with Mark Gonyea's, \\"A Book About Design\\" for kids.  This is a great resource but only if used in the correct way.art.

But ask someone to name an Indian children's book and all you're gonna get is blank stares.  Unless you ask someone Indian, of course.  Then you might learn something.  And what you might learn is just how great Anushka Ravishankar's, \\"Tiger On a Tree\\" is.  With very simple words, a story that's interesting while still remaining pretty darn basic, and some wildly original illustrations, \\"Tiger On a Tree\\" is bound to garner itself some enthusastic preschool fans.  Especially if they've a yen for tigers.<br /><br />In this tale, an almost perpetually amused large cat is on a kind of journey.  It goes down to a shore, crosses a river, scares an animal, and climbs a tall tree.  One of the local fisherman sees the tiger perched and shouts the alarm.  Soon all the men in the village have gathered to discuss the treed feline.  They set up a net around the perimeter of the tree and the tiger (no longer looking amused at its own adventures) is scared out of the branches by a cacophony of loud instruments, and straight into the trap.  Catching a tiger is one thing.  Figuring out what to do with him next is another entirely.  The men come up with some interesting ideas (one of the most interesting being to, \\"Paint him an electric blue\\").  Finally, however, they figure the best thing is to let him go.  The final picture shows the now once again elated kitty bounding on the opposite shore, away from the river's banks.<br /><br />The other day, I had someone ask (I'm a children's librarian) if I could recommend some rhyming picture books that were similar to the kinds of simple words used by Dr. Seuss.  Now, no one beats the Seuss.  He sort of invented the whole idea of simple words making fun books.  And while I was able to find plenty of simple books, few rhymed all the way through.  Should I ever receive this request again, I'm going to pluck \\"Tiger On a Tree\\" from my shelves immediately.  The words in this book never get much longer than \\"rubbish\\" and are perfect for children just beginning to read.  Words are presented in a black easy-to-distinguish font, large on each page (making them ideal for children with sight impediments as well).  The illustrations are an entirely different matter altogether.  Unfortunately, the publication page doesn't say how illustrator Pulak Biswas created the book's images.  In some ways, they resemble woodcuts.  In other ways, they look like broad black brushstrokes.  The only color in the book is an occasional shock of orange.  Whether the orange of the net to catch the tiger, the orange of the tiger's stripes, or the orange of the sun above, Biswas's palette is used sparingly and well.<br /><br />If I had my way, library's bookshelves would be filled with picture books from as many countries as possible.

8385:US	49148452	R2GMSNX9M3ICTT	0027357813	608912926	A Long Way from Verona	Books	5	38	38	N	N	God for Harry, England and St. George!	It's one of those rare books that began as a children's tale and ended up considerably adult 30-some years down the line.  This happens to a great many children's books over time.  \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\", \\"Alice's Adventures In Wonderland\\", and others all began with kids as the intended audience but later ended up in the hands of scholarly adults everywhere.  Such is the fate of the remarkably well-written \\"A Long Way From Verona\\".  A thoughtful book that considers what it is to be a writer, one girl's battle with the crippling depression of adolescence, and some mild magical realism for kicks, this is a mighty intelligent 190 pages.  It's funny, insightful, and one of the few books that I will concede that adults will enjoy far more than children.<br /><br />Jessica Vye cannot tell a lie.  Or rather, she probably could but she would prefer not to.  Growing up in the middle of World War II and attending an all girls local school, Jessica has been having some difficulty with certain members of the educational staff.  She's occasionally abrasive but always amusing to listen to and has a far clearer eye than most of the adults around her.  She is convinced that she can be a writer by an elderly author at the start of the book, and as such she dedicates herself to her own style.  The rest of \\"A Long Way From Verona\\" follows suit, with Jessica doing exactly what she wants in the face of those with more power around her.  By the book's end she has grappled with what it means to be happy in this world in spite of all its misery and has been ultimately redeemed in terms of her own writing.<br /><br />By the time I finished reading this book, I found that I had been continually comparing it to 1972's mighty similar, \\"A Sound of Chariots\\", by Mollie Hunter.  In both cases, English girls growing up during and after major world wars deal with their communist/socialist fathers and defy authority at every turn.  I wish heartily that I had read, \\"Chariots\\", only after reading \\"Verona\\", since Gardam's book was not only the first written but is also more amusing as a whole.  Gardam is not afraid to dive deep into the world of biting satire.  Some of the best passages in this book come when Jessica reluctantly stays a week-end with some rich neighbors on their own insistence.  These people are the kind of pink-cheeked, healthy, all-British family that you'd see on greeting cards or advertisements.  Their relentlessly cheerful and utterly and completely awful.  For a brief amount of time, Jessica falls for the family's son, Christian, a boy who adores her father for his articles about human dignity in the New Statesman.  In my favorite passage, Christian decides that Jessica has never seen any slums and takes her to see one.  The thing is, Christian is coming from a very privileged background.  The area that he repeatedly calls \\"hell\\" is, to Jessica's eyes, not so bad.  As he tries to convince her that she's in the worst place in the world, Jessica just says, \\"Well, I think I expected green slime or something.  Just shacks and green slime.  I mean I haven't seen anywhere worse exactly ... But if they planted a few trees ... If it was all painted white, and it was in Africa or somewhere and they had bright-colored clothes\\".<br /><br />I love this.  And this is the tone of the book in general.  What makes Gardam so remarkable is that \\"A Long Way From Verona\\" has a very modern voice.  Jessica is cynical in a very contemporary way.  Her father has become a curate, though this is the Church of England we're talking here.  Nothing too relentlessly spiritual.  At one point Jessica is sick in bed and she asks her father to remove a particularly sickly picture of, \\"Jesus as a boy with curly yellow hair, holding out his hands above a lot of rabbits\\".  Her father agrees instantly that it has to go and with a flourish shoves it under the bed with a \\"Goodbye\\".  Gardam also zeroes in on that peculiar phenomenon where girls in their early teens fixateon depressing literature.  Jessica reads \\"Jude the Obscure\\" and can't stop thinking of it.  Girls today read, \\"The Lovely Bones\\" and \\"A Child Called It\\" and feel the same way.  It's marvelous.  If I've any objections to this book at all, it might be the name.  Who on earth is going to pick up a book called, \\"A Long Way From Verona\\"?  It has almost nothing to do with the book, aside from Jessica's decision not to read Shakespeare's, \\"Romeo and Juliet\\".  Far better to name it, \\"The Maniac\\" after her prize-winning poem or, heck, \\"Green Bezzums\\".  I vote for the latter.<br /><br />It should come as no surprise that Gardam's book reads better from an adult perspective than a childish one.  Just look at her more recent novels and you can see that she has given up writing for children entirely.  Whether this is because she realizes that her voice is better appreciated by people over the age of 22, or because her publishers and editors are forever steering her away from a younger audience, I do not know.  I do wish that this book might get a re-release under an adult publisher and be rediscovered by humanity as a whole.  Until that happens, however, it's just going to remain one of those amazing little secrets.  A book that pleases everyone who reads it and deserves more attention.

We're all familiar with that overused idea of how no-matter-how-different-we-look-from-one-another-we-can-all-be-friends.  This thought has inspired some of the vilest treacle imaginable and has undoubtedly poisoned the tender little minds of our youth for years.  This isn't to say that the message shouldn't be taught, though.  It just needs to be taught well.  Enter, \\"Guji Guji\\".  The book looks at first like an overworn idea done to death yet again.  Then you actually read it through.  Rather than overworn, the book is raucously original.  It's sweet and funny and even reading its name aloud to small children causes them to squeal with laughter.  Few books can claim half so much.<br /><br />Our story begins with an egg.  An egg in transit.  As mother duck sits reading a book, she does not notice that a particularly large brown egg has rolled down the hill and into her nest.  When the eggs hatch beneath her, she names each baby accordingly.  The last and largest egg hatches and a baby crocodile emerges (hands triumphantly over his head) with a cry of \\"Guji Guji\\".  And that becomes his name.  Lest you think this is some slight adaptation of the \\"Ugly Duckling\\" story, you couldn't be further from the truth.  Not only is Guji Guji accepted into society, but he's a whiz at everything.  \\"Guji Guji always learned more quickly than the others.  He was bigger and stronger too\\".  Such bliss cannot remain entirely uninterrupted, however, and one day the little crocodile is confronted by big, mean, hungry, adult crocodiles.  They attempt to convince Guji Guji to sacrifice his duck family to them since he is truly a bad crocodile at heart.  Such arguments fall flat with the canny youngster, however, and by the tale's end he and his adopted family have defeated the crocodiles and for Guji Guji, \\"every day he became a stronger and happier 'crocoduck'\\".<br /><br />In an afterword placed on the book's back cover, author/illustrator Chih-Yuan Chen mentions that he was inspired to write this story after witnessing a friend of his who was Korean yet adopted into a non-Korean family in America.  Says Chen, \\"The birth of every single child is a miracle, worthy of our respect\\".  If \\"Guji Guji\\" is an ode to such thinking, then it is quite an effective ode indeed.  The story (who's translator is left unknown and only the mysterious Hsin Yi Publications is credited) is a wonderful one.  Just the same, it would have been easy enough to ignore had it not been accompanied by Chen's remarkable illustrations.  These are light-hearted and fun pictures.  Guji Guji, toy duck on a string forever in tow, is so good natured and adorable and you understand the ducks' acceptance of him completely.  There are remarkable little details in this book as well.  Ones that you might miss even on a second or third reading.  These include the black crow that perpetually accompanies the bad crocodiles, or the fact that the ducks are balancing rocks on their heads when they walk out onto the bridge.<br /><br />Obvious pairing with this book might be, \\"The Ugly Duckling\\" (though I've never much cared for the story) or even the delightful \\"Mrs. Chicken and the Hungry Crocodile\\" by Won-Ldy Paye.  Still, \\"Guji Guji\\" trumps all of these in terms of spirit and presentation.

Books	4	1	3	N	N	Winner of the Best-Book-With-the-Worst-Cover Award of 2004	I know that I am just a lowly Amazon.com reviewer and that the things I write make little to no impact on the wider world around me.  Even so, I feel hesitant to read and review a children's book when I learn that it is some perfectly nice author's very first novel.  They must be so proud.  To have put all that effort into a title.  To watch it grow beneath your fingers and become something new and different.  To have it molded and shaped by a variety of editors, friends, and advisors.  To have it published by a big ole publisher like Holiday House.  Then, finally, to watch it ripped into tiny shreds at the hands of some two-bit Amazon.com reviewer who probably wouldn't know the next great kid's book if it came up and bit them on the ... well, you get the idea.  After reading the first half of \\"Crown Me!\\", these were my thoughts.  I found myself worrying.  How was I going to write a review of this book when it so obviously still needed work?  To my utter relief, however, the second half of the story more than made up for the first.  So while this is not the best children's book of 2004, and while the author probably has a ways to go before she can be said to be the next great voice in kiddie lit, there's promise here.  Real promise.<br /><br />Some kids want run for President when they grow up.  Then there's Justin Davies.  He doesn't want to just run for President.  He wants to BE President.  And now, thanks to his history teacher Mr. Bailey, he has a chance to be the next best thing.  King.  When Justin and his rival Andrea Carey are pronounced King and Queen for two weeks, they're both delighted.  Sure Mr. Bailey keeps saying that this'll teach some kind of a lesson to them all, but all Justin can think is that this is the perfect way to get the attention he needs for an eventual run as fifth-grade student council president.  Problem is, being a king isn't all it's cracked up to be.  His friends keep getting mad at him when he won't favor them, he keeps making impossible promises that he can't keep, and now the school bully, Badger, is challenging him to a joust.  It ain't easy being king, but somebody's gotta do it.  Justin just needs to learn how.<br /><br />When I first began reading, I felt I recognized the author's voice in this book.  It sounded oddly familiar.  After a couple more pages, I realized that lay is a dead ringer for Bruce Hale (author of the oh-so popular \\"Chet Gecko\\" series for younger folks).  Take out a couple of Gecko's bad puns (and give them all to \\"Crown Me!\\"'s bully villain) and you've got a mighty similar writer on your hands.  Lay is a bit too prone towards putting bad or corny jokes in the mouths of her characters.  The bully spouts overused phrases like, \\"I'm going to punch you into next week\\" and \\"I'd be just as happy to squash two wimps for the price of one\\".  When you begin the book, things like this are particularly prominent.  Justin, our hero, is not especially likable and his friends are even less so.  It's mighty difficult to believe that he would still want to be friends with them when they repeatedly betray him, get mad at truly tiny slights, and cowardly abandon him at the worst times.  The first few chapters of the book were so depressing, in fact, that I had to make myself keep reading.<br /><br />Then it got better.  Once Lay's really into the story, the writing becomes crisper and the satire sharper.  By the time Justin's campaign for fifth-grade presidency is in full swing, Lay somehow manages to give the book the thrill of an actual election.  Kids reading this book will honestly be on the edges of their seats as they wait to hear the final verdict.  I also loved the character of Willie, Justin's unwanted knight errant and remarkably adept campaign manager.  Any scene in which a kid shows his love of presidential advisors by keeping a picture of Orville Freeman (Kennedy's secretary of agriculture) on his desk has my instant love.  There are still loose ends left dangling by the story's close (we never learn what happens to the ficus that Justin and his dad continually forget to water) but these are small enough that they shouldn't distract from what ends up being a truly satisfying close.<br /><br />The obvious pairing of this book would be with, \\"The Kid Who Ran For President\\" by Dan Gutman.  Also consider giving it out with fellow first-time novel, \\"Donuthead\\", by Sue Stauffacher for another look at a kid dealing with dangers and insecurities.  \\"Crown Me!\\" isn't going to garner too much attention, but it's bound to be adored by those kids who sympathize with Justin and his quest.

When I told the kids in the bookclub I run that we were going to be reading something called \\"Bull Run\\" by a Mr. Paul Fleischman, they were quick to inform me that they were already familiar with him.  \\"He's the guy who wrote, 'Joyful Noise'!\\", cried one delightedly.  I agreed that this was indeed his best-known work but that, \\"Bull Run\\" was probably going to prove to be a little different from a poetry book of insect noises.  This turned out to be a particularly foresighted statement when some concerned parents informed me that they were not comfortable with the violence of this book and would rather that their children not read it.  I was caught a little unawares.  I shouldn't have been.  If you are one of those concerned parents, allow me to tell you that yes, there is violence in \\"Bull Run\\".  Heck, you're not going to have a whole book about a single exceedingly bloody battle without some blood actually making it into the text.  However, the battle violence is brief and the story a compelling one.  If you've a kid just hankering for the glories of combat, this should snap them out of THAT little fantasy right quick.<br /><br />The story follows the narratives of sixteen people.  Some are black.  Some are white.  Some are men fighting against the South and some are women fighting against the North.  Each voice is distinguished from its fellows and tells its own very particular tale.  Sometimes these voices repeat within the book.  Other times, they speak thrice and then vanish without a trace.  People die, others survive, and some just linger on the sidelines.  Most stories, however, end up at the Battle of Bull Run.  Fleischman deftly weaves together historical facts with fictional characters to provide an honestly interesting view of the entirety of the Civil War encapsulated in a single book.<br /><br />There are many similarities between this title and \\"Soldier's Heart\\" by Gary Paulson.  Of the two, however, \\"Bull Run\\" is the more interesting book.  \\"Soldier's Heart\\" just follows a single soldier.  It's more a kind of \\"Red Badge of Courage\\" than a multi-person point-of-view.  This is where Fleischman has the advantage.  At the end of this book, he includes the page numbers of each character.  If readers would like to perform this book as a kind of Readers' Theater, this is how they can do so.  Likewise, if you've a child that needs to deliver a monologue, I can think of no better resource than this book for them.  That's all \\"Bull Run\\" is anyway.  Monologue after monologue after monologue.<br /><br />There's no monotony, though.  Fleischman expertly picks out the most interesting aspects and characters of the war (that are appropriate for child readers to meet) and displays them before our eyes.  I was much attached to the livery cab driver Edmund Upwing, who brings rich residents out to the hills above Washington D.C. to watch the battle like a football game.  Ditto photographer Nathaniel Epp who acts the ultimate profiteer, making money out of death and destruction.  If there are lessons to be learned from this book, they probably boil down to, \\"War is Hell\\", and that's that.  Fleischman is just as willing to show the tawdry side of Northerners as he is Southerners.  A wonderful look at two sides of a oddly viewed controversy.<br /><br />\\"Bull Run\\" is a far cry from bug poetry.  Just the same, it's a well-written take on a difficult time.  I wouldn't mind saying that certain characters in this book should be required reading in schools.  Kids could pick who they wanted to read.  Then they could read the opposite point of view.

When you're a children's librarian that has to perform multiple storytimes every week, you acquire a kind of ear for picture books that read aloud well.  For example, reading aloud \\"Horton Hatches the Egg\\" works well for a single child, but for a large group it's just too darn long.  And unless you have a real rhythm going with \\"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom\\", don't try to perform it just off the top of your head.  Then there are books like Andrea Zimmerman and David Clemesha's delicious, \\"Trashy Town\\".  Combining a jaunty rhythmic story about a trash man on the job with the overly accomplished Dan Yaccarino's illustrations, \\"Trashy Town\\" falls into the category of \\"godsend\\" when it comes to books for big groups o' kiddies.<br /><br />Mr. Gilly has a swell job.  He's the trash man doing the route around his Trashy Town.  With a perpetual look of benign happiness set on his face, Mr. Gilly visits the local school, the park, the pizza parlor, and even the doctor's office.  Each time he collects some trash the text reads, \\"Dump it in, smash it down, drive around the Trashy Town!  Is the trash truck full yet?  NO\\".  Reading this book aloud, kids can yell, \\"NO!\\" when they get to this part.  Eventually, however, Mr. Gilly has finished for the day.  The town is clean, the trash is deposited at the dump, and when Mr. Gilly gets home there's only one more thing to clean up.  \\"Time for a bath, Mr. Gilly!\\".<br /><br />Mr. Yaccarino has a signature style that has yet to be replicated by any illustrator out there.  He's probably best known for being responsible, in part, for the picture book \\"Oswald\\", later turned into a Nick Jr. television show.  In this book he fills the pages with simplified, almost retro images.  These pictures are remarkably simple but convey the story beautifully.  Likewise, the text is catchy.  Kids reading it will learn it by heart pretty darn quick and will be able to do their own renditions of it at home.<br /><br />For a storytime saluting garbage carriers everywhere, consider pairing \\"Trashy Town\\" with the slightly older, \\"I Stink\\" by Kate McMullan for a truly trash-centric program.

I was riding the subway this morning reading Heather Dyer's, \\"The Fish In Room 11\\".  I often read children's books while riding public transportation as it usually makes for some interesting conversations.  Today was no exception.  I was halfway through when a European woman asked to see what I was reading.  I showed her the title and the author and she exclaimed that though she had never heard of this book or knew what it was about (though she probably gathered a lot from the pen and ink illustrations that were on almost every page) she thought this book would be perfect for her dyslexic daughter.  After all, the story looked interesting and the words are quite big (fontwise) and simple on the page.  And that, quite frankly, sums up my opinion of this book to a tee.  It's a very simple story with a very simple plot and not much in the way of surprises or, for that matter, originality.  Still, this is an excellent tale for that precocious reader who feels that they are ready to handle full-blown chapter books, but can't handle stuff by Nancy Farmer, Diana Wynne Jones, or even J.K. Rowling yet.  Dyer may fill a niche, but it's certainly a tiny one.<br /><br />Some people might think it's fun to live in a hotel.  Some people aren't Toby.  Found as an abandoned baby in one of the hotel's many rooms, Toby was raised by the staff of The Grand, and eventually put to work by the hotel's penny pinching Mr. Harris.  Perpetually wearing pajamas and no shoes (why bother giving the kid stuff he doesn't need to wear?, ponders Mr. Harris) Toby has to do the dirty work of the hotel.  That all changes the day he forgets to bring in the laundry that's been drying on the line.  Due to a mischievous wind, Toby's search for the cook's cap leads him to find a delightful mermaid residing with her family in a nearby cave.  When a present from the fishy crew leads the residents of the hotel to go on some intense treasure hunts, Toby realizes that he must move the mermaid family to a safer location.  And what possible place could be more ideal than The Grand itself?  Now Toby and his new friends must figure out how to proceed without attracting the attention of the nasty Mr. Harris and his rat-like son Nigel before the greedy duo find out what's flipping and flopping right under their noses.<br /><br />You get the feeling that with this book, Dyer's just testing the waters (so to speak).  She's trying to figure out what she can add to the world of children's literature.  Carefully, she takes some very basic elements for her tale.  Orphaned hero.  Magical benign creatures.  Lots of money in treasure form.  A villain who has zero redeeming qualities.  Then she kinda mixes them all together into a sort of stew and hopes that kids enjoy it.  Which they might, admitted.  The illustrations, presumably done by Ms. Dyer herself, are reminiscent of old Edward Eager stories (though his mermaids had a little more pep to them).  Likewise, the story is easy and familiar.  Many people will enjoy it without knowing exactly why.<br /><br />The reason why is clear.  It's derivative.  There's nothing in this tale that you couldn't find elsewhere in a more interesting manner.  Consider, \\"The Island of the Aunts\\" by Eve Ibbotson.  There you have a story of some kids caring for a mermaid family, but it's heightened with the verve and pizzazz of Ibbotson's heady writing.  Dyer, on the other hand, is predictable.  Any time Toby says that he has a plan, the story cuts him off and the readers do not hear it (this happens at least twice) allowing the reader to know that his plan is going to succeed.  The villain has no redeeming qualities and is about as three-dimensional as your average Saturday morning cartoon bad guy.  Also, I suspect that roughly 76% of readers, and this includes children, will know or guessToby's mysterious past by page 56.  And what's with the mermaids being able to sing a Cat Stevens song off the top of their heads?  Did that strike anyone else as a little out of place?<br /><br />At this point, large crowds of irate parents inform me that I'm being too harsh on this perfectly nice children's book.  Not a bit of it.  Children's literature is an art.  You either write it well or you cull together some overworked ideas and call it new.  Do you remember those old Choose Your Own Adventure books from the 1980s?  Those books allowed you to choose the direction in which the story you were reading went.  If you wanted the plot to do one thing, you turned to that page.  If you wanted it to do another, to turned to another.  They were hardly great writing.  One of those Choose Your Own Adventure stories revolved around finding a mermaid and over half of the ideas I read there could be found in this book as well.  It's all been done before, my friends.  But if you have a kid that wants something fun, that doesn't require much thought, and that has mermaids (but they've rejected \\"Island of the Aunts\\" for some reason) then by all means thrust, \\"The Fish In Room 11\\" into their hot little hands.  It's not going to blow you away, but for some children it will remain beloved for years and years.as a little out of place? <br />  <br />At this point, large crowds of irate parents inform me that I'm being too harsh on this perfectly nice children's book.

19945:US	49148452	R2SHTJOMG7KFBN	0689851316	824139760	Dicey's Song (The Tillerman Series #2)	Books	5	25	26	N	N	Don't worry if it's not good enough for anyone else to hear. Sing, sing a song.	When the Newbery Award (given each year to a children's book that is deemed the best-written work of the past 365 days) is handed to a sequel, I always get a bit incredulous.  Really?  This book is great in and of itself without having read its predecessor?  In my opinion, sequels should never receive awards.  If you thought that they were so great, award the first book/movie/album in the series, cause otherwise the awardee isn't going to make much sense.  Harumph!  There are exceptions to every rule, though.  \\"Dicey's Song\\" may  be one of the few.  Unlike Lloyd Alexander's, \\"The High King\\" or \\"The Grey King\\" by Susan Cooper (the Newbery has a penchant for \\"King\\"ly sequels), Cynthia Voigt's quiet masterpiece does not necessarily require that the reader know the story that preceded it.  It wouldn't hurt and it would probably make for a much better read, but not reading \\"Homecoming\\" isn't going to lessen your enjoyment of Book Two in the Tillerman family series.<br /><br />After walking with her younger brothers and sister for months and months to their grandmother's house, Dicey Tillerman and her sibs have found a home.  Granted, that home is with crochety possibly-mad Grandma Tillerman, but that's good enough for them.  Grandma has made it perfectly clear that she enjoys their company, regrets some of the mistakes she made with her own children, and is willing to adopt them immediately.  As the eldest, Dicey is pleased but being adopted by a beloved relative isn't enough to ease her day-to-day worries.  Younger brother James is making himself appear like an average kid in school (rather than the genius he truly is) so that he'll have friends.  Little Maybeth has never done well in her classes, and though she's a whiz at music comprehension, she doesn't even understand basic fractions.  And youngest child Sammy hasn't been getting into fights like he used to, but at the same time he's wearing this mask of being a \\"perfect\\" child at school.  Such a strain is definitely gonna take its toll on him.  While Dicey is worrying about these things, it's not as if her own life is perfect either.  She shuns friends and cares mostly about scraping the paint off an old sailboat belonging to her grandmother.  Still, as things come to a head, Dicey's gonna learn what it means to hold onto the people you love, what it means to let go, and when to decide which action to take.<br /><br />Unlike \\"Homecoming\\", which was a kind of epic tale of four small children against the world, there's no real danger or adventure at the heart of \\"Dicey's Song\\".  Instead, it's more of a thoughtful piece.  Dicey is trying to understand what it means to be an adult.  She's been acting like one, more or less, ever since her mother abandoned her children in that mall parking lot a year ago.  While \\"Homecoming\\" encountered villain farmers, nice circus folk, easy-going college kids, and the task of charming an otherwise wooden grandmamma, \\"Dicey's Song\\" is about social relations.  You've just survived and found someplace to live?  Great!  Now get along with your fellow man.  It's just a difficult (sometimes more so) and requires a whole different set of muscles.<br /><br />Voigt's voice in this book rings out loud and clear.  It's simple writing that doesn't lower itself to simple ideas.  This is a story that touches on problems that all kids face, one way or another.  Doing badly in school or doing too well.  Wanting to make friends or not caring whether you have friends or not.  Each Tillerman child has their own separate agenda and each agenda is completely different from that of their siblings.  If you think it's difficult to write a convincing three-dimensional character in a book, just imagine trying to write four.  Plus Grandma.  Can't forget Grandma.<br /><br />So forget everything I said about sequels not deserving major awards.  That idea was trumped mightily by Voigt's remarkable (and remarkably good), \\"Dicey's Song\\" back in 1983.  Again, if you want to read it I urge you to seek out \\"Homecoming\\" first.  If you haven't the time or inclination though, feel free to give it a go on its own.  This is the kind of writing that all children should be introduced to at least once.  It'll bore some, but it'll definitely thrill others.want to read it I urge you to seek out \\"Homecoming\\" first.

And when it comes to picture book biographies, certain names come to mind.  David Adler, of course, though his books are so uncommonly dull that I tend to pity the children I hand them to (being a children's librarian and all).  Peter Sis, though his bios require a great deal of time and patience to parse.  James Rumford to some extent, though \\"Sequoyah\\" is probably his best bio to date.  No, when it comes down to it Don Brown is the picture book biographer that nine of ten kids prefer every time.  I don't have any actual statistics to back that statement up, I just say what I see.  And what I see is an author who is able to take unknown heroes (Mary Kingsley, Alice Ramsey, Ruth Law, etc.) and too well-known heroes (Albert Einstein, Mark Twain, etc.) and give them interesting picture book biographies that kids will both relate to and love.<br /><br />We all know some basic facts about Einstein.  He was a guy with a head of white unruly hair.  When you yell, \\"Hey, Einstein!\\", you are making reference to the fact that he was once a genius.  So how much do you know about this great man as a child?  In this book, Brown introduces us to Albert from day one (March 14, 1879, to be exact).  As a boy, Albert has his good moods and he has his bad moods.  In a good mood he can create a house of cards fourteen stories high and ponder the mysteries of a compass for fun.  In a bad mood he is prone to hitting his little sister, terrifying his tutor, and getting so upset that his nose turns white.  As we watch, Albert is given an amazing amount of freedom.  He wanders the Munich streets alone at the age of four.  He discovers geometry with the help of a friendly medical student.  The book progresses and we learn a little about Albert's personality from offhand comments.  \\"Soldiers on parade excite the boys.  They disturb Albert\\".  At end of this journey, Albert comes up with theory of relativity and, \\"For the world, Einstein comes to mean not fat baby, or angry child, or odd boy, but great thinker\\".  And now our children can understand where all genius has its beginnings.  In the ordinary and familiar.<br /><br />What I enjoyed about the book was that Brown doesn't linger on just the good things in Einstein's life.  No child's a saint, and Albert is no exception.  Brown humanizes this latter-day god, giving him a family, a childhood, and a history that kids today (in spite of their love of computerization and high-tech toys) will understand.  Who amongst us doesn't recognize Albert's reluctance to engage in organized sports as something we, or someone we know, have also felt?  The story is laid out beautifully.  The illustrations are little more haphazard.  Granted, I really liked the picture of Albert engaged in a temper tantrum.  His little fists are clenched and his nose, true to the text, is a slightly whitish color.  By and large these pen and ink pictures colored in with watercolors work well.  There's just the occasional oddity.  When teachers wonder if Albert is dull-witted, Brown illustrates a disturbingly glazed-eyed kid who reinforces their concern.  It's a peculiar picture, but there's no denying that it conveys the text well.<br /><br />I saw Mr. Brown speak not too long ago to a gathering of librarians, and I found that I was not especially impressed with him as a person.  Nonetheless, the man does nice work.  And of the work that he has done, \\"Odd Boy Out\\" is probably one of his best.  It's a beautifully rendered story that kids will prefer far above and beyond similar Einstein biographies.  Not genius, but pretty darn close.bert comes up with theory of relativity and, \\"For the world, Einstein comes to mean not fat baby, or angry child, or odd boy, but great thinker\\".

26340:US	49148452	RTQBBZS9CJDIG	0375824685	931106137	Donuthead	Books	5	6	7	N	N	The Howard Hughes of fifth grade	Is there any sight more thrilling to the human heart than when one witnesses the start of a writer who will someday be regarded as one of the greats?  Sue Stauffacher, as of this review, hasn't that many children's books to her name.  This in no way reflects badly on Sue.  She's at the beginning of her authorial career and is already wowing audiences left and right with her witty/heartfelt tales.  My mother, a bookstore employee in Southwest Michigan (much like the author), turned me onto one of Ms. Stauffacher's first tales by simply quoting the first lines in the book.  \\"My name, if you must know, is Franklin Delano Donuthead.  Try saying that in a room full of fifth graders if you think names will never hurt you\\".  And we're off!<br /><br />Yes, true enough our hero has the unfortunate moniker, Donuthead.  It's a family name.  Apparently when one of his ancestors emigrated to America, the otherwise respectable title Donotscked was changed to Donuthead.  This might be seen as unfortunate, but if Franklin's ancestor was anything like his latest descendent then he probably deserved the change.  You see, Franklin likes his life to be orderly to the point of madness.  His number one goal in life is to not die.  So far, he's done rather well.  He makes sure that his mother buys only organic foods (berating her sharply if jellybeans somehow make an appearance on the grocery list).  He engages in no sports and he regularly calls the chief statistician for the National Safety Department in Washington (a Ms. Gloria Nelots) for advice.  Then, one day, Franklin's matter-of-fact existence runs smack dab into Sarah Kervick.  Sarah's dirty (quote Donuthead, \\"I'd never seen a finer host for parasites... In less than thirty seconds, she would be sitting close enough for her fleas to change their address), gets in trouble all the time, and can't read.  But Sarah, unlike Franklin, is privy to a host of fabulous hopes and dreams.  And without meaning to, without WANTING to, Franklin finds that if the statistic that states that people who have friends live longer is true, he may soon be set for life.<br /><br />Stauffacher walks a fine line throughout this book.  It might be very easy to interpret the character of Donuthead as someone suffering from OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder).  The fact that the kid has to sing the happy birthday song three times when he washes his hands, and must start over again if she looses track of the song, is evidence enough.  But this isn't a story about OCD.  Franklin's supposed to be funny, so we must assume that his peculiar tendencies are self-inflicted and not the result of some kind of disorder.  This is not, suffice it to say, \\"As Good As It Gets\\" for kids.  And Donuthead is funny.  He talks like a forty-year-old British accountant and treats his mother more like a child than like a parent.  He's also funny to listen to.  Some of the best parts of this book occur when Franklin calls up Gloria for advice that goes above and beyond National Safety.  As a disembodied voice, Gloria represents an adult that Franklin can respect.  She also offers him some of the sanest advice in the book, and knows exactly how to talk to a guy who's own mother can't quite figure him out.<br /><br />The book's rather remarkable in that its hero is a child of a sperm donor.  His mom is a single-parent, something that we still don't see much of in children's literature even today.  Sometimes, it's a little difficult to understand what Stauffacher's trying to say about non-violence and not liking sports.  Franklin finds himself thrown into conflicts and unpleasant sports because other people want him to.  I think we're supposed to want him to too, but I had a little more respect for poor Donuthead than that.  If the boy doesn't want to learn how to hit a baseball don't make him for crying out loud!<br /><br />Probably one of the things I liked best about this book was the ending.  Not only is the last line in the book the kind ofthing that'll put shivers down your spine, but it suggests that a sequel would not be out of place.  I would, personally, adore a \\"Donuthead 2\\".  We'll see if Stauffacher's up for it.  If you need a book that reads aloud really really well to large groups of children, this book has it all.  A pitiable yet likable protagonist.  Really funny dialogue and scenes.  And an ending that gives you, if nothing else, hope.

For quite some time I have, for reasons of my own, been trying to find fictional books for children in which statues comes to life.  The few titles I've been able to find are scattered.  It was, therefore, will great delight that I discovered the completely forgotten but surprisingly well-written, \\"Stoneflight\\" by Georgess McHargue.  Set in the Morningside Heights area of Manhattan, the story follows a girl with a startling ability, and the remarkably normal homelife from which she hopes to escape.<br /><br />It isn't that Janie doesn't love her parents.  It's just that it's obvious that no one in her family has been happy for a very long time.  Her mother is constantly laboring under the mistaken belief that once the family gets some recognition, they'll all be happy.  Her father harbors modest ambitions that grate with his wife's newfound hopes and dreams.  Janie, lonely and bored over a summer where all her friends have gone away, is caught directly in the middle of the two of them.  She finds herself continually escaping to the rooftop, where she spends her days cleaning a beautiful stone griffin that sits on guard there.  It almost feels natural to Janie when she finds that she has the ability to bring Griff (as she has named him) to life beneath her hand.  Now Janie's problems are far behind her as she swoops and soars on Griff's back at night over the New York skyline.  It's only when she attempts to bring about a gathering of all the stone creatures in New York City that Janie discovers that sometimes being a soft malleable human with the ability to be hurt is a good thing.<br /><br />It's funny, but when you read plot synopsis' (not mine) of this book, they all tend to mention an exciting climactic threat that appears literally 20 pages before the book is done.  This is because the book isn't quite so hot on the whole bad guy thing.  This is a book of delicate family relations.  In such a light, New York statues coming to life almost seems a kind of afterthought.  Originally written in 1975, McHargue's choice of overshadowing Janie's tale with the prospect of divorce was probably rather daring at the time.  The fact that this divorce never goes through isn't important.  Instead, Janie's journey and slow acceptance of the fact that adults very rarely know what they are doing, is well-thought out and written.  There's a great deal of intelligence to her tale.  So when you see her jump on the back of a griffin and fly high and wide, it almost jars.  I know that in all good fantasy tales the fantastical elements of the story should be taken with a bite of reality.  Just the same, it seems that McHargue has attempted a new kind of \\"Wrinkle In Time\\" (which she quotes from liberally) but with more emphasis on the parental elements than the bringing-stone-to-life situation.<br /><br />Personally, I found myself continually delighted by the locations in this book.  This is probably because I live in Morningside Heights.  I know exactly where Janie was probably living during the events in this tale.  I've viewed the statues she \\"quickens\\".  I've even entered the Morningside Heights Library mentioned more than once in the context of the tale.  Of course, I had to wonder whether or not these same details would make the book LESS accessible to a kid in rural Alabama who picked it up on a lark.  Illustrator Arvis Stewart obviously is New York based as well.  When we see Griff perched above the city, he is facing in the correct direct (with the river on his left) and in such a way that certain confusing elements of the plot suddenly fall into place.  This is the work of an illustrator who has read every word in this book and has made the corresponding pictures as accurate as possible.  Arvis apparently was much enamored of that wacky wavy-lined drawing style so popular in the early 70s because this book comes across at certain times like a misplaced scene from \\"Yellow Submarine\\".  They're fun pictures and I think kids could definitely still get something out of them, but for some adults they'll be instant time machines to a mighty groovy era.<br /><br />You know a book is old when the narrator briefly mentions the \\"new\\" World Trade Center.  In spite of this (and the book's current forgotten state), \\"Stoneflight\\" is well worth remembering.  It has just as much oomph and pizzazz as it did when it first came out.  Though it lingers a little too long on its human elements, no one can accuse this book of not grounding its fantasy in plain good sense.

You never know what the heck he's gonna do next.  Some authors, like Demi, have a single style and do not waver from it, come hell or high water.  Mr. Young is different.  Some days he feels like doing a picture book full of colorful blind mice.  Other days he's more interested in retelling of Little Red Riding Hood but in a Chinese vein.  He is also, I must add, an inconsistent creator.  He's just as likely to produce a stunning, \\"Lon Po Po\\" as he is a dreadful \\"Turkey Girl\\" or a so-so, \\"Sons of the Dragon King\\".  To be frank, this is what I like about him.  Young's unpredictable.  A loose canon.  I was, therefore, delighted to pick up \\"I, Doko\\".  I knew it was an unusual offering, but also just as likely to be stunning as ridiculous.  After a quick read, I can state with zero hesitation that this book falls squarely into the \\"stunning\\" camp.  Young may not know where his next book is going to lead him, but if it's anywhere near the direction you find in \\"I, Doko\\", he'll be doing well.<br /><br />The book is told from the point of view of a basket or \\"doko\\".  In Nepal, this doko explains its role in a family's life.  It is bought by its master, Yeh-yeh and used to carry babies, food, kindling wood, and eventually Yeh-yeh's deceased wife Nei-nei.  Yeh-yeh has a son who grows quickly into a man and who starts his own family.  The doko reports happy occasions like weddings and births in which it plays a special part.  Unfortunately Yeh-yeh is growing old and can no longer help in the fields.  He spends his time instead growing close to his grandson Wangal.  One day, Wangal and Yeh-yeh overhear Wangal's father (Yeh-yeh's son) telling his wife that the next day he will leave his aging father on the nearest temple steps so that the priests can take care of him from now on.  The grandfather and grandson (and basket) are distraught at this news but can think of no way to save Yeh-yeh.  The next morning, the doko carries Yeh-yeh on his son's back to the temple when Wangal asks his father to be sure to bring the doko back.  When asked why he replies that when it is time for HIS father to be put on the temple steps, the basket will again prove useful.  Stunned, the father brings Yeh-yeh home again and, \\"Wangal's love and respect for his grandfather inspired and transformed the whole village in how to treat elders\\".<br /><br />I can see farsighted grandparents already purchasing this book for their wide-eyed grandchildren in the hopes that the modern equivalent of the temple steps (i.e. nursing homes) be avoided as a result.  In a little note at the beginning of the book, Young states that this book was, \\"Adapted from a folktale appearing in various forms in Nepal and in many other Asian countries, most often conveyed in the oral vernacular\\".  You may rest assured that this translation from an oral tale into the written word has not suffered the text one jot.  Young writes this story with a steady hand and the fact that we are hearing this story from the mouth (?) of a basket is both original and effective.<br /><br />Complimenting the text are Young's illustrations, which are stunning.  Sometimes a good picture book contains a single striking illustration that the reader keeps returning to again and again and again.  In Jane Yolen's, \\"Owl Moon\\" it's the first direct shot of an owl.  In, \\"I, Doko\\", it is the picture of the father being told by his son that he may one day suffer the same fate as the parent on his back.  His eyes overflow with shocked/hurt tears and reflected in them is the image of his son, arms stretched imploringly out to him.  I've sat for minutes on end contemplating this picture and I am certain that children will do the same.  The rest of the pictures aren't anything to scoff over, of course.  Young renders these pages in gouache, pastel and collage, not afraid to punctuate the borders and important elements of his tale with a bright gleaming gold.  The doko is often splattered with paint, thereby allowing its collage body a chance to look handdrawn.

I think we've all seen the toys-come-to-life-when-we're-not-around fantasy in roughly 70 millions different forms of media over the years.  Far less common, but no less a part of children's daily lives, are stories in which kids pretend to be superheroes.  They exist, but few are so carefully thought out and amusingly illustrated as George \\"First Book\\" O'Connor.  Choosing to present his picture book in a graphic novel style (and earning himself a mention at the New York 2005 Book Fest as a result) \\"Kapow!\\" is a novel telling of three kids, their world of make-believe, and the consequences of major roughhousing.  It's not a particularly original idea or a huge departure from already existing picture book superhero tales (like \\"The Adventures of Sparrowboy\\" or \\"Traction Man Is Here!\\"), but it's probably going to be VERY beloved of certain children in certain households.<br /><br />A small boy is playing with his blocks when, with a simple removal of his jacket, he becomes the muscly chin-clefted American Eagle.  Joining up with fellow superhero Bug Lady, the two ignore his mother's warning against getting too into their play and trap a dangerous panther (or housecat, depending on how you look at it) in a cage (washbasket).  Then it's off to stop The Rubber Bandit from robbing the First National Bank.  At this point, however, things get a little too crazy.  In the midst of the heroes epic battle a bookcase plummets to the floor.  Now it's up to American Eagle to do something actually heroic.  Will he tell the truth to his mom, or will he succumb to the temptation to lie?  Tune in to learn more this week in the exciting picture book extravaganza, \\"Kapow!\\".<br /><br />Like fellow fearless cartoony illustrator Kevin O'Malley (author of \\"Lucky Leaf\\" amongst others), Mr. O'Connor is not afraid to place his story within a contemporary setting.  Some author/illustrators chicken out when it comes to books of this nature and feel safer placing their story in the 1950s, or some such silliness.  O'Connor, however, isn't afraid to contemporize his tale.  The mom of the American Eagle kid reminded me a little of the mom in Bob Graham's, \\"Let's Get a Pup, Said Kate\\" but with less tattoos.  And she's still doing laundry, so don't expect any breaks from stereotypical gender roles or anything.  There are fun little details within the seemingly straightforward story though.  While the book never comes on out and says it, I suspect that the poor kid wrangled into being the Rubber Bandit is probably American Eagle's little brother.  Try removing the cover and comparing the picture underneath to the one printed on the cover too.  Also, I was happy to find that American Eagle's duckish baseball cap never changes expression, though the mouth below it (his mouth) might.<br /><br />The leaps between viewing these heroes as spandex-wrapped adults and costume-laden kids will be enough in and of themselves to garner a fan base.  It's nice to note that the story is a pretty amusing one as well.

These could be an entire genre in and of themselves.  Whether you're reading the highly acclaimed, \\"Traction Man Is Here!\\" by Mimi Grey, \\"The Wolves In the Walls\\" by Neal Gaiman, or \\"Lucky Leaf\\" by Kevin O'Malley, you know just how appealing these titles can be to those kids that love comic books and comic strips.  Some of the best stories are ones where the hero of the picture book is a normal everyday kid with extraordinary powers.  Enter, \\"The Adventures of Sparrowboy\\".  Light on text but long on last-minute saves and super powers, the story is an amusing little tale of a paperboy turned hero.  It's not Pinkney's best work and it certainly doesn't have much of what you might call \\"a plot\\", but it's an interesting little tale with enough flights of fancy to appeal to some of the reluctant child readers out there.<br /><br />Average everyday kid-about-town Henry always makes sure to read the comics of his papers before he delivers them.  His favorite strip is one entitled, \\"Falconman\\".  In it, a state trooper is given the power of flight from an otherwise everyday falcon, but must return those powers to the bird after he's finished his super rescues.  Henry doesn't think much about it until a sudden encounter with a small sparrow creates a very similar transfer.  Now Henry can fly, a talent he puts to immediate use so as to save kids from angry dogs, a cat from a bully, and a small sparrow from various near-death experiences.  It's only when he's saved the sparrow for the third time that he realizes where his newfound powers come from.  By the end of the tale, the papers have been delivered and boy and sparrow are back to normal.  Still, the final shot of the mysterious sparrow perched on a tree to regard the boy suggests future adventures may occur someday.<br /><br />The plot's a little weak, as is the writing for this story.  Pinkney's grasp on the kind of text written in a comic book is a little too simplistic (and reliant on bad puns) to really convey the true nature of a graphic novel.  Still, there are lots of ideas in this book that carry through well.  The book reads like a normal picture book right up until Henry gets the power of flight.  After that point, the book is broken up into comic book panels.  No speech bubbles, though.  All words are instead boxed in at the bottom of each page.  I was particularly interested in the fact that after Henry saves two little neighbor boys and a cat, he must then in turn save the sparrow from THEM.  It would have been nice if Henry had mentioned something about how the people he saves eventually try to do bad things too, but this isn't that cerebral a picture book.<br /><br />I was also a little astonished at Pinkney's choice of illustration technique.  There's probably no children's book artist as adept at the scratchboard technique as Mr. Pinkney.  Still, I felt that this wasn't the best possible art for this kind of a book.  Scratchboard works especially well for books like, \\"Sukey and the Mermaid\\", where the story is a kind of fairy/folk tale.  Here, however, it becomes clear that if this book is going to look like a comic book then the illustrations should look like the kind you read in the funny pages.  It would have been great if Pinkney, when Henry gets his powers, suddenly changed his illustration technique from scratchboard to pen and inks or something equally different.  Nothing so creative happens in this book, however.  Instead we have a lovely artistic style that is incongruous with the overall tone of the story.<br /><br />I feel like I'm putting \\"The Adventures of Sparrowboy\\" down too much, and I don't mean to.  I love the fact that we finally have a comic book-style picture book with an African-American hero out there for kids to read.  I just wish the book could have been better, or at least a little more creative.  As it is, Pinkney did as good of a job as he could.  So while this book is by no means his best work, at least it's amusing.  Kids will adore it, especially if they try to find the sparrow on every two page spread.  Parents will find it a cute little story.  Recommended with a sigh.ing.  Kids will adore it, especially if they try to find the sparrow on every two page spread.

Like so many other children's books, Amazon.com takes a perverse pleasure in lumping together all version's of Dylan Thomas's, \\"A Child's Christmas In Wales\\".  So if a reviewer, like myself, wants to review the book that was illustrated in 2004 by Chris Raschka, I'd better make it as clear as possible right from the start.  So here it goes.  Ahem.  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it gives me the greatest of pleasure to announce that I will now be reviewing \\"A Child's Christmas In Wales\\", penned by the great Dylan Thomas and illustrated with grace, aplomb, and a  hint of frenzy by accomplished children's book illustrator Chris Raschka.  Thank you.<br /><br />If you, like myself, have gone most of your natural life in ignorance of this story, I'll try to summarize it here.  Problem is, summarizing \\"A Child's Christmas In Wales\\" is akin to herding cats.  This isn't one of those books with a neat little beginning, middle, and end.  There's not what you might call \\"a plot\\".  If the book is ever summarized anywhere it's simply stated that this is Thomas's reminisces of Christmas when he was a child.  In doing so, the poet fills this relatively short work with patches of memory, amazing descriptions, and evocative sentences like, \\"The wind through the trees made noises as of old and unpleasant and maybe webfooted men wheezing in caves\\".  If you're looking for a straightforward Christmas tale with characters, a plot, and a point, go get yourself a copy of \\"The Best Christmas Pageant Ever\\" and enjoy it.  If, on the other hand, you would like to begin a tradition in your family of reading aloud this magnificent and truly beautiful collection of evocative images, this the only place to go.<br /><br />There is no tradition in my family of listening or reading this story during the holiday time of year.  In fact, prior to reading this book with Raschka's illustrations, I had never even heard so much as a phrase from it.  Basically I came to this book as a clean slate.  I was just a former college English major with some mild associations with Dylan but certainly no baggage of any kind.  Not knowing the history behind the book, I was under the vague and misguided belief that Dylan had written this tale with the full intent that it be a children's book.  Not so much.  According to the helpful Foreward at the beginning of this tale, I learned that this book was actually a combination of two separate pieces produced during Thomas's lifetime and put together after.  So this isn't like when Michael Chabon or Joyce Carol Oates writes a children's book.  More like when Woody Guthrie songs are turned into picture books.  A posthumous and lucrative printing.<br /><br />For the child that has never heard this story read before, I found that Raschka was a perfect fit.  Certainly I understand that the book has, in the past, been illustrated by the great Trina Schart Hyman.  Hyman, however, is a very literal illustrator.  She's excellent at realism and intricate characters, but how well does that work when she's paired with Mr. Thomas?  This is a book that contains lines like, \\"All the Christmases roll down toward the two-tongued sea, like a cold and headlong moon bundling down the sky that was our street; and they stop at the rim of the ice-edged, fish-freezing waves, and I plunge my hands in the snow and bring out whatever I can find\\".  Hyman doesn't even bother to deal with sentences like that one.  Raschka is another matter entirely.  Using a gouache, ink, and torn paper technique, the man who brought the world the manic, \\"John Coltrane's Giant Steps\\" has finally met his authorial match.  The sentence I just wrote above is accompanied by a snowblown seaside town, so filled with cresting waves and freezing snow that you shiver just looking at it.  These are pictures that work on the reader's emotions.  I have all the respect in the world for Hyman or even Edward Ardizzone, but as accomplished as they are, they're not the right fit.  Raschka is.<br /><br />I was a little baffled by the blurb on the cover of this version of the tale that read, \\"This beautifully illustrated edition should bring Dylan Thomas's work to a new generation of children\\" - President Jimmy Carter.  I'm a Carter fan myself, but even I can't see what this perfectly nice former president has to do with poetry, children's literature, or even Christmas itself.  It might have been better to put a blurb by the Number 1 poet in America.  Problem is, who is that person?  And would anyone buy a book if they recommended it?  These problems aside, it's wonderful for me to hold this book in my hands and know that at long last a great problem has been corrected.  Thomas's book has existed for years without proper packaging.  Raschka single-handedly has corrected this problem and the world is a better place for it.  So thank you, Mr. Raschka.

I had always meant to get around to reading a selection from the \\"Zack Files\\" oeuvre, but somehow the inclination never seemed to strike me.  As a children's librarian, I'd watch the kids greedily snap up all the new \\"Zack Files\\" paperbacks I'd purchased for the library like they were some kind of surrealistic popcorn.  It wasn't until I found myself processing one of these books that I allowed my eyes to fall on the title.  \\"Elvis the Turnip and Me\\".  Huh.  On the cover our hero Zack holds a turnip that bears a striking resemblance to The King.  I was amused.  I was intrigued.  So, sensing that if I was ever going to read a review a \\"Zack File\\" this would have to be the one, I plucked the book up.  The reading took roughly fifteen minutes.  Twenty tops.  At the end I realized (as reviewers prior to myself have already done) that this isn't a very plot-heavy book exactly but it does indeed do what it set out to.  It amuses.  And sometimes in the world of children's paperback series, that's more than anybody could ask.<br /><br />Zack wakes up one night to nip a nighttime snack from the kitchen.  He father, much to his chagrin, has recently begun a kind of health-food craze within the family and as a result our hero is desperate for junk food of any kind.  On opening the fridge door to get some pop, there's no mistaking the sound coming from he vegetable bin.  Something is singing \\"You Ain't Nothin' But a Hound Dog\\" in there.  Zack's quick to discover that the singer is a turnip.  A turnip named Elvis that knows all kinds of songs but doesn't crave the spotlight.  Zack's eager to show Elvis the sights of New York, but in their travels they attract the attention of a nefarious Elvis collector.  A man who will stop at nothing to procure his very own vegetable King.  Nothing.<br /><br />Archly conservative parents that disapprove of the notion of reincarnation, no matter how silly, can lay their little hearts to rest.  The turnip, as it happens, is not Elvis redux.  He's just a turnip who happens to sound and look and act like The King.  No biggie.  The plot, as such, ain't much.  There is a brief bout of veggie-napping, but it's over within, literally, two pages.  There's also a rather bizarre meeting with David Letterman that suggests (oddly) that the people who appear on his show are paid large amounts of money.  I bet Mr. Letterman would be delighted to hear that.<br /><br />Charm can carry you quite a ways, and in this \\"Elvis the Turnip and Me\\" has it in spades.  Unfortunately it's not enough.  This is a fun book in a fun series but nobody could get away with believing that this is great literature.  All in all, amusing without ever making a whole lotta sense..

People warned me not to reread, \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\".  Oh, it's way too simplistic!  Oh, it's way too didactic!  Oh, it's way too.... you get the picture.  Admittedly, I hadn't picked up the book since my mother first read it to me (with the exceedingly beautiful illustrations of Michael Hague) when I was five or six.  Doing so now, I was astounded to find that not only is the book an exercise in writing a perfect little children's tale but that the religious elements, while present, are there if you need them and not there if you don't.  In and of itself, this is the quintessential children's fantasy novel.  It has villains that can be redeemed, evil that cannot, a hero that is frightening and furry all at once, brave kids, and lovable characters.  The writing is brilliant, the descriptions delightful, and the book accessible to all kinds of kids, regardless of age or belief system.  A class act from a particularly classy writer.<br /><br />It's World War II and the children of London are being shipped out to the countryside to escape potential bombings.  To their delight, they find themselves arriving at a large mysterious mansion of a home.  A kindly professor rules the roost and the kids have fun exploring the place.  That's when Lucy, the youngest, decides to explore an old wardrobe sitting alone in one of the abandoned rooms.  Inside its door, Lucy discovers the land of Narnia and meets up with a faun by the name of Mr. Tummus.  When the other kids eventually discover Narnia as well (including the beastly Edmund) they discover its curse, its self-proclaimed queen, and a lion named Aslan who will save them all.<br /><br />Here's what I love about this story.  First of all, it's undoubtedly the most English children's book ever written.  I know that \\"Harry Potter\\" has a fair share of Britishisms, but there's nothing to compare to English children saying things like, \\"Sharp's the word!\\".  I wonder to myself how many hundreds of thousands of people alive today can remember how much they wanted to try Turkish Delight after reading this tale (and how many, once they did, were disappointed).  Narnia is a perfect little paradise of mannerisms.  People have tea all the time and giants speak with comfortable cockney accents (complete with calling Aslan, \\"your honor\\".  Another thing I loved about the book was the number of details I hadn't noticed as a child.  How many papers have been written regarding the White Witch's striking similarity to Hans Christian Anderson's, \\"Snow Queen\\"?  Also, I had no idea that the Witch was supposed to be a descendent of Lilith and not Eve.  Finally, I enjoyed discovering on this latest reading that perhaps Edmund's personality could (in part) be blamed on the old British boarding school system.<br /><br />Is this book perfect?  Goodness me, no.  It's dated in all sorts of ways.  Perhaps the most striking problem comes in the form of Father Christmas himself.  The appearance of Santa Claus in the middle of the book brilliantly ties an otherwise incongruous element of Christmas to the original myth.  The problem comes with Saint Nicholas goes about handing presents to the four children.  He hands Peter a sword and shield (ooooh... aaaah) then gives weapons to the girls as well with careful instructions to never use them.  Say what?  Father Christmas (and, by extension, Mr. Lewis himself) justifies their lack of use by saying, \\"battles are ugly when women fight\\".  I suppose they're downright civilized otherwise, right?  And how are we to deal with the fact that the Witch fights?  Little jarring elements like this crop up occasionally throughout the story.  Fortunately, they're few and far between.  Nothing so large as to detract from the otherwise remarkable nature of the storytelling.<br /><br />J.R.R. Tolkien once complained that his friend Lewis didn't put enough work into creating an alternate fantasyland.  After all, Narnia hasn't its own written language or culture or highly specialized geography.  For all of Tolkien's sneers, the book has worked itself deeply within the public consciousness.  Even to this day, elements of this tale remain with me.  I remember always being deeply disturbed by the fact that the children grow up in Narnia, become old, then stumble through the wardrobe and become kids again.  Wouldn't that do something to your head?  Sounds more like a Charlie Kaufman conceit than an element in a children's book.  But it's hard not to love Narnia.  No matter what version you read, no matter who has done the illustrations or how large or small the book is, this is truly a story for everyone.  A must-read for every speaker of the English language.re or highly specialized geography.  For all of Tolkien's sneers, the book has worked itself deeply within the public consciousness.

Jones\\" books and has gobbled up the entire \\"Amber Brown\\" series without so much as breathing, it can be hard to know where to go next.  The answer is a series that I like to consider child-driven.  You'll never hear adult praising the magnificence of \\"Judy Moody\\" books.  Parents don't think to recommend her and educators have entirely missed out on her appearance in their students' hands.  Kids, however, request her by name.  They ask frantically where the \\"Judy Moody\\" books can be found and heaven help you if you're a children's librarian caught not knowing who she is.  I, for the longest time, sort of lumped her together with the \\"Molly Moon\\" books (which I had also not read).  A quick perusal of both was enough to cure me of THAT little quirk.  Now when a kid asks me for \\"Judy Moody\\" stories, I know they're just looking for books about an average little girl who has some normal adventures and some extraordinary spunk.<br /><br />Judy wakes up the first day of school in a mood.  \\"Not a good mood.  A bad mood.  A mad-face mood\\".  Fortunately, there's more to the story than that.  Meeting your heroine right off the bat when she's woken up on the wrong side of the bed doesn't show you the good side of Judy initially.  At first, she's a cranky crochety gal who's little brother bugs her, who makes fun of her teacher's name, and who can't stand her eternal crushee, Frank Pearl.  \\"Ever since they had danced the Maypole together in kindergarten, this boy would not leave her alone\\".  Fortunately, teacher Mr. Todd has a wonderful assignment for the class.  They are to make a Me collage.  On it, they will show items that explain who they are as a person.  Judy is intrigued and the book follows her as she sets off to figure out what her favorite pet is (*hint* it's green, has teeth, and finds spiders delicious), what the worst thing to happen to her was, what she finds funny, etc.  Along the way, Judy learns that there's more to Frank Pearl than meets the eye and that even her brother's mistakes can be turned into something good.<br /><br />There is nothing about Megan McDonald's creation to necessarily set her apart from the pack.  She doesn't have divorced parents like \\"Amber Brown\\" or deal with issues in any way.  Judy isn't as young as \\"Junie B. Jones\\" either, so her problems are a little more mature.  The thing about Judy is that she's got personality.  Judy likes to use the word, \\"rare\\" rather than \\"cool\\", which actually kinda works.  She collects things obsessively and when she is not feeling particularly perky she shows it by proclaiming, \\"ROAR\\".  I enjoyed the sections in which Judy interacted with her brother and Frank Pearl.  Her brother does typical annoying-little-brother stuff, but McDonald sometimes (and unexpectedly) takes his side when Judy acts just a bit too mean.  Likewise, Frank Pearl turns out to be a pretty cool guy, if you ignore the fact that he once ate paste on a dare.<br /><br />For those kids who haven't quite graduated onto the \\"Anastasia Krupnik\\" books of Lois Lowry or the \\"Alice\\" series by Phyllis Naylor, \\"Judy Moody\\" fills a gap.

I don't think you can truly understand the undercurrent of panic that runs beneath, \\"Hush: A Thai Lullaby\\" unless you've taken care of a sleeping baby sometime in your past.  There comes a time when that sweet moment of pure uninterrupted silence is so golden, so impermanent and yet perfect, that you would gladly have conversations with any number of mosquitoes, mice, or monkeys just to sustain it.  Such is the slightly panicked and oh-so-slightly fevered current of feeling running beneath Minfong Ho's 1997 Caldecott Honor winner.  We've all read our share of lullaby books.  Now let's read one that brings a share of interesting animals, rhythmic lyrics, and beautiful illustrations as well as a cultural background based in Thailand.  Sound lovely?  It is.<br /><br />A Thai mother has just placed her sleeping child in a comfy hammock when she hears a mosquito crying in the wind.  Softly, the mother whispers, \\"Mosquito, mosquito, don't come weeping.  Can't you see that Baby's sleeping?  Mosquito, mosquito, don't you cry, my baby's sleeping right nearby\\".  Apparently this method of skeeter removal works, since we never hear from that bug again.  But as soon as one critter quiets, another starts up a new racket.  With the mosquito silent, a lizard pipes up.  Then a cat, then a mouse, then a frog, then a pig, then a ... you get the picture.  Each time someone new gives a cry, the mama sings her baby tune, unaware that her child has used her distraction to explore some parts of the house.  By the end everyone is quiet and the mama is dozing as well.  \\"Only Baby's wide awake, his eyes bright and round\\".<br /><br />There are a couple nice little details in this work.  First of all, I loved the new interpretations of animal sounds.  Schoolchildren are usually taught that pigs say, \\"oink oink\\".  How much more interesting (and accurate), therefore, to have them say, \\"uut-uut, uut-uut\\".  There's also the sense that the animals featured in this book are just your average everyday backyard creatures.  This may be true in Thailand, where water buffalos and elephants aren't strangers, but for Western children such thoughts are intoxicating.  Certainly there aren't that many Thai picture books out there, so it's nice to see such a rhythmic beauty as this gain a little spotlight.  The words are actually the biggest draw to this tale.  This isn't to say that artist Holly Meade has done a poor job.  Her rambling toddler provides much of the fun in this book.  It's just that if you're looking for cut-paper picture books you may be better off with the talents of David Wisniewski or Ed Young if you're hoping to be bowled over.<br /><br />Obviously if you're a fan of \\"Hush!\\" then you should probably find Minfong Ho's follow up picture book, \\"Peek!: A Thai Hide and Seek\\".  For those amongst you willing to make this a regular bedtime tale, the story is a wonderful sleepyheaded affair.  Definitely consider pairing it with fellow tiptoe picture book, \\"Bear Snores On\\", by Karma Wilson.eatures.

47607:US	49148452	R1BBSUAWZ4TRKA	0152046399	8515039	zoo's who	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A review of a sort.	No one can accuse poet Douglas Florian of being uninterested in the public opinion of his work.  Mr. Florian is one of the few relatively well-known children's writers out there who, by his own hand and without any interference on my part, was kind enough to ask me to review his book, \\"zoo's who\\" by e-mail.  I, a lowly Amazon.com reviewer, was somewhat amazed to receive his request (all the more so when I noticed that it was written in brightly colored verse).  I was reluctant initially, a reluctance that increased tenfold when I opened my most recent issue of School Library Journal and found that Mr. Florian had written a letter taking an SLJ reviewer to task for a) Incorrectly writing the title of his book with capital letters and b) not properly spacing the letters in his poem, \\"The Slugs\\", thereby nixing the point of the work.  The fact that the review was a positive one did not stop Mr. Florian from his critique.  Now I tend to write reviews of children's books with only the vaguest sense that the author may, at some time, care what I've written.  I have never received an angry e-mail from someone like Carmen Agry Deedy for my review of her gawdawful, \\"The Yellow Star\\" or from Marcus Pfister for his lamentable, \\"Rainbow Fish\\".  But then, I've never known for a fact that the author has or would, at some point, read what I've written.  So do I shrink from my responsibilities and refuse to review this book simply because I can't write three words without wondering if they are \\"nice\\"?  Do I shy away from this momentous occasion and leave the reviewing to somebody else?  No sir!  Onward I revieweth!<br /><br />It helps that I liked the book too.  Before you begin to sneer at me and say to yourself, \\"Well of COURSE she's not going to give the book a bad review (the coward)\\", I would like to note that Florian's books are of a very specific breed.  They are not going to appeal to every child of every persuasion.  The nine-year-old who fills their shelves with Shel Silverstein and (to a lesser extent) Jack Prelutsky is not going to immediately find a Florian unless directed to do so.  Mr. Florian is, to his credit, not one of those numerous Silverstein knock-offs you stumble over in the poetry section of the library room.  The man goes for grander visions.  Big sweeping pictures that involve watercolor, gouache, colored pencils, inks, tin foil, candy wrappers (I'm not making this up, you know), shredded papers, stencils, rubber stamps, and (to quote the book's back page), \\"much collage on primed brown paper bags\\".  The results are these ambitious animalian dreamscapes where the poems are merely half the final product.  Quite frankly, I incline more towards poetry books like,  \\"If Not For the Cat\\", but I can definitely see Florian's appeal.<br /><br />If you've read a Florian before than you know what to expect.  In this book we are treated to twenty-one poems of various wild creatures.  Everything from lowly insects, to man-eating sharks, to sleepy creeping sloths have their moment in the sun here.  It takes a while to get into the book, but once you do it's increasingly amusing.  Not laugh-your-socks-off amusing.  More mildly-chuckle-and-then-ponder-the-truth-in-the-writing amusing.  Some poems are plays on words.  The poem, \\"The Ant\\", consists of four panicked lines that read simply, \\"I wANTed to write / A poem on an ANT / I'm frANTic- / I cAN'T\\".  I won't even repeat the lines in the poem \\"The Terns\\" except to say that it's a groaner of a pun.  By the end, you find you've met a wide variety of critters in a surprising variety of ways.<br /><br />To my mind, Mr. Florian is at his best when he goes for something with a little atmosphere to it.  My favorite poem out of the bunch is, without question, \\"The Owl\\".  On the left-hand page are sixteen yellow pairs of eyes huddled on the floor of a deep dark forest.  Above them, glowing far larger are almost hypnotic peepers of a creature who proclaims, \\"I am the eyes / And ears of night/ The say I'm wise - / I say they're right\\".  You'll find yourself in shivers just staring at the inky blue/blackness of the picture for minutes on end.  You'll also find yourself returning to it.<br /><br />Will kids like this book?  Doggone it if I know.  I think that Mr. Florian's books work particularly well as writing exercises in schools and classrooms.  The teacher reads a bunch of his poems aloud (turning and twisting the books as necessary) then encourages the kids to write their own wild kingdom prose and pictures in his style.  Children do not, by and large, seek out poetry on their own unless they are looking for something silly.  Nevertheless, I suspect that in many households this book will be much beloved (and certain poems favored over others) for years and years to come.  A lovely offering and some unique takes.<br /><br />.... and.... we're done.of night / The say I'm wise - / I say they're right\\".

As a reviewer of children's books, I like to check out the competition.  In this particular case, \\"the competition\\" means other reviewers of children's books.  What I tend to do is read the book, read the reviews written about that book, and then make snide little comments to myself about that reviewer's choice of wording.  For example, when I finished reading the relatively still unappreciated author Theresa Nelson's best known work, \\"Ruby Electric\\" and then read a blurb from Kirkus Reviews that said, \\"Positively fizzes with emotion\\", I shook my head.  Had I been writing for Kirkus (gales of laughter waft over from the Kirkus editorial board) I would've said \\"crackles with emotion\\".  Not fizzes.  Because you see, this truly is a book where energetic high-energy words are the ones that apply to it best.  Nelson has penned a masterful book that could easily have come off as trite or the kind of book that takes cheap shots with the reader's emotions.  Instead, this is a story told with humor and compassion about how we come to grips with the truth, even when that truth is doing a tarantella on our heart.<br /><br />All parents try to shield their children from unpleasant things, but Ruby Miller's pretty sure she's been overly shielded all her life.  Her father disappeared when she was seven and no one's ever been able to adequately explain why she hasn't seen him since.  I mean, sure he's been calling her house and trying to set up dinner with his former wife, son Pete (he's four or five), and daughter Ruby.  But he never shows up.  Meanwhile, Ruby has to deal with two notorious and bubble-headed juvenile delinquents, one of whom (known mostly as Big Skinny) has been spray painting bright red love poems across the street from her house in her honor.  And then there's the fact that Ruby accidentally allowed Pete's beloved stuffed animal Mammook to be carted away by the Salvation Army.  Somehow though, Pete's sudden friendship with Big Skinny and Mouse and a project to paint a mural alongside the Los Angeles River coincides with Ruby's discovery of what truly happened with her father.  Throw in a talking parrot named Lord Byron and you've a book that can be called \\"heartwarming\\" without conjuring up the saccharine images that usually tag-along with that term.<br /><br />Normally in books like this, you get two options.  Either the main character is living in a world of fantasy (as Ruby occasionally is) and the whole point of the book is that they must come to grips with the real world OR the book is like \\"Monster\\" by Walter Dean Myers and everything in the novel is written in a screenplay format.  Nelson opts for neither of these, though admittedly Ruby does write multiple film scripts and screenplays, all of which carry interesting father/daughter relationships.  And Nelson has a way with language.  There's an offhand quality to the writing that'll once in a while zing you with a particularly smart repetition of ideas or a choice of wording that you wish you had been the one to think up.  This is difficult enough to do in adult literature.  Now imagine simplifying it for kids.  One of my favorite sections comes in a flashback of Ruby's mama after she'd been depressed for days.  \\"She opened the curtains and looked out the window.  Ruby came and stood beside her.  The fog had rolled in.  You could hardly see the ocean at all.  'Just wait,' her mother said.  'The sun's starting to work.  I bet you we'll have blue skies by ten.'  But the fog was thick, and Mama was wrong.  It took the sun till noon\\".  To my mind, this is the kind of writing ability that Kate DiCamillo and Joan Bauer should be selling their right femurs to have.  Ah well.<br /><br />Recently the great, now retired, editor Richard Jackson wrote in the September 2005 issue of School Library Journal that Ms. Nelson, \\"...uses her Texas voice distinctively, and in story after story, leads readers into unforeseen aspects of the heart\\".  Couldn't have put it plainer myself.Nelson knows how to write a book that's funny and sad and meaningful and downright ridiculous all at once and with seemingly little effort.  Consider me her newest convert.  For kids, \\"Ruby Electric\\" isn't going to call to them like \\"Eragon\\" or \\"Judy Moody\\", but, if you can find a way to get it into their hands, they're bound to really enjoy it.

Due to the fact that my library only carries Sesame Street videos that deal with holidays or sing songs, there wasn't much to offer.  But the patron's demand got me thinking.  Finding good materials that help children to read can be awfully difficult sometimes.  Books for early readers tend to be dull (like your average \\"Dick and Jane\\" fare) or facile.  There are exceptions to this rule, of course, and one of the most notable exceptions is the remarkable, \\"You Read To Me, I'll Read To You\\".  This is a book that has killed roughly four birds with a single stone.  It helps kids to read, rhymes beautifully, introduces them to a wide variety of fairy tales, and is funny.  Really honest-to-goodness funny.  This is a book that parents will not cringe to read over and over with their young 'uns.  Hoberman has given us a book that is going to be appreciated by a wide range of ages.  All that and it's a clever idea to boot.<br /><br />Here's the premise.  Each story in this book is a fairy tale.  Each fairy tale is a conversation between two characters.  It is meant to be read aloud by either two beginning readers or between a beginning and a more-advanced reader.  After picking their parts the readers alternate lines, rhyming all the while.  So, for example, in \\"The Three Bears\\" we have one reader say, \\"I'm Goldilocks\\" and another say \\"I'm Baby Bear\\".  \\"What pretty fur!\\".  \\"What pretty hair!\\".  You get the idea.  Anything written in blue is meant to be read by both readers at the same time and every poem/story ends with the lines, \\"You'll read to me!  I'll read to you!\\".  There are seven stories altogether and each one softens the original tale just a bit.  I was surprised to see references to the Grimm version of Cinderella as well as the original ending of The Three Little Pigs.  As it happens, however, no one gets eaten or hurt in these tales and in each case everyone ends the tale happily ever after.<br /><br />This is not the first edition of \\"You Read To Me, I'll Read To You\\" to grace shelves around the world, you know.  In fact, this book is a sequel to a predecessor of the same name that came out in 2001.  Inanely, both versions have their reviews linked together here at Amazon.com.  I'll state right here and now that this particular review that I am writing refers to the 2004 edition with the fairy tales in it.  Let's just clarify that little detail once and for all.<br /><br />Now the pairing of author Mary Ann Hoberman with illustrator Michael Emberley is nothing short of brilliant.  While Hoberman has the almost unnatural ability of simplifying stories down to their essential parts, tacking on happy endings without sounding preachy, AND adding humor as well, Emberley is just as adept at pictures that are adorable, simple, and full of delightful details.  Note that Jack in \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\" is decked out in an utterly mod outfit, complete with tiger-striped shirt and go-go boots.  Note also that when the third pig (at first) attempts to cook the wolf in a pot, he is holding a book called, \\"Cooking Lupine\\".  Visual gag, meet fabulous wordplay.  How do you do?  How do you do?<br /><br />So if a patron comes in asking me for a simple rhyming book that will help their child to read, I will be prepared.  I shall promote this book as loudly as my indoor-librarian-voice allows me to.  This is one of those rare buys that need to be touted widely to the public.

If you or I were to find a tiny hummingbird nest in our backyard, we would handle such a discovery in any variety of ways.  Some people would probably set up a camera and create a 24-hr live feed to their website.  Others would ignore the nest or, worse still, actively remove it due to some odd hummingbird-based-delusion that the creatures were pests.  When author Kristine O'Connell George found her nest, she came up with a particularly original way of marking the event.  She kept a steady journal and, when all was said and done, she turned that journal into poetry.  And she turned that poetry into a book.  And that book was illustrated by the all-too-accomplished Barry Moser.  And as a result, children's librarians everywhere have the honor of carrying \\"Hummingbird Nest\\" on their shelves, ready to be taken out by any inquisitive child with a yen for tiny birdies.  Neither you nor I might go this route, but then neither you nor I would have such a fine title to our name.  Such is life.<br /><br />There are 26 poems in this book, all told.  At the beginning a single small bird launches itself at a family eating on their patio.  It appears that the creature has claimed this area as its own and immediately sets about building a nest in a potted tree.  After a short amount of time two eggs appear in the nest.  The family carefully checks up on them when the mama bird is away.  The chicks hatch and are fed by their mother.  Then they grow over the course of 18-26 days.  At the end of that time, one of the babies flies away without the family ever saying goodbye.  The second bird has some false starts before it finally figures out how to fly, and (after a snack from mama) fly it does.  From that time on, hummingbirds sip nectar from the family's feeder and the author says to herself in the Author's Note, \\"Were any of the fledglings that turned up at our feeder later that spring our hummingbirds?  I like to think they were\\".<br /><br />The book has the feel of realism to it, helped along by Moser's accurate artistic renderings.  The poetry, for its part, is a kind of friendly free verse.  All scientifically accurate.  All tiny odes to greater hummingbird-dom.  I was particularly fond of a poem entitled, \\"Spiders, Beware!\\" that cautions all arachnids that the hummingbirds are around and ready to steal their webbing.  These poems are rather innocent and don't go in for witty metaphors or particularly original imagery.  They're just gentle little pieces that contain words like, \\"this rainy evening / your quiet wings / smoothly pressed / as you patiently sit / gentle captain / of your cobweb ship\\".  There's even a small hummingbird-ish haiku at the end (though for a superior hum-haiku, check out the one in Jack Prelutsky's, \\"If Not For the Cat\\").  At the end of the book is the Author's Note that tells the true story, some quick facts about hummingbirds, and a very nice bibliography of hummingbird resources for old and young readers.<br /><br />It's really Barry Moser's art that lifts this little book from obscurity, though.  If you haven't perused Moser's stunning, \\"In the Beginning\\" (with words by Virginia Hamilton) then I'm afraid you've a large gap in the creation-myth department of  your brain.  Moser's watercolors here are wonderful.  In the picture where the hummingbird dive-bombs the family, we see an older woman dropping her breakfast spoon, a coffee cup already turned on its side, and a hand covering her face in what is unmistakably the beginning of a laugh.  Moser's dog is mournful and his cat full of the languid grace of the species.  There are changes in perspective, in distance, and in view.  In this way, Moser creates what otherwise could have been a deathly dull series of illustrations.<br /><br />Come to think of it, this whole enterprise could easily (in the hands of the less adept) have ended up as some kind of boring practice in nature poetry.  Instead it captures a fascinating subject, those winged little paradoxes ofthe avian world, and displays for us all the wonder that she, the author, experienced once.  There won't be a child in the world who doesn't yearn for a hummingbird nest of their own after paging through this light little book.  Seriously consider pairing it with the equally lovely and aforementioned, \\"If Not For the Cat\\", for a detailed examination of the natural world through verse.  A small but strong work.tle paradoxes of the avian world, and displays for us all the wonder that she, the author, experienced once.

Atmosphere is a difficult thing to create in a children's book.  Because of the nature of writing for children, most authors give their stories a kind of one-dimensional feel.  I best knew of Alan Ahlberg as a picture book writer, prior to finding this tale.  He wrote adorable stories like (I kid you not), \\"The Little Cat Baby\\".  Weirder still, \\"The Little Cat Baby\\" came out at the same time as \\"The Improbable Cat\\".  It's as if Ahlberg wanted to tell the same story but through two entirely different lenses.  \\"Cat Baby\\" is all sweetness and light and cuddly adorablenesses.  \\"Improbable Cat\\", on the other hand, is made up of darkness and insanity and mood and horror.  In spite of its small size, this is a book for kids between fourth and sixth grade.  It's an exercise in atmosphere.<br /><br />Writing years later, our hero in this book is twelve-year-old David Burrell.  He lives a pretty normal life with his librarian father, part-time teacher mom, and typical annoying little sister Josie.  One day, while the rest of the family is outside, a small kitten limps into the backyard looking oh-so-cute.  David is allergic to cats and during its arrival he stays in his room.  He cannot help but notice that there's something odd about the animal.  Once the family has petted it and taken it inside, it stops limping.  It never meows or purrs, \\"or, as far as I could see, even washed itself\\".  There's something definitely wrong with this cat.  There's something wrong with Billy's family too.  They start to change.  They spend all their free time buying the cat elaborate meals, stroking it, and playing television shows that it likes.  When they aren't doing these things they're distracted, acting like hypnotized goons rather than a real loving family.  So when David leaves for camp for a week, he is entirely unprepared for the horror he comes back to find.<br /><br />This book would make an excellent writing exercise for kids, since much of the book is left shadowy.  The true nature of the cat (or, more accurately, cat-like creature) is never fully explained.  Whatever it might be, our best view of it comes from David's opening statement that, \\"...most kittens become cats (if they live long enough), don't they?  The odds on a kitten not becoming a cat are huge, but not impossible maybe\\".  Whatever it is, this book is best described as a light horror-fest.  If you have kids that gobble down \\"Goosebumps\\" books and you want to put something with a little more meat and depth on their plate, try this title.<br /><br />Actually, I'm a little surprised \\"The Improbable Cat\\" isn't better known.  It's very British (there's lots of talk about \\"lorries\\") and contains far more swearing than the average kiddie fare.  I don't think this is particularly damaging as I personally find violence far more damaging than \\"s***\\" and other dirty words.  Still, parents overeager to ban whatever doesn't strike them as pure and innocent would undoubtedly be delighted to burn this shadowy title if it ever came to their attention.  Don't let them, kids!

He's not that kind of writer.  Still, if you want something definitely dark, give \\"The Improbably Cat\\" a whirl.

He's not that kind of writer.  Still, if you want something definitely dark, give \\"The Improbably Cat\\" a whirl.  It's definitely a pro-dog book, but acknowledges that darkness we sometimes sense in our pets.  Good stuff.	2005-09-15

When I first read Galdone's work I was shocked at the sloppiness and the grotesqueness of it all.  His \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" did nothing for me and his \\"The Monkey and the Crocodile\\" makes me shudder to this day.  Even \\"Henny Penny\\" fared badly under his pen.  I labeled myself a Galdone-hater and left it at that.  Then I read his \\"Cat Goes Fiddle-I-Fee\\" and it all began to slowly change.  If nothing else, Galdone does cats really well.  So \\"Puss In Boots\\" fares well and his \\"Cinderella\\"... well, let's just say that I've seen worse.  The real test, in the end, became \\"The Three Bears\\".  If Galdone could show me a convincing version of the Goldilocks tale, I was willing to concede that perhaps he wasn't the hack I'd always made him out to be.  And as luck would have it, the book isn't as bad as I had feared.  Certainly the previous reviewer who used the word \\"garish\\" was on the right track.  But in this book Galdone has figured out exactly what children want out of their fairy tales, and he knows how to give it to them.  This isn't a picture book that's about pleasing grown-ups with its urbane wit.  It's about pleasing kids with its language, great story, and bright easy-to-follow pictures.<br /><br />I'm not going to bother summing up the story for you.  If you know the basics then you know what to find in this book.  The bears are interesting partly because they're not called \\"Mama\\" or \\"Papa\\" but instead are labeled as \\"Middle-Sized\\" and \\"Great Big\\".  Far be it from me to suggest how to read this title, but if you know a gay couple with a single child, this is an ideal purchase for them.  Goldilocks, for her part, is truly frightening.  Kids won't be scared of her.  I was.  There's something about that first image of her when you meet her on page ten.  Her eyes are a little bit glazed.  Her missing tooth (I had to inspect my copy just to make sure it wasn't missing due to some skillful kid's pen) may be intended to make her appear innocent.  She ends up instead looking half-deranged.  I liked that.  From there on in, Goldilocks swings between cartoonish buffoonery and innocent glee.  Dressed in a blue dress not all that dissimilar from Wonderland's Alice, this adventurer wreaks havoc without a care in the world.  Her comeuppance is a bit dark as well.  After seeing her bearish hosts, the girl escapes out the window and the book states (ominously), \\"No one knows what happened to Goldilocks after that\\".  No one?  Woah.<br /><br />Obvious pairings with this title, if you feel like having a Three Bears storytime, would include that wonderful read-aloud, \\"Dusty Locks and the Three Bears\\" by Susan Lowell or maybe the lovely \\"Goldie and the Three Bears\\" by the accomplished Diane Stanley.

I'll say a word and you tell me the first thing that pops into your brain.  Ready?  Okay, here it goes... FROG.  What'd you come up with?  Probably something like \\"green\\" or \\"warty\\" or \\"ribbit\\".  If you were feeling particularly creative you may have said \\"kiss\\" or \\"Kermit\\" or \\"delicious\\".  It's safe to say that one word that did not enter your brain was \\"gleeful\\".  \\"Tricky\\" also didn't make the cut, I'm certain and \\"smart-alecky\\" was probably farthest from your mind.  Yet after reading Verna Aardema's remarkable, \\"Who's In Rabbit's House\\", these  were the words I derived after a single reading.  It's a remarkable story, and if nothing else, this is one book that'll give its child readers a whole new appreciation of froggy-kind.<br /><br />What we have here is a play within a play.  In this book, a group of Masai actors don animal masks and prepare for a performance of some kind.  At first, we see them getting ready and we view their audience as well.  Once the play starts a small prologue at the beginning of the book puts it best when it says that, \\"the perspective shifts and he reader becomes the real audience to this unique performance\\".  Better still, the animal masks take on a new life of their own, showing all sorts of emotions that they would not have displayed otherwise.  The story may be a familiar one to you.  This particular version comes from the Masai tale, \\"The Long One\\" found in author Aardema's collection, \\"Tales For the Third Ear From Equatorial Africa\\".  In the tale, a rabbit leaves its home and then comes back to find it locked up.  Inside, a voice roars that it is The Long One, that it can eat trees, and that it is particularly skillful at trampling elephants.  Rabbit attempts to get help for the problem, but rejects Frog's offer right from the start.  This frees up Frog to linger, watch the action, and laugh at the many failed attempts to roust The Long One.  Jackal, Leopard, Elephant, and Rhinoceros all have solutions, but these tend to consist of destroying Rabbit's home.  Finally, Frog returns with a clever ploy and scares The Long One (now shown to be merely a boastful caterpillar) out of the house.  Everyone has a good laugh, but none so heartily as Frog.<br /><br />The combination of Aardema's talented storytelling alongside the artwork of illustrator-gods Leo and Diane Dillon was a match made in heaven.  To this day I don't know why this book isn't better known.  It has all the elements of a great tale.  First of all, Aardema has (according to a small note on the publication page) \\"combined repetition of key phrases with authentic African ideophones to produce a rhythmic read-aloud text which preserves the essential flavor of an African tale\\".  Maybe so.  All I know is that there's a wonderful sense of rising and falling action in this tale.  Aardema is good at bringing the tension to a climax in which Frog reveals the villain to be nothing more than a tiny creature.  The Dillons, for their part, engage in a kind of artwork completely different from later books like \\"The People Could Fly\\" or even \\"Rap A Tap Tap\\".  The Masai characters are mere outlines, with beautifully detailed jewelry and faces that evoke a feeling of masks.  Their masks, on the other hand, are sometimes cartoonish but always eye-catching.  They express emotions in a fantastical way that no real mask could ever do.  As a result, Frog has this perpetually amused expression on her face while Rabbit looks put-out most of the time.<br /><br />If you want the logical companion to this book, you must seek out storyteller Luann Adams' \\"The Tricky Caterpillar and Other Tales\\" CD.  Adams brings the title tale, very similar to this one, to shocking and riveting life.  You could do far worse that to accompany your storytelling with a smattering of Adams' accomplished voice.  Also, if you find that your child readers are intrigued by Masai culture and wisdom, consider reading aloud to them some selectionsfrom the beautifully written, \\"Our Secret, Siri Aang\\" by Cristina Kessler.  All in all, these will bring \\"Who's In Rabbit's House\\" a little more background and a little more color.  This book stands beautifully on its own, I should note.  A must-have for any child's personal library.selections from the beautifully written, \\"Our Secret, Siri Aang\\" by Cristina Kessler.

59681:US	49148452	R304NFP6M4I6E0	0374435251	663003152	I, Juan de Pareja (Sunburst Book)	Books	3	14	25	N	N	Truth is beauty.  Beauty, truth.	How far we have come.  How much farther we have to go.  As with most Newbery award winning children's books published before the year 1990, I approached \\"I, Juan de Pareja\\" with mounting trepidation.  Originally published in 1965, the book is a fictionalized story of the real-life relationship between the great Spanish painter Diego Velazquez and his slave, Juan de Pareja.  Potential pitfalls abound in such a set-up.  The great danger of books like this one is that it can possibly trivialize the notion of slavery itself.  When you write a slave-master buddy book like this one, it's all too easy to make them appear like equals, glossing over the inherent horror of one man owning another.  As an author, Elizabeth Barton de Trevino does this quite a bit.  Juan's sole objection to slavery is the fact that it means he cannot legally paint.  We can suspect that the real Senor Pareja felt a tad differently.  Just the same, the book is a warm interesting historical novel that will educate a great many kids on painting, the great painters of the past, and Juan de Pareja's role.<br /><br />Born a slave and owned by the aunt of painter Diego Velazquez, Juan narrates the story of his life to us.  Dona Emilia teaches Juan to read and write, eventually dying and leaving him to her nephew after her death.  Traveling to Velazquez's home becomes an enormous ordeal, however, when Juan finds himself at the cruel mercy of a sadistic gypsy and is nearly killed in the move.  All the more reason he should appreciate his new master, a taciturn man of little words but great compassion.  Juan's duties become primarily based on stretching canvasses for his master, grinding paints, and setting up studio settings.  Over the years, the slave yearns to paint his own portraits, but is stopped by a Spanish law forbidding slaves from participating in the arts.  This does not stop our hero, however, and he proceeds to paint in secret for years on end.  Only when he confesses in a surprisingly public way does Juan receive far more than the mere permission to put paint to canvass.<br /><br />Trevino tells her story lightly and with great spirit.  Little adventures spring up on each and every page, keeping the action going with what appears to be little effort.  She is equally adept at almost all the characters' personalities as well.  Velazquez is aloof but compassionate and a man of few words.  His daughter Paquita is willful but has enough charm in her to get what she wants at all times.  Only Juan de Pareja seems a half-completed portrait.  He cries constantly, weeping at everything from the death of his first mistress to a viewing of Michelangelo's Pieta to receiving his own freedom.  When he says that \\"I have always been quick to tears\\", this is understatement at its finest.  You wonder if there is ever a time when he is not sobbing into his wine.  Other problems with Juan's character continue.  When he receives his freedom we are supposed to believe (as Trevino says in an Afterword at the end) that Pareja and Velazquez, \\"continued as companions in their maturity and ended as equals and as friends\\".  Equals where one calls the other \\"master\\" to the end of his days?  Trevino has made the awful mistake of having Pareja be so docile and undemanding that slavery is not a burden to him.  He's never mad at the institution, all the more maddening when you see his future wife begin her story by being angry at slavery and end as stupefied as her husband.  What on earth does Trevino gain if she creates a character who worships his enslaver long past the point of understanding?  I was also a little surprised by how little of this story concentrated on Velazquez's undoubtedly most famous portrait, \\"Las Meninas\\".  The picture appears for exactly two pages, and that is all.  A very odd choice on the author's part.<br /><br />None of this is to say that the book doesn't make for a good read.  It's simply very difficult to wholeheartedly love a book in which a slave acts more than a bit of an Uncle Tom for most of its pages.  Certainly Trevino does not condone slavery.  She just has a hard time understanding that if a white man frees a black man and the black man continues to cow-tow to the white man, that is not equality.  That is a slavery of the mind.  Had Velazquez once done something nice for Pareja post-freedom or even paid him for his past services, the book would be redeemed.  Instead, he makes a somewhat lame excuse about meaning to have freed Juan years ago (it just slipped his mind, silly man!) then feels a saint for having done it at all.  ARG!  The reason I even read this book is that I am leading a book group of six 8-12 year-olds and I needed to know the story.  I'm looking forward to hearing the kids' reactions to it.  Was it horrendously boring for them?  What did they like about it?  Would they recommend it to friends?  Whatever the case, \\"I, Juan de Pareja\\" has some interesting passages and a great story that is mired down by the ignorance of its author.  I would still recommend that kids read it, but I would be very careful to point out its flaws and stupidities to them as well.

Not so.  The much neglected and little appreciated early chapter book genre is too often filled up with garbage like \\"Dick and Jane\\" and \\"Care Bears\\" books.  It takes real skill and resolve to find titles for this reading level that are halfway decent, let alone urbane.  Enter the dizzying duo of Monika Bang-Campbell and Molly Bang.  With Bang-Campbell's clever asides flittering about the book and Bang's delicate watercolors perfectly complimenting the action, \\"Little Rat Rides\\" is probably the best early chapter book written within my lifetime.  I kid you not.<br /><br />Little Rat has a dream.  In her previous adventure, \\"Little Rat Sets Sail\\" it was to learn how to sail without giving into her fears.  Now her fears stem from an entirely different source.  Little Rat wants to learn how to ride a horse, just like her daddy once did.  Wanting something and getting it turn out to be two entirely different matters, however, when our heroine comes face-to-face with the gentle \\"mountain on four legs\\" Pee Wee.  Little Rat's newfound reluctance isn't helped by a malicious goat that sometimes gets in the horse's way, or the bumps, bruises, and accidents that befall our intrepid hero.  The fact that Little Rat sticks with riding becomes an impressive act, and by the end she and Pee Wee have deservedly won fifth prize in the big Fourth of July Horse Show.<br /><br />The story in and of itself doesn't sound like much, I'll grant you.  And if a lesser author and a lesser illustrator were working on it, I'd probably recommend it to horsey fans and leave it at that.  No, what's amazing here is what the author has done with the simplest of words.  Scenes that are humorous are also almost dry in their delivery.  When Pee Wee accidentally stands on Little Rat's foot, she tries to get him off by shoving him.  \\"But Pee Wee was a giant horse, and Little Rat was a little rat.  You do the math\\".  The book's full of small asides like this.  On top of the superb writing, there also lies a story about sticking with something even if it's hard.  Little Rat's first thoughts when meeting the humongous Pee Wee are somewhere along the lines of, \\"We have cars now.  Why learn to ride a horse?\\".  Children who are just beginning to join organized sports, take up instruments, or learn new hobbies will sympathize with the suddenly reluctant Rat.  Those that are taking riding lessons of their own may even remember thinking similar thoughts.<br /><br />Illustrator Molly Bang hardly needs introduction, but I'll give her one anyway.  From her almost Impressionistic, \\"When Sophie Gets Angry... Really Really Angry\\" to her subdued scientific \\"My Light\\" (a wonderful way to explain electricity and other forms of energy to kids), Ms. Bang is adept at a wide range of styles.  She knows how to wield paint and pencil equally well and I'd trust any book in her hands.  The \\"Little Rat\\" series is done with watercolors, pencil, gouache, and a smidgen of chalk dust.  Looking at the \\"photo\\" of Daddy Rat on his own Fourth of July horse, I couldn't help but wonder if \\"Photoshop\\" should be added to her list of talents as well, or if she's just good at doctoring photographs.  In this book, Bang has chosen to keep everything to scale.  Little Rat isn't a human sized creature leaping onto a stallion and riding off into the sunset.  She's rat-sized, and the horse is horse-sized.  You can well understand her reluctance to climb aboard when you see her tiny figure propped high up on her equine companion.  This is especially amusing at the horse show, where squirrels, rabbits, and raccoons also sit aloft large impressive bays.  Best of all, Bang has a real feel for emotion and expression.  Chrissy Goat's nasty horizontal pupils shine out with a clearly evil intent whereas Pee Wee's gentle demeanor is evident from the moment he first appears.<br /><br />For those kids just getting used to reading early chapter books on their own, there are few books out there better suited than the remarkable, \\"Little Rat Rides\\".  It's sweet-natured, has a darn good lesson at its core, and is stunning to the eye.  If we could get all the early chapter books out there to be half as good as this story, the world would be a better place.

The fun comes when you get to see who the villain is.  If the first book in the \\"Molly Moon\\" series was about Molly coming to terms with who she is, the second is Molly's newfound understanding of her past and her acceptance of it.  None of this is to say that the book isn't as much fun as the first.  Heck, Byng's pulling out all the stops with this one.  There are more freaky twists, surprising villains, and misleading touches in this book than you can shake a fist at.  The sequel in this case can certainly be said to be better than its predecessor.<br /><br />Molly's bitten off more than she can chew.  When she was contacted by the town's mysterious librarian Lucy Logan for a meeting, she never could have anticipated where such a thing would lead.  At the meeting, Molly learns of the existence of a supremely evil and supremely gifted hypnotist by the name of Primo Cell.  Owner of countless businesses and friend to hundreds of important Hollywood stars, Molly is sent to take Primo down.  Amongst his other crimes, he may be directly involved in the kidnapping of young child star (and former Molly Moon rival) Davinia Nuttel.  Problem is, Primo appears to be Molly's superior in every way.  He's a better hypnotist, he knows how to keep people from being un-hypnotized, AND he knows a trick that Molly's only just learned.... How to stop time itself.  It's going to take a lot of courage and a great deal of ingenuity for Molly, her best friend Rocky, and their dog Petula to keep from becoming Cell's next victims.<br /><br />Hypnotism takes a turn for the dark in this second part in Byng's ever-popular series.  Now the villains aren't all bumbling and cute like Mr. Nockman in \\"Molly Moon's Incredible Book of Hypnotism\\".  They're cold and unafraid to kill off kids to get their way.  Some truly horrible things are done to hypnotized people here, but nothing so bad that it makes for an inappropriate read.  Byng seems remarkably good at making people threatening without scaring the kid readers.  No mean trick.  The book has a slight problem with tempo, however.  Midway through the story the action begins to grind to a not-so-exciting halt, ending only when Molly and Rocky FINALLY get captured.<br /><br />If Molly's first book is ruled by the image of cuckoos, this book is ruled by constant references to magpies.  It's anyone's guess what the third book's avian will be (though I have my hopes that it'll be kookaburras).  If you've a kid who was entranced by Molly in her first adventure, have little fear that this second number is a doozy.  It's better than its predecessor and fun to boot.  I do have to wonder what British readers think about a English heroine who has all her fun adventures in America, and who distances herself more and more from the Motherland.  Ah well.  Such concerns are not your own.  This is a great book and a wonderful addition to any library.  It will, at the very least, keep you from boredom.

Oh, not because of her writing.  The increasingly popular \\"Molly Moon\\" book series is fun and all, but nobody's about to give it a National Book Award or anything.  No no, I'm talking about marketing.  Here's the question that I want to pose to you:  Why hasn't an author previous to Ms. Byng ever written a children's book where hypnotism was freaky, fabulous, and fun?  I'm sure there's a \\"Goosebumps\\" book out there somewhere that uses it, and perhaps some small titles from small publishers, but that's it.  Prior to the creation of Ms. Moon, the world was one big black hole for hypnotism luvvin' kiddies.  No more.  Published originally in England and republished here in the States (where Harper Collins was smart enough to give the \\"Molly Moon\\" books an extra shot of spin and sparkle cover-wise), Byng's hot stuff.  The kiddies clamor for her books.  They compare her Rowling and Snicket and Pilkey.  In truth, this first installment in the hip hypno series is lightweight fun and nothing more.  It hasn't the soul of a \\"Harry Potter\\" book, but it does have a great sense of humor and a heroine who for once (thankfully) starts homely and ends homely but happy.<br /><br />Molly Moon is an unattractive child.  She has legs that bear a striking resemblance to Spam, close set green eyes, a potato-like nose, and a voice so droning that the other kids call her \\"Drono\\".  All her life she's lived in the Hardwick Orphanage and felt that her physical traits were problems.  That all changes when she discovers a mysterious book of hypnotism in the town's library.  Suddenly Molly finds that her voice is perfect for vocal hypnotism and her eyes for visual.  With these newfound powers under her belt, Molly sets out to remake the cruel place she's always called home and to give herself a new life.  Before she knows it she's jetting off to America, living the high life at the Waldorf Hotel, and starring in her own Broadway musical.  What Molly doesn't know, however, is that someone else is looking for her book.  Someone who knows the secrets it contains.  Someone, who's followed her and knows how to get to her where it hurts.<br /><br />The book has everything.  A lonely, teased, unattractive orphan who has (basically) magical powers to get whatever she wants.  Cruel villains who fall under the kid's spell with little effort.  Jailbreaks, musical numbers, just desserts, and all the money you could ever want.  Byng isn't afraid to make her gross moments absolutely disgusting (I'm not going explain in detail, but I think the words \\"snot sandwich\\" sum them up pretty well) and her stand-up and cheer moments truly happy.  Better yet, she has the guts to make Molly pretty unlikable for a while.  At first the readers of this book cheer her on, knowing full well that she deserves revenge.  Then she goes too far.  The book's not bad at bringing Molly around to the real world and using her powers for good instead of evil.  It does get a little bit preachy and sunshiny at the end, though.  And kids are probably going to be a lot more forgiving of some of Ms. Moon's tricks than adults will.<br /><br />Are Molly's powers realistic?  Heck, no.  She goes from lowly victim status to being able to hypnotize people just by looking at them in a day.  Maybe two.  Still, how different is this than any book in which an orphan discovers that he or she is special in some way?  And the book really is enjoyable, once you get past Molly being a greedy-guts.  There's even a section on page 224 where the reader suddenly believes that everything they've learned is a lie.  This elevates the book from mediocre-fantasy-story to surprisingly-surprising-fantasy-story.  Plus, if any of you adults out there figure out how the kids are going to outwit the villain before they do then I'll eat my hat.<br /><br />In the end, I'm a \\"Molly Moon\\" fan.  So are hundreds of thousands of kids out there.  If you're looking for one of thehottest book series out there and you want something a little more fun than the usual fare, grab yourself a Byng.

It's beautiful to look at and has a sweet little story, that's for certain.  It's just difficult to write a review of something that's so quietly nice.<br /><br />Mama remembers Costa Rica.  To her, it is still home.  Though she and her daughter Ana live in a large city in the United States, Mama still dreams of someday returning to visit her family in South America.  Ana understands this dream.  Throughout the day she and her best friend Sophia have gone about their neighborhood learning about the hopes and wishes of their neighbors.  That night, Ana takes a stone her Mama brought with her from Costa Rica and dreams that she is a red-winged blackbird making her way to that distant land.  She visits with the family, sees how beautiful the land is, and then wakes up in the morning thinking, \\"I will wish for luck, work hard, and hold hope inside, till my dream comes true\\".<br /><br />See?  Quietly nice.  The story here is a perfect companion to any child of immigrant parents living in America and hoping to see distant relatives once again.  Russell offers a fairly mature vision of dreams and what happens to them when they are deferred.  Ana's Mama's boss is a [...] old man who scoffs at dreams and dreaming.  Ana is quick to see how this leaves him without hope or happiness, a fate she would like to avoid.  Claire B. Cotts' illustrations compliment the quiet dignity of the book perfectly.  Some picture, such as the shot of Ana lying on the bed with the stone in her hand, are gorgeous without ever becoming gaudy.  Colors are muted, but are bright in splotches, especially when Ana visits Costa Rica in her mind.<br /><br />The book brings to mind other mother/daughter urban picture book titles, like Vera B. Williams', \\"A Chair For My Mother\\".  For some families this book will become a beloved title, carried close to the heart for generations.  For others, it is a nice if not particularly memorable journey.  To my mind, \\"The Remembering Stone\\" fills a need and does so in a soft imaginative way.  Lovely and touching.dy.

Kids are pretty savvy when it comes to discovering books that fill a particular need.  At the library where I work, I'd seen them taking out this \\"Warriors\\" series by Erin Hunter fairly regularly.  For some reason it's near impossible to keep these puppies on the shelves.  Curiosity got ahold of me, so I decided to sit down and read through the first of these somewhat odd stories.  I would never have been able to guess that the secret lives of cats would be so interesting to children.  Housecats, definitely not.  But when it comes to the lives and loyalties of the feral variety, Hunter's definitely tapped into a rich resource of text.<br /><br />Rusty has a fairly good life.  He lives with a family of humans (or Two-legs) that love him.  He gets regular feedings, even if it's yucky dry stuff.  He even has his own little cat door to come in and out of.  Rusty isn't content, however.  He dreams of catching mice in the forest not far from his home.  When a night's exploration of that forest ends with a confrontation with the wild cats that live without human interference, Rusty readily joins them and their clan.  Renamed \\"Firepaw\\", the cat learns that he has dropped smack dab into the middle of a war.  The clan he has joined is called ThunderClan and is ruled by the magnanimous Bluestar.  Other clans like RiverClan, WindClan, and ShadowClan fight continually for dominance over a rapidly dwindling food supply.  ThunderClan needs recruits like Firepaw to stay alive, and through their training the new cat is on his way to becoming a warrior.  Along the way he must face hunger, dismissal, and learn some shocking truths about the animals he's agreed to join.<br /><br />Hunter conjures up a well-thought out world in which cats have their own system of governance.  This is a kind of \\"Watership Down\\", but with drawn out fighting sequences.  The cats here act like cats.  They don't put on vests and waistcoats and discuss philosophy.  They don't stand on their hind legs or use their paws like fingers.  These are real animals.  For the sake of keeping them alive, Hunter does create a kind of Medicine Cat for each clan, who rubs natural herbs into wounds.  That's about as technically adept as these kitties get.  At the beginning of the book, the author presents us with two maps of the area where this book takes place.  A cat-view map lists everything in their terms.  A second human-view map makes it clear where exactly the cats actually are.<br /><br />This is not to say that the book isn't downright silly at times.  Hunter loves giving these cats somewhat repetitive names like Nightpelt, Smallear, and Longtail.  One cat, Lionheart, has the same name as a carebear from the 1980s.  Poor planning on Hunter's part.  She also falls into a classic children's literature trap.  You know that when the main character has a vital piece of information that he should give someone as soon as possible and he says something along the lines of, \\"Oh good!  Now I can tell this person this vital piece of information\\", that something's going to come up to prevent him.  In this case, Firepaw is given to understand that a friend of his may be killed almost immediately.  So does he immediately go out and tell the clan's wise leader?  Heck no!  He's given TWO chances to do so and each time he keeps quiet for obscure plot-centric reasons.  That's really the kind of book that this is.  It's fun to read, exciting, and with a new meticulously thought out world.  It's also rather predictable.<br /><br />If you've a kid who's a fan of the \\"Redwall\\" series but is more interested in animals that don't wear clothing, this is the book for you.  Both boys and girls check it out at a fast and furious rate.  It's one of the few series out there that both sexes enjoy fully.  A better written book than all the \\"Magic Treehouse\\" and \\"Droon\\" series out there combined but still less good than, say, Avi's, \\"Poppy\\" books or \\"Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH\\".use their paws like fingers.

76917:US	49148452	R6LCXZ24QHQ2D	0670869392	946622842	There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Fly swallowers of the world, unite!	Ah, Hoosiers.  Is there anything they can't do?  The folk poem, \\"There Was An Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly\\" is probably the best known item found in the 1947 collection of \\"Hoosier Folklore\\".  It has been turned into a wide variety of picture books, ranging from straightforward translations to bizarre new takes.  If we were to pick the number one quintessential version of the poem in picture book form, though, then I guess the distinction would have to fall on Simms Taback's winner of the 1998 Caldecott Honor.  In this version, a crazed senior citizen terrifies a community with her singular palate.<br /><br />I think you probably know the song already, but it never hurts to sum it up.  As we all know, there was an old lady who swallowed a fly.  \\"I don't know why she swallowed the fly.  Perhaps she'll die\\".  To rid herself of the fly problem she eats a spider.  Then, having obviously not thought this through, she eats a bird to catch the spider who, in turn, is supposed to catch the fly.  I'd like to point out that when we get the occasional stomach-side view of the situation, nobody's doing any catching.  Obviously the old lady isn't explaining to each animal what its job's supposed to be as she throws them down the hatch.  By the time the old lady swallows a cat, she's pretty far gone.  Her bloodshot eyes (nobody does good bloodshot eyes like Mr. Taback) roll in her head as she lunges haphazardly throughout the countryside.  The cat is followed by a dog, the dog is followed by a cow.  Apparently cows are good dog-catchers.  Finally, she swallows a horse, and (best line in the song), \\"She died of course!\\".  The author offers a sly moral at the end that is hard to contest. \\"Moral: Never swallow a horse\\".  The book does not linger on the fate of the animals swallowed, which is probably for the best.<br /><br />What sets this version of the story apart from that of other books is the running commentary provided by the animals who have already been swallowed or are next on the list.  Using a collage of mixed media on Kraft paper, Taback creates a kooky colorful world where the cut-outs of real objects intermingle with drawings.  His old lady is deranged in all the right ways.  Her eyes never look in the same direction and she's just so comical (her dress's pattern apparently extends into her stomach), that instead of being disturbed by her death, the book just makes it seem sort of inevitable.  Besides, you can't act like it's a big surprise.  The recurring phrase is, \\"Perhaps she'll die\\".  I was particularly delighted with the steady stream of news articles about the old lady that pop up throughout the story.  The first article, \\"Old Lady Swallows Fly\\", appears in the highly reputable New York Times.  The second article, \\"Cat Attacked: Culprit Identified\\" is in the less reputable New York Post.  So by the time you get to the National Enquirer's, \\"Lady Wolfs Down Dog\\", you understand that the outlandishness of the tale is being reflected in the media as well.  I was a little sad that the story about the cow didn't appear in the Weekly World News.  Can't have everything, I suppose.<br /><br />If you've any familiarity with Taback's other works (like his lovely, \\"Joseph Had a Little Overcoat\\") then you know what to expect.  If you aren't familiar, then you're in for a treat.  Kids reading this book will like the already perfect rhymes but will also enjoy finding small details found in each and every picture.  Be sure to turn to the back cover of this book for Taback's useful guide to a variety of different flies.  There are 23 of them there, by my count, and they range from the Lauxanid Fly to the Mydas.<br /><br />It's fun to look at different versions of this same folksong.  I highly suggest that if you're looking for a wide range of elderly ladies consuming insect and mammal, try taking a glace at Glen Rounds', \\"I Know An Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly\\".  Also try taking a gander at the particularly original, \\"I Know A Shy Fellow Who Swallowed a Cello\\" by Barbara Garriel.  I'm just waiting for the day when some sly author/illustrator thinks to republish the entire book of \\"Hoosier Folklore\\" for the kiddies.  Until that happy day arrives, we can enjoy books like this one.  A true pleasure to read.A Shy Fellow Who Swallowed a Cello\\" by Barbara Garriel.

I knew it would happen sooner or later!  I knew it!  Given enough time, I was certain that if I simply continued to read books written by Polly Horvath that eventually I would hit upon one that I liked.  That's a pretty snarky statement to start off a review, especially if it's a review of a book that the self-same reviewer liked.  Still, I feel some background is in order.  I struggled mightily through, \\"Everything On a Waffle\\".  I visibly cringed with every word of \\"The Canning Season\\".  Having grown up in the same town as Ms. Horvath (long live Kalamazoo!) and attended the same church as her mother (fellow children's author Betty Horvath) I've always been rooting for her to write something that didn't take the enamel off of my teeth.  At long last, she's done it.  She's written a book that I think everyone can enjoy.  Even people, like myself, who would rather eat hot mustard raw than read yet another precious child raised by crazy aunts tale (in which she seems, usually, to be stuck).<br /><br />Of the Pepins, there are four.  A mother who works part time doing peanut butter experiments, a father who's a corrugation expert at a cardboard factory, a son who is a genius, and a daughter who has no particular talents of which to speak.  When we first meet them, the Pepins have toad problems.  More precisely, toad-in-shoe problems.  Here the author speaks directly to the readers of this book everywhere and asks them to send her their potential solutions to this abnormality mentally.  This is sort of the form of the novel, and depending on how useful the readers' advice is, the Pepins either exacerbate their problems or alleviate them.  As we follow them through a series of fun and funny occurrences (such as having a dapper man suddenly appear in their midst or when they deal with the fact that their very fine neighbor is in love with a barbershop pole) the reader has the chance to find a solution to various Pepin-related problems.  Sometimes the answers are ridiculously easy (as when the family becomes trapped on their own roof) and sometimes impossible to solve (as when the cow produces lemonade rather than milk).  Through it all, however, Horvath's uniquely skewed point of view enlivens a truly bizarre tale that'll have your kids screaming for a third, fourth, and possibly fifth read.<br /><br />Initially, the book's rather like a slightly older extension of James Marshall's classic \\"The Stupids\\" series (complete with cat and dog, no less).  As you continue to read it through, however, it grows on you. It's almost a stream of consciousness.  A child-friendly \\"Ulysees\\", if you will.  I would like to concede here and now that it is entirely possible that I'm giving this book a lot of slack because it referenced the musical \\"Pippin\\" obliquely.  I'm a sucker for any book that knows its Fosse.<br /><br />Through it all, Horvath throws out phrases like \\"dei ex machina\\" and makes references that will sail over children's heads only to be gratefully snatched up by their parents.  And it's funny.  Very very funny.  When Mr. Pepin attempts to speak like an Englishman the book notes that, \\"The only two Englishmen that Mr. Pepin knew were Sherlock Holmes and Henry Higgins.  He was doing his best to become an amalgamation of the two\\".  If you do not find that at least mildly amusing then this is not the book for you.<br /><br />To come right out and say it, I think  I liked \\"The Pepins and Their Problems\\" because unlike Horvath's other works it didn't have her usual undercurrent of nastiness running beneath the action.  There's only one truly nasty character in this book (a character that could creep into \\"The Canning Season\\" and not create so much as a ripple) and she only lasts for about 2 chapters.  The only people who will fail to find this book amusing may be those Delaware and Rhode Island natives who could take offense at some of the pot-shots lobbied at them within this book.  If those natives are so thin-skinned, however, then perhaps they didn't deserve to read the book in the first place.  To my mind, this is Horvath's greatest creation.  I highly recommend that you check out the audio version for car trips, by the way.  There's a lot of room here for sly asides and pregnant pauses.  Altogether, a joy to read, hear, or contemplate while on one's own roof.ever, then perhaps they didn't deserve to read the book in the first place.  To my mind, this is Horvath's greatest creation.

Slowly but surely, book by book, title by title, author Karen Beaumont is making a name for herself.  She started out slowly with amusing titles like \\"Duck Duck Goose (A Coyote's On the Loose)\\" and the justifiably forgotten \\"Being Friends\\".  Then, recently, she's been picking up speed.  Producing books that, with the right illustrators, bring fully to life her bouncy trouncy rhythms.  Beaumont isn't afraid of a little rhyme and rhythm.  By the time I got around to reading \\"Baby Danced the Polka\\" I found that I'd been missing one of the hottest rhyming children's writers alive today.  We can only hope that this inventive streak she's showing is the real thing and not a momentary fluke.<br /><br />In \\"Baby Danced the Polka\\" you've got a lot of kid-friendly elements all jouncing around together.  This book shimmies and shakes, is about a kid who doesn't want to take a nap (something so many little ones can identify with), has a beat to it, and falls into the category of lift-the-flap books.  The story takes place on a sleepy farm where a mother and father have chores to do, so they put their little baby to sleep.  Just the same, the baby in question isn't about to settle down for the afternoon.  It proceeds to dance the polka, the boogie-woogie, the cha-cha, and the shooby-dooby with a whole host of stuffed animals.  Though its parents keep insisting it go to bed, this babe can't help but put on its dancing shoes.  By the end, he's convinced both Mama and Pa, so all three members of the family dance until it's night.  Then, at long last, the baby goes to bed, \\"With dreams of polka parties / Still a-dancing in his head\\".<br /><br />I reviewed a children's book of poetry not long ago where other reviewers complained that the poems didn't scan correctly.  No such problem exists here.  Beaumont has a golden ear for fun and funny preschool comedy.  Kids will have a hard time resisting an infant who wants to strut and shimmy while all the time clothed in jammies.  Also, the book isn't afraid to slide into silliness on occasion.  At one point the \\"chores\\" performed by the parents include, \\"... Papa shaved his whiskers / And Mama washed her wig\\".  Washed her wig?<br /><br />Illustrator Jennifer Plecas (who I already loved due to her \\"Good Night, Good Knight\\") is in fine form here as well.  This baby has moves.  Admittedly, the polka doesn't look much like a polka and the cha-cha could use some work.  It would've been nice to see actual honest-to-goodness dance moves within this book's pages.  Ah well.<br /><br />For a storytime of true dance fever you might want to consider pairing this rhythmic coup with other bouncy farm tales like, \\"Dumpy La Rue\\" by Elizabeth Winthrop or \\"Barn Dance!\\" by Bill Martin.  For its own part, \\"Baby Danced the Polka\\" is going to be deeply loved by scores and scores of children everywhere.

On the coolness scale, kids rank George Washington just above Chester B. Arthur and just below... oh, I dunno... pickled yams.  Which is to say, GW's PR department needs some help.  Enter the National Geographic publishing company.  Continually churning out fine fine non-fiction titles for kiddies everywhere, the good folks at the National, with the help of author Thomas B. Allen, have done their darndest to make Mr. Washington less the kind of guy you're supposed to remove your hat in memory of, and more the kind of guy who'd give James Bond a run for his money when it comes to espionage.  Sporting a cover on which George smirks slyly from beneath a dark and shadowy cape collar, the book makes the claim that the only reason we really won the Revolutionary War was because our first president was a whiz at spying.  It's an intriguing premise and an amusing little book.<br /><br />Let's say you're an up-and-coming young republic.  You've been ruled by a distant country over the sea for quite some time but recently that rule's been chafing you.  What is the answer then?  Well, if you happen to be America the answer is open rebellion (if you happen to be Northern Ireland, good luck to you).  As George Washington came of age in America, he learned how important a good intelligence network was in a time of war.  Having served in the French and Indian War, George saw good spying done firsthand.  When America next attempted to pull away from the British, Mr. Washington was able to put this theory into practice.  Chronicling the course of the war and the significant changes wrought due to both American and British intelligence, Allen gives fresh insights into everything from Paul Revere's Ride to the heroism of Lafayette.  Kids reading this book will learn how to create invisible ink, hide a message within a message, and codify their writing.  There's even a complete word for word Tallmadge code at the back of the book for future use, and the book hides hidden messages on selected pages for translation.<br /><br />So how readable is \\"George Washington, Spymaster\\"?  Well, it has its moments, that's for sure.  Allen is at his best when the action is at its peak.  The sections describing Benedict Arnold's betrayal are fairly riveting as are the parts of the book that talk about double agents.  One of the problems with the story, however, is the number of characters that randomly pop up in it.  Keeping one spy apart from another is a hazardous undertaking.  Allen provides the reader with a makeshift spy chart at the beginning of the book, but if you're able to refer to it then you're a better man than I, Gunga Din.  I did enjoy seeing how many women and African-Americans aided the spy cause.  What struck me as a little odd, however, was the fact that the blacks helped out the Revolutionaries at all.  I mean, slavery was illegal in England and legal in America.  Wouldn't the African-Americans have wanted to align themselves with a nation that disapproved of such a barbaric practice?  Allen leaves such questions unaddressed and unanswered.<br /><br />If you've a kid who has enjoyed the tricky techniques and clever underground networking of this title, then may I suggest the similarly tricky if fictional, \\"The Year of the Hangman\\" by Gary Blackwood.  That book offers the what-if premise of \\"What if the British DIDN'T lose the Revolutionary War?\\" and utilizes all the spy techniques mentioned in \\"George Washington, Spymaster\\".  The two books tackle the same subject from different angles and end up complimenting one another nicely.  Not every kid is going to glom onto the notion that Washington was as cool a spy as 007 or whatever spy cartoon is currently all the rage.  Still, this is one biography that's just a bit less fuddy-duddyish than its contemporaries.  If I have a kid come into my library moaning that they need to read a bio on a Revolutionary War figure, this will be the first book I pluck from the shelves.  A great addition to any collection.on to any collection. <br />	2005-09-01

It's as if the man was some kind of a bottomless source of material, long after his folksinging days.  I guess this makes sense.  Friend and fellow activist Pete Seeger is responsible for some of the best picture books out there today, so why not take Guthrie's already family friendly child song fare and make it palatable to the children of the 21st century?  It's probably just a matter of time before Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, and Joni Mitchell do the same.  But until Ani DiFranco starts getting in on the act, let's examine one of Guthrie's lesser-known songs.  It's a fun little conceit but also a harmless little bit of fluff that won't stick in your brain much longer than a reading or two.<br /><br />Where do babies come from?  Well, sir, that's a mighty fine question.  If it were asked in seriousness we'd have to go pull out a copy of \\"Where Willy Went\\" by Nicholas Allan.  Fortunately, it is not and we instead watch a floppy-hatted guitar-strumming kid rhapsodizing on the subject.  \\"The flowers bring some, the trees bring some, the birds bring some, the cars bring some...\\".  One of the most amusing ways they might come, however, is via a kind of new baby train.  In his mind, the narrator sees himself catching such a train and finding it filled with babies ready to go to new homes.  When the conductor tells the boy to hop on board, he meets the infants already there and enjoys the ride.  The boy and babies sing together, partake of some especially tasty bottles, and nap a little while.  By the end, every baby has found its place, including one that's just come home with the boy.<br /><br />I have to say, illustrator Marla Frazee knows how to pick 'em.  I imagine she felt she'd hit gold when she found herself paired with an author like the inimitable Guthrie.  Talk about illustrating the words of giants!  Frazee's an impressive name in the children's literary world in her own right, I should note.  Her \\"Roller Coaster\\" is repeatedly requested by tots and her \\"Hush Little Baby: A Folk Song With Pictures\\" proves that she was already well-acquainted with both folksongs and the Dust Bowl long before \\"New Baby Train\\" landed in her lap.  The book itself invokes the dirt and hard labor of the Great Depression.  Pullman Porters, dusty farmlands, and babies reading the Hobo News (the word \\"STRIKE\\" is nice and bright on the front page) are all present here.  There are plenty of in-jokes for parents familiar in any way with Guthrie's life and works and the babies are beautifully multicultural, so that's one less thing to worry about.  Frazee's so careful that she even makes the undersides of the babies bare feet dark with the dirt of the road.  Of course, while there's nothing wrong with the book per say, it is a little confusing.  First the boy seems to be pretending that he's on the baby train.  Next thing you know you're at the end of the book and there's an honest-to-goodness baby there with him.  Still, I have a hard time resisting this work.  I mean, kids who read this story multiple times will discover that each baby is easy to spot and follow the story of.  It's nice that the one that goes home with the boy is also the only one that sang along with his guitar.<br /><br />I guess this book is just a matter of taste.  Some people will love it and some will scratch their heads trying to figure out what to make of it.  I do think that it's a bit confusing at times and I certainly wouldn't check it out when a child asks about the origin of babies in all seriousness.  It also would've been nice if the book had included a recording of the original song.  This would clear up the confusion surrounding the fact that this book never attempts to rhyme.  Bear that in mind if reading it aloud.  Try pairing this book instead with other baby friendly titles like \\"Baby Brains\\" by Simon James or \\"The Day the Babies Crawled Away\\" by Peggy Rathmann.  As it stands, I don't believe that this is the best Woody Guthrie book turned into picture book form, but it certainly stands on its own two feet just fine., I don't believe that this is the best Woody Guthrie book turned into picture book form, but it certainly stands on its own two feet just fine. <br />	2005-08-31
83083:US	49148452	R2WI1HP1EZSWI0	0786818603	990781467	The Golem's Eye (The Bartimaeus Trilogy, Book 2)	Books	5	5	5	N	N	I dream of Bartimaeus	Bartimaeus is back, baby!  After reading the first book in Jonathan Stroud's wittily penned \\"Bartimaeus Trilogy\\" I found I was referring to its author in conversation as the man who perfected the art of the fantasy footnote long before \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" sought to do the same.  Years passed before this sequel hit the market and in the interim I found I'd forgotten how much I enjoyed Stroud's originality and (dare I say?) morality.  Here we have an author unafraid to write a children/young adult fantasy novel with a morally ambiguous hero.  That was my take after the first book.  On picking up \\"The Golem's Eye\\", however, I found that Stroud has upped the ante.  Now our hero isn't just a vainglorious peacock.  He's a vainglorious peacock who's rapidly losing his soul to greed.  And when the demon you've captured to do your bidding becomes your conscience... well let's just say you've got a truly twisted Pinocchio tale on your hands.<br /><br />Nathaniel has problems.  He's only fourteen-years-old and already he's been promoted to an official post in the British magician-ruled government.  This isn't Nathaniel's problem, though.  Sure, it isn't easy trying to crush a pesky Resistance within the nation's capital.  That's Nathaniel's official job at the moment and he's having a devil of a time.  When something large, malicious, and destructive starts methodically tearing to shreds all the major tourism centers in town, the boy finds himself saddled with the task of figuring out what the creature is and how to stop it.  It is time, therefore, to call once again on his old djinni pal, Bartimaeus.  The demon is, suffice it to say, less than happy to see the boy again but after the two come to an agreement they discover that the source of the destruction is a golem of immense power.  Juggling Nathaniel's story with that of the Resistance member, Kitty, Stroud tells a tale of a truly believable world in which magic is available only at the expense of subjugated demons, djinni, afrits, and more.<br /><br />The notion of a dislikable (perhaps even evil) male protagonist is hardly new.  Where would the \\"Artemis Fowl\\" books be without their malignant boy leader?  Nathaniel's a little different, however.  Unlike Colfer's stories (which almost fear to become more complex than an episode of \\"Digimon\\") Stroud isn't afraid to create a fully three-dimensional character in Nathaniel.  This is a boy who spent a rough childhood under the stifling tutelage of a cowardly, pompous man.  An intelligent kid who's so wrapped up in the notion of power and prestige that he hardly notices his soul slipping further and further away from him.  If this book had been all about Nathaniel (like its predecessor) it would make for sickening reading.  That's why Stroud has chosen to break away from the continual Nathaniel/Bartimaeus narration and add a third voice to the mix.  The creation of Kitty, the girl who dreams of a society not run by magical cads, is wonderful.  Initially she's not much of a read.  You keep wishing there was a lot less of Kitty and a whole lot more of Bartimaeus.  He is, after all, the main draw here.  As the book continues, however, it becomes clear that Kitty is the book's moral core.  Nathaniel may yet be salvageable, but if he is it'll be due to Kitty's salvaging.<br /><br />It isn't just Kitty that provides us with the series' point, however.  Stroud himself isn't above taking veiled shots against real British society under the guise of this fantastical one.  One of my favorite footnote moments rendered by the snarky Bartimaeus comes when the demon is discussing the British Museum.  It's hard to remember that he's talking about a fictional one when pontificating that, \\"Most of these items made their eventual way to the ever-expanding collections of the British Museum, where they were set out on display with clear labels in  many languages so that foreign tourists could come and see their lost valuables with minimum inconvenience\\".<br /><br />One of the complaints I've heard lobbied against this book is that there isn't enough Bartimaeus.  I sympathize with this point of view.  The djinni is akin to slaves like Pseudolous in \\"A Funny Thing Happened On the Way to the Forum\\" or other Greek plays.  He's witty and urbane, constantly lobbing clever wordplays against his perpetually dense or stymied master.  It's important to remember, however, that a book written entirely in Bartimaeus' voice would grow pretty old pretty fast.  Better to contrast him with the earnestness of Kitty and the self-interested greed of Nathaniel.  Gives him a bit more of an edge, eh?<br /><br />The more I read of this book, the more I wanted to read.  I wanted to stay up all night devouring this tale.  Savoring Stroud's intelligence.  I was, admittedly, disappointed in his choice of I'm-not-even-gonna-bother-making-the-villain-hard-to-discover bad guy.  But I take heart in the idea that perhaps the third book in the \\"trilogy\\" (I put the word in quotes in the hope that Stroud thinks better of limiting this series to a measly three books) will give us some hard-core librarianship. In any case, this is an excellent addition to a series that grows increasingly complex with every twist and turn.

I'll assume not.  Every year the system revamps those picture books that it feels are necessary additions to your three-year-old's literary canon.  Most of these make a lot of sense.  Books like \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\", \\"Goodnight Moon\\", and \\"Click Clack Moo\\" are American staples.  Then you get to some of the more questionable choices.  I've little doubt that I would never have discovered \\"Spots, Feathers, and Curly Tails\\", had it not appeared on this list.  I'll mention that the idea that this is a book every child \\"should\\" know is questionable at best.  Still, it's a nice and very basic book covering farm animal body parts in a straightforward manner.  Your small children will have a hard time resisting the clear pictures, matter-of-fact writing, and baby animals.  Your large adults may feel the same way.<br /><br />The book is formatted so that on the left-hand page we receive a question.  The first one in the book is, \\"What has spots?\\".  Because this is an open-ended question (the answer could be anything from Dalmatians to kids with measles) there's a section of a farm animal artfully displayed on the opposing page.  Turn the page and there stands the whole animal with an explanation like, \\"A cow has spots\\".  Pretty straightforward.  In this manner kids learn that chickens have feathers, pigs have curly tails, a horse has a mane, a duck has a bill, a bull has horns, and that all these animals live on a farm in the country.  Author/illustrator Nancy Tafuri has chosen to depict each and every one of these animals in very clear watercolors and black pen outlines.  Each animal is realistic enough to be recognized by small children in real life.  The final shot of all these animals on a farm in the country is an idyllic verdant pastureland that perfectly sums up the entire enterprise.<br /><br />To my mind, this is a good introduction to farm animals.  Be sure to pair it with a couple Old MacDonald renditions (this book doesn't cover animal sounds, just appearances).  Then, if you're feeling ambitious, compliment it with the essential, \\"Click, Clack, Moo\\" by Doreen Cronin for a full farmland storytime.  This is a good toddler book that covers the bases but doesn't offer anything better or worse than the other barnyard fare out there.  Definitely check it out if it interests you but don't knock yourself out finding a copy.n to farm animals.

95208:US	49148452	R2BCW3PZMG9Y7Q	0064404455	547529228	Tom's Midnight Garden	Books	4	80	80	N	N	The thirteenth hour	Do you remember those old textbooks they used to hand out in fourth grade English class back in the 1980s?  How they'd contain a section or a snippet out of some of the great works of children's fiction in the hopes of whetting our elementary appetites and interests so that we'd seek out the books on our own?  No?  Well, I do.  I remember reading one of these textbooks one day and coming across a section in which a boy lives in a house where the clock strikes thirteen one night.  Then he stumbles onto a magnificent eerie garden that only appears at this time.  For years I carried the images from this single slight little passage with me, not knowing where they came from.  It was only when I became a children's librarian that I decided to rediscover my mystery book.  It didn't take long either.  \\"Tom's Midnight Garden\\" is a true literary classic.  Combining a British love of gardens with a bit of ghostly hauntings, time travel, and magical hours that don't exist in the regular world, the book has remained a classic, even if it has slipped out of the public eye a jot.<br /><br />Tom and Peter are uncommonly close brothers.  For them, summer is the time when they can play endless games in their backyard for hours at a time.  Imagine Tom's sorrow then when Peter comes down with the measles right at the beginning of the warm months AND Tom has been quarantined to his stuffy old aunt and uncle's home.  The boy is, needless to say, less than delighted with this chain of events.  His relatives occupy the second floor flat in an old building that is separated into apartments.  To top it all off, Tom has insomnia every night and finds himself wandering the building.  One night the grandfather clock on the first floor starts chiming an unheard of thirteen chimes.  Drawn by this peculiar number, Tom goes to the first floor, opens the back door, and finds himself facing a beautiful gigantic garden and woodsy area.  This is especially odd when you consider that during the day this place is a paved over alleyway replete with garbage cans and a high fence.  At night, however, it transforms into a magnificent wonderland for Tom and the girl he meets there, Hatty.  Hatty and Tom become inseparable, in spite of their mutual confusion over what exactly is going on.  Only when Tom is threatened with having to leave his aunt and uncle's (and thereby the garden) does he discover the source of the magic and the modern-day tie that pulls him there.<br /><br />Comparisons of this book to \\"The Children of Green Knowe\\" make perfect sense.  As I read this title, it didn't take much urging to be reminded of that other great fantasy in which a boy makes friends with otherworldly children.  \\"The Secret Garden\\" also pops into the brain, due to its eerie ghostlike wailings and magnificent hidden garden.  \\"Tom's Midnight Garden\\" is a little more methodical and (dare I say?) modern than these other books, though.  Though Tom and Hatty don't initially question why a garden mysteriously appears in his backyard every night, eventually Tom must solve the mystery with a little detective work of his own.  It's to the author's credit that by the tale's end, everything has been explained in a believable way.  Some fantasy authors are far too willing to show something spectacular and then explain it away with the lame excuse of \\"it's magic!\\".  Philippa Pearce is no such hack.  This is a well-thought through book that justifies its fantasy and still remains fun.<br /><br />I can't help but wish that reissues of \\"Tom's Midnight Garden\\" might consider giving it a bit of an updated cover.  The original illustrations by Susan Einzig are inoffensive enough, but wouldn't this book benefit from lush full-page color illustrations from someone like Tasha Tudor, Tony DiTerlizzi, or (as long as I'm indulging myself in pure fantasy) Dave McKean?  Slap a post-1958 cover on this puppy (possibly showing Tom getting his head stuck midway through the shed door) and you've got yourself a book that kids would be dying to get their hands on.  Instead, you've a title that savvy adult, parents, librarians, and schoolteachers will have to coyly promote.  Once the right kind of kid discovers it, however, you'll have a dickens of a time prying it from their hands.

I'm a children's librarian at a moderately sized branch in Greenwich Village, New York City.  I have a library assistant currently going to library school.  Between the two of us, we're fairly good at covering almost all the topics and age group titles required of us.  There is one notable exception to this, however.  Poetry.  Neither of us are particularly interested in it.  By extension, neither of us know much about it.  So when I set out to review all the great Caldecott Honor winners out there, I knew I'd be covering a lot of poetry gaps in my general children's knowledge.  Living in New York, Walter Dean Myers', \\"Harlem\\" is an especially good book to know about.  I live in Harlem.  I have kids coming in needing books on different New York communities all the time.  You'd think, therefore, that \\"Harlem\\" would be a kind of godsend.  Unfortunately, it's Walter Dean Myers at his most sophisticated.  Because of the adult nature of the poems, references, and illustrations in this book, I'm afraid I just can't recommend it to the swarming hoards of five to nine-year-olds that need picture books about the uptown area.  For them, I'll be handing over Brian Collier's, \\"Uptown\\".  For teens needing some Harlem beauty, \\"Harlem\\" is for them.<br /><br />The book can be read as a bunch of little poems all talking about the history, magnificence, and glory of Harlem.  It can also be read as a single continuing story that starts with a Great Migration from all over the world and ends on Dr. Martin Luther King Boulevard.  We see people up and people down.  We meet and view famous characters from history.  We see Harlem residents' faith, their religion, and their everyday activities.  Checkers players are viewed alongside pallbearers.  Kids and hot asphalt and lines like, \\"A journey on the A train / That started on the banks of the Niger / And has not ended\\".  The book is a celebration of a place by a man who was born and raised there, but does not live there today.  Something to chew on, I suppose.<br /><br />Kids will not get this book.  Not all kids.  A few will understand what it's saying, and a few who have it explained to them by talented teachers, will get it as well.  By and large, however, this is a book meant for teens and adults.  The kinds of people who might have read \\"Harlem Stomp\\" by Laban Carrick Hill and (as a result) now understand exactly what this book is referring to.  You need a little background and history in Harlem to understand \\"Harlem\\".  Myers is assuming that the casual reader is familiar enough with its past to nod sagely at such lines as, \\"A huddle of horns and a tinkle of glass, a note / Handed down from Marcus to Malcolm to a brother / Too bad and too cool to give his name\\".  And while I appreciate Myers' assumption that I'm that intelligent, I can't help but wonder why this book is considered children's.  Just because it has bright pretty pictures?  Puh-leeze.<br /><br />Not that the pictures are bad.  They're nice, in a cut paper/artistic kinda way.  But children won't gravitate towards them.  They're far more likely to prefer Collier's candybar cutouts on the already mentioned \\"Uptown\\".  Still, there's no denying the mastery behind these images.  \\"Harlem\\" may garner some complaints but few will be centered on the art.<br /><br />All in all, this is a perfectly nice book in search of an audience.

96819:US	49148452	RY3933I9MTA64	006050238X	755438255	On Your Toes: A Ballet ABC	Books	4	5	5	N	N	An ensemble piece	I think that I first fell in love with artist/illustrator Rachel Isadora when I read her 1970 masterpiece, \\"Ben's Trumpet\\".  That was the book, above all others, that will forever be associated with Ms. Isadora's great name.  That isn't to say that she isn't capable of other good books as well.  Fast forward some 30 years later and she's still cranking them out.  Of these some are more memorable than others.  One of the best, however, is a ballet-centric little alphabetical entitled, \\"On Your Toes\\".  A niggling little voice on my right shoulder wonders if there wasn't a more alphabetical way of naming the book, but that's splitting hairs to say the least.  What we have here is a fine fine title for those boys and girls for whom the glory of ballet is at its peak.<br /><br />Alphabet books all follow the same structure.  The words must conform to the theme, be it dinos, racecars, found objects, or secret agents (I kid you not).  In this case, Isadora has given everything a balletic nature.  She alternates French terms (like A - Arabesque and P - Pas de Chat) with clothing (M - Makeup, Z - Zipper) and characters from different shows (O - Odette, F - Firebird).  In doing this, the author makes it clear that she is well aware of the ins and outs of the child/ballet world.  Y stands for Yarn and shows a girl still in tights knitting something, legs splayed out before her.  It's a sight you'll see in every ballet company around the globe, but an image that few authors would have been canny enough to include.  It lends a bit of legitimacy to the entire book.  Likewise X is said to stand for \\"X marks the spot\\".  You see a girl playing Clara in \\"The Nutcracker\\" stepping delicately on an X that has been placed on the stage floor.  Again, if you know your theater then you know that such Xs are there to give actors and dancers an understanding of where to go in a scene.<br /><br />What I liked best about the book was that it seems genuinely like something kids would like.  Those kids already into ballet, that is.  The French terms (I well remember the flashcards of them I had to memorize when I was a wee ballerina tyke) may help some kids to remember what a grand jete or a developpe looks like.  Some might quibble that for some of the kids that need this book, the fact that it's an alphabet title disqualifies it from being desired by older kids.  I disagree, partly because it's a beautiful book and partly because I've rarely seen a kid turn down an alphabetic title when it was something that truly interested them.<br /><br />In the end, \\"On Your Toes\\" is smarter than the average ballet picture book and better looking than your average alphabet book.  It's multicultural, multi-gendered, and clever.  There's a beautiful glossary in the back that kids will benefit from and parents and adults will appreciate.  It's hard to find anything wrong with this book.  The best of its kind.Those kids already into ballet, that is.

As a kid, I always avoided horse books.  They were the kinds of titles plucked up by fellow girls for the purpose of indulging their pony-laden fantasies.  I never read \\"The Black Stallion\\" or \\"Black Beauty\\" or any of the classic equine titles out there.  I read \\"Equus\\", but I don't think that counts.  Then I decided to read all the Newbery award winning books I could get my hands on.  That meant getting my hands on a copy of \\"King of the Wind\\".  Fortunately, I've found that the older I get the more prejudices acquired during my youth are sloughed off with every book I read.  With \\"King of the Wind\\" you get a thrilling one-horse history based on a true story.  Though not the most satisfying of children's novels, kids reading the book will find themselves rooting steadfastly for this, the original underdog.<br /><br />Quiz Question of the Day: Where in early 18th-century were some of the finest horses in the world raised and bred?  If you answered Morocco then you are correct.  At the time of this story, a mute stableboy by the name of Agba witnesses the birth of a most unusual foal.  Born with a white spot on his foot (a good sign) and a wheat ear (a bad), the horse is named Sham by the boy and under the child's care grows healthy and strong.  The horse is so impressive that it is only one of six sent as a gift (with horseboy Agba in tow) to the King of France himself.  Unfortunately, this marks the true beginning of Sham's troubles.  A malicious sea captain starves the animals and they end up looking very poor gifts indeed.  Sham becomes an unruly workhorse.  Then he's separated from his boy and given to an uncommonly cruel man.  Boy and horse are reunited (and a cat comes along as well) only to pass from a kindly Quaker to a thoughless innkeeper.  Our heroes together weather jail, banishment, and all sorts of ills until Sham's talent is finally discovered at long last... sort of.  Though Sham never runs a great race (as any normal horse book would have him do) he sires some mighty-fine offspring who win all the races they're entered into.  Happy ending for all.<br /><br />Well, maybe \\"happy ending for all\\" is a bit much.  The book's focus, should anyone forget it, is not supposed to be the Muslim boy, Agba.  Author Marguerite Henry's choice of making him mute isn't too surprising when you think about it.  After all, the fact that no matter what country he ends up in he manages to understand the language is shaky ground at best.  If he can't talk then he can't suddenly burst into fluent French when the moment calls for it.  Also, he can't get out of tricky situations (like his unfair jail time) and is a perpetual victim as a result.  What struck me as particularly odd, however, was the end of the book.  Agba's fate is reduced to a single sentence.  After Sham's death Agba goes back to Morocco.  End of story.  Guess we know who the real hero in this tale is, huh?  This is especially frustrating when you consider that you've been rooting for this kid for roughly 173 pages.  To just drop him at the end without further to-do is harsh, to say the least.  I mean, we're talking about one of the first Muslim heroes in children's literature.  Surely that counts for something?  Consider, after all, that this kid is banished from a beautiful home at one point and forced to practically starve in a cold scary fen at another.  Then, at the end, the horse's newest owner tells the boy that all is forgiven and no hard feelings for making you live like a common thief, eh?  Why the boy doesn't end up just the tiniest bit bitter is beyond me.  I wonder if a kid of European blood would've been treated in a similar manner?  Methinks, not so much.<br /><br />And while I'm thinking about it, the ending's a little odd as well.  That, however, I'm a bit more lenient with.  Since this is based on a true story, Henry was limited in what she could or could not embellish.  Most books in which a racehorse is ignored for his true talents end with that horse winning a big race at the tale's end.  Not so here.  Sham never wins a single race (aside from unofficial ones in Morocco).  Instead, he simply sires more and more fast horsies, thereby \\"winning\\" by indulging in a most natural horse-like activity.  Still, if that's what actually happened then who am I to complain?<br /><br />I enjoyed this book thoroughly (in spite of my petty snipes).  Henry knows how to write a gripping tale, full of soaring highs and truly awful lows.  If you've a child with an affinity with horses, make sure that they won't feel too out of sorts when they see Sham beaten continually and abused in consistently awful ways.  Animal cruelty aside, \\"King of the Wind\\" is one of those Newbery winners that kids (if they skip the Prologue chapter) will get into immediately.

Both artists use remarkably original cut-outish designs to present stories of highly creative animals.  Both have also used mice in a great many of their books.  I was under the impression however that I'd never read a Walsh story, until I remembered her delightful \\"Mouse Paint\\" from a couple years ago.  In that story, Walsh used otherwise unemotional rodentia to tell a clever tale of camouflage and colors.  \\"Hop Jump\\" is not particularly dissimilar from \\"Mouse Paint\\" at first glance.  The characters never show much in the way of emotion.  Just the same, Walsh has a way of positioning her characters bodies and phrasing their thoughts so as to make you think that their otherwise blank faces express a wide range of intentions and meanings.  The result is a delightful little tale of frogs, dancing, and diversity.<br /><br />Betsy is bored to death with her compatriots.  No matter where they go, the other frogs go \\"Hop jump, hop jump\\".  They never change their style.  When she watches the pattern of falling leaves she attempts to imitate their movements.  Betsy cannot float gently to the ground, but she can leap, turn, twist, and dance.  Of course, the other frogs crowd her and inform her that there is no room for dancing.  When she goes off to find her own dancing ground, her fellows are intrigued and eventually join her.  The moment of truth comes when one other frog wants to hop and jump in the newly formed dancing circle.  The others try to tell him that there is no room for hopping.  Betsy contradicts them, however, and says, \\"Oh yes, there's room.  For dancing and for hopping\\".<br /><br />Walsh creates a variety of frogs that look similar at first but carry distinguishing characteristics.  Some have yellow spotted green bodies with green spotted yellow arms.  Others have purple spotted green bodies with yellow spotted green arms.  Betsy, so that the reader can tell her apart from the others, is the sole blue frog amongst them.  They all have benign expressions and wide orange eyes, though.  Using a minimal amount of arms and legs and bodies, Walsh coaxes a great deal of expressive movements out of these otherwise limited figures.  The message the story contains is a simple one and the pictures are just as easy to understand.  The words are also particularly short and good for those kids attempting to read their first picture book on their own.<br /><br />Cut-out picture books normally conjure images of Eric Carle.  I wish, rather, that images of Ellen Stoll Walsh were conjured instead.  \\"Hop Jump\\" is just one more well-written beautifully illustrated book of hers that tells a story with simplicity and aplomb.

Picture Book (Awards))	Books	4	41	41	N	N	Teach your children the chemical composition of a combustion reaction in verse.  Really!	Elementary school teachers everywhere knew the wonders of the Scieszka/Lane picture book, \\"Math Curse\\" and its use in getting kids to get interested in basic mathematical concepts.  Nearly a full ten years after the publication of that well-known title, the infamous writer/illustrator pair have returned with a sequel of sorts.  Entitled, \\"Science Verse\\", the book is a quick look at a variety of chemical, biological, and physical sciences that introduce kids to common terms and (if they read it enough) may even accidentally teach them a fact or two.  Parents be warned: If your five-year-old comes walking up to you with this book clasped in their clammy little hands, they may well ask you something along the lines of, \\"Mom, what's a carbohydrate?\\" or \\"Dad, what's a flavored quark?\\".  Better do your research now before they do.<br /><br />In this book our young balding child hero (seated in class next to the kid from \\"Math Curse\\", no less) listens to his teacher saying, \\"...if you listen closely enough, you can hear the poetry of science in everything\\".  Without further ado, our narrator explains that, \\"Mr. Newton has zapped me with a curse of Science Verse\\".  What follows is a series of different poems all discussing various scientific aspects of the kinds of things kids learn about in school.  Some of these poems will be bigger hits than others.  For kids, they're bound to enjoy the quick section neatly titled, \\"Why Scientists Don't Write Nursery Rhymes\\" as well as poems talking about the wonders of viruses, metal things touching electrical sockets, and some cute little four line poems that get the point across pronto.  Adults will enjoy Scieszka's mighty original take on Lewis Carroll's, \\"Jabberwocky\\" or a play on Poe's, \\"The Raven\\" that substitutes the familiar \\"Nevermore\\" with \\"Dinosaur\\".  The books ends, much as its predecessor did, with our hero waking up from his scientifically-inspired dream only to hear such dreaded words in his art class as, \\"Your art project must be your whole life\\".<br /><br />Not everyone, as you can no doubt tell by reading other reviews of this book, is particularly pleased with Scieszka's latest creation.  Some complain that the poems fail to scan correctly.  This is certainly true from time to time.  Once in a while this is intentional, but other times it's simply a matter of childlike laziness.  Will your kid throw this book to the floor in a huff over a line reading, \\"A poem that could make you shiver / Like 3.5 pounds of liver\\"?  Perhaps, but somehow I doubt it.  If you don't care much for humor, innovative plays on classic poems, or outstanding original illustrations then I suppose the lack of scan would wreak havoc with your reading experience.<br /><br />The book comes with a cd of Jon and Lane reading the book themselves.  Those songs that absolutely must be sung are done so by 2 mysterious and uncredited children.  To be frank, most of these poems should've been sung.  It's almost painful to hear a poem made to sound like, \\"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\\", read and not warbled.  The two guys seem to be having a high old time doing the cd though.  They rope in their editor at one point (which, as another reviewer noted, really does make them sound a LOT like the guys on \\"Car Talk\\") and put the telephone call on the disk.  They comment continually on how one poem resembles this famous one by Julie Ward Howe or that one to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.  Play your cards right and this could lead to your children reading the real poems willingly.  Educational, to say the least.  There's even a track on the cd where Scieszka talks about (and reads) poems that didn't make it into the book.  The short four-liners about various scientists may have kids wondering who the heck Marie Curie or Niels Bohr could have been.<br /><br />I won't tell you that every kid's gonna love this book because it's just not true.  Some kids don't like poetry, no matter how well you spruce it up.  Others won't touch anything science related with a ten-foot-pole.  But for some kids, those who like the natural sciences and are not opposed to literature as well, this book is a bit of a boon.  I would've made some changes to it, sure, but all in all it's a strong addition to any library collection (public or personal).

If the writer is not completely comfortable with the time period they're writing about, they'll hang everything on a famous person and leave it at that.  When I saw that this book was entitled, \\"The Shakespeare Stealer\\", I was sure that it would be a book in which a young boy befriended the great William Shakespeare and had an impact on history, yadda yadda yadda.  But Gary Blackwood's not your everyday run-of-the-mill writer.  There's a truly interesting story at the heart of this tale and a truly talented hand behind the writing.  Blackwood doesn't just place his book in the past.  He authenticates it by drawing you back into a fully realized historical moment in time.  The result is a whole lot of fun and a book that I'll be shoving into the hands of any kid forced to read something realisitic for a book report.<br /><br />Widge received his odd name when the mistress of an orphanage took one look at him as a babe and said, \\"Och, the poor little pigwidgeon\\" (thereby surprising anybody who thought that J.K. Rowling had made up the name).  Since birth the boy has been either an orphan or a lowly apprentice.  He was put under the thumb of one Dr. Bright when he was seven, and through this master he learned a form of shorthand that no one else in the world knew.  Such a talent is bound to attract interest, however, and at the age of fourteen Widge is bought by a man who needs the boy's talents professionally.  Sent to London, Widge is told to watch a performance of Hamlet and take down every word.  A series of small mishaps land him not in the audience, however, but as a member of the acting troupe.  Now the boy who never had a family must learn about courage, trust, and friendship from a group of people who prance about in silly clothes all day.  The only question is, will his old master give him up so easily?<br /><br />The book plunges you headfirst into the late 1500s/early 1600s without further ado.  Reading Blackwood, you become acutely aware of just how dirty, dank, and smelly England was during that time.  Because Widge is such a greenhorn to the sophistications of London, Blackwood has a perfect excuse for explaining everything.  Our hero doesn't understand the presence of drainage ditches alongside busy streets, or how to fence, or what a duel constitutes, so kids can learn alongside him.  What was most impressive in my eyes, though, was Blackwood's command of language.  Poorly written novels set during Elizabethan England like to throw around a lot of \\"thees\\", \\"thys\\" and \\"thous\\" for good measure.  Widge, for his part, is from Yorkshire, so his words and accent are different from even those Londoners he comes to join.  The book remains readable for 9-year-olds but also feels authentically Shakespearean.  No mean task.<br /><br />At its heart, the book is really about the beauty of performing on a stage.  If you know any kid that's lured time and again to the glory of the limelight, they'll have little problem identifying with Widge.  This is a book that celebrates the stage, while couching its tale in murder, fast-paced action, likable characters, and a certain amount of dramatic tension.  And for those of you who'd be disappointed if Mr. Shakespeare didn't appear in a book bearing his name, rest assured that he does put in a couple appearances when the fancy strikes.  Altogether, this is one of those rare titles that'll appeal to both boys and girls equally.  Fine reading.hout further ado.

Maybe Ben & Jerry's Chocolate Fudge Brownie ice cream, but that's about it.  For me, a book that reads well to large screaming hoards of five-year-olds is worth its weight in gold.  I don't know how I missed the publication of \\"Old Cricket\\" back in 2003, but I give you my solemn word of honor that it will rarely find itself anywhere but in my finest storytime collection from now on.<br /><br />On a fine clear morning Old Cricket wakes up on the wrong side of bed.  He's feeling particularly cantankerous and his missus tells him in no uncertain terms to fix the roof.  \\"You don't get to be an old cricket by being a dumb bug\\" the text informs us, so Cricket makes up an imaginary creak in his knee to get out of the job.  While en route to the doctor (or so his wife thinks) he meets up with his cousin, Katydid.  She asks him to help pick some berries off the bush, but Old Cricket adds a fake crick in his neck to accompany the supposed creak in his knee.  You see where this is going.  Ants ask him to help them bring in the last of the corn and a crack in his back is the additional malady.  It's only when he meets up with Old Crow who wants to eat him that his tricks no longer work (\\"You don't get to be an old crow by being a birdbrain\\") and he develops every physical ailment that he invented in the process of running away.  In the end, Cricket does visit Doc Hopper (who's name will remind certain members of my generation of the villain in \\"The Muppet Movie\\", I'm sure) and is cured.  So it's homeward to fix the roof and a happy ending for one and all.<br /><br />The text reads aloud beautifully with lots of different voices, plenty of \\"cricks\\" \\"creaks\\" and \\"cracks\\" to sound out the text, and a fast-paced chase sequence for those who weren't paying attention at the beginning.  Author Lisa Wheeler has slowly been making a name for herself and I look forward to reading other titles of hers like \\"Sailor Moo\\".  The repetition in this book works beautifully for younger readers and I daresay this would make an excellent storytelling tale sans book if it came to that.<br /><br />Not that you should forget about the gorgeous pictures accompanying the text.  Rendered in acrylic paints, artist Ponder Goembel (who's first name I may well steal for my own child someday) throws her back into this book.  Every animal here is rendered realistically with a kind of gently shaded sheen.  Leaves sport natural holes and bites, and though every animal (with the exception of the nudist ants) wears clothing in this tale, it never looks unnatural or out of place.  Old Cricket, for example, doffs a worn red cap and what looks to be a fisherman's vest when he goes out into the world.  I especially enjoyed the little details that appeared here and there.  Old Cricket has only one antennae, a fact that becomes crystal clear when he and the missus (also lacking that particular protuberance) pose in a final touching shot.  Even if your child is not reading on their own yet, they'll be delightedly poring through this book for hours and hours on end.<br /><br />I certainly hope that \\"Old Cricket\\" won itself a fair share of awards the year it came out.  This book needs to be on every reading list in the country for kids below the age of... oh say.... 72.

106860:US	49148452	R20SMR9FMAMUWC	0440445450	300942844	How to Eat Fried Worms	Books	5	83	92	N	N	Down goes the first one, down goes the second one, oh how they wiggle and squirm	To my mind, \\"How To Eat Fried Worms\\" is an American children's classic ranking just behind \\"Harriet the Spy\\".  In school, kids are constantly being forced to read books that, while excellently written, haven't a funny or amusing sentence anywhere to be seen.  This is a foolish act on the part of schools.  If you want your children to become good readers, you need to soften the meaningful with the flamboyant and silly.  I was actually expecting, \\"How To Eat Fried Worms\\" to be some kind of mildly amusing but essentially meaningless tale.  I certainly didn't expect anyone to actually EAT a worm.  Instead, I found that this is a brilliantly plotted war between two factions of friends and a book that can do a lot of good in teaching kids about rising action, climax, and satisfying endings.  Plus lots of worms get munched.<br /><br />When four friends, Billy, Tom, Alan, and Joe meet one day to discuss why Tom failed to join the others in a trespassing incident, they learn that he was kept indoors for not eating his dinner.  Billy, the group's unofficial leader, pooh-poohs Tom's finicky ways, claiming that he could eat almost anything.  This kind of statement leads to a dare.  Could Billy eat a worm?  How about fifteen worms?  How about fifteen worms in fifteen days for fifty dollars?  The bet is made, hands are shaken, and the rules are clear.  Billy can use any condiment he chooses and may eat the worms broiled, fried, baked, or however he prefers.  As the contest continues, Alan and Joe attempt to find ways to win an increasingly desperate war against Billy.  They try psychological warfare.  They try out-and-out cheating.  They try using Billy's parents against him.  They try using Billy's greed against him and at the last minute come up with a plan that very nearly finishes their friend for good.  This all inevitably leads to fights, panicked late-night worm hunts, and an ending that will have kids gripping the edge of their seats as Billy's little brother Pete comes through at the last minute.<br /><br />At the heart of the tale, however, is the worm eating.  It's funny, but as the years have gone by the covers for \\"How To Eat Fried Worms\\" have grown more and more explicit.  At first they wouldn't even show a worm.  In the 1980s the cover displayed two kids presenting two others with a steaming silver plate of ... something.  Now, at last, the worm is displayed on the cover in all its magnificent ickyness.  Rockwell balances out the gross with the funny with the thoughtful.  Some reviewers of this book have shown confusion over such chapter headings as \\"Admirals Nagumo and Kusaka on the Bridge of the Akaiga, December 6, 1941\\" or \\"Guadalcanal\\".  I don't think it takes too much intelligence, however, to determine that these titles show that the boys are in a state of war.  It's mind against not-so-queasy stomach and the stomach seems to have the obvious advantage.  Reading this book, kids get easily sucked into a slowly escalating battle between two desperate sides.  It's like a war without much in the way of pain and blood and gore.  By the way, the original pen and ink illustrations by Emily McCully (who later went on to give us the Caldecott winning title, \\"Mirette On the High Wire\\") are simple but effective, complimenting the text very nicely indeed.<br /><br />I'd like to state for the record that those of you who eschew this title without having read it are doing yourself a disservice.  This is a consistently amusing, intelligent, and really well-written title that'll get even reluctant readers engrossed... and grossed.  To those schools who already assign this book for Summer Reading I commend you.  To those schools who do not, I would like to point out that \\"How To Eat Fried Worms\\" was originally published in 1973.

You're constantly compared to your older siblings.  It's difficult to get any respect.  You struggle just to get your voice heard.  Yingtao, the youngest member of the Yang family, has it even worse though.  Not only are all his older siblings talented in the ways of music, but his mother and father have dedicated themselves towards the art and find the notion that Yingtao is tone-deaf inconceivable.  How could this happen?  Whatever the cause, the family has bigger issues than their youngest child.  They've moved to Seattle from China and money is a constant concern.  Yingtao, meanwhile, befriends a boy named Matthew at his school who's problems are the exact opposite of Yingtao's.  Where Yingtao only wishes to play baseball and is instead forced to practice the violin, Matthew is forced to remain on the baseball team while in his heart he years to play a fiddle of his own.  By putting their heads together, the two boys come up with a plan that will free them both from their family's expectations.  IF they can pull it off.<br /><br />Lensey Namioka skillfully pilots a potentially tricky plot into easy reading territory.  Kids who are comfortable with chapter books but still shy away from 500 page fantasies may find comfort in this unprepossessing little story.  Yingtao is a likable narrator, describing his inability to play the violin in tune with humor and resignation.  He obviously knows his family very well and is far more forgiving and far-sighted than they are when it comes to individual flaws.  Namioka handles the contemporary Chinese immigrant experience with a sure hand.  There's a great moment where Yingtao and an Asian-American student have a serious miscommunication as to the origins of the other.  If nothing else, the book should clarify a tiny bit the difference between the Japanese, Chinese, and Koreans.  The illustrations by Kees DeKiefte aren't going to blow anyone away, but they'll be welcomed by kids who still need a couple pictures here and there to get through a story.<br /><br />The only problem I could potentially see with this book is the fact that after reading Yingtao's side of it, you find yourself not sympathizing with his older siblings in the least.  This is a real problem, since they've continuing books of their own.  One has to hope that they come off as slightly more sympathetic in future novels than they do here.  Otherwise the book is a great read for those kids who want good baseball fiction but who's parents want a book with a little more meat to it.  Consider paring this book with \\"Baseball Fever\\" by Johanna Hurwitz for another tale of a father not approving of his son's obsession with the game.  For those kids who'd like to read some excellent fiction on the experience of Chinese-Americans, kids who play the violin, kids who hate the violin, kids who play soccer, kids who hate soccer, and all the kids in between.be welcomed by kids who still need a couple pictures here and there to get through a story.   <br />  <br />The only problem I could potentially see with this book is the fact that after reading Yingtao's side of it, you find yourself not sympathizing with his older siblings in the least.

Take Cornelia Funke.  When she's up she writes imaginative novels like \\"Inkheart\\" and fun picture books like, \\"The Princess Knight\\".  When she's down, however, she's prone to resting on her laurels and not giving her books much thought.  \\"The Thief Lord\\", for all its ambience, wasn't her best work.  Neither, for that matter, is \\"Dragon Rider\\".  It's a perfectly fine book, but it feels as if Funke noticed the popularity of the 5 million boy-meets-dragon books out there, and decided to tap into an already drained market.  A quest novel that provides readers with a little too much same old, same old, but that kids will devour heartily anyway.<br /><br />When you think of dragons, you may think of treasure hoarding, malicious brutes without a sensitive bone in their body.  The truth, as it happens, is quite different.  Peaceful creatures that desire nothing so much as to drink a little moonlight and fly in its beams, the dragons of Scotland have lived in peace for hundreds of years.  Now, however, mankind is threatening these gentle giants and the dragons must find a new hiding home or perish.  The only real choice left to them is a place that may be more myth than reality called the Rim of Heaven.  When no one will volunteer to search out this last resort, a young but brave dragon named Firedrake sets out to discover the truth behind the rumor.  The only companion at his side is the snarky brownie Sorrel and the only warning he's given is, \\"beware of the Golden One\\".  Along the way, dragon and brownie pick up a human boy named Ben, a homunculus named Twigleg, and help from a variety of rats. Drawing closer to their goal, however, it becomes clear that the \\"Golden One\\" is none other than the mechanical dragon Nettlebrand and that he will stop at nothing to find all the remaining silver dragons in the world so as to eat them up.<br /><br />Though the title is \\"Dragon Rider\\" and there are large swaths of text where people ooh and aah over Ben being the prophecied Dragon Rider of prophecy, it's hard to ignore the fact that Ben really never does anything useful in this book.  He's like the obligatory human, added solely so that readers will have someone a little less furry or scaly with whom they can identify.  If Ben has any skill at all, it comes from his ability to read maps.  But does he offer priceless advice when Nettlebrand threatens our hardy heroes?  He does not.  Does he outsmart the villain or use his brains to win in the end?  He does not.  Does he even have a hand in the villain's final defeat at the book's end?  He does NOT.  Never has a children's title garnered so much buildup and ended with such a whimper.<br /><br />I sound a little harsh.  Maybe it's because I expect more of Ms. Funke.  Still, it's hard not to notice elements in this tale that seem like pale knock-offs of her previous books.  In \\"Inkheart\\" she had a weakness for names like, \\"Silvertongue\\" or \\"Dustfinger\\".  In this book creatures are named \\"Twigleg\\", \\"Gravelbeard\\" and \\"Shimmertail\\".  The scary parts are never too terribly scary (partly because the villain's more buffoon than serious threat).  The funny parts never too terribly funny.  I suspect that Funke intends there to be a sequel to this book as well.  How else explain random plot points (like the fact that Twigleg has the same lifespan as whosoever he gives his heart to?) that go nowhere and do nothing?  And while I'm mildly ranting, did anyone else notice that no matter where they went in the world, the humans in Funke's illustrations always looked white and European?<br /><br />Does any of this occur to kids as they read it?  Not a jot.  They eat up this book like it was candy.  In spite of its 523 page length, I can't keep \\"Dragon Rider\\" on my library's shelves.  Full commendation to the fold-out map that accompanies the action, by the way.  Not only does it compliment the book perfectly, but after multiple readings by dozens of children it remains unripped and spotless every time you open the book.<br /><br />There's enough of Funke's signature style in \\"Dragon Rider\\" to lure any child with even a passing interest in dracology.  Though it is by far Funke's least well-written work, it still has enough verve to get away with a lot.  Too long and too repetitive but at least it doesn't bore.ings by dozens of children it remains unripped and spotless every time you open the book. <br />  <br />There's enough of Funke's signature style in \\"Dragon Rider\\" to lure any child with even a passing interest in dracology.

Suddenly that little cat with the fancy footwear was garnering a lot more interest than he ever had before.  I've always wondered why this fairy tale was ignored by the Disney animation studios in their heyday.  Now if you're looking for the quintessential version of the tale, there are really only two illustrators to pick between.  You can either choose the multi-talented Fred Marcellino version (responsible for some of my favorite picture books like, \\"I, Crocodile\\" and \\"The Story of Little Babaji\\") or you can go the Paul Galdone route.  I personally have always found Galdone to be a bit of a bore, except in the cat department.  For some reason, Galdone was always particularly good at drawing amusing felines.  I'm not entirely certain why Amazon.com has decided to link these two titles with one set of reviews, but just to clear everything up I'd like to state that for all its charms I'm eschewing the Paul Galdone version of \\"Puss\\" and instead reviewing the Marcellino version in its stead.  May God have mercy on my soul.<br /><br />There once was a miller who had three sons.  At the start of the story the miller has kicked the bucket and the sons have divided his paltry legacy amongst themselves.  The youngest son is left with only a cat... but WHAT a cat it is!  The puss tells the man to give him a good pair of boots and once he has done so the feline will make his master's fortune.  The youngest son is fortunately a game sort (or perhaps he was merely charmed by the idea of a talking cat).  Whatever the case, he gives Puss what he wants and the story chronicles the animal's clever ploys.  He poaches wild game for the king.  He dresses his master all in finery and makes him out to be a Marquis.  In the last part of the book, Puss tricks an ogre who is half a sandwich shy of a picnic into becoming a yummy little mouse.  After subsequent inevitable gobblings on the part of the cat, his master marries the king's daughter and \\"Puss became a great lord and gave up chasing mice, except just once in a while for the fun of it\\".<br /><br />The book is a direct translation of Charles Perrault's original tale from the French by translator Malcolm Arthur.  Mr. Arthur is to be commended for it too, by the way.  Not only is the book infinitely readable, but its harsher moments are lessened through his wording.  In some versions of this tale, the youngest son's contemplations of eating his pretty puss might've come off as barbaric.  Here, they seem more wistful than malicious.  Likewise the parts where the cat threatens the peasants with agreeing to a lie with the threat that if they don't \\"you'll be cut up into sausage meat\\" strains credulity (or do they trust a cat in boots more than one not in boots?).  Still, there's something about the pacing of the tale that works in its favor.  This may also certainly be due to Fred Marcellino's illustrations, which are truly lovely.  The cat, for his part, is both charming and catlike.  The pictures appear to have been drawn in colored pencil or possibly pastels.  Whatever the case, they've a soft and hazy feel that compliment the tale to a tee.<br /><br />So if you're on the look-out of the definitive version of \\"Puss In Boots\\", there is no need to look further.  If the praise I've lavished on it does no good, consider the 1991 Caldecott Honor it garnered itself once upon a time.  A classic tale that constantly shocks me when I consider how few children actually know it.

At first, they're your own private secret.  The kind of thing you try to get all your friends into.  You get all their best work.  You belong to their fan club.  And you wonder why no else has ever been as intelligent as you are in finding them.  Then, one day out of the blue, they hit it big.  At first you're elated.  FINALLY, the world has come around to your point of view.  You feel utterly vindicated.  This feeling lasts for about three days, then comes crashing down around your ankles as you come to realize that now everybody and their mother wants a piece of YOUR discovery.  Such was the case with me and Diana Wynne Jones.  I was perfectly content to keep a large Diana Wynne Jones section in the children's library where I work.  I'd recommend her to any child who was suffering from Harry Potter withdrawl.  Then \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" was made into a film and everything changed.  Now she's the hottest item since sliced bread and everyone wants a piece of her.  I wouldn't be surprised if \\"Archer's Goon\\" gets turned into a mini-series and \\"Dogsbody\\" ends up animated on Saturday morning cartoons.  Until that happens, however, I'll continue to read and recommend her works.  \\"Castle In the Air\\" is actually the sequel to \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\", and is in many ways more readable than its predecessor.  There's nothing quite as delightful as discovering a new book by your favorite author.  Even if everyone else in the world thinks that author's cool too.<br /><br />Abdullah leads an unremarkable life.  He's one of many carpet dealers in the city of Zanzib and he does what he does rather well.  He never makes a profit, but his stock has been getting more and more impressive as the years have gone by.  Mostly Abdullah dreams, though.  He wishes he was a prince or had a beautiful princess to love.  It seems that everything's going to stay the same until one day a shifty looking fella sells him a magic flying carpet.  While asleep on it one night, the carpet takes him to the beautiful Princess Flower-in-the-Night, with whom he falls instantly in love.  It's really just his bad luck that a passing djinn steals her soon thereafter.  To rescue his princess, Abdullah must match wits with genies, desert ruffians, cats, soldiers, wizards, and roughly thirty kidnapped take-no-prisoners princesses.  Fortunately, he has the cast of \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" to help him.<br /><br />I don't mean to start conjuring conspiracy theories, but it seems to me that the 1992 Disney film \\"Aladdin\\" definitely swiped a few of its better ideas from this 1990 publication.  The flying carpet belonging to Abdullah has a great deal of personality and charm about it.  The genie is prone to as much mischief as it can muster.  You have a handsome young hero who lies to a princess about being a prince himself and a princess who's not afraid to take charge when needs be.  But here the comparisons fall short.  \\"Aladdin\\" for all its charms is a very simplistic movie.  \\"Castle In the Air\\", by comparison, is complex.  It has the obligatory Jonesian twist endings (one that fans of its predecessor will appreciate immensely) and a hero that remains a nice guy in spite of all the nasty critters, creatures, and heavenly beings about him.  I especially enjoyed Jones' attention to djinn details.  This book doesn't delve into the matter of genii and their kin as deeply as Jonathan Stroud's, \\"Bartimaeus Trilogy\\", but she's at least familiar with her King Solomon.<br /><br />The real question here is whether or not fans of \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" will consider this a sequel or not.  After all, even though the characters from the previous book really do appear in this one from page eight onwards, they're not particularly recognizable until page 195.  This is bound to disturb those readers that want something identical to \\"Howl's\\".  To them I say, tough beans.  Jones isn'tthe kind of author you can pin down and ask to do something as dull and rote as a mindless sequel.  If she's going to continue a story then she's going to do it in her own inimitable way.  Those readers who've not read \\"Howl's\\" may find \\"Castle In the Air\\" to be less to their liking than if they had read it.  A word of warning to those who care to listen.<br /><br />If anything, I was a little worried as to how the Middle Eastern community would feel about this book.  Though Zanzib is obviously a fictional location, it borrows heavily from \\"Arabian Nights\\" and other tales of that nature.  People like Abdullah are prone to flowery language and lofty speech.  This may not be to everyone's liking, but since I've  looked through every single review of this book on Amazon.com one by one and not found anyone else seeing this as a problem, I must assume that this is, if anything, a small flaw.<br /><br />In the end, this is a truly enjoyable book and one that stands on its own two feet with little difficulty.  Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find the ending trite or too neatly tied together.  I just thought the book was a truly enjoyable tale with people you enjoyed reading about and a some descriptive passages that play out beautifully.

111137:US	49148452	R2UITPYPV8S1J9	0689865635	564816842	Indigo's Star	Books	4	4	5	N	N	'Cause Indigo you're a star, in nobody's mind but mine	I'm the first one to admit that I was not bowled over by Hilary McKay's, \\"Saffy's Angel\\".  I thought it was all right, but that there were some serious problems in the narrative.  The family was just a little too quirky.  The mother was absent-minded and negligent, while the father (who was the only person who took care of the kids when they were sick and in the practical sense) was seen as the villain.  There was a preciousness to the novel that turned me off.  It's not entirely surprising, then, that I approached \\"Indigo's Star\\" with a great deal of trepidation.  You can imagine my relief when I discovered the book to be an amusing and mature look at bullies, children dealing with changes in their families, and absentee parents.  It still tries too hard to be lovable at times, but the book's a good read.  Better than its predecessor by far.<br /><br />Indigo's been thoroughly happy with his life recently.  Having come down with mono, he's been sick at home (and away from the bullies of his school) for weeks and weeks and weeks.  Now, however, he's better and school is looming once again.  Going back, he finds that almost nothing has changed.  The bullies still have it in for him.  The place still is noisy and has that peculiar school smell.  The only real difference is that now Indigo's met the new American boy, Tom.  Tom's moved to England to escape his father and insipient step-mother.  He's angry, alone, and cares only about a beautiful black guitar he's seen in one of the shops in town.  Suddenly Tom's adopted by Indigo and his eccentric family.  Little sister Rose adores Tom at first sight and can't bear  the thought of his going back to England.  The rest of the family takes him in as they have with so many other strangers before.  By the time Tom's stay is at its end, he's come to grips with a lot more than how to get himself a new guitar.<br /><br />Though it's called \\"Indigo's Star\\", and much of the story concentrates on Indigo himself, the real star of the show in this book is little sister Rose.  Rose was always the character I had the biggest problems with.  A person who cares primarily about herself and her own needs, Rose was unreadably precocious in \\"Saffy's Angel\\".  Here, McKay has allowed Rose a little more maturity.  She's still demanding and outrageous, but this is tempered slightly by a new obsession.  Rose has noticed that the family's patriarch, the snobby artist Bill, never comes home to the family anymore.  It becomes her goal to get him back by any means necessary.  This usually takes the form of letters, which grow increasingly inventive and funny as the book wears on.  I was particularly pleased with a letter in which Rose talked about her older sister getting married and then threatens Bill with paying for the whole thing if he doesn't come home soon.  Bill still is an overblown but responsible figure in this story, something that McKay acknowledges a little more by the end.  So while I wasn't entirely comfortable with making the person who thinks to get his youngest daughter a pair of glasses a villain, it's hard to deny that his abandonment is anything but the work of a true jerk.<br /><br />As for the story itself, it's rather good.  McKay's always been stronger on plot than characters (which is a completely personal opinion on my part).  Indigo's journey, culminating in a confrontation with the bully on the bridge, is believable.  Tom's eventual acceptance of his new family works within the book too.  Altogether, there's  a great deal of growth and change going on in \\"Indigo's Star\\" that made for a satisfying read.<br /><br />I don't think I'll ever become a full-fledged member of the Hilary McKay fan club.  Be that as it may, I tip my hat to her over her second installment in the Casson series.  If you've never read a book about this family before, I urge you to start here.

112186:US	49148452	R3QQJOLZ9CJPL7	0525444750	670305507	Buster's World: 2 (English and Danish Edition)	Books	3	2	2	N	N	La-la la-la, la-la la-la, Buster's World...	Ah.  Danish children's books.  They don't exactly glut the American marketplace, do they?  If you were to ask most children's librarians in the U.S. to name three Danish children's authors the most they could probably manage would be a tentative Hans Christian Anderson (followed by a heady amount of hemming and hawing over whether he was actually Danish).  No one ever considers lesser known author Bjarne Reuter, and this is a pity.  Consider, if you will, the fact that he created the terrible popular (in the Netherlands) Buster series.  This is a man who has written screenplays that have won the Palme d'Or at Cannes as well as Oscars for best foreign film.  If he is remembered for anything in libraries, however, it's probably for Buster.  A winning if somewhat disjointed tale of an up and coming young magician, \\"Buster's World\\" almost makes up in heart what it lacks in cohesion.<br /><br />The life of Buster Oregon Mortensen is not easy.  His father's a charming if inconstant drunk/magician.  His mother has the thankless job of hiding the family's money and actually earning what little wages she can.  His sister was born with one foot shorter than the other but is otherwise a perfect angel.  And Buster himself?  Well, he's the unlucky target of a particularly nasty fifteen going on sixteen-year-old.  On top of that he's always getting in trouble for his magic tricks and his grades are nothing to admire.  What saves Buster is his unwavering faith in magic, love, and life.  He's head over heels in love with a girl that lives in a house not far from his own (though he doesn't even know her name).  He's quite certain that as long as he keeps thinking up magic tricks he'll get by.  And he's got a great delivery job that puts him in contact with all sorts of interesting people.  Life may be hard for Buster Oregon Moretensen, but not so hard that he doesn't know some tricks for making it fun.<br /><br />The book gets off to a rocky start.  As with many translated titles for children, the text has an odd herky-jerky quality, at least for the first few chapters.  Either author Reuter isn't sure how to balance Buster's depressing life with the beauty of the world around him, or translator Anthea Bell was new to the world of translation when this book came out in America.  None of this is to say that the book doesn't eventually even out a little.  In fact, Buster's antics overcome their inherently depressing nature and become quite funny.  There's the scene where he tricks a bully by making his fake arm look like it's falling out of its socket.  Or the time the principal asks him to remove everything from his mouth and he pulls out ribbon after ribbon and egg after egg.<br /><br />There's also the fact that, unlike in American kids' books, the Danes are obviously more comfortable with the human body than children in the U.S.  I say this because this is the only book I've read where the hero threatens a fellow student, while they're naked, with the unpleasant fate of having his penis pulled out by its \\"roots\\".  Squeamish parents, note this fact.<br /><br />In the end, it's hard to know what to make of \\"Buster's World\\".  It begins as too depressing for words and then ends up with Buster triumphant and everyone on his side.  The illustrations by Paul O. Zelinsky (who later on went on to win himself a Caldecott medal for his stunning \\"Rapunzel\\") are nice considering what little there are.  All in all, it's an interesting book, but probably not something a lot of kids are going to look forward to.

When I read \\"The Ironwood Tree\\" (number five in the Spiderwick Chronicle series, as I'm sure you well know) I speculated as to how it was possible that this, the final chapter in the series, would sum everything up.  There are after all a lot of issues waiting to be resolved.  You have Jared's constant anger and school problems.  There's the fact that the bad guy has somehow gotten a very important book from the good guys.  Arthur Spiderwick is apparently alive and well in the land of faerie, so he needs rescuing.  And what about all the magical creatures we've met up until this point?  Don't they get a final bow or anything?  Well, as it happens, this book does attempt to touch on each and every one of these points.  The fact that it's a little skimpy in some areas, that's another matter altogether.<br /><br />The book takes off running right from the start.  When we last saw our heroes, the Grace children had just escaped a pack of angry dwarves, only to watch those same dwarves be eaten.  Bloodily.  They're a bit shaken (understandably), so when the kids arrive home they're not exactly pleased to see their house torn to shreds.  Thimbletack, the house brownie, tells them that their mother has been kidnapped by the nasty uber-ogre Mulgarath and taken to his hideout.  Meeting once more the sly hobgoblin Hogsqueal (who's nose resembles nothing so much as a somewhat lumpy Christmas tree), the ramshackle crew sets out to save their mother, defeat Mulgarath, and take possession of the \\"Spiderwick Chronicles\\" for the last time.<br /><br />To me, the thing that set \\"The Spiderwick Chronicles\\" apart from other younger reader fantasy fiction was the amount of attention the series spent on Jared's post-divorce anger.  This was a kid that wasn't dealing with his family's break-up easily.  The series reinforced this notion with continual references to Jared's inability to control his own emotions.  I was skeptical as to whether or not the final book would wrap up this delicate theme, and I was right to be so.  In this book, Jared goes through the typical denial-of-the-father moment (quite literally in this case) and apparently that solves everything.  I, for one, could have stood a little more complexity from a series that continually impressed me every step of the way.  To find this book descend to the level of \\"merely passable\\" is a disappointment, to say the least.<br /><br />Not that the rest of the book isn't any good.  It is!  Quite, good, in fact.  The villain is a definite threat, the heroes use their wits and intelligence (as well as the obligatory \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" sword scene) to defeat him, and in the end death is seen as an inevitable and understandable part of life.  All in all, heady themes for a book intended for such young readers.<br /><br />Even the kitten survives.  Yes, if you're looking forward to the final chapter in the series, \\"The Wrath of Mulgarath\\" isn't a bad way to go.  I, personally, would've enjoyed a little more thought (and a little less blatant advertising on the endpages for future spin-offs).  However, I concede that this is a worthy successor to the series.  A fine book and a satisfying, in most ways, conclusion.e theme, and I was right to be so.

I, personally, would've enjoyed a little more thought (and a little less blatant advertising on the endpages for future spin-offs).  However, I concede that this is a worthy successor to the series.  A fine book and a satisfying, in most ways, conclusion.	2005-08-13

Year after year this company churns out remarkable historical, scientific, and cultural tomes that are not only readable, but also lively, informative, and well-researched.  \\"With Courage and With Cloth\\", one of the very few children's books to delve into women's suffrage in any depth, is no exception.  It offers amazing information that everyone should know, and so few do.  Unfortunately, it suffers from its format.  While the text is brilliant and the pictures sublime, the layout of the book will undoubtedly turn off some readers, while those seeking information about the photographs will be up a tree.  A fine fine book that could've used some fine fine tuning.<br /><br />Author Ann Bausum has this to say about American history. Learning about history in school, \\"I knew all about Washington and Lee, Marshall and Eisenhower.  History seemed to be a progression of stories about men and wars and conquest\\".  How much did any of us learn about women getting the vote in school?  As I recall, it consisted of one or two sentences in a textbook amounting to something like, \\"And then in 1920, women were given the right to vote under the 19th Amendment\\".  Goodnight, everybody!  The real story behind that teeny little sentence, however, is immense.  It's a story that spans more than seventy-two years and was won with literal blood, sweat, and tears.  Through this book we meet great heroes like Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Sojourner Truth.  We hear about how the suffragists repeatedly split into two different factions and how these factions worked separately to bring about an amendment to the constitution.  We see the heroism of the women (dealing with particularly disgusting forced feedings, beatings at the hands of sailors, and rat infested cells) and witness their less than shining moments as well (in regards to their treatment of African-American women).  By the time the amendment comes to a vote and has to be ratified by thirty-six states, the book has become an edge-of-your-seat thriller.  You may know the ending already, but it's a heckuva ride getting there.<br /><br />Bausum writes in a style befitting of the heroes she's commending.  She never shies away from the movement's prejudices and problems, but at the same time it's clear that these women were particularly exceptional.  The book even goes so far as to include a section on the Equal Rights Amendment (something I can honestly say I have never before witnessed in a kids' text).  On top of that you have profiles of all the major players, a chronology of events, a resource guide, sources and acknowledgements, a bibliography, an index, and a list of books about the suffragists that I spent the better part of last night copying down so that I could read them later.  Obviously, I would have liked there to have been some more sections on the African-American women and their take on suffrage.  There's an excellent passage quoting Sojourner Truth's, \\"And Ain't I A Woman\\" speech and some mild references to racism in the south and within the movement, but these are kind of glossed over.<br /><br />The layout of the book is the only real problem with it.  The photographs that dot almost every page are accompanied by pale light brown captions that will be almost impossible to read if your child has less than stellar eyesight.  Also, some of these pictures are stunning or shocking to the point that you'd love to learn more about them.  Unfortunately, nine times out of ten the images you see here are given brief three to four line captions and then never mentioned in the text.  It makes for slightly frustrating reading.  The colors of the book (purple, brown, and white) are lovely, but don't quite make up for the difficult-to-read-text.<br /><br />But that's neither here nor there.  The fact of the matter is that the book fills a very great need.No library in the country is complete without it.

I ate up books like, \\"Wait Till Helen Comes\\" and \\"The Dollhouse Murders\\", like they were candy.  And had Cynthia DeFelice been writing back in 1987, I've little doubt that her books would've found their way into my reading lists as well.  DeFelice has made her name writing mysteries.  Some of these make use of the supernatural, and some do not.  \\"The Ghost of Fossil Glen\\", falls firmly into the former category.  The first in a series of mysteries solved by ghost-spotting Allie Nichols, the simplistic story is easy for most children to identify with.  This is a tale that is spooky without ever becoming disgusting or lewd.<br /><br />When Allie finds herself clutching the side of a steep cliff, she's justly terrified.  An avid fossil collector, Allie enjoys locating rare trilobites and other ancient creatures in the shale near her home.  This time, however, she's gone a bit too far to find the perfectu specimin and it looks like she's in over her head.  Fortunately, a calm voice appears to Allie and carefully talks her back down the cliff with a minimal amount of cuts and bruises.  The voice, it turns out, is that of a long dead girl.  Allie knows it wants help and revenge, but she's not certain how to give it.  Only by exploring the mysterious circumstances surrounding the old Stile home with her best friend Dub does Allie slowly uncover a mystery that's laid buried in her beloved Fossil Glen for years.<br /><br />The plot, such as it is, makes for fine reading.  It balances out Allie's fears and detective work nicely.  The subplots, however, are a little less entrancing.  As with all children's books in which kids learn about a murder, authors have to think up ways to keep the kids from telling the police.  DeFelice has chosen to go with the old Allie-tells-stories-so-everyone-thinks-she's-a-liar route.  Not only is this a fairly weak premise to begin with, but it's not particularly believable here either.  Allie never makes up a story and then proceed to believe it herself.  She gets good grades and doesn't get into trouble, yet her parents act as if her mildly interesting tales (which tend to consist of her coming up with reasons as to why the school cafeteria lady is so mean) should be treated as a mental disorder.  It almost capsizes the otherwise believable plot.<br /><br />But not quite.  For all its weakenesses, \\"The Ghost of Fossil Glen\\" is a fun romp with ghosts, a lurking murderer, and snobs getting their just desserts.  An enjoyable tale for any kid that needs a little more ghostly literature to peruse.makes up a story and then proceed to believe it herself.

I can sit down and devour a book, be it a child or adult title, for hours at a time.  I am not deficient in my ability to concentrate.  I've even read all of Victor Hugo's, \\"Les Miserables\\" from cover to cover.  So why, I ask you, did I have so much difficulty reading Jean Craighead George's, \\"One Day In the Alpine Tundra\\"?  I did, you know.  I'd sit down to read a passage from the book and find my eyes glazing over and my mind pondering such mundane subjects as, \\"I like bread.  I wonder where I can get some good sourdough?\\".  Then I'd shake myself thoroughly, sit back down to reread the same passage, and once again glaze over.  Once you get about halfway through this book, it's an easier read.  Until that point, however, you'd better be giving this book to a kid who is fascinated to the depths of their soul by alpine tundra info.  Because if a 27-year-old children's librarian can't read five pages without yawning continually, I don't look favorably on your offspring's chances.<br /><br />The book opens with information about a large boulder that sits 10,000 feet up on the Rendezvous Mountain in the Tetons.  It's just about ready to plummet to the ground and in its path is a boy's tent.  The boy is asleep, though he slowly begins to wake as the sun comes out.  Various mountain animals also pull themselves together and go about their daily routines.  A marmot (mountain woodchuck) offers warning cries whenever predators are about.  A family of pikas (rabbits without the long ears) gather and dry food for the coming winter.  Birds fly and hunt, mammals eat in preparation for hibernation, and elk call to their mates.  The boy leaves the destructive area and begins to climb higher when a violent storm hits.  He finds safety but the boulder at last works its way free and an avalanche of rocks and boulders destroys everything in its path.  We can safely assume by the end that the weasel and marmot that we met earlier in the tale have been killed, but the pika is still there.  Finally, a bit of lichen drops onto a gash created by the falling rocks.  \\"The healing began\\".<br /><br />You'd think that any book that begins with a boulder just waiting to land on a boy's head would be a thrilling read.  You would be wrong.  Once George begins talking about the daily interactions between various alpine tundra animals, the story picks up the pace.  Until then, however, you have to deal with sentences like, \\"In Souther California's Sierra Nevada it starts at 10,500 feet.  In the Teton Mountains of Wyoming it appears at approximate 9,500 feet, and in the Cascades and Olympic Mountains at 6,500 feet.  The alpine tundra on the Presidential Range of New Hampshire is low, between 4,200 and 5,00 feet...\\", and so it goes.  This kind of talk goes on for long periods of time, gently lulling the reader to sleep.  My advice to kids that are assigned this book in class is to skip all the stuff that isn't about animals.  The wildlife portions are quite lively, and with good reason.  Jean Craighead George is kind of the patron saint of the realistic children's animal novel.  From \\"My Side of the Mountain\\" to \\"Julie of the Wolves\\", she knows her stuff, and it shows.  Unfortunately, she has a difficult time balancing factual information about her setting with interesting information about its inhabitants.  By the time you finally get to the cataclysmic storm, half your fourth-grade readers have given up on the book.<br /><br />A good edit could've saved this title.  Because of the nature of its subject, this book doesn't age.  Its pen and ink illustrations (provided by artist Walter Gafffney-Kessell) are wonderfully realistic additions.  Unfortunately, no such edit exists and the dull 14 or so pages at the start will turn-off potential kid readers.  This can be a great read if you slog through its initial tediousness.  Otherwise, its just so much dead wood.the tale have been killed, but the pika is still there.

A Violin (Caldecott Honor Book)	Books	4	24	25	N	N	The rhythm of the night	Parents are all about infusing their children with a good jolt of \\"culture\\" while they're young.  \\"Culture\\" can mean a lot of different things too.  It can refer to theater, art, or even a full appreciation of orchestral performances.  Now the standard method of getting kids interested in orchestras can be summed up in four words: Peter and the Wolf.  For some people though, Peter just doesn't cut it.  They want something a little more basic.  A picture book, perhaps, that identifies different instruments in the orchestra in an amusing and (dare I say?) educational manner.  Enter \\"Zin! Zin! Zin! A Violin\\".  A proud 1996 Caldecott Honor title, the book is a catchy flouncy bouncy exploration of different orchestral sounds and the people that make them possible.<br /><br />In a lush orchestral hall, two cats and a mouse sit on an empty stage.  Then, a single trombone enters, \\"With mournful moan and silken tone\\".  He's followed by a trumpet who in turn is followed by a French horn, a cello, a violin, a flute, a clarinet, an oboe, a bassoon, and (finally) a harp.  With everyone in place, and the conductor stationed before them, everyone plays together in perfect harmony.  \\"It's the music that we all adore.  It's what we go to concerts for\\".  Each separate instrument has its own personality and poem.  The oboe sobs and the bassoon makes everyone laugh.  Lines like, \\"With steely keys that softly click / Its breezy notes so darkly slick / A sleek, black, woody clarinet / Is number seven - now septet\\".  As you can see, by reading this book kids learn not only what certain instruments look like, but also what groups of people between the numbers of one to nine (solo to nonet) are called.  Illustrator Marjorie Priceman (who has illustrated everything from books by Katie Couric and Jack Prelutsky to my personal favorite, \\"It's Me, Marva\\") gives us a nicely multiracial cast to enjoy.  She also spots the book with two cats, a mouse, and a dog.  Kids will enjoy watching the different situations and scenarios the animals get into as the human players go about their music.<br /><br />I've a real pet peeve with ostensibly \\"rhyming\\" picture books that don't scan or read particularly well out loud.  Fortunate then that \\"Zin! Zin! Zin!\\", not only scans beautifully but is so well-written that the words perfectly encapsulate with a minimal amount of syllables what we like best about certain instruments.  The book really has everything.  Bright and colorful gouache illustrations.  A fun cast of characters.  Catchy words in an informative text.  I know that there are a lot of meet-the-orchestra books out there, but how many have won as much praise as \\"Zin! Zin! Zin!\\" ?  A book that could make even the most adamant preschool-aged philistine into an honest-to-goodness cultural guru.ferent situations and scenarios the animals get into as the human players go about their music. <br />  <br />I've a real pet peeve with ostensibly \\"rhyming\\" picture books that don't scan or read particularly well out loud.

Author Kara Dalkey flies quietly under the radar, not attracting too much attention to herself.  Like some kind of authorial fairy, she drops delightful little books and stories hither and thither for those readers canny enough to discover her.  I first noticed Ms. Dalkey after reading her original take on \\"The Snow Queen\\" in the collected book of stories, \\"Firebirds: An Anthology of Original Fantasy and Science Fiction\\".  Aside from that, one of the only other works of children's fiction she's ever published is the unassuming but delightful, \\"Little Sister\\".  Culling myth, religion, and legend from a variety of sources and placing her book squarely in twelfth-century Japan, Dalkey produces a story in which the fantastic and the mundane integrate seamlessly with one another.  This is undoubtedly Dalkey's finest work.<br /><br />Mitsuko does not consider herself to be of much worth.  She is the younger sister of the stately and kind Amaiko and part of a rather noble family as well.  When Amaiko is engaged to be wed, Mitsuko is as thrilled as anyone.  All the more tragic then that while en route to their father's summer home, the girls are attacked by a clan of warrior priests.  Amaiko's potential husband is killed, sending his fianc&eacute;e into a stupor from which she will not leave.  Determined to save her sister from wasting away, Mitsuko sets out to find Amaiko's dead husband and bring him back (thereby bringing back her sister to herself).  Along the way she befriends a mischievous tengu, or shapeshifter demon.  She tells her tale to deities, visits various hells, meets her ancestors, and outsmarts her enemies time and time again.  By the end, the quest has not turned out the way she expected it to, but Mitsuko is no longer the trembling child she was when she began.<br /><br />The book is an interesting take on the lives of Japenese women in the 13th century.  Mitsuko begins the book with pounds of prejudice weighing on her head.  By the book's end, she's shed these ideas, though she still carries some of them with her unknowingly.  Her quest has the original bent of not being a search for her own beloved, but for her sister's.  She's like Orpheus's stand-in.  The quest itself bears many similarities to classic folktales like, \\"East of the Sun, West of the Moon\\", in which a young woman must make friends and defy enemies carefully.  What made the book so delightful, however, were the characters.  Mitsuko isn't your typical blank slate without thought or opinion.  She's feisty and opinionated, even if she suffers from a classic case of low self-esteem.  Goranu, the tengu who falls in love with her, is somewhat similar to the character of Nawat in Tamora Pierce's, \\"Trickster's Choice\\".  In both cases, crows are potential lovers as well as warriors.<br /><br />One of the best elements in the book were the poems that dot it continually.  I don't exactly consider myself a scholar of haiku.  For me, Jack Prelutsky's, \\"If Not For the Cat\\", is the height of haiku brilliance.  Dalkey, however, has a real ear for it.  No matter what her predicament is, Mitsuko continually composes little haikus to herself to keep her hopes up or to give her problems form.  These poems are small little jewels that encapsulate the action perfectly.  They're worth the price of the book alone.<br /><br />I don't imagine that \\"Little Sister\\" will get the attention it so richly deserves.  It's a ruby in the dust.  A beautiful little book hidden amongst  shelves of mediocre ones in bookstores and libraries everywhere.  But for the kids out there that like adventure and fantasy with strong female characters (and aren't afraid of learning a little about the late Heian period of Japanese history), there are few books I'd recommend as highly.she still carries some of them with her unknowingly.

Books for Youth (Awards))	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Howe's moving title	It seems odd to find that James Howe, author of the classic \\"Bunnicula\\" titles as well as the charming, \\"Horace and Morris But Mostly Dolores\\" series, would decide to make his next book a title to help kids deal with death.  There's nothing (as far as I could determine) in Howe's past works to indicate that he's been at all interested in writing \\"problem\\" titles for preschoolers.  There are many many picture books out there that deal with death and dying in ways that children can understand (the best, perhaps, may be \\"Angelo\\" by David Macauley).  Usually authors who wish to tackle this greatest of all changes in life start slow.  They write a couple first day of school books, then follow them up with divorce or adoption.  Howe, on the other hand, plunges headlong into both death AND living in a multi-religious family with \\"Kaddish For Grandpa In Jesus' Name Amen\\".  It's a fine title, but not what you'd initially expect from such a prolific writer.<br /><br />Emily's grandfather has died.  She remembers him very clearly from when she was two and when she was four.  Though she doesn't understand much about death, her parents patiently explain to her what it means and what has happened to grandpa.  \\"Daddy explained that when Grandpa died he had left his body behind because it had grown old and worn out\\".  Grandpa's family was Christian so the service for him will be held in a church.  Emily's family, however, is Jewish so they celebrate his life with a Kaddish in their home.  In the end, Emily knows that the best way to remember Grandpa is to keep a part of him with her always.  \\"It wasn't the Christian way and it wasn't the Jewish way.  It was just my way.  My Kaddish for Grandpa in Jesus' name amen\\".<br /><br />Not a lot of children's books out there that have both the word Kaddish and the word Jesus in their titles.  A cookie to anyone who can think of another.  Howe's book is an interesting take on a beloved family member's death.  Emily never cries or acts particularly upset by her grandfather's passing, but I felt that this was an honest portrayal of how some kids deal with death.  This is one of those picture books that won't particularly move children any, but will reduce certain kinds of adults to tears after a first reading.  In fact, I was a little surprised to come to this Amazon.com page and not read something along the lines of, \\"We've read this book fourteen times and every time I find myself sobbing\\", or words of that sort.<br /><br />For all its heady writing, the book is sentimental without overdoing it. Catherine Stock's watercolors neither add nor detract from the overall feeling of the book.  Stock cut her teeth on intergenerational tales with the mighty popular \\"Gus and Grandpa\\" early reader series.  She is a rather prolific illustrator, a fact that is not touted loudly at all on the book's bookflap.  Most curious.<br /><br />Interfaith titles are always sought after in public libraries and private collections.  In this way, \\"Kaddish For Grandpa\\" kills several birds with relatively few stones.  It's a genuinely touching tale and James Howe takes to the material with a natural hand.

A mystery here, an intriguing character there, mix it altogether and phoomp!  One piece of child fiction for general consumption.  There are other children's books in the world, however, that resemble nothing so much as sumptuous feasts.  Books that you'd swear had more in common with three act plays and bewitching flights of fancy than you'd find in something like, \\"How To Eat Fried Worms\\".  You read one of these books, you finish it, and you scratch your head wondering how the English-speaking/reading children of the world lucked out to have THIS kind of book on their library and bookstore shelves.  Prior to this title, Eva Ibbotson was a kind of British pre-J.K. Rowling fantasy author.  Her books (like \\"The Island of the Aunts\\" and \\"Which Witch\\") were sweet but not particularly entrancing.  She treated her fantasy in an offhand kind of way.  As if ghosts and mermaids and selkies were only vaguely interesting characters to come and go as they pleased.  It seems obvious now that she's been toiling in the wrong genre.  \\"The Star of Kazan\\" marks yet another Ibbotson foray into a fantastical world that's almost too interesting to call historical fiction, but too informative to be relegated as anything else.  It is, without a doubt, her finest work put to paper.<br /><br />Annika has a daydream that's been hers and hers alone for years.  Found as an orphan in a deserted church, Annika dreams of someday meeting her real mother.  A mother who's rich and elegant and smells nice.  Not that the girl has a bad life of it.  She was adopted early on by a pair of servants who work for three neurotic professors in the heart of Vienna.  Annika loves her life, and has grown to be quite an accomplished cook.  She even befriends the dying great-aunt of the snobby little girl across the street and learns to deal with death.  Then, everything changes.  Like something out of a dream, Annika's mother (Edeltraut von Tannenberg) arrives and is just as glamorous and beautiful as her daughter could have wanted.  Without further ado she whisks her newfound child back with her to a drafty old mansion in Spittal, Germany.  Once there, Annika has a difficult time adjusting to her new life.  She makes friends with the local gypsy boy who tends the horses, but her half-brother is cold, the rooms are always freezing, there's very little food, and objects keep disappearing from the mansion.  It isn't long before Annika discovers a mystery that lies at the heart of her arrival in Spittal.  A mystery that will be difficult for her to unravel without friends.<br /><br />When I mentioned before that this book was like nothing so much as a three act play, I wasn't kidding.  I envy the schoolchildren of this world who may get a chapter a day from their teachers.  There'd be no better way to appreciate the trials of Annika and her quest to find love.  Stretching her literary muscles as far as they dare go, Ibbotson conjures up a Vienna that American children have never seen in such a magnificent light.  Born and raised there as a child (and sent away when she was eight) Ibbotson plumbs her memories of the time she lived in sweet Austria.  Here we can see horses that dance, a kind old emperor, and a tale that is much like \\"A Little Princess\\" but twisted deftly.<br /><br />What Ibbotson really revels in, however, are good characters.  Her books often include old women with moustaches or bratty children with spoiled attitudes.  Here, she writes a mother character that seems almost to be a blood relation of the chilling Mrs. Coulter in Philip Pullman's, \\"His Dark Materials\\" series.  Though Edeltraut rarely appears as anything but a beautiful mama, her slights and casual cruelties are almost invisible but frightening when discovered.  One of the things that impressed me the most, however, was the character of the gypsy boy Zed.  Gypsies are one of those ethnic groups that tend to get a beating in children and young adult literature.  Lazy authors love to use them for magical/mysterious moments, always forgetting that gypsies are real people who live real lives.  Ibbotson has not forgotten.  Better still, she's presented a well-rounded portrait of a group that lives as best it can without being any better or worse than their fellow men.  Zed isn't a dark mysterious boy with the ability to sense evil or nonsense of that sort.  He's a kid who loves taking care of horses and who does the right thing even when it puts everything he loves into peril.<br /><br />If there's a flaw to the book (and what, may I ask, is there on this good green earth that isn't flawed in some small way?) then it lies in the illustrations.  Kevin Hawkes has faithfully illustrated most of Ibbotson's books in America, and his style is almost synonymous with her name.  This is almost always a gifted pairing, but only when the topic is fantasy.  Here, Hawkes' lighthearted pen and inks don't seem to encompass the grandeur of the tale.  We hear that Zed is a thirteen-year-old with \\"thick, dark hair that looked as though it had been cut with shears - but his brown eyes were flecked with lighter colors, with bronze and hazel and with gold\\".  The boy in the pictures, by contrast, looks to be eight-years-old and sports incredibly short, only slightly curly locks.  This difference appears with almost every picture here.  With the possible exception of the shot of Annika cleaning the floor with dusters strapped to her feet, no drawing in this book lives up to the readers' expectations.  It would have been better to have left the book alone, sans illustration.<br /><br />But that's neither here nor there.  On top of everything I've already written, the book also has thrilling rescue sequences, good common people rising over and above haughty snobby people, redemption, falling harps, stolen jewelry, and a ferris wheel that can see the tips of distant mountains.  It's a long book, but a great one.  Kids who like their heroines good and their adults eccentric will find much to love here.  A fabulous read and a truly fulfilling story through and through.

131087:US	49148452	R25PZEBH3CO9M2	0439536308	340426817	The Princess Knight	Books	5	64	66	N	N	Funky Funke	You know, if American children's authors aren't careful, Cornelia Funke is going to become the number one most sought after children's author the minute J.K. Rowling finishes Harry Potter #7.  She's already become the number one most sought after German children's author (a cupcake to anyone who can name me another who's as well-known in America) and she solidifies her standing every day with books like, \\"The Princess Knight\\".  I admittedly was a little shocked by parents pooh-poohing the book because it begins with the death of the title character's mother.  How on earth do these parents read books like, \\"Snow White\\" or \\"Cinderella\\" to their kids?  Or do they just rely on Disney films instead?  And what about such classic picture book titles as \\"Babar\\"?  Does any and every book get thrown out if someone kicks the bucket?  Whatever the case, this is a fine fine book that gives the world a strong-hearted heroine who knows what she wants and how to get it.  Think of it as a kind of \\"Alanna\\" by Tamora Pierce, but for younger girls.<br /><br />When King Wilfred the Worthy's three sons were born, he knew exactly how to raise them.  They were taught fencing and fighting and horseplay and good manners.  When his daughter Violetta was born, however, he hadn't a clue.  His wife died in childbirth and rather than ask anyone else for help, Wilfred decided to raise his daughter like his sons.  Of course, being a girl she was physically smaller than her brothers.  Only through constant training was she able to carry her own and win their amazed respect.  When her sixteenth birthday comes up, Wilfred informs his daughter that there will be a jousting tournament for her hand on that day.  Apparently he hasn't completely forgotten that Vi's actually a girl.  For her part, Violetta is more than a little miffed.  Quoth she, \\"You want me to marry some dimwit in a tin suit?  Just look at your own knights!  They whip their horses and they can't even write their own names!\\".  This speech doesn't go down well with daddy dearest, but on the day in question Violetta concocts a plan that not only gets her off the hook but allows her to do what she wants for the rest of her life.<br /><br />I'm amused by the people that dislike this book because of the fact that Vi does indeed marry at the end.  The direct quote from the book is, \\"And who did she marry?  Well, if you must know, many years later, she married the rose gardener's son and lived happily ever after\\".  She marries on her own terms when she wants to and who she wants to.  So has the book sold out because it ends with the main character getting a man?  Dude, the book would have sold out if the author had felt that the character might have wanted a man but shouldn't have one for the greater good.  I'm all for books in which the female protagonists live their own lives without reliance on a male in some way.  This, however, felt right and worked within the context of the story.  Also, there's the fact that the book says, \\"if you must know\\", as if this was her own personal choice and not some gossip to be bandied about by loose tongues.<br /><br />Admittedly, for all the fine writing, Funke's book wouldn't have been half so successful if the book hadn't sported illustrator Kerstin Meyer's pictures.  Using the Bayeux Tapestry as her inspiration, the pictures here have a kind of spunk and verve that allow the whole enterprise to work smoothly.  The picture of Violetta bawling out her father is worth the price of admission alone.<br /><br />So, you've got a great story with delightful pictures and a wonderful message about women and their work.  There's nothing cloying or cutesy in Funke's tale.  Just honest-to-goodness well-written storytelling and a main character with enough verve and oomph to last four or five picture books more, should the author so deem it a good idea (hint hint).  A wonderful addition to any and every library.  Definitely consider reading it alongside \\"The Paperbag Princess\\".ech doesn't go down well with daddy dearest, but on the day in question Violetta concocts a plan that not only gets her off the hook but allows her to do what she wants for the rest of her life. <br />  <br />I'm amused by the people that dislike this book because of the fact that Vi does indeed marry at the end.

133943:US	49148452	R3D50OHA8LVK9P	0374375526	667685427	Tibet Through the Red Box (Caldecott Honor Book)	Books	5	16	16	N	N	(A) Free Tibet	I once had the great good fortune of seeing Peter Sis speak before a large audience of New York City Public Librarians.  Charming, blessed with an uncommon eloquence, and funny as well Sis spoke of his work over the last few decades.  From this speech I learned that Sis designed the poster for the movie of \\"Amadeus\\", that he was originally from Prague, and that one of his best works was something called, \\"Tibet: Through the Red Box\\".  I was intrigued, but months passed and I filed away \\"Tibet\\" into my To-Be-Read pile of picture books.  It was only with my steady reading of every single Caldecott Honor (of which \\"Tibet\\" won one in 1999) that I at last came to the book itself.  I expected a title that was some sort of early-reader-this-is-what-Tibet-is kind of a thing.  I had apparently forgotten that this was the man who brought us that remarkable Charles Darwin biography, \\"Tree of Life\\".  \\"Tibet: Through the Red Box\\" is no mere picture book.  It's a personal history and unreliable memory combined into the ultimate tribute to the author's father.<br /><br />In 1994 Peter Sis received a note from his father that said merely, \\"The Red Box is now yours\\".  Rushing home, Sis found the box in question and opened it to reveal a diary kept by his father of his time in Tibet in the mid-1950s.  Sis the elder was a documentary filmmaker, and as such he was sent by the army film unit to China to make and teach filmmaking.  The job was supposed to be about the Chinese highway currently being built in the Himalayas that would open Tibet up to the rest of the world.  While there, Sis was separated from his project and explored the world of Tibet deeper than (he suspected) any Czech citizen before him.  In this book, Peter Sis takes sections from this diary and illustrates them with his signature dotty style.  Interspersed with his father's written recollections, Peter includes his own childhood memories of the fantastical elements of the trip his father would tell him.  There were Yetis that cared for him while sick, and lakes filled with fish that had human faces.  The final meeting with the Boy-God-King, the Dali Lama himself, is expressed with riveting finesse.<br /><br />Back we go to that old question that comes up whenever a picture book doesn't fall strictly into a set category: Is it a book for adults or for kids?  Which is to say, will kids want to read it, or get anything out of it if they do?  And the answer, of course, isn't all that simple.  As many of the reviews for this book already state, there are multiple uses for this title.  Readers vary from reluctant teens to awe-struck ten-year-olds.  What I've always loved about Sis's work is his ability to write something meaningful for people of all ages.  So on the one hand you have a fun story about a father seeing fantastical things (it's no coincidence that Sis chooses to include a quote about Marco Polo at the end) and on the other hand you've a complex story of a son trying to figure out who his father is and at what price a world can be utterly destroyed.<br /><br />When I saw Sis speak, he made a self-deprecating statement that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.  Sis said that when he was first trying to get jobs, he though the best way to distinguish himself from everyone else was to draw using millions of tiny dots.  In retrospect, he realized this wasn't such a bright idea.  For while the dot style was unique and much sought after, it meant he had to spend countless hours dotting and redotting his books.  \\"Tibet\\" is dot-o-licious, this is true.  And while not quite as insanely detailed as the aforementioned, \\"Tree of Life\\", it still an eye-popping wonder.  My favorite section however, chronicled the father's trip through the magic palace of Potala, where every room is different.  There's a red room that is \\"sunrise and sunset, heart of time\\" and a green room that is \\"square and circular, ear of earth\\".  At this point the book begins to resemble nothing so muchas the book, \\"Maze\\" by Christopher Manson.  If you're a fan of crazy rooms leading nowhere at all, check out that book as well.<br /><br />Don't pick up \\"Tibet: Through the Red Box\\" if you're looking for some light picture book fare.  That is the number one wrong way to approach this kind of material.  Instead, fix yourself a hot cup of tea, snuggle on a comfy couch with a child or adult that you love, and page through the remarkable and touching story of one man's ode to his father.  We should all be so lucky to have done so much, lived so well, and be remembered in such an evocative way.so much as the book, \\"Maze\\" by Christopher Manson.

134180:US	49148452	R3I6JBGT5TFHPW	0066236029	821066747	Surviving the Applewhites	Books	3	28	33	N	N	Bagthorpes redux	There's a whole genre of children's literature that can be best categorized as Crazy/Artistic Family books.  Since the publication of Frank and Ernestine Gilbreth's, \\"Cheaper By the Dozen\\" (and possibly before that book as well) kids have enjoyed reading about large crazy families and their occasional sad sane members.  \\"Surviving the Applewhites\\" bounds gleefully into the ring to grab a little of this genre-glory and it's done pretty well for itself.  It garnered a 2003 Newbery Honor.  It's on countless Summer Reading lists around the country each year.  You'd never know that it was a knock-off, would you?  The fact of the matter is, \\"Surviving the Applewhites\\" is just a slightly contemporized version of Helen Cresswell's 1977 classic children's book, \\"Ordinary Jack\\".  Though it certainly has some nice ideas and nice moments, \\"Applewhites\\" is doomed to be remembered as the Newbery Honor winner that copied a better book, from its dog to its fire-loving preschooler.<br /><br />Jake Semple is a mean kid.  A mean spiked hair kid.  A mean spiked hair, multiple earrings, swear at authority figures, wear black clothing kid.  He's been kicked out of every school he's ever gone to until finally he's ended up on the Applewhites' farm.  The Applewhites are neighbors of Jake's grandfather (the last person the boy was dumped into the care of) and they're a bit... well.... a bit peculiar.  All the adults have amazing artistic talents, while the kids are developing their own particular styles in a kind of free-form classroom.  In the midst of this chaos is E.D. Applewhite, Jake's peer and an overly organized kid.  She doesn't trust Jake for one little moment, but the fact of the matter is that there are larger issues hanging over her head.  E.D. can't stand the loosey-goosey nature of the family.  She's not artistically talented so she feels left out of things.  It's only when her father ropes the entire family into helping with his production of \\"The Sound of Music\\" (with Jake as a lead) that E.D. and company learn how to best utilize their talents in a way that the world can really enjoy.<br /><br />There are nice things in the book.  Author Stephanie Tolan does wonderful things with butterflies here.  Throughout the story, E.D. and Jake work on projects involving butterflies, culminating with Jake's idea to hatch some black swallowtails in the home.  The result are butterflies that live with no fear of humans and become sort of family pets (an adorable idea).  It's a bit of a stretch to imagine that E.D.'s father's idea of colorblind casting \\"The Sound of Music\\" would be considered groundbreaking, but it works within the context of the story.  Children's books love colorblind casting musicals anyway (as in \\"Amazing Grace\\" by Mary Hoffman which did the same thing with \\"Peter Pan\\").<br /><br />The book is very nice if you haven't read any of the Bagthorpe books (like \\"Ordinary Jack\\").  If you have though, you're in trouble.  Consider the similarities.  In \\"Ordinary Jack\\", Jack is the only normal member of his crazy/artistic family and so he and his dog Zero interact with his demanding writer father, adorable blond firebug of a preschool cousin, and others to find out what makes him special.  In \\"Surviving the Applewhites\\", E.D. is the only normal member of her crazy/artistic family and so she and the family dog Winston (who loves Jack) interact with her demanding director father, adorable blond firebug of a brother, and others to find out what makes her special.  Oog.<br /><br />Jake himself is an odd sort.  He doesn't do anything even slightly delinquent aside from swearing once in a while and smoking cigarettes.  High crimes indeed.  His appearance is that of a punk, a fact that would have shocked other kids in 1977, perhaps.  Here, it's rather quaint.  He's like a throwback to an earlier innocent age.  If he had tried to look like Marilyn Manson he probably would've ended up a far more believable character.  After all, what kid today goes about spiking his hair anymore?<br /><br />Also, the book commits one particular crime that I am loathe to forgive and forget.  The aforementioned adorable preschooler is named Destiny (kill me now) and randomly speaks with an affected cuteness that is supposed to melt readers' hearts.  Instead, it only succeeds in inspiring jaw-dropping disbelief that any author would stoop so low.  Destiny is prone to sentences about his hair like, \\"Mine just growed.  My hair's blond.  Did you know they don't gots a blond crayon even in the sixty-four box?\\".  Gots?  The child is a menace who repeatedly annoys the characters, almost kills another kid, lights fires, and basically behaves in a manner that, in an attempt to be cute, ends up as sickeningly saccharine.<br /><br />There's a lot to like in this book, no question.  If you can get over the identical plot/characters and the awful blond child then the book reads rather nicely.  It STILL did not deserve the Newbery Honor.  Goodness me, no.  But it's a nice title that should be interesting to many kids out there.  I didn't personally take to it, but I can see how others might.  An overly simple book that will garner a large following.es about spiking his hair anymore?<br /><br />Also, the book commits one particular crime that I am loathe to forgive and forget.

In 2001 a book came out entitled, \\"The Name Jar\\" about a girl from Korea who had moved to America and wanted an Americanized name.  Then, in 2003, \\"My Name Is Yoon\\" came out with practically the same plot.  Normally, I have little sympathy for children's books that mimic their predecessors.  In this case, however, there can be little doubt as to which book is the better of the two.  \\"My Name Is Yoon\\", is a complex tale of imagination, flights of fancy, and gradual acceptance.  By contrast, \\"The Name Jar\\" was simply okay.  You can find ho-hum picture books lining the shelves of most libraries and bookstores around the globe.  It is far rarer to find books quite as remarkable as the stunning, \\"Yoon\\".<br /><br />Yoon isn't exactly thrilled to be in America.  Wherever she looks, she sees that life is different in this strange new land.  In Korea, where Yoon was born, her name meant Shining Wisdom.  Despite her father's assurances that it means the same thing here, Yoon isn't so sure.  And then there's the fact that when she writes her name using English characters, it's just a series of sticks and circles, whereas in Korean, \\"The symbols dance together\\".  She's right.  They do.  Yoon carries her unhappiness to school where each day she learns a new word and makes that her name.  One day it's cat.  Another it's bird.  Still another (and most amusingly) it's cupcake.  In the end, Yoon learns to like her new country, supposing perhaps that maybe that being different can be good too.  And in the end, she embraces her real name.  \\"It still means Shining Wisdom\\".<br /><br />I hate summarizing picture books where the plot, when written down, sounds so much hokier than it feels on the page.  What I've just written sounds nice but bland.  The book is anything but bland.  Yoon's a distinct and remarkable character.  With each new name she adopts, she becomes that object in her dreams.  For example, when she becomes BIRD she wishes she could fly back to Korea once again.  The book also skips what I've come to feel is the obligatory foreign-child-gets-teased sequence.  The kind of thing you tend to find in books like, \\"Molly's Pilgrim\\".  I was grateful for the oversight.  \\"My Name Is Yoon\\" is tackling more important problems here.  The acceptance of one's own self in a foreign environment, for example.  Becoming your own name.  Becoming your own self.  What could be greater than this?<br /><br />The pictures, for their part, don't hurt.  Artist Gabi Swiatkowska is perhaps best known for this book and the title, \\"Silk Umbrellas\\" by Carolyn Marsden.  \\"My Name Is Yoon\\" is good as a story, yes.  But the Yoon we see here is a complex original human being.  A one-of-a-kind gal.  When her imagination soars it takes off like nothing else, aided by Swiatkowska's realistic images.  I especially liked looking at the pictures of her in her home.  Here, the black and white tiles of the floor bend and twist in strangely surreal patterns.  I'll be honest with you, though.  The book could've been awful and I still would have loved it just so long as it continued to contain the picture of Yoon floating through her classroom window as a delicious fluffy cupcake.<br /><br />Realism is what grounds \\"My Name Is Yoon\\".  Surrealism sets it apart from the rabble.  If you're stocking your personal library with only the most essential picture books out there, you'd be doing yourself a disservice not to include this truly delightful title.e book also skips what I've come to feel is the obligatory foreign-child-gets-teased sequence.

The book has a distinctly British tenor to it.  A kind of Edward Gorey (yes, I know he was American) meets \\"Wind In the Willows\\" feel.  While some children may prefer their picture books to end on a somewhat less gruesome note, I believe firmly that for the kid with a mildly twisted sense of humor, no book can serve them better than this moderately dark picture book.  A great comeuppance on behalf of all the Red Riding Hoods of the world.<br /><br />Glenda and Horace Pork-Fowler (an ostrich-like bird and pig, respectively) are not particularly surprised when they receive a summons in the mail.  But then, they're really not the kinds of animals to be surprised by anything.  The note comes from the mysterious Mr. Hunter who recently purchased nearby Eatum Hall.  In it, the two are invited to a delightful week-end of food tasting, courtesy of Mr. Hunter himself.  Ever fans of the gastronomic, the two pack their bags and head to the mysterious Hall.  Once there, they find their host missing, but mechanical servants present who can attend their every whim.  Though there's something distinctly creepy about the place (the eyes in portraits follow the two everywhere, certain rooms in the home are always locked, and the bed seems to be some kind of scale) the two don't feel even a twinge of misgivings regarding their absent \\"friend\\".  It's only when Mr. Hunter's mysterious plans go a little too right that our friends return home happy (if somewhat larger) while Hunter's fate is reminiscent of the wolf in the original Grimm telling of The Three Little Pigs.<br /><br />Oh, why be coy?  I'll just come out and say it.  He gets eaten.  Baked into a pie and devoured (we can only assume) by other wolves who are last seen cutting into the large steaming dessert.  Is it a somewhat macabre ending to a somewhat macabre tale?  Most certainly.  Kelly and Tincknell have no qualms about foreshadowing Glenda and Horace's potential fate left right and center.  Though they cannot, sharp eyed readers will see the flit of a wolfy tail disappear out of one picture or view the two charming guests through far reaching binoculars.  Hunter is never seen clearly front and center, but you have no difficulty figuring out what he's up to.<br /><br />The illustrations are digitally created, which may strike the viewer as odd on first glance.  Though the pictures are beautiful, they seem like nothing so much as thick gouache or possibly acrylic paints.  There's nothing to suggest that these are pictures drawn, \\"freehand onscreen\\" in any way.  This is for the best.  You wouldn't want to read a story of this nature if it looked like it came from the same universe as \\"Finding Nemo\\".  The story is certainly British through and through as well.  The humor's just a bit too sardonic to be taken for something American.  Also, there are hints of British culture scattered hither and thither.  The fact that they are going to a Hall.  The name of the Pork-Fowler (love the hyphen) home is Dun Fastin (ho ho!). Things of that nature.<br /><br />Is this going to be a beloved book in the home though?  Will your children clamor for it to be read again and again to them?  No idea.  Certainly I realized rather quickly that this was not going to be a good title to read aloud to large groups.

Children world-round have undoubtedly heard this product in one form or another.  Whether it was John Denver on \\"The Muppet Show\\" (whee!) or in their preschools, \\"Inch By Inch\\" is, suffice it to say, well-known.  Fast-forward to 1995 and David Mallett goes the next logical step.  Whether he intended it or not, \\"Inch By Inch\\" is primarily sung to children.  And when you've a catchy and popular children's song under your belt, why not make it into a picture book?  Not all folksongs work as children's books (I've yet to see a well-done \\"Turn Turn Turn\\" or \\"Kumbiyah\\" though infinite books carry those songs) but \\"Inch By Inch\\" is that rare exception that when it works, WORKS!<br /><br />\\"Inch by inch / row by row / gonna make this garden grow / All it takes is a rake and a hoe / and a piece of fertile ground\\".  Sing along!  You know the tune!  Going through a variety of verses, we see a cheery child (possibly a boy, possibly a girl) doing some gardening.  The kid, faithful pup in tow, hoes the ground, plants seeds, pulls weeds, and removes stones.  The weeds and stones are amusingly huge, but the exaggeration works.  Though black crows threaten, the crop is full and hearty.  In the back of the book is the sheet music and lyrics for the original song itself.<br /><br />Illustrator Ora Eitan is thus far best known for \\"Bunnies\\" books, like \\"Astro Bunnies\\" and \\"Cowboy Bunnies\\".  Here, Eitan's distinctive style serves the book well.  The pictures are both simplistic and mildly detailed.  There's a great deal of fun at work here and it would take a hard-hearted child indeed not to want to grow something of their own after a reading.  There is one picture in the book that's a little out of whack though, not to say mildly disturbing.  With the lines \\"we are made of dreams and bones / Feel the need to grow my own / 'cause the time is close at hand\\" we see child and dog at the base of a treee, watering it.  On this two-page vertical spread a dog, identical to the one below, flies about the top of the tree's boughs on a pair of thin green wings.  Reading the words and seeing the picture you have to make one of two assumptions: either this is a dream of the dog below (who is not even remotely asleep) or the dog is dead.  The dog doesn't reappear for some time after this picture which would seem to back up this theory, but at last it ends up on the final page with the kid.  If Eitan's making a statement of some sort with this illustration, it's foggy at best.<br /><br />Otherwise, a fine fine book.  Parents adore this title, especially when they can remember the tune.  Vocally gifted or tuneless as a tank, it really doesn't matter.  The book's just a great little addition to anyone's garden centered storybook collection.  Consider pairing it with David Small's, \\"The Gardener\\" or Crockett Johnson's, \\"The Carrot Seed\\", the next time you get a chance to do a summer storytime.f a treee, watering it.

With \\"The Ironwood Tree\\", author Holly Black swerves strongly into darker territory.  Activities in the book are beginning to come to a head as the final chapter in the saga looms.  The book is not quite as light-hearted as its predecessors, but the writing remains as fine as ever.  Timid parents should beware.  Stout-hearted students should enjoy.<br /><br />At long last Jared and Simon are off to see their older sister Mallory compete in a fencing competition at the J. Waterhouse Middle School.  Mallory seems a little nervous, but that's probably just because she has a crush on her handsome fencing captain, Chris.  While watching, Jared noticed an odd-looking girl rifling through Mallory's things.  Some further investigation reveals that whoever or whatever the person is, they can change their shape at the drop of a hat.  When Jared threatens the creature with his knife, it turns into a small boy and runs crying down the hallway, leaving Jared with certain suspension and possible expulsion.  And if THAT wasn't bad enough, Mallory disappears shortly after the match.  Now Simon and Jared must battle a crew of deceitful dwarfs to get their sister back and finally view the evil Mulgarath for the first awful time.<br /><br />The ending of this book finishes a particularly nasty blood-laden note.  It is, however, necessary.  As with all books and movies in which evil villains appear, you have to be convinced that the bad guy really is... well, BAD!  Mulgarath, I assure you, passes the evil litmus test with flying colors.  The rest of the book for its part is fine without being remarkable.  One has to wonder how Black is going to wrap up the series if the final installment in the Chronicles is as slim as its predecessors.  Though there isn't an overwhelming amount of originality here, \\"The Ironwood Tree\\" remains a worthy addition to the deservedly popular series.whelming amount of originality here, \\"The Ironwood Tree\\" remains a worthy addition to the deservedly popular series.	2005-07-30
142969:US	49148452	R12ZOAJQM70NJS	0140157379	446962747	Haroun and the Sea of Stories	Books	3	18	28	N	N	Coo coo ka-choo	When adult authors start writing children's books on their own, they fit into one of two categories.  Either they have no prior child-lit experience and simply write stuff that they think kids would like (Elmore Leonard comes to mind) or they go 180 degrees in the opposite direction and worship those works of children's literature and folklore that they feel a special kinship towards.  In such cases as these, adult authors will write children's books or stories that owe a great deal of allegiance to \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" and \\"Alice's Adventures In Wonderland\\".  Michael Chabon and A.S. Byatt are guilty of this sin.  So too, though in a far more lighthearted way, is Salman Rushdie.  A self-proclaimed Wizard of Oz enthusiast (you could do worse than to read his 1992 essay on the subject), Rushdie ties his one and only kids' book to a host of literary, musical, and cinematic sources.  The result is a children's book for adults.  Like fellow author Byatt, Rushdie lacks the easygoing literary style that separates a book that is \\"good\\" for kids from something as highly enjoyable as the latest Harry Potter novel.  \\"Haroun and the Sea of Stories\\" is the kind of book to inspire operas.  Not children.<br /><br />Haroun's having a hard time at the moment.  His mother just ran off with the upstairs neighbor.  His father Rashid, the self-proclaimed Ocean of Notions and Shah of Blah (which is to say, a storyteller) has found himself unable to tell any more tales, what with his wife's abandonment and all.  As for Haroun himself, he can't concentrate on anyone or anything for any longer than eleven minutes.  When a local politician hires Rashid to speak at his upcoming rally, father and son travel without any particular high hopes.  Things take a turn for the bizarre, however, when Haroun wakes up the night before the rally to find a water genie in his bathroom.  The water genie has just attempted to turn off Rashid's connection to the Sea of Stories, the source of his once glib tales.  Haroun is having none of it, however.  With one of the genie's tools in his possession, he insists on clearing up this cancellation and instead finds himself embroiled in a magnificent war on an epic scale.  In the land of Kahani, Haroun must help new friends defeat the evil enemy of stories, Khattam-Shud, and preserve the precious Sea of Stories from pollution before all the tales in the world go terribly terribly wrong.<br /><br />This is a quest novel with two separate quests smooshed into a single hero.  Readers will note right from the start that much of this book is reminiscent of the film of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" (though not the original story, interestingly enough).  Always a fan of rock and roll, Rushdie also allows himself some Beatles references and a liberal (and well-utilized) smattering of Hindustani words throughout the text.  At the heart of \\"Haroun\\", however, is Rushdie's outraged cry against the jihad placed on his head after the publication of \\"The Satanic Verses\\".  Remember, \\"Haroun\\" was published in 1990 and even the lovely little dedication poem at the front of the book is a reference to the fact that Rushdie was unable to spend as much time with his son as he would have liked.  The result is a thinly veiled metaphor of a book in which a boy fights against someone who sees words themselves as a threat.  The tale is at its best when Haroun notes the good army bickering and debating each and every plan of action before going into a fight.  Haroun thinks that such talk would be considered mutinous anywhere else, but is reminded that there is little point in being given freedom of speech without being allowed to use it.<br /><br />The problem comes when you try to view this story as something kids would enjoy to read.  At first glance, it seems ideal.  There are funny animals and a likable hero with parent problems.  There's a villain of great evil and a fantastical world not too far from our own that anyone would like to visit.  But the book, for all its charms, is obviously meant for adults.  The moments when the title tries to be silly try a little too hard.  The characters you are meant to love are given only the lightest of descriptions.  For people like Mali, the vegetable gardener, you're supposed to root (ha ha) for them simply because they exist.  Not because they've won your admiration or liking.  Thankfully, Rushdie is redeemed in part when being funny.  Prince Bolo and his beloved Princess Batcheat are so blandly stupid that it's a joy to read about them.  Unfortunately, such moments of lightness are few and far between.  Kids who slog through this title will be far more interested in the premise than the actual product.  It is, in a word, dullish.<br /><br />Which isn't to say that die-hard Rushdie fans won't adore it.  Of course they will.  This is the master at work doing what he loves.  But just because an author is good at one form of writing (adult fiction) it doesn't mean he can slip effortlessly into another.  Children's literature is probably one of the most difficult forms of writing to do well.

This was in the days before the Internet, and my searches through periodical lists yielded paltry results at best.  I tell you here and now that I would have killed, KILLED I say, for this book.  \\"Albino Animals\\" is probably the best non-fiction book on albinism currently available to youngsters.  On top of that, the subject matter is just this side of fascinating.  In it, we are privy to some of the rarest and most beautiful animals in the world.  If you've a kid that absolutely has to read a non-fiction book on a topic of their choice, try persuading them along these lines.<br /><br />Author Kelly Milner Halls begins with a brief explanation of the reasons behind albinism.  She breaks down the complicated genetics between dominant and recessive genes and gives a thorough yet interesting explanation of what it means to lack pigment.  Then we're off!  The book is divided between the different kinds of animals in the world today.  There are reptiles, sea mammals, land mammals (both large and small), fish, birds, and an enticing chapter simply called, \\"The Rarest of the Rare\\".  Flip through some pages and you'll see sights to astonish and amaze.  Who knew that albino butterflies, carrying shades of the palest softest pinks, could be so lovely?  What about peacocks with feathers of a brilliant and entirely pure white?  Here you can view remarkable white spiky hedgehogs and incredibly lovely and stylish white Bengal cats.  Best of all are the stories Halls tells.  Whether you're learning about the life of Snowflake the white gorilla or how Mulali the albino kangaroo made a friend, the tales told here are as variegated as the creatures they speak of.  There's even a large section on various towns in America that have spent years cultivating themselves as homes to white squirrels.<br /><br />In the back of the book Halls makes sure to offer information on NOAH, the National Organization for Albinism (for people) as well as an impressively in-depth glossary of terms and Bibliography.  The Bibliography is so extensive that it catalogues the interviews performed by the author, the articles researched, books read, and websites cited.  This is information I would have killed for as a kid.  Best of all, your average child reader will find the text just as interesting as the drop-dead-gorgeous-photographs.  You'll come away from this book with a sense that people everywhere find albino animals in the wild to be beautiful and worth keeping from harm.<br /><br />I can't praise this book enough.  For fabulous factual information and pages of tales that anyone would find exciting, \\"Albino Animals\\" is, like its namesakes, truly one-of-a-kind.H, the National Organization for Albinism (for people) as well as an impressively in-depth glossary of terms and Bibliography.

The fact that a butterfly comes from a creepy little caterpillar.  The array of colors visible in a soap bubble.  And the perpetual unending ravenous hunger kids have for murder mystery tales.  They just can't get enough.  Hardy Boys books obviously were one of the first tales to capitalize on this need, but they were by no means the last.  Over the years various authors have made forays into the world of kids-solving-mysteries.  Some of the best also take care to tread closely to the original Hardy Boy formula.  You take a basic mystery (someone dies) and then add on a potentially supernatural element for the fun of it.  Even Scooby-Doo knows that there's nothing like a ghost or phantom to make an already creepy tale just a bit more enjoyable.  And few authors have adhered so closely to this formula as historical mystery writer (and resident Brit) Chris Priestley.  His books are basically Hardy Boys novels sucked back in time to the 1700s and involving (instead of two boys) a boy and a friend who happens to be an old and wise doctor.<br /><br />Like any other printer's boy in 1715, Tom Marlowe wants a lot out of life.  He wants to see the world and have some fabulous adventures under his belt.  He may only be fifteen, but Tom's been itching to get out from under his father's protective gaze for some time, and he enjoys spending time with his good friend and pickpocket Will Piggot.  When mysterious murders begin occurring in London, Tom's just as interested in them as anyone.  The men killed are always found with cards showing a figure of death throwing an arrow.  More mysterious still, the men die of arrows in the heart.  Arrows that are Native American (Mohawk, to be exact) in make.  Perhaps none of this would have interested Tom were Will not found murdered with one of those very cards in his pocket.  Now it's up to our teenaged hero and family friend Dr. Harker to track down the murderer and determine whether or not these deaths are really the work of a demon after all.<br /><br />This is the first of the Tom Marlowe Adventure series.  Subsequent novels are near identical to the form established in this book.  Therefore, if you like the way this title reads, you're bound to enjoy its sequels.  A review of \\"Death and the Arrow\\" from the British \\"Guardian\\" newspaper said of it, \\"a tightly woven plot ... lightly but vividly drawn\\".  I quote this review here because I think its wording is spot on.  Priestley doesn't mince words with this slim 161 page novella.  You want action, adventure, and a bit of historical mystery?  You got it.  Because the author and the book itself originally hail from England, it suffers a little from that perpetual and sometimes unhealthy British fascination with Native Americans.  Fortunately, for the most part the people in this book are given a fair shake.  Some readers may take issue with the ways in which they are presented, but there's certainly a lot of very careful political correctness at work.<br /><br />Though the book could be called a historical mystery, Tom doesn't really do all that much detective work per say.  Mostly this is left up to Dr. Harker, and even he is more inclined to let circumstances take him where they may rather than deduce anything brilliantly.  Tom may have more than a little Dr. Watson in him, but Dr. Harker had better work on his Sherlock Holmes impression a bit more.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the novelty of reading a kid's book set in London in a time period other than Victorian England.  There's only so much Dickensian dialogue (not to say naming) a person can take before feeling fully satiated.  The novel 18th century setting also allows for far more interesting political and historical events to play out in the background.<br /><br />No one's going to award Chris Priestley for originality, but if you've a kid who enjoys their Hardy Boys, their Nancy Drew, and their Trixie Belden then I can think of few other books that read as swiftly and enjoyably as \\"Death and the Arrow\\".  It's a fun ride and a swift to-the-point journey that avoids feeling too slapdash.hink of few other books that read as swiftly and enjoyably as \\"Death and the Arrow\\".

Linocuts.  Ask me to expound on the subject of watercolors and I'll do so for years on end.  Request my opinion on woodcuts or pen and ink drawings and I'll talk your ear firmly off.  Plead with me to offer a discourse on the wonders of collage and you'll be pleading just as heartily an hour later when I refuse to stop.  But show me a book done entirely in linocuts and you already know my response.  Mmmf.  Linocuts.<br /><br />This is hardly fair though.  Certainly linocuts, while not the most eye-poppingly fabulous illustration technique known to man, have their own particular charm.  \\"Polar Bear Night\\" proves as much.  Created through the collaboration of author Lauren Thompson (best known, until now, for bringing \\"Little Quack\\" books into the world) and artist Stephen Savage, the book tempers its potentially treacly-sweet message with some cute-but-not-overly-saccharine illustrations.  The result works.  I'll tell you right here and now that \\"Polar Bear Night\\" isn't my favorite picture book of 2004.  But it tells a sweet message and gives young young kids a good idea of what kinds of animals live on the North Pole.<br /><br />A baby polar bear cannot sleep.  Instead, she stares outside into the bright wintery moonlight with the undeniable feeling that something is out there.  Something that is calling to her.  Leaving her warm and sleeping mother's side, the polar bear cub passes a variety of different animals, all asleep and out in the open.  Then she goes to the top of a mountain of snow and waits.  All of a sudden, the night sky is filled with softly falling stars.  In the star shower the other animals wake-up and watch in amazement.  Then, when it is done, the cub is finally tired and returns home to, \\"mother bear's soft, warm fur\\".  The last image in the book is of the mother softly nuzzling her baby's head.<br /><br />I can see why people love this book.  Thompson, who until now was content to write nice but not particularly overwhelming picture books, hones her simple words into something akin to poetry.  Consider these two sentences that describe the cub as she watching the star show.  \\"The light up everything the little bear loves.  And the little bear shines bright with light too\\".  Thompson skillfully conveys an emotion children can identify with while also making the words easy one-syllable descriptors.  With this page, Thompson caught my admiration and never let it go.<br /><br />Savage is different.  I'm the first one to admit that the pictures here are, in their way, stunning.  But there's something (forgive my phrasing) cold about the book as well.  Savage places the lighting and the pacing of the illustrations in a kind of hazy dreamscape, while keeping the images here crisp, clear, and sharp.  The result is a beautiful book that will please some children, but not all.  This is not crime, of course.  It is the rare book indeed that makes every kid happy.  But for all its beauty, \\"Polar Bear Night\\" is bound to bore those children that want color and tension rather than muted tones and geometric polar animals.<br /><br />It's a great book and if you know the children that you are giving it to very very well (and know them to be dreamy types from time to time who can sit and listen to moderately paced tales) then this is the purchase for you.  If, on the other hand, you are thinking of passing this along to reluctant readers or kids with the attention spans of sparrows, think again.  It's a nice book but linocuts are not everyone's cup of tea.  It's beautiful but for some it may turn out to be a rather hard sell.icture books, hones her simple words into something akin to poetry.

This rule generally applies to all awards, I suppose in some way.  Oscar winning actors, actresses, and directors never seem to win for their best films either.  But the case seems to be even more extreme when it comes to picture books.  Let's take author/illustrator extraordinaire Uri Shulevitz as our example.  Now review your Caldecott knowledge and tell me what book earned Shulevitz a Caldecott.  If you said, \\"The Fool of the World and the Flying Ship\\", you are correct.  Now, tell me which book Shulevitz both wrote and illustrated which DESERVED the Caldecott Award (not Honor).  If you said, \\"Snow\\" then you are once more right right right.  I recently discovered this charming and thoroughly pleasing little book all on my own and I can tell you here and now that aside from the great \\"Snowy Day\\" by Ezra Jack Keats, there is no other book that so skillfully pinpoints the elation a child feels at the first real snowfall of the year.<br /><br />We're in a village.  A village where the clouds hang heavy overhead and the only words on the first page are, \\"The skies are gray. The rooftops are gray. The whole city is gray\\". The next two-page spread gives a perfect sense of anticipation.  Underneath this mono-colored set of stores and houses are the words, \\"Then......one snowflake\\".  And if you look very very carefully, there's a single spot of white against the gray swelling watercolor that is the sky.  A boy in an orange hat points out the flake with delight, his dog by his side.  His grandfather, however, doesn't think snow is possible.  Then there are two snowflakes (with a man in a hat pish-pishing the possibility).  Then there are three snowflakes and a lady with an umbrella proclaims that they'll simply melt.  And they do, it's true. \\"But as soon as one snowflake melts another takes its place\\".  And in spite of the adults and in spite of the radio and in spite of the television, it begins to snow.  The boy frolics with his dog and some imaginary friends.  And by the time the snow is done the whole city is white but the sky is a brilliant bright sunny blue hue.<br /><br />This is a book about hope.  How childish belief can overcome adult nay-sayers and jaded remarks.  Never mind that after a few months the kid will want to see anything BUT snow.  At this point in time, he's trumped the grown-ups of the world.  I especially enjoyed the parts of the book that declared that \\"snowflakes don't listen to radio, snowflakes don't watch television\\".  What snowflakes do is fall.  Shulevitz spares his words for the moments when they are most needed.  When they do come, they are brisk and to the point.  His boy and dog, on the other hand, are playful and exuberant.  This book in some ways resembles nothing so much as a Maurice Sendak story.  The frolicking child character is especially Sendakian, it now occurs to me.  Still, these illustrations are far more subtle and restrained than most other picture books.  The snowflakes, when they appear, are so tiny and insignificant that it takes a quick eye to spot them.  The watercolors are lovely muted tones and the characters (at least the adults) are people with exaggerated gravity, quickly becoming ridiculous when they find themselves caught out in an \\"unexpected\\" snowfall.<br /><br />You can tell readily if some books will be lovely deeply and dearly by children for years to come.  This is one such of a kind.  It's bound to be beloved by millions for decades and decades.  A wonderful discoveryits place\\".

151994:US	49148452	RG7MD99TSNAKT	0439784549	162568542	Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Book 6)	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Harried for Harry! Potty (a Britishism) for Potter!	Harry Potter books are very personal to me.  I sincerely believe that were it not for Harry, I wouldn't be a children's librarian today.  I first discovered him in England in 1999, just before he hit mainstream America and become a Yankee \\"phenomenon\\".  Before anyone else in the U.S. had heard of Harry, his books felt like something I couldn't imagine sharing with strangers.  I think that there are millions of people out there who feel the same way too.  When a new Harry Potter book comes out we all go out and buy it and read it as quickly as possible because we can't stand the thought that someone else in the world (aside from Ms. Rowling herself) knows what's going to happen.  Due to certain reviewers and spoilers, I had a vague idea of what the big finish of this tale was going to be.  What I could never have counted on was how exciting the ride was getting there.  Rowling's back, babies.  And her latest Harry Potter is the best since \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\".<br /><br />Like most wars on terror, the one currently being waged against not-dead-anymore-Lord-Voldemort isn't going too smoothly.  Remember Cornelius Fudge?  Well he's been sacked.  There are random deaths appearing everywhere, the Dementors have joined Voldemort, the giants are on his side, and even the werewolves are going for the evil new leader.  Harry, on the other hand, is in heaven.  After less than a month with the Dursleys he's been spirited away (by Dumbledore personally) to live with the Weasleys and enjoy himself.  He's even met the new Potions teacher at Hogwarts (Snape having finally moved up in the world to the job he's always dreamed of - Defense Against the Dark Arts).  Things might be smooth this year at Hogwarts, but Harry is quickly becoming obsessed with what Malfoy's up to.  And then Harry is given an Advanced Potions book once belonging to someone called the Half Blood Prince that offers him fabulous potion and spell-casting advice at all times.  It is undoubtedly going to be a year he never forgets.<br /><br />I'm not so mature that I didn't feel a little pleased to have figured out who the Half-Blood Prince was by clues left in \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\".  Certain kids will definitely be just as delighted as well when they figure it out.  Unlike the last two Harry books (which, no matter how much you enjoyed them, definitely dragged) \\"Half-Blood Prince\\" is tightly written and Rowling at her best.  She juggles perfectly her humor (Fred and George's gag shop is not only an inventive hit but a hilarious one as well) with some truly meaningful moments between Harry and Dumbledore.  There's even a flashback to Voldemort's mother that appears to be almost identical to a scene in \\"Oliver Twist\\".  With Voldemort in the role of Oliver.  Romance fans will finally see a little action occurring between certain characters (some you'd never suspect it of).  Best of all, however, are the down times.  Rowling is a genius at making you want to pack your bags and go to Hogwarts to be friends with Harry and his crew.  Though certain authors like to put-down Rowling for not being a \\"real\\" author, no one who pens as perfect a sense of camaraderie as she does can be called anything but a genius with her words.<br /><br />But it is dark.  Very very very dark.  Oh it doesn't seem so at first.  Then you get to the last 100 pages and there's a scene (which I shall not describe because I found it truly horrific in every sense of the word) that will leave children under the age of 10 huddled under their bedsheets whimpering.  Normally I'm a fan of listening to all the Harry Potter books on CD as read by Jim Dale.  Because of this scene, I think I'll be eschewing Dale's rendition this time.<br /><br />The book does raise more questions than it answers, true.  There are certainly tons of details out there that we need to know more about.  But I remain confident that Rowling is a wonderful enough writer to be fully up to the task.  \\"Half-Blood Prince\\" willleave you feeling as though you've been through as many trials and tribulations as Harry.  The only thing you'll be regretting by the story's end is the fact that now you've only one more book in the series to look forward to in the future.

You might wonder why I continue to read \\"Baby Duck\\" books when they have, in the past, struck me as insipid or downright dull.  But the fact of the matter is that the New York Public Library system adores Baby Duck.  They can't get enough of her.  In fact, if you go online right now and go to their \\"100 Picture Books Everyone Should Know\\", I'll bet you anything in the world that there's a Baby Duck title somewhere on the list.  And since I have sworn to read and review each and every one of the books that appear on that list, I am bound to read books like \\"Off To School, Baby Duck\\".  Now admittedly, this book is heads and tails better than \\"You're the Boss, Baby Duck\\".  It deals with the very real concerns children face when beginning school for the first time.  However, there is no denying that the book is not exactly on par with works by Rosemary Wells or Maurice Sendak.  Though a nice enough title, \\"Off To School, Baby Duck\\" is, at its heart, mildly insipid.<br /><br />Baby Duck has a problem.  A problem by the name of \\"school\\".  Finally old enough to go to Kindergarten for the very first time, Baby Duck isn't exactly pleased with the prospect.  Though her parents try to cajole her in a variety of different ways, Baby is fairly certain that school is a mighty frightening prospect.  On the day in question, she dresses slowly and drags herself with her parents to the school house.  Once outside, she meets up with Grampa.  Ever a fount of wisdom Grampa slowly shows Baby Duck that school can be fun.  She meets her new teacher, Miss Posy, who isn't mean at all.  She makes a new friend in a boy named Davy Duck.  And by the time it's time for school, Baby may still be nervous, but she knows that school can be a really fun time if she's ready for it.<br /><br />Though I've never been a huge fan of Jill Barton's illustrations, she does a particularly nice job in this book.  Barton has somehow found a way to draw an outdoor landscape that reflects that odd time of the year known as September.  In this book, the leaves on the trees are green with tinges of brown and gold.  Baby duck wears a button up sweater appropriate for late summer/early fall temperatures.  It's hard to fault Barton's pictures here.  When Baby is nervous, you have a lovely picture of her clutching Grampa's arm, half-hiding her face there in nervousness.  Of course, I've always found it mildly disturbing that all the ducks in Baby's world look identical.  They just sport different sets of clothing so that you can tell them apart.  Erg.<br /><br />And then there's that old problem with the Baby Duck books that inevitably raises its ugly head at some point in the story.  Baby Duck is forever singing songs that express her mood.  The problem is, these songs never rhyme or scan.  I'm a huge fan of Hoban's, \\"Bread and Jam For Frances\\", which also deals with a toddler singing.  The difference is, Frances's songs are great.  Baby Duck?  Not so much.  To Amy Hest I offer this plea:  How hard can it be to write a charming rhyming jingle in a picture book????  Okay, maybe we're supposed to believe that Baby Duck's songs are akin to the songs sung by children in her age range.  Songs that little kids make up that never seem to have any cohesion to them.  Well, who cares?  Doesn't Ms. Hest know that it's incredibly difficult to read a book out loud to large groups of preschoolers if you can find a rhythm with which to read them a song or verse?<br /><br />Ah well.  Perhaps I ask too much of these books.  \\"Baby Duck\\" titles are inevitably less interesting than those written by people like Kevin Henkes (if you want an alternative going to school theme, try his fabulous \\"Wemberly Worried\\") or the aforementioned Rosemary Wells.  In any case, of the Baby Duck books I've already seen, this one is better than most.

Sometimes I suspect that alphabet books must be the sustaining backbone of the world's publishing houses.  How else to describe the plethora of them that glut the market from year to year?  Does the world really need one more dinosaur alphabet book?  How about an avante garde one where all the letters are performed by members of Philobolus?  Now author Kathleen Krull, known best perhaps for her stunning \\"Lives of\\" series, gives us a musically inspired version.  She's paired with artisan Stacy Innerst, an accomplished illustrator with relatively few books under her belt to date.  Together, they bring us a goofy look at a variety of different styles, tones, and notes.  Though a little more diversity would have been a welcome addition, the book is an interesting (if somewhat confused) romp from A to Z.<br /><br />Four quotes to begin.  You've got your Nietzsche, your Charlie Parker, your Helen Keller, and your Frank Zappa.  Any picture book that finds a logical connecting thread between Nietzsche and Zappa right from the get-go has my attention.  Then we're off.  To give you a sense of the book, I'll describe the first letter's two-page spread.  A man (quite possibly famous in the world of accordionists) stretches his instrument to the words, \\"Aa is for anthem and accordion\\".  Around him pop up musical terms like \\"alto\\", \\"a cappella\\" and \\"aria\\".  A side picture done in grays is shown of Louis Armstrong.  From here on in letters are given either one or two pages full of different terms and pictures.  From Elvis to Mozart and Hildegard of Bingen to Zydeco.  In the end of the book lies a glossary of terms wherein some of the confusing pictures and words are explained (which is why I was able to tell you that Hildegard was of Bingen).<br /><br />The pictures and words are quite nice.  Both realistic and delightfully surreal.  I was much taken with a bizarre picture of two ukuleles singing in grass skirts on a sandy shore.  According to the book, these pictures were done in oils and acrylics on a surface of gessoed board and tin.  Tin!  Tin is painted on and the word \\"gessoed\\" doesn't even appear in my computer's dictionary.  I knew neither, prior to reading this.<br /><br />But let's talk diversity.  Not just of race (which is a little spotty to begin with) but also of the kinds of music shown here.  First of all, Krull's not shy about making it clear which artists she feels worthy of inclusion.  Hence, we get a lot of classic rock from people like Zappa, Elvis, and the Beatles.  In her bookflap, Krull mentions that her favorite kinds of music are, \\"classical, sound tracks, rock, and world music (especially Irish, Middle Eastern, and klezmer)\\". Be that as it may, no Middle Eastern music is portrayed here, let alone Irish.  No mention is made of rap (would she not consider it a form of music or is rhythm not musical?) and few mentions of black musicians outside of jazz or spirituals.  Tons of classical music nods, however.  Just no one Asian, Native American or even South American.<br /><br />Still, it's shockingly easy to discredit an author for what they fail to include.  What Krull has collected is well-thought out and the accompanying illustrations are pitch perfect at almost all times (with a possible exception of the mighty odd \\"W\\" page).  All in all, if you'd like to choose a musically-inclined picture book for your young 'un, this one certainly fits the bill.e.

If there's one thing that children (and childlike adults) hate, it's books with inconclusive endings.  If you're reading a story and you meet a sympathetic character who commits an atrocious crime, you undoubtedly want to know why that crime was committed.  The last thing you're going to want is to reach the end of the story and find yourself staring at the final page without any more idea why such-n-such happened as you did when you first began.  It's a remarkably gutsy move on the part of an author to create a book like, \\"Making Up Megaboy\\".  Admittedly, author Virginia Walters and illustrator Katrina Roeckelein have written a book that was a better idea in theory than it winded up being in practice.  Still, they've done their best and the story certainly catches the eye and will make for plenty of lively discussions of what the true tale really is.<br /><br />No one knows why Robbie Jones shot the old Korean man in the liquor store.  Robbie was a thirteen-year-old kid with few friends and an active fantasy life.  He and his best friend Ruben would draw comic strips of a character named \\"Megaboy\\".  Robbie had a crush on a girl named Tara in school, but his connection to Mr. Koh (the deceased) was sketchy at best.  Now however he's a thirteen-year-old with murder on his head and evidence all around him.  Why he did it, no one knows.  But everyone has an idea.  And everyone's talking.<br /><br />I guess the real danger of this book is that it sort of gives the impression that if a kid is a loner who keeps to his or her own self and likes art, they're probably a danger.  The book could even be interpreted to mean something along the lines of those-who-do-not-conform-to-society-will-ultimately-destroy-it.  Sure Robbie seems like a nice kid, but since we never know why exactly he killed Mr. Koh he's given a bit of distance from the reader.  There's also the fact that the story's essentially unbelievable.  I mean, people just don't go about killing other people for no good reason.  It's not a day-to-day reaction.  Robbie's crime is so frustrating to readers partly because it's so senseless.  And not senseless in the sense that it's a waste of a young life.  Senseless because from what we know of Robbie (and from the scant 64 some pages here, that ain't much) he's not the type that would do this crime.  Also, if a thirteen-year-old kills someone, goes to jail, and refuses to talk about it and seems to be in shock.... Well what better basis for an insanity plea could you want?<br /><br />I'm talking about all the problems with the book, but there are good things in it as well.  The original format taking all sides and showing the crime after the fact is good.  Ditto the characters you get to know.  Placing much of her skill in throwaway lines, Walter enables characters like Tara (the girl Robbie had a crush on) to deliver nasty cutting thoughts on things like selling a picture Robbie once gave her for a lot of money now that he's infamous.<br /><br />In the end, however, \\"Making Up Megaboy\\" doesn't know what it wants to be.  Obviously this book is trying, and not quite succeeding, to be akin to Walter Dean Myers', \\"Monster\\".  Of the two, \\"Monster\\" is a far stronger book.  \\"Megaboy\\" is just too short to make up for its one-of-a-kind ending.  It's certainly possible to write a book in which a crime remains a mystery up and until the end.  But to do so the author needs to immerse the reader fully in that criminal's head.  We never see anything that Robbie's actually thinking, with the possible exception of a \\"Megaboy\\" script thrown in at the end of the tale.  We don't know how Robbie felt about his parents or his friends or his school.  Just a single glimpse into his head would've salvaged a promising idea.  Walter fails in this respect.

Just off the top of your head, name me as many children's fantasy books starring African-Americans as you can come up with.  \\"The Wizard of Earthsea\\" doesn't count.  Go!  How'd you do?  Come up with many?  My bet is that if you were able to think of anything it was either a book by Virginia Hamilton or one of the five million books out there in which a contemporary black character is taken back in time to the era of slaves/Jim Crow.  Maybe you also came up with \\"The Ear, the Eye, and the Arm\\", but that's more sci-fi anyway.  This is unacceptable.  Fantasy is a huge genre of children's fiction.  How hard could it be to write a couple good books with black characters?  Whatever the case may be, thank God for Andre Norton.  A fabulous fantasy/sci-fi author who flourished in the 1970s, Norton's legacy is all but lost in libraries today.  Once in a while, however, a lucky child or adult stumbles on a Norton title, like \\"Lavender-Green Magic\\" and is rewarded with a richly textured tale of good vs. evil.  Containing African-American child heroes, I am of the opinion that this author deserves a little re-publication immediately.<br /><br />The year is 1970 and Holly Wade has never felt worse in her life.  Her father's been reported MIA in Vietnam, she and her siblings are being shipped off to live with their grandparents in the country, and the bus she's riding right now is making her nauseous.  With a bad mood hanging over her head already, Holly tries not to enjoy anything that occurs to her once the family arrives at Dimsdale where her grandparents live.  Still, it's hard not to find the junkyard her family runs pretty cool.  Everyone's nice to the Wades and there are even mysterious stories about a witch who cursed the Dimsdale property long ago.  It isn't until Holly discovery a mysterious scented pillow, however, that she and her siblings get caught up in a time traveling mystery where magic and witchery play a very big part.<br /><br />Norton plays hard and fast with more than one childhood love in this book.  Hedge mazes are a big part of the plot and they are, first and foremost, very cool.  But a book that has hedge mazes AND a junkyard?  Double trouble.  The book handles racism in an interesting manner, with Holly expecting it at every turn and never finding what she fears.  Nothing in this book ever strikes the reader as dated either.  Quite frankly, the only reason you might think that this book wasn't written today are the brief references to Vietnam and Korea.  Otherwise it feels particularly savvy and up-to-date.<br /><br />But what I particularly liked about the book were the characters.  Holly makes for a very interesting heroine since you spend half the book wishing she'd stop being such a jerk.  When she allies herself with a particularly nasty witch of the past, the reader has the painful task of watching as Holly makes a bad situation for herself even worse.

The grandparents are wonderful people to  know and the book is filled with homey descriptions of their life and day-to-day jobs.

The book may be a 70s period piece, but these characters could've stepped out of any time.  It's a great pity that \\"Lavender-Green Magic\\" isn't better known today.

First of all, I want to say that due to the way \\"The Dark Ground\\" was written, it's almost impossible to write a review of it without giving away those major mysterious plot points that are slowly revealed by the author throughout the reading of the text.  Therefore, I must be a good little reviewer and warn you right here and now that my review contains many many spoilers about this book.  If you want to read this wonderfully mysterious and atmospheric tale with any sense of wonder, stop reading this review once this paragraph ends.  I'll sum up the important information right here for your convenience:  This is a fun first book in a series.  It's fast-paced, full of action, and a bit gory for younger kids.  You'll enjoy finding out what happens to its hero and the ending leaves you wanting more.  There!  Now go away unless you want to be completely clued into some of the deeper innerworkings of this marvelous British import.<br /><br />It's just your typical airplane ride.  One minute Robert's in the bathroom of a plane, looking in the mirror, and seeing a tiny man in the black part of his iris.  The next, he's naked and alone in a huge forest with no sense of where he is and no one he knows near him.  Using his wits Robert must fend for himself, finding food, makeshift clothing, and a shelter of some sort.  As he grows better acquainted with his surroundings, the boy realizes that there are other people living near him and he must do everything he can to get their attention and find out what exactly has happened to him.<br /><br />In many ways this book is just a slightly more fantastical version of Gary Paulsen's, \\"Hatchet\\".  The sense of survival against a cruel world (not to mention the gigantic hungry creatures within it) and sense of one man against the universe is prevalent throughout the text.  What really pulls the story together though is Cross's ability to convey the horrific and the impossible in a believable way.  Robert realizes what's happened to him only after confronting the facts and realizing that, however impossible they may seem, they must be true.  You see, Robert has been shrunken.  He's tiny.  So are the other people he meets.  So when he sets off for his old home to recover his old life, the trek is long and arduous.  The book's like \\"The Borrowers\\" but much darker.  What's really amazing about Cross's writing is that she manages to make an essentially silly idea (boy-gets-shrunk) into something frightening and disturbing.<br /><br />Of course there are some problems.  For one thing, Cross is a great writer but she is simply awful at humor.  There's really not a single funny line or lighthearted jab anywhere to be found in this tome.  Robert's in a serious situation and it remains serious continually.  This can be a bit wearying after 200 pages or so.  There's also a lot of howling, pain, and people confronting big ideas and not being able to reconcile themselves to them.  These characters are constantly shying away from painful thoughts.  It gets more than a little repetitive over time.  Also, though the other people don't save Robert right off the bat because they want him to prove himself, he never blames them for it.  Never even mentions it to them (though he's almost killed several times as a result).  Seems odd.  Finally, none of the characters ever wear shoes... or seem to want to.  Huh?<br /><br />In any case, this is still a wonderful story that's written well but could have stood a little comic relief and less howls of agony.  Definitely a title for older readers who aren't afraid of a little vomit, bloodshed, death, and despair.  The feel good book of the year it's not.

And now I have a new praise to add, with the reading of the delightful \\"Lucinda's Secret\\".  I can say that author Holly Black not only knows her fairies but also knows her fairy lore.  In this latest installment in the popular series, Black incorporates Christina Rossetti's \\"Goblin Market\\" alongside a fast-paced story of three children battling the fairy world.  At the heart of these tales, however, is the story of Jared's struggle against his own violent tendencies and the ways in which he cares for his siblings.<br /><br />Jared still refuses to give up Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide to the Fantastical World Around You.  This in spite of the fact that he and his siblings were recently attacked by goblins and his twin brother Simon was nearly roasted over a spit.  Mallory and Simon are certain that just giving up the book  would solve all their problems, but Jared's not so sure.  To answer these questions the children (finally) go to visit their Great-Aunt Lucinda, currently living in a home for the mentally ill.  Lucinda tells them the dangers of living in their house as well as the fact that the book is a danger.  Unfortunately for them, Thimbletack the house brownie/boggart has stolen the book himself and it quickly becomes clear that after an encounter with a phooka and some elves that EVERYBODY wants what the children can no longer find.<br /><br />The book takes a turn for the darker (though admittedly the eaten pet cat in the last book was a bit bleak) when Lucinda's fate is fully known.  Having made the mistake of eating fairy food (a bit of a no-no no matter what book you're reading) she is forced to eat only fairy food for the rest of her life.  Moreover, she describes a somewhat gruesome way in which the goblins attempted to find the location of the book through her.  Otherwise, the story's the same interesting and fully entrancing tale as its predecessors.  More creatures and characters have appeared and we finally learn the name of the villain behind all of this: Mulgrath.  Throw in the possibility that Arthur Spiderwick may still be alive somewhere and you've got yourself one heckuva engrossing tale in a mere 108 pages.<br /><br />In many ways, this is perhaps my favorite installment of the \\"Spiderwick\\" series thus far.

And when 3:30 rolls around, the librarian who's supposed to be doing the reading (that would be me) inevitably starts searching the shelves for some sure-fire storytime hits.  It isn't easy.  You have to gauge how old your audience is going to be, sight unseen, and come up with a variety of different reading levels just in case.  You need books that sound good on the tongue, are interesting, sport amusing pictures, and yet have just enough creativity to enliven a half-hour of tale telling.  With all this in mind, thank God for \\"Abiyoyo\\".  It fulfills a storyteller's every need and keeps 'em coming back for more.  Little wonder it's as popular as it is.<br /><br />In a town populated by people of every race, persuasion, and creed, a boy and his father live.  They're not the most popular people in town.  The boy plucks his ukelele everywhere to the distraction of his neighbors and his father, a yuckster, likes to make things disappear for no good reason.  Unsurprisingly, they're chucked out of town when the boy's pa makes one thing too many go \\"zoop!\\".  On the edge of town one day, they spot a fearsome sight.  A giant by the name of Abiyoyo has appeared and he has a ravenous appetite for sheep, cows, and people.  Fortunately, the boy and the father have a plan and it isn't long before their ukelele and magic wand have some very practical uses indeed.<br /><br />Now I know this book is called a \\"storysong\\" and that it certainly couldn't hurt to sing it aloud during the reading, but I tell you here and now that a musical ear is not a requirement for this tale.  Admittedly, I'd recommend that you purchase a version of this book that comes with a recording by Pete Seeger.  Obviously.  But if you're reading it on your own to a large group of dumb-struck five-year-olds, just read the song \\"Abiyoyo\\" that appears in this book with a whole lot of verve and pep.  The story is relatively short (it takes less than 5 minutes to read it) but the words are catchy with plenty of \\"zoops\\", \\"clinks\\" \\"clunks\\" and \\"clonks\\" to jangle with the ear.<br /><br />The illustrations are a source of contention.  Why this is, I do not know.  Illustrator Michael Hays (also responsible for Mildred D. Taylor's, \\"Gold Cadillac\\") has chosen to place this tale in a particularly fanciful village.  The people here are of all kinds of races and identities.  This is the world as a village in a particularly straightforward way.  Abiyoyo himself, when he appears, is a suitable threat.  Initially silhouetted against a \\"blood red\\" sky, he looks like nothing so much as an escapee from a Cubism painting.  All sharp shiny surfaces, of which there are too many.<br /><br />Few kids can resist hearing a tale of magic, giants, and a clever child hero.  \\"Abiyoyo\\" shall undoubtedly remain a staple of the storytelling community for years and years to come as well.

And I cannot tell you how many times I've sat listening to the gentle strains of The Pirates of Penzance while pondering, \\"This is good.  I wonder how much better it would be if performed by dogs?\\".  Well now I have my answer.  \\"Seadogs\\" is perhaps one of the quirkiest ideas to come out of the fine fine publishing house of Atheneum.  Part comic strip caper, part rousing piratical tale, and part musical revue the book works as well as it does simply because its disparate elements fit together perfectly.  Whether you've a kid who just likes their picture books good and cartoony or a child with an ear for bouncy trouncy rhythms, the combined artistry of author Lisa Wheeler and illustrator Mark Siegel is best put in a single word: Harmony.<br /><br />A small female pup attends a revue of a show called \\"Seadogs\\" with her mother.  The time period appears to be mid-Victorian and behind scenes we see the actors and actresses getting reading.  When the curtain lifts we are plunged into a whole new world of dogs and ships and sea.  An old seadog goes into his favorite pub and mourns the fact that he can no longer go to the ocean he loves.  Brave beagle and her companion, a timid but sweet dachshund, cannot cheer him until he vows to buy a seaworthy vessel and take them with him on \\"one last sail\\".  Off the three go to find adventure on the high seas.  All goes well until the ship is plundered by the fearsome Jacques FiFi (the terrier of the sea) who leaves behind a treasure map.  With a stowaway pup and a map to guide them adventure, capture, and even more adventure rounds out this solid storytime fare.<br /><br />The book is innately comic, but I was delighted to find some moments of real tenderness as well.  When the seadogs find a pup hidden in a coil of rope, the captain adopts the wayward hound and their songs together are full of tenderness.  Mind you, there are plenty of dog puns to pore through here.  Jacques Fifi commands a crew known as the Mongrel Hoard.  There are framed prints of authors named \\"Growbert\\" and \\"Sulllibone\\".  You get the picture.  But the songs are catchy, the illustrations livelly and amusing, and the book a real joy to go through.  I once had the pleasure of sharing an elevator with illustrator Mark Siegel (unbeknownst to him) and I can ascertain that though this may be his first book for children, I am certain it will not be his last.<br /><br />If I have any problems with this book, it's that there wasn't a cd of these songs included.  With picture books like \\"Science Verse\\", such cds are givens.  Not so here.  Looks like audiences will have to come up with their own tunes if they want to share in the fun.  Still, it's a great little title and perfect reading material for a dark and rainy night.u, there are plenty of dog puns to pore through here.

Ahem.  Dear Ms. Fleming - please forgive me for confusing you, each and every time I see a picture book of yours, with fellow children's author Lois Ehlert.  I know that you and Ms. Ehlert may have much in common (your audience, your colors, etc.) but that does not mean that I should assume that you write with the same doleful tone as she has utlized in her many works.  In fact, your books are almost always surprisingly funny (a fact I am repeatedly shocked by again and again and again).  I understand that this is entirely my own fault but I sincerely hope that as time goes on, I will outgrow this childish (ho ho!) response to your books and recognize you immediately as the truly enjoyable author that you really are.  Sincerely - a most loyal if absentminded fan.<br /><br />That said, let me tell you a little something about Ms. Fleming's remarkable \\"Mama Cat Has Three Kittens\\".  As you probably could tell from the preceding paragraph, I always read a Fleming book with much sighing and moaning.  Then, after finishing it, it's all I can do to prevent myself from purchasing a copy for every friend I know who MIGHT one day have children.  This book is no exception.  Initially simple, the book is about a large black and white cat and her three adorable kittens, Fluffy, Skinny, and ... Boris.  Boris is, first of all, a great name for a cat.  Especially an orange terminally sleepy cat.  As we read, Mama Cat will do something, like sharpen her claws or wash her paws, and Fluffy and Skinny will do the same.  Boris?  He naps.  The day continues like this (punctuated with the phrase, \\"Boris naps\\") until at last Mama Cat and two of her kittens are ready for a little shut-eye themselves.  With adorable care, Boris then wakes, stretches, yawns, washes, and finally pounces directly onto his mother.  Then, in an image of Boris stretched out on his mother's back (as she and his two siblings shoot him quizzical glances), \\"Boris naps\\".  The end.<br /><br />The unexpected joke at the end of the book is startling to those parents who weren't expecting too read a picture book with any wit in it.  But if Denis Fleming is guilty of anything, she's guilty of always making her books surprisingly amusing.  Once again, the book is using her customary and very original colored cotton pulp and stencil illustration technique.  The result is a blindingly beautiful mix of colors and images.  As with her magnificent \\"Lunch\\" and \\"Barnyard Banter\\" (which, if you haven't seen them, you must immediately rush out and purchase pronto) Fleming isn't afraid of mixing a couple primaries together to get her readers' attention.  Unlike other books I've seen of hers, though, \\"Mama Cat\\" is exceptional because as an artist Fleming obviously knows her cats.  You get the distinct feeling from this book that she's studied their muscle structure to some extent.  Whether the cats are stretching, sharpening their claws with curved backs, or leaping in some way, these felines ring true.  For cat lovers, this book is a must-own.<br /><br />I concede that I'll eventually have to go out and read every single Denise Fleming book available, if only so that I'm not shocked by how much I like them when I stumble on 'em.  Until then, I'll keep \\"Mama Cat Has Three Kittens\\" close to my heart.  A sweet tale with excellent repetition, colorful motifs, and a funny conclusion.

Usually I prefer them to be post-apocalyptic, but once in the while I cave in and read a bit of nice sci-fi kiddie lit involving robots.  It calms my nerves.  \\"Eager\\" is my latest read, and while it's nothing we haven't seen before, it has a sweet edge to it.  It its worst it feels like a novelization of \\"Millennium Man\\".  Fortunately, this is rare.  By and large, new British author Helen Fox has penned a particularly nice book involving floating spheres, rubberized limbs, and tomato soup breakfasts.<br /><br />The Bell family has a problem.  For years and years they've been served by their faithful old robot, Grumps.  Grumps isn't a particularly fancy model, but he gets the job done.  Lately, however, the old robot's timer has been off.  He has a great deal of difficulty separating night from day and often serves the wrong meal at the wrong time.  The family decides it would be best to get another robot to help Grumps, and their prayers are answered by an entirely new (if somewhat unattractive) prototype named Eager.  Eager is the first robot to learn like a human, a fact that sometimes serves him well and sometimes ill.  The family has mixed feelings towards their new acquisition.  On the one hand, son Gavin grows fond of the little guy quite quickly.  On the other hand, daughter Fleur (a popular name in children's literature these days) would much prefer one of those expensive and sleek BDC4s on the market.  Of course, something particularly strange is happening to the BDC4s.  And as Gavin, Fleur, and Eager investigate, their situation grows more and more perilous.<br /><br />The book commits the particularly heinous crime (perpetuated by more children's books than I can name) of creating its own futuristic slang.  Particularly bad futuristic slang, no less.  Instead of \\"cool\\" people say \\"euphoric\\".  When someone is being a doofus they are (I kid you not) put down with that most intimidating of insults, \\"You moonrock\\".  For a book that acts so intelligently on so many topics, the use of the term \\"moonrock\\" (better fitted to an episode of \\"The Jetsons\\" than a contemporary kids' book) jars horrendously.  For better future jargon, try reading \\"Feed\\" by M.T. Anderson instead.  Unlike \\"Eager\\", \\"Feed\\" is very concerned with how humanity can lose its freedom over time.  \\"Eager\\" touches on this idea briefly, but doesn't really explore it any further than a sentence here and there.<br /><br />As you read this book you'll undoubtedly see characters and scenes from other sources flash before your eyes.  Grumps resembles nothing so much as a slightly cheerier version of Marvin the android from \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\".  There are intimations of Bradbury and (more directly) Asimov on every other page.  The whole concept of a robot being introduced to a family and the machines in that family appeared first in one of the great Diana Wynne Jones's short stories (now found in her wonderful collection entitled \\"Unexpected Magic\\").  And then, when it comes to robots being imbued with human memories and questioning their own freedoms there's the best of all go-to robot sources, \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" by Philip K. Dick (better known to cinephiles as \\"Blade Runner\\").  So while \\"Eager\\" is quite a readable book, it isn't going to win any points for originality.<br /><br />Fortunately, kids will love the book.  What's not to adore about the idea of robots palling around with children?  Most of the loose ends of this tale are cleaned up by the end though not all, sadly.  For example, several attempts are made on Eager's life without there being any concrete explanation of who ordered these attacks and to what end.  Aside from this detail, however, Fox is very good at bringing together plot points that could easily have remained forgotten by the end.  Some adults reading this book will also get a kick over Eager's choice of personal philosopher.<br /><br/>Admittedly, it's very difficult to think of good robot stories for kids right off the top of your head.  Teen tales?  Piece of cake.  Adult stories?  You could fill a library with them.  But for kids it's different.  That's why it's so nice to find a book like \\"Eager\\".  It's not going to knock you over with its prose or philosophical insights, but it's a fun little title with a nifty plot and plenty of action.her. <br />  <br />Admittedly, it's very difficult to think of good robot stories for kids right off the top of your head.

168890:US	49148452	R1MNAMEJPYLUWQ	076361047X	491720065	A Long Way	Books	3	1	1	N	N	A single box for fun	As a general rule of thumb, it's usually a good idea not to confuse both your adult and child audiences when creating a picture book.  Now I came into this title a huge fan of illustrator Tricia Tusa.  If you'd like your little preschooler's mind to be blown for a minute or two, check out her wacky and wonderful, \\"How To Make a Night\\".  A whiz-bang concoction of craziness and gleeful insanity, the book works brilliantly.  Ironically, it is those very qualities that make her previous creation, \\"A Long Way\\", as much of a bust as it is.  Taking the cute idea of a kid making various modes of transportation out of a simple cardboard box, the book is basically a nice idea that falls flat.<br /><br />One day a package arrives at the home a girl and her mother.  After opening the large cardboard box that's arrived and wrapping the item inside, the mother acquiesces to her daughter's request that she deliver the present to her grandmother's house.  With a little imagination, the box becomes a car, then (with some nips and tucks) a boat, then (and here the imagination really does soar), and airplane, and finally (in a move that belies the author's metropolitan sensibilities) a subway.  At long last our heroine gives her Grandma her beautiful new present: a watering can.<br /><br />The reason a lot of this doesn't work is partially because the viewer has a hard time figuring out (on an initial reading) whether or not the narrator of this story is serious when she says that her Grandma's house is \\"a long way\\".  Unless you've skipped to the end already, you might feel that such a trip really would involve a vehicle of some sort.  Also, due to the layout of the book, you can't always tell why the girl featured is cutting or shaping or generally changing the box in the way that she is.  The words, provided by normally older reader author Katherine Ayres, are stilted and fitful.  For all the charm of the pictures (and they are very charming indeed) the tone of the book falls flat.

After all, Hunter is perhaps best remembered for books about Irish creatures of the deep.  \\"A Stranger\\" is about selkies and \\"The Mermaid Summer\\" concentrates on.. you know.  That's part of the reason that \\"A Sound of Chariots\\" remains as amazing as it is.  The book is probably the best fictional work written for kids and teens to talk about death, its meaning, and what lies beyond.  There are some child readers out there who consider deep philosophical meanings and are turned onto the poetic undercurrents of everyday life.  This book was written for them.<br /><br />Bridie McShane's father is not your typical dad.  He's more likely to scream, \\"Christ was a revolutionary!\\" at the top of his lungs than idly stand by while the rich of Scotland lord their money over the poor.  And that suits Bridie to a tea.  She loves her father, heart and soul.  Unlike her three older sisters (the Others, as she calls them) Bridie and her little brother William are her father's special kids.  From her dad, Bridie learns pride, honor, and truth.  It's all the worse for her then when her dad dies of a longstanding illness without warning.  Suddenly, nothing's the same.  Bridie finds herself consumed by violent disgusting nightmares involving decapitation and death.  Her mother, overcome by grief, is unable to help her children, being in no position to even help herself.  After her father's death, Bridie becomes enamored of a line from Marvell's, \\"To His Coy Mistress\\", in which the poet writes, \\"But at my back I always hear, Time's winged chariot hurrying near\\".  Bridie is a poet through and through and she constantly is trying to find a way to escape death and its winged chariot.  With the help of ministers, teachers, and people who once knew her father, Bridie is able to piece together what it means to grow up, die, and live.<br /><br />Heavy duty stuff.  It's not every book for kids that talks about death as deeply and meaningfully as this one.  Don't get me wrong, though.  This is probably not the best text to hand a child who's lost someone near and dear to them recently.  It may not even be a book to hand to a child.  There's a maturity to this text that will undoubtedly sail high over the heads of your average consumer kid.  Hunter cuts her heroine zero slack in this book, and she's not afraid to bandy about one-hundred dollar words when simple ones could've done just as well.  This is a complex book full of complex ideas.  Ideas that your everyday fifth grader may not appreciate.  But there are some kids out there that are like Bridie McShane.  Kids who see more than adults suspect.  Kids that have had to deal with tragedy early in their lives and want to know... heck... the meaning of life!  For these young philosophers, these pint-sized clerics, this book is ideal.  It questions religion, standard practices for living, and even our day-to-day lives.  Bridie is a thoughtful, intelligent, and ultimately enjoyable soul to follow.  And for those amongst you who like a little socialism in your kiddie lit, \\"A Sound of Chariot\\" has Marxism in spades.<br /><br />It's probably one of the best books for children ever written and it isn't even in print anymore.  Still, as long as reading lists exist and libraries continue to hold on to out-of-print titles, \\"A Sound of Chariots\\" may reach those kids who really need it.

171970:US	49148452	R18XDC0RR36NBK	1932425128	102464952	Fortune's Bones: The Manumission Requiem (Coretta Scott King Author Honor Books)	Books	5	12	12	N	N	Seeking one's Fortune	There are as many ways of honoring the long forgotten as there are ways of mucking that honor up.  I came to \\"Fortune's Bones\\" with just a bit of trepidation, I admit.  Though I knew author Marilyn Nelson had created this book to honor a man long dead in the best way she knew how, I was still recovering from a similar, and foul, title called, \\"Journey To the Bottomless Pit\\" which also came out in 2004.  In both books, a man who was a slave during his lifetime is honored with a children's book of fiction.  In \\"Journey\\", the book was a simplistic version of a complicated man's life.  I prayed that \\"Fortune's Bones\\" would not be the same.  Those prayers were answered tenfold.  Marilyn Nelson tells the story of Fortune in a manner respectful of his life, then accompanies this retelling with a requiem written in his honor.  Though I would have enjoyed further factual information on the topic, this is a worthy addition to any poetry collection or non-fiction collection, for children, teens, or grown adults, anywhere.<br /><br />There once was a man named Fortune.  Born a slave in the 1700s, he and his wife and his children all belonged to a Dr. Preserved Porter.  Later tests on Fortune's bones show that his life was not an easy one.  His back was once broken and though he had a healthy skeleton, he died at the age of 60.  When he did, Dr. Porter took Fortune's death as an opportunity to study human anatomy.  He removed Fortune's skeleton, tapped the bones, and made himself a complete human skeleton.  Every bone was carefully marked and studied by Porter and his ancestors.  Years later, Fortune's name was lost and the skeleton was mislabeled \\"Larry\\" and given to the Matttatuck Museum.  In the 1990s historians did research on it and found Fortune's true name once again.  Now the only question that remains is what to do with Fortune's bones.  Do we bury them and put him to rest at long last, or do we learn more from them about 1700s slaves and slavery?  The question remains unanswered, but author Marilyn Nelson has done what she can.  In this book she writes a requiem in Fortune's memory.  Filled with free verse poetry, a Kyrie of the Bones, and a Sanctus at the end, \\"Fortune's Bones\\" is a text of respect.<br /><br />One of the many things I loved about this book was the fact that as an author/poet, Nelson tells us why she wrote what she did.  One poem is entitled, \\"Not My Bones\\", in which Fortune states clearly, \\"I am not my body\\", to anyone who cares to listen.  This phrase comes from the Vietnamese Buddhist leader Thich Nhat Hahn, a fact that could well have gone uncredited by a less careful author.  Each poem in this book is accompanied by factual information pertaining to Fortune's story, along with photographs, papers, tapestries, maps, and other important documents of the period.  As a whole these poems speak beautifully together, forming a single Requiem.  I especially liked \\"Dinah's Lament\\" in which Fortune's wife speaks of the cruel injustice of being forced to dust the bones that once would, \\"hold me when I cried; to dust where his soft lips were, and his chest what curved its warm against my back at night\\".  Nelson, the accomplished voice behind her other great book, \\"Carver: A Life In Poems\\", is at her best here.<br /><br />Admittedly, there were aspects of this book left unspoken that I (and I'm sure others) would have liked to have heard more about.  The book is a Requiem and doesn't dwell on the fascinating process scientists took to discover Fortune again.  There's a small series of three pictures on one page that shows three stages of facial reconstruction of Fortune, taken from his bones.  That's something that would have made for a fascinating story in and of itself.  Or how did the researchers and historians eventually discover who Fortune really was?  Who did they talk to?  What did they read?  Sadly, such information will have to wait for another book.  It's not answered here.<br /><br />\\"Fortune's Bones\\", will obviously be snatched up by any child and/or teen assigned to read a book of poems since it's a mere 32 pages altogether.  This is a great good thing.  In spite of its scant length, this is a title that will teach a lot of information to a lot of kids in a wonderfully stirring way.  The poems are mindful of the past and give the greatest of respect to a man of whom we know so little.

Fans of the \\"Tripod\\" books are divided as to whether or not this was a good idea.  Some people claim that the three books are perfect in and of themselves and that this prequel was a bad idea poorly executed.  Others state that this is a well-written book that definitively clarifies how the tripods got a hold on the world in the way that they did.  And still others, like myself, think that the books are pretty silly to begin with, but they're fun reading and a prequel like this one isn't going to change what was already out there.  Nuff said.<br /><br />In this book we meet our hero Laurie (who, I should tell you right now, is a boy) and his best friend Andy.  While participating in a wilderness trek, the two come across a startling scene.  It happens in the middle of the night as they camp out in an abandoned shed.  From over the horizon they spot a huge three legged machine, picking its way carefully along the landscape.  To their horror, the machine casually plucks up an escaping farmer, and destroys the man's house with a few well-aimed bashes.  In no time the army is called, and when attempts at a peaceful reconciliation are dropped, they destroy the tripod forthwith.  Laurie and Andy return home to their families and all seems to go back to normal.  Of course, there is that weird tv show that came out after the Tripod disaster called the Trippy show.  It's your usual fast-paced tripod-based entertainment with catchy music.  Laurie's half-sister is obsessed with it, and she's not alone.  Suddenly people all over the world are watching the show and becoming mindless pawns.  So when more tripods land on Earth once again, suddenly there are people everywhere waiting to greet them.  The world is in serious danger, and there's not much Laurie can do to stop the onslaught.<br /><br />The book's kind of a zombie film put on paper.  At one point, people who've already been hypnotized by the program start wearing silver metal caps that prove their allegiance.  They also start \\"capping\\" their unwilling fellows, thereby taking away their free will and making them slaves of the Tripods.  In such a situation, your nearest and dearest could suddenly turn into your enemy without your ever knowing it.  Apart from the obvious zombie-like quality of the story (and Christopher is to be commended for his abilities at making a good child-friendly horror tale) the book also reminded me a bit of the first three movies in the Star Wars series.  You go into this book knowing full well that, in the end, the Tripods are going to win.  So how do you end it on a happy note?  Keeping this in mind, again John Christopher has adeptly given us a book that ends in a hopeful mind set.  It makes for a fascinating read.<br /><br />My personal problem with the series has always been that there aren't much in the way of women in the books.  I was delighted for the first 25 pages of this tale to learn that the narrator of the book was named Laurie.... and then I found out that Laurie was a boy.  Doggone it.  The women that remain here are pretty annoying as well.  There's Martha, Laurie's grandmother who favors her granddaughter, henpecks her son, and is seen in a mostly negative light.  Ilse, Laurie's step-mother, is fine but vapid.  And Angela is seen as a spoiled little brat who only comes into her own when the family vacates their home.  It's funny, but at the end of the book Laurie makes a statement that girls are more likely to join his family's rebel resistance than boys and then promptly has his head almost bitten off by an angry Angela.  This is the only moment that Christopher clearly shows his sexist hand.  I looked at the motley crew of men and women who are left free at the end of the book and had to wonder where all the girls went in the future books.  After all, the free people living in the White Mountains in subsequent novels were all men.  Ugh.<br /><br />Personally, I think this book is a much better read if you pick it up after the first three tales in the series.  Though it contains the same outdated views of women as its predecessors, \\"When the Tripods Came\\" is still a worthy addition to an already captivating series.l, the free people living in the White Mountains in subsequent novels were all men.

The idea of making a readable children's book out of something so bleak and depressing as the Irish Potato Famine.  Yet as an author, Giff has never shied away from difficult subjects.  Whether you're following the trials of a 1870 German immigrant to Brooklyn in \\"The House of Tailors\\", or a 1940's Hungarian escapee in \\"Lily's Crossing\\", Giff has become one of those go-to historical fiction writers.  With an emphasis on immigration, emigration, and forced transplantation, her books strain to find a balance between absolute historical accuracy and something your ten-year-old would actually (willingly) pick up on their own.  Personally, when I was ten years of age I wouldn't have picked up \\"Nory Ryan's Song\\" for all the gold in King Solomon's mines.  For those children that have strong stomachs and even stronger nerves, however, the book is a distinctly well-written explanation of why many of us in America sport Irish-American heritage.<br /><br />Yeah, Nory's got a pretty nice life.  True, her mother's dead and her father's away at sea to fish and pay the family's bills.  Still, she has her two older sisters, her grandfather, her little brother Patch, and her best friend Sean to keep her company.  And then one day she detects an odd smell in the air.... And even odder screams of panic from over the hills.  The smell, as it turns out, is that of potatoes dying of a particularly nasty blight.  The screams are the people who realize that death is staring them in the face.  Before she knows it, Nory's potato patch is infested as well and the family is left with zero food to get by on.  The English lord, Cunningham, who owns the land isn't about to show any mercy to his Irish tenants, and people begin to grow more and more desperate as he takes their lifestock for rent.  In the end, Nory must decide what's most important to her as she takes amazing risks to find a way to keep the people she loves alive.<br /><br />In writing this tale, Giff fast-forwards the tragedy a bit more than is strictly necessary.  For example, the residents of Nory's village discover the potato blight one day and exactly two days later literally everybody's starving.  Surely they weren't eating the underripe potatoes until now.  It seems an odd way to write the book.  Of course there's no faulting the language.  Giff knows how to write something gripping and more than a little compelling.  She parallels Nory's desperation with the hope that her father will, soon, return with money for food.  Still, there are some moments in the book where it gets so downright depressing that it's all the reader can do to keep slogging on.  For some kids, of course, this is a bonus.  And certainly it would have been a far greater crime if Giff had played off the entire tragedy in a happy-go-lightly manner.  All I'm saying is that this book, rather than being required reading for EVERY child in a certain grade, should only be given to kids who already enjoy historical fiction, tragedy, and a strong female narrator.<br /><br />It's difficult to fault this novel.  Giff knows from whence she writes and nobody in her field does a better job of describing degradation.  No one.  I don't see this book as the most pleasurable reading out there, but it's undoubtedly one of the best written.

The nice thing about \\"The Spiderwick Chronicles\\" is how quickly your average child reader gobbles them up.  Though small, they pack a wild punch and line their pages with enough plot and action to fill books three times their size.  The first book in the series was good, but the second finally gives the kiddie folks what they've been yearning for; fairies in the flesh.  Using a bit of ingenuity on old forms, \\"The Seeing Stone\\" is a welcome companion to \\"The Field Guide\\".  Fun reading.<br /><br />Things are still not going too well for poor Jared.  Just as with his last school, he's not getting along with the kids and, after his first day no less, he's been suspended.  Living in fear that his mother will discover this fact, Jared shrugs off his twin brother, Simon, who's desperately searching for their pet cat.  It's only when he speaks with the family house brownie, Thimbletack, that he realizes that his brother may be in serious danger.  Goblins are afoot, and with older sister Mallory's sword fighting skills and a remarkable device that allows Jared to see faeries hitherto invisible to the human eye, the two set off to find their kidnapped brother and bring him back home safe and sound.<br /><br />There's an old saying that says that if you see a gun in the first act of a play, it's bound to reappear by the third.  Similarly, if you see a girl wielding a sword in the first book of a five part series, that sword is bound to reappear by at least the second book.  So when you come across the chapter heading, \\"In which Mallory Finally Gets to Put Her Rapier to Good Use\\", you sense that the author is putting a bit of tongue into her cheek.  Black comes up with some particularly nasty details in this book (like the fact that goblins are born without teeth and so fill their mouths with broken glass, animals teeth, etc. to make up for the lack) so it's certainly going to freak out some child somewhere.  I doubt that anyone's going to enjoy the fate of the family cat either.  Still, she keeps the tension high and the drama keen.  DiTerlizzi's accompanying illustrations are, as always, rather nice but this time he's added a particularly interesting detail.  Midway through the book the reader finds a yellowed piece of newsprint, very realistic, talking of the disappearance of a boy named Theodore Spiderwick.  This is the first real similarity I've seen to the works of Lemony Snicket, most notably, \\"The Unauthorized Autobiography\\".  It's a nice touch, though.<br /><br />Altogether, a fine follow-up in an enjoyable series.  Some might say that you must read the first book before this one.  This is not the case.  Book two contains no information that a halfway bright child wouldn't pick up on instantaneously.  Though it's always more enjoyable to follow a series from start to finish, you needn't feel obligated.  Recommended as a good companion to the first.family cat either.

Is there anything worse than a review or a blurb that describes a product as  *blank* meets *blank*?  How simplistic!  How callous!  That said, the first words that popped into my head after reading the first book in the ever-popular series \\"The Secrets of Droon\\" was Harry Potter meets The Magic Tree House.  Which probably was exactly what author Tony Abbott was going for.  This early chapter book (originally published in 1999) looks like a slightly older and more mature version of those saccharine-soaked \\"Magic Tree House\\" tales, but without the oh-so-slightly useful factual information.  Instead, the wizardly wonders of \\"Harry Potter\\" and other fantasy worlds have been co-opted and boiled down into a scant 80 pages.  If Abbott is to be commended for anything, it's for his sheer cheek.  With nary an apology he whips up a bunch of fast-paced high-flying adventures artfully stolen from any number of better written books and smooshes them into titles that kids everywhere adore.<br /><br />Eric, Julie, and Neal are best friends.  They play soccer together.  They go to school together.  And when Eric's stuck cleaning the basement on a day that would perfect for a little soccer action, his buds stick by his side and help.  Good thing that they do too.  A mislaid kick of the ball reveals a tiny crawlspace under the basement stairs.  Further inspection, however, leads the three kids to an amazing discovery.  There, leading away from the basement by a flight of rainbow-colored stairs, is a world they never knew existed.  Before they completely realize what is happening, the friends are wrapped up in a race to save the magical world of Droon from the desires of the evil and somewhat fishy Lord Sparr.  Aiding them is the beautiful Princess Keeah, the wizard Galen, and a furry red-headed spider troll named Max.  It's up to them to keep the secret of this magical world and fight the good fight when called upon.<br /><br />First of all, good luck on finding any characters that aren't white and, preferably, blond.  Second, I loved how Abbott covered all his bases.  For the girls who aren't as into fantasy adventure but like princess tales, Keeah covers that particular need.  Eric sports Harry-Potterish glasses (though, to be fair, so does Jack from the \\"Magic Tree House\\" books, so who can truly say what illustrator Tim Jessell was actually ripping off?).  You have your standard Gandalf/Dumbledore white-bearded wizard.  The villain has no real desires beyond power (the all-purpose bad guy need).  Altogether, this is about as generic as they come.  The book is better written than your average \\"Magic Tree House\\" story, of course.  But that's really not saying much.<br /><br />Still, the kids cry for Droon without cease or pause.  They love it.  They adore it.  They'd own every single copy of these books if they could.  I have to fight off swarming hoards of six-year-olds every time I get a new edition of the series on my shelf.  Whence the popularity?  Well, it's hard to deny that Abbott has zeroed in on a really ignored section of the populace.  Kids who can read chapter books but still need pictures and a fast story to help them along are everywhere.  And while I can't help but pray that maybe someday some author will write something just as addictive but a little less ... familiar (let's say) than this, that day has not yet arrived.  So when a child asks me to recommend something since they've read all the \\"Magic Tree House\\" books already, I admit to sometimes leading them over to the \\"Droon\\" section of the library.<br /><br />Hopefully this series will lure kids towards better books in the library though.  In any case, while it won't win any awards for writing anytime soon, \\"Droon\\" is a staple in any library that must entice reluctant readers to its tables.

I couldn't answer because (shame shame) I hadn't read the book.  It's not a long book.  It's not a difficult book.  It's not even a boring book.  Somehow, however, I'd always managed to miss it.  Now my back was to the wall and it was time to read that puppy ASAP.  A cursory glance showed me that the author, Holly Black, wrote one of my favorite teen fairy stories \\"Tithe\\".  The illustrator, Tony DiTerlizzi, was partly responsible for that breathtaking \\"The Spider and the Fly\\" that came out a few years ago.  A little happier with the prospect of spending time with two such enticing names in the child-lit world, I dove into their first book... and was delighted.  I've been railing against early chapter books like \\"The Secrets of Droon\\" and \\"The Magic Tree House\\" series.  These are books that are written for young kids and that are adored widely.  How much more difficult would it be, then, to write similar books but with GOOD writing?  With \\"Spiderwick\\" we have our answer.  It's hard, but not impossible.<br /><br />Three siblings arrive at their new home with a whole lot of baggage (physical and otherwise).  Their mother has divorced relatively recently, and each kid has had to deal with the change in a different way.  Mallory, the eldest at thirteen, has thrown herself body and soul into her fencing.  Simon concentrates more fully on his pet animals and his twin brother Jared... well Jared tends to get into fights at school.  He hasn't found anything to fill the lonely and angry hours spent missing his father.  Almost suspended from his last school, Jared hopes to get a clean start in the family's new home.  It's a huge mansion, falling apart at the seams, that currently belongs to their great-aunt Lucinda.  Once inside, the kids start hearing noises in the walls and finding mysterious rooms without any doors.  Jared alone follows these discoveries to their natural conclusions when he realizes that they aren't the only ones living on the Spiderwick Estate.  Something else is too.  And it's mad.<br /><br />At first glance this title looks like nothing so much as a rip-off of the highly successful (and admittedly better written) \\"Series of Unfortunate Events\\".  It's a foot tall hardback copy done in a classic font with intricate pen-and-ink illustrations.  It even has a note on the back cover reading, \\"Go away / close the book / put it down / do not look\\".  Very Lemony Snicket.  The book is also about three siblings that must deal with a separation within their family, but here the similarities stop.  Obviously the publishers thought it would be a good idea to package \\"Spiderwick\\" books like Snicket's for marketing purposes.  Beyond the obvious outer similarities, however, this book is wildly different.  Written for a younger audience, \\"The Field Guide\\" is far more concerned with faeries and spirits than with the machinations of an evil Count.  There are little clues for kids to solve and a mystery to conquer.  Best of all, however, is the writing itself.<br /><br />You know you're in good hands when the twin brothers featured in your children's series don't always get along and CERTAINLY don't think alike.  Jared and Simon obviously care for one another, but they have spats and fights like any sibling duo.  Their older sister, Mallory, finds herself on the receiving end of a particularly nasty boggart in a scene that many a little sibling will probably be taking notes from.  In the end, however, it's the three of them against the wide fey world.  If you find yourself rooting for them, don't be surprised.<br /><br />Tony DiTerlizzi, as I mentioned before, is responsible for the illustrations here and he owes a great deal to the man credited in his dedication.  Says DiTerlizzi, \\"For ArthurRackham, may you continue to inspire others as you have me\\".  Inspire's one word for it.  DiTerlizzi obviously spent a lot of time poring over Rackham's intricate mysterious (and downright ghoulish at times) paintings in children's books long past.  Here, you have a slightly cleaner version of the old master's critters, but they still convey the right amount of menace when they need to.<br /><br />Kids reading this book may initially be disappointed that there's only a single magical critter to be found within its pages.  Fortunately, the book will certainly whet the whistles of many a fantasy-craving youngster.  If you're going to find your children a young reader series for their perusal, you could do far far worse than this entertaining first book in a five book series.\\"For Arthur Rackham, may you continue to inspire others as you have me\\".

The most loved and hated children's series on the planet.  Worshipped and adored by children and those adults who're just happy to see their kids reading SOMETHING.  Hated by people who can't stand the writing, the plots, and the two-dimensional characters.  These books fall squarely into the deal-with-a-devil category.  On the one hand, if you want your kids to be reading classic literature (and by classic I'm talking \\"Charlotte's Web\\" or \\"The Cricket In Times Square\\") it's hard to come to terms with these lackadaisically typed off books o' dribble.  On the other hand, some kids wouldn't read at all were it not for the continuing adventures of Jack and Annie.  And from \\"Magic Tree House\\" they progress to \\"The Secrets of Droon\\" and then \\"Harry Potter\\" and THEN a little T.H. White or Edward Eager or (dare I say it?) E. Nesbit.  So these are, at best, stepping stone books.  And it all began with that quintessential 1992 classic, \\"Dinosaurs Before Dark\\".  The ultimate in child/dinosaur fantasia.<br /><br />Jack is a man of the world.  He's eight and a half and less inclined to play silly games than his overly enthused little sister Annie.  One day, however, Annie's games lead them both to the discovery of their lives.  While pretending to be chased by a monster, Annie stumbles into the deep woods by their home and finds a mysterious tree house at the top of a tall tall tree.  A quick climb up via a conveniently lowered rope ladder reveals that the room is full to the brim with books of all kinds.  Annie and Jack could certainly have spent a lot of time there in peace, had Jack not opened up a book of dinosaurs and said wistfully, \\"I wish I could see a Pteranodon for real\\".  Quicker than you can say Archaeopteryx the tree house is whisked back in time to a period that I can only best describe as Cretaceous.  There they befriend and fly (??) a Pteranodon, meet a Triceratops, and narrowly escape a rampaging Tyrannosaurus Rex.  By the end, they realize that their tree house must've belonged to someone pretty special.  Only time (and future adventures) will reveal who that was.<br /><br />Reading this book initially left me a little puzzled.  First of all, kids used to be all about the Tyrannosaurus Rex, true.  But since the advent of \\"Jurassic Park\\", some of the old standards have fallen out of favor.  Where, I wondered, were the velociraptors?  A quick glance at the publication date (1992, if you can believe it) showed that this book came out a year before \\"Jurassic Park\\" opened in theaters.  Even so, I was a little put out to discover that as an author, Osborne fails to name all the dinosaurs that appear within the book's pages.  There's a whole clan of reptiles here referred to as, \\"duck-billed dinosaurs\\", almost as if the author didn't know what to call them and couldn't be bothered to check.  This would be forgivable if, at the end of the book, there'd been a page or two of glossary terms and names of dinosaurs.  No such luck.  As you may or may not know, Osborne produces a separate series of fact-filled companion books to her \\"Magic Tree House\\" series that contain all the information her fictional books lack.  That's fine if you know about them and are able to get them into kids' hands.  Otherwise, they go off learning less than they might have in the course of their leisure reading.<br /><br />And of course there are all the usual complaints of just how lame the books are.  We've heard it all before.  The fact remains, however, that these book have been out for almost 15 years and they show no signs of slowing down.  If you've a reluctant reader on your hands, the \\"Magic Tree House\\" series can be your best friend in the world.  They're simplistic, painfully written, and as attractive to little kids as catnip is to kittens.  A sure-fire hit for anyone willing to swallow their pride and hand a couple copies to their little ones.alize that their tree house must've belonged to someone pretty special.

178388:US	49148452	RE3M8SXHOFYZE	0399239855	121650915	Our Secret,Siri Aang (ASPCA Henry Bergh Children's Book Awards (Awards))	Books	5	3	4	N	N	If I bend that far, I shall surely break	A book that bears more similarities to \\"Fiddler On the Roof\\" than (as I originally assumed) \\"Shabanu: Daughter of the Wind\\".  After reading a certain number of children's books, a person runs the danger of becoming ever-so-slightly jaded.  You start ticking of the cultures and countries covered.  Have I read a tale of a nomadic child in the Cholistan Desert of modern day Pakistan?  Check.  How about a child in nineteenth century Southern Libya?  Check.  So when I saw this book about the contemporary trials of a girl living as a Maasai, I was already checking the title off in my head.  I was not particularly heartened by the fact that this book had sat, untouched, in the New Books section of my library for a month or two.  For all its good writing (which I will get to) this book sports a cover that kids do not readily gravitate towards.  And this is a pity.  Author Cristina Kessler is a far better author than most of the two-bit hacks out there, and as a Peace Corps volunteer, she knows from whence she writes.  In \\"Our Secret, Siri Aang\\", we find that all human beings are complex characters with both good and bad inside of them.  It just takes one girl to learn the hard way that her heroes may not be as perfect as they first appear.<br /><br />A twelve-year-old girl in the Maasai culture will inevitably have a lot on her mind at all times.  Namelok is no exception to this rule.  Namelok carries with her the weight of a series of secrets, all exciting and all dangerous.  First, she witnessed the birth of a baby black rhino in the bush, and has committed herself to the health and well-being of both the mama and the child.  Second, her menstrual cycle has just begun, and she wants nothing to do with it.  Menstruation can only mean an end to her childhood days and a fast circumcision (or \\"emuratare\\") before being married off to a man her father chooses.  Third, she wants to learn from the village schoolteacher.  This is expressly forbidden, not only because she is a girl but also because the Maasai do not believe such knowledge to have much use.  All in all, the odds are stacked pretty squarely against Namelok.  Then, one day, things get worse.  Poachers are spotted in town.  Her beloved older brother participates in a bit of foolishness that sets off a whole series of events.  And when Namelok goes to visit her beloved rhinos, she sees vultures circling above.  By the end, Namelok sets out on a quest to bring justice to the world and make her father see her as an equal and not just a young girl fighting to understand the world around her.<br /><br />The book runs the slight danger of falling into the category of girl-refuses-an-arranged-marriage books (ala \\"Catherine Called Birdy\\" or the aforementioned \\"Shabanu\\") or the female-circumcision-in-children's-books camp (as with \\"No Laughter Here\\").  Fortunately, author Kessler avoids such trite topics.  Namelok will have to deal with these problems later on down the line, but this tale is far more concerned with the ideas of change in a community and dying traditions.  Our heroine's father fights the encroachment of unfamiliar ways and, in doing so, is led to a supremely foolish act.  Readers of this book may not initially understand why it is so shameful for young Maasai warriors to pose for tourists' photographs for money, but the story eventually shows just how wrong the act can be.  I loved that this was a book in which the heroine really does grow and mature before your eyes.  I also loved that the ending left multiple strings hanging in the breeze.  If \\"Our Secret, Siri Aang\\" were a more popular title, I would suspect that a sequel might be in the works somewhere.  Alas, this is probably not the case.<br /><br />Basically, this is a good title for those kids who want books with complex moralities.  Where the world is not necessarily drawn into sections that are either black or white.  At the same time, Kessler seems to have a firm grasp on Maasai culture and its people.  You canput yourself completely into her hands as a writer without fear of any skimping on the details.  All in all, the book takes an initially unrecognizable setting and puts the most human of faces onto it.  A splendidly written piece of work.You can put yourself completely into her hands as a writer without fear of any skimping on the details.

Jazz is a good barometer of freedom. - D.E.	Being a relatively new reader of children's books, I tend to go about my systematic reading of all good picture books out there in a backwards manner.  Case in point, Andrea Davis Pinkney.  I first came across this writer, and her talented hubby Brian, through their lovely, \\"Ella Fitzgerald: The Tale of a Vocal Virtuoso\\".  It was through that book that I discovered that the art of scratchboard (remember having to do those in elementary school?) can produce some truly fabulous picture book art.  After reading \\"Ella\\" I doubled back and found her 1999 Caldecott Honor winning baby, \\"Duck Ellington\\".  The book that started it all.  Also using scratchboard (and without relying on fictional talking felines ala \\"Ella\\") the book is a whirlwind biography of one of the world's jazzy greats.  There are tons of picture books about jazz musicians out there today.  Only one, however, has garnered both the Coretta Scott King Award and the Caldecott Honor.<br /><br />In this tale we meet Duke from his baseball playing days in Washington, D.C. Children everywhere will sympathize when Duke decides that learning to play the piano is a waste of his time and that he'd much rather be out and about with his friends.  Fast forward a couple years and an older pool shooting Duke hears the sweet sounds of ragtime for the very first time.  Suddenly the piano doesn't sound so lame, and Duke teaches himself the rudiments of it immediately.  Over time, his particular style and talents get him jobs in clubs and cabarets and at last he forms his own band.  From here on in the book's a whirlwind series of visits to places like the Cotton Club (which I think illustrator Brian Pinkney probably failed to base after the real club itself) and, at long last, New York's Carnegie Hall in 1943.  A matter-of-fact bio at the back as well as a complete bibliography of sources (well done there) round out this lively encapsulation of a life.<br /><br />Kids are often assigned biographies in school, and \\"Duke Ellington\\" has the advantage of being both interesting and filled to the brim with sources and facts.  The story is as lively as Ms. Pinkney could make it, often going into deep descriptions of individual players' talents in the Duke's band.  The art is lovely as well.  Using luma dyes, gouache, and oil paint and then rendering it in a scratchboard style, there's a real throbbing beauty to some of these paintings.  In a final picture Duke conducts his band in a purple suit and the notes of the players curl out as almost iridescent swirls and waves.  Altogether lovely.<br /><br />In many ways, the book's going to be a bore to those kinds who've never heard a jazz note in their lives and don't understand the importance.  If at all possible, try finding a copy of that incredibly amazing film \\"Cabin In the Sky\\" and showing it to the kids and THEN give them this book.  The movie's worth checking out and Duke (with his orchestra) is wonderful in it.<br /><br />Though this is perhaps not my favorite jazz picture book out there (I've still some very fond feelings for \\"Charlie Parker Played Be Bop\\") it's still quite a wonder and worth checking out.  A necessary addition to any well-rounded children's biography section of their local library.advantage of being both interesting and filled to the brim with sources and facts.

The curse reads, and I am quoting here, \\"Thou shalt make no silly poem books without being compared, first and foremost, to Shel Silverstein at all times\\".  Mr. Prelutsky has labored under this curse for years, finding his own way to express himself but undoubtedly gritting his teeth whenever someone, however innocently, says, \\"It's good.  But I think I like 'Where the Sidewalk Ends' better\\".  View now Jack Prelutsky's greatest hour.  In this, quite possibly the best book of haiku for children, he has teamed with remarkable watercolor artist Ted Rand to bring us one of the most beautiful, most well-written, and most deeply moving books of poetry to hit the market in a long long time.  I don't usually bite my cheek in frustration when a book is not awarded a Caldecott Honor after publication, but I do so now (painfully) in spades.<br /><br />The book contains seventeen sweet and simple haikus.  The titular poem reads, \\"If not for the cat / And the scarcity of cheese / I could be content\\".  This sort of sets the tone for the rest of the book.  For once, Prelutsky isn't afraid to bring out the big guns.  He throws out large words that kids will learn simply by reading the poems in the context in which they occur.  Says a jellyfish of deep blue, \\"Boneless, translucent / We undulate, undulate, / Gelatinously\\".  The humor of these poems is of a slower sweeter nature than you'll find in books like, \\"Baby Uggs Are Hatching\\".  A particularly Yoda-like sloth comments with baby on its chest, \\"I am slow I am / Slowest of the slow I am / In my tree I am\\".  I better stop copying down these poems word for word, but you get the idea.  They're all remarkably well-written and some carry a slight philosophical bent.  Of these, the sweetest and most meaningful comes from the surprising source of a mother kangaroo and her joey.<br /><br />The pictures?  The pictures are breathtaking.  It's no wonder that the image of a hummingbird sipping nectar was taken as the cover of the New York Public Libraries Best Children's Books of 2004.  Using a mix of sumi brush drawings in India ink, traditional watercolors, chalk, spatter (no idea), and printmaking techniques on BOTH rag stock watercolor paper and rice paper ... well let's just say a lot of work has gone down here.  I could literally flip through this book all day just staring at the images.  Whether it's a small delicate white moth nearing a homey if dangerous candle flame or a sweet playful otter cracking red spiky urchins on its tummy, Rand has given us a book that is truly worth reading.<br /><br />At a certain time of year teachers will enter my library and ask for recommendations of haiku for their children.  Before, my suggestions were always half-hearted well-I-heard-this-was-goods.  Now I have a book to be excited about.  Even if you don't particularly like haiku as a form (like myself) you will adore this book.  It brings out the best in its author, its illustrator, and the style itself.

The mighty asparagus is on its way.	Prior to this book, Radunsky was probably best known for his illustrated children's books (picture and otherwise) and his insipid, \\"What Does Peace Feel Like?\\" of 2003.  Nothing, in short, that set him apart from the pack of children's illustrators everywhere.  Then he got an idea.  He decided to create a picture book much in the style of such ribald and witty artists as Jon Scieszka and former partner Chris Raschka.  A picture book that strains at the edges of convention.  In short, a crazy amalgamation of classic Italian portraiture, the old Giant Turnip turned asparagus tale, and some mixed media for spice.  The result is a book that may not always work in the ways Radunsky may have wanted it to, but at least it takes a gamble on being a little different.  Other picture books should be so brave.<br /><br />If you know the story of the giant turnip, then this tale will come to you as little surprise.  One day the king is walking around his backyard when he spies a gigantic asparagus, fully grown, standing in the middle of things.  Everyone admits that it is amazing, but the king is determined to remove it forthwith.  Says he, \\"It sticks out like a sore thumb\\".  No amount of pulling or tugging so much as budges the vegetable, however.  His wife, the queen, finds the asparagus to be a beautiful sight.  Her wish is to place it in the center of the palace but both she and the king are unable to move it.  Add on the princess, the bravest the knight in the kingdom, and a mighty rhinoceros, but for all these the asparagus remains.  Finally the king consults his mother and she sends a  single tiny bird, who brings the tasty green tall thing crashing down.  The moral, hidden amongst a lot of jabbering by the king's subjects, boils down to, \\"Even the smallest effort counts\\".  End of tale.<br /><br />It doesn't sound that weird, does it?  Sounds pretty darn typical.  Then you get a gander at the illustrations.  Radunsky usually goes in for crazy original drawings.  Here however he seems to have taken a page from Terry Gilliam's book.  Characters, places, and things are all culled from classic Renaissance paintings, then given extra eyes, crazy noses, and sometimes entirely original faces.  This haphazard conglomeration combines to produce a mighty weird tale.  Then there are Radunsky's words in and of themselves.  A fan of writing in script and saying things like the fact that he himself was born in 1589 and \\"became a participant in, the heroice battle of the Mighty Asparagus (March 1, 1602)\\".  It's possibly the first picture I've ever seen made specifically for children that had honest-to-goodness footnotes in it.  There are also a lot of fun throwaway lines here mixed within the story.<br /><br />Honestly, I haven't a clue if kids will like this story.  Adults certainly will, though the sheer scale of silliness will keep if from being universally beloved.  For originality, however, it's hard to beat.  A fun if somewhat haphazard tale.e however he seems to have taken a page from Terry Gilliam's book.

It is very very hard to name a beloved animal.  Author Lawrence Pringle says in the bookflap that of his books, \\"he is especially pleased with those based on his own family life\\", like this one.  As a result, \\"Naming the Cat\\" isn't exactly new territory, original material, or even particularly interesting fodder for thought.  It's just a nice simple story about a family and their quest to give a new feline companion just the right moniker.<br /><br />When the cat arrived on the family's doorstep he instantaneously became a part of their lives.  No one in the neighborhood claims him, after all, so they adopt him forthwith and get on with the tedious process of slapping him with an appropriate handle.  This proves to be far more difficult than initially expected.  It isn't that anybody lacks for ideas.  People throw out potential titles like \\"Bubba\\", \\"Scruggs\\", and \\"Captain Midnight\\" (my personal favorite).  As time goes on they hear a number of names from a number of sources.  A quick trip to the musical \\"Cats\\", suggests such T.S. Eliot inspired words as \\"Macavity\\", \\"Shimbleshanks\\", and \\"Rumpleteaser\\".  But none of them seem to fit the cat.  Finally, after a series of near mishaps and close shaves, the obvious name of \\"Lucky\\" occurs to the family.  And sticks.<br /><br />Not much drama in this book.  Pringle makes up for this by including a quick action sequence in which the hitherto unnamed cat makes a break from a classroom, dives out a window, and lands in a cushy sandbox.  Otherwise, it's a pretty tame book.  Pringle's story is accompanied by artist Katherine Potter's mild colors.  The cat of the title appears to be a bit like a furry whiskered Buddha (a name that, surprisingly, does not occur to the family).  He's not particularly catlike.  A little too circular.  But kids won't care and Potter does some amusing things with the various names suggested.  With each potential title, she draws the cat living out his new name.  When the name Vanilla Fudge is suggested, you see the cat sitting in a bowl of ice cream.  When the name Scruggs comes up, he's yodeling in overalls to his own cat-sized banjo.  Mild amusement all around.<br /><br />Nothing about this book is going to really stick with the child who reads it for very long.  This is obviously a filler book.  It's not either the author nor the illustrator's best work, nor was it intended to be.  It's just a nice title for any kid who knows from firsthand experience the trials and tribulations of giving a family pet an acceptable name.ingly, does not occur to the family).

There's just no two ways about it.  Either you were completely enamored of her remarkable \\"The Eye, the Ear, and the Arm\\", or you were bored to death.  You either read \\"The House of the Scorpion\\" with bated breath or found yourself yawning far too often to get past page eight.  To my mind, \\"The Sea of Trolls\\" is perhaps Farmer's best book yet.  A quest tale that allows kids to think deeply about morality, life after death, religion, fame, and what it means to be alive, the book is deeply moving and stunningly well-written.  If you couldn't tell, I'm a Nancy Farmer fan.  If you think that you are as well, I invite you to read what can undoubtedly be called the greatest Viking children's book ever written in the English language.<br /><br />Jack and his little sister Lucy live in a quiet Anglo-Saxon village off the coast of Britain in 793 A.D.  Things are going particularly well for Jack too.  He's recently been apprenticed to the town's local bard and is learning how to work small magics.  Jack tutelage is cut short, however, when he and his sister Lucy are captured by violent berserkers (we call them Vikings today) and are taken off to be sold as slaves.  Jack must use all his cunning to keep his sister safe and save them both from Picts, trolls, half-trolls, giant spiders, dragons, and man-eating troll hogs.  The course of his journey will teach him wisdom as well as that fine old art of self-preservation.<br /><br />When it comes right down to it, this is just another story in which a boy with magical powers finds that though he doesn't always know how to use them, through magic he discovers what's really important in the world.  Farmer effortlessly combines Norse myth, Celtic mysticism, and Christianity into a single cohesive understandable whole.  The vision conjured up by this book is ultimately comforting, and for those philosophical ten-year-olds amongst us, it may even offer some answers that other books in their lives have not.  This isn't to say that the book's perfect, of course.  Though born on the Arizona-Mexico border, Farmer has a fine old English detestation for the Picts.  This is more than a little puzzling when she gives so much effort towards humanizing the Druids.  One can only assume that however misguided, she must have had her reasons.<br /><br />Otherwise the book's a dream.  You can wait years and years before finding a fantasy title as good as this.  The characters in it are each and every one of them separate individuals.  Whether it's Thorgil the bad-tempered shield maiden or Glamdis the Troll queen, each person you meet is different.  Farmer even has the wherewithal to work in the story of Grendel and Beowulf as well.  If this book results in kids everywhere asking for translations of Beowulf, it'll have earned itself its own weight in gold.<br /><br />There's an odd note at the back where Farmer compares the Viking raid on the Holy Isle to the attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001.  Obviously she's trying to make the event understandable today, but it comes off as more than a little... well... odd.  The book's attitude towards the violent Vikings is interesting in spite of this.  Farmer's clever enough to render these villain friends as human, but flawed.  You can see their point of view even as you condemn their actions as inhumane.  It should make for some lively booktalk discussions.<br /><br />In the end, all I can say is this: If you want a book for your kids that will get them thinking, this is your best bet.  It's thick and about a period of time long before indoor plumbing, but it's also a fascinating story and a great read.  You'll have a hard time finding anything wrong with it, aside from its size.

If I see a cute corgi or African barkless dog trotting down the street I'll give it a smile and continue on my way.  But truth be told, I'm a cat person.  And cat people tend to like books that are sympathetic towards cats.  \\"Down Girl and Sit\\" has many charms, but this is a dog-centric book through and through.  Filling in yet another gap in the slowly growing genre of first-chapter-books, \\"Down Girl and Sit\\" chronicles the adventures of a perfectly typical canine as she rationalizes the world around her in astounding obtuse ways.  You kids, needless to say, will adore it.<br /><br />Containing four chapters in the life of an average American dog, we meet our heroine Down Girl.  She knows that her name is Down Girl because that's what her owner, Rruff, calls her all the time.  In her first adventure, the titular \\"Smarter Than Squirrels\\", Down Girl and neighbor dog Sit reestablish their superior status over those rotten vermin of the trees and watch new neighbor Here Kitty Kitty get what's coming to her.  \\"I Ate It\\", quite possibly the funniest and best written tale in this book, displays how Down Girl deals with new situations (and edible objects).  \\"Follow Your Brain\\", is a rousing adventure involving a daring escape from her backyard, a quick trip to the park, and a successful nabbing of some truly tasty doughnuts.  The whole thing is rounded off with \\"Dogs Don't Lie\\", a philosophical tale in which Down Girl's loyalties are sorely tried and (with some nummy food and pettings) won over.<br /><br />If your child likes dogs in any way, look no farther than these stories for true down-to-earth enjoyment.  Cat lovers will have a harder time.  After all, poor Here Kitty Kitty ends up dressed up in baby doll clothes more than once and is not exactly given much in the way of any sympathy.  That's undoubtedly because most of the narration comes straight from the mouth of Down Girl herself.  If there's one thing author Lucy Nolan is good at, it's consistency.  Down Girl is a true dog through and through and no matter what the situation is, her voice rings clear.<br /><br />Black and white illustrations, provided by Mike Reed, are nice but won't blow your children away. All in all, this is an ideal first chapter book to hand to a child that's struggling through the form.  The stories will probably strike them as amazingly funny while adults will be pleased to get some of the jokes that their children don't.  Like the \\"Amelia Bedelia\\" books, kids will derive the most enjoyment from \\"Down Girl and Sit\\" when they figure out the things that Down Girl gets wrong.  Though, as I have said, I am a cat person at heart, I am not so narrow-minded as to keep from recommended Nolan's strong early reader.  An excellent selection for homes and libraries alike.od at, it's consistency.

When this man writes a picture book you really get the feeling that he's put his spine and soul into it.  I've had the mixed pleasure of reading a wide variety of Raschka titles in my day.  There was the original if somewhat misguided \\"John Coltrane's Giant Steps\\", the ridiculously simple but fun \\"Yo! Yes?\\", and that remarkable and odd, \\"The Genie In the Jar\\".  If there's one connecting thread between his various works, it's probably rooted in Raschka's deep and abiding love of music.  He's the only picture book artist I can think of that's introduced kids to everyone from Thelonious Monk to (amazing but true) Nina Simone.  For the first time, however, I've found a Raschka book that I could fall head over heels in love with.  Usually I respect the man's work without ever really enjoying his books, if that makes any sense.  With \\"Charlie Parker Played Be Bop\\", however, I think Raschka's really tapped into something amazing.<br /><br />The book's like a single, long poem.  The reoccurring phrase is, \\"Charlie Parker played be bop\\" with the final line always, \\"Never leave your cat alone\\".  That means that a stanza sounds something like, \\"Charlie Parker played be bop / Charlie Parker played saxaphone / The music sounded like be bop / Never leave your cat alone\\".  You get the picture.  Occasionally, however, this book goes all-out silly on you, but with a rhythm that's hard to ignore.  \\"Be bop. Fisk, fisk. Lollipop. Boomba, boomba\\".  And suddenly there are lollipops and odd blue nosed animals tramping across the page in a line, obviously in touch with the beat of the song.  Things get wilder and wilder as the song continues and sometimes you see long lines of overshoes (walking on cute little blue feet of their own), letters in the alphabet, and chickadees be bopping their way down the line.  Finally, we hit the last, \\"Never leave your cat alone\\", and a miserable if resigned pussy stares wearily into the distance.<br /><br />There's an insanity to this book that's difficult to find in other picture books today.  Somehow Raschka has managed to tap into just the right crazy childlike vein.  Kids may not understand what's going on in these pages (and who would?) but they'll enjoy it just the same.  Raschka's toned down his illustrations in a way as well.  Things are kooky here, but they make sense.  This is a kind of jazz put to paper, so there's an order and form to the (at first glance) weirdness.  The pictures all make sense, even if they place bright blue feet on animals or objects that don't usually sport them.<br /><br />If you'd like to expand your child's mind but you just can't figure out how to do so in the best possible way, might I suggest the incredible \\"Charlie Parker Played Be Bop\\".  It's loony and lovable and just the right combination of unpredictable elements all merging together at once.  A truly wild and wonderful picture book.  Well done, Mr. Raschka.

190389:US	49148452	R2A27KSKT9RPXU	0140311769	816141830	Ordinary Jack: Being the First Part of the Bagthorpe Saga	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Puts the "din" in extraordinary	It's been a long time since I read a children's book that really knocked my socks off.  I had heard in various children's book circles about the mysterious Bagthorpe saga.  A series of stories in which a single ordinary boy must learn to live with his genius/insane family.  What I had heard, however, was not exactly conclusive.  For all I knew, these books could be good or they could be overrated justly forgotten tripe of the lowest order.  Out of the merest curiosity (and because I could locate a copy in my library) I found an original 1977 edition of the book, complete with illustrator Trina Schart Hyman's fabulous cover in which every single Bagthorpe member is rendered in the flesh.  What I discovered will now eat up hours and hours of my spare time as I systematically track down each and every Bagthorpe edition in the series available to me.  This is an amazing children's experience that must be read to be believed.<br /><br />Jack is just your average kid.  In any other family, this would be a good thing.  In Jack's family, it's just short of catastrophe.  For you see, in the clan of the Bagthorpes, everyone's a genius.  Jack's brother William has a ham radio, plays darts, enjoys the bongos, and often goes about searching for new exciting talents to add to his bag of tricks (or, as they say, strings to their bows).  Rosie, Jack's younger sister, is an accomplished portrait painter and recently beat Jack at swimming.  Living in such a conceited family might push anyone over the edge, but fortunately Jack has one person he can count on.  His Uncle Parker married into the family and, though extraordinary in his own ways, he's just as normal as his nephew.  Together, the two plan to make Jack into the kind of guy his siblings see as an equal.  They're going to make him into a prophet.  This may mean they'll have to employ dowsing rods, crystal balls, purple suits, bear costumes, and tarot cards, but in the end it'll all be worth it.<br /><br />So many in-jokes, clever puns, and smart plot twists pop up in this book that you'll wonder how long these characters were wandering around author Helen Cresswell's head before she committed them to paper.  Adults reading this book will recognize characters they've met in real life while children will read about them and find themselves wishing they belonged to families just this crazy.  There's more than a little \\"Cheaper By the Dozen\\" in this book, except that each character you meet in \\"Ordinary Jack\\" comes with their own very particular personality.  I can even pinpoint the moment I feel head over heels in love with the book.  After a particularly disastrous birthday celebration that ends in the dining room catching on fire, Uncle Parker laments that, for him, the real loss of the evening was that he won't be able to get the little mottos out of the crackers now.  Americans, unfamiliar with crackers, may need a bit of explanation about this Britishism.  Those who know what they are, however, will be delighted by Uncle Parker's assertion that he collects them so that at parties he can \\"stop conversation dead\\" with one.<br /><br />Will kids like the book?  They won't be able to help but do so.  Jack is completely sympathetic, dealing with his crazy relations by becoming even crazier than they are.  I loved his self-esteem talks to his dog Zero and how the women in the family suddenly start to get involved in Yoga for no particular reason.  Reading this book, you'll forget it was originally published in 1977, so contemporary are some of the terms and fads.  You can only assume that had no-carb diets been around in the late 70s, the Bagthorpes would've been involved in those as well.<br /><br />There are hundreds of children's books that center on crazy families.  Heck, Polly Horvath's practically made her living off of the genre. But the best of all these, by far, is Helen Cresswell's really breathtaking Bagthorpe books.  \\"Ordinary Jack\\" is one of the best children's books I've ever had the pleasure of reading.  A brilliant book for any kid with a sense of humor and a yen for the bizarre.ooks I've ever had the pleasure of reading.

193668:US	49148452	R2GY9AYO67DTL5	068815932X	565802561	The Ugly Duckling (Caldecott Honor Book)	Books	4	9	15	N	N	Honk!	\\"The Ugly Duckling\\" is one of those rare examples of the triumph of image over story.  Anyone who's ever read, heard, or seen performed this story knows that there are elements to it that can make you feel a hair uncomfortable.  After all, the moral of the tale is that it doesn't matter how awful your life has been just so long as you're beautiful and look like all the pretty people in the end.  Even if we dislike what \\"The Ugly Duckling\\" is trying to say, though, it's hard not to be compelled by its striking images.  The cygnet amongst the ducklings.  The resentment directed at him by both the animal kingdom and humankind.  And then, the slow realization that he is in fact the most beautiful creature in the entire world.  If this story were a Grimm Brothers tale it would probably end with the duckling rubbing his newfound good looks in his siblings' faces.  Fortunately, we're in Hans Christian Andersen territory here, and (more specifically) Jerry Pinkney territory as well.  Mr. Pinkney has taken Andersen's original wordy version and pared it down to the point where contemporary children will understand and identify with it better.  He's even changed the moral of the tale oh-so-slightly so that it's less lotsa-pain-equals-more-physical-beauty and more hard-work-will-lead-to-happiness-in-the-end.  I'm not personally buying it, but that's the fault of Andersen.  Not Pinkney.<br /><br />In case you are not familiar with the original Andersen version (and isn't it remarkable that there isn't a Disney version out there somewhere?) here's the lowdown.  One day a mother duck finds that one of her eggs is different from the others.  No explanation of this is ever given.  Pity.  When the eggs hatch the largest/different one takes a long time to crack open and when it does it exhibits a large ugly grey \\"duckling\\". Immediately, trouble starts.  Other ducks bite the duckling's head and its brothers and sisters join in.  It gets so depressed that when a dog passes it over as a meal it can only think, \\"I am too ugly even for a dog to eat\\".  A woman, a cat, and a chicken all find the duckling to be utterly useless.  It freezes in a pond and flees the nice man that frees it.  Finally after multiple trials and countless tribulations the duckling turns into a swan, meets up with its brethren, and discovers the beauty of ... um... beauty.<br /><br />No deep insights in this one.  Now normally I don't much care for Jerry Pinkney's illustrations.  I found his \\"John Henry\\" to be a bit slapdash and his \\"Noah's Ark\\" lacking.  For some reason though, \\"The Ugly Duckling\\" works.  When you consider that I don't usually like the story and I don't usually like the illustrator, the fact that I like the two when combined is just plum weird.  It's not that the story has improved much.  But under Pinkney's hand it becomes tolerable.  Sure, it's still mighty depressing to see the poor little duckling bitten, screamed at, and teased.  But when he's beautiful, there's no arguing with his looks.<br /><br />In the end, I tip my hat to Pinkney's guts.  Some people will pooh-pooh this review because they feel I'm criticizing the story and not the edition itself.  Blarney.  You can't separate this book from the tale on which it's based.  I'm still not a fan of \\"The Ugly Duckling\\".  I think it teaches the wrong lessons in a clumsy way.  But Jerry Pinkney has given us perhaps the only edition of the original story that's readable in this day and age.  For that reason alone the book deserves its Caldecott Honor.a meal it can only think, \\"I am too ugly even for a dog to eat\\".

A wide-eyed youngster walks in, clutching the latest \\"Captain Underpants\\" edition to its chest.  The child has read through every Dav Pilkey book out there and the parent is desperate to keep them reading something... anything!  So what do you hand a child that has gorged his or herself on a steady diet of fart and poop jokes?  Jon Scieszka to the rescue.  As an author, Scieszka has attempted to gets boys to read as much as possible.  Checked out [...] if you don't believe me.  Now none of this is to say that \\"Captain Underpants\\" is strictly a guys book.  Of course it isn't.  But boys do make up the majority of the readers and finding them additional material is nigh unto impossible sometimes.  That's why I love \\"The Time Warp Trio\\".  No, they're not too smart.  No, they won't make your child an instant Honor Student (not on purpose, anyway).  These are just books that slip in tiny bits of factual information along with interesting plots and storylines that are fun.  And \\"2095\\" is just one of the many.<br /><br />As our story begins, our three heroes Fred, Sam, and Joe are facing a deadly Sellbot, 100 years in the distant future.  A quick flashback to the past and we see how they got in that difficult position.  As always, the three boys have a magic book that usually drops them in unknown time periods for no apparent reason.  Fortunately, Joe seems to have found a solution to the problem.  The boys, for the first time, are able to tell the book what year they'd like to go to.  And what time period could be more fun than a quick shoot to 100 years in the future?  Once there, however, the guys bite off a bit more than they can chew.  They have to escape enraged curators, dodge sellbots, learn how to levitate, and order $151 pizza slices.  The real question is, will they ever be able to make it to the past again alive?<br /><br />Admittedly, this is not one of the stronger \\"Time Warp Trio\\" titles.  Unlike some of the previous books, Scieszka doesn't plumb this rich material for all it's worth.  The future looks like every other \\"Jetson\\" inspired flying car fantasy.  Also, it's clear that the author hasn't much hope for future medical technologies if his heroes are convinced that they'll be dead 100 years in the future.  Shouldn't they have done 200, just to be safe?  The plots a little jumpier here than in the other books and some lines of though are a little too frantic.<br /><br />But honestly, we're not debating the merits of a Shakespearean sonnet.  We're talking about good crude fun.  The kind of book that comes up with an amazing array of ways to describe the act of vomiting in a somewhat classy manner.  Now, if you're kid has already fallen for the Time Warp Trio books and you're looking for OTHER boy series reads, I'm rather partial to the \\"Sidekicks\\" series by Dan Danko.  Otherwise, stick with this trio and you'll be just ducky.  Good for those kids that yearn for reading matter that's more silly than cynical.les.

And as a children's librarian, I've found that it's a good idea to find books about female leaders in these fields for those burgeoning geniuses amongst us.  I first heard of \\"The Sky's the Limit\\" while living in Minnesota.  The author, Catherine Thimmesh, is a Minnesotan resident with a keen interest in creating well-written books about outstanding people with XX chromosomes.  As a follow-up to her previous title, \\"Girls Think of Everything\\", \\"The Sky's the Limit\\" is a remarkable and insightful piece of work within its own right.<br /><br />\\"The Sky's the Limit\\" is about those women who've discovered things.  It doesn't matter if those things include dinosaur bones, the fact that chimpanzees use tools, or dark matter.  In this book, women (and girls) are responsible for big changes in the world.  Through Thimmesh's readable text, readers learn about everything from cuneiform script to the creativity of the Anasazi Indians.  Best of all, Thimmesh's final chapter is about contemporary girls and the contributions they have made as well.  These discoveries aren't cutesy taglines to the book either.  One girl discovered for a science fair project that vegetables grown in soil that contained lead-based paint chips grew with dangerously high levels of lead in the fruits and vegetables themselves.  Other girls have found alternative methods of destroying/recycling excess bluegrass as well as inexpensive methods of making bacteria-ridden pond water potable.  These may be young girls, but their discoveries are anything but small.<br /><br />The women in this book are supposed to fall into the category of \\"discoverers\\".  There are, however, a few notable exceptions.  I was delighted to read the story of crazed innovator June Moxon and her quest to drive her original shoe-shaped kinetic sculpture across America.  The only problem is that she doesn't really belong in this book.  What Ms. Moxon did was an act of freedom and originality.  Not discovery, really.  Perhaps she discovered something unique about herself and others (the books says as much) but that's stretching the subject area just a tad.  Thimmesh for her part is an especially engaging writer, finding just the right balance between fact and fancy.  If I've any qualms with the layout in this book, it may be that I wish Thimmesh had included birth dates, just to place the women in this book in context.  Otherwise she can do little wrong.<br /><br />Illustrator Melissa Sweet is just a bit less constant.  Many of these illustrations are original collages that draw the eye around the page.  Sweet is less adept at diagrams.  Too often she relies on her own hand-drawn representations when photographs would have been ideal.  The story of June Moxon may be out of place, but I would have loved to have seen her kinetic sculpture in the shape of a woman's high-heeled shoe.  Instead, we have only Sweet's sketched version, and there's no telling how accurate this really is.  If I could have made any changes at all, I'd have thrown out half the hastily drawn sketches and popped in some lush color photographs for flavor.<br /><br />Still, I doubt you'll find many other women-centric science titles that are half so engaging as, \\"The Sky's the Limit\\".  If you've your own budding genius in the works, male or female, be sure to give them a taste of what human beings are capable of.  A fine book and a fine title.ca.

196904:US	49148452	R36QO46GRG1NV2	0689858396	594238755	The Legend of Buddy Bush (Coretta Scott King Author Honor Books)	Books	4	5	5	N	N	From the pen of Moses	I've often railed, in my various Amazon.com reviews, against simplistic children's books.  For thousands of adults, children's books (to them) are meant to be straightforward tales of good and evil.  The good guys are always good.  The bad guys are very bad.  And this is especially true for poorly written books that deal with race and racism in America.  So it was with great trepidation that I picked up, \\"The Legend of Buddy Bush\\".  Sure, it had won the coveted Coretta Scott King Award.  Sure, it also garnered itself a hard-to-get National Book Award Honor.  But I've read plenty of award winners that left a sour taste in my mouth.  The fact that this was author Shelia P. Moses' first children's book was not encouraging.  Most first time authors make all the usual mistakes.  Fortunately for us, Ms. Moses is not most authors.<br /><br />There are a lot of things in this world that Pattie Mae likes.  She likes eating her grandma's plump strawberries straight from the garden when no one's looking.  She likes sitting and talking with her grandfather for long periods of time.  She likes getting letters from her elder sister in Harlem and dreaming of the day she can leave this poor North Carolina town.  And she loves her Uncle Buddy.  Buddy's not strictly related to her per say, but he's always been a part of her family, especially since he returned from living in New York City.  Now Pattie Mae's grandpa is sick with a brain tumor and the girl really feels she deserves a nice trip into town with Buddy to watch a picture show.  But when Buddy refuses to move off the pavement when a white woman passes him, the woman makes a big show of claiming that Buddy tried to make a pass at/rape her.  Now Buddy's in the violent hands of the law and it's all Pattie Mae can do to see the two most important men in her life, her grandpa and her uncle, slip away from her for entirely different reasons.<br /><br />The book bears a great deal of similarity to Mildred Taylor's chronicles of the Logan family.  As with Taylor's books, the family in \\"The Legend of Buddy Bush\\" are black land holders.  Also, they must deal with their white prejudiced neighbors at every turn.  But this book stands on its own as well.  For one thing, no one here is a perfect saint.  Our heroine, Pattie Mae, is apt to silently insult and detest her female relations while placing the men in the family on their own separate pedestals.  Her Uncle Buddy is a male chauvinist pig who obeys his father but doesn't think twice about ignoring his mother.  Every person in this book is a well-rounded believable human being.  They aren't perfect or always heroic.  The men boss the women around and the women boss the men.  In the end, however, these are people you end up caring for.  So when tragedy comes to Uncle Buddy, you hate to watch it happen.  You may not feel he's the wonderful guy that Pattie Mae thinks he is, but when she and her family collapse weeping to see him working on a chain gang outside their very home, you understand why.<br /><br />In the back of the book, Moses gives full credit to the real Buddy Bush and his story.  She includes pictures of the barn, house, and courthouse when this tale takes place.  She shows us her real grandmother and grandfather and even includes a shot of Buddy Bush himself.  She also tells the story of the real Buddy, complete with the elements that are like and unlike those retold in this tale.  It gives it that little extra shove that brings the book from being okay to quite good.<br /><br />Now I wouldn't go handing this book to your six or seven-year-old.  Though the heroine is twelve there's plenty of breast squeezing and idle speculation on infidelity to make this a bit of an older reader.  Still, if you know a mature child who wants a good jolt of historical fiction, aside from anything Mildred Taylor wrote (and much shorter at that) is this little tale.  It's funny and quite sad, but not depressing in a pathological way.  A title well worthreading.itle well worth reading. <br />	2005-06-21
197619:US	49148452	R4HFX57FYUMSQ	1596430109	241923058	The Bremen Town Musicians: And Other Animal Tales from Grimm	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Play that funky music, animals	Authors tackling Grimm Brother stories today have the difficult task of not always knowing what the best way to present the authors' original material is.  If you've ever read a direct translation of a Grimm story then you know that they have a tendency towards violence, black and white terms of good and bad, didacticism, and some truly disgusting scenes.  For her part, German born Doris Orgel has just translated and retold some of the Grimm Bros animal tales for the pleasure of young readers everywhere.  Orgel recently translated the truly marvelous young adult novel, \\"Daniel Half Human and the Good Nazi\\", but her talents extend beyond rote rewrites.  \\"The Bremen Town Musicians\\" is perhaps one of the smartest, friendliest, and beautiful picture books based on animal Grimm tales available to kids today.<br /><br />The tales included in this collection are the standard tale of the Bremen Town Musicians, The Hare and the Hedgehog, King of the Birds, When the Birds and the Beasts Went to War, The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids, and finally The Fox and the Geese.  Some of these stories will sound familiar.  The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids, for example, has only slight variations from the tale of Little Red Riding Hood.  As such, it's probably the most violent of the tales (which is impressive when you consider the source).  Each story is retold in an accessible and pleasurable way.  Orgel, in her preface, notes that she made a few changes \\"skipping what seemed preachy or obscure, but always very carefully, so as not to harm the 'oldness,' because that's where the magic is\\".  The result is a meticulous series of tales that are just as new an interesting today as they were when first conjured up.  Of these stories, \\"The Fox and the Geese\\" was undoubtedly my favorite.  Not just because I'd never heard the story before, but because there's a great deal of mature joking going on behind the tale.<br /><br />The illustrations in this tale are by Bert Kitchen and compliment the author's tone perfectly.  In many ways, the pictures bear some similarities to those of fellow illustrator Genedy Spirin.  They contain muted natural colors and characters with realistic looks.  In this book, a donkey looks like a donkey and a fox looks like a fox.  Kitchen never makes his characters cartoonish in any way, but that doesn't mean they don't engage in ridiculous behavior.  There is a dignity to this book that, in the hands of any other illustrator, could easily have been lost.<br /><br />If Orgel feels like making a second collection of tales based on Aesop, I wouldn't object a jot.  A companion book would be just the thing to accompany such this particular collection.  In the meantime, consider pairing this book with, \\"Anno's Aesop: A Book of Fables\\" by Mitsumasa Anno for a well-rounded animal-based fable storytime.  Both are necessary to any well-rounded children's literary collection.ent the author's tone perfectly.

If you're an ambitious person with a particular yen to write children's books, there's a sure-fire painless way to do so.  Just take an already existing kid's song in the public domain and accompany your own particular brand of pictures to it.  Sound easy?  Thousands of would-be writers do it every day.  Eileen Christelow's a little different, though.  When she decided to bring, \\"Five Little Monkeys Jumping On The Bed\\" to vivid life, she did so in the knowledge that the song itself hasn't much of a beginning or conclusion.  Add a little nip here and a little tuck there and voila!  Suddenly you've a plausible believable picture book that's so popular that it inspired sequels upon sequels.  And it all began right here.<br /><br />It's bedtime and a family of five monkey siblings bathe, dress, and brush their teeth for slumber.  Their mama says good night to them, but it doesn't take long for pandemonium to ensue.  If you know the song then you know what happens.  One by one the free-spirited primates fall head over heels off the safety of the mattress and land hard on their noggins.  With each additional injury the doctor, called by a frantic mama, gives the no nonsense answer of, \\"No more monkeys jumping on the bed!\\".  By the end the multiple concussions render the little monkeys into an obligatory sleeping state.  And in the next room?  Why there's mama, finally given the chance to do a little bed jumping herself!<br /><br />Text-wise, I did kind of wish that Christelow had taken the time to make the beginning and ending of the book rhyme.  As it stands right now, these words are straightforward descriptive sentences.  How hard would it have been to maintain the jouncy bouncy flavor of the song?  Not hard.  It's a peculiar choice on the part of the author.  Still, aside from that this is a fun book.  Ms. Christelow's illustrations, all done in some colored pencils, give us some pretty raucous animals.  They don't just jump on the bed.  They flounce and fly and pounce and fling themselves hither and thither on the bed.  I also liked the fact that they weren't all boys.  In every other \\"Five Little Monkeys\\" representation out there, the monkeys tend to be male.  As if girls wouldn't jump on a bed the minute they got a chance.  Sheesh.<br /><br />I find the argument from some parents that this isn't a good purchase because it might give your children ideas TO jump on the bed somewhat silly.  Kids like to jump on beds.  If they don't do it now, they will sometime in the future.  And if you want a story where the consequences of bed-hopping are laid out clear as crystal, I can think of no better cautionary tale than \\"Five Little Monkeys Jumping On the Bed\\".  Seriously, people.<br /><br />So Christelow drops the ball a little with her lazy writing, but otherwise this is probably the quintessential book version of the Monkey song.  It's catchy and fun and a fine l'il ole purchase.  Recommended for anyone with a high-spirited monkey of their own.pounce and fling themselves hither and thither on the bed.

What is to account for this?  Can television shows like, \\"Thomas the Tank Engine\\" really sway such vast chunks of the child population, or are shows of that type simply made in response to kids' demands for more train-based entertainment?  I have no idea.  In any case, as a children's librarian I get so many requests for train books that I've gone so far as to type out a list of all the train-related materials my library currently owns.  And on that list is Angela Johnson's, \\"I Dream of Trains\\".  A classier offering than your usual engine fare, Johnson's book gives us a bit of historical fiction couched in a believable, well-written story.  Such attention gives this book an edge over the mindless choo-choo books already out there.<br /><br />In this tale, a young male sharecropper dreams of trains.  Caught in an existence that demands that he break his back picking cotton for hours each day, the boy spends what little free time he has walking the railroad tracks and thinking of the great conductor Casey Jones and his black fireman Sim Webb.  For the boy, his imagination allows him to travel with Casey and leave far behind the land of his youth.  Then, one day, he hears that Casey was involved in a terrible train accident.  His hero collided head on with another train.  When the boy asks his father if that means everything is over, the man replies, \\"No, there'll be other trains and engines\\", and he tells the boy about the vast nation out there.  And his son knows that one day he'll take a train far from here and go out to find his place, \\"in the big wide world\\".<br /><br />In her Afterword, Johnson notes that much of this book is based on historical fact.  For many sharecroppers toiling away in the South, trains represented a real escape from a live of drudgery and pain.  Perhaps Johnson gives herself a little too much freedom in assuming that the idea of the Great Migration came to them after watching Casey's engine, but you don't really mind it.  For many adults reading this note, there's no denying that Ms. Johnson did her homework when she set out to write a meaningful train tale.<br /><br />The illustrations are something as well.  Loren Long, an illustrator who's work tends to grace periodicals mostly, employs some mighty fine acrylics here.  The machines drawn are truly the trains of dreams.  They're impossibly huge and swift.  They move over rich multi-layered landscapes and are truly beautiful.  The close-up of the narrator, wiping his neck in the field while his eyes gaze dreamily into the distance, is a wondrous picture in and of itself.<br /><br />In the end, \\"I Dream of Trains\\" is a hopeful book.  It could have easily come off as a work in which someone spends all their time dreaming and none of their time doing, but this potential pitfall is easily averted.  Lovely to look at with a strong historical background and a noteworthy plot, this book stands apart from many of the usual train-related titles out there.  A worthy purchase for any engine-obsessed young 'un.a little too much freedom in assuming that the idea of the Great Migration came to them after watching Casey's engine, but you don't really mind it.

Tantrums come in a variety of different forms for a variety of different reasons.  In a way, \\"When Sophie Gets Angry\\", is a kind of ideal adult fantasy of how a very particular toddler (Sophie) deals with her own anger.  As with any book in which the title character acts in a less than truly saintlike manner, you will hear objections to this story because... well... because Sophie gets angry.  Really really angry.  And criticizing a children's picture book because it does exactly what it said it would do in its title is just the teensiest bit ridiculous, in my opinion.<br /><br />In this book, little Miss Sophie is happily playing with her toy gorilla when her older sister sneaks up behind and grabs it with a forceful, \\"MY TURN\\".  When that wisest of arbitrators, Sophie's mom, insists that it is indeed her sister's turn after all, Sophie falls headlong and painfully onto the truck that gorilla was in just moments ago.  This does not improve Sophie's mood in the least.  She boils with anger at the injustice of it all.  She feels ready to explode.  She lets loose a \\"red, red roar\\" then runs as fast as she can into her expansive backyard.  There, surrounded by nature, and after having a good cleansing cry, Sophie calms down and looks about her.  High up in an old beech tree, \\"The wide world comforts her\\".  Ready for civilization once more, Sophie returns to her family (who is glad to see her) and helps them complete a puzzle.  \\"And Sophie isn't angry anymore\\".<br /><br />How you, personally, want your child to express his or her anger is entirely up to you.  In the case of this book, the parents have obviously told Sophie in the past that if she wants to be angry she can do so in their park-sized backyard where she's free to express herself without bothering anyone.  Maybe you prefer your child to punch a pillow or scream into their bedsheets.  This is Sophie's solution, and it's a good one.  Though she does let out one particularly nasty roar, she doesn't flop down onto the ground in a screaming fit or pound her sister with her little fists.  Her method is to be brought back to herself by interacting with nature.  There are far worse ways to deal with anger out there.<br /><br />Molly Bang as an artist has a range that is to be admired.  Though this is perhaps her best known book, the first Bang creation I ever laid my eyes on was her stunning, \\"My Light\\".  In that book she spends an unaccountable amount of time painting tiny dots of light and energy.  In this book, she spreads thick primary colored paints out to convey the emotions of the story.  Everyone in this book carries about them a thin sheen of one color or another that shows their mood.  When the book begins, Sophie's a mild orange/yellow.  The minute she encounters her sister's greed, however, that orange turns a brilliant vibrant red.  It ululates off of her in waves, coloring the world around her.  Only when she finds herself surrounded by the calming purples and blues of the trees in the forest is Sophie able to come to herself once more.  By the end, everyone in the home is a soft yellow (including the cat) and Sophie plays once more.  There aren't any tiny details or meticulous fine point drawings here.  This is a story that demand big bold colors in big bold pictures, and it delivers.<br /><br />Of course, not all parents are going to like, \\"When Sophie Gets Angry\\".

Without hesitation the woman said that it was, \\"My Chair\\", by Betsy James.  I found myself a little ashamed to admit that I hadn't heard of this title before.  On hearing me say this, the woman nodded her head a little sadly but reiterated that the book, in her eyes, was a wonderful creation and deserved more attention than it had received.  Intrigued, I sought out \\"My Chair\\" and read it for myself.  However, being (at my core) a lazy lazy person, I neglected to write a review of it until now.  Certainly \\"My Chair\\" will have its fans, and it is undoubtedly a pleasant little book, but whether or not it deserves the lack of attention it has received is not for me to say.<br /><br />In a city park, children gather together with various things on which to sit.  Each kid talks about their \\"chair\\".  A boy in a tire swing says that his works, \\"because I bend in the middle\\".  A girl on a big comfy sofa says with glee, \\"My chair is squishy.  It eats people\\".  A boy in a wheelchair proclaims proudly, \\"mine's more like a horse or a train.  It's not quite legs, and not quite wings...It's like glasses - I put it on in the morning\\".  Slowly, more and more children gather, stretching their imaginations hither and thither.  At one point, complete and utter bedlam breaks out and an image of a boy in a corner accompanies the text, \\"In my chair I consider what's fair\\".  Finally, by the end of the book the kids see the person they've all been gathering for.  A new baby arrives to meet them, and her present is a bouncy chair, all her own.  The final parting shot shows everyone still in the park, only now it is nighttime and people are either reading books or discussing the new child.<br /><br />It's a sweet subject and a sweet book, but not a particularly satisfying creation.  Kids reading through, \\"My Chair\\", will certainly enjoy catching all the little details that appear from page to page.  When one girl mentions that other animals never use chairs, the kids around her pretend to be a variety of different creatures.  I was a little disturbed by the fact that though characters speak all the time, nobody ever opens their mouth when talking.  This isn't because their monologues are silent.  As pointed out earlier, kids react to what their friends say.  It's simply a somewhat bizarre choice on the part of illustrator Mary Newell DePalma.<br /><br />When it all comes down to it, however, \\"My Chair\\" can make for an enchanting read.  Maybe there were elements to it I would've changed.  Maybe the pairing of author and illustrator is not as seamless here as in comparable picture books out there.  But there's a real sense of community and friendship in this book that's difficult to dismiss.  Though I was not as taken with it as I would have liked, it still makes for an interesting read.  Recommended with some slight reservations.ll certainly enjoy catching all the little details that appear from page to page.

It's simply a somewhat bizarre choice on the part of illustrator Mary Newell DePalma.   <br />  <br />When it all comes down to it, however, \\"My Chair\\" can make for an enchanting read.  Maybe there were elements to it I would've changed.  Maybe the pairing of author and illustrator is not as seamless here as in comparable picture books out there.  But there's a real sense of community and friendship in this book that's difficult to dismiss.  Though I was not as taken with it as I would have liked, it still makes for an interesting read.  Recommended with some slight reservations. <br />	2005-06-14

Galdone is, for many people, the man who produces those fairy tale picture books that are the go-to versions at all times.  Want a classic version of The Three Bears, Cinderella, or Henny Penny?  Doubtless some well meaning children's librarian will recommend him in a trice.  Personally, Galdone bores me.  His books, while nice and all, haven't the flavor, pep, or verve of some of the other (better) publications out there.  Overall, I see Galdone as a rather dull author/illustrator.  But every rule has its exceptions.  In this case, the exception is, \\"Cat Goes Fiddle-I-Fee\\".<br /><br />If you've ever heard the tune of this song then the book will adapt perfectly to your lilting voice.  This is one of those classic animal sound songs.  But unlike such contemporaries as Old MacDonald, Fiddle-I-Fee is novel because some of its animals make uncouth and odd noises.  The book begins with the words, \\"I had a cat and the cat pleased me, I fed my cat by yonder tree.  Cat goes fiddle-i-fee\\".  And we're off.  Already the cat is making a sound that I've never heard come from a feline yawp.  The boy who is telling this tale then feeds a hen, a duck, a goose, a sheep, and many other animals before being fed himself from grandma's picnic basket.  The final parting shot is of the cat sitting in the basket laughing to the words, \\"And cat went fiddle-i-fee\\".<br /><br />I wouldn't go so far as to call myself a Galdone convert, but this book is great.  First and foremost, there's the cat itself.  The first picture of the animal shows it lapping up a bowl of milk looking very much like a real honest-to-goodness kitty.  It's as if Galdone's saying, \\"Oh sure, I can draw realistic cats.  But check THIS out\\".  Then, for the rest of the book, the cat's gone wild.  It leaps after butterflies.  It laughs uproariously at the other animals it sees.  For more than half the book we see the pussy as it hangs lackadaisically from a tree branch, observing the folly of the other animals below.<br /><br />One of the most charming elements of the book, as I alluded to before, is the odd animal sounds each barnyard creature makes.  I'm willing to believe that a hen goes \\"chimmy-chuck, chimmy-chuck\\".  But when a pig says, \\"griffy, gruffy\\" and a goose goes, \\"swishy, swashy\\", I begin to get confused.  Still, it's these little tidbits of silliness that make the whole darn thing so doggone appealing.<br /><br />If you've never read a Paul Galdone picture book before, this is the place to start.  It's a fine frolicsome affair that will have you singing \\"fiddle-i-fee\\" for months and months to come.

And author/illustrator Byron Barton is, if nothing else, the patron saint of picture book straightforwardness. There is no wry undertone to a Barton book. No sly wit. No winks or nods to parents and educators beneath the simple childlike text. Nope. Byron Barton is an author that writes stories for children and children alone. In \\"Machines At Work\\", Barton (who's millions of books have covered every topic from planes to dinosaurs) tackles that perpetual toddler fascination - - the worksite.<br /><br />In this particular book, we observe a wide variety of small workers (male, female, white, black, etc.) off to work. Some climb readily into their machines. Others dictate instructions from below. For this day, the workers knock down a building, bulldoze trees, dump rubble, take a lunch break, build a building, and build a road (amongst other activities). Then the expressionless crew heads for home after a long and satisfying day. Says the text, \\"More work tomorrow\\".<br /><br />The book begins with the sentence, \\"Hey, you guys!\\". For those parents amongst you who remember the heyday of that classic PBS show, \\"The Electric Company\\", you know how best to read that line. Otherwise, the sentences in this book tend to be instructions. The narrator (and, hence, the child reading the book) tells the little people what to do and they do it. I was intrigued by the prior reviewer of this book who commented that though we see the workers apparently build a road and building, no final product is ever shown at the end. It would be nice to see the result of all this work. Obviously Barton thinks kids would be far more interested in the breaking down and building up than in the end products. I was also a little amazed at the amount of destruction in this book as opposed to the significantly smaller amount of construction.<br /><br />But these aren't really criticisms. If you've a kid who likes machines that go vroom and boom, it's hard to find fault with this book. There are plenty of simple words with thick black lines for kids to understand. No, it won't name the machines one by one. You'll have to find a different book for that. Still, it's a nice enough preschool title to entrance those kiddies who're already enamored of these friendly agents of destruction. A simple text that is certain to find a wide appreciative audience.he significantly smaller amount of construction.  <br /> <br />But these aren't really criticisms.

Parents often want books for their kids that discuss bullying, a death in the family, or the advantages of being potty trained.  One of the requests I have not yet received, but I expect to, is for books that contain children of divorce.  Specifically a book series.  There are remarkably few that I could spontaneously come up with off the top of my head but, \\"Amber Brown Is Green With Envy\\", a title in the popular Amber Brown series, is one of those few.  Paula Danziger died on July 8, 2004 but her tender, well-written Amber books will remain a favorite of children everywhere for decades to come.<br /><br />In this particular installment in the series, Amber Brown has adjusted to living with her father sometimes and her mother sometimes.  When she's at her father's house, Amber enjoys spending time with his wacky upstairs neighbors.  When she's at her mother's home, she enjoys her old friends and school.  Unfortunately, this kind of perfect arrangement cannot last.  Amber's mom and Max (her mom's boyfriend) are getting married soon, a fact that Amber is pleased about (and her dad is not).  Unfortunately, this means that the new family is going to have to move into an entirely new house.  Possibly out of town.  Amber, faced with the prospect of losing all her friends, her favorite teacher, and her school is understandably upset.  Fortunately, she's surrounded by caring adults that know exactly how to help her make her feelings known on this and many other subjects.<br /><br />Amber Brown, as a character, is one of those fictional children that are a little more gifted than their real-life contemporaries.  When Amber sits her mother down and explains to her why she's currently angry, she does so with a maturity that I wish most adults today had.  The funny thing about Amber, aside from her wise-beyond-her-years speech, is that she's a likable character that isn't bratty in the least.  Most books with characters of this sort, whether they be Junie B. Jones or Judy Moody, have a streak of preciousness to them.  Not Amber.  When she's angry or sad, she has every right in the world to be so.  For example, when her father (after talking about how he wants to spend as much time with Amber as possible) leaves on a date on the same night that he promised Amber he'd go to the movies with her, she's furious.  And with good reason.  There's something particularly satisfying in the scene where she confronts him with this fact.<br /><br />I should clarify that even if Amber Brown says things that a normal nine-year-old would probably be incapable of (even if they felt the way she did, they wouldn't have the ability to put those feelings into words) she's still a completely believable character.  Full credit should also go to illustrator Tony Ross for his simple yet right-on-the-money pictures that accompany the tale.  The more I read this book, the sadder I became that Paula Danziger will no longer be around to follow up on Amber's later years.  Ah well.<br /><br />Until reading this book I had no idea why my library branch had so many books in the Amber Brown series.  Now I understand.  A well-written series for kids that tackles a tough subject like divorce (and kids caught in the middle of it) doesn't come along every day.  But when it's as beautifully penned as \\"Amber Brown Is Green With Envy\\", you'll never search for another.ks with characters of this sort, whether they be Junie B.

Illustrator (Awards))	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Dance dance wherever you may be	Whenever I see yet another children's picture book celebrating the heyday of jazz, bebop, and swing I always wonder how interesting that book is to the intended child audience.  I mean, sure \\"Ella Fitzgerald: The Tale of a Vocal Virtuosa\\", by Andrea Davis Pinkney is fun, but do child readers dig it?  Or do they just see it as yet another history lesson disguised as a book?  With this in mind, \\"Jazzy Miz Mozetta\\" is extraordinary because even though it covers some old-fashioned odes to the dances of yesteryear, kids will enjoy reading and watching this extraordinary heroine as she bops, jitterbugs, and re bop she bams her way through the night.<br /><br />One evening, sweet Miz Mozetta decides to doll herself up for a stroll in the moonlight.  She applies Pretty Plum powder, Tango Mango lipstick, and a dress of a distinctive red sheen.  Once outside, she runs into three of her friends while across the street some kids dance and jive to their beatbox.  In a rare humor, Miz Mozetta asks the kids if she can join in, but their skepticism puts her off.  Her friends won't join her either, so it's up to her apartment she clumps where she decides to turn up the radio and dream of dancing days.  Fortunately for us, the tale doesn't end there.  Her friends, lured by Miz Mozetta's spunk and the music from the band, put on their finest swing clothes and zoot suits and start some serious jitterbugging.  Now it's the kids asking if THEY can join in on the fun and by the end everyone's cutting a rug in Miz Mozetta's snazzy living room floor.<br /><br />There are tons of children's picture books out there that have elderly adults as their heroes, but few in which those adults dance as wildly and extravagantly as this.  Author Brenda C. Roberts has a good ear for the cadences and wordings required for such a jazzy snazzy book as this.  There's wonderful repetition and the characters speak affections like, \\"chickadee\\" and \\"honey dear\\".  When Miz Mozetta's friends come in to dance the night away, one man's hair, \\"was shiny and slick and blacker than black and smelled like shoe polish\\".  Couple this with first time children's illustrator Frank Morrison and you've got yourself a pretty little picture book.  Morrison may never have helped create a book for kids before, but he's the perfect person to pair with Brenda Roberts' words.  His Miz Mozetta all akimbo arms and straight strong legs.  Characters in this book twist their bodies into an assortment of strange shapes and angles.  Best of all are the wild dancing sequences where the multicolored elders regard the baggy clothed youngsters then burst into magnificent twirls and romps.<br /><br />The book's certainly the kind of thing to wake the kids up with, that's for sure.  If you want a high stepping picture book to accompany your dance-centric storytime (of which books like \\"Dumpy LaRue\\" and the aforementioned \\"Ella Fitzgerald\\" would have to be a part of), this book has your number.  A visual stunner with a great sense of wordplay to boot.nce the night away, one man's hair, \\"was shiny and slick and blacker than black and smelled like shoe polish\\".

209396:US	49148452	R20ENB2WFVYMCC	0689847939	668131654	Counting Our Way to the 100th Day!	Books	3	1	2	N	N	It's the final countdown	Once in a while you see a picture book that steeps its illustrations in a thick coat of heavy-duty nostalgia. The somewhat recent \\"Halibut Jackson\\" had it. Anything by Hanako Wakiyama has it. And Betsy Franco's, \\"Counting Our Way to the 100th Day\\" has it too. Now there are plenty of books out there that discuss the 100th day of school for kids. I'm not entirely certain why this is. I mean, it's not as if school gets out on the 100th day or any particular celebration takes place at that time. Still, like its predecessors before it, \\"Counting Our Way\\", is goes through the usual rigmarole of checking off each day. As it stands, it's a perfectly nice book but not one that you can separate from its gimmicky premise.<br /><br />For each day that's counted down in this hefty 48 page tome there are poems of varying lengths. The poems here have one common thread running through them: They must count 100 of something within their lines. A simple sounding premise, Franco exhausts every conceivable thing a child could count. Patchwork quilt squares, ostriches, centipede feet, etc. But since this kind of exercise might prove dull, she spots other poems with thoughtful ponderings on everything from the size of coins to the way to create 100 perfectly planted flowers. By the end, 100 poems have been successfully completed and 100 days counted down.<br /><br />There's a small flaw with this book. It may count down 100 days from the beginning of school, but it doesn't tend to keep its poems season-centric. Therefore poem #78 shows a kid in shorts while poem #10 is under the impression that dandelions are still in bloom in August. To be fair, though, Franco does tip her hat to a rough approximation of where holidays land. The best use of this book, by far, would be by teachers in schools. They could turn \\"Counting Our Way to the 100th Day\\" into a poem-a-day presentation. That way, kids would look eagerly towards hearing what the author has in store for them each and every day they're in the classroom.<br /><br />But will kids pick up this book on their own? Not so much. I'm not saying it's impossible but I've had two copies of this puppy in my New Books section of my children's room for 2 months, and neither parents nor children have been inclined to nab it. I think it definitely (like all the other 100 day books before it) has its uses, but I cannot imagine the child that checks it out for their own reading pleasure. Just my two cents.hey're in the classroom.  <br /> <br />But will kids pick up this book on their own? Not so much.

You know, for years I thought I disliked the tasty carbo-loaded concoctions simply because the only ones I'd ever eaten were of the gawdawful frozen variety.  Maybe I would've come to bagels a little sooner in life had I had access to a book like \\"Where On Earth Is My Bagel?\\".  Taking an essentially ridiculous idea (bagels are the stuff of visions and portent-laden dreams) the book is a nice little tale of a boy and his mini-quest for a good old-fashioned schmear.<br /><br />Yum Yung, who has lived all his life in Korea, awakes from a mid-afternoon nap one day to declare with very little doubt in his mind, \\"I want a bagel!\\".  This being rural Korea, New York bagels are (to say the least) a teensy bit scarce.  This fact does not deter Yum Yung in the slightest, however.  Without further ado he finds himself a pigeon and ties a note to its leg that amounts to a one-bagel order form.  The pigeon takes off but no bagel returns to Yum Yung.  He asks everyone he knows if they happened to get it by mistake.  Sadly, the man working the wheat field hasn't.  The fisherman working the salty sea hasn't.  Even the woman tending the beehives hasn't.  Yet to Yum Yung's delight, the pigeon returns with a bagel recipe (the note explains that bagels older than a day are not exactly edible) and the boy is able to get wheat, salt, and honey from the three people he bugged just the morning before.  At the end of the story Yum Yung and his friends create an enormous bagel and sit down to a one-food-only feast of sorts.<br /><br />The first two pages of the book show the Atlantic Ocean with New York and its tantalizing bagels on one page and Yum Yung, hands pressed dramatically to his chest, on the other.  As another reviewer of this book pointed out, this shot is a bit askew, with Korea ending up where Spain could be.  My only other grief with the book was that it did not include the recipe that Yum Yung received from New York.  Books of this nature are especially good at getting you to crave the items they write of.  How hard would it have been to include instructions for making your own?  Not everyone lives in New York, after all.<br /><br />Otherwise, the story's rather sweet.  I give a lot of credit to the book for having such a bizarre premise.  The pictures will not blow you away and the writing is somewhat pat, but this is a nice little tale that follows the rule of three and has a satisfying and delicious conclusion.

I began the wrong way.  Not knowing the multiple quartets within the series, I oh-so-innocently began by reading the very well written but exceedingly complex, \\"Trickster's Choice\\".  Now I know that that particular book is pretty much the thirteenth book in a series that began here with \\"Alannna: The First Adventure\\".  So I have returned to the very beginning (a very nice place to start) with this tale of a girl's rebellion against an unjust system.  I found I enjoyed the book exceedingly, and was delighted to find that the titles have been repackaged with beautiful new covers so as to entice a whole new troop of fans (covers that, oddly, Amazon.com doesn't advertise openly).  But I was also shocked to find that the intricate complexities I encountered in \\"Trickster's Choice\\", weren't necessarily there because of the twelve books preceding it.  Even \\"Alanna\\" contains some high politicking in an obviously well-thought out world.  It makes for an entrancing read.<br /><br />Alanna and her twin Thom have a problem.  Thom is about to be sent off to become a knight while Alanna is to be trained in the art of girlishness and sorcery.  Trouble is, Thom is the one who likes magic and Alanna is the one who wants to fight.  The solution to the problem is simple.  The two need only switch places with some forged letters and willing servants in tow.  In this way, Thom goes off to join a monastery and learn sorcery and Alanna (disguised as a boy) enters the world of knighthood.  She begins as a page and works as hard as possible to prove herself.  Sometimes that means taking on bullies or besting her fellows in a bit of swordplay.  Other times it means befriending thieves and princes alike and even using her gifts to heal royalty of sickness.  All this work may mean that great things are to come from Alanna but only time will tell if she gets through her trials intact.<br /><br />Alanna is a difficult heroine to love in some ways.  Essentially humorless (a fact that most differentiates her from her daughter in \\"Trickster's Choice\\"), she isn't much of a thinker.  More, a doer.  But do she does, and well.  Pierce has no qualms with starting the tale and then rushing into the story headlong.  You're literally two pages into the book when Alanna comes up with the idea of the switch.  From then on the book's a whirlwind series of tests and trials for the diminutive young lady.  It's funny, but the book that this title reminded me the most of, as I read it, was \\"Ender's Game\\", by Orson Scott Card.  An odd comparison but not entirely insane, if you think about it.<br /><br />Concerned parents will gasp in horror as this book matter-of-factly confronts things like puberty and procreation.  Ho hum.  In many ways, this might be the best way to get boys to understand the complexities of female menstruation.  Don't let the warnings fool you, though.  This book's tame tame tame.  I have it in the children's section of the library in which I work and I wouldn't move it anywhere else if you asked me to.  When it comes down to it, this is just a great adventure story for those boys and girls that want something classy but a little different from the average page-becoming-a-knight fare out there.<br /><br />It was originally written in 1983, but \\"Alanna: The First Adventure\\", hasn't aged a jot.  A must-read for anyone willing to tackle the immense Tortallian world of Tamora Pierce.  A fine fun romp.  Not to be missed by serious fantasy fans.nna is a difficult heroine to love in some ways.

Which is to say, it's the rare book that shows family relations in a realistic, yet affectionate, way.  Javaka Steptoe has a style and voice that is uniquely his own.  In this particular book, he creates a living breathing urban family environment, the like of which has not been seen since the heyday of those marvelous Ezra Jack Keats stories.  Here we have a great story, in an innovative package.<br /><br />Steven awaits, with baited breath, the postcards his world traveling aunt sends him whenever she goes away.  For years he's lived through Aunt Carolyn's adventures second-hand, and at long long last she's coming to visit her favorite nephew and his family.  That means it's time to party.  While the rest of his family prepares for a delicious street barbecue, Steven frets over finding his aunt the perfect welcome-home gift.  When at last he enlists the help of his money-happy Uncle Charles (\\"he wouldn't do anything unless you paid him\\") he finds a present that his aunt can truly love for all time.  And in the end, Aunt Carolyn gives Steven the one thing he's always wanted.<br /><br />I was pleased with the arc of the story, especially the wide range of characters brought to vivid life through Steptoe's descriptions.

215431:US	49148452	R28LIUFZE4U359	0374422389	736065971	The Eyes of the Amaryllis	Books	4	14	15	N	N	Mysterious fathoms below	Before reading \\"The Eyes of the Amaryllis\\", I'd harbored the secret suspicion that Natalie Babbitt's best known work, \\"Tuck Everlasting\\", was a fluke.  I don't mean to say that the great writing found in that book was of a fluke-like nature.  I mean that I thought of Babbitt as a children's author who preferred to write realistic fiction and once, in the case of \\"Tuck\\", wrote something fantastical.  I don't know where I got that idea.  Maybe it came from \\"Tuck\\" itself.  There's something about that book that feels a little too natural.  Like the author would much rather be writing about hardcore issues and is just using the whole \\"living forever\\" thing as a metaphor.  So when I picked up \\"The Eyes of the Amaryllis\\", I thought I'd know what to expect.  A straightforward story about a girl and her grandmother by the sea.  What I got instead was a supernatural thriller in which two mortal souls go head to head with forces they cannot hope to understand.  Thrilling?  You don't know the half of it.<br /><br />Though named after her father's mother, Jenny Reade has never visited the old woman at her house by the sea.  This is mostly because Jenny's father is afraid of that cruel old ocean.  Years ago, when he was just a teen, her dad watched in horror as his father's ship, the Amaryllis, went down in a catastrophic storm.  Since that time he has been afraid of the vastness of the ocean while his mother, the hardened woman Geneva Reade, has waited patiently for a sign from her drowned husband.  When Jenny comes to stay with Geneva for a couple weeks, she thinks she's just going to do some chores and play by the seaside.  Instead, she becomes enmeshed in a wild adventure.  For while Geneva's husband does indeed send his wife a sign, the sea is not happy with the gift and demands it back.  By force, as it happens.<br /><br />Reading this book, I found it was rather similar to \\"Daughter of the Sea\\" by Berlie Doherty.  Both books praise the ocean to no end, but if I were to choose the stronger of the two, \\"The Eyes of the Amaryllis\\" wins hands down.  Babbitt's in fine form here.  The reader begins the tale with as much healthy skepticism as Jenny herself, and ends up believing her grandmother's wild stories just as the heroine does.  There are beautiful descriptive passages here and a wonderfully exciting climax with a hurricane.  There are ghosts, drowned men, and mysterious presents that are never meant to be kept.  I've little doubt that Babbitt herself has spent a lot of time with the ocean.  This book is a love story to a powerful, dangerous thing.<br /><br />For those readers who enjoyed \\"Tuck Everlasting\\" and wouldn't mind a little more Babbitty weirdness in their reading diet, \\"The Eyes of the Amaryllis\\" is a fine follow-up.  It's not particularly long (so reluctant readers will rejoice) and the plot is fast-paced without ever feeling stilted.  For any kid who hungers for tales of ghosts and mysteries, go no farther than this fog-swept tale.to choose the stronger of the two, \\"The Eyes of the Amaryllis\\" wins hands down.

It\\", was an amusing series for middle readers called the \\"Guy\\" books.  Like many children's authors before her (Louis Sachar, for example), Weeks began her career as an author with light fluffy material.  Then, out of nowhere, she creates this remarkable, complex, deeply moving book.  \\"So B. It\\" may well be the first step towards making Sarah Weeks one of the great writers for kids of this era.  She has taken a difficult (some might say impossible) subject, given it warmth and intelligence, and created one of the best books of 2004.  If you want to give a kid something to read that's interesting and insightful, but also contains more complexity than your average \\"Droon\\" chronicle, I can't recommend this book any more highly.<br /><br />Heidi It has always, so far as she has known, lived with her mother and her neighbor Bernice (Bernie) in their apartments in Reno.  Heidi's family is remarkable for a great many reasons.  Her mother, So B. It, has, what Heidi matter-of-factly calls a \\"bum brain\\".  She's mentally handicapped and has only the capacity of saying only 23 words altogether.  Bernie is a neighbor who has always cared for Heidi in ways that So B. It could not.  Unfortunately, Bernie has agoraphobia and can't exit their apartments for any reason.  Heidi, for her part, is what you might call normal were it not for one remarkable fact.  She's lucky.  Anytime her household needs a little more money to fix the vacuum cleaner or to pay an unexpected bill, Heidi tromps down to the local slot machine, wins a load of cash, and gives it to Bernie to use.  And life with these three might have gone on in this fashion had it not been for a couple mysteries that Heidi wanted to solve.  First of all, her mother can only say 23 words.  One of them is \\"soof\\".  Heidi wants to know what that word means, but her mom hasn't the capacity to understand or say.  Second of all, baby Heidi and So B. It arrived in the apartment next to Bernie's years ago without anything but the clothes on their backs.  And finally, Heidi finds an ancient camera in her apartment with film that has never been developed.  Film, that dates back to before Heidi was born.  Film, that might answer some of the questions she so desperately needs.<br /><br />The book's a mystery at heart.  Heidi's personal quest to track down her past and find where she comes from is both believable and the kind of thing kids can identify with.  In spite of Bernie's objections, she goes out into the cold world to find what she wants most.  Weeks, as a writer, deftly weaves different lessons and wisdoms into her text without ever making it preachy or didactic.  Heidi says right from the start that there are some things in this world that you cannot know.  That's a truth that places the rest of the book in a distinct and curious light.  For her part, Heidi learns quite of a bit of the truth, even if large chunks are missing here and there.<br /><br />What was most impressive about the story though was the character of So B. It.  How do you go about creating a mentally handicapped character without reducing her to stereotypes or oversimplification?  Somehow Weeks has managed it, and the result is an astounding novel.  Quite frankly, this book hinges on whether or not you find the character of So B. It realistic and sympathetic.  Weeks treads carefully around her subject but makes it perfectly clear that in spite of her problems, this is a woman who cares deeply for the people who love her.  Even if she can't express it all the time.<br /><br />There are also some touchy subjects that Weeks skirts around believably.  As I read the book, I wondered how the author would deal with the details of Heidi's conception.  I won't give anything away but to say that the book's a class act and the subject, which is addressed in a child-friendly manner, works.  And by the way, if you're worried about whether ornot this title will be interesting to kids, don't be.  The writing here is great, riddled with mysteries and lots of lists that Heidi likes to keep things straight in.<br /><br />That this book never received so much as a Newbery honor rankles me.  Not that the actual winners weren't deserving, but this is a truly beautiful book that every child should know.  My greatest fear is that someone somewhere will get it mixed up with the far more mediocre, \\"Ida B\\", which came out in the same year.  For those who locate this title correctly, however, they will find something that is appealing to kids and yet is well written enough to earn the respect of adults as well.

217909:US	49148452	R361JX5LZZ9P7P	0670059080	951341550	Journey to the Bottomless Pit: The Story of Stephen Bishop and Mammoth Cave	Books	3	13	14	N	N	Come follow follow follow follow follow follow me	Let's say you hear about a historical figure that strikes you as so interesting that you'd like to write a book about them.  A book for children, say.  When you make the decision to write such a book, two possible ways of proceeding are open to you.  You can make your book a fascinating work of non-fiction that adheres strictly to the facts of the case.  Or, you can take the already existing facts and use fictional dialogue to cushion the details of this person's life, thereby making it more interesting to your intended audience.  Now, if you decide to go with the latter you've placed your book in a peculiar position.  On the one hand, your story is about a real person who really existed.  On the other hand, because you made up dialogue and situations that may never have happened in the way you've described them, your book is doomed to the fiction shelves of the library.  Author Elizabeth Mitchell, when she learned the details of explorer Stephen Bishop's life, decided to go the fiction route.  Personally, I feel that this was bad decision to make on her part.  For while this book contains a multitude of wonderful details and facts about a fascinating man, Mitchell has couched her book in stilted dialogue and poor writing.  She would have done better to stick to the facts.<br /><br />Stephen Bishop was born a slave in the state of Kentucky in 1821.  His owner Frank Gorin, owned the Mammoth Caves and needed a tour guide to schlep tourists in the busy summer months.  Enter Stephen.  Fascinated with the caves, Stephen proceeded to explore beyond the usual paths.  As he did so, he would find more and more beautiful areas and hidden passages.  He discovered blind cave fish (never before seen), huge gypsum caverns, and miles and miles of caves stretching under the land of Kentucky.  He even created maps of the areas he had found that helped others explore as well.  Though he died a short time after he was freed (at the young age of thirty-six), Bishop is remembered as being the first and most important guide of the impressive Mammoth Caves today.<br /><br />The story is, as Elizabeth Mitchell rightly says, captivating.  Cleverly, she has included Stephen's maps on the front and endpapers of the book.  Mitchell also tells the reader, right off the bat, that she has reproduced his life with as much accuracy as possible and that the dialogue, \\"is not reproduced from any source\\".  I commend Mitchell for her choice of subject.  Stephen Bishop, rightly, deserves to be remembered for his great life and magnificent accomplishments.  I personally believe, however, that an entirely factual book of this fellow would not have been out of place.  Consider similar books about other people who lived in the 1800s.  There is the book, \\"Phineas Gage\\", by John Fleischman.  Here we have a beautiful non-fiction text with color photographs and engravings that is the perfect way to tell the story of a 19th century life.  Think how wonderful, \\"Journey to the Bottomless Pit\\" would have been, had it been done in a similar format.  When you read this book, you hear about eyeless fish and beautiful stalactites.  Wouldn't it be great to see beautiful color photographs of them as well?  Instead, you must rely on illustrator Kelynn Alder's black and white drawings.  These pictures are nice, no question, but you can't help but wish that you could see the caves for yourself in a far more lively format.<br /><br />You might argue that good non-fiction subjects have been given a similar fictional treatment to Stephen Bishop and that those books have been good.  This is true, of course.  There's just one small problem.  Mitchell, for all that she is great at choosing the best details to highlight in her story, is not a good writer.  Her language is stilted and cloying.  Though the book is ostensibly written for kids between the ages of 9-12, the tone of voice taken here would be better for a seven-year-old reader.  Stephen constantly is describes as being grateful tohis master, proud that he has been chosen, and hoping that he'll do a good job.  The wry sense of humor that Stephen had is mentioned here, but Mitchell's not adept enough to give us a taste of it.  Worse, there are some truly unbelievable moments that are written solely to spell things out to child readers.  Take this for example: \\"When he first heard the name `Underground Railroad,' Stephen wondered what kind of train could run for so many miles below ground\\".  Mitchell doesn't seem to give Stephen much credit, and his abject gratitude and innocence makes him seem a very different person from the intelligent guide described by his contemporaries.  Had Mitchell been a talented enough writer to pull off the additional passages in this text, the book might have worked brilliantly.  As it stands, I yearn for the beautiful glossy-paged non-fiction text this could have been.<br /><br />Will kids read this book?  Not without some prodding.  It's a fine story and a good adventure tale at times, but children will only ask for this if urged to do so.  There is great potential in this material.  I can only hope that a future author sees it and capitalizes on it themselves.

Have you ever found yourself distraught that a book that you've come to love has not received the attention and aplomb it's so obviously worthy of?  Usually the books I review have been given enough accolades to keep me from feeling that they've been overlooked in some way, but upon reading, \\"How To Make a Night\\", I found myself severely disappointed with the world around me.  The library branch where I work has 2 copies of this book and they do not circulate half as quickly as I would like them to.  Why this is, I'm not sure.  Here we have a funny, charming, sweet little book about how one deals with a particularly bad day and no one's lauded it half as much as it deserves.  So laud I shall, loud and clear.<br /><br />The book begins with a brief overview of why the day was so bad.  \\"Bike blew a tire / Boat sprang a leak / Scooter's in the gutter / Sneaker's in the creek\\".  Throughout a cluttered, crazed, messy home, two shellshocked adults cling to the arms of their battered old armchair as children run haywire and cats cling to doorways.  Various limbs and heads stick out of the most unlikely of places.  Then, like a beacon in a mad mad world, a single girl steps atop a green chair, mop and bucket in hand.  \\"Time to settle down / Time to clean the mess / Time to bring the night around / so everyone can rest\\".  As she steps outside her window the world grows, if possible, even more surreal.  Our young heroine lets loose a rope into space, catches the sun, and pulls it down into her skirt pocket.  Then she darkens the sky, splatters some gold for stars, and creates the moon itself from a single smooth-rubbed stone.  Crickets and owls are called forth and, last but not least, the house is tidied and everyone has dinner and a bath.  In bed, the girl hugs her mother and father and snuggles to sleep.  But lest you think that's the end of that, the book concludes with a sly, \\"Close your eyes and slumber soundly / You'll be busy very soon / when it's time to toss the sun up high / and haul away the moon\\".<br /><br />I do not, personally, know any five-year-olds that I'm familiar enough with to buy them presents.  This is a good thing.  If I did know any I'd go broke buying each and every one of them a copy of this book for their own personal use.  I read a lot of children's books, being a children's librarian and all, but few of them hit me on such a personal level as this book.  How can I explain?  First of all, the words are great.  Author Linda Ashman (who, I'm ashamed to say, I never heard of prior to this book) adds just the right amounts of wit and silliness to this poetic jumble.  The words found here are outwardly simple, but they are particularly good at conjuring up original descriptors.  Long silver spoons, a night chorus, a big wet mop... these are all deeply satisfying objects and groupings to read about.  By the end of the tale, kids reading it will feel that they themselves could call down the sun and raise high the moon if they merely read this  book enough times to themselves.<br /><br />Tricia Tusa is the one I'm going to officially tip my hat to, though.  But before I do, I want to berate her a little.  Tricia, you've created illustrations that make everyone happy.  However, I think you chose the cover design poorly.  Hear me out.  For all the book's charms, the cover doesn't appeal.  It gives a misleading impression of an otherwise delightful tale.  Tsk tsk and tsk again.  That said, you're a genius.  I don't know if your kind readers have had the pleasure of seeing the recent picture book, \\"The Mighty Asparagus\\", but this book has a great many similarities to that amusing text.  The only difference is, this book is better.  When Tusa draws a chaotic scene, it stays chaotic.  And when she makes a snug bed feel safe, it stays safe.  Combining \\"normal\\" pen, ink, and watercolor illustrations with the insanity of mixed media catalog cut-outs, the book feels simultaneously familiar and exotic.  Here we see a sun withthe smiling lips and wet teeth of a somewhat mad 10-year-old.  The stars of the sky are haphazard yellow scribbles, while the underside of a blue sky is all geometric drawings and figures.  My words don't do these illustrations justice.  Ashman's words do.<br /><br />I declare, \\"How To Make a Night\\", the Most-Underappreciated-Picture-Book-Of-2004.  It will wow you and it will wow your children.  If you're looking for a picture book for the kiddies but you don't want to give them something dull or, for that matter, something they already own, make an effort to get them a copy of this puppy.

Parents nagging kids to wash their hands before eating.  Kids leaving their toys out for everyone to trip over.  Yadda yadda yadda.  The nice thing about kids, though, is that as the world around them changes, they often adapt perfectly.  Consequently, the things parents nag them about change as well.  When I was a kid (and I am now 27) my mother would tell me to stop playing video games on my Commodore 64 and go outside to get some fresh air.  20 some odd years later, parents are still yelling at their kids to do the same dang thing.  It's a whole new childhood staple.  In \\"Lucky Leaf\\" our protagonist goes head to head with nature, triumphs, then immediately rushes back to his indoor world.  It makes for an amusing picture book.<br /><br />Told entirely in the form of a cartoon (complete with speech bubbles) our young hero begins the book by coming within a hair's breath of beating the near impossible level 20 on his video game.  His mother, hearing his joy, abruptly puts an end to it by telling him to go play outside (his reply that he is, in fact, playing goes ignored).  With much grumbling he does so, meeting up with two other friends who have been similarly thrown from their own homes.  While under a tree they see a single orange leaf poised to blow away at the top of a tree.  As everyone knows, the last leaf on a tree is a lucky one. \\"But only if you can catch it\\".  The rest of the book consists of our hero attempting to outsmart the stubborn foliage, whether by hiding behind a tree or under a pile of its fellows.  By the end, the leaf is caught and our hero's luck is put to good kid-sized use.<br /><br />It's not exactly the deepest picture book out there, but for any parent who has ever had to virtually pick their young `un up by the belt and fling them into nature, this book will feel eerily familiar.  Usually in books of this era, the hero would learn about nature and return indoors at last to eschew the lure of video games forevermore.  And how realistic would that ending be, anyway?  Here, the kid meets nature, has a fine time, then returns to what he really wants to do.  Beat level 20!<br /><br />The colors in this tale are fully autumnal.  If you're looking for some kind of a fall related picture book, I can think of few better than this, visually.  But just as the book is about a video related subject, so too are the pictures best attributed to the world of the computer.  I took a quick glance at the title page and saw that these colors were actually the result of clever PhotoShopping.  So much for paint.  Still, I enjoyed watching the squirrels in these pages.  For a fun time, compare the endpapers at the beginning of the book to the ones at the end.<br /><br />As fall picture books go, this one's so so.  Some people will swear by it.  Others, like myself, will notice that there's just not much of a plot here.  The book won't age particularly well, since the gaming console the boy holds will undoubtedly be out of date in less than 5 years.

Does it mean that when you attend cocktail parties with a chosen circle of friends you're able to whip out a series of timely bon mots?  Does it mean that you have the ability to finish every Sunday crossword puzzle that appears in the New York Times?  Or does it, perhaps, mean that you use the full range of your brain at all times, thereby saving yourself from harm in the long run?  My vote is for the last.  And, as the delightful \\"Mabela the Clever\\" by Margaret Read MacDonald concurs, not much more need be said on the subject.<br /><br />Says the book from the start, \\"In the early times, some were clever and some were foolish.  The Cat was one of the clever ones.  The mice were mostly foolish\\".  Mostly.  There are exceptions to every rule and in this case the exception is named Mabela.  Mabela comes from a loving family, one that has given her much good advice in the past.  Says her father to her, one should always keep their ears open to listen, their eyes open to see, pay attention to everything you say, and \\"if you have to move, MOVE FAST!\\".  A sweet little red mouse, Mabela finds use for this parcel of wisdom when a large charming orange pussycat persuades the mice to learn all the secrets of the cat.  To do so, they need only walk in a line with the cat in the rear, singing, \\"When we are marching, we never look back! The cat is at the end! Fo Feng! Fo Feng!\\".  It's Mabela who realizes, at the front of this line, that something is amiss.  Especially when the voices of the others behind her becomes softer.... and softer...<br /><br />Fear not, little children.  Though I'm sure that the original folktale of this story had the cat eat every one of the foolish mousies, it does not do so here.  Instead, the cat wears a red bag on its back, into which it scoops and drops each mouse that it hopes to eat later.  Fortunately for all (except the cat) Mabela intercedes.  In her Author's Note at the beginning of the book, acclaimed storyteller extraordinaire, Margaret Read MacDonald, explains that she adapted this tale from one found originally in Sierra Leone.

I should have been a consumer's  advocate.  This thought came to me when, after having checked out Laura Vaccaro Seeger's, \\"Lemons Are Not Red\\" from the library, I found myself pressing my oily fingers into the solid colored pages of her book.  I was doing this so that I could mention in my review that this book, while interesting and lovely to the eye, was not ideal for toddlers since sticky hands would leave a continual residue.  Trouble is, Seeger's smarter than I am.  Her pages never show fingerprints.  Not even the all-black two-page spreads.  Whether it's the type of paper used or something to do with the treatment of the colors, I cannot say.  All I can do is tip my hat to her and say that like all her other books, \\"Lemons Are Not Red\\" is infinitely appropriate and approachable for many a child of many a persuasion.<br /><br />This is one of those rare picture books that set before you a series of statements, all in the negative.  The first sentence is the same as that found in the title.  As we look at two pages of bright yellow paper, small black words proclaim, \\"Lemons are not RED\\".  The word \\"RED\\" appears under a cut-out made in the paper, through which we appear to see a red lemon.  Turn the page though and the cut-out moves onto one of the yellow pages from the previous spread.  The red background lets the lemon pop out at you to the accompanying words of, \\"Lemons are YELLOW.  Apples are RED\\".  And there, facing the lemon, is a shiny plump apple.  This goes on.  We learn various truths.  Flamingoes are not gray.  Grass is not blue.  Reindeer are not white (albino reindeer notwithstanding).  Finally, at the end, the moon is not black.  The night is black.  And inside a house stand two little figures, that turn into a tree as you turn the page.<br /><br />Though lacking the narrative of that similarly ingenious cut-out picture book, \\"Go Away, Big Green Monster\\", this has a lot to recommend it.  Now I began this review by commending Seeger for her fingerprint-proof paper.  Unfortunately, that paper is not rip proof as well.  In fact, as I was flipping idly through this puppy at home I found that the delicate cut-outs of things like reindeer and carrots are very prone to huge tears (not by my hands, I assure you).  So my advice is to give this to a child that, even if grubby handed, knows how to treat a book respectfully.<br /><br />All in all, this is a lovely little book of colors, shapes, and definitions.  It's not my favorite cut-out book out there, and it doesn't hold up to subsequent readings all that well, but I loved the art and I like the narrative.  Two thumbs up for a pretty darn good Seeger creation.s review by commending Seeger for her fingerprint-proof paper.  Unfortunately, that paper is not rip proof as well.

Younger Readers (Awards))	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Next time won't you sing with me?	When I conjure up the name Lisa Campbell Ernst, what instantly pops into my head is not a stark yet colorful alphabet book.  This is the author/illustrator that brought us such memorable classics as, \\"Stella Louella's Runaway Book\\", and \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\".  She has a bubbly cartoony style that I never seriously thought she'd break away from.  But break away she has (and how) in this somewhat Laura Vaccaro Seeger-inspired, \\"Turn-Around Upside-Down Alphabet Book\\".  Apart from being a bit of a mouthful, the book is an inventive take on teaching kids new ways to examine individual letter.  And though it bears an uncanny similarity to Seeger's, \\"The Hidden Alphabet\\", Ernst's imbued it with enough wit and style to make it stand entirely on its own.<br /><br />Now to read this book you better be prepared to do exactly as the title suggests.  With each letter we see four different ways to view each letter.  Turn the letter \\"A\\" one way and it's a bird's beak.  Turn it another and it's a drippy ice cream cone.  Placing her color contrasting letters in meticulously crafted positions, Ernst is able to draw the most remarkable images from her illustrations.  At her best, she does amazing things with difficult letters.  I was especially impressed with the \\"magic wand casting a spell\\" that came from her elegant letter \\"G\\".  Ditto the \\"M\\"'s, \\"two fish playing chase\\".  Ernst isn't afraid to stretch her images from time to time, however.  The \\"point of a wishing star\\" that's supposed to come from an angled \\"A\\" is sketchy at best.  Ditto the \\"mama duck and her two little ducklings\\" that springs from an inverted \\"K\\".<br /><br />Another disadvantage to this book comes from the black borders that surround some of the letters.  \\"The Hidden Alphabet\\" by Seeger is similar in layout to this book, but has thick black borders that never show the residue of oily fingertips.  \\"The Turn-Around Upside-Down Alphabet Book\\" doesn't have this advantage.  If you touch a page, that page stays touched.  And considering that this is a book that is going to enjoy multiple repeated touchings, this works to its disadvantage.  I know Ernst isn't to blame here, but for her sake I wish the publisher could've found a better black border substance to withstand the grubby prints of little fingers.  After two readings, this book will show its age.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's lovely.  A fun way to get kids interested in the alphabet and nice eye-twisting almost optical illusionary twist on a tried and true form.  As alphabet books go, it's fine n' dandy.  Not the most inventive out there, but certainly not the least.  For Ernst fans, it marks quite a departure.  For people who've never encountered her work before, it's a lovely introduction.s touched.

Scott Fitzgerald's, \\"The Great Gatsby\\", but I have my reasons.  Hear me out.  If you'll recall, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is about an incorrigible attention seeker (Gatsby) who's adventures are recorded by his faithful friend Nick Carraway.  Everyone remembers Gatsby when they read the book.  Few remember Nick.  Now consider the fabulous, \\"Fudge\\" series.  In some ways, it's the same thing.  Our narrator is the constantly put-upon older brother Peter Hatcher.  Pete's a perfect foil for his little brother, the irrepressible \\"Fudge\\" Farley Drexel Hatcher.  And when you finish reading one of these books, what character do you end up remembering with crystal clear clarity?  That's right.  It's Fudge.  Poor Peter not only has to deal with a little brother that's more of an attention hog than himself, he also has to deal with one that readers will remember better too.<br /><br />In this particular Hatcher adventure, the family is going up to Maine for a couple weeks in the summer.  Unfortunately for Peter, his bitter enemy the snobby Sheila Tubman's going to be there too.  Worse still, Fudge has decided that he's going to marry Sheila.  Peter's against this idea, and finds once they get to Maine that the situation is even direr than he first thought.  Not only is Sheila there but she's basically sharing the house with Peter and his family.  If he can only get his best friend Jimmy Fargo to come and stay with him, everything may turn out all right.  Otherwise, he may have to deal with blueberry emergencies, Monster Spray, missing pet birds, and a serious first crush all on his own.  It's gonna be a heckuva summer.<br /><br />Blume has nicely aged her characters in this series, wisely deciding that a Fudge that grows up is far more interesting than a Fudge that stays 3-years-old all the time.  So 5-year-old Fudge, while certainly an older version of the original little troublemaker, is definitely still the same kid.  The book also marks Peter's foray into early adolescence.  He develops a crush on a local teenager and has to deal with hiding the fact from his friends.  And, this being Judy Blume, there are some amusingly suggestive sections that will fly right over kids' heads while creating knowing smiles in adult readers.<br /><br />I believe that, \\"Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing\\" will always be the best Blume book ever conceived.  But with witty sequels like, \\"Fudge-a-mania\\", I have few fears that Fudge's success will ever change him in a significant way.  So let's raise a toast to a fine fun series.  And let's not forget the importance of Peter too.  Though he may just be the narrator, you just couldn't read about Fudge without him.me kid.

When I read a Leon Garfield book, I suddenly have the impression that I've done something noble and great for the cause of humanity.  He feels like my own personal children's author.  The kind that I discovered all on my own and that, as one of the best kept secrets in kiddie lit, I don't necessarily want anyone else to know about.  Then I come to my senses, sigh, and write a review like this one.  Ever since I discovered his brilliant Dickensian, \\"Smith\\", I've been meaning to work my way through the Garfield oeuvre.  \\"Black Jack\\" was second on my reading list and, now that I've read it through, it has become my favorite book by this author.  If you've a child that's been enraptured by books like, \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\" or even, \\"The Wolves of Willoughby Chase\\", then you'd be committing a serious crime to omit from your reading list this most enjoyable of high Victorian adventures.<br /><br />When a set of unlikely circumstances end with young Bartholomew Dorking guarding the coffin of the recently hanged villain Black Jack, the boy is less than delighted.  An apprentice to a draper, Tolly has always led an upstanding pious life.  Next thing he knows, however, the recently hanged Black Jack (the kind of man described here as, \\"a mighty fellow, and rough... as if the Almighty had sketched him out (and left the Devil to fill him in) before He'd settled on something of a quieter, more genteel size\\") is not as dead as he first appeared.  In fact, he is very much alive.  Taking Tolly with him wherever he goes, the boy finds himself the unwitting accomplice to this most dark-hearted of villains.  In the course of their adventures they meet madwomen, frauds, fortune tellers, and sailors.  And while Tolly finds true love in the most unlikely of places, Black Jack learns how to use his enormous strength for something other than villainy.<br /><br />The book is a highly satisfying read.  Part of this is due to the characters Garfield's conjured up.  Tolly is fourteen and your typical heroic orphan.  The kind of lad that Oliver Twist could've grown up to be (if Oliver was a little less saintly and little more human).  His eventual lady love, one Miss Belle Carter, begins the book as mad but eventually is seen to be just a gal who suffered a severe shock in her youth and has needed to recover from it ever since.  But the true hero of this tale is the title character.  Black Jack's one in a million.  He's so real that you can practically feel his villainy emanating off the pages that describe him.  At the same time, there are chinks in his personality that allow you to understand why Tolly feels he must earn Jack's respect, even as he hates and fears him.  Jack has his weaknesses as well.  He fears madness above all things and he's often rather disconcerted when he observes Tolly doing the right thing in the face of what's easy.  By the end of the book you'll find yourself cheering Jack and Tolly on and wishing that Mr. Leon Garfield had had the inclination to make several sequels of their adventures to accompany this marvelous tale.<br /><br />So there you have it.  A children's book for everyone to enjoy.  You like descriptions?  Then take a gander at passages like: \\"(She was) a happy, greasy, jingly lady whose skin was always aglitter with fine brass dust so that she had the air of being a worn but once costly Christmas present\\".  You like a riveting story?  By the second half of this book you'll be disinclined to set it down for even half a breath.  You can't read a book unless the characters are likable?  Even Tolly is a great guy to root for, and HE'S the saintly hero!  Some people pooh-pooh Garfield as a lesser Dickens.  I prefer to think of him as the logical step kids need between their everyday literature and real Dickens.  If you want your child to pick up \\"Nicholas Nickleby\\" for fun, don't immediately ungulf them in that text first.  Start them out slowly with a little Leon Garfield.  With any luck, they'll be howling for more things along that vein.  But don't relegate Garfield simply to the ranks of second-rate Dickens.  He's an artist in his own right and his books are well worth discovering.  You'll love it.  I promise.text first.  Start them out slowly with a little Leon Garfield.

One minute he's meticulously cutting out brightly colored slips of paper to resemble rodentia as in, \\"Seven Blind Mice\\".  The next he's dallying with pastels in the less remarkable, \\"Turkey Girl\\".  Sometimes his books are astounding to the eye and ear and sometimes they test even the most die-hard of his fans.  Veering in a completely new direction, Young's, \\"The Sons of the Dragon King\\", utilizes brush and ink (as well as his familiar cut paper style) to bring us a classic Chinese tale of nine brothers and the ways in which their father put their skills to use.  It's not exactly the kind of story tots are going to expect with a title that includes the words, \\"Dragon King\\", but for some collections it will serve as a lovely addition.<br /><br />There was once a Dragon King who had nine sons.  The king sent his sons off to find their place in the world and, for a time, everything was hunky-dory.  However, soon rumors start to circulate about each of the sons.  Servants, who apparently have no qualms about downplaying a prince to his father, let the king know of the sons' individual flaws.  For example, the first son seems to do nothing all day but challenge peasants to feats of strength.  The Dragon King is inclined to punish his son, but then decides that perhaps he can use that strength to a better end.  Hence, now many large columns in China are supported by images of this dragon son.  The second son just sits on the roof all day, staring into nothingness.  Again, the king thinks he should punish, but at last decides that his son's watchfulness can also be helpful.  Hence, many Chinese buildings sport images of this son on the tops of their buildings, watching for danger.  You get the picture.  The third son is loud (so he's now on instruments).  The fourth son is just (so he appears above prison doors).  And so on and so forth.  The tale ends with the father having found adequate placement for each dragon son and a contentment in the knowledge that all is right with the world.<br /><br />I'm all about fairy tales that show individuals using their unique talents to work towards some common goal.  So I was a little shocked to reach the end of this tale and find that the story, such as it was, was just a counting down of each son to his individual calling.  They never band together to defeat a single enemy.  They don't even know of one another.  Basing this tale on a classic Chinese legend, Young has certainly given this tale a classy package.  For the first time in my recollection, he's almost traipsed into the world of cartoon.  His dragons (which are sometimes so sketchy that kids obsessed with the literal will find them a tad disheartening) can be silly, meticulous, and fierce.  The inks used here look both classic and completely contemporary.  As for the cut paper, I'm not entirely certain how Young managed to take out every tiny sliver required for his sidebars.  I'm just glad he did.<br /><br />That said, the book's not going to attract a wide audience.  It's a nice tale, but there aren't enough pictures of the dragons for little kids and not enough story for older ones.  The inked dragons are fabulous looking, yes, but they're not visually appealing to little kids.  Older kids, the kinds that still read picture books but don't need tons of stories, will want to hear more than a tale of \\"brother _____ could _____ so now he ______\\".  Also, I was disappointed to find that while Young is careful to include a nicely in-depth Author's Note and stamp for each brother, he has not included any words in Chinese aside from the brothers' names.  But that's more of a personal choice than a real critique.<br /><br />In the end, this is a grand story of a father accepting his sons and finding acceptable ways for them to come to the aid of humanity.  It suggests that all parents that find their children to be different from what they originally wanted should attempt to be as open-minded as the infinitelywise Dragon King.  I liked that part of the book.  I just feel that this is a book for adults that like picture books.  Not one for kids that like dragons.  A beautiful creation in a peculiar presentation.infinitely wise Dragon King.  I liked that part of the book.  I just feel that this is a book for adults that like picture books.

235404:US	49148452	R1S9KFVDW227B0	0689851324	81726732	Homecoming (The Tillerman Series #1)	Books	5	85	87	N	N	Just can't wait to be on that road again	When I decided to suddenly try to read as many different kinds of children's books out there, I had no idea what I was getting myself into.  Suddenly I was discovering a multitude of different staples, awards, experts, critiques, and controversies.  Perhaps most surprising to me, however, were those books that I was somewhat familiar with, but not actually fluent in.  Cynthia Voigt's Tillerman saga is a collection of some seven books about a single variegated family.  The series is considered by some to be a masterpiece.  So I decided that the time had come to finally give these books a try.  Of course, the first book in the saga, \\"Homecoming\\" is daunting.  It's a work of realistic fiction filling about 402 pages.  Hardly light reading.  I started it with some reluctance.  Then I found myself completely unable to stop until I'd reached the end.  This is one of the best books I've ever had the pleasure to read.  I only wish that had been obvious from the outset.<br /><br />It sounds like the headline of a tabloid newspaper:  Mother Abandons Children In Mall Parking Lot.  But for the Tillerman children, Dicey James, Maybeth, and Sammy, their situation is horribly real.  Their mother has abandoned them without explanation or even so much as a goodbye.  Dicey, the thirteen-year-old eldest of the kids, thinks the situation through.  They have a little money and they know where their only known relative, a rich aunt, lives.  If they go to the police they may be separated from one another and placed in foster homes.  If they make it to the aunt's house, however, they might be able to stay together.  It's a risk considering the distance they must travel and the dangers along the way, but Dicey has faith in their mission.  The book is split into two portions.  In the first, the kids make their way to their aunt.  In the second, they've discovered they have a grandmother and find themselves on the road once more.<br /><br />Now I have a confession to make here.  When I started to read this book some four days ago, it was not the first time I'd attempted to make it through, \\"Homecoming\\".  When I was a kid my literary aunt made me a present of this self same title.  I was about 9 or 10 and though I gave the book a once over, I never got into it.  Sure, there were things I liked about it.  I loved the idea of four kids making it on their own without any adult supervision.  Heck, that's one of the biggest child fantasies out there.  Why do you think so many children's book heroes and heroines are orphans?  Without parents about, kids are free to do as they choose, no matter how foolish and stupid those things might be.  But the thing about the Tillermans is that they don't want to be in that position.  Not in the least.  From the moment their mother abandons them, they hate that they're alone.  Each child has a different cross to bear as well.  Sammy, the youngest, has grown stubborn and spoiled from having to deal with their mother's mental illness.  Maybeth, a little older, has dealt with their lot differently.  She rarely speaks to anyone but her immediately family and is seen as mentally challenged by adults.  James is incredibly intelligent but angry at the world.  How he deals with the injustices he sees is sometimes wise, sometimes incredibly dumb.  Dicey, for the most part, is the strongest of them all.  If she has a flaw it's that she's almost too protective of her little siblings.  What Dicey finds she likes most to do is sail boats.  It's the passion for doing something while thinking of nothing that draws her.<br /><br />Voigt is especially good at complex human beings.  There are no villains in this book (with the exception of an amazingly creepy farmer that threatens the kids at one point).  Otherwise, people are a mixed bag of emotions and intentions.  The kids' cousin Eunice, who takes them in at one point, isn't a bad person.  She's just weak and silly.  I fully expected the book to demonize those adults that had intentionstowards the children different from the children's own, but this was not the case.  Whether you're reading about the dog handler of a traveling circus or a severe nun, each person in this book could be made out of actual flesh and blood they're so real.  Really, the book is a children's answer to \\"On the Road\\".  And it's a breath-taking journey to find a place to call home.<br /><br />So it's 402 pages.  If you can get a kid to read the first 2 chapters, I bet a wad o' cash that they'll be hooked.  I haven't read a children's book quite this amazing in quite some time.  Now it'll be all anyone can do to keep me from reading the entire saga straight through without cease.

When you review a picture book you have a responsibility to two kinds of consumers: The parents who buy the books and the children who read them.  Now when I was a kid you probably could've handed me junky handwritten papers illustrated in crayon and I would've loved them.  Children know what they do and do not like and it is the responsibility of their parents to choose well-written worthwhile books that will stand the test of time for their youngsters' brains.  However, at the same time you don't want to be the kind of parent who only gets books for your kids that are \\"good' for them.  I see these kinds of adults all the time.  Unfortunate children are dragged to my library and forced to read books like \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" and \\"Treasure Island\\" which, while good, aren't the kinds of books that reluctant readers are instantly going to gravitate towards.  The same goes for picture books.  Sometimes I'll recommend a picture book that children may initially find dull or confusing simply because it's either a work of art or so well-written that I'm sure the children will grow to love it.  Which brings me, in a definitely roundabout way, to \\"John Coltrane's Giant Steps\\".  This is a book that undoubtedly seemed like a good idea when it was thought up.  I mean, what could be cooler?  You take a John Coltrane song and then using artist Chris Raschka's remarkable watercolor and inks show the song as a visual piece of work.  The idea is sublime.  The result is deathly dull and confusing for kids.<br /><br />If you are not familiar with \\"Giant Steps\\" the song, you may wish to listen to it as you read this book.  The book begins with the words, \\"Good evening.  And thank you for coming to our book.  We have something very special for you tonight.  It's John Coltrane's marvelous and tricky composition `Giant Steps,' performed for you by a box, a snowflake, some raindrops, and a kitten.  Why not stay and see it?\\".  Why not indeed.

When you think of lift-the-flap-books, you may find yourself imagining those remarkably simple (not to say stupefyingly dull) \\"Spot\\" books or some other such dribble.  Books that, while perfectly good, aren't exactly going to challenge wee ones' brains too too much.  When you think of alphabet books, the mind turns to books where each page displays a letter with some object that begins with that letter.  Ho hum, you say?  Not a bit of it.  \\"The Hidden Alphabet\\" has combined two overdone and usually shoddily produced picture book staples to create what may arguably be THE most beautiful alphabet book ever designed.  Whether or not children will like the book for its flaps or its pictures remains to be seen.  What is unquestionable, however, is its inherently gorgeous layout.<br /><br />The book is remarkably thick.  Probably one of the thickest picture books I've ever had the pleasure of playing with.  When you open it up you see two pages with deep black paper.  A small square has been cut out on each page, behind which is an image.  Underneath the cutout is a word describing that image.  For example, the first two pages show an \\"arrowhead\\" and some \\"balloons\\".  Now lift the flap.  Behind the first page the arrowhead becomes the center of a marbelized A.  Behind the second flap the balloons are the holes in a deep blue B.  Now on occasion Amazon.com will allow you to search inside the book and look at some of the pictures.  Sadly, you cannot do that here.  If you could, you would possibly be able to see some of the cleverer switches.  Multiple pointy mouse heads poke inwards to reveal an M.  Nails lying askew morph into a lovely N.  The book offers no commentary or explanation.  This is simply a way to make exploring the alphabet a fun and beautiful experience.<br /><br />For parents of the sticky-fingered set, I am happy to report that the pages in this book are thick and durable.  This isn't to say that a highly dedicated tot couldn't rip an L or a Z out if he or she really wanted to.  It just cuts down on the number of potential accidents, is all.  Also (and I credit the publisher with this one) fingerprints don't show up on the black pages.  Kudos there.  All in all, this is a gorgeous piece of work.  One of the finest (if not THE finest) alphabetic jaunts to grace library and bookshelves nationwide.  If you'd like to make a gift of an alphabet book to someone, but you don't want to feel cheap, \\"The Hidden Alphabet\\" is the lushest of its kind.  Recommended in spades.he or she really wanted to.  It just cuts down on the number of potential accidents, is all.

240526:US	49148452	RFUHJCOCNBD14	068984851X	464960378	The Voyage of Patience Goodspeed	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Call me Patience	I consider myself quite the reader of children's books.  I devour the puppies with a great deal of relish and smacking of the lips, but there are some genres of kiddie lit that I simply do not know a whole lot about.  Like children's historical novels that are about whaling.  Honestly, if you were to sit me down in a small darkened room with a single light bulb over my head and a piece of paper before me reading, \\"List every children's novel ever written about whaling or a life at sea\\", I'd be up a creek.  I picked up, \\"The Voyage of Patience Goodspeed\\", on a lark and found that this was one of the first books of this kind I'd ever encountered.  Now, normally a tale of a child on a whaling vessel would contain a male protagonist or, alternatively, a girl protagonist disguised as a boy.  Author Heather Vogel Frederick has taken an entirely different tack, however.  In this book you see the world of seafaring through the eyes of a typical New England twelve-year-old.  And while this is not the best written work of historical fiction ever conceived, you can tell that Frederick's heart and soul went into this puppy.<br /><br />Patience Goodspeed is not happy.  Not happy at all.  It was bad enough that her mother died only a few months ago.  It was bad enough that her father, the captain of a whaling vessel, was gone during that time and has only just returned.  And it's bad enough that he's now so awash in misery and depression that he hardly pays attention to his brood.  But now, suddenly, Captain Goodspeed has decided that Patience and her little brother Thaddeus are to accompany him on his next three-year voyage at sea.  This jars violently with Patience's own plans to stay in Nantucket and learn under the tutelage of the fabulous teacher Maria Mitchell.  But when you're a girl living in the 1830s, there's not a lot you can do to prevent yourself from doing what those around you think is best.  So off Thaddeus and Patience go on their father's magnificent Morning Star.  On their voyage they will encounter frightening storms, magnificent hunts for whales, death, fair sailing, boredom, mutiny, and celebration.  And Patience discovers that her skills in mathematics have a practical application in the world of navigation and sailing as well.<br /><br />First of all, kudos to author Frederick for giving us a female protagonist who's good at math.  Girls are often fabulous at this skill (myself excluded) but it's rare that you see a math whiz in a work of children's fiction.  So well done there.  As for the book itself, it's pretty good.  I'm inclined to describe it as a kind of a \\"Moby Dick\\" for kids.  Unfortunately, when I say that I mean it fully.  Like Herman Melville's classic, this book contains quite a bit of dull ship information that has a tendency to slog down the action.  Consider, for examples, sentences like, \\"Directly opposite, on the larboard or port side, is my boat.  In front of it is the waistboat, which belongs to Mr. Chase\\".  Fortunately, Frederick includes a glossary of whaling terms at the back of her book.  She also doesn't rely on such passages too often, which is a relief.<br /><br />The writing itself is rather good too.  You understand Patience's anger right at the start (though after seeing what she and her brother go through you still have to question their father's sanity in bringing them along).  Thaddeus, unfortunately, is prone to falling out of windows and getting into typical \\"adorable child\\" type mischief.  He, I could have lived without.  And I did find it a little difficult to suspend my disbelief when Patience and Thaddeus ran afoul of some of the sailors aboard their father's ship.  How believable is it that these kids would live in fear of two scalywags when their father is the freakin' ship's captain?  Finally, I found it a little odd that Captain Goodspeed was just so doggone.... good.  I mean, we're talking about a captain of a whaling vessel.  Though brief mention is made of men being whipped with a cat o' nine tails, no one in this book ever is (including the mutineering jackanapes once caught).  This is fairly hard to believe.  I can only assume that Frederick left out such passages so that the captain would remain unambiguously good rather than a complex character.  More's the pity.<br /><br />How interesting will kids find the world of whaling in this day and age?  Fairly, I think.  Despite the occasional dead patch, Frederick's first children's book (for so this art) is a lovely little work.  In fact, I was saddened by the lack of a bibliography at its end.  Each chapter begins with a lovely passage about whaling or sailing from a variety of different texts.  A collection at the book's end of the full names and authors of those texts would not have been out of place.  Here's hoping that in future Patience Goodspeed books such an action will be taken.  Otherwise, I do feel that whether you've a boy reader or a girl reader on your hands, \\"The Voyage of Patience Goodspeed\\" will remain a crowd pleaser, regardless of gender.  It has an occasional slip here and there, but all in all it's a good egg.  Recommended indeed.being whipped with a cat o' nine tails, no one in this book ever is (including the mutineering jackanapes once caught).  This is fairly hard to believe.

A parent was speaking to me the other day in my library (I'm a children's librarian, you see) and she wanted some nice picture books on dogs for her child.  Naturally my mind jumped to such modern day classics as Bob Graham's, \\"Let's Get a Pup, Said Kate\\".  \\"No\\", the parent said.  \\"Something about a real dog\\".  That's a significantly more difficult request.  Right off the top of my head I had a hard time thinking up any seriously well-written non-fiction doggish titles.  We scanned the 636.7's, when my eye alighted on a very new book indeed.  I suggested, \\"Hachiko: The True Story of a Loyal Dog\\" without hesitation.  After all, it had appeared on the New York Public Library's list of the great children's books of 2004.  However, when I described the plot the patron pooh-poohed it as \\"depressing\\".  And since I had not actually read the book myself, I was powerless to disagree.  Now I come back to \\"Hachiko\\", having read it at long last, and I'm mighty sad that I wasn't able to defend it to the dog-seeking patron.  Though containing sad elements, the book is a loving testament to one canine's love for his master.<br /><br />Our hero is Hachiko, a large Akita dog that was owned and loved by its master, Dr. Ueno.  Through the eyes of a small boy we see the dog return to the railroad station every day to wait for Dr. Ueno when he steps off the train from work.  The boy loves the dog but is content to simply pet and hug it at the station.  One day, the boy hears terrible news.  Dr. Ueno has passed away, and naturally the boy's first question is, \\"What will happen to Hachiko?\\".  Some kind relatives attempt to take the dog in, but to their surprise Hachiko continues to wait at the station every day for his lost master.  For almost ten years, faithful Hachiko would wait for Dr. Ueno to come home.  No one knows the dog's motivation, or if it really understood what it was waiting for.  After its death, however, the people of the town raised the money to create a large bronze statue of the pup in its honor.  A replica of that statue stands in the Shibuya Station of Tokyo to this day.<br /><br />Okay, so maybe the whole idea of a dog waiting for its master to come home for years and years, not realizing that he's dead, is sad.  But it's also the perfect material for a children's picture book.  Not surprisingly, his tale was co-opted not only for this book but also for the slightly older reader, \\"Hachiko Waits\\" by Leslea Newman.  But how well does it work here?  First, I was surprised that it was categorized as non-fiction.  Though the tale of the dog is true, the aspect of the boy who interacts with him was made up for the purpose of the story.  The book is a bit sparse and formal as well.  Long blocks of text will run on one page while the facing page shows a large full-page illustration or just a little picture with a sentence.  This means that kids will probably have to have this book read to them, rather than the other way around.  I could've enjoyed a more creative layout here.  Fortunately, Yan Nascimbene's illustrations are lovely.  Hachiko himself, oddly, looks a bit stiff for a hero.  But the cherry blossoms, darkening evening scenes, and general feel is beautiful to the eye.  It may be a little formal for a children's picture book, but no one can argue with its attractive qualities.<br /><br />In a way, I don't blame the mother who wasn't inclined towardds the book.  The audience for, \\"Hachiko\\" is a select one.  But it truly is a lovely story, and one that I hope many kids will get a chance to hear at some point in their lives.

In this post-modern day and age, it's sometimes difficult to go back and read old classic fairy tales without looking at them with an overly-critical eye.  Take, for example, the case of the little red hen.  When I think of the little red hen my mind instantly jumps, for better or for worse, to Jon Scieszka's, \\"The Stinky Cheese Man: And Other Fairly Stupid Tales\\".  If you've read it then you'll know which passage instantly jumps to mind.  In the book, the little red hen launches an overwrought diatribe about how she and she alone has done all the work in baking some bread.  Her voice rises to a self-righteous shriek, the like of which has remained embedded in my little brain ever since.  It takes a real work of art to unlodge such a shriek.  Fortunately, author/illustrator Margot Zemach is such an  artist.<br /><br />The book displays the original tale without so much as a word awry.  A little red hen wishes to make some bread.  For each task in the making she asks for help from a goose, a cat, and a pig.  When such help is not forthcoming, she makes do on her own.  Then, at the end, when she utters those magical words, \\"Who will help me EAT the bread?\\", her friends miraculously find that this is just the kind of task they'd like to aid in.  However, the hen denies them this pleasure, pointing out (not unfairly) that she did all the work.  She then shares the food with her brood, who did help all along.<br /><br />If you need a version to tell your kids that is the universally recognized version, this is a good book to consult.  But Zemach avoids a potential pitfall that could've swamped her effort.  In some versions of this tale, the hen's final speech is delivered in this self-righteous glow of satisfaction (the kind of thing Sciszka would make fun of in the aforementioned, \\"Stinky Cheese Man\\").  Here, Zemach has tempered that emotion.  In her illustrations, the hen is a cheerful matron with her offspring helping when they can.  The goose, cat, and pig are nattily dressed.  The goose sports a pattered shawl and bonnet.  The cat wears a boatsman's straw hat, sometimes a vest, and sometimes suspenders.  The pig also wears a vest, but on his head he doffs a silk top hat.  Together, the three engage in a variety of occupations (most of which involve cards at a card table).  I've noticed that in other versions of this tale (versions that were almost certainly inspired by Zemach), the lazy animals almost always play cards.  It must be some universal symbol of idleness.  And at the end, when the hen delivers her final words, she speaks to the three bumpkins with a sweet cheery expression on her face.  She's not above enjoying her moment of triumph, but neither does she rub it in.<br /><br />Versions of this book published today sometimes end with the hen sharing her food with the three lagabouts anyway, thereby squashing the point of the story (but helping the goose, cat, and pig's self-esteem).  Oog.  Give me Zemach's original tale any day over such modern \\"improvements\\".  It's very satisfying for kids to see a character struggle, overcome her problems, and then deny her false friends any reward.  Does it speak to our baser instincts?  Of course!  That's the joy of it!  So if you'd like to get your kid grounded in one of the best fairy tales ever concocted, seriously consider the Margot Zemach edition of that fine and fabulous, \\"Little Red Hen\\".nattily dressed.

With stunning regularity, the like of which I could have never have hoped to predict, I (as a children's librarian in New York City) have been approached more times than I'd care to recall by eight-year-old girls desperately wanting good vampire fiction.  I kid you not.  And, to be perfectly frank, this is a segment of the population showing a great need but without anything to fill that void.  Oh sure, I can recommend James Howe's, \\"Bunnicula\\" until the cows come home, but vampire rabbits aren't what the ladies look for.  And at eight I'm loathe to lower myself by mentioning Anne Rice's name.  Thank goodness we've Elizabeth Levy instead.  Now I'm not going to say that, \\"Vampire State Building\\" is the greatest book ever written.  Quite frankly, it's repetitive and not particularly well thought out at times.  Just the same, though it obviously owes quite a bit to the aforementioned James Howe, the book is an amusing mystery for young readers that have just grown comfortable reading chapter books on their own, but still need the occasional picture and potentially spooky premise to help them along.<br /><br />The perils of online chatrooms are no stranger to anyone.  But who would've thought that chess-loving Robert would've come into direct contact with a vampire because of it?  At least that's what Robert's little brother Sam and cousin Mabel think has occurred.  Vlad Clinciu is a Romanian chess wiz, and over the last few months he's been enjoying playing (and mostly beating) Robert.  When a huge chess tournament is announced in New York, Robert discovers that Vlad's coming to visit.  But why is it that Vlad has such pointy incisors?  Why does he avoid garlic bagels?  And what's the gigantic secret he's been hiding from Robert all this time?  By the time the tournament is over, it's clear that there may be more to sweet Vlad than anyone really suspected.<br /><br />The book is a step up from such similar kids-in-a-mystery-having-fun series like \\"The Magic Schoolhouse\\" or the \\"Droon\\" chronicles.  Levy's writing, while not about to blow anyone away with its wit and wisdom, has enough jolts of cleverness to get one's attention.  For example, when Robert shows Vlad his living breathing gerbil and his once living and now stuff gerbil, their names are Terminator and Exterminator.  You can guess which is which.  The plot is interesting without ever becoming scary.  And I was intrigued by the relationships between the characters.  Sadly, the girls in this book don't break out of the broadest of stereotypical devices (shopping seems to be their number one concern).  Otherwise, all is well.<br /><br />If a child runs up to you and insists on a vampire title, I still think \\"Bunnicula\\" is the way to go.  But if they've already read through all the vampire bunny tales in the world, kindly switch their attention to Elizabeth Levy's Sam and Robert Bamford series.  It has the added benefit of (if they live in New York and like their home town) a whole heaping helpful of pro-NYC information.  A fun title.  Not deep.

Through the years it's co-opted, retold, and twisted a whole range of interesting children's books and stories out there.  No one denies this.  However, Disney sometimes (without realizing it itself) does the world a boon.  Take, for example, the case of \\"The Rescuers\\".  Best known today as a cartoon movie in which Eva Gabor and Bob Newhart lend their voices to two adorable mouse rescuers of a little girl, few remember that the film originally began as a book series.  Fewer still have read that series today.  Yet for all its faults, Disney's movie still leads children to read Margery Sharp's impeccable little treasure.  It is debatable whether or not people would still remember the book were it not for the film.  What is not debatable is the fact that the book, for all its dated concepts and affectations, remains a wonderful classic.<br /><br />The Prisoners' Aid Society is a noble institution.  Run entirely by mice, the society strives to help cheer and aid a variety of prisoners held around the world.  This they do for the good of the world around them, and their selflessness is to be commended.  When it comes to the attention of the society that a Norwegian poet has been wrongly imprisoned in the legendary (and much feared) Black Castle, the mice waste no time in formulating a plan for the man's release.  The first thing to do, however, is to locate a brave Norwegian mouse to speak to the prisoner.  This would normally be a long and tedious process, but luck is with the society.  Bernard, a solid sturdy brown mouse, is dispatched to enlist the aid of Miss Bianca.  Miss Bianca is the white pet mouse of the ambassador's son and she has always lived in the lap of luxury.  Soon the ambassador and his son will be leaving for Norway and if Bernard can convince Miss Bianca to locate a brave Norwegian rodent for their cause, the prisoner may stand a chance.  Being a bit of a spoiled pet, Miss Bianca initially shies away from Bernard's pleas, but his good heart and her better nature prevail and soon she's involved in a world of intrigue and heroic mouse rescues.<br /><br />It's a funny book to read today for a number of reasons.  Because it was originally written in 1959, Miss Bianca is often spoken of as a lady.  She's spoiled so she doesn't understand how act in the real world.  So there is some interesting language regarding her complete confusion over things that \\"every\\" woman should know (like where a house's pantry is).  I was personally surprised to find that for all her charms, Miss Bianca begins the novel as an ignorant little thing prone to fainting fits and ends the book a little wiser if still slightly affected.  Bernard, for his part, immediately wins the hearts and minds of every person that meets him.  You completely understand his selfless devotion to Miss Bianca.  More shockingly to me, Miss Bianca seemingly returns Bernard's affections, even if she does place him second in her heart to the boy that is her master.  Sharp's language is especially effective.  Though I don't have clear memories of reading this tale as a child, the moment I came to the passage in which the evil jailer's room was covered in the bodies of beautiful impaled butterflies, suddenly everything came flooding back to me.  Finally, Garth Williams the Great has lent his illustrative hand to the project.  His pictures are fabulous.  No author has ever quite mastered the combination of cutesy (as in the case of the mice) and downright horrific (the cat in this book will, with any luck, give every reader that sees it nightmares).  Even if the text were not good, the pictures would be worth the price of purchase alone.<br /><br />Books in which mice speak and interact with one another on an almost human level abound in the children's literary world.  You have your \\"Poppy\\" by Avi and your \\"Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh\\" by Robert O'Brien.  You have \\"Time Stops For No Mouse\\" by Michael Hoeye and \\"Basil of Baker Street\\"by Eve Titus.  Add to the list, \\"The Rescuers\\", and you've a perfect platter of fabulous kiddie lit.

There are a variety of different cute-tiny-pet books out there.  \\"The Mouse and the Motorcycle\\" is, of course, one of the first that come to mind.  But the \\"Freddy\\" books are an entirely different breed of tale altogether.  Freddy, the golden hamster with the amazing ability of knowing how to read and write, is not your typical three-inch-tall hero.  He has a sardonic sarcastic voice and a sort of self-congratulatory style that makes him an easy target for the two wise-cracking guinea pigs with whom he lives.  If you couldn't get enough of Freddy's antics in, \\"I, Freddy\\", prepare to see a couple more in this particular sequel.<br /><br />Freddy brings the reader up to speed immediately, right from the start.  Writing, \\"I WAS IN MORTAL DANGER\\" so as to get your attention, the world's most famous golden hamster proceeds to tell the tale of how he was pursued by the relentless Dr. Fleischkopf.  Freddy had been living a pretty nice life for a while.  He interacted with the housecat Sir William for conversation and once in a while deigned to speak to Enrico and Caruso, the ham-actor guinea pigs in the next room.  But Freddy let his pride get to him.  In a moment of weakness, Freddy posts his life story on his owner's (Mr. John) webpage for all the world to see.  Mr. John quickly deletes the post, but not before the insidious golden hamster scientist Dr. Fleischkopf decides to catch and dissect Freddy's brain for his own research.  What follows is a fast moving tale in which Freddy and his pals attempt to escape the doctor's clutches with the aid of some rats, an uncivilized pussycat, and an animal rights reporter.<br /><br />As sequels go, \\"Freddy In Peril\\" wasn't as strong as I could've hoped.  It's infinitely readable, of course.  And I seriously doubt that any child that enjoyed the first book is going to find too many flaws in the second.  But there's something about this tale that feels a bit phoned in.  Unlike in \\"I, Freddy\\", where our hamster hero had to figure out how to escape from his own cage and communicate with his owner, in this book the protagonist is completely passive.  If anything happens for the good its because other people have gone out of their way to save Freddy.  He never gets to use his brains in a truly constructive way.  Also, there's a large sequence where a tribe of rats pledge to help Freddy escape Dr. Fleischkopf before they inexplicably disappear from the book entirely.  So our hero never thinks up his own escapes and plot points are dropped without explanation.  It makes for a faintly unsatisfying read.<br /><br />What I liked about the book was that there's a bit of the old unreliable narrator in Freddy.  For example, he'd rather die than admit that Enrico and Caruso were integral in saving his golden little hide.  And I love the illustrations (all thanks to pen and ink master Joe Cepeda) as ever.  You're not going to read this book and feel betrayed by the author.  But compared to its predecessor, \\"Freddy In Peril\\" lacks a certain sense of continuity.  Fortunately, I can assure you that by the third Freddy book (\\"Freddy to the Rescue\\") author Dietlof Reiche reasserts himself as the world's premiere golden hamster master.

Here's a fine example.  I grew up in strictly one cat household.  We did not own mice, or rats, or ferrets, or gerbils, or guinea pigs.  And if you had been so good as to hold up, before me, a guinea pig and a hamster, I doubt very much that I would've been able to tell the difference.  I probably would've continued in this state of blissful ignorance had not a fine little publication by the name of, \\"I, Freddy\\", come to my attention.  For you see, the hero of this little book is not only a hamster, but a golden hamster.  And so, through this delightful tale of a particularly gifted young rodent, I have learned a shocking amount of new facts about these tiny pets and their world.  It's just a nice added plus that the book's as amusing, well-written, and funny as it is.<br /><br />Freddy Auratus grew up in a pet shop different from his brethren.  Like all golden hamsters, he had to scrounge for food and maintain his own tiny territory.  However, Freddy had something his siblings didn't: an active interest in the world around him and a desperate desire to leave the pet shop world and find the fabled land of Assyria (original home of all golden hamsters).  To do this, he concocts a clever scheme to promote his own adorable qualities.  The scheme works beautifully and Freddy finds himself the property of a little girl named Sophie (a child he repeatedly states is, \\"A GIRL IN A MILLION!\\").  Unfortunately Sophie's mother is not as taken with the little guy as Sophie is.  And when Freddy's brains take him places he should not go, he finds himself in a new home with new neighbors.  Neighbors that include a very large black cat.  Will Freddy survive his new home?  Will he be able to establish contact with the intelligent adult world around him?  It's a mystery that only reading, \\"I, Freddy\\", will resolve.<br /><br />\\"I, Freddy\\", the book, originally hails from Germany (check out the interesting German covers on www.amazon.de for fun).  And unlike other children's titles from foreign countries, the translator's name appears right on the spine along with the author.  This got me to wondering how much of this book could be attributed to author Dietlof Reiche and how much to \\"Das Boot\\" translator John Brownjohn (which is, I might add, a fabulous name in and of itself).  But whether Brownjohn can take full, partial, or hardly any credit at all for the story, I don't care.  What matters is that, \\"I, Freddy\\", is delightful.  Freddy's take on life is a joy.  For example, when discussing golden hamster politics, Freddy mentions that when it comes to the tread-wheel, \\"the tread-wheel freaks were always lining up in front of it\\".  Even more delightful are Joe Cepeda's illustrations.  When first looking at the various \\"Golden Hamster Saga\\" covers (of which this book is only the first), I was not initially impressed with Mr. Cepeda's style.  That opinion reversed immediately, however, when I saw how brilliantly he incorporated his spiky pen and ink touches to the book itself.  There's a single picture of Freddy with his cheeks huge and full of food walking away with a furious expression on his face that reduced me to helpless giggles.

So I don't feel like I'm making a particularly good point when I say that this is the best out there today.

David Wiesner is best described as a light-hearted Chris Van Allsburg.  In his books there tends to be a very real and deep fascination with both the sky and breaking away from convention.  For example, his book \\"Tuesday\\" examines the repercussions of frogs flying at night.  \\"The Three Pigs\\", by contrast, takes a familiar story and loosens it up considerably.  With \\"Sector 7\\", a wordless tale of a boy and his cloud, Wiesner tells a tale of changing the status quo.  It's sometimes very difficult to find noteworthy wordless picture books out there but Wiesner appears to have an excellent grasp on this rarely appreciated genre.<br /><br />When a boy goes on a school field trip to the Empire State Building, he little suspects what a thrilling adventure he's about to have.  Initially, he's disappointed.  At the top of the tower the world is engulfed in a thick fog.  Yet out of this fog, an unlikely friend appears.  A little cloud, nicking the boy's hat and scarf for fun, quickly befriends the awed child and invites him up up up into the sky.  Riding on the cloud's back, the boy nears the processing station for Sector 7 (a sector that covers the general New York area with some space given to the Atlantic Ocean as well).  Boy and cloud pass through Receiving and enter the Assignment Station.  While there, they hear the complaints of other clouds.  The assignments are fine, but they're so dull.  Just the usual puffy fluffiness we see all the time in the sky.  With a little imagination, the boy convinces the clouds to try out new forms.  It seems they're particularly adept at the shapes of tropical fish.  Of course, the people in charge of the Sector 7 plant aren't pleased with the clouds' new shapes.  Yet after the boy has gone home, it's clear that his influence is being carried on by people who like the idea of doing things a little differently.<br /><br />Mr. Wiesner's the master of the clever little detail.  As parents and children go through this book (its wordless quality makes it an ideal gift for anyone, regardless of age or nationality) they find themselves discovering new little details with every read.  Did you catch the reason why the boy draws fish from the last shot in the book?  How about the ways in which the clouds wordlessly describe their boredom with previous assignments?  When I think of watercolors, I don't tend to think of highly accentuated details.  Just the same, Wiesner has tamed this highly adaptable medium to his own particular wants and needs.  He cleverly lets the boy's personal cloud continue to wear the kid's bright red cap throughout the book so that the reader can tell it apart from other cloudlings.  And there is no doubt left in the reader's mind that the Sector 7 processing plant is truly New Yorkian.  Resembling a kind of cross between a train station and an immaculate subway stop, this is a cosmopolitan factory if ever there was one.<br /><br />If you've never read a Wiesner to your child and aren't entirely certain where to start, it's hard to go wrong with \\"Sector 7\\".  Understandably, many see this as their favorite Wiesner book.  And while on paper I state that \\"The Three Pigs\\" is his magnum opus, I confess that \\"Sector 7\\" may be the one I love the most.

When I haven't perused a Fleming creation in a while, I have a nasty tendency to lump her in with fellow author/illustrators Lois Ehlert or Eric Carle.  But Fleming has something those two will never have.  A keen sense of what makes a colored cotton pulp illustration funny.  Ever since I first laid eyes on her clever \\"Lunch\\" (a title I highly recommend) I became a real fan.  And with \\"Barnyard Banter\\", I can clearly state that this is a children's picture book writer with a highly entertaining gaggle of tricks up her sleeve.<br /><br />This is a book that initially seems to be best categorized as one of those baryard sound titles.  The first two-page spread shows a three cow herd of red-eyed (some might say demonic) heifers accompanied by the words, \\"Cows in the pasture, moo, moo, moo\\".  On the next page are two strutting birds with a, \\"Roosters in the barnyard, cocka-doodle-doo\\".  You get the idea.  Each two-page spread rhymes with the next, which makes for some creative stretches on the part of the author (apparently frogs say \\"burp burp burp\\").  As this jouncy book continues, once in a while the words, \\"But where's Goose?\\" appear in a corner.  The goose, for its part, actually appears in every single animal's spotlight in some way.  When we're viewing pigeons in the rafters, goose is far below perpetually chasing an elusive butterfly.  When we're amidst the crows of the cornfield, the goose's beak peeks out from the lower right-hand side, stretching towards the flutterby above.  This means that kids can have a lot of fun going through the book and finding that semi-obsessive goosey.<br /><br />The words of the book are catchy, especially in a section that is simply every three-letter animal cry we've read combined into a bouncy rhythmic poem.  So points should be given for the kind of text that gets little pre-schoolers involved (any book you can sing to usually falls into that category).  But many a slap-happy sing-n-dance text has been brought low by dull colorless or otherwise blah illustrations.  Not so here.  Using her customary technique of (and I'm quoting the book jacket here), \\"pouring colored cotton pulp through hand-cut stencils\\" in a method described as \\"pulp painting\\", this book's a ribald explosion of color and form.  Though you'd swear, just glancing at it, that this was yet another cut paper picture book, closer inspection reveals the complicated process that \\"Barnyard Banter\\" required.  You've got coffee grounds for soil!  You've got kernels of oats for grain bins!  You've even got portions of burlap sacks disguised as chicken-wire fences.  And the colors... oh the colors.  Part of my love for Fleming's other book, \\"Lunch\\" was due to her firm grasp of the primaries.  That love can now be transferred to this book as well.  The whole tale's awash in bright clear-cut images that could easily leave you blinking your eyes from sunspots.<br /><br />Whether you're searching for a book that follows the whole \\"the &lt;enter obligatory farm animal here> says\\" genre, or you want a book that uses rhythm in a novel way, or even if you just want a story where kids can locate an elusive naughty animal, \\"Barnyard Banter\\" fulfills all these needs and more.  I tip my hat to Denise Fleming and promise her that I will never ever ever confuse her again with Lois Ehlert.  Ever.  In fact I'll do more than that.  I'll remember how much I like Fleming's books and recommend them to all I see.  That, I feel, is a perfectly appropriate penance.

Some picture books are written to deliver a certain sense of comfort to their preschool readerdom.  They might reassure children that no monsters lurk in dark shadows beneath their bed, or that going to school for the first time can be scary but fun.  But there's a really basic worry that children feel even if they may not always be able to vocalize it.  It's the worry that one's parents no longer love them because they've been naughty or bad in some way.  And if yesterday you had stopped me on the street, point blank, to ask me to name a picture book, just off the top of my head, that confronted this fear, I would've been up a tree.  Maybe I would've babbled something about the end of \\"No, David\\" by David Shannon.  No longer.  Now when someone asks me to name such a book, I have \\"Don't Forget I Love You\\" to back me up.  A sweet tale of a mother-son relationship that is ever-so briefly tested and survives intact.<br /><br />From the moment Billy wakes up in the morning the day gets off to a slow start.  In Billy's own words, \\"Rabbit's being naughty\\".  Billy's stuffed rabbit is the cause of a lot of delay as both boy and mother get ready for the day.  When Billy's supposed to wash his hands, Rabbit won't \\"eat\\" his egg.  When Billy's supposed to get dressed for the day, Rabbit has a stomach ache (according to Billy).  And when Billy's supposed to brush his teeth, Rabbit's buttons are all askew.  By the time Billy drops both Rabbit and his lunchbox in the mud on the way to school (in the midst of blustery rainy weather), Mama's had enough.  So Billy gets dropped off to school, late, without Rabbit (forgotten in Mama's bag) and without Mama remembering to say she loves him.  This is nearly enough to set Billy off into a truly miserable tantrum.  Fortunately, all is resolved in the end when Mama returns apologetic and gives Billy both his beloved stuffed toy and his much needed, \\"I love you\\"<br /><br />There's not much of a plot to this remarkably simple story.  And the book could've stood a little more clarification when it comes to whether or not this is actually a book about childhood fears of not being loved.  Still, it's awfully sweet.  Author Miriam Moss has a whole heaping helpful of books of this nature already under her belt as it is.  Fortunately, she's been paired here with illustrator Anna Currey.  And while the pictures aren't exactly going to blow you away, they fit the text nicely.  Parents looking for books that support single mother homes might also appreciate Mama's position in this tale.  Not only must she get her kid out the door and herself off to work but she must battle raging winds, an unruly stuffed pet, and a laconic tot to boot.<br /><br />This is not the first, second, or even third title that I'd recommend if someone were to ask for a good picture book.  But when it comes to the specific fears it confronts, should someone want a book of this nature, \\"Don't Forget I Love You\\" would be a first choice.

Why the year 2004 alone was privy to such fabulous tomes as, \\"The Cats of Krasinski Square\\", by Karen Hesse and \\"The Greatest Skating Race\\", by Louise Borden.  Usually such picture books are examinations of the Holocaust and/or Jewish oppression.  Borden's book, however, takes an entirely different route.  Concentrating on the German occupation in the Netherlands, the book shows how resistance and bravery can flower in children when the need is great enough.  Though this book is far too lengthy and involved to seriously interest any child under the age of eight, I'd still recommend it to those tykes that can maintain their interest through a riveting race against time.<br /><br />Piet (pronounced \\"pete\\") has a single burning obsession that has yet to be thoroughly quenched.  He loves to skate.  This is not particularly peculiar in the Netherlands, of course.  After all, he comes from a long line of skate artisans and often he traverses the many canals that run through his town.  But Piet's real hope is to someday compete in the difficult Elfstedentocht race held in Friesland when the winters are cold enough.  Piet's hero, Pim Mulier, once completed the 200 kilometer (roughly 125 mile) course in just 12 hours and 55 minutes and Piet's raring to do the same.  But it's the second winter into WWII and the Netherlands are under German occupation.  What's worse, a father of two kids in Piet's school was recently arrested by the Germans for passing on information to the British.  This places the man's children in dire peril and their only hope is to somehow escape over the border to Belgium and then into the town of Brugge to safety.  But how could two such children be able to find their way?  That's where Piet comes in.  With his trusty red notebook in hand, Piet and the kids must escape and elude the Germans and make it to their safehouse in the course of a single day over 12 kilometers.  If they're strong enough.<br /><br />Though looking like a picture book, this is an in-depth read more appropriate for kids reading early chapter titles.  In the course of the narrative, author Louise Borden spots the text with factual information in the form of maps, pronunciation guides (very useful when you have words like, \\"Elfstedentocht\\" to contend with), and info on the great Friesland race as well as a history of skating itself.  It's enough to make your head spin.  And then, to top it all off, there's the story.  Borden cleverly sucks you into the action.  It did strike me as a little odd that in this book the adults would place Piet in such danger when a grown-up probably could've have helped the two children instead.

If they're strong enough. <br />  <br />Though looking like a picture book, this is an in-depth read more appropriate for kids reading early chapter titles.  In the course of the narrative, author Louise Borden spots the text with factual information in the form of maps, pronunciation guides (very useful when you have words like, \\"Elfstedentocht\\" to contend with), and info on the great Friesland race as well as a history of skating itself.  It's enough to make your head spin.  And then, to top it all off, there's the story.  Borden cleverly sucks you into the action.  It did strike me as a little odd that in this book the adults would place Piet in such danger when a grown-up probably could've have helped the two children instead.

Had author Dare Wright been told by her psychiatrist (an entity that, to the best of my knowledge, she never had any much needed contact with) that it might do her some good to explicitly put her daddy/abandonment issues into a work of childhood fiction, she could not have come up with a better product than the one here before us.  Children have been unwittingly exposed to this historical moment of insanity for years and years now.  And what with a new burgeoning (some might say macabre) interest in Dare Wright as a person, \\"The Lonely Doll\\" has been foisted back onto the printing presses of the Houghton Mifflin Company for everyone to read once more.  And what a read it is.  Spanking.  Petticoats.  Oddly staged photographs.  The whole kerschmozzle feels remarkably out-of-date but still weird enough that you can't look away.  It's like watching a train wreak.  A beautifully staged, hideously entrancing train wreak.<br /><br />Bear with me while I give you a summary of the plot. Wright's strengths may have lay in many areas but dialogue, narration, and storytelling were not the first ones that come to mind.  There once was an exceptionally pretty little doll named Edith.  Edith apparently had a fine little life, except that she lived all by her lonesome.  One day, two traveling stuffed bears came to stay with her and be her friends.  And at first all was well.  Mr. Bear (the patriarch of the proceedings) would teach the little bear and Edith lessons and they got to play all the time.  Oh sure, there was the occasional scolding but nothing too severe.  That is, until the day Mr. Bear went out for a rainy walk leaving the two alone in the house.  Before you knew it they dressed up in some of the old clothes, put on make-up, and wrote the oh-so-shocking words, \\"Mr. Bear is just a silly old thing\\" in the mirror.  And for this unspeakable act of vice the returning Mr. Bear gave a thorough spanking to the two for their crimes.  Now up until now, the book's been a little weird but not particularly crazy.  But it is at this point that the physical punishment (Edith overturned on Mr. Bear's knee with frilly petticoats ah-showing) for these relatively minor crimes is trumped by Edith's reaction.  Is she mad or upset at the spanking?  Not in the least!  She's miserable because she thinks this means Mr. Bear's going to take off with the little bear and leave the lonely doll of the title all by herself again.  So with much bowing and scraping and oh-please-don't-leave-me's, Mr. Bear agrees to stay and all is happy and joyful once more.<br /><br />The plot, as I've written it, is not the kind you'd see put on the market for the first time today.  Not through any reputable publisher anywho.  The spankage is a far cry from the standard Kevin-Henkes-time-out punishments doled out in contemporary picture books.  But just concentrating on that aspect of the book isn't an accurate way of explaining the doggone weirdness of the whole \\"Lonely Doll\\" enterprise.  A lot of this is in the photographs themselves.  Books of this nature, where characters are just toys that are set up and photographed so as to act out a story, are rare.  Black and white photos at that.  Black and white photos about an uncommonly pretty doll.  Edith (whom some have pointed out bears a striking resemblance to her own creator) is remarkable partly because her face has been perfectly constructed.  She can express any emotion depending on how one shoots her and what the situation is that she's in.  While her hands and feet are lumpy and unformed, her face and air are always at their best.  And say what you will about the book, Wright had a way with a camera.  These are splendidly rendered photos that work precisely because of the time and effort put into them.  So well done there.<br /><br />Really, it's Edith's neediness that remains the single unchallenged and most distressing point of this book.  As many biographers of Wright's life will tell you, the author was abandoned by her father and brother at a young age.  And here, in her new and improved doll form, they come back in a sense and... um... spank her.  Hm.  And when the father bear does so Edith begs him never to leave.  She just can't stand the thought of ever being alone.  I'm not one to tell parents what books are or aren't good for children.  But I get the distinct impression here that no matter what kind of kid you have, they'll probably be as confused about Edith's wimpy neediness as you are after reading this book.<br /><br />Still, people who read this as kids swear by it.  And they probably haven't ended up as passive doll-like schlubs.  Nevertheless, I can think of far better books with similar themes.  Like pretty female doll picture books?  Try \\"Dahlia\\" by Barbara McClintok.  Or how about a doll book that breaks through stereotypes and will expand your child's mind?  Go for \\"William's Doll\\" by Charlotte Zolotow.  Like stories where a lonely person finds friends through trial and error?  Try, \\"Pig and Crow\\" by Kay Chorao.  Or books that contain lots of fun photographs?  Spend your time poring over Walter Wicks' stuff.  But if you're like me and you want to see what all the fuss is about, definitely read \\"The Lonely Doll\\" for yourself.  I can say with absolute certainty that while it's not going to win any parenting or literary awards, it takes first prize in the I'm-going-to-live-out-my-personal-issues-through-this-here-doll category any day.

Author (Awards))	Books	4	2	2	N	N	The real "world's oldest profession"	When I first heard of the concept of this book I was skeptical.  Another children's book about midwifery?  Goodness me, didn't we already have \\"The Midwife's Apprentice\\" to fill that particular gap?  Why on earth would the world need more than one book on the painful process of birthing babies?  But after a moment of such ludicrous thoughts, I came to my senses.  After all, we're talking about one of the most difficult and underappreciated professions in the world.  The kind of job that's never received the respect of the medical community (in spite of having preceded it) or even the general modern populace.  And this is the kind of job that's universal.  Wherever there are humans, there are midwives.  Heck, thinking in such terms as that, it's amazing that there aren't MORE children's books about it.  Where's the Chinese midwife tale?  The Roman?  The Pict?  Till such stories come, we must be content with what we have.  And what we have is a lovely little number called, \\"Miss Violet and Me\\".  A slim 100 page novella, the book had its flaws and fumbles, but altogether it's a good egg.  A nice little tale.<br /><br />Viney hasn't a clue where babies come from.  All she knows from experience is that once in a while her mama gets fat and then the amazing Missy Violet comes in the house and leaves them with a beautiful new baby.  Unfortunately, Missy doesn't work for free and Viney's father owes her a child or two.  The fairest method of payment turns out to be Viney herself.  Turned into Missy Violet's own personal helper, Viney has the joyful task of going out and helping her idol \\"catch a baby\\" or two.  In the process, she learns the truth of birth, how to cope in difficult situations, and eventually how to save the day.  Set in the rural South around the 1930s, the book tells short enjoyable tales about the rarely recorded lives of African-American midwives.<br /><br />I commend the book fully for its subject matter.  First time author Barbara Hathaway based the tales on the stories told by her mother about a relative who'd served as a southern midwife in the 30s.  Through the book we get a peek into the inner workings of those professionals that relied on useful herbs and home remedies to produce healthy babies and mothers.  Unfortunately, the book is only 100 pages.  Just as you begin to learn a little more about Missy Violet and Viney, the book stops with a screech.  I couldn't help but feel that there was so much more to say in this story.  So much more to tell.  Also, I got the really clear sense that white people get off pretty darn easily.  Every white person in this book seems to be exceptionally broadminded towards their African-American neighbors.  There's hardly a whiff of prejudice, let alone Jim Crow.  And though I probably wouldn't have wanted the book to indulge in lengthy speeches against the evils of the world, a little realistic glimpse into just how HARD it was to be black in the South in the 30s wouldn't have been out of place.<br /><br />So credit towards a great story and interesting characters.  Points off for an overabundance of nice whites and zippo recognition of the reality of the setting.  As a first book, \\"Missy Violet and Me\\" has lovely potential.  Author Hathaway is certain to produce more fine books in the future.

I propose that we invent an entirely new category of children's literature.  In my life I've had the pleasure of discovering, usually through complete accident, fabulous picture books that use poetry to convey seasons.  Tasha Tudor's, \\"A Time To Keep\\" was the first of these and remains a favorite (if only because it is intricately tied into my own childhood).  The second such book was Charlotte Zolotow's breathtaking, \\"Seasons: A Book of Poems\\".  Words cannot convey how much I enjoyed that book.  And now, lo and behold, I've found a third leg to this unlikely triumvirate.  And who could have dreamed it would have sprung from the pen of writer extraordinaire John Updike?  In \\"A Child's Calendar\\", Updike's 1965 poems have been given a lively update, all thanks to illustrator Trina Schart Hyman.  The result is a book that truly embraces diversity, change, and how kids react to the natural ebb and flow of the seasons.  It is one of the loveliest books for children I've ever had the pleasure to page through.<br /><br />The book begins in January, and we meet a family of four.  An interracial couple and their two sons live in the country, and sometimes the neighbor kids come by.  The cold winter months freeze the earth so that, \\"The river is/ A frozen place/ Held still beneath/ The trees' black lace\\".  With the arrival of spring, the family is out in the yard (with the toddler sometimes \\"helping\\" by plucking daffodils from the earth, bulbs and all) and \\"We still wear mittens/ Which we lose\\".  Summer shows us various idyllic childhood scenes involving ponds to explore, roads to bike down, fireworks, and beachside adventures.  Though, as Updike is quick to point out in August, \\"The trees are bored/With being green/ Some people leave/ The local scene\\".  So autumn comes and school begins.  There are costumes and changing leaves as, \\"Blue ghosts of smoke/ Float through the town\\".  And then winter again and Christmas and a feeling of having gotten through quite an interesting year.<br /><br />It is difficult not to admire the pictures in this book.  Hyman has done an exquisite job.  I've adored her work over the years (check out \\"The Fortune Tellers\\" by Lloyd Alexander, if you can) and this book is a great example of what she's capable of.  Her watercolors capture the spirit of the outdoors as well as the comfort and coziness of staying within.  I loved the pictures that accompanied January's poem.  Outside the kids stare, with sleds in hand, at the small town and the momentous grey/pink sky above (as seen on the book's cover).  The other picture is from inside the home.  You can see where the boots, removed after stomping about outside, lay with semi-melted snow still scattered on the rug.  Hyman especially gives a great deal of attention to her lighting.  That way, a spring morning looks nothing like a summer evening or the winter holiday season at night.  The book makes you want to pack up your things, buy a house in the middle of nowhere (possibly in Michigan), and live with your nearest and dearest with all the beauties of nature about you.  It's a book that makes you yearn for a time and place you've never known.<br /><br />And the poems.  Ah, the poems.  I don't think Mr. Updike needs me to compliment him any.  He's already acquired his fair share of praise.  So all I will say is that for those that love him, this book will not disappoint.  For those who do not know him (or do not know him well), I'll just quote some lines of his describing November: \\"The stripped and shapely/ Maple grieves/ The loss of her/ Departed leaves. The ground is hard/ As hard as stone/ The year is old/ The birds are flown. And yet the world/ Nevertheless/ Displays a certain/ Loveliness - The beauty of/ The bone. Tall God/ Must see our souls/ This way, and nod\\".<br /><br />So there we have it.  One of the nicest additions to the world of seasonal poetry books (accompanied by watercolors) for children.  Children will find themselves oddly soothed by the poems and pictures.  Grown-ups will be mildly surprised to find themselves feeling the same way.d by the poems and pictures.

256638:US	49148452	R2PITZPH0LYHLU	0688135455	938923523	Five Children and It (Books of Wonder)	Books	5	45	48	N	N	If wishes were horses, poor men would ride	With the surging popularity of Lemony Snicket's, \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\", the time has never been better to gently urge children towards those literary classics that sound so mightily similar to their beloved Baudelaire sagas.  And of the great children's authors that employed direct narration, few are so wonderful yet rarely remembered as the fantastic Edith Nesbit.  The woman who single-handedly redefined the whole kid-fantasy genre.  As the Books of Wonder edition of \\"Five Children and It\\" is quick to point out, until Nesbit happened along, children's fantasy novels either took place in some \\"far-off fantasy-land (Alice to Wonderland; Dorothy to Oz)\\" or simply began and ended in their own magical world (The Princess and the Goblin, for example).  No one had really explored normal every day children stumbling across magic.  And that, of course, brings us to the fabulous, \\"Five Children and It\\".  Written in Nesbit's trademark snarky Edwardian style, the tale remains as amusing to children today as it did back in the early 20th century.  I remember it fondly from my own tender youth, and since I'm only 27 that should certainly say something.<br /><br />Now there were once five city children.  The eldest was Cyril and the youngest was simply referred to as \\"the Lamb\\", since it was only a baby and was dearly adored and spoiled by its family.  One summer the children have the delightful opportunity to be left in a seaside house with only their servants to care for them.  While exploring the grounds of their new home, the kids come across a strange furry creature in their local gravel pit.  It has extended eyes like a snail, the ears of a bat, monkey hands and feet, and a big furry spiderish body.  It is, of course, a Psammead (or Sand-fairy) and the kids have a chance to make one wish a day.  In your normal Edwardian novel, this might be a good thing and the kids might have delightfully boring adventures for the rest of the book.  Not here.  The Psammead, you see, is a bit of a jerk.  A self-satisfied eternally complaining jerk.  And whatsoever the children wish for, be it wings or money, somehow their wishes have a tendency to go awry.  Still, when you've a whole summer before you and a pile of wishes waiting to be made, life can get very interesting indeed.<br /><br />To my mind, Nesbit's best book is without question, \\"The Phoenix and the Carpet\\".  That said, this is an excellent companion to it.  Now I had the pleasure of reading an edition with the original Millar illustrations when I was young.  And if you're a fan of pen and ink, that could certainly be a nice choice.  But if you want an edition that's really going to get your children's attention, try the Books of Wonder publication with illustrations by Paul O. Zelinsky.  Zelinsky, as it notes in the back of the book, had a great deal of difficulty drawing the Psammead since Millar's own version was uncommonly faithful to Nesbit's description.  Nonetheless, Zelinsky has the advantage of color and full page spreads.  So when the children acquire beautiful rainbow colored wings, you see them here in all their showy glory.  Better still are the tiny black and white illustrations on the book's inside covers that show multiple amusing scenes from the book.<br /><br />And as for Nesbit herself, none can compare.  She employs the tone of a conspirator towards her child readers.  Often adults are ridiculed for being too blunt and unimaginative to understand what's being said here.  The book teems with plots that would be later employed and stolen by such future authors as C.S. Lewis and (more obviously) Edward Eager.  In fact, as a kid I often got Eager and Nesbit mixed up in my head.  Some critics of this tale sigh with great moans that the kids here don't talk like kids today.  Well lah-de-dah.  The children in the \\"Peanuts\\" comic strip don't talk like kids today either.  Shall we just go chuck all of Charles Schultz's work into the Boston Harbor and forget he ever existed?  Ladies and gentlemen, we simply cannot go about condemning classic children's books because our slang has changed.  Kids today will still love \\"Five Children and It\\" and they'll adore its ridiculous plotting.  If anything is dated about this book it's the truly odd moments of racism in it.  Though Nesbit is to be applauded for giving gypsies a fair shake, the same cannot be said for American Indians.  The British obsession with Native Americans is as puzzling now as it was then.  So you should at least know that there's one chapter in this book that, if you don't particularly care for Edwardian stereotypes, can be easily skipped past if you so choose.  Or not.  It's entirely up to you.<br /><br />In any case, this is a fine fine tale.  They don't hardly make `em like this no more (though they certainly try to).  A tip of the hat to Ms. Nesbit for all that she has done for children's literature.  And a tip of the hat to every kid today that picks the book up for a lark.  A memorable tale.he ever existed?

You gasped as you read, \\"Henry Builds a Cabin\\".  And now comes the boldest addition to the Henry series yet.  In true Thoreauian fashion (life's too short not to write the word, \\"Thoreauian\\" once in a while) Henry's back and he's mad.  Mad at the state for legalizing slavery, that is.  Adding yet another title to his Henry-David-Thoreau-as-portrayed-by-bear series, author D.B. Johnson serves up his tightest Henry tale to date.  The book is a gutsy (and, some might say, timely) tale of disrespecting an immoral authority.<br /><br />One day, Henry the bear decides to go mountain climbing.  Trouble is, he seems to have only one shoe (the other being fixed at the local shoemaker's).  So, one-footed Henry decides to visit the shoemaker and get his article of clothing back.  While in town, he meets up with Sam the tax collector.  Sam asks Henry why he hasn't paid his taxes.  \\"Pay a state that lets farmers own slaves?  Never!\\".  So it's off to the clinker for Henry.  While there, he removes some crayons from his pocket and begins to draw on the wall.  First he draws a second shoe.  Then flowers.  Then a path, and a river, and finally the mountain Henry wanted to climb in the first place.  Reaching the top (for he has now created his own reality) he meets a traveler escaping North.  Suffice to say, by the end of the story Henry has given away his shoes and, since someone else has paid his taxes, he bids adieu to the city jail.  When asked how it feels to be free he responds, \\"It feels like being on top of a very tall mountain\\".  And off he goes.<br /><br />The book draws on a passage of Thoreau's, detailing a similar incident from his life.  Some may contest whether Thoreau was jailed for not paying taxes because he objected to slavery or because he objected to supporting the Mexican War.  The passage quoted in the book says, \\"...I was seized and put into jail, because I did not pay a tax to, or recognize the authority of, the state which buys and sells men, women, and children, like cattle at the door of its senate-house\\".  Seems pretty clear to me.  Johnson turns this simple story into a topsy-turvy through the looking glass kind of adventure.  What Henry draws becomes real, and it is this post-modern aspect of the tale that makes it just a hair better than most books that cover similar subjects (civil disobedience and the like).<br /><br />But as always, the real glory here goes to the illustrations.  And what illustrations these are.  As always, Johnson's style of choice is pseudo-cubism.  But it's the little details that I especially like.  The mouse that lives with Henry in the jail and that escapes with him at the end.  The ads for runaway slaves that pepper the walls of buildings.  And the woodland creatures are especially nice.  Everything from timid skunks to chubby chickadees.  You would have a hard time finding fault with such lovely lithesome pictures.<br /><br />To sum up: Good story.  Good writing.  Good illustrations.  Good book.  Of the Henry series (that I have read) this is my number one choice.  A fine bit of schooling in civil disobedience for preschool activists.

Her insightful knowledge of just what kinds of details kids find exciting or interesting as regards huge hairy spiders was right on the money.  The book was one of those tales that I find myself thrusting into the arms of already overburdened grade school teachers at the local library in which I work.  So when I discovered that she had written ANOTHER non-fiction children's text in 2004, I snapped it up right quick.  It looked great too.  A whole big beautiful book about the discovery of what the author initially believes to be a brand new species of bear.  What's not to like?  But as I read the tale, I became increasingly disappointed.  Montgomery is excellent at describing the different kinds of bears there are in the world and the techniques scientists use to identify new bears the world over.  I liked the photographs and the wonderful information about the animals of Cambodia.  But when it comes to some of the book's most basic details, Montgomery grows sloppy.  She confuses the reader with vague terms and doesn't clarify why some discoveries are important and some merely interesting.  I grew so confused while reading this book that I found myself wondering how the heck a kid was supposed to figure out whether the author was referring to one bear or another.  Even the photographs remain uncaptioned, or captioned only randomly.  Unlike her magnificent \\"Tarantula Scientist\\", this book is a mish-mash of poor editing.  One suspects she merely took the adult version of it (which came out in 2002 and sports the same name) and winnowed it down for kids without taking much time to iron out the problems.  The result is a book that could have been priceless and is, instead, merely okay.<br /><br />The premise is very exciting.  Sy Montgomery (who is such an essential player in this book that she never hesitates to place herself in the center of the action) was canoeing down the Amazon River with scientist Dr. Gary Galbreath when she first heard about the mythical golden moon bear he once saw.  It was more than fifteen years ago in the little town of Yunnan that he saw a bear unlike any other ever found before.  Though he was unable to find a match for it, and never returned to the region, he always dreamt of going back and finding the animal.  When Galbreath's sighting is echoed by Montgomery's friend Sun Hean, the three decide to take a special trip to find the bear and get it down in the history books.  You might expect the rest of the book to be an arduous retelling of how they finally found the elusive bear and plucked some hairs for reference, but actually they find one by page 29. Pages 30-77 are just follow-up as the crew finds more bears, plucks more hairs, and discovers some surprising facts about this little known animal.<br /><br />The problem I had with the book began on page 12.  It is here that Montgomery makes the very smart move of including a list of different bears around the world, along with photographs of each and every one.  These eight species of bear include pandas, grizzlies, and sloth bears, as well as both sun AND moon bears.  It was the moon bears that began my trouble.  They're mentioned right at the start.  Ursus thibetanus.  The moon bear, we learn, has a crescent-moon-shaped patch of white on its chest.  It lives in many parts of Asia and has been known to learn how to ride bikes and skates.  Fair enough.  The problem comes when Montgomery carries on with her story.  Now you'll remember that this entire book is called, \\"Search For the Golden Moon Bear\\".  Well, Montgomery becomes exceedingly sloppy after a while.  Instead of referring to the bear she seeks as a \\"golden moon bear\\" she sometimes shortens it to just \\"moon bear\\".  Of which, you'll recall, there is already a species.  In fact, the book ALSO looks at real moon bears, so that you can never tell whether or not the bears being addressed are just your average already discovered \\"moon bears\\" or \\"golden moon bears\\".  About pages 54-55 she so intertwines the two species that I couldn't for the life of me figure out what was going on.  If Montgomery had even included a picture of an average moon bear in the aforementioned \\"eight species of bear\\" section, it would've been fine.  But the moon bear is the only animal NOT included in that section (with the obvious exclusion of the golden moon bear as well).<br /><br />It makes for infuriating reading.  All the more so when you consider how interesting the book is in other portions.  I loved the section on large mammals recently discovered in Cambodia.  Montgomery does away with the myth that \\"everything has already been discovered\\".  She mentions the fanged deer recently found and the rabbits striped like zebras (not shown in a photograph, unfortunately).  She even talks about the Indochinese warty hog that was accidentally eaten by a team of scientists in 1995 and has yet to be photographed.  Even the sections of this book that talk about DNA are fascinating.  Sadly, whatever discoveries made are obscured by the lackadaisical names thrown hither and thither.  I couldn't figure out what was going on by the end, and I'm certain that a ten-year-old in my shoes, however intelligent they might be, would feel the same.<br /><br />The book is a perfect waste.  There's so much good in it.  So much worth reading up on.  I mean, the world needs more fascinating scientific non-fiction books for kids.  Especially ones that include so many female scientists.  But when the writing suffers, the book suffers.  So it is with a heavy heart that I tell you that this is not Montgomery's best.  I suggest you seek out her \\"Tarantula Scientist\\" and read that instead.  As for \\"Golden Moon Bear\\", my hope is that subsequent publications in the future will erase all the problems I've mentioned here and make the book the beautiful story it deserves to be.

I love knowing that when I walk down the street I could easily be walking past the greatest parachutist or professional kite flyer in the world, and I would never know.  The hobbies and talents of the people of this world takes my breath away.  Which makes reviewing a title like, \\"A Good Day's Fishing\\" an incredibly complex arrangement.  First of all, I have never fished.  Not a day of my life.  This isn't because I dislike fishing or find it disgusting in some way.  I've just never been a situation where someone handed me a pole and a tackle box and said, \\"Let's catch a few\\" (or words to that extent).  Like many people I've flipped past fishing shows on PBS on cloudy Sunday afternoons and idly wondered who watches that stuff.  But I have every respect for the people who enjoy the sport.  Author James Prosek enjoys the sport.  He enjoys it so much that he's written and illustrated multiple texts on trout, fly fishing, and other such topics.  He's sort of the author/illustrator prodigy of the fish world.  And now, at the grand old age of 29, he's switched his focus to children's books.  No matter how big an author, no matter what their specialty, sooner or later everyone tries to write a book for kids.  And that's where I come in.  Looking \\"A Good Day's Fishing\\" over, I was baffled.  As I've mentioned, I'm not exactly experienced in the hobby.  I mean, I really enjoyed the recent children's book by Cynthia DeFelice, \\"The Missing Manatee\\", that outlines fishing in great exciting detail.  But a picture book that simply catalogues the things you need to catch yourself a crappie or a pumpkinseed sunfish.... let's just say that there's a very specific type of child that's going to find this book enthralling.<br /><br />Now the book follows a kid as he goes through his tackle box and tells the reader that, \\"what I need for a good day's fishing is in here somewhere!\\".  We look at various lures and the fish each one is adept at catching.  There are spinners for yellow perch and bobbers and sinkers to catch carp.  We see extra line and a wide range of hooks (which, the hero notes, are cool) alongside forgotten maggoty sandwiches (my favorite part, actually) and a stray eel.  There are rods and plugs and flies and lures.  And finally, \\"my hat\\", which ends the text.  We are then treated to a large lure and fly glossary that tells you absolutely every last little thing you ever needed to know about the equipment listed in the book.<br /><br />This kind of book is so specialized that I cannot really recommend it to anyone who ISN'T downright fascinated by fishing.  But if your child leaps at the chance of standing alongside large bodies of water with their own little tacklebox, then I can think of no book better than this one.  Admittedly, I'm a little baffled as to why this book got on the New York Public Library's 2004 100 Books to Remember list.  It's too specific to please a great many people (and frankly, if you're not a fisherperson yourself, the glossary reads like stereo instructions).  But Prosek's put his heart into it, and it shows.  Wielding his watercolor brush with great panache he's as adept at drawing the tiniest little white maggot as he is a largemouth bass gunning for a plug.  This is a lovely book to look at.  And detailed out the wazoo.<br /><br />So if you like fishing and want your kids to like it (or they already do) then this is the perfect picture book for them.  If you've merely a mild interest in the sport, however, avoid this book at all costs.  For those that need it, nothing else will do.

I know I sure do.  If you met me at a fancy dinner party and asked me my opinion on early vs. late Dr. Seuss or the finer points of why \\"Rainbow Fish\\" is the worst title ever written, I'd happily treat you to an hours long speech on such topics.  But then I come across a fabulous, and not particularly recent, picture book and I have to admit that when it comes to the great children's books of this or any age, I'm still as ignorant as I ever was or ever will be.  \\"The Line Up Book\\", proved this fact to me yet again.  It's a fabulous title.  A fun, funny, frantic tale of how one boy with slight obsessive compulsive tendencies reaches his goal without compromising his beliefs.  And when was this lovely little work published, might you ask?  Why 1986, of course.  So the fact that more people don't know it is a serious matter indeed.<br /><br />The very second that Sam dumps his blocks on the floor, he hears his mother calling him down for lunch.  \\"Just a minute\\", he calls back.  But a minute may be a little less time than he needs.  Carefully, Sam lines up the blocks at strategic intervals, all the way to his bedroom door.  \\"I need something else\\", he muses.  Fortunately there are books nearby.  These he lines up all the way to the bathroom.  Next come bath toys.  Then boots.  Then cars and trucks.  But a short distance from the kitchen door (where his mother is growing increasingly irate at being ignored) Sam finds he's stuck.  There's nothing more to line up and he hasn't reached his goal.  Fortunately, when lying his full length and stretching, Sam juuuust reaches the door with his body.  And his mother, while requesting that in the future, \\"please come when I call you\\", is very proud of her well-organized son.<br /><br />There's a lot to like here.  If you've a preschooler who likes their drama on a small small scale, \\"The Line Up Book\\" is ideal.  The tension heightens as Sam's mother keeps yelling and threatening to count to three.  His search in desperation for something else to line up is real and intense.  Only with this nice ending (and understanding mama) does the book work as well as it does.  Sam and his mother are an amiable crew.  She sports a nice multi-patterned sweater, and he a lovely pair of violet overalls.  I also loved the last picture in the story.  There, at the table, Sam and mom smile at one another over their sandwiches and soup.  Nothing more really needs to be said, and that's a-okay.<br /><br />No, it's not going to earn itself any long thesis papers by kiddie lit scholars.  But \\"The Line Up Book\\" is on the New York Public Library's list of \\"100 Picture Books Everyone Should Know\\" for 2004/05, and I for one approve heartily of its inclusion.  It's a dear little book.  The kind that everyone can love and few will find a drop of fault with.  The very definition of sweet.on a small small scale, \\"The Line Up Book\\" is ideal.

If a children's picture book is filled with just too many injokes and gags for the parents to get (and not their kids) then that book is immediately given the back-handed compliment of \\"hip\\".  The \\"Olivia\\" books by Ian Falconer are \\"hip\\".  \\"Many Moons\\" by James Thurber is \\"hip\\".  Do you see the trend?  These books tend to be written or illustrated by New Yorker cartoonists/writers.  So it only makes sense that such uncalled for disparaging remarks should be attached to my beloved Harry Bliss.  In this delightful \\"Mrs. Watson Wants Your Teeth\\" (a delicious addition to his similar school-based story, \\"A Fine Fine School\\"), author Alison McGhee and illustrator Bliss tell a tale of realistic childhood fears and the surprising way that one little first grader overcomes them.<br /><br />\\"I have a secret\\", a small girl confides in us, right from the start.  \\"First grade begins today, and I'm in BIG trouble\\".  The trouble comes in the form of \\"advice\\" given by a malicious second grader who immediately pounces on our helpless heroine on the bus.  The second grader informs us that Mrs. Watson, the first grader's new teacher, is actually an alien from outer space.  And this particular alien's preferred meals?  Baby teeth.  First grader baby teeth at that.  According to the second grader, Mrs. Watson has a thick purple tongue and that we should look closely at her \\"pearl\\" necklace and earrings.  By the time our protagonist reaches school she's in a mild state of panic.  However, she's quite certain that if she just doesn't open her mouth, she'll be able to keep her tooth safe and sound from this alien scourge.  Trouble is, Mrs. Watson seems really nice.  And she keeps asking for kids to sing, or talk, or brag (things our first grader would LOVE to do).  It's only towards the end of the day that a surprising occurrence proves both Mrs. Watson's earthly status and gives the second grader a bit of a comeuppance.<br /><br />It's a cute little story wrapped up in a very fun package.  Now I've kinda enjoyed the books Bliss has illustrated up until now.  The aforementioned \\"Fine Fine School\\" was okay and \\"Don't Forget To Come Back\\", peaked the old imagination.  But so far, this book is my favorite of the lot.  And a lot of this is due to the fact that there ARE jokes that kids won't get in it.  Kids will love the visual gags on each and every page (for example, a loud-mouthed boy on a trip suddenly ends up covered in duct tape when he won't calm down) but I love the crazy details.  When the first grader timidly stares at the door of her new classroom, a poster with a picture of Shakespeare pointing at the viewer reads, \\"The Drama Club wants YOU for the Fall production of Marathon Man: A Chilling Tale of Suspense and Toothaches\\".  Similarly, when Mrs. Watson asks the class, \\"Who's ready to learn a song?\\", she's holding (and I seriously kid you not here), \\"London Calling\\", by J. Strummer.  Any picture book that makes a reference, however oblique, to The Clash has won my instantaneous and unwavering love for all time.<br /><br />So that's that.  Kids will love this book because of the words and storyline.  Adults will love this book because of the in-jokes (some of which, even THEY won't get).  And I love it because it's the perfect melding of two worlds.  The childlike and the sophisticated.  So pooh-pooh it for being \\"hip\\" all you want.

Every picture book, no matter how lowly or little known, has its advocates somewhere.  And for every well-illustrated title there are twenty illustrators just itching to get their hands on some raw materials so as to reinterpret the old standards.  That's why such collaborations can be thoughtful (as with variations on James Thurber's, \\"Many Moons\\") or completely mind-bogglingly awful (as with David McPhail's jaw-dropping take on \\"The Tale of Peter Rabbit\\").  Now ladies and gentlemen, I stand before you today with a confession.  An awful confession.  I have never so much as passed my eye over Diane Redfield Massie's, original 1963 edition of \\"The Baby Beebee Bird\\".  And therefore I am woefully inept at explaining to you, if you are so enamored of the original, why you should deign to glance at the 2000 re-illustrated edition.  All I can say is two little words that, to those of you who are in the know, will mean everything:  Steven Kellogg.  I mean, this is the guy who gave us skogs, mysterious tadpoles, and laughably large great danes.  The fellow who reintroduced so many of our children to the classic tall tales and knows how to illustrate with the greats.  With this particular story, he has created a creative rollercoaster of a text.  Is this going to be easy to read to large groups of squirming two-year-olds?  No, of course not.  But is it fun to read to a single child if you put a bit of creative voices and interpretations to it?  Yes.  Yes indeed.<br /><br />Now the story is great.  One day a tiny little baby beebee bird is taken to the zoo to live.  All day long the animals have been making their various animal-like sounds for fun (I especially liked that hippos say, \\"oompa oooompa ommpa oooompa\\").  So it stands to reason that after a hard day of being very loud, these animals would wish to snuggle down and get some shut eye.  No such luck.  Just as everyone gets nice and cozy, the baby beebee bird starts warming up.  With a ear-splitting, \\"beebeebobbibobbi\\", it begins to sing its little beebee heart out.  The misery of the animals notwithstanding (and there's nothing the giraffe can do to persuade the fowl) the bird sings all night, leaving everyone exhausted.  Fortunately, the daytime is just when the beebee bird falls asleep itself.  And that's when the other animals have a brilliant plan to put everything right.<br /><br />Now what I liked about the story was that when the animals decide to interrupt the beebee's sleep during the day, they don't do so by making their own growly sounds.  Instead, every single animal, whether snake or leopard, sings, \\"beebeebobbibobbi\\" all day.  It is clear that as can't-sleep-through-it sounds go, this one is the best.  Now some reviewers of this edition argue that the beebee bird isn't cute.  Such reviewers are, I say with the greatest respect, wrong.  Wrongdy wrongdy wrong wrong wrong.  This bird's a cutey-pie, no question.  Don't believe me?  Check out the cover.  There you can see the sweet l'il guy as he launches into yet another insanely tedious aria, all of his own composing.  All the animals here look great, with the possible exception of the adolescent zoo keeper.  Now the layout is a bit off-the-wall, true nuff.  But with some creativity, it makes for great reading.  Those passages where the beebee bird sings over all the animals' objections?  Recruit an older sibling to sing \\"beebeebobbibobbi\\" loudly and with feeling at just the right times.  Or a spouse.  Or the child you're reading to, for that matter.  Because, you see, no one should avoid a book simply because it doesn't fall into the Dick and Jane school of picture book layouts.  Have some pride, for goodness sake.<br /><br />So I declare Kellogg's reinterpretation a success.  Not that I wouldn't like to see the original as well.  But until that happy day arrives I'm content to snuggle down with this delightful 2000 edition and enjoy it to its fullest.  And for anyone whocares to join me, I say come one, come all.anyone who cares to join me, I say come one, come all. <br />	2005-04-20

And plenty that talk about segregation and sharecroppers in the 1930s.  But what there aren't a lot of, at this time, are children's books about The Great Migration that began in the early 1900s and continued up until the 1950s.  Few adults even know about this momentous turn in our nation's history, and fewer children still.  And while I'm still sitting and waiting for the quintessential Great Migration 5th grade text (preferably written by Russell Freedman, if at all possible), I'm pleased to announce that at long last we finally have a picture book that displays this most important of historical turns.  Artist Jerry Pinkney has taken Billie Holiday's second most famous song (I half wonder if a \\"Strange Fruit\\" picture book is in the works) and given it a story.  Now, the tale told here is not as cut and dried as some might like.  But true kudos to Mr. Pinkney for even thinking up such a fine way to tell of a historical moment that deserves greater attention in our children's historical textbooks.<br /><br />The song \\"God Bless the Child\\" is accompanied by the visual tale of a family of black sharecroppers living in the deep south.  Their work, as we can see, is hard and their lives worth more than what they get in such a hostile environment.  With the promise of work in the big city, the family packs their belongings onto the roof of their car and take off.  On one two-page spread (with no words) we see their abandoned home with the odds and ends of their former life left behind.  The next two-page spread (also without words) shows the car driving beneath an awe-inspiring scene of true gritty industrialism.  An elevated train winds its way over the busy streets below.  The parents of the kids get jobs working in factories and sewing shops.  The kids shine shoes or clamor for ice cream.  As the words say, \\"Money, you got lots o' friends / Crowdin' round the door/ When you're gone and spendin' ends / They don't come no more\\".  We can see that the kid who was shining shoes on one page had money to buy his friends treats.  But on the next page he apparently has no money and stares down from his building's fire escape to the friendless ground below.  But life gets better and in the end we can see one of the kids going off to school to get an education and take the opportunities that will be presented to him.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book a lot, but I did have a couple problems with it here and there.  The story is an interesting one.  I liked watching the family as the years passed.  I was fairly certain that the little boy who wears a hat with earflaps and chases butterflies in the South earlier becomes the slightly older boy who shines shoes later (and may even be the boy getting an education at the end).  But this is unclear.  Pinkney doesn't clarify any of the family members.  The parents are sometimes easy to identify (or at least the dad with the moustache is), but it takes some very careful and intense readings to figure out which child is which.  I wish that the story itself had been clearer.  If we are watching the little boy grow up and learn, it should be easy to understand.  That way the reader gets a sense of satisfaction out of the end of the tale.  But without knowing exactly who that kid is, you're left hanging.  The ending of the tale could be any child which, while nice and all, isn't as satisfying as seeing a character you've come to care for accomplish something.<br /><br />Otherwise, this book is lovely.  The pictures perfectly capture the time period.  The cd that comes with the book and contains Billie Holiday singing \\"God Bless the Child\\" is lovely.  But don't try to read the book as the song plays.  Pinkney didn't design this book to read along with the music.  There are sections where Ms. Holiday immediately leaps to a subsequent verse and the reader has to quickly skip through multiple two-page spreads to catch up.  Instead, the music's just a nice freebie with an already pleasant book.

Usually these stores would have huge bins of old shots of families, individuals, and places.  Finding the ones I thought were the most original, I bought them and gave each one its own name and history, entirely of my own making.  I could pore over a single photograph for hours, enlivening it with a background that I myself would never be able to prove or disprove.  But each photo was a staged affair.  Its participants knew that they were being photographed.  How different it would be to do the same thing, only with photos that highlighted a particular historical moment in our nation's history.  In \\"Remember: The Journey To School Integration\\", authorial god Toni Morrison does just that.  She takes photos that highlight the struggles and heroism of the civil rights activists (and their children) during the early years of southern integration and gives many of them their own little comment or story.  Taken individually the photos are eye-opening affairs, even for adults that lived through those turbulent years.  Taken as a whole they tell a tale that we should never forget.<br /><br />The book is, in its own words, \\"a unique pictorial and narrative journey that introduces children to a watershed period in American history\\".  In many children's books, such a title would begin with an Author's Note that speaks to adults about what the writer is attempting to accomplish.  Morrison takes a different route.  She speaks immediately to the child readers of this book.  \\"This book is about you\\", she explains.  She tells the kids about this dark period in American history.  She gives them a briefing in the history and the multitude of reasons why we should  never forget that this occurred.  Then the pictures begin.  They're all black and white images of a time long past.  Segregated schools, dilapidated and far from equal.  Small children like Ruby Bridges being led past screaming mobs of white people.  Sit-in protesters smashed with eggs and glasses of water by red faced restaurant employees.  Some of these pictures are familiar.  The white and colored drinking fountains, for example.  Some of them you'll have never seen before.  White boys chasing a black one on the first day of integration at Central High School.  An angry mob overturning a car containing black passengers.  Children in Ku Klux Klan robes.  But best of all are the photographs of the schoolchildren in the schools.  The wary glances shared between white and black students (as displayed on the cover).  The hand holding and learning under a single teacher.  You can tell by looking that there's still a long way to go but that first step has already been taken.  And Toni Morrison has helped to bring you there.<br /><br />Morrison's words usually fit each picture perfectly.  I thought she might have been giving a white boy carrying a boy carrying an anti-segregationist sign with his two friends a bit of a benefit of the doubt when she wrote, \\"I don't know.  My buddies talked me into this\\".  But it's nice of her to show that perhaps not all the white people presented here were evil.  She also shows photographs of white people marching in protest with black, so you've a sense that the civil rights movement spanned all races and creeds.  Her words give the child reader a chance to think and ponder what they see.  Everyone here has a voice.  Whether the reader agrees with that voice is not always a given.<br /><br />\\"Remember\\" is an excellent way to introduce kids to a harsh moment in our nation's past.  This type of format works perfectly with the subject matter.  Better still, this is one way of showing to kids how children were the battleground of one of the nation's most contentious movements.

For example, when you think of the author David Almond you pretty much have to think of one place in the world.  North-eastern England.  Books like \\"Kit's Wilderness\\" (one of the greatest children's books ever dreamt up) would be nothing without their location.  And the same goes for his particularly ambitious effort, \\"The Fire-Eaters\\".  This book is set, in his own words in, \\"a tatty place, a coaly beach by a coaly sea\\".  The characters talk with thick beautiful brogues.  Their lives and the lives of their ancestors are rooted to the beaches on which they were born.  Yet somehow this book could apply to any human being on any land on this small planet we call our own.  And that, ladies and gentlemen, is a testament to good writing.<br /><br />Keely Bay is set apart from the rest of the world.  It's the kind of place where a family can make a living simply by panning for the coal that appears naturally in the sea around it.  Bobby Burns, however, is bound for higher things.  He has been accepted into the nearby public school (along with some of his friends) and away from people like his friend Joseph.  Then the world comes crashing down around him.  When Bobby meets a mysterious fire-eater in a nearby city, that's the moment when his life starts to take a turn for the bizarre.  Suddenly his dad has a mysterious illness and far away in America the Russian Missle Crisis is taking place.  Bobby finds himself standing up to the oppressive corporeal punishment wielded at his school and dealing with the darkness that's coming far too close to his once perfect life.  Deftly, author David Almond weaves fact and fancy, history and mystical goings-on to create a story that's technically fictional but more real than any other book being published today.<br /><br />Almond as an author has always been fascinated with stories in which a young male protagonist has a deep connection with an older male father-figure.  In \\"Skellig\\" (his best known and most magical work) it was the mysterious bird-man found in the boy's garage.  In \\"Kit's Wilderness\\" it was both the boy's grandfather and the boy he befriended in the deep dark coal mines.  Here, Bobby befriends a mysterious stranger (like in \\"Skellig\\") but also has a deep meaningful relationship with his own father (like in \\"Kit's Wilderness\\").  Also, Almond tends to place a magical girl-figure in his books.  This one is no exception.  And it's funny... for all that Mr. Almond can be relied upon to create such regular cut-out characters, his books are some of the freshest and deeply moving out there today.  Every time I read a David Almond book I think it's the best thing I've ever read.  Until I happen to read the next David Almond book and the whole process starts again.  His talent is in his ability to weave plots, themes, and ideas together.  The fact that Almond makes his work seem so effortless is part of its charm.<br /><br />I doubt \\"The Fire-Eaters\\" is assigned all that often in school.  Which is a real pity, to be blunt.  Will kids who read it enjoy it?  I dunno.  Maybe.  The book isn't particularly hard to get through, though the language may strike some Yankee tots as hard to translate.  In the end though, I think it's perfect for the child reader that's just a hair touch smarter than his or her brethren.  If you happen to know a child who excels a little more than their fellows, try \\"The Fire-Eaters\\" out on them.  They may see the heights to which Almond aspires even more clearly than I do.

Yet year after year some of the best children's books out there concentrate on those large bodies of water available to the animals of the savanna.  This is the case with Graeme Base's remarkable, \\"The Water Hole\\" and Bob Graham's touching, \\"Tales From the Waterhole\\".  Added to the mix is \\"Water Hole Waiting\\" by authorial super duo Jane and Christopher Kurtz.  Of the aforementioned books, this is the one you'll want to go to if you actually want some factual information to go along with your watering studies.  Adept with a peppy rhyming text and some lovingly wielded pastels, the book's a fine addition to any child's water-hole-centric personal library.<br /><br />In the hot morning sun a young monkey is parched and longs to slake his thirst at the nearest watery hole.  However, his ever alert mama is quick to grab ahold of her restless charge, especially when he's about to run into some dangerous animals.  A quick grab to his arms saves him from \\"Hippo's yawning jaws\\".  A paw to the ear and he's not crushed under, \\"sharp hooves and quick kicks\\".  Catching ahold of his tale saves him from a lion, \\"who crouches close and lip-laps water between razor teeth\\".  And so on.  By the end of the day our little monkey is warier, but able to drink deeply with his fellow monkeys after all the other animals have had their share.<br /><br />The Kurtzes include a lovely little author's note at the back of the book detailing their own personal experiences in the bush.  They mention that the vervet monkeys (shown in this book) have a different warning call for each potential threat.  Also, water holes like the one shown here usually do serve animals that \\"take turns\\".  The Kurtz even suggest the website [...] for kids who want to see real water holes.  I did find myself wishing that this book had shown the monkeys and their different calls, but even without that fascinating tidbit the book is still a lovely read.  The pictures are bright and lovely, so thanks goes to illustrator Lee Christiansen.  One hopes to see more of Christiansen's work in picture books to come.<br /><br />If you've been trying to find just the right way to introduce kids to the animals and landscape of the East African savanna, this may be a delightful choice.  To be honest, I personally prefer the aforementioned \\"The Water Hole\\" by Graeme Base, but this is a lovely accompaniment to it.

That particular picture book is without comparison.  It is perfect and without flaw.  Yet since its publication Ms. Schwartz has retooled her artistic bent.  Instead of grand silly stories with grand silly (and large) black and white pictures, she now creates delicate tiny pen and ink drawing in contained colorful landscapes.  There's a lot of white space to contend with in a modern Amy Schwartz picture book.  Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing.  And certainly a book like, \\"A Glorious Day\\" has its charms.  But I yearn for the day Ms. Schwartz puts aside her toddler fare and return to her kindergarten roots again.  But that's just me.<br /><br />In \\"A Glorious Day\\" there is a large cast of characters to contend with.  If you've a good head on your shoulders then it shouldn't be too difficult to parse.  The first sentence in the book is, \\"One baby, two little girls, three big boys, four little boys, two cats, and a bird live in a small apartment building make of red brick.  They are all early risers\\".  And we're off!  With appealing zip and verve the reader bounces between the various homes, families, and kids in each of the important apartments.  Kids wake one another up, eat breakfasts of varying health (I gotta wonder who gets the potato chips), and begin their day.  Parents run to work or greet the babysitters.  Kids accompany their various guardians.  I won't sum it all up for you since (if you have children of your own you'll well know) a lot can happen in a single day.  The book chronicles the various crises (lost pet), triumphs, and mundane yet oddly riveting moments that categorize a toddler's day-to-day life.  By the end of the book the reader truly feels as if he or she has undergone all the things the kids here have, and the title of book seems to nicely sum up your final impression.<br /><br />The families in this book are oh so metropolitan.  Author Amy Schwartz hails from Brooklyn herself, and you can remain confident that she knows whereof she speaketh.  From the concrete park to the structure of the buildings, this is a world that will be comfortingly familiar to some and enticingly new and different to others.  I also liked the time and attention Ms. Schwartz has paid to multiculturalism here.  The book has two white families, one interracial family, and one black family.  I would've loved to have seen a gay family as well, but I guess a person can't ask for everything.  What's really impressive here is that Schwartz seems to know these people really well.  You can check out how in one household everything's neat as a pin while in another things are a little more haywire.  As for the text, it's sweet.  I particularly enjoyed the moment where Henry's mother points out to her son that a fellow toddler has \\"lovely underpants\\".  Says Henry, with a touch of the self-aware about him, \\"Henry wear underpants sooner or later\\".<br /><br />Any parent who has ever had a child will understand this book.  Now it is not, I'll grant, on a level of the magnificent \\"Bea and Mr. Jones\\".  But you should never judge an artist solely on their early works of genius.  \\"A Glorious Day\\" has its own charm.  It tells a story that will be instantly recognized and appreciated by its intended audience.  And it makes for a lovely little reading.

Too often, rather peculiar titles will be handed to little ones as kiddie fare (paging \\"Kira-Kira\\") when such notions are not only laughable but somewhat bizarre.  I mean, if every book with a kid hero was meant to be read by kids then by extension shouldn't every book containing an elderly protagonist be read by the aged and infirm?  Which brings us to the delightful picture book, \\"Lucy Dove\\".  \\"Lucy Dove\\" actually flies in the face of my previous statement since I truly feel that every human being, the elderly included, would benefit from a perusal of this perfect meeting of folktale and ethereal illustration.  This is one of those picture books you simply do not see every day.<br /><br />There once was a foolish, superstitious, and incredibly wealthy gentleman (or \\"laird\\").  But this is not his story.  You see, the laird was the kind of fellow who felt he needed a bit of luck to keep himself happy.  And what better way is there to be lucky than to own a pair of lucky trousers?  And what better trousers could they be than the kind sewn together under a full moon in the graveyard of old St. Andrew's church?  So the laird sent a proclamation offering a whole heaping helping of gold to anyone who'd do the deed the next moonlit night.  Which brings us to our heroine, Lucy Dove.  Lucy was not exactly in the first fair bloom of her youth, and she was seriously considering retiring from the seamstress line of work.  Problem was, she didn't exactly have a pension.  So when she heard the laird's proposal she thought it was a mighty fine deal.  The next full moon, Lucy's out in that churchyard ah-sewing up some trousers.  Until a very nasty someone tries to stop her in her work.  And it has quite long claws.<br /><br />For anyone who reads this tale and then proceeds to attempt to find its predecessors, please know that according to author Janice Del Negro, Lucy is an original character and merely based on traditional Celtic and British sources.  Says her bookflap, \\" `Lucy Dove' is her version of a traditional Celtic tale she has been telling for years, one that evolved from her search for stories with active heroines to offset the passive female protagonists of many popular fairy tales\\".  One might point out that even when you do find a gutsy heroine in a tale, she's usually a young lovely maiden and very rarely a witty fast-thinking crone like our dear Lucy here.  Moreover, the villain of this tale (a smelly bogle with a tendency to repeat himself) is simultaneously scary and pitiable.  This is in large part due to illustrator Leonid Gore's remarkable illustrations.  Creating the finest distinctions between shadow and light with luminescent acrylics, Gore's tale is all soft and scary at the same time.  When the bogle is told by Lucy that people speak of it often, the picture shows it resting a sharp chin on the back of its hand, like a child pining for a story.  Little details as well as grand ones make this book especially wonderful to view.<br /><br />I know that there are roughly 78.4 billion Halloween picture books for children out there.  But if you're thinking of doing something a little different in the autumnal season, definitely cast your eye over the fabulous, \\"Lucy Dove\\".

Small electronic pets.  Plastic accoutrements that somehow incorporate the word \\"jelly\\" into their titles.  And while I am an ancient 26 years of age with only dim recollections of my idyllic midwestern youth, I think I can say with perfect certainty that there is one subject that very very few kids obsess over.  Ballooning.  When was the last time your child begged you for a lifetime subscription to (actual publications) \\"Ballooning Magazine\\" or \\"Aerostat Hot Air Balloon Magazine\\"?  This isn't to say that when the local carnival comes to town, some kids wouldn't leap at the chance of hopping into one of those balloon rides that go up and down.  But will they seriously seek out literature that feeds this all-consuming hunger for all things dirigible?  William Pene du Bois apparently thought so.  And so, with his 1948 Newbery Award winning, \\"The Twenty-One Balloons\\", Pene du Bois gives us a tale that is part Jules Verne part H.G. Wells with just a touch of Rube Goldberg for spice.  And while I doubt that many children today will pore over the intricate technical aspects of this otherwise fun ride, they will at least be intrigued by its tale of a man, his dream, and his encounter with a truly original society.<br /><br />If there was one thing Professor William Waterman Sherman was tired of, it was teaching mathematics to little children.  For years and years he'd done it and finally, once retired, he was given a chance to fulfill a lifelong dream.  Sherman would outfit himself a fabulous balloon.  It would be the second largest ever commissioned and would carry a small wicker house, in which Sherman would be able to sail in perfect peace and comfort.  Containing a great deal of food, the hope on his part was to be able to sail around the world for at least a year without having to come into contact with another human being.  On August 15, 1883 he sets out above the Pacific in a single balloon to live in the sky.  On September 8, 1883 he is picked up by a passing American freighter in the Atlantic while, \\"clinging to the debris of twenty deflated balloons\\".  How is this possible?  Where did the balloons come from?  How did he travel around the world so quickly?  And what stories has he to tell?  \\"The Twenty-One Balloons\\" is Sherman's wild, impossible, and truly original tale of his time spent on the island of Krakatoa, mere days before it exploded sky high.  And what he found there will astound.<br /><br />Pene du Bois begins this book with a rather touching caveat.  He points out that just prior to publication his publishers couldn't help but notice similarities between this story and F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story, \\"The Diamond As Big As the Ritz\\".  Pene du Bois admits that some of the similar details are a bit striking, but that he really hadn't heard of Fitzgerald's version before.  A quick perusal of the two stories is enough to convince me that Pene du Bois is certainly telling the truth.  Though in both tales we view rich opulent societies that own a mountain filled with diamonds and use their wealth to maintain both secrecy and a higher standard of life, Fitzgerald's story is obviously a slyly clever critique of his contemporaries while Pene du Bois concocts a delightful confection of various \\"what ifs\\".  Kids reading \\"The Twenty-One Balloons\\" will instantly wish to find themselves on Krakatoa (pre-volcanic eruption, of course) and to eat at a different restaurant establishment every night.<br /><br />The best word for this particular book is \\"innovative\\".  When Sherman crash lands, nude, on Krakatoa, he meets its European inhabitants.  Because they are so incredibly rich (all due to Krakatoa's diamond core) they spend their days inventing wild games and conveniences while indulging in delightful foods and expansions of the mind.  Pene du Bois's original illustrations bring Krakatoa brilliantly to life while also explaining the technical aspects of everything from balloon merry-go-rounds to beds that change their own sheets.  Though I sincerely doubt that any publisher has gone so far as to print this book without the original pictures, make absolutely certain that your book has them if you're going to purchase it.  In some ways they brought to mind the delightful scribbles of Ronni Solbert in the equally amusing children's book, \\"The Pushcart War\\".<br /><br />Many kids find themselves saddled with the assignment of choosing and reading one Newbery Award winning book for school.  And a child could do far worse than choose the charming, \\"The Twenty-One Balloons\\".  I like to think that the book is as much fun to read as it was for William Pene du Bois to write.

First and foremost, I'd like to rant a little.  Why oh why did Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson feel a need to write a prequel to \\"Peter Pan\\" if they obviously didn't care about the original story?  I mean, if the two had wanted to write a sequel (public domain, I loves ye) they could have done so with relatively few problems.  But instead they went and decided to tell the story of how Peter a) learned to fly b) met Captain Hook and c) came to Neverland.  And this might have been fine and dandy except that it strays so far from the original story that it's almost (but not completely) its own entity.  Now this review of mine is chock full of spoilers.  So if you're reading it with the hopes of being pleasantly surprised on page 436 by one of the plot twists you'd better stop reading now.  Which is too bad because I'm about to go into a long gorgeous rant.  I love it when a book makes me mad enough to get into rant-mode (\\"The Yellow Star\\" by Carmen Agra Deedy, for example) and this one has turned on the rant-o-meter full blast.  So sit back ladies and gentlemen and hear a tale of a well-intentioned book that screwed up royally and mightily.<br /><br />First, the story.  In it, an orphan (the first non-\\"Peter Pan\\"ish element) named Peter finds himself and some other boys on a ship bound for a distant land.  On the ship is a pretty young girl named Molly, who catches Peter's eye.  The girl, as it turns out, is connected to a mysterious trunk that sits in the locked room in the ship.  Containing a material called starstuff, the trunk is desired by a distant pirate named Black Stache.  Stache is hunting Peter's ship for the treasure, and it's up to Peter and Molly to defeat a multitude of bad guys and keep the powerful starstuff out of the hands of the enemy.<br /><br />I think I'll list the problems with the book one by one just for kicks.  So here we go....<br /><br />1. As we all know, Peter is the boy who never grew up.  In \\"Peter Pan\\" he still has his baby teeth (which he gnashes with great frequency) and proudly speaks of being young.  In this book he's basically a teenager.  A teenager who, when he meets someone new, will automatically say that he's a year OLDER than that person.  This is exactly the opposite of what the real Peter Pan would do.  In fact, it's mind bogglingly bizarre to even include it.  And this Peter, by the way, checks out half-naked chicks and, regarding Molly, \\"like the way her neck smelled\\".<br /><br />2. Captain Hook, by and large, is threatening.  And why is this?  Because he's the perfect gentleman.  He has perfect hair (long black curls), the perfect clothes (they say he looks like Charles II), and can play the harpsichord.  But in this book, in his previous incarnation, he's so dirty and messy that he literally leaves cow carcasses in his bed.  Barry and Pearson took the world's most threatening pirate and turned him into the world's most stereotypical one.  A deeply misguided move.<br /><br />3. The crocodile never eats a clock.  An odd thing to leave out.<br /><br />4. For all the charms of the illustrations, artist Greg Call made Stache and Slank (who weren't benefiting from their similar names to begin with) look exactly the same, save their moustache lengths.<br /><br />5. The scene on the cover of the book never happens.  Trust me on this one.  It just doesn't.<br /><br />6. Neverland, people, is on a distant planet.  If it were in the sea, anyone could get to it.  Now I'll grant that maybe the natives in this book decided to keep Neverland out of European hands by flying it into outer space.  Maybe.  But if so, Barry and Pearson would have mentioned it.  At 452 pages it wasn't like they were leaving anything out.<br /><br />7. By the end of the book, it is clear that Peter is the only one who will not age.  Um.... what about the other Lost Boys who stay with him?  Will they?<br /><br />8. The writing in this book is, in and of itself, not so hot.Here's an actual sentence: \\"Also on the table were also two small, delicate models of sailing ships...\\".  How many also's does one sentence need?<br /><br />9. Barry and Pearson attempt to take the worn \\"savage\\" stereotype and infuse it with a little post-colonial awareness.  Unfortunately, they end up with natives that dress in \\"filthy loincloths\\" and end up trying to kill everyone anyway (but for noble reasons, this time).  It's insulting AND informed!  Double trouble.<br /><br />10. The chapters are sometimes one page long.  That's less a flaw than just laziness though.<br /><br />11. For some reason there's a back-and-forth sequence involving the magic trunk that takes approximately 100 pages and hardly even glances at our supposed heroes.  Why did we need two groups of villains, by the way?  Obviously because Stache hasn't the literary presence of the superior Captain Hook.<br /><br />12. Apparently a pirate named Bates has been abandoned on the island.  Barry and Pearson appear to have forgotten that he was sent out to explore a path.  Hence, he's been forgotten by his own authors.  Not a good sign.<br /><br />Whew!  Sorry, but that was all I could come up with for now.  Now none of this is to say that the book doesn't contain an exciting swashbuckling scene or two.  It most certainly does.  But when the action turns for a fourth or fifth time to mermaids trying to overturn a boat... well it gets a bit old.  But here's where people will say to me, \\"Yes, but my children LOVED this book\\".  They may well have.  It's a lot of fun, sometimes.  But here's the deal:  It is not an accurate precursor to \\"Peter Pan\\" and it is not well-written as a whole.  It is, in fact, overrated.  Overrated and doggone long.  And a little lame too.<br /><br />Look.  If Barry and Pearson has included some kind of a preface saying that this was revisionist Peter Pan, I'd be fine with it.  But they don't.  So any comparison to Barre's original suffers.  If you want a book that plays around with old Peter Pan themes in a deeply creative way, just pick up Cornelia Funke's, \\"Inkheart\\".  At least she remained faithful to the famous stories she referenced.  But \\"Peter and the Starcatchers\\" is just another example of a perfectly good adult author (or two) floundering in the waters of children's literature, hoping to make a quick buck.  No deep creativity has gone down here.  Not even original characters, for the most part.  If you want an inoffensive work of fiction that has fast-paced action scenes and familiar names, this book's your best bet.  But if you want something original (like the aforementioned \\"Inkheart\\") look elsewhere.

The phases of the moon.  And the love children will always have for naughty, bad, not-so-very-nice behavior.  It is this love that has made \\"The Cat In the Hat\\" a picture book classic, and that has raised David Shannon's, \\"No, David!\\" from obscurity to beloved bedtime must.  And though \\"Rotten Ralph\\" is not original in terms of bad-pet-wreaks-havoc (the best version of which, by the way, is Joan Aiken's, \\"Arabel's Raven\\"), it is certainly one of the more original and visually stimulating of its kind.  There will always be certain fuddy duddy parents out there that dislike \\"Rotten Ralph\\" on the basis of its content (i.e. naughtiness to them=evil incarnate).  But there will also always be parents who recognize why children love Ralph's wicked ways, and shall purchase accordingly.<br /><br />Ralph is a cat that, as his owner Sarah puts it is, \\"sometimes ... very hard to love\\".  He delights in tormenting those around him.  When Sarah practices ballet, Ralph makes fun of her.  When she has a tea party, he takes precisely one bite out of each cookie.  When she's swinging (and I'm not entirely certain that the term \\"rotten\\" quite covers this one) he saws off the branches of the tree she hangs from.  All this comes to a head when the family, with Ralph in tow, goes to the circus.  Ralph engages in out-and-out highly despicable behavior, causing Sarah's father to insist that the fam abandon Ralph to the circus itself.  By doing so, Ralph learns humility and how to fend for himself.  And when at last he is reunited with the ever-caring Sarah, he tries not to be so very rotten after all. \\"Except for sometimes when Mother cooked lobster for dinner\\".<br /><br />Author Jack Gantos originally wrote this tale in 1976, and it allowed him to jump start his lucrative career as a children's author.  Since that time he has gone on to write the incredibly well-written \\"Joey Pigza\\" series (if you haven't you MUST run out and read \\"Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key\\" at once!) as well as the fabulous young adult autobiography, \\"Hole In My Life\\".  And it all started with one malicious and very naughty kitty.  Ralph's actions are, of course, despicable.  In fact, they're often so ludicrously terrible that they strike great guffaws of laughter from the audience.  Of course, the story feels like exactly what it is.  A writer's first picture book.  It's a fine little piece but it doesn't have the ease and sophistication of the later \\"Ralph\\" books.  In fact, most parents probably wouldn't have even noticed its existence if Mr. Gantos hadn't been paired with illustrator Nichole Rubel.  Ms. Rubel has worked on other children's books, it's true.  But when she has reached the end of her too brief life and joined the choir invisible, one cannot help but think that what Ms. Rubel will be most remembered for will be her participation in the \\"Rotten Ralph\\" series.  After all, she imbues him with such life, verve, and wanton (not to say gleeful) destruction that long after reading the story, the image of him is burned deeply into one's brain.  Now, the book does suffer from containing zippo people of color (unless you count the questionable fellow on a camel, midway through the tale) so don't expect much in the way of multiculturalism here.  Then again, this is a problem through the entire series, so I shouldn't have been too surprised.  And the pictures do sometimes strike you as slightly modified William Steigs (later Steig, of course) in their wavy nightmarish way.  So if you've a child who fears the wiggly, avoid this book at all costs.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a perfectly good story about a perfectly awful pet.  Unlike some of the other \\"Ralph\\" books, the cat in this tale faces a mighty good comeuppance for his crimes.  Kids will enjoy his foibles just as much as they clamor to read about some of his other adventures.

If you don't, then you're in for a treat.  Having conquered the concerns of pup loving people everywhere, Mr. Graham shifts his attention here to the African savanna.  Or, to be more precise, to the lives of the animals that live and play in it.  With the summer months here and the lure of the old waterhole ah-calling, this book faithfully documents five hot weather stories that many a child will identify with and many more will enjoy.  Though you may not think it to look at them, animals are just as concerned about showing off, playing soccer, family trips, and going shopping for clothes (with mom) as people are.  If not more so.<br /><br />Our hero is Morris the crocodile and his family and friends.  In \\"Fruit Salad Swimsuit\\", the waterhole has just opened for business and mom is paging through the Dry Season mail-order catalog in the hopes of finding a new swimsuit.  However, when the item arrives it causes a bit of a ruckus between otherwise good friends Morris and Billy the turtle.  The story \\"Soccer Match\\" begins with a familiar situation (keeping an eye on a younger sibling) then takes a huge twist when the children of the savanna find themselves playing their toughest opponents yet.... their mothers.  In \\"Daredevil Stunt\\", Morris attempts to catch the eye of Wendy Warthog with an oddly planned stunt.  \\"Vacation\\" shows that no matter how badly your own family situation is, there's always somebody who has it worse.  Like Waldo Wildebeest (who always goes on vacation with \\"zillions of relatives\\" and ends up watching ALL their kids).  Finally, with \\"Long Rains Party\\", Morris goes pants shopping with his mom and ends up not entirely displeased by the result.<br /><br />Now the whole beauty of these stories comes in part from Mr. Graham's subdued illustrations.  The watercolors and pen and inks draw easy-to-understand situations that will look instantly comfortable and familiar.  Morris's mother is usually wearing a dress that displays an askew bra strap and his house has just the right amount of toys and clutter to feel like a home.  Even when characters fight, as Morris and Billy attempt to do at one point, they're so haphazard and clueless that a line like, \\"They went outside and beat each other up\\", is belied by the multiple pictures of swings and misses.  That and the fact that the next line says, \\"Well, they circled and shuffled and grunted, and they groaned and swished at the air\\".  Put your minds at rest, high strung parents everywhere.  This book does not condone fighting.  I just want to make it clear that for all their simplicity, Graham's pictures know just how to show comfort, mixed emotions, and action on hot African afternoons.<br /><br />The stories are a lot of fun too.  As I mentioned before, the story \\"Soccer Match\\" begins one way and ends another.  With Morris's mother telling him to keep an eye on his brother Little Bob, you expect this to be one of those stories in which the older brother sticks up for/grows to appreciate his younger sibling.  But suddenly, midway through the tale (as if Graham himself grew bored of the trite telling) all the mothers of the kids come stomping in, still wearing their dressy clothing, and proceed to beat their children in a rousing game of soccer 17-1 (the kids make a final point at the end and everyone's happy).  Few stories for children are this inventive.  Few stories would also let the mom's win so obviously.<br /><br />So if you'd like a lovely summery set of picture book tales to tell your little ones, \\"Tales From the Waterhole\\" is your best bet.  It creates a safe place where kids can play without any adult supervision whatsoever, and places it in an entirely believable little world of its own.

Under normal circumstances I only write reviews for children's books on Amazon.com, leaving my teen reviews for such websites as Epinions.com.  But \\"Gypsyworld\\" is so much fun that I hate to think that only teens would get something out of it.  I know many a wise-cracking 8-year-old who'd like this book just as much as someone about to enter their first year at Yale.  Author Julian Thompson creates a delightful mystery involving a peculiar land and the procurement of five curious teenagers.  In solving the mystery, the book becomes an eloquent statement about the world and renewable resources.  Altogether, it's a book with a lovely message that never gets preachy or self-righteous.  A delightful read for a rainy day.<br /><br />One day, parents everywhere opened their newspapers to an ad that read simply, \\"SELL YOUR KID TO THE GYPSIES\\".  And so they did.  Two gypsies, in fact.  Josip and Marina purchase three kids of their very own, steal another 2 away, and then it's off in their clunky RV to take the kids to a place called Gysyworld.  When the five teens become aware of their surroundings, Josip and Marina (democratically elected King and Queen of the gypsies, respectively) refuse to tell them which kids were bought and which were simply taken.  So all the kids know is this: They've been taken from their homes to a beautiful place where the food is good, the air is clean, and the people get along reasonably well.  None of the five are tied up in any way or told what to do with themselves.  But it's up to them to solve the mystery of why they've come and what the deal is with Gypsyworld.  I mean, where is this place?  Why won't anyone in the town make eye contact or speak with any of the kids?  And why do mysterious strangers enter the house at night, speaking wildly and angrily in foreign tongues?  It all leads to desperate actions, a daring escape, and a final redemption that leaves everyone happy at the end.<br /><br />Though it may not sound it from that summary, this is a book about caring for the environment and world around us.  The more the reader learns about Gypsyworld, the more important it becomes to the kids and to the world itself.  In some ways, author Julian Thompson is better as the mysterious parts of the story than the conservation sections.  And the opening is wonderful.  It consists of a careful retelling of exactly how Josip and Marina went about procuring themselves some children.  Now, there is the matter of the whole \\"gypsy\\" term.  As the characters make clear later on, Josip and Marina aren't gypsies in the capital G sense of the world.  They share some, but not all, of the ancestry.  I think it fair to say that no one reading this book is going to come away with it thinking that real Gypsies go about kidnapping children.  Still, the premise of the story hinges on an old heavily out-of-date stereotype, and that's sometimes a little hard to let go of.  It all comes down to just how offensive you personally find an author hijacking the term \\"gypsy\\".  Personally, since Thompson makes it clear that these gypsies are not Gypsies, I didn't have any qualms.  But some readers, I admit, might feel differently.<br /><br />In any case, if you'd like a lovely pro-Earth, environmentalist, love nature-type book, this is a great bet.  It's beautifully written, a lot of fun, and a swell mystery to boot.  You also won't find anything quite like it anywhere else.

292481:US	49148452	R2UZ0U451I767I	1929766009	303754455	Casey at the Bat: A Ballad of the Republic Sung in the Year 1888 (Caldecott Honor Book)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	But there is no joy in Mudville	In my own personal experience, I first came across meticulous illustrator/reinterpreter Christopher Bing when he decided to retell, \\"The Story of Little Black Sambo\\".  And regardless of whether or not you feel his version was worthwhile or simply an example of offensive materials in luxurious packaging, there's no denying that the book was researched, culled, and created with many gallons of sweat.  So when I decided to go back and read Bing's earlier accomplished retelling of Ernest Lawrence Thayer's, \\"Casey At the Bat\\", I thought I knew what to expect.  I mean, sure the book had won a Caldecott Honor.  But I had little doubt that I'd find it simply a nice little story with pretty pictures.  Instead, I was blown away.  Knocked out of my socks.  Jolted right out of my chair.  In short, this book exceeded by wildest expectations.  To read this story in this version is to find yourself wondering just how many man hours Christopher Bing sacrificed from his personal life to retell Thayer's story in full.  You will not only enjoy this particular book.  You will find yourself poring through it for hours on end.  I kid you not.<br /><br />There is something quintessentially American about old bat-swinging Casey.  Something about his gall and bombast that really strikes home (har har).  The world, especially the American world, is filled with Casey's ancestors.  Fellas (and gals) that think they're really the cat's pajamas and ruin everything through their blowhardy natures.  The book begins with those awe-inspiring words, \\"The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Mudville nine that day...\\".  And we're off.  As Thayer's poem plays out, Bing's beautiful faux early newspaper engravings show the action as if each scene were an illustration in the Mudville Sunday Monitor.  Further enlivening the text are old baseball ads, beautifully faked and yellowed editorial and informative clippings, baseball ephemera (tickets, membership cards, baseball cards, etc.), and real pins from the earliest days of the American sport.  None of this detracts from the tension however.  As in the story, Mudville is in dire straits, only barely hanging on when Casey comes to bat.  He lets the first two pitches fly right past him, ratcheting up the tension and his own (potential) glory.  Then the final pitch flies and we hear those magnificent final lines: \\"Oh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright; The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light; And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout;  But there is no joy in Mudville - mighty Casey has struck out\\".<br /><br />For all that the illustrations themselves would fit beautifully into an actual newspaper from 1888, they're really surprisingly gripping in the context of the tale.  Everyone in the pictures is dressed in garb appropriate to the time period.  Casey himself sports a magnificent handlebar moustache and is noticeably older than many of the baseball players that bat today.  There's a wonderful moment too when the final pitch is about to be thrown and you find yourself looking deeply into Casey's penetrating glare.  It is truly a face grown, \\"cold and stern\\", and ready to hit the next ball that flies.  Kids who read this book, or have it read to them, will have zippo difficulty following the book's action and excitement.  In fact, that's pretty much a credit to Thayer himself.  Name yourself another late nineteenth-century poet who has created a series of verses as catchy to our ears today as they were when first produced.  I ask you.<br /><br />In this world of steroid enhanced muscles and drug-influenced hitting, baseball could use a little nostalgia.  A way of taking us back to its beginnings, when it was all about the game.  I can think of no better way to do this than Bing's glorious tribute to everything that is good and bad about the American spirit.  Kids will like the story and pictures.  Adults will find themselves reading and rereading the tiny articles that talk about everything from the addition of baseball gloves into the game to the nomination of a second umpire.

And yet, this is not the case.  In fact, it's rather rare for someone of Lunda Sue Park's stature to go about writing for children younger than her usual fare.  It's almost as if she's slumming.  But Park (who won the Newbery for \\"A Single Shard\\") has discovered what most winners fail to realize.  That a picture book can be every bit as morally complex and intricate as a 230-some page novel.  All it takes is excellent writing and an illustrator who knows their stuff.  Which makes, \\"The Firekeeper's Son\\" a perfect example of a picture book that does everything right and ends up wowing the reader with its intensity.<br /><br />Sang-hee lives in a small, unassuming, and peaceful village in Korea.  One day, his father informs him that their little space is infinitely important (a fact that Sang-hee has a bit of difficulty believing).  But his father is absolutely correct.  Located beside the sea and just next to the first of a row of mountains, it understood that in the event of a seaward attack by Korea's enemies, this village is the first line of defense.  That is why, every night, Sang-hee's father climbs the nearby mountain and lights a fire that can be seen for miles.  Then, someone on the next mountain will see that fire and light their own.  This continues all the way to the king's palace where, if the king sees the last mountain lit, he'll know that all is well.  Of course, if the fire is not lit, the king would immediately send his soldiers out to battle with the enemy.  Now this system has gone on for generations, but Sang-hee is not content.  He would love to see the king's glorious soldiers more than anything else in the world.  Then, one night, his father hurts his ankle while climbing up the mountain.  Sang-hee is given the task of lighting the fire himself, but as he nears the pile of dried twigs he thinks about how much he'd like to see a soldier up close.  And the hot coals are slowly burning out...<br /><br />The book weighs an individual's personal wants and fantasies against the greater good of the whole, and does so beautifully.  You completely understand Sang-hee's dilemma.  On the one hand, there's the fact that not lighting the fire would be a callous lie.  On the other hand, \\"Maybe there is a soldier who would be glad for a chance to visit the sea\\".  Park's story is based on factual information, as she mentions in her Author's Note.  However, the system by which bonfires informed the king of potential attacks was, in real life, far more complex than the one featured here.  As Park herself mentions, \\"additional fires could be lit to convey further information, so the court would know not only which province was facing danger but things like the size of the enemy forces and how well armed they were!\\".  She provides additional resources for further reading.<br /><br />It was a real stroke of luck that Park was paired with illustrator Julie Downing too.  Downing plays with lush watercolors and pastels that perfectly convey not only the cool blue nights Sang-hee must run through, but also the glow of the slowly dying coals and eventual hot orange flames.  If you look on the cover of the book, you can see dream soldiers fighting in the fire and the bright orange flickers reflected in the black of Sang-hee's eyes.  Downing's images are the perfect compliment to Park's deeply rich story.<br /><br />As historical fiction picture books go, this one has to be one of the most beautiful on record.  If you'd like a picture book that lures those sometimes hard to interest boy readers, but is just as doggone interesting to the girls of the world, this book's a safe bet.  It's beautiful to look at and remarkably complex to contemplate.  Art in the purest sense.dried twigs he thinks about how much he'd like to see a soldier up close.

Books	4	19	21	N	N	Big time baby kissing	There are books out there that are meant to be told to large audiences of wide-mouthed children.  And there are books to be told to small groups of addled youngsters.  But most interesting sometimes are the books written with the intent of being read to one child and one child alone.  Such a book is \\"I Kissed the Baby\\".  The ultimate in interactive toddlerhood, the story is best when told to a rhyming bouncy beat, with the child on your lap laughing all the while.  It's a simple book with easy words, bright colors, and large illustrations.  Perfect, in fact, for getting the youngest of youngsters interested in books.<br /><br />Animals comment on their interactions with a baby.  The first, a fish, exclaims proudly, \\"I saw the baby!  Did you see the baby?\\".  He's answered with a rhyming yes and then we see a different pair of animals.  As you go you hear that some creatures have fed the baby, sung to the baby, tickled the baby, and finally (best of all) kissed the baby.  A mother duck is the one who gets that particular honor, and there's a great two page spread of her leaning down to give the baby duck a great big, \\"Ppfffwah!\\" of a smacker.<br /><br />Simple stuff.  But the joy of the book is that even as characters discuss what they've done for the baby, the person reading the book to their child can do those exact same things.  Especially the kiss.  There's such a build up to the moment that parents would be seriously amiss if they didn't kiss their babies in much the same manner.  Be sure you read this book to children who are young enough not to mind being referred to as \\"babies\\", by the way.  Older children are certain to shy away from this book in the hopes of more mature reading.  But \\"I Kissed the Baby\\" is as cute as a bug's ear and contains some lovely cadences.  A treasure for all who discover it.	2005-03-31

Let me share a fact about myself from my youth.  When I was a child there were certain plots in books and movies that I just could not take:  Cats In Peril (or CIP).  One of my favorite picture books, \\"The Patchwork Cat\\", was beloved by me but still raised my inner hackles because it contained a CIP.  The years passed and I came to believe that CIPs no longer had the power to bring me to tears.  Enter \\"The Cat Who Walked Across France\\".  Giving it a cursory glance, I was not overly impressed.  The story might be nice but the pictures were just the kind of pseudo-Impressionism I tend to avoid.  Then again, it was on the New York Public Library's list of one of the best children's books of 2004.  And because I am slowly working my way through that list, I decided to give it a shot.  What I expected was just your average everyday run-of-the-mill-cat-in-France picture book.  What I found was a CIP that uses excellent storytelling and strangely compelling illustrations to leave you in tears by the end of the tale.  A book that far exceeds expectations.<br /><br />The cat grew up by the sea in St. Tropez, France.  It had a nice old woman to look after it and a good comfortable life.  When the old woman dies, the cat is sent to the far North, around Rouen, along with her possessions.  And by that carelessness that too often occurs at the hands of busy humans, the cat is forgotten.  Fortunately, after some begging and escapes from the local dogs, the feline decides to head back to the south.  In true cat fashion he doesn't examine why he is doing this.  Only that it's something that must be done.  The rest of the book follows the cat as he travels from cityscape to countryside and everything in between.  And by the end he finds a home not too different from the one he used to know.<br /><br />Yeah, I was tearing up at the end.  I admit it.  First of all, author Kate Banks is a genius.  She spares us too many details on the uncomfortable aspects of the cat's life.  For example, when he flees dogs or mean children there isn't any heavy emotional contemplation at those times.  But all the same, you find your heart wrung out by sentences like, \\"When it rained, the cat took refuge under a friendly rafter.  He was lonely and tired.  But when the storm passed, he would march on, driven by the taste of the salty air that blew off the water and coated the bench behind the stone house by the edge of the sea\\".  By the end of the book I felt very emotionally wrought.  But happy.  There's a great joy in seeing a small creature overcome sorrow and solitude on its own.  A great joy indeed.  As for the illustrations, they fit the words perfectly.  As I mentioned before, I was initially put off by the thick paints that portray the landscapes of this book.  But the colors are lovely and the paints rich and hearty.  The cat is a little gray creature and sometimes you can spend some time searching a page or two in an effort to figure out where it's hiding.  I cannot think of a better illustrator to have accompanied this author.<br /><br />For a good companion cat picture book, consider pairing this tale with \\"The Cat Who Liked Potato Soup\\" by Barry Root (and yet another \\"cat who\\" book NOT written by Lillian Jackson Braun).  Both stories feature rather realistic felines and the old people who have loved them.  If you've a child that isn't overly affected by CIP books like this one, then do not hesitate to pluck yourself up a copy today.  A truly lovely work.aspects of the cat's life.

The world contains a variety of easy reader books.  Of these, most are pure drivel, some are fine but not terribly imaginative, and a very scant few, but the few that count, are remarkably witty for their simple constructions.  \\"Biscuit\\" falls into the middle category.  It's not going to knock your socks off or even surprise you any.  But it contains what may well be one of the most adorable puppies ever to grace an \\"I Can Read Book\\".  Reviewing \\"Biscuit\\" is difficult, if only because it's hardly any more sophisticated than those mind-numbingly dull \\"Spot\\" books by Eric Hill.  So the verdict is, as I see it, that if you've found that your child adores reading \\"Biscuit\\" books (and there is quite a series of them out there) you could undoubtedly suffer a worse fate in life.  It's a rather sweet story.<br /><br />Meet Biscuit.  A puppy with pretensions of wide-awakefullness.  As a little girl attempts to cajole her pup into bed, Biscuit (by mere woofing alone) comes up with a long list of demands.  A snack, a drink, a story, and several other requests later, Biscuit is alone in bed but isn't sleepy in the least.  So he high-tails it up to bed to tug on his mistress's bed sheets.  Then, just as she peeks over, he snuggles down for a good night's rest.<br /><br />Like so many other books, this story takes an animal and places it in a situation that children will be familiar with the world over.  Now, illustrator Pat Schories's pictures are very cute, yes.  And author Alyssa Satin Capucilli's words are simple and easy for children to understand.  But allow me to point out that the lesson taught in this tale was done in a far more amusing and (dare I say) adorable manner with Shelley Moore Thomas's easy reader book, \\"Good Night, Good Knight\\".  Not that the two books are mutually exclusive.  If your child has already fallen in love with Biscuit's antics (I'm just counting the days until there's a PBS tv show about him) then this is a cute tale to reread again.  But if you're casually searching for good beginning reader tales and you'd like a story similar but better than this one, go get yourself a little \\"Good Night, Good Knight\\" for your troubles.  This is a nice story.  Just not a great one.you're casually searching for good beginning reader tales and you'd like a story similar but better than this one, go get yourself a little \\"Good Night, Good Knight\\" for your troubles.

You could have heard a pin drop.  Now there were roughly ten or so children ranging in age from nine to toddlerhood and amongst these not a single child (that would admit it) knew that great family friendly and thoroughly American art of over exaggeration.  I was sorely aggrieved but read from Anne Isaac's marvelous, \\"Swamp Angel\\" and felt much better in the end.  Since that time, I have come to the conclusion that it is the duty of every good honest citizen of our fair Etas Unis that writes for children to make at least one tall taleish picture book in their lifetime.  So far, there are plenty of writer/illustrators out there shirking their duties, but Deborah Hopkinson and Nancy Carpenter are not among them.  Between the two of them they've concocted a rip-roaring, snorting, fit to be tied narrative based on true events and spun into utter silliness and fantasy.  The result is the fun freewheeling, \\"Apples To Oregon\\", and after reading it your tots may well want to make the trip themselves.<br /><br />Delicious and her daddy are two of a kind.  They both love their beautiful Iowan fruit orchard.  And they'd give everything they have to preserve and protect those awesomely tasty trees.  So when Delicious's daddy decides that the family should pull up stakes and head for Oregon, it's only natural that the trees should come along with.  Trouble is, it's hard enough to get a family the size of Delicious's across the plains (there are eight or so children), let alone finicky fruit bearers.  But her daddy's determined, so off go Delicious, her mother, father, and seven siblings to make it to Oregon.  Along the way they ford a mighty river using only their feet, battle a mighty windstorm, are saved of thirst by finding water filled boots, and finally engage in combat with the sneaky low down Jack Frost himself.  By the end, Oregon has its trees and Delicious has a new home to settle in.<br /><br />Hopkinson writes in an easygoing drawl that doesn't try too hard or rely on an abundance of silly cliches.  And the various adventures visited upon the clan are silly but never too frightening or woeful.  The fact that Delicious's father seems to care more for his trees than his children is a bit off-putting.  And I can definitely see various children reading this story and getting ticked at his callousness.  But if you take it for what it's worth, the rest of the reading is easy going.  Hopkinson even includes in her Author's Note some information on the man this tale was loosely based on.  It may certain interest adults to know that as a result of 1847's Henderson Luelling, Oregon remains one of the finest fruit producers in the continental United States.<br /><br />As for illustrator Nancy Carpenter, she's given the pictures here a nice feel.  You jump in sympathy as you see the poor kids leap through the sand without their boots (and you can't help but curse their lazy father who is not only booted but riding a horse... some Pop he is!).  You cringe as Jack Frost's hand reaches to get past clever Delicious, ever watchful at her post.  The pictures here are a sweet compliment to a nice story.<br /><br />I don't know if I can say that this is the best tall tale book out there.  But it is nice to see how the hero in this particular case is an entire family and not just one single striking individual.  As I've noted, I've some problems with Delicious's father's misplaced loyalties, but otherwise this is a nice enough book and should make a fun storytime of its own.

The year 2004 can now officially be declared the \\"Best Year of Wordless Picture Books\\" on record.  This little appreciated genre of fiction has rarely ever been given its due.  Yet now we can enjoy such marvelous stories as \\"The Boy, the Bear, the Baron, the Bard\\" by Gregory Rogers and \\"Home\\" by Jeannie Baker.  And then, to top it all off, is the frosting on the cake.  \\"The Red Book\\" by Barbara Lehman, which stretches the boundaries of picture books everywhere and spices up its story with a distinctly post-modern edge.  Some author/illustrators might find it exceedingly difficult to write a picture book, within a book, within a book, without adding so much as a gasp or sigh to dot the text.  Not Lehman.  The result is this marvelous Caldecott Honor winner that deserves your full undivided attention.<br /><br />The story is a misleadingly simple one.  A girl walking through a gray winter cityscape finds the corner of a bright red book peeking out of a snowbank by the sidewalk.  She rescues the item and takes it with him to school.  A quick perusal of it shows that it is a story about a warm sunny island, where a boy walking along the sand also finds a red book, this time peeking out of a sandbank.  As the boy on the beach reads it he sees that is a story about a city... in which a girl in her classroom is reading about him.  The two kids realize what is happening and are intrigued.  So what is the natural solution to this problem?  The city girl leaves school for the day and buys as many colorful balloons as she can from a local street vendor.  The balloons carry her up... up... up above the industrial uniformity below, causing her to accidentally drop the book.  It lands on a sidewalk where we see the island boy sitting on the sand waiting.  As the wind flips the pages of the book the island boy sees the city girl coming in for a landing and they joyfully meet up with one another.  Then the red book closes and someone else picks it up and rides away on his bicycle.  Undoubtedly to participate in a whole new adventure.<br /><br />Did you get all that?  It's a little difficult to summarize this tale if only because Lehman, as an author/illustrator, is so doggone adept.  And though it sounds complex, I assure you that almost every five-year-old you show it to will grasp the concept immediately.  This is the kind of story that teaches them all about breaking down the fourth wall... in a preschool kinda way.  Entirely aside from the concept, however, are Lehman's great pictures.  It's funny, but until now Lehman hasn't illustrated or written anything particularly well-known.  Her style is like that of a sophisticated Amy Schwartz (of \\"What James Likes Best\\" fame), with simple characters and distinct lines.  But where Schwartz relies on simplicity to the point of wide open spaces, Lehman has filled this particular book with beautiful geometric lines and angles.  The city girl's classroom is all angles and kids in straight rows.  And she's especially good at distance and characters' points of view.  For example, when the city girl floats above his shrinking metropolis and drops the red book you have a beautiful view through her eyes of the book falling to the street, far below her little blue boots.  Then there are the colors.  In the city, everything has that dull uniformity of a wintery city.  On the island everything is bright and sunshiny (making for a lovely contrast when the boys see one another through the book).  Finally, the city girl's method of travel, her balloons, are bright beautiful multicolored orbs that are just as noticeable in the urban sky as they are the island.<br /><br />For a logical pairing to this story, consider reading \\"The Red Book\\" alongside David Wiesner's, \\"The Three Pigs\\".  Both stories present deft original deconstructions of old picture book motifs in a style that kids everywhere will wonder at and enjoy.  Admittedly, after reading this book I am a little sad that \\"Kitten's First Full Moon\\" (which I loved... don't get me wrong) won the Caldecott in 2005.  But at least this story has gotten the full attention it so richly deserves.

To do this, I've been attempting to use a variety of already existing lists, so as to bulk up my cumulative kiddie lit knowledge.  One of these lists is the New York Public Library's \\"100 Favorite Children's Books\\".  This list includes everything from \\"Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry\\" to \\"Freaky Friday\\".  Now I had been doing quite well on these titles and was pleased with its choices right up until I came across the somewhat bizarre choice of \\"Little By Little\\" by Jean Little.  This is one of those authorial biographies that are meant to tell an inspirational story by highlighting an author's struggles and tribulations.  Now, this is not a badly told story by any means.  Jean Little is, admittedly, not one of the better known children's authors living today (though a quick Amazon search will show you that she certainly doesn't lack for titles), but her story is fairly interesting.  It's just that... well, I dunno.  Maybe kids reading this tale would all find it fully fascinating.  For my part, I was disappointed.  What we seem to have here is a nice enough story about an obscure person dealing with some physical and social trials who triumphs in the end.  It's nice, but the book does not strike me as being a particularly memorable experience.<br /><br />Jean Little was originally born in Taiwan to a pair of overseas Canadians.  And from the moment she was born there was a great deal of concern over her eyes and her eyesight.  Jean popped out of the womb with scars on her corneas, a condition which left her cross-eyed and untreatable.  Glasses, for all that she wore them, did nothing to correct the problem.  After moving to Canada just after the outbreak of WWII, Jean faced constant ridicule and torment from her peers due to her partly blind condition.  A brief period spent in a school for children like herself did her a lot of good, but soon it was right back into public school where the cruelty of children was concentrated on poor little Jean.  Fortunately, she had her books and poetry to keep her happy.  Over time, Jean started to write her own stories and poems, some getting accepted into magazines and publications.  Her parents, always supportive, helped her to improve her skills and in spite of her handicap she managed to attend and graduate from college with a B.A.  The rest, as they say, is history.<br /><br />When I first began to read this story, I was struck by how similar Jean's story has been to the \\"100 Favorite Children's Books\\" biography, \\"Homesick: My Own Story\\" by fellow (better known) children's writer Jean Fritz.  Both women began life in East Asian countries and had to move to North America while young.  But while Fritz concentrates her attention on that particular transition and what it means to have two different homes, Little is more concerned with the tale of her own inspirational story.  Also, Little's book isn't filled with interesting illustrations (like Fritz's) so it's a wordy affair.  The occasional photograph does dot the text here and there, but that's all that breaks up the story.  I was a bit shocked at the abruptness of the ending as well.  Not to give anything away, but it shows Little receiving notice that her first children's book is going to be published.  Suddenly the story ends, without the book summing up what Little's been through or explaining how she changed over the years.  It was an odd way to end a story where the reader has been through so much with the protagonist.<br /><br />To be honest, the book struck me as odd.  It's a biography, but Little freely admits that no human being is capable of remembering perfectly every moment and conversation of their life.  So there's been some tampering to make the tale readable.  It's well-written.  It has an interesting tale of individual struggle.  And quite frankly I really didn't enjoy it.  I can't pinpoint why either.  Maybe it's the title.  Maybe the fact that I found it hard to identify with Jean from time to time.

302255:US	49148452	R13M7AAZ743PAF	0689816723	661301876	The Agony of Alice (Alice Books)	Books	4	46	48	N	N	Go ask Alice	When Phyllis Reynolds Naylor came out number one on the 2004 list of \\"Most Banned\\" books in America due to her \\"Alice\\" series, she probably didn't see it as a good thing.  But an unintended result of that dubious honor is the publicity that came with it.  As a children's librarian, I was (until the list was published) in the dark about Naylor's \\"Alice\\" books and hadn't so much as perused one before.  So I decided to begin at the very beginning with \\"The Agony of Alice\\" to see where it might take me.  After all, why is it that these books incite such fear and lamenting by ban-crazy parents nationwide?  I've got two little words for you:  Breasts and blood.  Yep, this is a book about a girl crossing over from ignorant fifth-grade to cool collected know-it-all sixth grade.  From tweenship into teenship.  And so on.  And if you fear for your children's pure little lily-white minds should they ever hear the word \\"period\\" or \\"bra\\" enter into a book's conversation, then \\"The Agony of Alice\\" is not for you.  But for those kids who not only identify with Alice but take after her, the series is a godsend.<br /><br />Growing up in a male-dominated household (one father, one brother) isn't all it's cracked up to be.  Sure, you don't have to worry about table manners but sometimes it's nice to have someone to ask about bras and shopping for jeans, and that kind of stuff.  And what Alice wants most in the world at this moment is a mother.  Her own died when she was four and ever since then she's been on the lookout for a replacement.  She thinks she's found one too, when she sees beautiful Miss Cooper, the sixth grade teacher, on her first day at a new school.  Unfortunately, Miss Cooper isn't Alice's teacher.  Instead, she's stuck with dumpy old Mrs. Plotkin.  Alice would do anything to switch classes, but as the year goes on she begins to learn that there may be more to Mrs. Plotkin than meets the eye... and less to Miss Cooper.<br /><br />The book hits the pre-adolescent girl mindset perfectly.  Alice, at first, lives in a state of perpetual and constant embarrassment.  She's embarrassed about things she did when she was in Kindergarten.  She's embarrassed about accidentally walking in on a guy in a changing room.  She's embarrassed when she wears shirt slathered in perfume and when she accidentally kicks Miss Cooper in the arm.  But while she never stops doing potentially damaging things, she does come to the conclusion that, \\"I wondered... if people went on doing stupid things even after they reached twenty.  Yep, I decided.  They just didn't worry about them so much, that's all\\".  And while it is clear that Alice hasn't reach some kind of a plateau of tween understanding, she at least sorts a couple issues out here and there.<br /><br />In the end, it's a fun book that serves a useful purpose.  Though it was originally published in 1985 and contains some downright dated elements (her brother goes out with a girl with pink glasses frames and people walk around wearing jeans that read \\"Hang Ten\\" on them) the book has remained popular with the young `uns.  That's quite an accomplishment.  So if you're sitting at home one night and the urge strikes you to read a banned book, this might not be a bad selection.  It has just the right elements of humor and self-knowledge to make the reading enjoyable.  A nice title.tly.  Alice, at first, lives in a state of perpetual and constant embarrassment.

That old familiar cynicism that comes when I see a virtually unknown book win a prestigious award.  In this particular case I'm referring to \\"Coming On Home Soon\\" by Jacqueline Woodson.  A touching intimate portrait of a girl suffering a separation from her parent, the book won the enviable Caldecott Honor.  So does it deserve it?  Which is to say, does it deserve to be remembered, in some part, for decades to come? Well, let's just say that my cynical first viewing of the story revealed this to be a surprisingly sensitive picture book.  This is one of those perfect meldings of picture and language.  A truly touching and lovely work to enjoy.<br /><br />In the midst of World War II, black women have an unprecedented chance to work various jobs up North in Chicago while the men are away fighting.  So Ada Ruth's mama is off to take a chance.  She's leaving her daughter with Grandma and will be back when she's made enough money for the three of them.  This is hard on her little daughter but she writes regularly to her mother and hopes for the best.  She even finds a kitten to adopt, though Grandma keeps telling her not to get too attached to it.  Through the rain, then the snow, as the months pass and time goes by Ada Ruth keeps track of the time and is finally rewarded, one day, with a most precious letter.<br /><br />It's odd for me to write out the plot of the story.  Having read through it, I was under the distinct impression that it was a deeply involved story.  And to some extent, it is.  But it's not easy to summarize.  Maybe that's because Woodson's prose is so deft and practical.  She peppers the story with emotional moments and unconscious details of what it was like to live in the past.  There are gutsy choices in the text as well.  In one two-page spread we see Ada Ruth lying on her side with her kitten and just two little words, \\"Time passes\\".  There's a sentimentality here that never becomes cloying or too cute.  This is an author who has figured out how to be touching without striking a single dishonest chord.  If you find yourself unaccountably moved by the end, it really shouldn't strike you as peculiar, considering the Woodson's talent.<br /><br />And of course there are the illustrations of E.B.... (no, not the \\"Charlotte's Web\\" author) to contend with.  This entire story could be defined simply through White's use of light.  When mama is preparing to leave, it's raining outside, giving the scene a damp chill glow.  When Ada and grandma are walking outside in the snow, the overcast sky dapples everything a uniform gray.  And when Ada sits at her little table with a comforting cup of hot cocoa and two biscuits before her, the sunlight through the window is bright and cheery.  But my favorite image in the book is the last.  Though we never see the tearful reunion between mama and her relatives, the last picture shows her approaching the run down but sturdy home in the snow.  There's something about the house and the setting and the small figure of mama that I am certain will be deeply burned into many a youngster's brain for years and years to come.  It's the happy ending they'll all want, but within a shockingly realistic setting.<br /><br />So a big round of applause to the Caldecott committee for selecting this lovely little winner.  If you're looking for a picture book of historical fiction, I can think of no better tale than the winning, \\"Coming On Home Soon\\".  As enjoyable to read as it is stunning to page through.

304241:US	49148452	R3GTVUG9Y7CCZ6	0618439293	893819957	Lizzie Bright and the Buckminster Boy (Newbery Honor Book)	Books	5	39	43	N	N	The price of learning what the whales already know	Having finally finished, \\"Lizzie Bright and the Buckminster Boy\\", I see now that the 2005 Newbery year was one filled with books for older child readers.  Whether those readers are into racism or autism, the subject matter of the winners was particularly complex and mature.  And in none of these winners is the subject more mature than in \\"Lizzie Bright\\".  Basing this tale on the true events that occurred on Malaga Island, just off the coast of Maine, the story is a thoughtful look at the meaning of racism, friendship, human connection, and loss.  It's not going to strike the kids who read it as a cheery devil-may-care book.  But its magnificent writing keeps it from becoming another \\"Kira-kira\\" sob-fest.  In any case, it's the kind of story that'll give you reason enough to stop, think, and consider.<br /><br />According to Turner Buckminster's calculations, he was in his new home of Phippsburg, Maine for approximately fifteen minutes shy of six hours when he realized that, \\"he didn't know how much longer he could stand it\\".  For one thing, he's the son of the town's new minister.  And when you're the minister's son you're expected to be the soul of virtue.  Turner's not a bad kid, but he has a heck of a way of getting into trouble.  It's only when he escapes to the seacoast and meets Lizzie Bright Griffin that things start to look up.  Lizzie's one of the black people living on the tiny island of Malaga, just off the coast of Phippsburg.  It's a poor community (this is 1912, after all), but they get by.  Unfortunately, the town's been losing money and it seems the Buckminsters have been hired by the city's fathers to help them in their goal of ridding Malaga of its inhabitants so as to set it up as a tourism site.  That means throwing Lizzie and all her neighbors off the only home they've ever known.  As Turner comes to terms with what it means to shrug off the scandalized eyes of the townspeople, as well as his parents' disapproval, he learns that for all the sorrows life may hand you, there can sometimes be salvation in the blink of a whale's mysterious eye.<br /><br />Now there's some pretty heavy-handed subject matter going on here.  You have perfectly nice little old ladies and young lively black kids being carted off to insane asylums (1912 insane asylums at that).  You have several major characters die, usually off-camera, without so much as a howdy-doo.  You have evil presented as godliness (topical considering the times in which we live), and the good of the almighty dollar aligned with God's supposed will.  And that's not even touching on the racism issues, the human rights issues, and the rights children have in the eyes of the law.  This is a book about bullies and how one stands up to them.  I think what I really loved about \\"Lizzie Bright\\" was that Schmidt never took the easy road out.  There aren't any miracles here or unexpected changes of heart (save one, but it's believable).  People in this book are a set of contradictions, but for all that they do bad things they may not always be bad people per say.  Bad things happen to good people, and they happen a lot.  If you don't want your kids to know this, then you may as well grab the nearest Dick and Jane compendium and pretend that history never happened.  But if you want to give them a well-informed, sometimes dark, but always interesting novel to peruse, this is it.<br /><br />Now I did have some qualms here and there.  There's nothing I hate more than an author/filmmaker/playwright/etc. who relies on that old \\"magical-black-friend\\" motif.  You know the one I'm talking about.  You'll find it in any story where an uptight white person meets someone of a different race and suddenly gets in touch with the earth/their feelings/what's really important/and so on.  And there is a bit of that here.  There's also the fact that there's rarely a black person in this book who comes off as anything but saintly.  I like my characters to have a little depth to them.  A little good and bad.  But here the blacks sort of fall under the \\"victim\\" banner and never leave it.  I wish they had as much complexity as, say, Turner's preacher father, but there doesn't seem to be much chance of that.  Still, Lizzie's okay.  She's kind of a likable version of that gawdawful \\"Ida B\\" (another children's book that came out in 2004 and that you should avoid at all costs).  Lizzie gets mad at inappropriate times and she's never as nice to Turner as she should be, so when I say that the African-Americans in this tale never show enough depth, I'm excluding the title character.  Lizzie's a fascinating character, and one that you wish you saw more of.<br /><br />This is a book to spark some highly hepped up debates.  You may well find yourself shaking with anger on one page and sighing with infinite relief on the next.  Schmidt really defines himself here as one of the finest children's authors living today.  When you read the line of a character who asks, \\"So, Turner Buckminster III, when you look through the number at the end of your name, does it seem like you're looking through prison bars?\\", you cannot help but smile.  Perhaps this book will not be remembered as Schmidt's best, though.  I have a feeling that as an author he'll have a lot more to say to the children of the world.

304747:US	49148452	R1VWK9BEQYE6WX	0590341251	587017410	Clifford the Big Red Dog	Books	3	30	35	N	N	An ode to the original Clifford	I've never had much luck reviewing distinctly simple picture books like \\"Clifford\\".  In the past, my observations of such books as the \\"Spot\\" series have been universally loathed by those parents who like their picture books sweet, simple, and relatively bereft of complexity.  And \\"Clifford\\", sad to say, sort of falls into that category.  But I hadn't read the books in years, and with the overwhelming popularity of the \\"Clifford\\" television series, I thought I'd give that big ole lovable red-tinged dog another go.  So I went to the library, found myself a copy, and settled down.  The book was pretty much as I remembered it.  Simple words that kids can understand.  Funny situations that a big dog can get into (chasing cats = chasing lions when your dog is big enough).  All in all, I was a little surprised by how much I enjoyed the book.  \\"There you go\\", I told myself.  \\"You've been pooh-poohing this nice book all for naught\\".  But you know what I really loved about \\"Clifford\\"?  The killer illustrations circa 1963.  They were great.  The edition of the book I read was republished in 1985 and had all the classic elements of the genre.  You meet Emily Elizabeth as she scoots up on a wicked soap box scooter.  And those black and yellow striped socks of hers?  Awesome!  I also enjoyed how hangdogish Clifford sometimes looked.  When Emily Elizabeth feeds him a cartload of cupcakes and tea, I loved his wide mouth and oddly disturbed expression.  Yep.  Sometimes the classic pictures are the best.<br /><br />So I went to Amazon.com to write my I-liked-it-but-there-are-still-much-better-picture-books review.  While determining which version to comment on (my copy was paperback but the only choices were board book or hardcover) I thought it might be wise to just make sure that the object I'd be reviewing looked the same as the current reissue.  I mean, I wasn't worried particularly.  Why would they change the original \\"Clifford\\"?  Well I was in for a bit of a nasty shock.  Thanks to Amazon.com's \\"Search inside the book option\\" I saw for myself how the mighty are fallen.  They haven't just updated Clifford.  They've radically redesigned him.  No longer does Emily Elizabeth break out the classic shoddily built boxcar scooter.  Now she's a pink wearing cardigan girl with remarkably boring white socks.  Those kids who stared up at Clifford in horror?  They're now grown-ups with better looking dogs.  And Clifford?  Well, let's just say he's completely lost his sometimes-mournful doggy expressions.  This is a new streamlined Clifford for a new Millennium.  I also doubt the \\"bad boys\\" referred to in the text look like the crew-cut poindexters I enjoyed so much in the original.<br /><br />Now I know why this happened, of course.  Times change.  I mean, there wasn't a single minority to be found in the original edition.  Now we have multi-ethnic couples looking up at Clifford with profound fear and distress.  And that's not a problem.  The problem I have is with the other updates.  What was wrong with Emily Elizabeth's ever changing but always colorful array of socks?  One minute they're green and black and the next they're pink and black.  What was wrong with her soapbox derby or those oddly clean cut bullies?  Ah well.  The sad thing is that these recent changes, undoubtedly done for Clifford's 40th anniversary, took away a lot of the things that made the original book so much fun.<br /><br />Not that your kids will care.  They will still love Clifford as much as they ever had.  They'll adore the idea of having their own house-sized mongrel to climb on and play with.  And the fact that he's red is just an added bonus.  It's a sweet book, yes.  And it has a nice title character.  But if you want my private opinion, the original's the best.  It will not look 100% like the Clifford your kids see on t.v., but neither (for that matter) do a lot of the early \\"Arthur\\" books.  There are better picture books for kids out there, but if you have picky children who only want to read books that have some sort of a connection to television, then you're not doing too badly with good ole \\"Clifford\\".  The biggest, reddiest, doggiest pup there be.picky children who only want to read books that have some sort of a connection to television, then you're not doing too badly with good ole \\"Clifford\\".

Heck, you can't throw a dart in a crowded library without hitting five or six children's books all dedicated to those fishy sea ladies.  But what about selkie women?  When do they get their due?  Few books about selkies actually make them out to be women, as it happens. The men get, \\"A Stranger Came Ashore\\" and \\"Island of the Aunts\\", for example.  Female selkies appear in \\"Daughter of the Sea\\", but not much else.  So it was with great joy that I located not only a selkie book starring a woman, but a picture book at that.  \\"The Selkie Girl\\" is your classic tale of abduction, male dominance, and naked women.  Everything a picture book could aspire to.  It is written by children's literature demi-god Susan Cooper (known best for her \\"The Dark Is Rising\\" stories), and illustrated by fellow Brit Warwick Hutton.  It is a lovely little work.<br /><br />Donallan lives alone by the sea with his cat and his dog and his sheep.  It's a lonely life and Donallan longs for some company.  One day, while scrounging for seaweed, he is enchanted by the song of three lovely naked women singing on a nearby rock.  When he tries to investigate, however, they dive into the waves and become seals or selkies.  An elderly man living near Donallan tells the young man how to catch one of the women as his bride.  He must come on the same day one year from now and before the woman can grab it, steal her seal skin.  Then she'll be bound to follow Donallan home.  He does, she does, and they have five kids.  Until, one day, their youngest son catches his father removing a lovely long sealskin from a mysterious brick behind their house...<br /><br />Cooper, quite frankly, should do more picture books.  This particular one contains all her lovely turns of phrase and particular lilts.  Says the first sentence in the book, \\"The island rise green out of the sea, where the waves foam over the grey rocks, and strange things may happen there\\".  The fact that Cooper has remained faithful to the whole naked chick part of the tale is also impressive.  Other authors might have shied away or said the ladies were wearing seaweed garments or some such thing.  The tale is a classic one, one told for centuries and not to be tampered with.  So yes, this is a book about a man basically forcing someone to be his wife.  Therefore, when she escapes back to the sea at the end, you're not particularly sad about it.  Some kids reading the book may be a bit perturbed, but picture books should engage children as much as possible.<br /><br />It is a bit of a pity that Warwick Hutton's illustrations don't convey the mystery of the story particularly well.  His watercolors are lovely and majestic, but not particularly detailed.  I cannot help but think that the book's editor could have located a more appropriate illustrator somewhere.  Ah well.  In the end it's the story that matters, and this one is truly lovely.  Barbaric, perhaps.  But lovely.

308225:US	49148452	R2T7H2Z7YKVQWV	0439455839	781223522	All Aboard!: A True Train Story	Books	3	4	8	N	N	Can't you hear the whistle blowing?	Kids constantly and without cease, amaze.  For example, you enter into the profession of Children's Librarianship with a set of preconceived notions.  At least, I did.  I assumed that kids, little kids, would be interested in the following topics:  Fairy tales, dinosaurs, trucks, firemen, and various animals of a pet-like nature.  What didn't I count on?  The lure of trains.  Children adore trains.  They like to learn about what makes a train run.  They like to see where it goes and what kinds of sounds it makes.  Why on earth is this?  I would've thought that in this topsy-turvy world of high tech electronics and sleek modes of transportation the world of trains would have been abandoned and forgotten.  Not so much.  And as a result, various picture books have capitalized on this locomotive goldmine.  Some of these are delicious inventive affairs, like Margaret Wise Brown's, \\"Two Little Trains\\" (be sure you get the version illustrated by Leo and Diane Dillon).  And then there are others like \\"All Aboard!\\".  A perfectly harmless book that shows photographs of trains with some vague sound effects and, as a result, captures the hearts of youngsters everywhere.  It's a fine book.  Just not as great as some of the other train tales out there.<br /><br />Photographing one of the five Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge steam engines still in working condition today, the book views the train as it navigates its way along the Colorado Rocky Mountains in the summertime.  The book begins with, \\"All aboard!  Turn the page and step back to a time when narrow gauge steam engines clickety-clacked along the historic San Juan wilderness\\".  And clickety-clack they do.  This isn't really a book that supposes that what you see in the pictures could have taken place decades ago, of course.  The passenger holding the digital camera says as much.  But with a loud whoo-whoo the machine is off and chugging.  We get a lot of two word descriptive sentences after that point.  Things like \\"Lights blinking\\" and \\"More steam\\".  The text is fine and all, but it never gets a momentum going.  You find yourself wishing that it would slowly increase like a train, hit its peak, then slow down at the end.  It never does.  Instead, it just comes to a normal close without much hooplah.<br /><br />But what the book lacks in inventiveness it almost makes up for in its afterword.  At the end of the tale the reader is given factual information about the classic Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge locomotives.  There's a section on the tracks, and another on the whistles.  There's even a webpage for the trains themselves (which, frankly, were a bit more enticing than the book).

The enemy of man's best friend.  The fearsome entity that dooms good puppies to a life in the pound or (worse) that great big boneyard in the sky.  You will never see dog overpopulation in a book (unless that book follows the \\"Millions of Cats\\" model) due to this vengeful scourge.  Just the same, what a poorer place the world would be without them.  Take, for example, the charming 2001 Caldecott Honor book, \\"The Stray Dog\\" by Marc Simont.  Written and illustrated by a man who once won a Caldecott Medal in (and I am not making this up) 1957, the book is a sweet and true story of how a family and a dog come together at last.  It's a simple tale with a predictable ending, but somehow you just can't get enough of it.  A book deserving of the moniker \\"sweet\\".<br /><br />This is the part of the review where I sum up the plot of the aforementioned book.  Even the most basic picture book usually yields me a good paragraph of writing here.  With \\"The Stray Dog\\" however, there's not much to say.  A family goes to the park and finds a stray dog to play with.  They don't take him home, believing him to already belong to someone else.  When they come back to the park the next week they wait attentively for their friend and sure enough here he comes (albeit chased by a particularly brutish dogcatcher).  The children give chase, use their belt and hair ribbons as a leash and collar to convince the catcher that the dog is theirs, and bring him home at last.  It's very cute and based on a story told back in 1983 by one Reiko Sassa, who gets full credit for this amazing tale.<br /><br />Simont's illustrations have truly grown and changed over the years, it's true.  \\"A Tree Is Nice\\" is a very simple, rather boring picture book.  Lovely but verging on dull.  The pictures in \\"The Stray Dog\\", on the other hand, are snappy.  They have pep and verve and a whole lotta moxie.  Of course, the story is oddly situated in time.  When you see fellow dog walkers in the park, the time appears to be contemporary.  But then you notice how 1950ish the main characters are.  Mom dutifully does the cooking in apron and heels (at home... she's in slacks and sneakers in the park).  Pop drives the car and has his coffee black.  Sis wears a ponytail and brother plays baseball.  So you've a bit of nostalgia going on here.  Nothing particularly offensive.  Just a touch of a throwback.<br /><br />But the book's great all in all.  There's a great sequence of the distracted family thinking about the little dog they left behind.  Each one of them forgetting or ignoring something particularly important.  And the final shot of various people and their different dogs is worth the price of admission alone.  \\"The Stray Dog\\" won't win any awards for breaking new ground or even challenging young minds.  But it reads well, it looks good, and it fills a need.  A choice selection for anyone interested in dog/pet books.  Consider pairing it with Bob Graham's far more up-to-date, \\"Let's Get a Pup, Said Kate\\".the story is oddly situated in time.

Johnson to sit up in his bed one day and decide that NOW was the time to create a cubism styled picture book about an event in the life of Henry David Thoreau .... starring a bear?  And while you're answering that question I'd also like to know just exactly where I myself can get such brilliant insights?  Because when it comes right down to it, Thoreau's life adapts to children's book/bear/Cubism mold rather perfectly.  It may be a somewhat bizarre concept, but there's no knocking the results.  In the end, we are left with \\"Henry Hikes to Fitchburg\\", one of the first of Johnson's \\"Henry\\" series, and a book without an easy comparison.  As fellow children's author Daniel Pinkwater said of the book, \\"Buy an extra copy and store it for the next generation\\".<br /><br />The book is told almost as a parable, starring Henry and his friend.  One day, the two decided to go to Fitchburg to see what there was to see.  Henry decided to walk, believing it to be the fastest way.  The friend decided to do some honest work, earn money, buy a ticket, and travel by train.  This was, to him, the fastest way.  So off Henry walked and his friend worked.  The book then carefully parallels their separate, yet connected experiences.  As Henry finds a bird's nest, complete with eggs, his friend cleans out a chicken coop.  As Henry plucks ferns and flowers to press in a book, his friend pulls weeds from a garden.  You get the idea.  By the end the friend has worked himself to the bone, taken a hot crowded train to Fitchberg, and just barely beats Henry.  But as Henry himself notes, this may in part be due to the fact that he stopped for blackberries earlier in the day.<br /><br />Once you become accustomed to the uncommon nature of the illustrations, their peculiar beauty really begins to sink in.  This is Cubism lite.  It's filled with stunning colors and neat tight angles.  Johnson also creates delicate details that take a second or third reading to notice.  For example, the fact that Henry's activities mirror his friend's isn't apparent at first.  Also, some actions lead to later reactions.  On one two-page spread, Henry places his paw in a tree for its honey.  The next shot of him says, \\"Henry jumped into a pond\\", not mentioning that in the picture an angry swarm of bees is pursuing him there.  The text is just as urbane.  A kid isn't going to understand why the grown-up reading them the story keeps chuckling at the names of the people Henry's friend does odd jobs for (Mr. Emerson, Mrs. Alcott, Mr. Hawthorne, etc.).  Some adults might not understand either, for that matter.  Finally, there's a helpful note accompanying the book at the end that explains a little about Mr. Thoreau himself and quotes the Walden passage that is reenacted in this book.<br /><br />Sometimes you find the rare picture book that's just as beautiful to page through as it is fun to read.  \\"Henry Hikes to Fitchburg\\" falls into that category.  All sharp lines and bright lively colors, it's beautiful, smart, and worth its weight in gold.  A fine addition to your library, whether public or private.ond or third reading to notice.

Whether you're reading Emily McCully's charming, \\"Picnic\\", Anno's endlessly fascinating, \\"Anno's Journey\\", or even Jeannie Baker's knock-your-socks-off, \\"Home\\", the world of silent books for children is as variegated as it is fascinating.  And now we have the newest addition to the genre.  Author/illustrator Gregory Rogers has created a fine frolicksome foray into the world of Shakespearean plays, dancing bears, and the Tower of London itself.  \\"The Boy, the Bear, the Baron, the Bard\\" may not be ideal storytime fare for large groups of children, but in terms of one-on-one encounters it stands above the rest.<br /><br />A boy is playing soccer in London when his ball is knocked accidentally into a large abandoned theater.  Exploring further, the boy enjoys playing amongst the set pieces, trying on the costumes, and pretending to star in his own show.  But when a careless kick to the ball forces the boy to run between the curtains at exactly 4 o' clock (the time that all of Shakespeare's plays were performed) he suddenly finds himself 400 some years in the past with a full house staring back at him.  Incensed, a livid bard begins to chase the boy in revenge for destroying his play.  The kid escapes, and in his adventures of old Londontown he manages to free a chained bear, rescue a baron who's head is bound for the chopping block, and meet Elizabeth I herself.  It makes for a thrilling story of escape, friendship, and jolly good adventuring.<br /><br />First of all, I just want to say that I love the concept of Shakespeare being a villain of Terminatoresque proportions.  About the time the bard, who has presumably swam several miles out to meet Queen Elizabeth's barge, pulls himself out of the water and makes a lunge for the boy, that was the moment I really loved the book.  Is there anything more terrifying than an angry Shakespeare?  I think not.  Kids reading this book will get a great introduction into the world of Elizabethean drama and living.  From the Tower of London's ravens to the houses and shops that used to stand along London Bridge, the book is an excellent encapsulation of an earlier time.  You grow to love the bear and fear the bard.  Of the baron, there isn't much to say.<br /><br />So for a great wordless picture book that gives a brief history lesson amongst cartoon-like illustrations, this one can't be beat.  Consider it a fine addition for your own little budding Shakespeare scholar.to the world of Elizabethean drama and living.

You're bound to be amazed by the insight you receive when you find out that your dreamy peculiar friend loved \\"The Giving Tree\\" while your uptight straight-as-a-rod neighbor was a fan of \\"Mertle the Turtle\\".  I was once asking a friend of mine what book he best preferred when he mentioned \\"Arabel's Raven\\" by Joan Aiken.  I'd heard of Ms. Aiken before, of course.  The author of that magnificent \\"Wolves of Willoughby Chase\\", Aiken was the gothic queen of her day.  But a quick glance at the cover of \\"Arabel's Raven\\" shows she had a lighter sillier side as well.  Illustrated by an illustrator best known, perhaps, for his Roald Dahl books, Quentin Blake adds his distinctive style to this book about a girl and her perpetually voracious and curious raven.<br /><br />Mr. Jones, we are told right off the bat, was a respectable taxi driver.  And had he not been sideswiped by two maniacs on a motorcycle, he might never have noticed them hit a small black object that was attempting to cross the road.  On further inspection, Mr. Jones sees an unconscious and remarkably huge raven knocked out cold on the street.  Being a charitable soul, he brings the bird home to recuperate.  But what Mr. Jones doesn't count on is the raven's remarkable appetite once it wakes up and sees where it is.  Before you know it, it's pushing objects under the linoleum, eating the stairs (it has a real penchant for a good staircase), and knocking various objects to the ground.  Mr. Jones is stunned.  Mrs. Jones is aghast.  Arabel Jones, their daughter, is in love.  She swiftly names the bird Mortimer and adopts him on the spot.  Their adventures together in this book involve everything from catching jewel thieves to breaking into hospitals to rescuing fainting babysitters.  And you find as you read that the affection Mr. and Mrs. Jones come to have for Mortimer is the same affection you feel for him.  It makes for truly amusing and touching reading.<br /><br />There are lots of great books for kids that involve inviting a crazy n'er-do-well into one's home with disastrous results.  \\"The Cat In the Hat\\", \\"Pippi Longstocking\\", etc.  But these n'er-do-wells tend to be crazy because they're crazy people.  Mortimer, on the other hand, acts like a wild animal in a domestic environment.  Everything he does, aside from his eating habits, is understandable.  I can perfectly imagine a pet who decides to be pulled everywhere in a red wagon or insists on sleeping in a bread bin.  Mortimer's ability to eat anything and everything (at one point he devours an entire staircase leading from a subway train to its upstairs entrance) is just the kind of outrageous silliness to make the book exciting and full of what-will-Mortimer-do-next feelings.  And then there's also the fact that Mortimer, while being very much a raven with a raven mind-set and emotions, really does care deeply for Arabel.  When she becomes sick he goes to great lengths to reach her inside a closed up hospital.  And Quentin Blake's illustrations are hilarious.  I was particularly fond of the ones that showed Mortimer walking.  One foot stuck straight out in front of him and a cheeky smile on his face.<br /><br />The book is also full of jokes that parents will get while their children fail to understand.  As a raven, Mortimer's continual cries of \\"Nevermore\\" are always well placed in the narrative.  There are also truly Roald Dahl-like descriptive moments that are just as impressive in terms of their creativity as they are for their ridiculousness.  For example, in one section, Mortimer has become entranced with the idea of machines you can put coins into.  So off Arabel and her babysitter go to a newly renovated tube station with tons of machines.  Says the book of them, \\"Another has apples, pears, or bananas.  Another had sandwiches or meat pies.... Another would take a photograph of you looking as if you had seen a ghost.  Another would massage the soles of your feet.  Another would say a cheering poem and hold your hand while it did so... Another would blow your nose for you on a clean tissue, if you stuck the nose into a slot and, as well as that, give you a Vitamin C tablet and two mentholated throat lozenges, all for fivepence\\".  This is a book that is unafraid to make jokes and references that fly high high above the intended audience's head.  Parents everywhere should be grateful.<br /><br />Flaws?  Not many.  Unless you count the fact that in spite of the fact that this is a book that takes place in Britain, the odd word here and there has been Americanized.  I kept becoming confused when characters would eat \\"chips\\", because I was certain that in Britain chips are actually fries.  Yet the pictures show actual potato chips being consumed.  It makes for an odd reading.<br /><br />So if you've a child who loves their Roald Dahl but wants to try something a little different, \\"Arabel's Raven\\" is an obvious next step.  It's lighthearted and witty, with just enough mischief and good spirits to keep them interested and involved.  A fabulous story for young `uns.ther had sandwiches or meat pies....

The field tends to be dominated by such big names as Richard Peck and, in this case, Patricia Reilly Giff.  As a child I was always far more interested in books of fantasy and magic, and I am afraid that very little has changed since I have grown.  But \\"A House of Tailors\\" is one of those well-written works of historical fiction that can draw in even a fantasy-preferring twit like myself.  Giff brings to beautiful colorful life the world of 1870 Brooklyn, New York.  The dirt, the disease, and the small human pleasures of it all.<br /><br />Dina is desperately jealous of her older sister Katharina.  While Dina must stay in Germany doing what she hates most, sewing, Katharina is going to America to live with their rich Uncle.  At this moment in 1870 Germany is at war with France, an annoyance to Dina who likes to swap patterns with her friend Elise on the French side.  But when Dina escapes one morning to do her usual swap and is caught by German soldiers thinking her a spy, her escape can only be brought about one way.  She will have to be the one sent to America and not her sister.  Dina is embarrassed and distraught but the fact that she won't be sewing anymore is some comfort.  Yet when she arrives in America, the streets her uncle takes her down become dirtier and dirtier.  Finally they reach the last one, climb all the steps to the top floor, and enter the apartment.  That's when Dina sees the sewing machine in the middle of the room and realizes that she has simply exchanged one house of tailors for another.  Now she must save her money to return to Germany, but not before growing to love her family, the boy in the men's shop down the street, and this crazy mixed up town called Brooklyn where dreams of the future came sometimes come true.<br /><br />Giff's heroine undergoes a perfectly conceived series of changes and she grows and learns realistically in this new world of America.  At first, Dina is really quite awful.  When she runs off and does something without thinking you instinctively begin to cringe, knowing full well that some awful comeuppance is about to occur.  At the same time, however, she's intelligent and ingenious, not to say heroic.  It becomes clear that her true love is hatmaking and not sewing, and the sequences in which she describes the creation of a hat are truly amusing and wonderful.  They reminded me at times of the hatmaking in Diana Wynne Jones's, \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\".  Then there is the storytelling, something that Giff has perfected over the years.  This book is an almost perfect series of adventures and misadventures with a steady rising/falling action that retains interest right up until the end.  If you want something on the mid-19th century German immigrant experience, I can think of few books that tell their tales half as well as this one.<br /><br />Giff tells us in her Afterword that the Dina featured here is based on her own great-grandmother's life.  One hopes that Ms. Giff has more ancestors from whom to plunder this kind of rousing story.  Whether the book's showing the ways to battle smallpox or escape from tenement fires, it's a grand testament to a long gone time.

Well now we can return once again those halcyon days with Natalie Savage Carlson's Newbery Honor winning little book, \\"The Family Under the Bridge\\".  A simple remarkably upbeat little tale, it defines what it means to be a family while telling the tale of an adorable homeless man and his unwilling adoption by three fatherless children.  As storybooks go, this one has aged a bit poorly in light of its child abandonment and transient issues.  But it has a good heart and a fine little story.  I'm not going to put it on a pedestal or say that in 200 years it should be remembered as one of the top 100 children's books of the 20th century.  But it's cute and probably has legions of fans who remember it from their own youth.<br /><br />Hobos may come and hobos may go, but Armand of Paris isn't going anywhere.  He loves his beautiful French city with its history and ample bridges to sleep under.  With winter fast approaching, Armand's just on his way to put his ever moving home under his favorite bridge when he receives a nasty shock.  There, camped out under a thin blanket, are three red-haired children.  Armand doesn't trust children as a rule.  His greatest fear is that he'll grow to love them and then no longer be the freewheeling king of the road that he currently is.  These fears prove to be well founded when the kids adopt Armand as an unofficial grandfatherly figure and go with him all around and about the city.  Their dream is to someday have a home of their own, and with Armand's help and a little gumption, that dream starts to look a little more possible every day.<br /><br />The story's cute enough, with Armand as a roly-poly harmless figure leading the kids hither and thither throughout Paris.  There are some wonderful sequences with a traveling band of gypsies (who, remarkably, are exempt from that stereotypical magic-creature label they've acquired in hundreds of other children's books).  The gypsies are presented as regular folks, which I appreciated hugely.  Also, the book has a satisfying ending that all children hearing it will appreciate.  Carlson's narrative voice is affecting and Garth Williams's illustrations (you may best remember him as the illustrator of the \\"Little House\\" books as well as \\"The Cricket In Times Square\\") are striking.<br /><br />But then there are the problems that a book written in 1958 must face.  Now in this story, the mother character regularly abandons her children, without food, under a bridge in busy Paris.  She does this, rather than put them in a home where they could get (oh, I dunno) warm clothes and food, because of a fanatical instinct to keep the family together.  I can understand this on some level.  No one likes to be separated from their relations.  However, even after the mother makes the acquaintance of Armand (who she does not trust for a number of reasons), she still leaves her children with him all day.  She does not give them any food (they have to eat Armand's), or toys, or really anything to do but follow a fellow they don't even know around and about.  When he feeds them during the day by urging them to sing and then collecting money from strangers, she's incensed.  Better that her kids go hungry than (gasp, shudder) SING!  If the bad parenting going on in this story weren't enough, the idea that people are homeless simply because they are lazy is a bit worn as well.  Pretty much every tramp in this book is homeless because he or she wants to be.  Plenty get work at a drop of a hat, and at the end of the tale Armand goes from a fellow with zero job experience to the superintendent of a building.  And all because he's finally decided to get a job.  So when your kids walk down the street and see homeless people asking for food or money, you can bet they'll rest assured that those people are there because they're just too lazy to get hiredsomewhere.  What a lovely lesson to learn from a book.<br /><br />Ugh.  So there's that.  It's a nice tale, don't get me wrong.  But since I didn't grow up with it myself, I haven't a nostalgia for it that so many others do.  I can see its charms and I can see its flaws.  I prefer its charms, but I can't help but point out where it goes awry.  All in all, it's a fine little story and I don't mean to imply that by reading it your kids will suddenly become callous towards those in need.

When done well (as with Roberto Innocenti's, \\"Rose Blanche\\") it can be a heartfelt way of teaching children about horrific events.  When done poorly (as with Carmen Agra Deedy's magnificently insulting/patronizing, \\"The Yellow Star\\") it can turn you off of historical picture book fiction completely.  Now in the case of Karen Hesse's, \\"The Cats In Krasinski Square\\", the story is based on real events the author read in a short article.  After researching the event and meticulously making sure she would cite what she changed and what she didn't, Hesse wrote this one-of-a-kind book.  It tells the tale of a Jewish girl during WWII and the ways in which stray cats became heroes in their own right.<br /><br />A girl sits on a heap of rubble surrounded by cats.  It's Warsaw and the girl has escaped the Jewish ghetto to live hidden in plain sight with her sister.  So many Jews had to leave their homes and abandon their pets, that the cats have no one to love them anymore.  Says the girl, \\" `I have no food to spare'. The cats don't care\\".  She loves them and that's all that they need at this time.  Heading home again, the girl and her older sister are to participate in a plan to smuggle food to the people of the ghetto.  Yet before they do they're told that the supplies coming in on the next train are in danger.  Somehow the Gestapo have discovered the plan and are waiting with dogs at the station to sniff out the smugglers.  It's the little girl who comes up with a way to lead the dogs astray and give the smugglers the chance they'll need to escape.  And all thanks to a basketload of cats.<br /><br />As an author, Hesse is probably better known for her verse novels than her picture books.  But her ability to switch formats puts her at no disadvantage.  The words in this book are simple and laid out plainly for children to read on their own.  Though they say little, they convey the hope and resistance of a beaten-down people.  The girl is never named, perhaps because she never existed.  But much of this story is true, and the heroism involved is admirable.  A tip of the hat as well to illustrator Wendy Watson.  Through her subtle colors and shaded hues the story has the soft glow of the 1940s.  Light splays out over the cats and buildings beautifully.  Watson has obviously studied cat bodies and forms.  She knows exactly how to draw a kitty arching its back in the hope of getting stroked or lifting its hind foot to scratch a hard to get itch.  I loved the thick black lines that made up each and every scene, as well as the colors used.  This is a book of grays, browns, maroons, and soft custard yellows.  It's a pleasure to flip through again and again and again.<br /><br />So as WWII picture books go, I think that this one is my favorite.  It introduces the subject to children, giving an ample historical note at the back of the text for further reading but doesn't dwell on the darkest aspects of the time period.  This is just an excellent way to begin a conversation with a child about the 1940s.  It's lovely to look at and it contains adorable kitties.

321596:US	49148452	R3QQ2XY53ZFJB7	0064472558	63778849	Damage	Books	4	1	1	N	N	The silent killer of teenaged boys	Back in the 80's, a lot of teen novels were based on getting kids to NOT do stuff.  There were anti-drug books (like the notorious and simply awful \\"Go Ask Alice\\"), anti-drinking books, anti-driving too fast, anti-pregnancy, anti-being mean to your parents, etc.  So I think it was sometime during the 90s that perceptions and intentions slowly began to change.  Suddenly people were writing books about teens with problems that weren't their own faults.  Books where kids were abused at home, or suffered homelessness, or had ADD.  Which brings us to the 21st century and \\"Damage\\" by A.M. Jenkins.  By and large, the book's supposed to be about one thing and one thing only.  Depression.  And if this were some kind of an After-School-Special book then I'm sure the hero's depression would be the main focus of the story with peripheral attention paid to other characters and situations.  This, however, is not the case.  Jenkins is a little too good an author to allow her books to end up being one-sided diatribes.  As a result, \\"Damage\\", is a little too good to characterize as \\"just\\" a novel about depression.<br /><br />It didn't used to be this way.  When Austin began high school he was enthusiastic about everything.  Girls.  Football.  His friends.  But with the beginning of his Senior year, the year he's supposed to be having the time of his life, he just can't get excited anymore.  He still goes through the motions, of course.  And really, the only person who notices that anything is wrong is his best friend Curtis, so he can't be doing too badly, right?  Still, everything seems to be on a downhill track until Austin hooks up with gorgeous hot Heather.  She seems just the person to get him out of his rut.  Ignoring the warnings from Curtis, Austin goes for Heather full-throttle.  But he knows perfectly well that he should be careful.  One wrong step with her and he could end up feeling the way he did before.  Only much much worse and with possible irreparable results.<br /><br />There were a couple of things I particularly liked about this book.  I liked that it took place in a small town that wasn't stereotypical backwoodsy-everybody's-a-racist-hicksburg.  The result of making it such a close and loving community is that it shows that depression can hit a person anywhere.  Regardless of where they grow up or what their family situation is.  Of course, the book does have some flaws.  At times, it feels as if Jenkins is straining to make this book feel like a real teenaged boy's thoughts and fantasies.  While treading in the steps of such awesome YA writers like Chris Crutcher, Jenkins sometimes falls a little short when adopting a teen boy's voice.<br /><br />But it's still worth the read.  I suppose there's at least one worthwhile YA book for every topic of concern out there today.  And for depression, \\"Damage\\" may well be it.  But the book's just as much about football and dating as it is Austin's internal problems.  The author also includes important contact info for anyone who knows or is someone who needs professional help in treating this potentially deadly disease.  Jenkins lets readers suffering know that they're not alone.  Hopefully it can help someone somewhere.r />  <br />There were a couple of things I particularly liked about this book.

322860:US	49148452	R2SL0ATJQ33F9N	0689818831	199645811	Stella Louella's Runaway Book	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Runaway booky	You'd be surprised at the amount of library-related agonizing a child can go through when he or she is given the awesome responsibility of their first library card.  As a children's librarian I use a variety of picture books to draw on these fears and then put them safely to rest.  Books like \\"D.W.'s Library Card\\" and \\"Beverly Billingsly Borrows a Book\\" are invaluable for this purpose.  \\"Stella Louella's Runaway Book\\" is a bit different from these, but not by much.  Harping on the ability some children's books have of moving about seemingly of their own free will, the story follows Stella Louella's quest to track down her elusive book and return to the library before it is TOO LATE.<br /><br />In the first few pages we see a montage of Stella Louella reading her book everywhere.  In bed, on the floor, with breakfast, in the tub (oog), and so on.  But as we're told right off the bat, \\"On Saturday morning Stella's library book disappeared, as if in a magic act\\".  What ensues is a frantic search for the missing item, due that day at five o' clock.  Each person that Stella and her slowly growing capadres ask about the story, makes some kind of a comment on its plot.  As we meet more and more people, we slowly figure out that Stella's book was undoubtedly Goldilocks and the Three Bears.  Finally, after questioning the police, chair repair shops and even mattress dealers, Stella and company discover the book's final satisfying location.<br /><br />It's hard to dislike a book where the endpapers show all the characters we've met in the story triumphantly marching through the library, books to check out in hand.  The story's nice enough, though nothing special.  The idea that each person Stella asks has a personal connection to her story (for example, the police officer calls it a classic case of breaking and entering) is nice, but it gets strained.  I was a little surprised we didn't meet a bear trainer at some point.  But the cumulative frenzy builds nicely and the huge crowd at the end is a wonderful audience to hear about where the book at last meets its final destination.  As for the illustrations, they are sweet and serve their purpose well.<br /><br />To be honest, if it weren't for the fact that I'm a librarian and this book plays to my sympathies, I might easily give it only three stars.  But because it does encourage kids to go to the library, I give a fine healthy four.  Reading this book to your child will go particularly well if they're familiar enough with Goldilocks to understand the references to it without help.  As it is, it's a fun story with a cute twist.  A fine welcome-to-the-library-type-book.uge crowd at the end is a wonderful audience to hear about where the book at last meets its final destination.

When friends have a falling out, no one ends up happy.  This is the case whether the friends are four, fourteen, or forty.  There are roughly seven hundred million picture books about such break-ups too.  Some of these are good.  Most of these are not.  Now in the case of \\"Hot Day on Abbott Avenue\\", the book is excellent.  Well written.  Illustrated with something akin to aplomb.  And it's a story that kids can relate to.  Friends break-up every day.  How they get back together is the important lesson to be learned.<br /><br />It's hot.  Sticky, nasty, \\"too hot to even flutter a fan\\" hot.  And what happens when the temperature rises?  So do tempers too.  In the case of Kishi and Renee, we first meet them as they keep a careful distance from one another.  These former best friends who used to be so close have quarreled.  It seems the ice cream man came through and Kishi went and bought the last blue ice pop when she KNEW that it was Renee's favorite.  Kishi points out that it's her favorite too, but there's no agreeing between these two.  For them, this is a never-going-to-be-friends-again day.  Period.  It's only when they find themselves lured to a tempting double dutch game down the street and meet up with a restocked ice cream man that these two can put aside their differences and become best friends again.<br /><br />Now author Karen English has written a nice story.  It's not going to knock your socks off, and it's not quite as good as her amazing, \\"Speak To Me (And I Will Listen Between the Lines)\\" which also came out in 2004.  Still, it's a good story about healing rifts.  Javaka Steptoe is the wonder behind this book's visually entrancing format.  Using a combination of the most delicate cut papers alongside found-object collage, the story becomes an engrossing read simply because it's such a wonder to page through.  Renee and Kishi's neighbor Miss Johnson is decked out in pale transparent yellow slacks and a crinkly realistic pink crepe paper shirt that must've taken Steptoe days to get exactly right.  When Kishi aims a water hose straight up to jump through, the water is a string of pink curly streamers going haywire into the sky.  There's a real sense of movement and energy to these pictures.  Static paper never seemed so vibrant.<br /><br />Certainly this kind of illustration is not going to be to everybody's taste.  But for those who're interested, \\"Hot Day on Abbott Avenue\\" is a beautifully illustrated well-written romp.  A great tale with great characters that kids everywhere will understand and identify with.at must've taken Steptoe days to get exactly right.

First of all, the story's a classic lesson in rudeness.  Goldilocks is rude rude rude.  So why not go a step further?  Why not make her rude AND stinky?  Better yet, rude, stinky, AND mean to her mama?  And if you're going to do all that, you'd best be changing her name as well.  Goldilocks?  Heck no.  This child is now Dusty Locks.  Now place this entire story in the West, somewhere around Colorado maybe, and you've got yourself one heckuva story.  Author Susan Lowell and illustrator Randy Cecil have come together to tell a version of Goldilocks that surpasses the original.  You want to tell the story of the three bears but do it in a fun way that kids are sure to love?  \\"Dusty Locks\\" has your number.<br /><br />Now what kind of bears live out west?  Grizzly bears, that's who.  So three cowboy boot wearing, vest doffing, huge belt buckle sporting bears one day go for a walk.  While they do so, the nefarious Dusty Locks, outfitted in grass-stained overalls and oversized boots of her own, breaks into their home.  After all, \\"those grizzlies were fine, upstanding, law-abiding critters, honest as the day is long, and they never locked their door\\".  More fool they, for Dusty begins to meticulously tear apart their little home.  First she devours their beans.  I liked the detail that the great big grizzly bear liked his beans, \\"chock-full of chile peppers\\".  Then she pounds their chairs into smithereens.  Finally, she proceeds to find somewhere to sleep and rest her weary rotten little head.  The bears return, discover the destruction in full, and wake the stinky gal up.  After she flees home her mother loves her into an entirely new little girl and the bears never saw her again, \\"or if they did... they never recognized her\\".<br /><br />Much like fellow drawl-infused picture book, \\"Swamp Angel\\" by Anne Isaacs, this book is a pleasure to read aloud.  From the gruff big bear to the squeaky little bear to the southern ladylike mama bear, you can get a lot of mileage from this puppy.  Couple that with Randy Cecil's inventive illustrations and you've got yourself a magnificent storytime tale.  Cecil's pictures seem cartoony and none too inventive at first.  But then you start noticing little details here and there.  For example, why do the three bears have three chairs to sit on?  To play their instruments and sing at night, of course.  How does Dusty Locks stumble on their abode?  She (evil child that she is) chases a skunk there.  A skunk, I might add, that pops up more than once throughout this story.  So with funny pictures and a one-of-a-kind narrative voice this book's a surefire winner with any childlike crew.  Consider it recommended tenfold, and then some.to read aloud.

Once at an official gathering of hoity-toity children's authors and the cream of the librarian crop, Mr. Richard Peck was seated at the table of a young enthusiastic librarian of young adults.  Mr. Peck (whose curse in life is to be mistaken for fellow children's writer Robert Newton Peck everywhere he goes) was under the distinct impression that his books were read by reluctant readers everywhere.  The librarian (who knew exactly who Mr. Richard Peck was) took great pains to explain to the author that, in fact, reluctant readers tend to avoid titles like, \\"The River Between Us\\" and \\"Fair Weather\\".  Peck was astounded by that news.  After all, he was the author of the wonderful \\"A Long Was From Chicago\\" and \\"A Year Down Yonder\\".  Funny novels that take place in America's heartland and leave the audience wanting more.  But do kids really read these books?  Well, we're about to find out.  With \\"The Teacher's Funeral\\", Peck has returned to what he does best.  Tell amusing stories from a kid's perspective in what some might call a \\"simpler time\\".  Even if you can't stand the author's dour forays into historical fiction, you'll have to admit that titles like this one really show off Peck's funny side.<br /><br />As first sentences go, it's hard to beat this one: \\"If your teacher has to die, August isn't a bad time of year for it\\".  And we're off!  When Russell and Lloyd find out in August of 1904 that mean old Miss Myrt Arbuckle is pushing up the daisies and not about to start another year in their ramshackle old schoolhouse, they are nearly beside themselves with joy.  Surely the school board will be unable to find a proper substitute in time, right?  Surely that means that Russell can fulfill his dream of running away to the Dakotas to work on their gorgeous steel threshing machines, right?  Not so much.  Enter Tansy.  She's Lloyd and Russell's older sister who's been doling out their meals and whoppings ever since their mother died.  She's rough and tough and before you know it she's gotten herself hired as the new teacher.  Leaving, I might add, Russell and Lloyd in agony.  They are LIVING with their teacher now.  So Russell schemes to escape his fate, the students of the class learn far more than they'd expect, and not one but three suitors all start vying for Tansy's hand.  It's a year that turns out to be anything but dull.<br /><br />Peck's grasp of Indiana turn-of-the-century vernacular is unbeatable.  In \\"The Teacher's Funeral\\" he's really at the top of his form.  Adeptly, the author combines a couple mysteries here and there with humor, suspense, and a whole heaping helpful of historical facts.  Want to know what a 1904 racing car looked like?  Or where most Indiana residents got their toilet paper?  It's all here, baby.  In fact, the historical notes in this book are so slyly worked in that kids may often find themselves scratching their heads in confusion.  Russell mentions that if Tansy got married then she would have to quit teaching.  There isn't any debate about this or even a challenge to it.  And here I was, a 26-year-old reader, wondering why it was the case.  It took me an embarrasingly long time to remember that married women once did not work, under any circumstances.<br /><br />Will kids like this puppy, though?  I think so.  But only some.  Really, I suspect that \\"The Teacher's Funeral\\" is one of those books that would work best if it's read aloud to a class of kids, one chapter a day.  As for those kids that are assigned it, I doubt they'll hate it on the same level that they come to hate \\"Shabanu\\" or \\"Kira-Kira\\".  Still, this is pleasurable reading.  Not something that should be assigned.  In short, some kids will definitely enjoy the practical jokes and lovable characters that pop up in this puppy.  For others, it may strike them as a deadly dull affair.  But I liked it and I've little doubt that you'll like it too.  I represents a fine frolicksome novel that'll have a cadre of fans cheering for it as the years go by.  A winner.that'll have a cadre of fans cheering for it as the years go by.

And one of those rules stated that I was not to read other reviews of a book on the site until AFTER I'd written my own review.  I wanted my little writings to remain unsullied and pure, filled only with my own thoughts (which I obviously mistook to be brilliant) and feelings.  After a while though I gave up on this rule.  By and large (and this is not speaking for all reviews... just 90% of them) a review for a children's book goes something along the lines of \\"It was good, my four-year-old requests it every night, buy this book, etc.\\".  Nothing too shocking or revealing.  So I grew lazy.  I started reading other reviews of picture books long before I sat down to actually write a review of my own.  Just moments ago I went to do the same thing for the beautiful picture book, \\"Martin's Big Words\\".  This book was on my list of must-reads because it had garnered itself a Caldecott Honor years before.  So I went to the appropriate Amazon.com page (much as you are now) and read the first review on the list.  At the time, it was an unassuming July 18, 2002 review entitled, \\"There's Something Wrong Here...\\".  I read the review.  I digested the review.  And I came to the inescapable opinion that the points raised in the review were good ones.  Ones that I should consider, dare I say, in my OWN review.  This is unprecedented.  Never has a review for a book, a children's book, really hit home for me like this one did.  So to that mysterious reader who thought to make a point back in 2002, I commend you.  And to myself, a mental whipping for breaking my own rules.  It's a hard act to follow, but I've a point or two of my own to make and I'm gonna make `em.<br /><br />Now  as a children's librarian I get a whole heaping helpful of small children coming in around January 17th (or just before) requesting books on Martin Luther King Jr.  For the older children, such requests are usually easy enough to fulfill.  But for little ones with short attention spans and even shorter vocabularies, the choices are limited.  Fortunately, there's, \\"Martin's Big Words\\".  A beautiful encapsulation of the life of the great man, the book shows Martin as a child, first encountering the insanity of segregation.  We see him grow up and preach a gospel of love and acceptance.  Following this are small looks at the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott, civil rights marches, and his 1964 Nobel Peace Prize.  Finally, while marching with striking garbage collectors (a fact not often mentioned in children's biographies of King), he was shot and killed.  Says the book at the end, \\"His big words are alive for us today\\".<br /><br />The book is stunning to look at, you know.  The endpapers consist of pane after pane of brown, peach, amber, and umber stained glass.  Taken together, the stained glass appears to be a variety of different skin tones all working together to make something beautiful.  Using collage, illustrator Bryan Collier peppers his unique style with symbolic images (such as four lit candles placed in remembrance of the girls killed in the Sixteenth Street Baptist church).  In the rest of the book, Collier's images leap off the page.  They're bright, colorful and eclectic.  Combined with author Doreen Rappaport's elegant eloquent narrative, children get a full understanding of the courage and greatness behind Dr. King's life and actions.<br /><br />So what about the complaints of this book?  Let's examine them fully.  First of all, one criticism is that in the image of the civil rights march there are thirteen men on display, none of whom are either white or female.  This is true.  And it is a little odd.  Not don't-buy-this-book odd.  Just why-did-the-illustrator-make-that-choice odd.  From looking at the picture I can only assume that Collier was working off a snapshot of a portion of a march from the past and didn't notice that it was a bit skewed.  The other criticism of the book is that whites are only portrayed as evil rednecks that want to kill Dr. King.  I dunno.  The book says plenty of things about diversity and the coming together of the races.  As for the lack of positive white images, I admit they're not present in this particular book.  However, the world is filled to overflowing with books that DO present positive images of white people.  As a white person myself, I'm sick to death of 'em.  And I'd gladly exchange four or five hundred such books for a single one that was half as beautifully illustrated and written as \\"Martin's Big Words\\".<br /><br />So yeah, the book has a flaw here or there.  But it also fills a need.  However important you deem it that your children see positive images of whites during the Freedom Marches is your prerogative.  But don't pass \\"Martin's Big Words\\" by because it fails to fully display the diversity of the 60s in your eyes.  It's a great book with a great message.  It's also one of the few King bios that'll capture your seven-year-old's attention for longer than a minute.  A great addition to any library and a necessary purchase for anyone who wants to teach their small child about a magnificent man.kewed.

You tell a ten-year-old that you have a story about a boy who finds a mysterious dragon's egg and you'll probably have a convert before you've uttered so much as ten sentences.  But if you hold in your hot little hand an item that contains actual FACTS.... usually you're up a crik.  Not in the case of Phineas.  This book is so chock full of blood, splattered brains, busted skulls, and other goopy beginnings that your intended audience, whatever the age, will be hanging on your every word.  For the parent that wants their child to someday become a high priced neurologist, I highly suggest that you give them a little taste of \\"Phineas Gage\\" for a starter.<br /><br />Now imagine that you are Mr. Gage himself.  The year is 1848 and you're just an average railroad construction foreman.  Your job consists of blasting rock out of the way of the construction, allowing further tracks to be laid.  You're good at your job, and you've a custom-made tamping iron (thirteen-pound rod with a pointed end) to help you out.  Then, on September 13, 1848, you mess up.  It could happen to anyone.  One moment you're putting the highly combustible blasting powder down a hole.  The next minute you've turned your head in distraction and you've dropped your tamping iron down that selfsame hole.  The iron hits a piece of granite, produces a spark, and suddenly the iron has ripped through your left cheek, gone behind your left eyeball, and come up through the top of your head.  There's blood everywhere, brains on the iron, and a very surprised Phineas Gage sitting in the midst of it all.  You'd think a blast like that would kill a man, right?  Wrong.  Phineas not only is fine, he making entries into his time book as he goes to town for the doctor.  When the doctor isn't around, he then sits on the front steps of a nearby hotel and has a lengthy conversation with his landlord.  All the while there's blood everywhere and a clear view into Phineas's head to his brains.  And is Phineas completely unchanged by the experience?  Not quite.  Though he lives for quite some time after the accident, Phineas suddenly is bereft of all his social skills.  Why is this?  What does it mean about the brain itself?  And why did Phineas live?<br /><br />Like I said, there's gore galore in this puppy.  But better yet, there's a lot of sound scientific information for questioning young minds.  For those kids more interested in the accident itself, Phineas's skull is displayed throughout the book.  You can clearly make out where the hole once was, as well as how it healed over time.  Digitally rendered graphs show exactly how the tamping iron entered Mr. Gage's head and how it excited.  Historical information about the state of brain science in the late 1800's is coupled with what we know (and still do not know) now.  The book is filled with interesting photographs, graphs, and illustrations.  For further information there's a great list of resources, as well as a fabulous glossary, and a complete index.<br /><br />Now the author of this book is not a children's non-fiction author.  In fact, he's a science writer for the American Society for Cell Biology at the Harvard Medical School.  So how well does he write for young `uns?  The answer is pretty darn well.  Overall, Fleischman's text is tight and interesting.  He never launches into a speculation without making it very clear what the facts behind each and every matter are.  Unfortunately, the book does have an occasional dull moment.  Not being particularly thrilled with neuroscience myself, I found my eyes slipping over a page or two of brain facts that I didn't feel the need to backtrack and read.  Still, for the most part the book is a fascinating journey into a weird moment in history.<br /><br />So if your kid has been told in school that they MUST read and write about a non--fiction title of some sort, I highly recommend dear old \\"Phineas Gage\\" to you.  Never has any moment so gross rendered so great a discovery.d my eyes slipping over a page or two of brain facts that I didn't feel the need to backtrack and read.

Books	4	1	1	N	N	Goodnight moonlight ladies, rockabye sweet baby brains	We're all familiar with those insufferable parents whose sole goal in life seems to be to produce prodigiously intelligent offspring.  The kinds of people who pipe Mozart to their infants while still within the womb and, once born, force them to stare at countless hours of \\"Baby Einstein\\" on DVD.  Well what if their efforts paid off a little too well?  What if they got everything they wanted... and more?  Simon James is the author/illustrator who dares to pose that very question.  As the author himself says on his bookflap, \\"This story came along as many of my friends seemed to be having `clever' babies\\".  Taking these parents as his guide, he constructs a parent's dreamchild.  But be careful what you wish for.  You might just get it.<br /><br />Now Mr. and Mrs. Brains were determined to have an intelligent child.  They did all the right things you should do to insure a smart infant, short of devouring copious amounts of fish.  They read aloud to Mrs. Brains's pregnant tummy.  They played music at it.  They even turned up the sound on the tv when the news came on (which, depending on what station they were accustomed to watching, could have yielded some very interesting results).  So when their little Baby Brains was born they shouldn't have been too surprised at his brilliance.  Still, Baby Brains was extraordinary.  One day out of the womb and he was fixing the car.  Two days out of the womb and he was participating in school.  Two weeks and he was a doctor at the local hospital.  When the space program calls up, it seems only natural that Baby Brains would accept their offer to go into the wild blue yonder.  But with their baby's popularity, Mr. and Mrs. Brains see less of their child.  What will it take to get him back in their arms?  The answer is more obvious than you might think.<br /><br />This book is just as much about the trappings of fame as it is about the emotional needs of the very very smart.  The book's climax comes when Baby Brains is floating in space on a tether.  \\"Baby Brains looked up at the vast starlit sky above him.  He looked down at the vast starlit sky below him\\".  And finding himself in that state where the human being is floating like a fetus in a womb (you could probably write an entire thesis on the idea of the baby image from the movie \\"2001\\" now finding himself in the role of the astronaut) he lifts his head to the skies and cries out, \\"I want my mommy!\\".  Happy ending (and cute twist at the very very end) for all involved.  Simon James has a drawing style that conjures up the twisted pennings of Quentin Blake, only softer and sweeter.  The pictures are amusing and the plot downright whimsical.  All in all, if you're looking for a cute but intelligent picture book for your young `uns that was written in the last 5 or so years, \\"Baby Brains\\" is a sure-fire hit.

All your favorite characters are back.  Farmer Brown.  His eloquent cows.  His pigs.  His chickens.  And of course, the Duck.  Duck firmly establishes himself to be as quick with the pencil as the cows once were with their typewriters.  It is in \\"Giggle, Giggle, Quack\\" that he first truly comes into his own.<br /><br />Somewhere along the line, Farmer Brown figured out that the craftiest animal in his barnyard was that no good sneaky-peek Duck.  So when the farmer leaves on vacation, his tells his brother in no uncertain terms to \\"keep an eye on Duck.  He's trouble\\".  And sure enough, with the discovery of a wayward pencil, Duck starts taking farm matters into his own hands/beak.  He figures out that Farmer Brown left Bob, his bro, copious notes regarding the running of the farm.  It doesn't take long for Duck to deftly swap the farmer's notes for his own livestock friendly ones.  Before you know it, the farm animals are munching pizza, getting lovely spa-like baths, and enjoying \\"movie night\\" on Farmer Brown's couch.  When their absent landlord finally catches on via the telephone, Duck presents his babysitter with the note, \\"It's for you, Bob!\\".  The last image is of a Hawaiian-shirt wearing Farmer Bob pelting it quicktime back to the farm once again to restore some semblance of order.<br /><br />\\"Giggle, Giggle, Quack\\", doesn't have the snappy ending that \\"Click Clack Moo\\" had, admittedly.  And the phrase, \\"giggle, giggle, oink\\" (or whatever animal noise being used at the time), isn't really going to compare with the satisfying sounds of \\"click, clack, moo\\".  Still, there's a lot to enjoy here.  The animals take a special pleasure in outwitting the dullard humans around them.  Kids reading the book will enjoy pinpointing the exact moment that Farmer Brown's pencil slips from his back pocket and onto the ground.  And Duck's discovery of it is well accompanied by surreptitious glances exchanged between the cows.  For kids who've already grown to love these characters, \\"Giggle Giggle Quack\\" provides more of the same silly subversive fun.  For kids who've never encountered the series before, they'll probably still find something to enjoy here.  Though it's not the best written of the Cronin/Lewin combo, it's still a fine n' dandy way to spend a minute or two's worth of bedtime reading.ps from his back pocket and onto the ground.

First of all, people tend to shy away from writing picture books that have strong political messages in them.  And it is clear that any view of American involvement in Iraq is going to contain a slant one way or another.  Second, picture books are supposed to inspire and instruct.  How inspirational is it to look at the rising death toll and innocent lives taken during the course of this most peculiar of wars?  So it's little wonder that when several children's authors heard the story of Alia Muhammad Baker they felt moved to write her story out for children everywhere to hear.  One of the best of these is Jeanette Winter's, \\"The Librarian of Basra\\".  Though no book about Iraq is completely bereft of a political view of what we did, this story speaks beyond the immediate problems and looks to the future in a truly moving way.  It stands as perhaps one of the best ways to instruct little children about the war and its aftermath.<br /><br />As librarians go, Alia Muhammad Baker is a inspiration to her brethren.  When people started predicting the impending war in Basra, Alia was certain that the books would be destroyed.  These aren't just your shabby paperbacks or romance novels either.  Alia's collection was privy to owning a biography of Muhammad that was 700 years old, amongst its other treasures.  When pleas with the authorities to move the books yielded nothing, Alia went out and rescued the books herself.  She took them home, recruited friends and neighbors to help her remove them from the library, and hid them in her friend Anis Muhammad's restaurant.  Then, when the worst of the initial war was over, she transferred them into the homes of different people.  In the last pages the book notes that as the continuing skirmishes plague the landscape, \\"Alia waits\\".  She hopes for peace and a beautiful new library but until that happens she will keep her books safe and sound, wherever they may be.<br /><br />I'm a political beast by nature.  If I get the inkling that a picture is simplifying an issue to the point of banality (or idiocy) then I get upset.  I never got upset with \\"The Librarian of Basra\\".  Winter treats her subject with respect, dignity, and an even hand.  She gives us person who's life goal is understandable to kindergartner and senior citizen alike.  Alia was a rescuer of books.  A librarian who went beyond and above the call of duty.  If that isn't an example of heroism, what is?  It is clear from the book, also, that the war that plunged Alia into this trouble in the first place was not exactly necessary.  Oh, it never says this in so many words.  But kids who have somehow remained unaware of the cause behind the war may be confused as to why it suddenly bursts out of a clear blue sky the way it does.  Adults may have difficulty coming up with any answers, too.<br /><br />How well \\"The Librarian of Basra\\" will age is up for speculation.  The book ends with the fighting in Iraq continuing during American occupation.  How long that'll last is something few pundits agree on.  In any case, the tale of one woman's courage in the face of an inevitable war is stirring and heartening.  As a librarian myself, I have to admit I've a fondness for it on a personal level that may skew my otherwise faultless sense of what makes a book bad or good.  But it's important to remember that this book is a parable and, due to that format, will remain beloved long after Iraq reaches its final destiny.  For the sake of Alia, let us hope it is soon., wherever they may be. <br />  <br />I'm a political beast by nature.

And by perfect, I mean that they adeptly combine meaningful storylines that contain universal themes with plots and characters that kids are genuinely interested in.  \\"Charlotte's Web\\" is one of these.  And now, joining the ranks, comes another.  \\"The Crow-Girl\\" is a recent import from Danish author Bodil Bredsdorff. In this remarkably small but astoundingly well-written book, a girl sets out on a quest whose course she does not dictate and proceeds to create something she has needed all her life.  Kids may look at this book and shy away because it looks dull.  Don't let them.  This is one of the best books written in a very long time.  A deeply satisfying novel.<br /><br />The girl and her grandmother have lived in their tiny cottage by the sea for as long as the child remembers.  Brought up by this single relative, the girl has learned everything she needs to know about gathering food and staying alive on what the sea provides.  With her grandmother's death she at first plunges into misery, but continues to live and work.  In time, the girl sets off to find other human beings and runs across a variety of people.  She acquires the name of Crow-Girl due to her appearance and escapes the machinations of a cruel couple.  She rescues a boy from his depression-infused father and leads two women from starvation.  By the end of the tale the people she has helped and the life that she has led results in the formation of a small community and, more importantly, close-knit family to which the Crow-Girl now completely belongs.  This is a book about survival as well as what a person needs beyond food and water to truly be alive.  With a heroine you feel confident will never lack for anything and the two crows that seem to guide her on her journeys, it makes for a sometimes riveting, sometimes emotional, but always interesting book.<br /><br />By the end of the tale our heroine has gone from simply being referred to as a young girl to Crow-Girl, to finally being given a real name of her own.  And that, in a way, is a great way of explaining why this book is so good.  It's filled with remarkable details like that one.  Most importantly, the Crow-Girl isn't perfect.  This isn't some idealized child who spouts wisdom and goodwill wherever she goes.  She's just as prone to depression and mean-spirited thoughts as anyone.  At the same time though, she's remarkably accomplished due to her upbringing.  She has a love for the land, especially her little cove, that guides everything she does as well.  Translated with remarkable skill by Faith Ingwersen, this book is bound to convince any and all people that translated children's books should be ten times as common as they currently are today.  This is one of those small perfect jewels that are sometimes so hard to find.  I seriously hope that more people will read and discover \\"The Crow-Girl\\" as time goes by.

First of all, if you haven't gone out and viewed their \\"Dinosaurs of Waterhouse Hawkins\\" then you should do so immediately.  Do not halt for man, angel, or beast.  Just get out there, grab yourself a copy, and thank the high heavens that you did so before reaching the end of your brief span upon this globe.  After having read that book (and you will be glad you did) you'll be ready to fully appreciate this author/illustrator duo's latest exploration into another fabulous human being's life.  Our dear gay American poet Walt Whitman is their most recent subject and he is rendered here in full glorious life.  Spotted with his poetry, his beliefs, and his incredible life, \\"Walt Whitman: Words For America\\" offers an answer to any kid who wonders why the heck they should study some old dead white guy from more than 100 years ago.  A stirring answer at that.<br /><br />Aside from the circular picture of Walt standing with a cocky fist on his hip, your first image in this book of the man displays him at the tender age of 12.  Working carefully as a typesetter for a newspaper (comparisons to Ben Franklin seem obvious at this point), Walt began his career as a poet with a job that put him into direct messy contact with all kinds of letters and words.  In addition to creating his own newspaper at 19, Walt read fantastical stories for his own amusement.  You see him as a young man rushing through the streets of Manhattan fully clothed and along the beaches of Long Island buck naked (tastefully, of course).  As Walt grew, his concern for fellow human beings, including the slaves of the South, did as well.  He published \\"Leaves of Grass\\", traveled the country, then became involved with the war between the states.  It's the Civil War that takes up most of Walt's life in this book.  Whether he was tending to those wounded in battle, debating his own feelings towards President Lincoln, or collapsing from the exhaustion of working too darn hard, the book follows Whitman hither and thither.  By the end Whitman truly became the poet of the people, giving the world poems that have remained deeply embedded in the human psyche, whether we know it or not.<br /><br />As with their previous collaboration, Kerly and Selznick follow up their book with a long and extended section of additional facts about Mr. Whitman.  They talk about how they become interested in the project, where their research took them, and how they feel about the man.  They offer addition info on his life (preferring not to mention the whole homosexual aspect, I guess), Lincoln's life, and what Walt's life was like after the war.  They also include eight poems, some complete and some just important snippets.  It makes for a truly comprehensive picture book, I can tell you.<br /><br />The book itself, however, is a visual delight.  There are some truly gutsy moves being made within its pages.  At one point you see only a bright blue sky containing a yellow sun and fast moving clouds containing the words, \\"Whoever you are now I place my hand upon you that you be my poem\\".  At another point Selznick takes the photographs of the wounded holding slates and puts a word from a Whitman poem on each and every one.  I was pleased to note that the authentic daguerreotypes that Selznick has reproduced here include black as well as white soldiers (something not every illustrator would think to include).  Finally, in a truly cute move, Selznick just barely includes the two oranges and paper crane he found at Whitman's grave in the picture of the same.<br /><br />As picture biographies go, this one is wordy but worth it.  Kerley knows how to write an exciting tale and Whitman makes for a remarkably exciting personality.  He's one of those heroes you aren't ashamed to call as such.  A wonderful addition for anyone whose juvenile Whitman section seems a bit lacking.lapsing from the exhaustion of working too darn hard, the book follows Whitman hither and thither.

Which is, of course, precisely what he did.  While \\"Golem\\" was a vast creative epic that utilized his particularly original cut-paper technique to its best advantage,  \\"Ducky\\" is a small clever story written by fellow Caldecott winner Eve Bunting and set through the eyes of a plastic toy on the high seas.  It has emotional impact, beautiful illustrations, and a true story behind its tale.  Altogether it makes for a delicious picture book.<br /><br />On the title page we see large wooden create being lowered onto what can only be the deck of an ocean liner.  Turn the page and the ship is silhouetted against a sky, followed closely by an impending storm.  Our story begins.  As the duck himself says right off the bat, \\"I am a yellow plastic duck and I am in great danger\\".  With the horrible storm, the crate containing Ducky and his hundred some fellow toys is released into the violent sea.  The crate breaks apart and suddenly the water is filled with yellow ducks, blue turtles, green frogs, and what looks to be red beavers.  The duck experiences great fear, particularly when a passing shark (rendered in its pupil-less-many-toothed glory) attempts to devour a load of toys.  The duck notes that the shark does not seem too much care for getting plastic caught in its teeth, \\"though we are guaranteed non-toxic\\".  Days pass and all the toys separate in the waves.  Our lone hero bobs alone, night and day, past icebergs, fish, and pelicans, until washing safely ashore.  A boy locates the duck with glee (it seems many residents of this Alaskan town along the coast have been finding and recording the lost bathtub paraphernalia).  At long last the duck returns with the boy to his home and is placed in a bubbly frothy bath, thereby, \\"fulfilling my destiny\\".<br /><br />An author's note at the end records the 29,000 plastic toy animals that were washed off a ship in 1992 and how their arrival on the shores of North America aided scientists who wished to learn more about currents, winds and tides.  But even if this were some inspired flight of fancy on the part of the writer, it would still make for a fabulous tale.  Ducky has an odd wry way of speaking.  He notes his predicament with great emotion and intensity.  Feelings that kids reading this book will readily appreciate and understand.  From the scary notion of being lost to the final arrival in a safe place, there's a lot to identify with in this book.  Wisniewski really brings this story fully to life, though.  His shark is a nasty frighteningly realistic critter o' the sea.  But I was really taken with the beautiful shots in the book.  There's an aerial point of view of Ducky from above red, yellow, beige clouds in what can only be the early stages of twilight.  His sea is a beautiful pulsating series of blue and white images.  Some artists work with cut-paper and make you wonder how they managed to create their elegant scenes.  Others take this one step farther and let you forget that what you're looking at wasn't created by a computer or drawn by hand.  Wisniewski does both.<br /><br />You're going to find quite a few rubber-ducks-lost-at-sea books out there (Eric Carle's, \\"10 Little Rubber Ducks\\" comes to mind) but this is the best of the lot.  A fine collaboration between two Caldecott winning heavyweights it has everything a good children's picture book should have.  Danger, excitement, and a happy ending advocating cleanliness (amongst other things).

From the scary notion of being lost to the final arrival in a safe place, there's a lot to identify with in this book.  Wisniewski really brings this story fully to life, though.  His shark is a nasty frighteningly realistic critter o' the sea.  But I was really taken with the beautiful shots in the book.  There's an aerial point of view of Ducky from above red, yellow, beige clouds in what can only be the early stages of twilight.  His sea is a beautiful pulsating series of blue and white images.  Some artists work with cut-paper and make you wonder how they managed to create their elegant scenes.  Others take this one step farther and let you forget that what you're looking at wasn't created by a computer or drawn by hand.  Wisniewski does both.   <br />  <br />You're going to find quite a few rubber-ducks-lost-at-sea books out there (Eric Carle's, \\"10 Little Rubber Ducks\\" comes to mind) but this is the best of the lot.  A fine collaboration between two Caldecott winning heavyweights it has everything a good children's picture book should have.  Danger, excitement, and a happy ending advocating cleanliness (amongst other things).  This rubber ducky is truly the one. <br />	2005-02-21

So it only stands to reason that writing a children's biography of a private person who led a public life would be ten times as hard.  Children's biographies cannot speculate over the sex life of the subject.  They can't delve into shoddy rumors or dredge up conspiracy theories related to the person's sordid background.  None of this is to say that Marian Anderson had such sketchy rumors floating about her person, of course.  By all accounts she led an exciting life, had a fabulous career, and is regarded as a great American hero.  But she was also a private person, which places Russell Freedman in a difficult position.  As the author of, \\"The Voice That Challenged a Nation\\", Freedman's job is to tell Anderson's story while relying on as many good, strong, clean facts as he can get his hands on.  Fortunately, we're talking about the premiere biographical children's author here.  Alongside fellow genius James Giblin, Freedman knows exactly how to present a life this interesting and detailed.  The book will not charm every child assigned it in school.  But if you've a kid who's open-minded and able to get into Marian's struggle, this is an excellent resource.  Even if, prior to this book, they couldn't tell Marian Anderson from Ella Fitzgerald.<br /><br />The book opens with what is inarguably Anderson's greatest moment in the public eye.  She stands on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial with a crowd of 75,000 people below her, waiting to hear her sing.  The date is April 9, 1939, and Anderson has been refused the chance to perform at Constitution Hall.  Anderson is black and the DAR (Daughters of the American Revolution) is inherently racist.  With this concert, under the shadow of Lincoln himself, Anderson gives a heckuva performance that stands as a dignified response to racism in America.  It goes very well and from here we shoot back and see Ms. Anderson's life in full.  From her early days as a choir member in Philadelphia to her triumphant European tour in the early 30s.  Certain aspects of Marian's life repeat themselves.  She was wholly dedicated to her mother and took her everywhere.  She was uncertain of her own talents at times but continued to sing and conquer.  Freedman expertly weaves fascinating aspects of Marian's life (example: her high school boyfriend waited some twenty years to marry her) with factual information about the times in which she lived.  Kids who read this book learn just as much about Jim Crow laws and deeply imbedded segregation as they do about Ms. Anderson's life.  By the end of the book you find yourself emerging with a fascinating look at a truly great woman.<br /><br />Freedman follows up this book with an extensive bibliography (which gives props to fellow fabulous child biography, \\"When Marian Sang\\" by Pam Munoz Ryan).  There's also a discography, a series of picture credits, and a wonderful index.  It seems petty to demand that an author (or publisher) bend even farther backwards after producing such a gorgeous book, but I was a teensy bit sad that \\"The Voice That Challenged a Nation\\" didn't have a small cd accompanying it.  When you read a quote, like the one from opera and concert singer Jessye Norman saying that, \\"If the planet Earth could sing, I think it would sound like Marian Anderson\\", you want to hear that voice.  Not just read about it.  But as I said, them's small potatoes.  As it is, this may be one of those few children's books that inspire kids to search for Marian Anderson recordings on itunes (which has a lovely selection, by the way).<br /><br />With some authors, you know to trust them.  You pick up their latest work without a smidgen of doubt in your mind that what you're about to peruse is going to impress you.  After Freedman won my respect with his glorious, \\"Eleanor Roosevelt: A Life of Discovery\\" (Eleanor shows up quite a lot in this book as well, I'm pleased to report), Iexpected nothing but the best from his Marian Anderson bio.  And the best it is.  A fine selection for any library, whether personal or public, anywhere.eport), I expected nothing but the best from his Marian Anderson bio.  And the best it is.

The pictures are repetitive with very little detail and a heroine who's mouth is permanently agape.  What's to love?  But then there's that part of my brain that looks beyond the obvious hairline faults of an otherwise near perfect creation.  If Gossie looks the same from page to page, that's because such repetitions are adored by early readers everywhere.  If her story is not a rousing shoot-em-up escapade, it makes up for it by being a lovely simple story told with the ideal amount of words and images.  And if Gossie is not your typical gosling heroine, it may well be that original appearance that makes her so darned appealing in the first place.  \\"Gossie\\" may not be the greatest preschooler tome ever penned, but you'd have a hard time conjuring up a list of any that are better.<br /><br />Storywise, there's not much to say.  Gossie loves her bright red boots.  A chronic mouth breather, she spends her days stomping around and about in the aforementioned attire.  One day, however, the boots are nowhere to be found.  In a state of panic so intense that she shuts her beak in misery, Gossie searches high and low.  All seems lost until she finds that the boots are walking.  \\"On someone else's feet!\\".  Her fellow gosling, Gertie, compliments her on her choice of footwear and by the end of the tale the two are stomping about, one boot on each gosling's foot.<br /><br />Aside from the fact that the book teaches good heartfelt lessons about sharing and not getting mad when younger friends/siblings purloin one's belongings, the books a heckuva lotta fun to read.  Gossie herself is entirely enticing.  Dunrea has drawn her with fine pen and inks and filled her bright yellow body in with swaths of yellow.  Her adventures (prior to the boot loss) teach kids about the wonders of uphill, downhill, rain, snow, backwards, forwards, etc.  The words are simple enough for kids to grasp but presented in a charming package.  If I someday make a list of preschooler-books-parents-can-read-twenty-times-over-without-gagging, this will undoubtedly be number one.  Heck, you could read it one hundred times without cease and still find yourself charmed by its plucky little ending.  Few will marvel over the fact that this book garnered itself several sequels.<br /><br />In the world of preschooler picture books written with little hands in mind, \\"Gossie\\" takes the cake.  It's that rare breed of book that appeals to the sensibilities of Harvard educated yuppie parents and their applesauce smeared two-year-old heirs.  A fine fine purchase.s are simple enough for kids to grasp but presented in a charming package.

Most children's books about mental or physical ailments are not good.  I know we're all familiar with the tiny few that are spectacular and make it into mainstream culture.  But by and large, if an author has sat down and decided to write a story specifically about *blank* disease, (paging \\"What's Happening To Grandpa?\\") the book is probably going to be sloppy, overly sympathetic, or just plain awful.  And this, ladies and gentlemen, is NOT the case with \\"Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key\\".  It could have been.  Had Jack Gantos decided to phone-in this story, as it were, the book could easily have been out and out terrible.  Gantos could've made his protagonist a sweet saint at the mercy of a dreaded disease.  He could have given Joey cutesy phrases to say (ala \\"Ida B\\") that show all the adults around him the true meaning of life/being happy/understanding people who are different.  He didn't.  He made Joey understandable but still a flawed human being who has problems that go beyond medication.  It makes \\"Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key\\" a surprisingly thoughtful book.<br /><br />When Joey's mom first appears on his doorstep, he doesn't think much of it.  Sure, he's been waiting for him mom to come back to him for years.  But after living so long with his grandmother, Joey's got his own way of doing things.  Everyone on one side of his family suffers from severe ADHD.  That means that when he and his grandmother are feeling high they can run around the house playing rough tag.  When they're low, she may attempt to stuff him in the refrigeration.  With the reappearance of his mother, however, Joey finds himself in a stable home with a guardian who loves him and looks out for him.  Still, things are not good for Joey in school.  He does well enough in the mornings, when his medication is going strong.  By the time the afternoon rolls around, however, he's literally bouncing off the walls and getting into the kinds of trouble not entirely the fault of his ADHD complex.  The threat of being sent to a separate special education facility is hanging over his head, but it isn't until Joey has some unfortunate run-ins with the Amish and ends up wreaking havoc with a fellow student's nose that he begins to find that the good thing about hitting rock bottom is that there's nowhere to go but up.<br /><br />I once had the pleasure of seeing author Jack Gantos speak, and he mentioned that one of the greatest results to come out of his authorship of this book is that children will come up to him after reading it and say, \\"We have a kid in our class who's just like Joey.  We used to think he was sooo annoying but now we can see he's just got a problem\\".  If that's the legacy of \\"Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key\\", then it's a great one.  What Gantos does so well is make Joey, even at the height of his worst manias, sympathetic.  Also, you find yourself laughing at his predicaments, even as you pity the reasons he got in those predicaments in the first place.  As swallowing things go in children's literature, I believe Joey Pigza's wayward housekey will join the lofty ranks of Fudge's pet turtle in \\"Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing\\".<br /><br />In 1999 this book lost the Newbery Award to the one book in the last ten years I could understand beating it.  \\"Holes\\" by Louis Sacher.  It's just a bum piece of luck that the two books had to come out the exact same year.  Otherwise, and I think anyone who's read this book can agree, this tale would've been a shoo-in.  As it stands, \\"Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key\\" is just the first in a long line of popular Joey titles.  Few people will contest its excellent plotting, fine characters, and great storytelling.  Kids actually enjoy reading this book, people.  That alone should indicate to you just how good it is.  Belongs on every library shelf (personal and public) in the English speaking world.  Highly (as ifI could leave you in any doubt) recommended.ghly (as if I could leave you in any doubt) recommended. <br />	2005-02-18

When an arachnid lodges itself in the upper right hand corner of my shower, it's me (not my hubby) who forces it into an empty glass and releases it back into the wilderness (i.e. out the window).  I don't think they're particularly cute, but I respect what they do.  Similarly, I didn't think I had any problems with tarantulas either.  I'd never held one or stared one in the eight eyes, but I wasn't about to freak out over reading Sy Montgomery's excellent addition to the \\"Scientists In the Field\\" series.  It was with zero reluctance that I plucked \\"The Tarantula Scientist\\" from its shelf and proceeded to page through it.  Just my bad luck that such paging began with a stomach churning view of young gooey transparent tail whip scorpions riding on their mother's back, really.  To my infinite surprise I found portions of this book grotesque, other parts, disturbing, and every single page can't-physically-tear-my-eyes-away fascinating.  For any kid vaguely considering transferring their love of the creepy crawlies into a full time career, this book is a must-have.  Just keep a firm grip on your phobias while you peruse it.<br /><br />Our hero is named Sam Marshall.  He's an average college professor (go Hiram!) with a truly above-average obsession.  Marshall loves tarantulas.  He loves to travel to distant rainforests and observe them in the wild.  He loves to tend to his five hundred live spiders in Hiram College's Spider Lab.  But most of all, he loves to discover new and interesting things about the species.  Tarantulas, as it happens, are relatively mysterious creatures.  No one in the scientific community has ever taken the time to understand their growth rates, space needs, ways of creating homes, social obligations, etc.  No one until now, that is.  With Sam at the your side, the book takes the reader up close and personal with these magnificent lords of the jungle floor.  You watch as Sam coaxes a Goliath birdeater tarantula out of its hole.  You thrill to see (in graphic color photographs that could win awards for presentation alone) these tarantulas as they shed their furry spiky skins.  You cower as Sam navigates a snake ridden cave floor to capture more and more tarantulas for his needs.  From the comfort and calm of Ohio to the dangerous but beautiful forests of French Guiana the daring life of an arachnologist has never been so thrillingly portrayed.<br /><br />This book won the coveted Sibert Honor as one of the best non-fiction books of the year.  It's hardly a surprise though.  First of all, the pairing of author Sy Montgomery with photographer Nic Bishop is nothing short of inspired.  Sy's text makes scientist Sam Marshall come alive for child readers.  Through him they learn how one becomes a world premiere tarantula specialist.  The book intersperses factual information about the spiders with the actions Sam takes from place to place.  Best of all, the book includes a fabulous selected bibliography, spider websites of note, info on French Guiana, and a portion discussing what to do if you're thinking of buying your own personal tarantula.  None of this cold hard information keeps Montgomery from placing little moments of reflection in his text as well.  A discussion of a hike through the rainforest notes that finding answers to science questions, \\"means long hikes through a wet, warm rainforest where even the sunlight glows green through the leaves\\".  And the book really shows how scientific discoveries are made.  Kids in school might be under the mistaken impression that all facts about the known world are... well... known.  But by reading this book we watch and Sam notices something about a spider (it makes a noise, possibly with its legs), tests a theory (by shaving the spider's legs), and reaches a logical conclusion (the noise DOES come from the legs!).  What other book does this so well, I dare ask?<br /><br />And still there are the pictures.  Oh the pictures.  Bright beautiful full page color pictures that can't help but grab your attention.  You see crazy insects, a bag FULL of empties tarantula skins (mesmerizing to say the least), webs, a tarantula flinging spikes at an opponent, and more.  My sole regret was that the book goes on for some time about the beauty of a rare bird (whose name Amazon.com won't let me write here, doggone it), but never shows us so much as a glimpse.<br /><br />All in all, spiders have never been so well documented and presented for the general child reader public.  If you're tired of wearing socks all the time and wouldn't mind getting your socks knocked off, here is the place to start.

When I reviewed \\"Shabanu: Daughter of the Wind\\" (a tale about a Pakistani nomadic daughter and her struggle against repression), I characterized it as a slow moving epic.  The kind of thing that kids should read but that if you forced it down their gullets they'd immediately detest.  And though \\"The Shadows of Ghadames\\" is similar to \\"Shabanu\\" in a number of ways, I simply cannot repeat this advice.  Here we have a small, unassuming, but brilliantly succinct encapsulation of the maturity of a young woman in late nineteenth century southern Libya.  The book is fascinating and short, but says everything in its mere 118 pages that needs to be said.  Unlike some historical fiction novels written for children, I'll be recommending this book to any and every kid I see.  It's an infinitely interesting look at a world unlike our own but can (as \\"Shabanu\\" author Suzanne Fisher Staples says in her blurb on the back of the book), \\"explore universal truths about the condition of being human\\".<br /><br />Once again Malika's father is taking off from the city of Ghadames to sell his wares to lands distant from his daughter's home.  As a girl, Malika is finding the freedoms she experienced as a child curtailed with the approach of puberty.  Soon she will be condemned to remain on the rooftops of the city where all the women live, like her mother and her father's second wife Bilkisu.  Malika challenges a society where she isn't allowed to learn to read and where the only garden she'll soon be seeing is the red one painted on the walls of the roofs.  It isn't long before such brooding is changed to fear, however, when she and Bilkisu discover an injured man, hunted by the townspeople for preaching a different religion.  Without Malika's father around, the women take it upon themselves to hide and tend to the wounded man.  Through this act of kindness, Malika grows to learn more about the world of the women, far above the ground, and what they are truly capable of in spite of their entrapment.<br /><br />It was with great shock that I reached the end of this book, only to discover that \\"The Shadows of Ghadames\\" has been translated from the original text to what we read here.  Originally the work of French author Joelle Stolz, the prose is lyrical and fascinating, without the stilted sentences that sometimes pepper a translated work.  Better still, this book is interesting from page one onwards.  There's a thrilling blindfolded race across a roof, lurid descriptions of the celebrations women have on their own, and complicated relations that never rely on black and white stereotypes.  In most novels like this one, the young man rescued would turn out to have a saintly disposition and would teach Malika how to be her own woman.  Stolz turns this convention on its head, instead having the young man sneer at the ministrations of the women, angrily curse their ignorance (which he sees as willful), and teaches Malika to read possibly because he has nothing else to do.  Likewise, the fact that Malika's father has two wives at first seems peaceful and without conflict.  Later we learn that the situation was initially very tenuous and it was only with the birth of Malika herself that each woman came to terms with the other.<br /><br />This world is entirely unlike most that children read about in books.  Stolz has created something new and fascinating.  It's a land where the cries of women throughout the day, from rooftop to rooftop, tell the news.  Where an entire citizenry remains above the actions of the men below.  And best of all, it's a truly interesting book.  There are no easy answers in \\"The Shadows of Ghadames\\".  And there isn't that Hollywood happy ending where everything turns out hunky-dory at the finale.  There's just a tale of how the oppressed can still live fulfilling lives in spite of their prisons.

Rowling burst upon the kiddie lit scene was an author as adept at mysterious child-tempting titles as Mr. John Christopher.  In this, the third in the great Tripods trilogy (with a lovely prequel following for those of you still addicted to the series after this book) we finally see the last battles with the nasty Masters and their horrid tripod contraptions.  In some ways, this book is a bit of a disappointment when it comes to the last scenes.  In other ways, it speaks nobly of the role of peace in the world and how we should sacrifice everything to attain it (a message that strikes harder today than ever).<br /><br />In this tale we meet up one last time with our headstrong hero Will.  Unlike most storybook protagonists, Will isn't afraid to tell you his faults right off the bat.  He's easy to irritate, foolish, and prone to spontaneous acts that could easily lead to his own destruction.  Then again, if it weren't for Will the battle against the tripods would be in bad shape.  In \\"The City of Gold and Lead\\", our hero had finagled his way into the trust of the evil Masters that have conquered planet Earth.  He's discovered their ultimate plan (changing earth's atmosphere to gasses breathable only by Masters and not humans) and escaped with his life and some samples.  Now he's once again stationed in the White Mountains and has to take a large part in the final destruction of the three tripod cities and, therefore, their grasp on the planet Earth.  In the course of this book, Will partakes of a special covert operation into the city he once escaped, learns to fly a balloon, brews illegal hootch, watches men die before his eyes, and finally discovers what his true calling in life was meant to be.<br /><br />As with the previous books in the series, don't go reading this tale if you're interested in reading about... oh say... girls.  They do not exist.  They especially do not exist in this book (with the sole exception of Will's memory of the once beautiful, now taxidermied, Eloise).  Even after the tripods leave, a meeting is called of all the leaders of the world entitled, \\"The Conference of Man\\".  Author John Christopher may have been under the odd assumption that including a single woman in this series would have instantly turned it into a girly book and that no red-blooded male would deign to pick up a novel in the \\"Tripods\\" series for that very reason.  Or maybe he just didn't like women.  It's something to ponder anyway.  In any case, the number of ladies in this books equals zippo.  Just FYI.<br /><br />Also, the book is a bit of a letdown at the end.  I was far too used to the gripping hunt sequence at the end of \\"The White Mountains\\" and the desperate fight for escape at the finale of \\"The City of Gold and Lead\\".  By comparison, the finish of \\"The Pool of Fire\\" is a disappointment.  There are exciting sequences in it, sure.  But the final confrontations with the enemy lack any real (for lack of a better word) confrontation.  You never see the enemy surrender.  Never hear their cries of remorse.  They just sorta give up and take off.  Not a particularly dramatic way to draw a close to a relatively great sci-fi series.  What's interesting is that Christopher almost makes up for this in the end.  He's clever enough not to leave the ending as a happy-go-lucky ain't-life-grand sweep.  Instead, people are bickering just as they were before the tripods came.  And our heroes find their lives' works are going to go in entirely new directions.  It's a great way to conclude the series.  Just a pity that the action scenes ran so dull.<br /><br />This series could not be written today as it once was for any number of reasons.  Yet it remains popular and remembered by large groups of children everywhere.  Kids love the Tripods series and I would be loathe to warn them away.  It's just a pity that \\"The Pool of Fire\\" fails to deliver the goods.  It's fun, a great romp, and an interesting consideration of whether liberty breeds contempt.  It may not be the strongest finale ever written, but it has its heart in the right place.ether liberty breeds contempt.

Crazy colors, unique new thoughts conceived in the streets, a new acceptance of people who were different from us, THIS is the legacy we can credit to that time.  And did children's  books remain unaffected by this shift in cultural consciousness?  Not a jot!  Take the 1968 \\"Drummer Hoff\\" by Barbara Emberly.  Now that's a Caldecott winner, my friends.  But the wacky 60s didn't affect just Hoff and his warlike tendencies.  Sorche Nic Leodhas's, \\"Always Room For One More\\" is a truly fascinating look at how artists in the children's publishing world were experimenting with new techniques and presentations.  While the story behind this book is rather staid and normal, the art found within is a topsy-turvy combination of different styles, techniques, and forms.  A beautiful book that remains quite lovely to the eye.<br /><br />Written in slightly Americanized Scottish brogue, the book tells the tale of a man, his wife, and their, \\"bairns to the number of ten\\" who live in a small cottage by themselves.  Always kind and generous, their patriarch Lachie MacLachlan (can't beat it) is apt to invite anyone he sees to come and stay with him and his family.  So before you know it the house contains the original family of 12 plus a tinker, a tailor, a sailor, a gallowglass, a fishing lass, a merry ault wife, four peat-cutters, a ranter, and a shepherd with his dog.  Everyone has a gay old time dancing and partying about but though the family may have heart as large as the ocean, there's the actual physical problem of how large the house is and how much it can take.  Before anyone knows what's happening, the walls and roof are \\"dinged down\\" and everyone finds themselves sprawled outside without a house anymore.  This could be dire.  This could be bleak.  But fortunately the people invited to the home are caring souls so they build a much bigger house for the family of ten.  One that could contain any number of strangers Lachie and his MacLachlans invite.  Happy ending for one and all.<br /><br />The tale this most represents, to my mind, is Pete Seeger's fabuous \\"Foolish Frog\\" song/book.  And to be frank, the Seeger version is twice as catchy and three times as funny as Leodhas's tale.  Still, there's a lot to love in this book.  Leodhas includes a bit of background at the end of her tale, along with a Scottish to English glossary of terms.  For those of you who didn't know what a Gallowglass was, this is the place to find out (no, it has nothing to do with glass).  There's even sheet music for the musically inclined prone to singing their children's books aloud.  But as I mentioned earlier, it's Nonny Hogrogian's illustrations that catch the eye here.  Alongside the beautiful cross-hatched pen and ink illustrations are tufts of green, purple, and grey.  Unfortunately for me, the book I was reading didn't have any explanations of how Hogrogian created these pictures.  But however it was, they're truly evocative.  The cliffs are particularly cliffy.  The heather and gorse cheery and dour all at the same time.  The whole book seems to take place against a grey cloudy sky, but there's a lightheartedness that defies the awful weather.  True, all the children (once we get close) seem to look exactly the same only with different styles of hair, but that doesn't distract from the distant landscape scenes in the least.<br /><br />The book is a fine way for anyone to connect children to the Scottish heritage in some way.  It's a fun little book, though I would certainly recommend that it be read aloud by someone adept at Scottish brogue.  Otherwise it might come off sounding a bit odd.  Though certainly not one of the most memorable of the Caldecott Award winners (try finding one in the New York Public Library and see how many copies you find), it's still an enjoyable little number.

351722:US	49148452	R43ZV61SEFBQ0	0439114942	363295800	The Dinosaurs of Waterhouse Hawkins (Caldecott Honor Book)	Books	5	38	38	N	N	Everybody do the dinosaur	Occasionally, from time to time, I like to trick little children.  And as a children's librarian in a public library, I have plenty of time and opportunity to do so.  So when I'm in the right mood and I feel particularly devilish, I mosey on over to the biography section of the library and ever-so-casually pull out \\"The Dinosaurs of Waterhouse Hawkins\\".  After determining that no one has seen me, I then amble over to the picture book area and prominently display the book.  The bait now laid, I go back to my desk and wait in anticipation.  It doesn't take long.  Soon the attractive cover of the book (showing a man holding a dinosaur model with a gigantic dinosaur head looming behind him) catches the eye of some wayward traipsing tot.  The child will look at it, squeal gleefully, and pluck the item from the shelf without so much as a howdy-doo.  My job complete, I sit back and soak in just how clever I am.  You see, the kid doesn't know it yet, but I've tricked `em.  They thought they were finding just another of the thousands of millions of dinosaur books out there WHEN IN FACT this book is different.  It is a highly educational biography of the man who helped bring dinosaurs to the forefront of the human imagination.  The book may well be many a child's first biography for this very reason.  So while they think they're getting another dino book, they are in fact getting an entirely different critter altogether.  It's an incredibly satisfying feeling to get a child to read something quite as good and original as this particular book.  I do not regret my actions in the least.<br /><br />Author Barbara Kerley explains in her afterword where she got the gumption to write about Waterhouse Hawkins in the first place.  She was flipping through a book of dinosaurs one day when she came across a most peculiar picture.  In it sat a group of refined late 1800s gentlemen having a formal dinner.  In the belly of a dinosaur.  Further research yielded a name and a fascinating story.  Waterhouse Hawkins was born in London in 1807.  He grew up with an interest in animalia, but with the discovery of dinosaur bones he quickly shifted his interests.  As an artist, Hawkins worked diligently to create true to life full-sized dinosaur models.  Though we today look at them with a critical eye (they had some real innate flaws to them) at the time they were considered the cutting edge of scientific vision.  Hawkins grew in prominence (in no small part due to the aforementioned let's-eat-dinner-in-a-dinosaur idea) and even created a group of them for the grand opening of the Crystal Palace at Sydenham Park.  Unfortunately, once Hawkins moved to America he was bound to come into contact with that nefarious New York politican, the corruptous of the corrupt, \\"Boss\\" Tweed.  Though Hawkins had been given funding to construct a museum of dinosaurs in Central Park, Tweed diverted funds and (adding injury to insult) probably hired a group of goons to destroy Hawkins' models.  But did our intrepid expatriate give in even then?  No, sir!  He went on to create the development of life on Earth at Princeton and made dinosaurs for the Smithsonian.  By the time he died he'd lived a rich and wonderful life.<br /><br />Barbara Kerley backs up all her interesting Hawkins info with a remarkable Author's Note section at the end of the book encompassing the models, the artist, Tweed, the Crystal Palace, as well as illustrator Brian Selznick's works.  And the text is remarkably interesting.  In fact, it closes by pointing out that because Boss Tweed's goons buried many of Hawkins' models, they may still be located somewhere deep beneath Central Park to this day.  Brian Selznick is just as laudable an artist in this venture though.  First of all, the book is presented as a kind of 1800s document.  The title page is part announcement to a theatrical presentation part scholarly text.  At the end of the book we can see the original menu feasted upon by Hawkins and his scientificcronies in the belly of one of his models.  The book is perhaps most remarkable because of its dark moments.  And it is here that Selznick really shines.  Our encounter with Boss Tweed shows a gray formal portrait of the man with watery malicious eyes.  After the destruction of his creations there's a remarkable two-page spread of Hawkins holding his head in sorrow in the midst of complete and utter destruction.  The next pages show a rainy windswept Central Park with a single black figure making his way across the expanse.  Heck!  There's even a section at the back of the book showing how Hawkins once drew his dinos and how we know they look today.<br /><br />The most difficult task of any biographical picture book is make the subject both interesting and factual.  Kerley and Selznick have done this with aplomb.  And unlike some life stories transferred to a mere 48 pages or so, this book has a distinctive rise and fall to the action.  All in all it's a remarkable story in an attractive package that any small child could instantly take to.  One of the best picture book biographies I have ever had the delight to read.

That'll do.	At first you read the premise of this, the first Miss Bindergarten picture book, and you find it a bit too much.  Not only is this an alphabet book, not ONLY is this a getting-ready-for-school book, but this is also a learn your animals book.  Not since Graham Base's, \\"Water Hole\\" has an author tried to do so much in a single item intended (after all) for the early reader set.  And yet, remarkably, \\"Miss Bindergarten\\" is all these things and more.  A rollicking raucous encapsulation of ALL the things a kindergarten teacher must do before a single one of her students has entered the room, the book's a pip.  I mean, it's impossible to dislike this story.  It's a fun read, a collection of truly charming illustrations, and a great way to introduce kids to the concept of school itself.  For the child just beginning to learn away from home, this is an ideal gift or present.<br /><br />Our opening pages show a lovely border collie being woken at 6:00 in the morning by her peppy little cuckoo clock.  With her pet cockatoo in tow we watch as Miss Bindergarten (for so she is) goes about her morning by washing her face, finding a lot pair of shoes and eating a bagel with the morning paper.  Then she's off with a full trunk and a yawning cockatoo.  In the meantime, various students in alphabetical order are getting ready for kindergarten in their own ways.  \\"Adam Krupp wakes up. Brenda Heath brushes her teeth\\".  Every once in a while we cut back to Miss Bindergarten who's tidying up a long abandoned schoolroom, frantically separating tinker toys, hanging mobiles, etc.  As she does so it's difficult not to notice the post-it note stuck to her rear, and a forgotten price tag hanging from her blouse's collar.  Time passes, more students come near, and in the end Miss Bindergarten's room is complete. \\"And - oh, oh, oh! - the fun's begun!\\".  A helpful key at the end of the book shows that each student is an animal with the same first letter as his or her name.  Therefore, reticent Ian is an iguana and cool Xavier is (believe it or not) a xenosaurus.<br /><br />Now author Joseph Slate has written a lovely story and I'm certainly inclined to give him kudos for that.  But hats off, ladies and gentlemen, to illustrator Ashley Wolff.  I've seen plenty of charming elementary school teachers in children's books (Mr. Slinger from \\"Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse\\", for example), but Miss Bindergarten has an air of authenticity about her that's hard to top.  Sure, she's a border collie.  But look at her corduroy jumper with the rainbow shirt beneath.  Look at her Miss Frizzle-like crazy shoes and that necklace of bright wooden beads around her neck.  Miss Bindergarten is so doggone (ho ho) realistic that I have a very difficult time not believing that she wasn't modeled on someone specific.  Artist Wolff has crafted a sparkling series of unique illustrations, filled with important details and interesting sights.  I mean, who can resist the picture that accompanies the line, \\"Fran Lister kisses her sister\\".  Does Fran kiss a frog smaller to herself?  No!  She kisses a tadpole in a highchair wearing a bonnet.  THAT is the mark of an illustrator who is paying careful attention to her characters, my friends.  THAT is the mark of a wonderfully drawn book.<br /><br />Perhaps \\"Miss Bindergarten Gets Ready For Kindergarten\\"'s greatest accomplishment is that it really is a love letter to teachers everywhere.  It shows just how hard they work, how much effort and joy goes into their jobs, and how much they care.  Kids rarely get to see the behind-the-scenes toil and sweat that goes into their schooldays.  \\"Miss Bindergarten\\" gives them that chance.  It's a peppy wonderful book with great words and a rousing story.  For a book that does so much, it's amazing that it's so little known.

Allow me to put your hearts and minds at rest when I assure you that a lack of knowledge regarding these Brooklyn 1930s sisters is not impediment towards watching their further adventures in this latest collection of rousing tales.  And while this particular offering lacks the emotion and excellent wording of other books intended for young readers, it is still a worthwhile book to take a gander at.<br /><br />The problem with the Great Depression is that it's so darn depressing.  Fortunately we have kids like Mimmy and Sophie to liven it up a bit.  In this collection of six tales, we watch our young heroines as they go about their daily New Yorkian lives.  In \\"In the Alley\\", Mimmy and her friends are indebted to Sophie when she leads them towards buried alleyway treasure.  \\"Coney Island\\" is a madcap encapsulation of what it was like to play at that legendary amusement park.  \\"Glory, Glory, Hallelujah\\", is the weakest of the batch with a convoluted story about some of the street kids playing school.  \\"At the Movies\\", plays on fears of abandonment as Mimmy and Sophie are momentarily separated during a Shirley Temple flick.  \\"Liverwurst Stockings\\", embodies the feelings spring brings about in kids absolutely everywhere.  And finally, \\"Babyland\\", shows how proving someone to be incorrect needn't be an impediment towards a great friendship.  Throughout these stories Mimmy and Sophie might bicker and nag, but they're sisters through and through.<br /><br />I found I was less impressed with these tales than I initially hoped I would be.  The stories are a bit slapdash and jerky, often difficult to understand at times.  I actually found that I had to go back and reread \\"Glory, Glory, Hallelujah\\", three times to understand what was going on in the tale.  Too often author Miriam Cohen will be telling a story in a straightforward manner, then switch the story's tone and plot in such a way that entirely knew and peculiar plot points arise.  Of course, this isn't to say that some of the stories here aren't great.  I enjoyed \\"In the Alley\\" and \\"Coney Island\\" without reservations.  As an author, Cohen starts strong but eventually ends up telling overly complex tales where simple straightforward facts would do.  Most peculiar is the fact that though this book is supposed to take place during the Depression, it's difficult to tell.  Aside from the movie playing in the theater, few direct references are made to the time period.  You don't see unemployment or much in the way of any hardship.  The girls have plenty of money to get candy, go to a movie, and take a ride or two on Coney Island.  Tis odd.<br /><br />A far better and similar book about a sisterly pair would have to be \\"Amber Was Brave, Essie Was Smart\\" by Vera B. Williams.  Like this book, the two sisters are in less than prosperous situations, but they make it through their hardship intact.  The book is the same reading level as \\"Mimmy and Sophie\\" but infinitely better written and packs a bigger emotional punch.  None of this is to say that \\"Mimmy and Sophie: All Around the Town\\" isn't worth perusing a little.  But it's only mildly well-written.  I was disappointed by the writing.  Though illustrated beautifully and containing some great tales, this isn't the first book I'd thrust in the hands of a parent anxious to read to their kids.  Better tales abound.Too often author Miriam Cohen will be telling a story in a straightforward manner, then switch the story's tone and plot in such a way that entirely knew and peculiar plot points arise.

Those wide innocent eyes.  That wide innocent mouth.  He's like Kermit the Frog in picture book form.  And though Froggy has been around some ten years plus, he's just as beloved of children today as he has ever been.  You want a good read aloud story?  Just pick up the nearest Froggy book you can find and start ah-readin'.  Like Pavolv's dog, kids are somehow programmed to react to Froggy's setbacks and mistakes with uproarious cued laughter.  The best example of this can probably be found in the lovely laughable, \\"Froggy Gets Dresssed\\".  Arguably the best in the series (\\"Froggy's First Kiss\\", has its admirers as well, I should note), the book's a great Intro to Froggydom.  And in the wintertime it's an ideal choice for your little ones.<br /><br />First of all, frogs hibernate in the winter.  This is a fact of life.  No one disputes this.  But this winter is different.  Froggy wakes up in his warm toasty bed, takes one look out the window and shrieks with delight, \\"Snow! Snow!... I want to play in the snow!\\".  Froggy's mother attempts to dissuade her little one from this course of action, pointing out that frogs are not snow-playing creatures.  Froggy remains undeterred.  He dresses hurriedly and flops outside.  Whoops!  Froggy seems to have forgotten his pants.  So he runs back inside, puts on the missing item and runs outside.  Whoops!  He's forgotten his shirt and coat.  You see where this is going.  About the time it becomes clear that Froggy has forgotten his underwear (cue the laughter of underwear obsessed kids everywhere) he's too tired to do anymore playing in snowdrifts.  And so, it's back to bed he heads.<br /><br />You want alliteration in your picture books?  Well brother, you've got alliteration.  One of the great draws in \\"Froggy Gets Dressed\\" are the sounds made as Froggy dresses.  Listen: \\"So Froggy put on his socks - zoop!  Pulled on his boots - zup!  Put on his hat - zat!  Tied on his scarf - zwit!  Tugged on his mittens - zum!\\".  It's twice as much fun to say aloud as it is to read to yourself.  But Jonathan London is only half the genius in the Froggy world.  Illustrator Frank Remkiewicz deserves just as much credit as well.  Froggy is such a likable protagonist that it's hard not to read the book over and over just to watch him as he leaps, hops, dresses, undresses, and generally has a fine ole time.  And his mother, though she tells him that frogs sleep in the winter, is mostly amused by his antics.  She carries a bemused smile on her face as he runs hither and thither in the snow, donning various articles of clothing.  Clever children may even wonder why it is that Froggy HAS all this winter clothing if he tends to sleep during the winter.  Such children should be immediately deemed geniuses and given full scholarships to Yale.  Ditto adults who say the same thing.<br /><br />All in all, it's hard to find a better upbeat winter bedtime story than dear old \\"Froggy Gets Dressed\\".  It's one of those sure-fire hits that the kids will be bound to enjoy.  A top notch bit of kiddie fare.  Recommended in spades.zwit!  Tugged on his mittens - zum!\\".

There's hip-hop of course, but either it's a little too old for your average elementary school kid in terms of subject matter or its some hokey made-for-children junk concocted by white middle class joes living in the suburbs and presented within an educational context.  Poetry itself, in its purest form, is a difficult form of writing.  There are so many bad poetry books for children out there that the good ones tend to fall between the cracks.  It is the dearest wish of my heart (right next to the dream that someday they'll come up with Godiva flavored gum) that \\"Speak To Me (And I Will Listen Between The Lines)\\" be remembered for years to come.  A funny, sad, thoughtful picture book following the musings of six urban third grade schoolchildren in the course of a day at school, the book has a voice entirely of its own.  More importantly, it fills a real gap in children's libraries everywhere.  Though you may have to introduce it to them first, once discovered \\"Speak To Me\\" should garner itself a fair hoard of fans.  If there's any justice in the world anyway.<br /><br />There's Malcolm, Brianna, Lamont, Rica, Tyrell, and Neecy.  And before you even get to the title page, you can see Malcom leaning on the top of the monkey bars on the playground wistfully contemplating the city in the poem, \\"The Playground In the Morning Before School\\".  This quiet sober reflection about a child's love of a moment of pleasant solitude artfully begins the book.  From thereon in every fear, hateful thought, desire, jealous moment, and feeling of admiration is written in the first person child's point of view.  Tyrell angrily begins his day on the wrong foot with \\"I Don't Care\\" in which he states matter-o-fact, \\"I don't care about anything this day / And you can't make me\\".  Rica thinks about her father coming to pick her up after school in the interesting, \\"My Real Daddy\\".  And Brianna, dumped as a friend by Neecy, has an angry day of thinly controlled jealousy and self-pity.  The book looks solely at how the kids feel while in school, not remarking on their home lives (apart from Rica's father) or why they act the ways they do.  More, it shows how they feel from moment to moment, making for powerful reading.  I would be amiss in not mentioning illustrator Amy June Bates' fabulous illustrations too.  Whether a kid is stretching her leg across a lunch table seat or doing some double dutch, these are realistic individual kids that you really come to care for.<br /><br />The book reminded me quite a lot of the novel, \\"Bronx Masquerade\\" by Nikki Grimes.  But unlike \\"Bronx Masquerade\\", a teen collection of poems that relies heavily on contemporary slang and phrases, this collection is somewhat timeless.  What's even most important is that the book doesn't make it seem as if these poems were actually written by the children themselves.  That frees the author up to create poems with a little more sophistication.  The poems are just stanzas that perfectly capture how certain kids feel at certain times.  You also find yourself getting wrapped up in the characters' struggles and lives.  I don't know what Tyrell's family situation is at home, but I get the feeling that it's not perfectly happy.  Similarly, I felt bad for Brianna who kept standing alone wishing that Neecy would be her friend again.  This book, more than anything else, is what a teacher sees every day.  And with many of these poems (like \\"My Real Daddy\\") you need to read between the lines to figure out what these kids are really dealing with.  It's heady fare for a picture book.<br /><br />Poetry will never be declared as popular an art form as prose.  But with the help of book like \\"Read To Me\\", I think some kids will be able to find poetry to be a way to deal with their daily lives and struggles.  It's a great book and an even greater collection.  A book that deserves greater attention.k that deserves greater attention. <br />	2005-02-06

Where other awards tell you ahead of time who the top nominations for the prize are, until the Newbery Award is announced anybody could win.  Anyone who's written an American children's book, that is.  Sometimes this yields fabulous winners that truly deserve their awards, like \\"Holes\\" by Louis Sacher (enjoyed equally by kids and adults, funny, moving, serious, ridiculous, and more).  Other times, it yields books like \\"kira-kira\\".  Ah, my poor \\"kira-kira\\".  A perfectly fine book that will now be loathed and abhorred by countless generations of schoolchildren the world over.  \\"kira-kira\\" is not bad, per say.  But it brilliantly fulfills every stereotype of Newbery Award winners.  It is depressing (sometimes ridiculously so), more of a teen novel than a book intended for children, and just the kind of story that contains lovely prose in an exceedingly boring way.  It's sad to say, but now we must officially declare the 2005 Newbery year as a bum one.  Pity.<br /><br />Born in 1951, Katie Takeshima loves one person more than anyone else in the world.  Her older sister Lynn.  Lynn and Katie are inseparable from the get-go.  Unlike those older sisters that would belittle or hurt their younger adoring siblings, Lynn makes sure that Katie comes with her everywhere.  Their family lives in Iowa and must make some big changes when they move to Georgia.  Being Japanese-Americans living in the 1950s, their parents must face terrible jobs and long hours.  Worse still, Lynn seems to be losing a lot of energy for unknown reasons.  As Katie grows and watches her beloved sister slipping away she must learn how to cope with the world on her own, bravely.<br /><br />You know you're in for a bumpy ride in a novel when, right from the start, the main character starts talking about her adored older sister in the past tense.  You know you're in even bigger trouble when she starts reading passages out of that sister's diary.  I found many similarities in this book to Adeline Yen Mah's, \\"Chinese Cinderella\\", in terms of tone and plotting.  For example, about the time Mah's main character was given a sweet fluffy yellow baby chick, you knew that chick was doomed.  Similarly, \\"kira-kira\\" lost me when, out of nowhere, a main character got trapped in a bear trap.  I mean COME ON people.  A bear trap?  Books for children usually lose me when they become depressing to the point of ridiculousness.  Bear traps are inherently ridiculous.  So too are passages in which the main character says things like, \\"I wondered if anyone else in history had ever been as sad as I was at that moment\\".<br /><br />None of this is to say that the book isn't well-written.  But there's also the fact that this book really isn't your average kiddie fare.  You have adults wearing pads in their underwear because their jobs don't allow them to use the bathroom, discussions of menstruation, and a rather adult tone to the entire book.  Prior to this award, the New York Public Library had cataloged this book as young adult.  Which, honestly, is where this belongs.  To say that this is a children's book simply because the narrator is a child is patently ridiculous.<br /><br />So teachers everywhere, educators worldwide, heed my plea on behalf of reluctant child readers.  Do NOT make them read this book in class.  Sure, some kids will discover this tale on their own and they may certainly enjoy it.  But like Cassandra I can see that many more children will someday be assigned this in school and that it will turn them off of good literature for years and years to come.  A great crime is committed by everyone who forces this tale on a young `un.  Don't be part of the problem.  If you want to hand \\"kira-kira\\" to a teen, do so.  If you wantto read it yourself, do so.  But if you want to earn yourself a great deal of scorn and rolling of the eyes, make a kid read it.  It's a fine book.  Just not worth the hype.so.

When a friend of mine, who is currently getting her education degree, expressed her deep and abiding love for Gail Carson Levine's, \\"Ella Enchanted\\", she asked me to recommend similar books.  And I, quite frankly, was completely unable to.  I think I may have suggested the tepid \\"Ordinary Princess\\", but basically I was lacking any and all supposed expertise that I, as a children's librarian, was supposed to have.  So what do you do when you like an author's work and want to find similar books?  Why you move onto that author's other books, of course!  Enter \\"The Two Princesses of Bamarre\\".  Written in the style that fans of \\"Ella Enchanted\\" have come to expect, the book is yet another cheery fantasy foray into a world of ogres, griffins, dragons, and other assorted nasty monsters.  For the girl who hasn't outgrown princesses but wants something a little more mature (and better written) than your average fairy tale, \\"The Two Princesses\\" recommends itself brilliantly.<br /><br />Once, there were two princesses.  There was Meryl, who was brave and there was Addie who was not.  In this tale, the two girls are close and constant companions.  With their mother dead and their father emotionally distant, the two must get their love from one another.  Addie lives with the constant dread that someday her sister will leave her to go throughout the kingdom slaying nasty creatures, but she hopes that day is long off.  Soon, Meryl does come across an adversary.  Just not the one either girl planned on.  Meryl contracts the deadly Gray Death, and like all its victims, is unable to defeat it.  Faced with no other choice, Addie sets out to find a cure for her sister's illness.<br /><br />The book is written in the light-hearted style familiar to Levine's fans everywhere.  It also has the required romantic subplot, as per most princess tales.  Now don't get me wrong.  The book isn't as good as \\"Ella Enchanted\\".  But it's still an engaging romp of a tale.  There is, however, a gaping plot defect in the script.  In the final moments of her sister's illness, Addie wonders if she could get her friend Rhys the sorcerer to fly Meryl to the cure.  Unfortunately, this logical plan of action is never embarked on for absolutely no other reason other than the fact that it would disturb Levine's planned plot.  It's a huge logical gap in the narrative, and not one she's usually prone to.  A disappointment, to say the least.<br /><br />Just the same, it's hard not to like \\"The Two Princesses of Bamarre\\".  Levine can write `plucky `without crossing over into `annoyingly plucky'.  Her heroines often overcome very understandable personal flaws with a great deal of wit and wisdom.  Addie isn't the best of the Levine heroines, but she's certainly one that improves greatly over the course of the story.  And though I may quibble with the plot points here and there, I think it's a fine fine book.  An amusing read for any fairy tale lover.gaping plot defect in the script.

363102:US	49148452	RLE9GOTDLSTC6	0439269695	296376752	Becoming Naomi Leon (Americas Award for Children's and Young Adult Literature. Commended)	Books	5	29	34	N	N	Don't fear, my darling.  The lion sleeps tonight.	\\"Esperanza Rising\\" was okay.  It wasn't the best book I'd ever read, nor did it leave an indelible mark on my heart and mind.  After reading it through I felt that author Pam Munoz Ryan was a fine n' dandy writer, but that it was probably unlikely that she'd produce a book that would really make me sit up and take notice.  When I start reading a children's book with a mild prejudice already established in my mind (as there was when I picked up \\"Becoming Naomi Leon\\") it takes remarkably good writing to bash that prejudice into soft mushy pulp.  And bash this book did.  By its end I was flabbergasted.  I went into this novel with the vague dread that it would read like so many other works of fiction that are ostensibly \\"good\\" for children.  I worried that it would be beautifully written and dull as day old dishwater.  Instead, it was interesting, bright, cheery, but with just enough reality and cynicism to make you feel that Naomi's fight was one worth battling out.  In short, I've been completely seduced by \\"Becoming Naomi Leon\\".  It is perhaps the underrated children's novel of 2004.  Hands down.<br /><br />Naomi begins her book with the chilling statement that she can now point out the exact moment that her sense of peace and security began to unravel like those cartoons where a dog wearing a sweater gets a string from his shirt caught in some way.  \\"Pretty soon the poor dog is bare to its skin, shivering, and all that had kept it warm is nothing more than a bedraggled string\\".  And it all began the night her mother came to town.  Naomi had been living a nice quiet life with her great-grandmother (or just Gram, as she calls her) and her little brother Owen.  Owen has a slight birth defect that affects his neck and voice, but otherwise he's pretty much a certified genius.  Both kids were abandoned years ago by their wayward mama Terri Lynn (self-renamed as Skyla), who has just as randomly swung into town to see them.  More exactly, to see Naomi.  With the firm belief that she is the rightful mother of her child (Owen's physical condition jars with her), Skyla has every intention of grabbing her daughter and dragging her to Las Vegas to take care of her boyfriend's young daughter.  Naomi's fright is understandable, but fortunately her Gram is a force to be reckoned with.  And before our heroine knows it, she's whisked away to Mexico to briefly escape her lunatic mother and to find her missing father, wherever he may be.<br /><br />Yeah, I know.  It sounds a little heavy-handed.  A mite bit unbelievable.  A smidgen over-the-top.  And with any other author, it would've been.  Other reviewers of this book have complained, ludicrously, that Skyla is portrayed as almost too evil and that no such mother like this exists.  Sure they do.  They exist all the time.  They just don't get very good press.  And Skyla is beautifully tempered as a character.  Some moments she's swimming in charm, buying her babies every pretty present she can think of.  Other times she's slapping Naomi upside the face and making thinly disguised threats against Gram.  What Ryan does to even out the more unwieldy plot elements, like these, is introduce Naomi's penchant for carving.  The daughter of a carver, Naomi carves soft soaps when she can, creating doves, lions, and squirrels.  This all comes to a head when she and her family travel to the fabulous (and very real) Oaxacan Night of the Radishes, where expert carvers converge to create large beautiful radishes into varying animal, biblical, and mythical scenes.  Adding this detail of Naomi's personality to her otherwise soft-spoken self makes her a very real and understandable heroine.<br /><br />To my mind, \\"Becoming Naomi Leon\\" whops \\"Esperanza Rising\\"'s butt.  It's a book that will have you alternately gripping your seat, reading with deep intensity, and laughing at its good humor.  Gran alone is worth the price of admission.  For a surprisingly thoughtful, intelligent, and incredibly readable book (reading this aloud to kids would work incredibly well, methinks) choose \\"Naomi Leon\\" any day of the week.  A book that promotes tolerance and wisdom.ook (reading this aloud to kids would work incredibly well, methinks) choose \\"Naomi Leon\\" any day of the week.

365785:US	49148452	R2AGLITXZ6PHVQ	038071907X	155452964	Nothing but the Truth: A Documentary Novel	Books	5	59	68	N	N	So help you God	Let's say you're a well-known children's author who wants to write a book criticizing the one-sided quick response nature of our media saturated society.  And let's say that you'd like to show this nature in the form of a boy and the Star Spangled Banner.  Now, there are two ways to go about this.  The easy way would be to write a book in which a boy refuses to sing the Star Spangled Banner in class and his silent protestation is blown out of proportion and becomes a major national scandal.  There are plenty o' books with this plot, or some mild variation.  And while they are all well-intentioned, they're not particularly original.  The more difficult method would be the one offered here by Avi.  In this book you have a boy who is supposedly punished for singing the national anthem and his self-centered approach to this punishment ruins a whole lotta lives, including his own.  Heard that story before?  You will.<br /><br />Philip Malloy is just your typical high school jerk.  He goofs around, wants to be on the track team, and generally is as normal a guy as you could wish for.  Of course, Phil's not exactly tops in his English class.  In a clash of personalities, Philip tries to be lighthearted and silly when in the presence of Miss Narwin.  Miss Narwin, on the other hand, is a truly dedicated teacher who tries as hard as she can to get her kids interested and serious in the great works of English literature.  When Philip is disruptive and silly, she reacts strongly, trying to reach him.  This all comes to a head when Miss Narwin is made Philip's homeroom teacher and asks him to remain silent (as per the school rules) during the daily playing of the Star Spangled Banner.  Philip, who cannot try out for the track team due to his poor English grades, ups the ante by singing and continues to badger Miss Narwin until he finally ends up with a suspension.  And all of this would remain in the closed sphere of a single public high school, were it not for the fact that the idea of a boy being suspended, \\"for singing the national anthem\\", is just the kind of hot topic the pundits love to play with.  In the end, no one could predict the insanity that would result from a stupid  boy just acting out.<br /><br />The danger with a book like this is that it would be all too easy to strain credulity.  I mean, the idea that America at large would get wrapped up in a debate as to whether or not a boy was \\"allowed\\" to sing the national anthem is a bit grandiose.  Then again, high school has always been the symbolic battlefield, both in art and life, where real world conflicts are played on.  Better still, Avi knows just exactly how to pull the strings on this puppy.  Why does Phil's father push him to continue to act out in class?  Because Mr. Malloy is being hounded at work and is feeling powerless personally (something he doesn't want Phil to feel).  Why does the neighbor of the Malloys take such an interest in this topic?  Because he's running for the school board and needs a hot button topic like this one to get elected.  For every burst of press this story gets, Avi has a perfectly good reason for it in his back pocket.  And I loved the characters in this story and how they reacted.  If nothing else, Avi has a wonderful feel for the weaknesses of human beings.  His villains are simply the kinds of people who hear the story they want to hear and proceed with willful ignorance, doing everything they can to avoid listening to the other side.  I loved that the man running for the school board used Phil's act as a way to say that the school didn't need to receive additional funding for new computers since they weren't even patriotic.  Beautiful.<br /><br />The book is written in an engaging style as well.  Part script, part play, the book's like a mature (and remarkably better written) version of \\"Regarding the Fountain\\" or (similarly well-written) Walter Dean Myers's, \\"Monster\\".  It's as if you're reading a collection of transcripts and recorded diary entries meticulously pieced together by an interested unknown party.  The result is a book that's as interesting to look through as it is to read.<br /><br />\\"Nothing But the Truth\\" has one last element in its favor.  It presents the number one best kicker of a last line ever put in a children or teen novel.  Read the book and see if you agree with me.  Read the book and see if you disagree with me.  For crying out loud, just read the friggin' book.  It'll a wonderful piece of subversive literature that every kid should be familiar with.

367180:US	49148452	R35IETNCKSEGUW	1881889653	658667492	Ezra Jack Keats: A Biography With Illustrations	Books	5	14	14	N	N	Much more than a snowy day	Let us all sit back for a moment and pay silent tribute to the great biographies of children's writers out there today.  Heck, let's go so far as to name them too.  Why there's \\"Ezra Jack Keats\\" by Dean Engel and Florence B. Freedman and then there's... um... well.... hm.  All right, I'll simplify the request.  Let's all sit back for a moment and pay silent tribute to the ONLY great biography of a children's writer out there (written specifically with kid readers in mind).  And that would be the aforementioned \\"Ezra Jack Keats\\".  Seeing it on the New York Public Library's list of 100 Children's Books Everyone Should Know, I felt a twinge guilty that I'd never even heard of the book before.  So I was plenty reluctant about reading it.  I mean, yes I understand the groundbreaking nature of his \\"Snowy Day\\" and I've always had an incredible respect for \\"Louie\\", \\"Goggles\\", and \\"Apt. 3\\", but let's be serious here.  How interesting could this book actually be?  We're not talking about someone who went out and climbed mountains or fought wild woolly snaggle-toothed wildebeests.  We're talking about a simple author/illustrator.  \\"Ezra Jack Keats\\" was, to my mind, going to be a long hard slog.  Instead, it was light, fascinating, sad, and inspiring.  Everything, in fact, that a good biography about such a man should be.<br /><br />Born Jack Ezra Katz in 1916, Ezra was fond of drawing right from the get-go.  He'd find any abandoned burlap or piece of wood he could get his hands on so that he could draw and paint.  His father thought this to be a waste of talent, but Ezra was good.  The book identifies those critical moments in Ezra's young life that determined what kind of person he would be.  There was the time he ran away from home and ended up getting semi-mugged by the local bullies.  The time he had a brief theological conversation with Tzadik, the local reclusive holy man.  The time he discovered the library, and the time he made a lifelong friend named Itz.  The book also looks at how he eventually grew up and became the children's illustrator he's remembered as today.  But mostly this is the formation of an artist as a young man.  The incidents within a family and a life that made him who he was.<br /><br />Now the book was written, partly, by Florence Freedman (any relation to Russell, I wonder?) who was Ezra's teacher in high school.  But I suspect the real writing credit should fall on Dean Engel herself.  In many ways, Engel has extended the average hum-drum children's book into a real work of beauty.  Take, for example, this section that discusses Ezra's newfound friendship with his scientifically minded friend Itz.  In this section Ezra would teach Itz about colors and artistic expression and Itz would teach Ezra about the science behind the beauty.  For example:  \\"He also explained how, before it dies, a lieaf stands upright on its branch for just a moment and then, with no air to support it, flutters to the ground\\".  I've picked out this sentence in the book because I feel it's absolutely lovely to read.  One of those little moments of reflection too often lacking in the soulless biographies kids are forced to read every year.  This book is different.  It dares to say something beautiful in the midst of fact fact facts.<br /><br />Some of the problems criticized by professional reviewers are a twinge off-base.  For example, the School Library Journal review pointed out that this book hasn't any endnotes.  Then again, all information that might have been placed in an Endnote section is located in the About the Author's section on the back bookflap.  And the criticism that this book hasn't a bibliography is just downright wrong.  There is a bibliography of Keats' written and illustrated books.  Just not the ones he drew for other people.  The criticism given by Booklist that the random illustrations paired with moments in Keats' life don't always match up is somewhat correct.  Still, it isn't particularly distracting and many times works particularly well.<br /><br />\\"Ezra Jack Keats\\" the biography is faboo.  It's well-written, has a great subject to examine, and belongs on every child's reading list.  In the course of following a single man it covers history, art, and the course of a life.

I like to keep a fresh mind open and to come across a book without any expectations or any plot points given away.  But in the case of \\"Felita\\", I made an exception.  I read that the book was all about a girl's move from her predominantly Puerto Rican neighborhood into a \\"better\\" German/Irish neighborhood and the strife that occurs there.  And yes, that is part of the book.  But what's remarkable about \\"Felita\\" is that its more an examination of separate events in Felita's life than a single one that defines her.  Her confrontation with racism is, in some ways, just as important as her ways of dealing with the death of her beloved abuelita.  This book is one to be taken as a whole.  Not glorifying a single plot point.<br /><br />In the course of a year, Felita has a lot to deal with.  First there's her family's move to a neighborhood that will provide good schools for Felita and her brothers.  When the neighbors turn out to be prejudiced and not afraid to make their threats physical, the family is forced to move back to their old area at a bit of a loss.  Then there's the fire that burns down poor Old Bernie's candy shop.  Felita also has to deal with her supposed best friend stealing of the lead in the school play out from under everyone's nose.  Fortunately, Felita's grandmother, Abuelita, is there to listen to everything her granddaughter has to say and to offer advice.  But when Abuelita becomes ill, it's Felita who must find the courage to continue on.<br /><br />The book's an excellent follow-up to the slightly similar, \\"My Name is Maria Isabel\\".  Both books involve Puerto Rican girls dealing with the problems and prejudices of the adults around them.  But \\"Maria Isabel\\" is a much younger reader while \\"Felita\\" is the perfect reading level for fourth to fifth graders.  When I read it, I was initially shocked at the degree of hatred leveled at Felita's family after their move.  The book was written in 1979, so it's debatable whether or not you'd find this level of prejudice in any large urban city with a significant Latin American community.  Certainly you might find some small growls, but nothing like the concentrated effort on the part of the people found here anymore.  One review of this book posed the worry that maybe the children reading this book would automatically dislike Germans and Irish because of their actions here.  This is, to say the least, unlikely.  At no point does Felita point to her neighbors and say, \\"I hate those Irish and those Germans!\\".  It's mentioned that that's who originally populated the area.  Nothing more.<br /><br />The book is an interesting series of vignettes in the life of a single girl.  And it reads as beautifully today as it did in the late 70s.  The writing is clear, crisp, and easy to understand.  Children will definitely agree with Felita on everything from her anger at her nasty neighbors to her hurt feelings when her best friend doesn't even tell her she wants the lead in the school play.  Mohr sticks with clear cut emotions and matter-of-fact situations.  It's a fun book with a catchy plot and interesting characters.  A good read all around..

There are many good books about coming to America from war torn countries but many more so-so books on the same topic.  In the case of \\"Tangled Threads\\" by Pegi Deitz Shea, the book had the job of being interesting, informative, and (most difficult of all) genuinely touching.  And it does, to some extent.  As other reviewers of this book have mentioned, some of the Hmong words in this tale are misspelled and it's debatable whether or not this accurately depicts the Hmong-American teen experience.  But Shea has written a truly interesting book, one that deftly balances the heaviness of its subject with lighter more hopeful feelings.  It is not a book for small children or those kids who are reluctant readers, but it's a good book all the same.  A boon to the world of Hmong-centric children's literature.<br /><br />Having basically grown up in the dirt and squalor of a Thai refugee camp, Mai has spent her existence learning the art of pa'ndau, or storycloth from her grandmother.  Her dream has always been to join her uncle, aunt, and cousins in America.  Now, with her stomach ailments growing worse and the refugee camps threatening to close, grandmother and granddaughter are able to leave their homeland behind and travel across the ocean to Providence, Rhode Island.  Mai expects that all her problems will be gone once she reaches that magical land.  Instead, she finds worlds, both outside and insider her home, difficult to navigate.  Her grandmother is reticent and displeased with everything new in America.  Her uncle and cousins are constantly at war with one another over boundaries and choices.  And Mai herself must learn about handling money, dealing with a new language and life, and her increasing annoyance with her grandmother.  It isn't until Mai learns a horrible secret that's been kept from her, however, that she can start to come to terms with what it means to be Hmong in America.<br /><br />At first the book struck me as slightly similar to \\"A Step From Heaven\\" by An Na.  The immigrant experience of one girl in America, dealing with patriarchal figures that demand total obedience, holding onto traditions, etc.  But where \\"A Step From Heaven\\" is mostly about the problems within a broken family, \\"Tangled Threads\\" is more about the search for identity after a recent immigration.  Now I need to be perfectly clear here and state that this is not a book for younger children.  Heck, the protagonist only barely escapes a rape attempt in the first 38 pages.  Consider this a title for older readers, especially those with an interest in people from various cultures around the world<br /><br />Now I can't attest the accuracy of the events portrayed in this book.  But certainly author Shea has done her homework.  She even includes a detailed afterword, glossary, pronunciation guide to Hmong names, list of Thai words, definition of Hmong symbols, and (most interesting to me) a wonderfully complete bibliography of any and all Hmong children's books and websites for further reading.  As for the story itself, it's okay.  This isn't the most unique book I've ever read in my life.  The story's rather basic and a twinge predictable.  But it makes for good reading all the same.  This is a title that gives a strong look at a little known culture living in the United States.

Consider this a title for older readers, especially those with an interest in people from various cultures around the world       Now I can't attest the accuracy of the events portrayed in this book.  But certainly author Shea has done her homework.  She even includes a detailed afterword, glossary, pronunciation guide to Hmong names, list of Thai words, definition of Hmong symbols, and (most interesting to me) a wonderfully complete bibliography of any and all Hmong children's books and websites for further reading.  As for the story itself, it's okay.  This isn't the most unique book I've ever read in my life.  The story's rather basic and a twinge predictable.  But it makes for good reading all the same.  This is a title that gives a strong look at a little known culture living in the United States.  I only wish every group of immigrants to America had at least one book about their people that was half as good as this one.  A strong showing.	2005-01-29

Hamilton was an extraordinary writer, creating complex fantastical books for children that seamlessly integrated contemporary interesting situations with aspects of African-American culture.  Heck, one of the first ways I learned about the Underground Railroad was through her \\"House of Dies Drear\\".  I hadn't read her collection of black folktales entitled \\"The People Could Fly\\" though I intended to.  I was a little confused, therefore, when a brand spanking new \\"The People Could Fly\\" was published in 2004.  I soon learned, though, that the book had taken one of the stories from the original collection, in a beautiful retelling of the amazing title story.  This is a book that is beautiful to look at and a joy to read and reread.<br /><br />For you see, they say the people could fly.  Long ago in Africa there lived people who had beautiful bright black wings and who could soar in the sky.  When they were captured by white slavers, the people shed their wings in the tight confines of the slave ships and forgot how to soar.  They were sent to work in the field under the whips of the \\"masters\\" and overseers.  One day, a woman and her babe were suffering too much to go on much longer.  With the ancient words of the old man Toby, the woman and the babe remember how to fly and soared away from the farm.  The story recounts how the people who knew how to fly learned to do so again with the help of old Toby and how the slaves who did not know how to fly watched them escape and retold the story to their children just as this book tells it to you.<br /><br />It's a lovely story, all the lovelier due to the illustrations of Leo and Diane Dillon.  The Dillons have illustrated the covers and books of Ms. Hamilton for years, so it is not surprising that they should do so again here.  I've always been a huge fan of the Dillons, and this latest effort of theirs is as beautiful as anyone could hope.  Even its endpapers are gorgeous, all matt black with shimmery feathers floating down the pages.  What \\"The People Could Fly\\" does best is introduce children to the concept of slavery within the context of a folktale.  Through this story kids understand the horrors of enslavement, rejoice in the escape of some, and understand that most slaves remained trapped and unable to fly.  What really set this book apart for me, though, was the use of Editor and Author's Notes.  Some great picture books (such as \\"Ellington Was Not a Street\\") are beautiful and interesting but never set their story within any context and leave you feeling very confused.  \\"The People Could Fly\\", on the other hand, tells you everything you need to know about Hamilton, the origins of this tale, the various interpretations of flight (and how you can find a similar idea in Toni Morrison's excellent \\"Song of Solomon\\"), and the degradation of slavery.<br /><br />All intelligent dialogue aside, this book is just a great read to kids.  It'll capture their attention with the beautiful pictures, and the words will give them the additional thrill of wondering what it would be like to fly with wings.  It's written with slightly older children in mind.  Those kids who still like picture books but may want something a little more sophisticated than your average \\"Horton Hears a Who\\".  With all the folktales out there, it's sometimes difficult to find African-American tales that aren't ALL based on Brer Rabbit.  Fortunately, we now have this story to read to all the children we can find.

371829:US	49148452	R3VPK2N83X2M5O	1587172011	703516223	Noah's Ark (Caldecott Honor Book)	Books	3	25	44	N	N	Many waters	Now it seems to me that if you're the kind of person who goes around deciding to write a whole new picture book about the story of Noah's ark, you have two choices before you.  You can try to reinterpret the classic tale in a new, amusing, or artistic way.  \\"Noah's Ark\\" by Peter Spier (which won a Caldecott) falls into this category.  It's a funny, wordless, different look at the story.  The other way is to be epic, bold, and (to be frank) humorless.  And in this camp we find Jerry Pinkney's, \\"Noah's Ark\\".  Telling the story of Noah word for word without any digressions or spots of flamboyant creativity, this book is a straightforward encapsulation of the story we all know so very very well.  It's a lovely work and certainly a pleasure to page through but it's gosh darn earnest.  A book that takes itself a little too seriously.<br /><br />I guess I could sum up the story of Noah's ark here, but you probably are familiar with the text.  If not, it goes like this:  People bad, Noah good.  God tells Noah to go and build an arky arky.  Animals come two by two, world floods, world unfloods, animals disembark.  Noah good, rainbows good, the end.  The book doesn't say which version of the Bible Pinkney got the words for this book from, but it's very clear that he's staying very close to the original text.  This is a matter-of-fact story.  Fortunately, Pinkney livens it up some with his customary style.  The animals are all over this book, from blue-faced baboons to the delicate soaring butterflies.  Pinkney even begins the book with a reiteration of \\"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth\\", complete with animals swimming, flying, and lurking.  This fades beautifully into the subsequent story.  Then, at the end of the book, you see the Earth dotted with beautiful rainbows as the text explains how the cycles of the globe, \\"shall never cease as long as the earth endures\\".  Wraps the book up nicely, it does.<br /><br />But for the man who brought the world the eclectic and incredibly original \\"Sam and the Tigers\\", it seems odd to be that he'd show the Noah story in such an old-fashioned light.  Here, Noah and his family are white people in robes.  The ark (a spectacular image of the ark's frame alone makes the book worth paging through) is exactly as it always appears in books and paintings.  There's  nothing in this book that makes the story particularly ... well.... human.  It's serious business going on here.  Serious epic rebirth-of-humanity type stuff.  But would it have killed him to have placed a visual gag somewhere?  Told a line with more punch and less sobriety?<br /><br />I guess I should never have looked at the Peter Spier book before coming to this one.  That was my problem.  Don't get me wrong... this book is truly lovely.  And if you want a matter-of-fact retelling of Noah, there's no better place to look than here.  But if you have a sense of humor, a penchant for pairing the beautiful with the jolly, and a love of new ways of looking at old stories, do not come to Jerry Pinkney.  Come to Peter Spier instead.  Mr. Pinkney has written a variety of interesting new picture books with important lessons.

If someone were to walk up to you, place a gun to your head, and demand that you tell them the name of at least one really great Swedish children's book illustrator, how would you fare?  What if it was a banana they held to your head?  A mild sedative?  Well, thanks to \\"Wallace's Lists\\" you need never fear this potentially dangerous/messy/sleepy scenario again.  It is illustrated by the uniquely talented Olof Landstrom, and written by the delightful Barbara Bottner and Gerald Kruglik making it one of those rare Swedish/Florida crossovers that's so hip with the kids these days.  The book points out the potential pitfalls that come when a person plans out their life a little too well and fails to allow for any variety or excitement.  And though this lesson might be better suited for a fifty-year-old, within the context of the book it works rather beautifully for little children.<br /><br />Wallace has it all figured out.  Whatever it is he wishes to do with his day, he first makes a list.  Wallace is a bit of a list addict.  He has lists of his favorite stories and pets and weather and all sorts of stuff.  He even has a huge book of them all collected together.  One day a new fellow moves in next to our hero.  The new guy, Albert, is far more adventurous than Wallace, and suggests that the two of them take a trip to Glockamorra.  When Wallace sleeps in and Albert takes this non appearance as a sign that he's not interested in the trip, Albert leaves on his own.  What Albert doesn't know is that a dangerous storm is on its way.  Wallace must warn him before it's too late.  Even if that means not adhering to lists.<br /><br />I was deeply glad that this book didn't turn out to be a kind of odd couple/Ernie & Bert tale done in picture book form with mice.  The story of the uptight stick in the mud and the crazy frat guy has been done to death in children's literature.  What sets \\"Wallace's Lists\\" apart from these is the fact that the book isn't saying that what Wallace does (making lists) is a bad or stupid thing to do.  It's just saying that a person should be a little flexible once in a while and that if your guard is down sometimes, lovely things can happen to you.  I also liked that Albert never mocked Wallace at any point.  When Wallace points out that he may not want to go to Glockamorra because List #8 says he hates rain streaming down his glasses, sand in his shoe, being hot, being cold, being wet, and being lost, Albert simply says, \\"Hmmm. It is quite possible that at least one of those things might happen if you went to Glockamorra\\".  This is a subdued response, pairing perfectly with the serene illustration of Albert calmly hanging a picture he's painted over the huge gaping hole he created moments ago in his wall.<br /><br />In fact, the illustrations in this book are delightful.  They have a somewhat European feel to them, with Wallace in his flat blue hat and square glasses.  At first the book looks as if the pictures in it are simply cartoonish drawings lacking in form and function.  Then you get to an absolutely ripping two-page spread of rain drenching the nearby airport and you gain a new respect for Mr. Landstrom's work.<br /><br />The best recommendation I can give this is to say that it features the kind of friendship you'd find in Arnold Lobel's, \\"Frog and Toad\\" books.  Just two good friends having a fun time and learning a little in the process.  A book that will leave you with a good feeling after you've finished it.lace does (making lists) is a bad or stupid thing to do.

Sibert Informational Book Honor (Awards))	Books	5	20	20	N	N	Language is key	Well, it had to happen sometime.  I knew it was just a matter of time before I found that I could no longer distinguish between amazingly well-written non-fiction picture books and adult non-fiction works of literature.  It all came to a head when I sat down to read James Rumford's remarkable, \\"Sequoyah\\".  A winner of the Sibert Honor, the book is a intelligent examination of the Cherokee metalworker who gave his people their own written language.  Reading it, I found myself intensely interested in the book's subject and his amazing accomplishment of creating an entirely new written form.  But I became depressed when I reached the end.  Suddenly I wanted more information.  More!  I wanted to know what became of the Cherokee writing and what its state is today.  It took an embarrassingly long time before I stopped blaming Rumford for being so paltry with his facts and remembered that I was not, in fact, reading an in-depth history but a remarkably interesting picture book.  So ladies and gentlemen of the vast Internet universe, I can think of no higher praise to give this book than this:  It makes grown adults forget what they're reading, so interesting is the material.<br /><br />Rumford begins on a personal note.  One year, as a child, his father brought him and his family to visit the great sequoia trees of California.  And the man for whom these magnificent trees are named?  A leader of his people though, as Rumford's father would say, \\"but not as you may think?\\".  Thus begins the history of Sequoyah.  The son of a Cherokee woman and a white father he worked as a metalworker and, at the age of fifty, decided to capture his people's voices before they were wiped out by the whites.  This intention was not initially appreciated by the Cherokees who may have feared that he was adopting a European trait.  After some initial mishaps, Sequoyah decided to produce a syllabary based writing system.  Utilizing eighty-four letters he taught his six-year-old daughter Ayoka to read.  Slowly, his new system caught on until in 1824 the Cherokee Nation gave Sequoyah a silver metal.  The book ends with a full syllabary accompanied with some background information for those who would like to know more about the live and history of the Cherokee language and its creator.<br /><br />James Rumford gave the world the incredibly intricate and fascinating Chadian picture book, \\"The Calabash Cat\\", containing a story written in both English and Arabic.  Rumford does something similar in \\"Sequoyah\\" by printing the text both in English and, this time, in the Cherokee language.  It's a remarkably beautiful language visually, and here it is translated by Anna Sixkiller Huckaby who is the training coordinator at the Cherokee Nation Cultural Resource Center.  The illustrations in the book are immensely beautiful, especially within the context of the story.  Rarely are dedications of picture books illustrated.  Here, they are.  And it improves the story.  The illustrations here are inspired by the Navajo works of Quincy Tahoma, the Chinese artist He Jiaying, and the Japanese woodcut master Hiroshige.  As a result, they look like woodcuts but feel more personal than anything so rough-cut.  I especially loved looking at the sequoia trees at the beginning, with the tiny family silhouetted below.  The people are just tiny black figures, poised against a magnificent majestic work of nature.  Then you come to the story and become fully enmeshed in a single man's dream and success.<br /><br />Stories of true heroes are difficult to come by.  Too often the people we were supposed to praise in our youth (Columbus, Andrew Jackson, Reagan, etc.) turn out, in the light of history, to have been truly awful guys.  Not men like Sequoyah, though.  A true hero who accomplished a single remarkably difficult act for a noble cause, he is a hero we should all know and love.  And \\"Sequoyah\\" by James Rumford, is the perfect vehicle to do so.  I cannot praise this book highly enough.ighly enough. <br />	2005-01-25

Unlike many of the other collections in the series, \\"Season\\", contained a unprecedented amount of Mr. Sandman as protagonist.  The odd thing about this graphic novel series is that the hero really doesn't show up all that often.  In \\"Season\\", he was all over the place.  Now, with \\"A Game of You\\", it's as if Neil Gaiman recognized just how much Sandman there was in the last one and is working as hard as possible to never let it happen again.  Though \\"A Game of You\\" is perhaps one of the best written collections in the series, it is a little lacking in the protagonist department.  And somehow, that's okay.<br /><br />Remember Barbie?  The crazy apartment neighbor of Rose Walker who lived with her supposedly perfect boyfriend Ken in \\"The Doll's House\\"?  Well she's back and all is not well.  Barbie and Ken split up long ago and she's currently living alone in New York City without much purpose in her life.  She has a good drag queen friend, some nice lesbians upstairs, a quiet girl named Thessaly (if you get the reference here then you're too well educated to read this graphic novel), and a kinda creepy fellow named George.  Not much happens to Barbie, which is okay with her.  I mean, she used to have these far out wacky dreams about being the ruler of an enchanted kingdom that was constantly under attack by something called the Cuckoo.  But it's been a long time since Barbie's dreamed.  And then, one day, one of her dream companions comes looking for her.  Though Barbie may have left her dreams, it's clear that her dreams have not left her.<br /><br />The standard line repeated regarding \\"The Sandman\\" is that it's one of the rare graphic novels that girls read just as often as boys.  I never entirely understood why this was before.  I mean, sure, the hero of the tales is cute in a kind of gothic way.  Girls who go gaga over Robert Smith of The Cure would probably also go for this guy.  Ditto Edward Scissorhands.  But \\"A Game of You\\" shows the other aspects of the series that appeal.  In this particular tale, for example, a witch and her two lesbian companions go off to save their friend while a transvestite guards a body and saves a homeless woman.  There's a lot of moon rites, sex-ed talk, and confrontation of bigotry in this tale.  The ending is nice and complex as well.  It takes some appropriate pot shots at small-mindedness and the evil of daily ignorance as well.  I also appreciated that the book wasn't just some big girls-who-look-like-Barbie-are-people-too deal.<br /><br />What I really want to convey is that this book is really well written.  It still has the basic horrific elements that, for reasons that remain unclear, are part of the series.  So don't be shocked by the dead face nailed to the wall with its similarly nailed eyeballs and tongue.  But it transcends this silliness.  It's mostly just a story about interacting with other people and how the choices we make about our own lives affect the people around us (however unintentionally).  And it has some kick-ass illustrations.<br /><br />I think this is one of the rare Sandman Chronicles that you could read all by itself without having had read any others in the series.

Intrigued by this I tried to seek out children's books that spoke about the Somalian experience and that would be useful to our library collection.  I guess I wasn't too shocked to find that there wasn't an abundance of books on the subject, but I was a bit disappointed.  Then, in the course of my work, I heard about Mary Hoffman's, \\"The Color of Home\\".  A beautiful picture book written by the author of the supremely popular, \\"Amazing Grace\\", I was both relieved and delighted to find the story exactly what I was hoping for.  Better still, \\"The Color of Home\\" speaks to any child that has ever left a violent country and moved to America.  Combining the slow acceptance of the new and different with an understanding of how talking about things can be therapeutic, this is one of those rare deeply moving picture books.<br /><br />Hassan is unhappy.  Having left bright colorful warm Somalia for cold colorless unfamiliar America depresses him.  Though his teacher and fellow students are nice enough, Hassan has to deal with language differences and his own personal history.  One day, his teacher asks him to draw a picture.  He does, but fills it with the images of the blood and violence he left behind.  Through the intervention of a friendly translator and talking about what he's been through, Hassan starts to feel a little better about his experiences.  Slowly, he learns to adjust.<br /><br />Yeah.  It's a tearjerker.  Mary Hoffman, aided by illustrator Karin Littlewood, kinda goes for your throat with this one.  The moment it really got me was when Hassan talks about having to leave his cat behind.  You see him, one moment, crouching under the bed as the boots of a soldier pass by, his hand clasping the cat to his chest in fear.  The next he's leaving, reaching for the cat that's standing all alone while the family leaves.  But this is not to say that the story panders with cheap emotions.  If nothing else, Hoffman is entirely respectful of her subject.  It's true that the book ends on a happier note.  The family is now filling their house with color and Hassan is learning some new words and feeling better about everything.  But it's obviously not a perfect situation.  Just a better one.<br /><br />The illustrations are lovely as well.  Using broad watercolors, Littlewood draws realistic characters with bright cheerful colors.  She's also rather good at drawing Hassan's personal paintings.  They're childlike but also, at times, horrific.  Combined with Hoffman's words, this book, as I said before, speaks to all kinds of children.  Not just the one's escaping from brutality.  It doesn't matter what your child's situation is.  \\"The Color of Home\\" is one of those books that should be read to them so as to open their eyes to the world around them.

But then, not many children's books are \\"Miss Hickory\\".  The 1947 Newbery winner, \\"Miss Hickory\\" belongs strictly to that amazingly popular genre of what-mischief-do-our-dolls-get-up-to-when-we're-not-around books.  Only in this case, the doll is not one of your fancy china creations or a Victorian lady but rather a New England creature of humble origins.  She has the body of an applewood twig and the head of a hickory nut.  And that's just the beginning of the peculiarities found in this (sometimes) little read tale.  If you want a Newbery winner that appeals to those kids that like dolls, nature, or a little bit of both then you're in for a surprising treat.<br /><br />Meet Miss Hickory.  A small doll living out her days in a corncob house, she has a happy little existence keeping to herself and not bothering anyone.  When her gossipy Crow friend informs her that the family with whom she often spends her winters indoors is leaving the countryside without her, Miss Hickory is loathe to believe it.  Further confirmation on the part of the cat Mr. T. Willard-Brown finally forces her to face up to the facts, whereupon she swiftly plunges into a deep pit of woe and self-pity.  Fortunately for her, Crow finds Miss Hickory a warm nest of a shelter in which she can live out the cold winter months and because of this she is able to interact sociably with the other animals that live in the area.  There's the peacable doe who's mother is killed and who hooks up with a wild heifer.  There's a naughty squirrel who keeps eyeing Miss Hickory's noggin as a potential food source... but only jokingly, right?  There's the downtrodden hen-pheasant (described in the cast of characters as \\"sad and without pep\\") who gets pushed around by her husband.  And there's a groundhog who's unnatural fear of his own shadow causes a great deal of ruckus.  By the end of the tale, Miss Hickory learns a little about her own personal flaws and transforms herself into an entirely different entity so as to better serve the children that return to the farmhouse.<br /><br />Unlike a previous Newbery winning doll book character (Hitty from \\"Hitty: Her First One Hundred Years\\"), Miss Hickory is not your standard oh-me-oh-my heroine.  Because her head is so hard she often finds herself being mean, stubborn, or unyielding to things that might cause her a lot of pleasure if she let them.  This flaw in her personality is remedied in a somewhat drastic way that I, frankly, really enjoyed.  This book is also full of little odd turns of phrase that catch the reader's ear.  When the squirrel takes his first look at a newly dandied up Miss Hickory, his immediate reaction is a kind of macho, \\"Hi, cutie!\\".  And when Miss Hickory views the lead crow of a mob she thinks to herself, \\"Undoubtedly a gangster.... He ought to be shot, but they'll never catch him\\".  I'm a fan of the unexpppected bit of fun in older children's books and this particular story has unexpected fun hither and thither.<br /><br />There are some odd choices in the book, though.  This story has a blatent Christian Christmas miracle scene that may make not make much sense to those child readers not raised on Christmas Eve tales since birth.  And the whole hen-pheasant being dutiful to her awful husband is a bit dated today.  One suspects a kid reading such sections would wonder why the brow beaten hen doesn't just leave her husband and stay with the other lady hen-pheasants instead.  It's worth wondering.  Still, the book overcomes this dated features and continues to be a good tale.<br /><br />Though this is probably not one of the better remembered Newbery Award winning books (more's the pity for it), \\"Miss Hickory\\" is well worth reading.

The Hardy Boys, after all, were still popular and the degree of introspection most young men in today's fiction are apt to was significantly less.  Not so the hero of Betsy Byars's, \\"The Midnight Fox\\".  A small unassuming but still interesting book from the last 60s, the tale is of an unathletic average boy, his summer spent on a farm in the country, and his chance encounters with a mysterious woodland creature.  There is no magic.  No mystical occurrences or significant coincidences.  Just ordinary people acting and reacting to one another and the appearance of the animal that divides them.<br /><br />Tom is under the distinct impression that animals of all sorts, regardless of species or family, hate him.  And this is just one of the myriad of reasons Tom does not want to stay on his Aunt Millie and Uncle Fred's farm.  He'll be far away from his best friend, alone with family members he hardly knows, and he'll probably get loaded down with chores.  Still, Tom's parents are adamant, so it's off to the farm for a couple months he goes.  Of course, nothing is as bad as he had anticipated.  His relatives are sweethearts, his chores miniscule and his best friend is writing him regularly.  As for animals, Tom meets one that becomes his summer fixation.  Living on the acres of land surrounding the farm is a rare and beautiful black fox with a single cub.  Intrigued by this elusive creature, the boy discovers her lair and protects her secret.  But when the fox angers the family by making off with a few chickens, Tom has to figure out exactly what to do to save his new friend from people with excellent fox-tracking skills.<br /><br />Confession time: This is the first Betsy Byars book I've ever read.  I know her name is often synonymous with great children's writers everywhere.  And I know that not having read, \\"The Summer of the Swans\\" yet I'm probably going to earn the pity of children's librarians everywhere.  But honestly I didn't know what to expect from her as an author.  What I found, to my delight, was a writer who's not afraid to use humor while tapping into childhood fears.  Tom's remarkable in some ways because he's just an average guy.  He can't swim, can't run very fast, and isn't a fan of sports particularly.  His best friend Petie (who conjures up fake headlines like, \\"BOY FALLS DOWN BANK WHILE GIRL ONLOOKERS CHEER\\", to describe his everyday experiences) is just as interesting as Tom and provides a lot of comic relief in this tale.  But best of all, this book tapped into one of my favorite kiddie lit conventions.  It didn't include a villain.  Oh, it includes adults doing thoughtless acts without realizing how they affect the children around them, sure.  But no one here is a bad guy.  And no one here ends up as the evil nefarious fox hunter or anything like that.  If there had been someone like that in this book, it probably would've tipped this book dangerously into the world of melodrama.  Oog.  Fortunately, this is not the case and \\"Midnight Fox\\" just strikes the reader as a good well-written piece o' work.<br /><br />Now, if you know a kid who's into foxes and the like, this isn't a bad book to hand them.  Fortunately, a love of those animals is not a requirement.  This is just a good read for anyone.  Boys and girls alike.  It has an exciting conclusion, some spots of beautiful writing, and likable characters.  It will charm any and all comers, regardless of age.the Swans\\" yet I'm probably going to earn the pity of children's librarians everywhere.

Call me limited, if you will, but I just feel more comfortable in the realm of books intended for an audience under the age of 19.  Which makes my review of \\"Valentine and Orson\\" just that much more difficult.  Written and illustrated by wonderful Quaker writer Nancy Ekholm Burkert, the book is a clever retelling of a lost romantic French play.  Inspired by the master painter Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Burkert has crafted a book that is not really meant for children but appears in a distinctly picture bookish format.  I say that it isn't intended for kids, but when read aloud, this story is appropriate for people of all ages.  And it's thoroughly engaging to boot.<br /><br />Our narrator is Pacolet, presented in this form as a Muslim dwarf.  Before our eyes a troupe of actors appears and places a stage in the midst of a small village.  They are presenting the exciting pantomime of Valentine and Orson in \\"nine momentous acts\\".  In a plot worthy of Shakespeare himself (or, rather, reminiscent of) we meet Alexander, Emperor of Greece and his lovely wife Bellisant.  When the Emperor's lascivious Archbishop makes a move on the lovely lady she shuns him, earning his wrath.  A few well placed accusations on his part regarding that lady's faithfulness to her husband's bed is all this is needed to get her banished to the wilderness with a single servant to accompany her.  Worse still, she's pregnant.  And so, alone and in the wilderness, Bellisant gives birth to twins.  One child (Orson) is stolen by a bear and raised to be a wild man.  The other (Valentine) is found by the Emperor's brother-in-law and raised as a boy of the court.  When Valentine is sent to kill Orson because of public complaints, he makes an amazing discovery and with his brother sets out to discover their true lineage.<br /><br />You like stories of romance, adventure, big honkin' giants, and magic?  Well brother, this one's for you.  According to her Author's Note, Burkert based her rendition of this tale via Henry Watson's translation of a French prose version.  Inspired by Chaucer's \\"Canterbury Tales\\", Burkert decided to make her job  that much harder by (shudder) putting the story into, I kid you not, iambic pentameter couplets.  In words of great restraint she notes, \\"It has been a lengthy and daunting process\\".  Color me unsurprised.  The result, however, is flawless.  Not a beat of this puppy reads as anything but harmonious to the ear of the 21st century reader.<br /><br />In fact, the book is so successful in terms of language that it almost seems a waste to illustrate it.  I said almost.  The fact of the matter is that Burkert's art is extraordinary.  In the book, \\"The Art of Nancy Ekholm Burkert\\" (a recommendation of her work right there) one writer notes that her paintings are, \\"as highly ordered and rooted in traditional craftsmanship and discipline as any classically trained Renaissance artist\\".  I have heard from highly reputable and Friendly sources too that the twins in this book portraying Valentine and Orson bear a stunning resemblance to the author/illustrator's own son.  The illustrations amount to more than a happy family drama, though.  With each picture we see a play being performed for simple country folk.  Common objects are used for everything from swords to the wild man's beard.  And just as the audience forgets that they're watching a play as they become drawn into the action, we too forget that we are watching an illustrator portray actors IN a play.  The action is just as interesting to the real reader as it is to the imaginary audience.  Quite a feat.<br /><br />I wouldn't immediately suggest that you hand this book to the nearest toddler for their bedtime reading, of course.  On the other hand, there are some kids out there (older readers generally) who love Shakespeare.  So if you're hoping to give them something both beautiful and interesting, \\"Valentine and Orson\\" may just work.  It makes a lovely gift and is a pleasure to present to one's own friends.  All that and it's well-written too.  A rare of work of picture book art.  Take the greatest of care with it.n\\" may just work.

If you've ever read her books about that famous bunny Max or classic titles like, \\"Morris' Disappearing Bag\\" then you know that her stories, while disjointed, can often be truly charming works of preschool art.  So when I discovered the McDuff books (written by her but illustrated by someone else entirely) I was ill at ease.  I mean, Wells draws such cute little bunnies.  How could anyone else adapt to her words?  On reading the first book of the McDuff series, \\"McDuff Moves In\\", I was amazed to find myself suddenly on the oposte side of the fence.  The pictures in this book are really quite charming.  From the cute little Scottie named McDuff to the 1950s setting, visually this story's a charmer.  But strange as it may seem, Wells's words are out-of-place here.  Though a brief tale with little in the way of plot, somehow this book is not as direct or understandable as it might be.  A pity.<br /><br />On our first view of little white McDuff, he's sitting in the back of a city pound truck.  After a providential bump in the road and a quick escape, the solitary doggy goes down a nice suburban street in search of food and shelter.  Door number one at the first house growls at him.  Door number two at the second house hisses at him.  But door number three at the third house is just right.  There, a friendly couple take him in, feed him, give him a bath, then decide they haven't room for a doggy.  Fortunately an attempted car ride to the pound proves that maybe this couple has grown a bit attached to their shaggy new friend.  Happy ending and shortbread biscuits for all.<br /><br />The book bears a striking resemblance to Lyn Rossiter McFarland's subsequent similarly plotted picture book, \\"Widget\\".  The difference, however, is that \\"Widget\\" is the stronger story.  Though I was with \\"McDuff\\" through the beginning, about the time he stumbles on the kindly couple I found my eyebrows slowly beginning to lift.  For example, when McDuff appears outside the third home, the book says the following: \\"Somebody opened the door and asked him to come in.  It was Lucy. 'This is Fred', said Lucy\\".  Looking at the picture of both Fred and Lucy staring at the pup on their porch, I naturally assumed that now the dog was named Fred.  Not so much.  The text and the pictures don't mesh particularly well either.  When the book says that Fred checks McDuff's collar, the picture shows Fred sitting on a chair with McDuff hiding underneath.  Plus the language is oddly stilted.  It ends with the words, \\" 'How happy we are!', they said in their dreams\\", which is half an inch shy of hokey and a sneeze away from outright saccharine.  I don't think I'm conveying the book's inability to tell its story convincingly to you.  Nevertheless, I strongly urge you to flip through this story long before you decide to buy it.  Long before.<br /><br />Which is not to say that the pictures don't almost make up for its narrative flaws.  Illustrator Susan Jeffers has a Caldecott Honor Award under her belt and it shows.  From Lucy's painted toenails and felt hat spotted bathrobe to the image of the three new friends happily munching on McDuff's shortbread biscuits at the tale's end, this book seeks to enchant.  Seeks and, were it not for the words, would succeed.  I loved the fabulous 40s-50s decor.  I liked the scared little McDuff turning into a confident happy pup in a loving home.  I liked how realistic these images were and how original the setting became.  Obviously if Rosemary Wells had illustrated this tale herself she would've done it in an entirely different way.  It's just her own bloody good luck that she found herself paired with such a supremely talented artist.<br /><br />So it's entirely up to you.  \\"McDuff Moves In\\" has much in its favor and much against it as well.  Personally, I suggest that if you are looking for a tale of a cute little white Scottie finding a home then you should seek out \\"Widget\\" by Lyn Rossiter McFarland forthwith.  If, however, you're a fan of the period picture book genre and you like Susan Jeffers's work, \\"McDuff\\" may be a great choice for you and yours.  It is not Rosemary Wells's best writing and the story is pretty touch n' go.  Still, there are things to recommend it.  Definitely give it a trial run.forthwith.

All you have to do is look at the bad guys and the good guys. Now, are the good guys good all the time and never deviate from their holy quest? And are the bad guys bad at all times and never show even the slightest human emotion or small moment of of conscience or pity? Well congratulations! You are currently reading a bad book! and it doesn't matter if the book you are reading is intended for a five-year-old or a fifty-year-old. If characters appear in perfect black and white at any and all times then the author of the work is not a mature enough writer to give their characters any depth or ambiguity. I mean heck, even \\"Harry Potter\\" has the deliciously maybe-he's-bad-maybe-he's-good Severus Snape. Which brings us in the most roundabout way possible to Nina Bawden's 1973 classic, \\"Carrie's War\\". A delicate deeply interesting book that remains basically forgotten today, Bawden's best-known work is still as good a read now as it was way back in the early 70s. Ya gotta respect that kind of staying power.<br /><br />It's the middle of the Second World War and Carrie and Nick are on a train to the deep depths of Wales itself with a load of other schoolchildren. Their father is a Captain in the war and their mother a volunteer ambulance driver so it's just the two kids making their way northward. Once there, they're taken in by a kindly, if skittish, older woman and her domineering older brother. They also make the acquaintance of a mysterious lady who lives in a dark hollow called Druid's Bottom. There the woman lives with her simple companion and the elderly woman she tends. In their new home, Carrie finds herself sympathizing with Mr. Evans, her rough guardian, while Nick leans more towards Mr. Evan's sister, Auntie Lou. Yet when Carrie is caught in the middle of an unpleasant family drama, she takes an action that she will regret for decades and decades, only to be remedied, at last, by her own children.<br /><br />The only other work of fiction that comes to mind when I think of plots centered on kids sent to the English countryside during World War II is, \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\". Not bad company to be in. \\"Carrie's War\\" is a bit subtler than your average work of kiddie lit, though. For one thing it dares to think about the background of its \\"villain\\". Mr. Evans is your typical storybook ghoul in many ways. He's a bully, a cheapskate, and the unquestioned lord of his little roost. His sister quails under his leadership and the children are, at first anyway, deathly afraid of him. Over time, however, Carrie learns a little more about Mr. Evans' history and what made him the way he is. If he's cruel or sharp it has much to do with what he lost when he was young. Even when she attempts to confront him as a villain she's struck by his small kindnesses and acts of generosity. Sure, he can be awful. But who isn't awful once in a while?<br /><br />Other clever writing techniques employed by Ms. Bawden include her choice of beginning the book with an older Carrie lamenting an action she made years and years before. There's even a hint that she may find a romantic interest with an old friend, though nothing explicit is said. And on top of all of that, the writing in this tale is top notch. Really lovely stuff. Bawden gives us a realistic view of adult relations through the eys of a child while never sacrificing plot, motivation, or believable interactions.

It clogs the senses, rendering otherwise intelligent reasonable adults into a state of cloying admiration for children's books that have no redeeming characteristics.  I suspect that's why people still read/enjoy books like that gawdawful, \\"Abraham Lincoln\\" by Ingri and Edgar Parin d'Aulaire, \\"Betsy Tacy\\" by Maud Hart Lovelace, and \\"Prayer For a Child\\" by Rachel Field.  Giving an askance glance to the cover of \\"The Rooster Crows\\"... well let's just say that my hopes were not high.  It was originally published in 1945 and its cover (at least the edition I was perusing) contained apple-cheeked Campbell Soup logo-type children flouncing and bouncing about.  I'm not a particular fan of apple-cheeked youngsters in general, but this initial reaction turned out to be a classic example of why one should never judge a book by its cover.  True, the collection does suffer from that 1945 view that the only \\"Americans\\" worth putting in a picture book were white and Protestant, but if you overlook this small stupidity you'll find a really nice collection of poems with quite pleasant pictures.  An enjoyable way to introduce kids to some basic rhymes that everyone should know.<br /><br />The book's a topsy-turvy collection of those poems all good little children are required to at least have an inkling about.  You've got your Yankee Doodle, your Roses Are Red, and your Ring Around the Rosies.  On the other hand, more obscure titles do tend to surface.  Ever heard of Quaker Quaker How Is Thee?  Or better yet, I'm Going to Lady Washington's?  The book has an odd attachment to those poems that refer to people during the Revolutionary War.  This is probably because they are supposed to be quintessentially \\"American\\".  Still, you'll not find the Civil War or the War of 1812 much remarked on here.  The poems are separated into the following categories:  Rhymes and Jingles, Finger Games (with helpful drawings of hands for those who don't know the movements), Rope Skipping Rhymes, Counting-Out Rhymes, Games, and (for reasons left somewhat unclear) Yankee Doodle.  Yankee Doodle gets a full three page treatment, rife with battle scenes, our first President on a noble steed, and a nice little chorus for the kiddies.  It's odd, but it's there.<br /><br />The illustrations in the books are, as I said, whitey white white.  They're also more interesting on closer inspection than you might expect.  For example, the poem of How Much Wood Could a Woodchuck Chuck is accompanied by a small woodchuck in high waisted pants, suspenders, and a nice button up white shirt.  I don't know what mental image I always attached to this poem, but after having seen the picture presented here I know exactly what I'll be seeing from now on.  There, in his bloomers, the woodchuck has his arm back and is obviously about to hurl a significant hunk of wood as far as his woodchucky muscles can throw.  It's a surprisingly amusing picture, especially since the woodchuck has been drawn (in his body anyway) realistically and has the a look of calm animal concentration on his furry face.  Other pictures in the book are all well and good, but this is the one that won my heart.  A book that contains a wood hurling forest creature has my admiration and respect any day of the week.<br /><br />This is, by the way, an excellent resource for any teacher, librarian, or parent who wants a go-to source for classic children's poetry.  Its poems are just as good today as they have ever been and even the form of the book aids educators who want a book to cover the basics.

Sometimes you really want to gush about a beautiful picture book, but you find yourself admitting that while the illustrations are eye-droppingly good, the story is less than thrilling.  And as a result you really find yourself lauding the illustrator and paying scant attention to the author.  Now I was worried that this would be the case with \\"Hondo and Fabian\\".  It's a remarkably simple story told with illustrations that tap dance on the line between \\"picture book\\" and \\"art\\".  Had this been written by one person and illustrated by another I would've sobbed and paid lip service to the author while secretly wishing the illustrator would reap all the profits.  Fortunately, Peter McCarty is the sole genius behind this 2003 Caldecott Honor winner.  So all praises flow naturally to him.<br /><br />In this tale we meet a dog and a cat that share a home.  The dog is Hondo and the cat Fabian.  On this particular day Hondo is off to have an adventure while Fabian stays at home.  While out, Hondo rides in a car, meets up with a friend on the beach, dives into waves, and comes home.  At home, Fabian sits about, plays with the \\"baby\\" (a spunky toddler that I suspect may bear more than a passing resemblance to the author's own daughter), escapes from the \\"baby\\", and plays with a roll of toilet paper.  At the end of the day they come home to one another and go right to sleep.  Two happy pets in a happy home.<br /><br />The back bookflap of this story contains pictures of the real Hondo and Fabian.  Readers shouldn't find themselves surprised then when they feel an odd astonishment at how ... well... less round the real animals are.  The illustrations in this book are nothing short (and I do not use this term lightly) of magical.  Soft lighting, rounded features, and beautiful pastel colors of the deepest reds, grays, browns, and blues fill this palette.  Both Hondo and Fabian look so doggone furry and lovable that it's all you can do to keep from hugging the book tightly to your chest.  The publication page says that McCarty used pencil on watercolor paper to get these pictures.  I, for one, have a hard time believing it.  Colored pencils have never been so breathtaking.  So luminous.  Gush gush gush.<br /><br />So I'm a fan.  Obviously.  It's hard to think of a living soul on this planet who wouldn't be.  If you'd like a storytime book with very simple words, cute animals, and realistic situations (I loved how the child held the cat) then \\"Hondo and Fabian\\" is a brilliant choice.  It falls into the category of books destined to be remembered for years to come.  One of the most deserving of Caldecott Honor winners.this palette.

Starring that child.  Meet author/illustrator Peter Sis.  An artist whose works have extended from the poster for the movie \\"Amadeus\\" to the recent breathtaking oh-my-goodness-how-did-he-make-all-those-dots \\"Tree of Life\\", Sis is a master of detail and complexity.  Yet in \\"Fire Truck\\" he makes a 180 degree turn in the opposite direction.  Where his past works would make Seurat himself envious of their painstaking detail (emphasis on the pain), \\"Fire Truck\\" is an experiment in clean lines and utter simplicity.  It has a beautiful Eastern European flavor to it and simple words and pictures that kids will be drawn to.<br /><br />One there was a boy named Matt who loved fire trucks.  As the book progresses we see just how much Matt adores his trucks.  They are, we are told, the first words he says in the morning and the last words he says at night.  One day, Matt wakes up and lo and behold he has merged into his very own fire truck.  The book counts off all the items that are a part of Matt and prove his new fire trucky status.  One driver, four flashing lights, nine axes, etc.  He saves animals, puts out fires, and rescues falling teddy bears.  And when pancakes are filling the air with their scent he parks the truck at the table and (now a boy once more) sits himself down to eat.<br /><br />Simple stuff.  If you're looking for a long in-depth treatise on the inner working of fire trucks, look elsewhere.  Here you will find the barest bones of the story.  There are approximately three colors in this book altogether.  You've got your blue, your brown, and (of course) your red.  With white and black as the lines and spaces, of course.  But the story is excellent.  What fire truck obsessed kid wouldn't want to suddenly wake up one day and find they'd merged with their favorite vehicle?  The pages of the book are thick and difficult to tear, making them excellent for either very small children or kids learning to read on their own.  There is a two-page pullout of Matt as a long lovely fire truck that might get a little bent or squished over time.  Then again, the copy of the book I read was taken from my local public library and the pages were in used but unripped condition.  Take that as you may.<br /><br />If you are looking for anything and everything regarding fire trucks to appease your cantankerous little one a) Try to turn them on to dinosaurs instead and b) Failing that go out and get them a copy of Peter Sis's \\"Fire Truck\\".  It may be one of his lesser known works, but it shows his great range and is a sure-fire hit with the kiddies.  An excellent selection.with their favorite vehicle?

All you have to do is look at the bad guys and the good guys.  Now, are the good guys good all the time and never deviate from their holy quest?  And are the bad guys bad at all times and never show even the slightest human emotion or small moment of of conscience or pity?  Well congratulations!  You are currently reading a bad book!  and it doesn't matter if the book you are reading is intended for a five-year-old or a fifty-year-old.  If characters appear in perfect black and white at any and all times then the author of the work is not a mature enough writer to give their characters any depth or ambiguity.  I mean heck, even \\"Harry Potter\\" has the deliciously maybe-he's-bad-maybe-he's-good Severus Snape.  Which brings us in the most roundabout way possible to Nina Bawden's 1973 classic, \\"Carrie's War\\".  A delicate deeply interesting book that remains basically forgotten today, Bawden's best-known work is still as good a read now as it was way back in the early 70s.  Ya gotta respect that kind of staying power.<br /><br />It's the middle of the Second World War and Carrie and Nick are on a train to the deep depths of Wales itself with a load of other schoolchildren.  Their father is a Captain in the war and their mother a volunteer ambulance driver so it's just the two kids making their way northward.  Once there, they're taken in by a kindly, if skittish, older woman and her domineering older brother.  They also make the acquaintance of a mysterious lady who lives in a dark hollow called Druid's Bottom.  There the woman lives with her simple companion and the elderly woman she tends.  In their new home, Carrie finds herself sympathizing with Mr. Evans, her rough guardian, while Nick leans more towards Mr. Evan's sister, Auntie Lou.  Yet when Carrie is caught in the middle of an unpleasant family drama, she takes an action that she will regret for decades and decades, only to be remedied, at last, by her own children.<br /><br />The only other work of fiction that comes to mind when I think of plots centered on kids sent to the English countryside during World War II is, \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\".  Not bad company to be in.  \\"Carrie's War\\" is a bit subtler than your average work of kiddie lit, though.  For one thing it dares to think about the background of its \\"villain\\".  Mr. Evans is your typical storybook ghoul in many ways.  He's a bully, a cheapskate, and the unquestioned lord of his little roost.  His sister quails under his leadership and the children are, at first anyway, deathly afraid of him.  Over time, however, Carrie learns a little more about Mr. Evans' history and what made him the way he is.  If he's cruel or sharp it has much to do with what he lost when he was young.  Even when she attempts to confront him as a villain she's struck by his small kindnesses and acts of generosity.  Sure, he can be awful.  But who isn't awful once in a while?<br /><br />Other clever writing techniques employed by Ms. Bawden include her choice of beginning the book with an older Carrie lamenting an action she made years and years before.  There's even a hint that she may find a romantic interest with an old friend, though nothing explicit is said.  And on top of all of that, the writing in this tale is top notch.  Really lovely stuff.  Bawden gives us a realistic view of adult relations through the eys of a child while never sacrificing plot, motivation, or believable interactions.  As an example of just being a wonderfully written book, \\"Carrie's War\\" takes the cake.  A great tale that deserves to be remembered.for decades and decades, only to be remedied, at last, by her own children. <br /> <br />The only other work of fiction that comes to mind when I think of plots centered on kids sent to the English countryside during World War II is, \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\".

388967:US	49148452	R3D65M7XPWCSU7	0385326610	900651055	Dangerous Games	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Lord Herodsfoot, I presume.	I make a point of not reading the plot synopsis of a book before I read the book itself.  When you pick up a novel and read the back or inside cover of it you might discover things that the author would really rather you find out within the context of the story and not via a fifty-word synopsis.  So I didn't read the synopsis of \\"Dangerous Games\\" until after I read the book.  Under normal circumstances, this rarely causes any problems.  In this case, however, I discovered that I had unknowingly read this book out of order.  You see, \\"Dangerous Games\\" is one of the books in the \\"Wolves Chronicles\\", which began with \\"The Wolves of Willoughby Chase\\".  And Dido Twite, the heroine of this tale, began in those books.  Not knowing this, I read this story without any idea that it was a sequel or continuing saga of some sort.  And you know what?  It didn't matter.  \\"Dangerous Games\\" is so fast-paced, amusing, and intelligent that you needn't read any of its predecessors to appreciate it fully.  Part \\"Treasure Island\\" part \\"Below the Root\\", the story is a comment on colonialism and how conquering a land does no good to either the conquerors or the conquered.<br /><br />It may seem like a wild goose chase, but Dido Twite has been hunting down a ridiculously difficult prey for quite some time and thus far has had no luck.  When the British King Jamie comes down with a cold (he's just a kid, you know), he insists that the only thing that will save him are some new and interesting games brought via Lord Herodsfoot.  Herodsfoot studies games and his latest finds have taken him to the mysterious island of Aratu.  Now Dido must find the man and bring him back to England, but not before she comes to know the lay of the land a little better.  In Aratu you have native forest dwellers, called the Dilendi, and the colonizing Angrians.  Once arrived, Dido finds herself caught in a war between a king and his brother, befriending a lost princess, speaking with ghosts, avoiding sting monkeys, creating rain itself, and all in all having a really grand adventure.<br /><br />The book says some absolutely lovely things about the innate ridiculousness that comes when Europeans found colonies on already existing native populations.  In this case, the Angrians settled on Aratu and began destroying the forest for further plantations.  When the Dilendi cursed the Angrians with a deep abiding homesickness for their native lands, the population either emigrated or became peculiar.  As a result, the remaining Europeans are a sorry crew.  True, they control much of the island by force, but internally they've responded by oppressing their women, establishing rigid class systems, and generally disapproving of any and all fun.  They're like puritans without the whimsy.<br /><br />Aiken does a find job of never relegating a person to a distinct personality simply due to their skin color.  I find it interesting that other reviewers of this book have accused it of racism when no one is a certain way solely because of their genetics.  You've good Angrians and bad Angrians and good Dilendi and bad Dilendi.  The villain of this tale is an Angrian who best represents all the failings that come with willful ignorance.  The hero of this tale, Dido, is a wonderful London scamp with a Cockney accent and a penchant for pants.  Her companion, Dr. Talisman starts as male and then turns out to be a wonderfully strong female character for whom you never worry one moment.  As for the upper class twit Lord Herodsfoot, I found myself more than once wishing that someone would give the guy a swift kick in the butt once in a while.  He's the perpetual schlemiel of the story.  If there's a cliff to be accidentally fallen over or a poison to eat, you can bet who'll be the one doing the falling and eating.<br /><br />Mostly, however, the book's real lure is its adventure.  And I daresay that this is one of those rare adventure tales boys will read EVEN THOUGH the hero of the tale is, essentially, feminine.  If your young male reader doesn't take to Dido then you may count them out as lost causes.  She's such a wonderful character that it would take pounds of prejudice to keep from devouring her every word and action.  I stumbled across \\"Dangerous Games\\" entirely by accident, but I'm truly glad that I did.  It's a fine piece of work and a tale that, in spite of its series status, stands alone beautifully.

There is much to be said in praise of any book that revolves around a giant rampaging chicken.  It's one of those images that sticks so nicely in the brain.  In the case of \\"Looking For Bobowicz\\", this is just the latest in author Daniel Pinkwater's poultry chronicles (the first being, \\"The Hoboken Chicken Emergency\\", of course).  In this tale you may meet delightfully eccentric adults, sane reasonable children, a mysterious phantom, and the memory of a chicken who rocked a town with its flutter.<br /><br />To his chagrin, Nick (real name Ivan Itch) has moved from comfortable Happy Valley to uncomfortable urban Hoboken, New Jersey.  Nick is not pleased with the move (his mother didn't want him growing up with bad suburban influences) but quickly finds some like-minded pals living next door to his new home.  He also gets his bike stolen by a mysterious phantom.  Before he knows it, he and his friends Loretta and Bruno are rushing to the library to solve the mystery of the phantom and to get back what once was theirs.<br /><br />In a lot of ways, this book definitely harkens back to Avi's, \\"No More Magic\\".  Same reading level.  Same mysterious being stealing the main character's bike right at the start of the story.  Same otherworldly feel to the tale and peculiar kids banding together to solve the crime.  And like Avi's book there's a slightly disjointed feel to the narrative.  This isn't to say I didn't enjoy the book, though.  I mean, a book has won my instant admiration if it contains, at some point, a father telling his son (who is going to try to capture a bat), \\"if you should get bitten, tell me at once so I can arrange for the series of painful shots\\".  And there was much to enjoy in the tale as well.  What kid can't relate to the wonders of exploring a basement full to brimming with mysterious junk?  Or reading comic books (of literary classics, no less) while munching on sandwiches and Dreamsicles?  Or following a series of clues to a mysterious cave deep below the earth?<br /><br />There were definitely some odd choices in the story though.  The mom of Nick often remarks on the wonderful influences of the big city on kids, which I assumed was a play on those mothers who think that way about the suburbs.  The book doesn't dwell much on details and has some of the shortest chapters I've ever encountered.  Also, adults' actions are left somewhat mysterious without reason.  And there are some definite inconsistencies between the text and the pictures drawn by Jill Pinkwater.  Little niggling things like the books saying the chicken was riding on a tricycle when it is CLEARLY riding a two-wheeled bike.  But these are tiny matters.  In the end the real question is whether or not this book successfully enthralls.  And the answer is yes.  Yes indeed it does.<br /><br />So if you are looking for a work of fiction that is a little older reading than your average \\"Cam Jansen\\", but you don't want to hand your children something as complex and high-handed as \\"His Dark Materials\\", \\"Looking For Bobowicz\\" is an excellent alternative.  For any kid that loves his or her average chicken mystery, this one takes the cake.  It's sly, inventive, and cocky.

Take, for example, \\"Wild About Books\\" by Judy Sierra.  This is an author who's greatest hit thus far was a penguin book entitled, \\"Antarctic Antics\\".  The illustrator of this book, Marc Brown, is perhaps the better known of the two due to his hit book series (and subsequent tv show) \\"Arthur\\".  Still, even taking \\"Arthur\\" into account, it isn't as if a book touched by the magic hand of Mr. Brown is guaranteed instant Top Ten on the New York Times Bestseller list status.  Yet for weeks on end, that is exactly where this particular puppy has steadfastly remained.  There is something about \\"Wild About Books\\" that speaks to people.  I'm not sure if it's the Seussian wordplay, the literary name-dropping, or the moral of the story (i.e. read books) but this work has touched something deep in a great many American consumers.  As it is, the book is a fine read.  No, it's not going to blow you away with its wit and wisdom.  The pictures, while fine, are not breathtaking.  The rhymes scan nicely but aren't particularly new.  I liked the book, no question.  I'm just a little baffled by its success.<br /><br />In this tale we hear about a bookmobile librarian by the name of Molly McGrew who, on one bright and beautiful day, accidentally drove her portable library into the zoo.  Not the least bit disturbed by her mistake, Molly lures the animals into her facilities with loud eclectic readings of Dr. Seuss (to which this author owes more than a small debt of thanks).  The animals, thus lured and apparently literate as well, find that the bookmobile is stocked with just the kinds of books that appeal to them.  The beavers read, \\"How to Build Dams\\" (wouldn't they already know?), the crocodiles read \\"Peter Pan\\", and the giraffes read books on skyscrapers, basketball players, and redwood trees.  Over time, Molly teaches the animals proper book etiquette.  And so enamored are they of their books that they start writing them as well.  There's a wonderful section in which a scorpion critic critiques various insect haikus it finds (my favorite being, \\"A cannibal twig, Silently devours a leaf - Eating, not eaten\\" to which the critic replies, \\"Pretentious\\").  Some even make entire books and, in the ultimate act of a truly civilized society, build a library of their own.  And so, the author warns, if you are searching for animals at the zoo and don't see them, never fear.  \\"They are snug in their niches, their nests, and their nooks, going wild, simply wild, about wonderful books\\".<br /><br />I'm waiting for a snobby reviewer to note that in a passage that clearly states that the llamas were reading dramas, the accompanying picture displays two such beasts reading, \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" and another reading \\"Candide\\", neither of which are technically considered dramas.  I could be that reviewer, but I really liked that section.  Heck, a thorough rereading of this book has given me a clearer appreciation of its construction as well.  The scorpion haiku section is inspired and will actually serve to teach kids difficult-to-define terms like, \\"Pretentious\\" and \\"Redundant\\".  I was also rather delighted that the librarian in this book is not your stereotypical bun/shhing finger/thick black glasses marm we've seen in so many tales before.  This gal is spunky and vibrant.  Molly wears pink pants with orange and yellow striped jackets (and some pretty kickin' black boots as well).  She gleefully stomps down those old-timey images of librarians as fuddy-duddies.<br /><br />There's a lot of name-dropping that goes on in this book, you know.  For example, \\"Harry Potter\\", \\"The Cat In the Hat\\", and \\"Nancy Drew\\" all get quoted by name while subtler plays and tales like \\"The Iceman Cometh\\" (penned by a penguin, of course), \\"Uncle Vanya\\", and \\"Goodnight Moon\\" show up visually.  Actually, it's fair to say that Brown's visual gags far outweigh the book's written ones.  Of course, the illustrations in this story are a bit simplistic.  They're colorful and inventive when it comes to books and various animals' reading preferences.  I also liked (and this is entirely a personal preference so bear with me) that when Sierra mentions an animal, Brown makes sure to draw it.  Therefore, a section that mentions, \\"a mink and a moose, a wombat, an oryx, a lemur, a lynx, eight elephant calves, and a family of skinks\\", really shows every single one of those animals!  And, by extension, kids can learn what skinks and oryxes look like.  So now you have a book that's scientific, great with the rhymes, and about the joys of reading.  What's not to like?<br /><br />Of course, the only reason I'm not giving this book five stars is because while it's fun to go through and enjoyable to give to one's children, it's drawings aren't particularly beautiful, it's writing a pale knock-off of Dr. Seuss, and its storyline fun but not all that original.  And yet I'm delighted and wowed by the reception it's received.  If you're wondering if you can ever trust the New York Times Bestseller list again after \\"Walter the Farting Dog\\" stayed on it for so very long, definitely consider this a return to form.

To a child, tall tales are totally and entirely distinct from lies.  When you ask a kid what happened at school and they launch into an interesting if implausible tale of bandits, pirates, and space aliens you are not expected to punish them for their creativity.  Such a mindset is needed when reading \\"Olivia Saves the Circus\\" by Ian Falconer.  The sequel to the highly charming if somewhat bizarre \\"Olivia\\", this book follows the familiar little pig as she invents a tale of derring-do and breathtaking wonder.  Kids love Olivia because she has adventures (if only in her own mind) that they would like to have.  Adults love her because her books are witty, urbane, and pleasant to the eye.  And I love them because they're funny.  This book in particular is a highly amusing story that, if it doesn't make you giggle, will at least raise the hint of a smile on your face.  Few pig-related picture books do as much.<br /><br />If you've ever met Olivia before then you know what to expect from her.  She lives with her mom, dad, and two little brothers in (what we can only assume to be) New York City.  A striking individual, Olivia excels at perking up her drab school uniform with an excessive amount of red accessories.  This particular day at school, each child is to tell the class about his or her vacation.  Through the eyes of our heroine we hear how the local circus was in town but, tragically, all the performers were sick with ear infections and could not perform.  Luckily for them, Olivia was up to the challenge of fulfilling every available position.  Before our very eyes she's a tattooed lady (with the aid of some magic marker), a lion tamer, a tight-rope walker, a juggler, a clown, a trapeze artist, and so much more.  \\"And that's how I saved the circus.  And now I am famous\\".  The teacher, unsurprisingly, isn't buying.  A cross-examination of Olivia comes up with the following dialogue: \\"Was that true?\\". \\"Pretty true\\". \\"All true?\\". \\"Pretty all true\\". \\"Are you sure, Olivia?\\". \\"To the best of my recollection\\".

(Horn Book Fanfare List (Awards))	Books	5	34	37	N	N	I dream of sheepy with the light green wool	Have you ever noticed that many of the best picture books for children aged zero to five tend to involve sheep?  Why is this?  What is it about sheep that make them ideal receptacles of authorial wit and wisdom?  Is it their woolly coats?  Their sly sweet faces?  Their remarkably loud baas?  Whatever the case, I've had the pleasure of reading smartly written sheep books that vary from \\"Sheep In a Jeep\\" by Nancy Shaw to this more recent Mem Fox creation, \\"Where is the Green Sheep\\".  Helped in no small part by newcomer Judy Horacek, the book is a deft examination of various sheeplike and unsheeplike activities.  It's a surprisingly charming and winning little book that's certain to earn the undivided love and attention of ankle biters worldwide.<br /><br />Using remarkably simple words, the book follows various sheep through their day.  We see sheep of many colors and sheep taking baths.  We have sheep up and we have sheep down.  There are band sheep, wind sheep, near and far sheep.  Just about any kind of sheep you can think of, this book's got `em.  Still, one question keeps popping up throughout the pages.  Where is the green sheep?  By the end, we discover the mysterious green sheep's location and exactly what it is doing.  It's an oddly satisfying way to end the tale and so we do.<br /><br />Mem Fox incites an odd following of rabid pro-Fox fans everywhere.  People cannot get enough of this woman.  I've never completely fallen under the Fox spell myself, but with this book I'm beginning to see her charms.  Though the story would be far less interesting if it was not accompanied by Judy Horacek's illustrations (more on that later), it's still a bouncy flouncy flurry of fun.  In fact after all the crazy sheep antics there are two blank pages containing these words at the story's close.  \\"What IS that green sheep?  Turn the page quietly - let's take a peep...\\".  And then you see the book's namesake, \\"fast asleep\\" under a lovely green bush.  The whole book rhymes beautifully, scanning perfectly on every page.  So to finish with this sweet quiet ending... well it does the heart good.<br /><br />But the real star of this show is Judy Horacek.  An Australian who's bookflap merely refers to her credits as having, \\"written and illustrate(d) books of her own\\", she has burst onto the children's publishing scene with a whiz and a bang.  Her style is best summarized as deceptively simple.  In truth, it mostly consists of sheep, scenes, and actions drawn with a black Rotring Isograph pen and colored in with various shaded and colorful watercolors.  This sounds dull.  It is not.  Horacek's sheep have somehow been imbued with remarkable jolts of personality and joy.  Whether you're watching the antics of the rain sheep dancing about a lamppost or the car sheep fixing its engine, something about these animals is bloody fascinating.  But the moment in the book where these wooly stars really got me was the section that discusses near and far.  You turn the page and find yourself nose to furry nose with a sheep viewing you intently.  The two little black spots that make up its eyes bore into yours.  And on the next page is a far sheep.  Possibly as small as Horacek's thick tipped pen could draw.  It doesn't matter what these lollygagging lambs are doing.  Every step they take is spellbinding.<br /><br />So there you have it.  A great book for children that are just beginning to read.  And trust me, a predilection towards sheep is not required to enjoy this book.  It's just one of those rare tales that adults will enjoy reading over and over and over and that kids will find equally enjoyable that many times.  It's not one of those grand works of preschool literature, but it's a great book.  Just give it a glance.  As sheep books go, it's a keeper indeed.ymes beautifully, scanning perfectly on every page.

It's one of those constants on which we can all rely.  No matter what goes on in the world, whether it be floods, famines, or the everyday trials of ordinary life, one thing is for certain.  As long as there are children and as long as books about dinosaurs exist, the two will be perpetually and inexplicably linked.  Now I've actually not read that many really interesting dinosaur books in my day.  There's the obligatory, \\"How Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight?\\", by Jane Yolen and (of course) \\"Dinotopia\\", but for all the enjoyment these scaly reptiles engender, there are relatively few well-written preschool aged books about them.  Enter \\"Dinosaur Roar!\\", stage right.  The books admittedly fails to do some of the basic dinosaur book duties.  It does not name each and every terrible lizard with its Latin moniker.  Just the same, the book is a good early introduction into the world of reading.  Kids interested in it will find themselves immersed in a dinosaur laden universe that fulfills all their dino-related needs.  And adults will not be bored.  Nuff said.<br /><br />\\"Dinosaur Roar!\\" is best described as a book of dino opposites.  In it, we see one dino doing one thing and a very different dino doing another.  It begins with \\"Dinosaur roar, dinosaur squeak\\" and continues on another two pages with \\"dinosaur fierce, dinosaur meek\\".  Different reptiles react in different ways.  On some pages, sharp toothed gleeful fellows attempt to munch on their neighbors while on others, sweet faced tiny creatures flee, scurry, to do whatsoever the words on the page say.  In the end, it all culminates with several pages worth of dinosaurs eating their favorite foods.  The herbivores nosh on trees and leafy greens while the carnivores (for the sake of keeping the rating of this book a sweet G) gnaw on large white tendon-less bones as if they were just oversized dogs. The book shows a vast variety of different dinosaur species without skimping.  It's an enjoyable thing to page through.  Of course, the fact that none of these dinos are ever named really is a problem.  If a child points to a picture of a feathered dinosaur and asks the parent what the name of it is, that adult may find themselves stumbling (was it aperdyterix or apordacturux or...?).  \\"How Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight?\\", solved this problem by surreptitiously placing the names of each and every animal somewhere on the page that featured them, giving both adults AND their children a good scientific lesson.  \\"Dinosaur Roar!\\"?  Not so much.<br /><br />Still, the pictures are pleasant to the eye.  Paul Stickland uses a massive array of incredibly colorful watercolors to their greatest advantage here.  Though the pictures do contain some elements of cartoons, they're also really lovely to look at.  You have mucky greens, sly peach/purple/blues, pastels of pink and navy, and well-scaled oranges.  Now the meateaters are a scary crew, true.  But kids love that kind of stuff.  As long as a book isn't showing a dinosaur literally tearing another one of its fellows into a bloody pulp then kids love the threat the massive t-rexes and velociraptors engender.<br /><br />In the end, I probably would still recommend, \\"How Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight?\\" over \\"Dinosaur Roar!\\", but there's no reason in the world why you shouldn't take a good long look at the both of them.  For most parents, even the most sloppily written piece of trash starts to look good as long as it contains a dino or two.  Here, we have a well-written book with amazing artwork and a great use of rhyming words.  There's little to dislike about this book and a whole lot to love.

Commended)	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Glass menagerie	I'll cut a book a whole swath of slack of it's beautifully illustrated.  I'm not ashamed to admit it either.  A story could be pedantic, repetitive, and dull and I'd still be gaga over it if the pictures were pretty enough.  Now in the case of Campbell Geeslin's, \\"Elena's Serenade\\", I'm torn.  The tale told here is actually rather interesting and well-written.  Its heroine sets out on a kind of small picaresque quest and gains her heart's desire by the end.  Now certainly the story is not the best written in the world.  It drops certain plot points here and fails to offer any reason for other occurrences there.  But it's a nice enough tale and when you take into consideration the overwhelming beauty of artist Ana Juan's illustrations.... well let's just say it's enough to salve over any nit-picking I might have.  \\"Elena's Serenade\\" is beautiful and affecting without straining to please.  If you don't love it, I can think of a hundred small schoolchildren who would.<br /><br />Told in the first person, we see the world of Mexico through little Elena's eyes.  The daughter of a glassblower, Elena's one dream is to someday learn the trade.  Unfortunately, female glassblowers are entirely unheard of at this time and, anyway, Elena is too little.  At the advice of her brother our heroine decides to disguise herself as a boy and travel all the way to Monterrey to study with the world's best glassblowers.  Along the way she plays funny tunes on her glassblowing pipe and helps out a burro, a roadrunner, and a lovesick off-tune coyote.  In Monterrey, Elena displays her new glassblowing via music technique.  Suddenly she's creating stars with five points, butterflies that clink their delicate glass wings, and huge magnificent birds, one of which takes her back home.  At the end of all her journeys, Elena is pleased to show her new talents to her papa and to play delightful tunes with colorful images from the tip of her glassblowing pipe.<br /><br />Obviously the story has some rough spots.  After all, why does Elena help out the animals of the desert if their trials have nothing to do with the story at large?  What time period is this in which girls cannot be glassblowers?  Sure looks like present day to me.  And the magical source of Elena's power is left unclear, though I'm willing to chalk that up to magical realism and just leave it at that.  These problems could have sunk a book with an illustrator less talented than Ana Juan.  As it is, it's clear to me that author Campbell Geeslin lucked out.  Juan first hit the children's picture book scene with a jaw-droppingly beautiful encapsulation of Frida Kahlo's life entitled, \\"Frida\\" (by Jonah Winter).  She follows that success up with the equally magnificent \\"Elena's Serenade\\", and I couldn't be more pleased.  Elena is the perfect heroine.  Comically ridiculous when she attaches half a tortilla to her face to look like a beard.  Incredibly pitiable when she hunches over in pouty misery after her father tells her that her dreams are impossible.  Each page in this book is filled with luminous rounded images.  From the glass butterflies that soar through the air to the moon's face as she lovingly listens to the coyote's song.  Juan is also particularly good at lighting.  The scenes beside the glassblower furnaces are my personal favorites.  I loved how the artist was able to meld together the faces of the Monterrey artists as they stare in wonderment at Elena's fabulous glowing orange glass star.  If you would like to be blown away by a book's pictures for a little while, consider being blown away by this one.<br /><br />There is no getting around the fact that there are not enough picture books in the United States that celebrate aspects of Mexican life.  This is one of the few and I for one will be recommending it to every child I come across for the next fiftysome years.  It's not the best writing in the world but it may well have the biggest heart.  For a perfectly marvelous and beautiful story, consider trying your hand on the magnificent, \\"Elena's Serenade\\".  It'll make you and your children happy.and beautiful story, consider trying your hand on the magnificent, \\"Elena's Serenade\\".  It'll make you and your children happy.	2005-01-08
396250:US	49148452	RJTPEPKSSAGFV	0575029609	652235027	The Seventh Raven	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Nevermore	Everybody get some pen and paper and take your seats.  Now at this time I am going to ask you to write down a list of book titles that meet a certain criteria.  These titles MUST be considered to be written for children or for young adults.  Ready?  Let's begin.  First, write down all the books you can think of that contain hostage situations similar to that of the Iranian Embassy situation.  Now write down all the books in which a multi-faceted view is given of freedom fighters in South American countries?  One more... name all the books that contain a nuanced understanding of America's ties to the Contras and give damning critiques of the Reagan administration.  Pencils down.  How many books did you come up with?  You may have been able to think of a couple here and there.  Undoubtedly a few hostage books came to mind (like \\"Give a Boy a Gun\\") and you were able to include them.  Now, look at your lists and give me the names of the books that contained ALL these interesting situations.  Do any of them fit?  If not, may I direct your attention to a little known number that goes by the title of, \\"The Seventh Raven\\".  It was written by the British author Peter Dickinson and published in America in 1981.  What's more, if you haven't read it you are, in fact, missing the boat.  It's a wonderfully humorous but also chilling look at the complacency of the middle class bourgeois and the inhumanity of violence, regardless of who uses it for whatever ends.  And it's also about opera!  Hooray!<br /><br />I'll explain.  Our heroine in this tale is the multitalented little nabob, Doll.  Doll belongs to an upper middle class community of British music enthusiasts that perform an immensely complex biblical children's opera every year.  Since her childhood Doll has been in these shows but now, at the age of fifteen or sixteen, she is to old to perform.  That suits her fine though.  She'll simply make herself indispensable to the adults running the show.  To do that, Doll becomes a sort of all-purpose gopher.  She finds ways to keep the unruly boys playing ravens in line.  She makes a full cast list and helps with costumes and music.  When a diplomat from the South American dictatorship of Matteo (made up for this book) insists that his son be included in the performance, Doll doesn't think much of it.  That is, until freedom fighters come to take the kid hostage.  And until they mess up the kidnapping and instead take all the children in the opera and all the parents hostage.  So things go from odd, to bad, to downright horrific.  And Doll suddenly finds herself in a performance after all.  One she never would have volunteered for.<br /><br />The correct term for this book is \\"thriller\\".  This is, in fact, a teen thriller in the purest sense.  It's wholly enmeshed in the politics of 1981, from its South American politics to critiques of hostage situations to criticism of the U.S. role in Latin American dictatorships.  Dickinson himself has purposefully given himself a terribly difficult job.  On the one hand, the revolutionaries who take over the church are doing an awful thing.  They see their cause as more important than the people they've taken prisoner.  They even stage a mock trial that is as much farce and theater as it is deadly earnest.  On the other hand, you sympathize with these people too.  They've been through hell.  Their lives have been destroyed repeatedly and it is only out of desperation that they've lowered themselves to this situation.  So how, as an author, do you balance the two and still make the book understandable to young adults?  At first Dickinson fails entirely.  Not because he doesn't give equal attention to either sides of the issue but because he loses the reader in a bizarre passage about Mattean politics right at the start.  If young adults reading this book are able to get past 27, they're in the clear.  If they don't, I can't really blame them.  It almost lost me there too.<br /><br />Another balancing actcomes with the idea of making a biblical opera fit in with the dangerous sections that follow.  As a former teen who worked in a children's theater long ago, I related to the theatrical portions of the tale.  To my mind, they're incredibly interesting.  I cannot claim that everyone would find themselves quite as thrilled as I was but I think they meld nicely with the dangerous moments that follow.  I loved the politics of the tale too.  The real hero of this book, as it turns out, comes in the form of Mrs. Dunnitt.  A longtime socialist and former Communist, Mrs. Dunnitt has the best view of how giving power to the oppressed can sometimes end in further, more creative, oppression.  Mrs. Dunnitt gives a fabulous speech near the end of the book about basic human rights and dignities.  It, if nothing else, is reason enough to read this tale.<br /><br />All in all, this is one of those rare teen books that raise questions no one else asks. How much is a rich nation responsible for the suffering of another if they support that country financially?  Where does the guilt lie?  In our leaders?  In ourselves?  You'll find few books that even think to ask such things.  In this case, the questions are left unanswered, allowing the viewer his or her own way of looking at things.  Whether you agree with the revolutionaries, the ambassador, or Mrs. Dunnitt, you'll find something in this book to make you think.  Though firmly set in 1981, what \\"The Seventh Raven\\" has to say continues to be imperative to people today.  I can't think of a better book to recommend to anyone who thinks they know anything about politics.

Fairy tales?  Find them the quintessential edition of \\"The Three Little Pigs\\" or \\"Rapunzel\\" and they are pleased.  Ordinarily this is a bit of a task.  I mean, what truly makes one version of a story any better than another if they are vastly different in composition and interpretation?  Which brings me to that 1955 Caldecott award winning little number, \\"Cinderella or The Little Glass Slipper\\".  Retold and illustrated by that deity amongst children's authors, Marcia Brown, the book is a most perfect retelling of the classic Cinderella story.  It's not the gory Grimm Brothers version (no eyes are pecked out nor heels chopped off) nor the hokey Disney concoction.  It is instead it's own sweet little creation, perfectly preserved within itself.  Written in the 1950s it simply tells a tale that it would be a good idea to know if you're going to operate fully in society.<br /><br />Usually at this point in the review I summarize the book.  But to be perfectly frank, I don't feel like doing that with this one.  \\"Cinderella\\" is what it is.  Girl, evil step-relatives, fairy godmother, pumpkin, prince, shoe, the end.  There you go.  That's the whole story in brief simple terms.  Brown's edition isn't as dull and staid as some of the traditional retellings, which is a relief to anyone reading and rereading this book to their kidoo.  Cinderella is just as lovely as ever with her blond hair and big eyelashed eyes.  What struck my fancy in this book is the odd mish-mash of costume styles present throughout.  When that good old fairy godmother appears she looks like a slightly moderated version of Queen Elizabeth complete with ruff and appropriate gown.  However, the stepsisters are clearly seen to be tied into corsets (circa 1890s, yes no?) while applying beauty marks (ala the French Revolution).  The prince also appears to be a bit of a 1700s swag, but his very presence makes it clear that whatever the time period, this book is clearly set in a rather fantastical era.<br /><br />As for the pictures themselves, they're evocative and lovely.  Somehow Brown's choice of palette ensures that the book is bound to be loved and remembered fondly by children and adults for years and years and years.  I could go into some odd diatribe about the inherent sexism of the book and Cinderella supremely wishy-washy tendencies, but for once let's just let the book be.  It's a nice story rendered in colorful cotton candy hues and presented in a lovely light-hearted package.  It may not be the smartest Marcia Brown creation, but I understand why she wasn't ashamed of it.  If you'd like a version of \\"Cinderella\\" that just tells the story and gives you something lovely to look at, choose this one.  It's purpose is to tell the tale in it simplest childlike form.

Do they really know what they're asking for or are they just going to huddle under their bedcovers late at night and have nightmares for weeks on end when you give in to their demands?  The book, \\"Wee Winnie Witch's Skinny\\" raises such questions because it's honestly a rather horrific peace of work.  A well-researched, folklore accurate, beautifully written horrific work, but a horrific one just the same.  Penned by the genius that brought us \\"The House of the Dies Drear\\" and \\"Sweet Whispers Brother Rush\\", Virginia Hamilton wrote this tale just before her death.  Now with accompanying engravings by Barry Moser it's an honestly original and disturbing piece of literature.  If Halloween rolls around and you want to show the kids a tale that will honestly knock their socks off, you couldn't do any better than this dark evocative tale of skinless witches, bridled men, and truly evil felines.<br /><br />There's something wrong with James Lee's Uncle Big Anthony.  Once a large strapping fellow, Anthony's been wasting away lately.  There are mysterious scratch marks on his shirts and a tear at the corner of his mouth, \\"where a cat-wich Winnie must've tried to bridle him\\".  The neighbors are saying that a Wee Winnie (a witch) must be after Uncle Big Anthony and there's nothing that can be done.  James Lee doesn't know about that, so he's determined to help any way they can.  Still, it's only with the aid of Mama Granny's spice-hot pepper witch-be-gone potion that one Wee Winnie Witch meets an ugly but well-deserved demise.<br /><br />After reading the book it's difficult to figure out how exactly this creation could have been published without the accompanying Barry Moser illustrations.  Evoking everything from lynching to slavery through the meticulous use of symbolism, light, and shadow, these pictures say a great deal about African-American history.  Telling her tale with references to various elements of black folklore, Hamilton is faithful to traditional black scare stories and, if anything, she does too good a job.  Still, it's Moser who brings these pictures horribly to life.  Want to see an old crone (obviously European) remove her skin in one large horrible hunk?  Or to view a black cat morphing into an evil woman, all long fingernails, teeth, and bloodshot eyes?  This story is too young for older children, but younger ones with sturdy constitutions may adore it in it's own right.  Or never want to open another book again out of fear.  It could really swing either way here.<br /><br />So when your child, aged five to nine years, pulls at your pantleg and asks you to get them a book at the library that's scary... REALLY scary... take them at their word.  Pick out \\"Wee Winnie Witch's Skinny\\" from the bookshelves, cuddle up at night, and tell them this excellent tale.  It will either be exactly what they're looking for or far far too much.  In any case, it'll remain a memorable way to prove to them the full-blooded excitement of reading.ences to various elements of black folklore, Hamilton is faithful to traditional black scare stories and, if anything, she does too good a job.

The answer to the age old question of what to give boys who hate to read but are being forced to by somebody, whether a teacher or a relative or someone else entirely.  There's something about Captain Underpants that is irresistible to a certain kind of boy or girl.  I think it may have something to do with the combination of its comic book format, deeply silly plotlines, and the overall packaging.  Whatever it is, when I'm at the children's desk of the library in which I work, I often see boys scurrying up to the desk to beg for help locating the \\"Captain Underpants section\\".  These boys are sometimes accompanied by overly concerned parents who mumble things like, \\"I guess you can take it out... just so long as you don't own it\\" under their breath.  For my own part, I wanted to see what all the fuss and folderol was about.  What is it about Captain Underpants that leaves kids always wanting more?  Whence its popularity?  The first book that started it all is none other than \\"The Adventures of Captain Underpants\\", so I plucked it from a shelf and sat down to give it a good once over.  A complete reading took roughly 30 minutes, if that.  And my conclusion?  Parents, if you want to be worried about what you child is reading, here is not the place to start.  For though we could probably talk back and forth for hours about the relative merits of reading every single Captain Underpants creation, the fact of the matter is that the book is harmless fun.  This is a popcorn book.  It's light and fluffy and delightful.  Just the kind of inane gibberish that'll lure kids to reading and keep them there.  Its value is in its good natured humor and light-hearted storylines.  It's not classy.  It's just fun.<br /><br />Everyone's got a nemesis.  Superman has Lex Luthor.  Batman has the Riddler.  And George and Harold?  Well these kids have one definite nemesis.  Principal Krupp.  For these merry pranksters, Krupp is a dangerous foe.  Still, it isn't until the kids pull some elaborate tricks on the elementary school football team that Mr. Krupp catches them red handed.  In an effort to escape their punishment, George and Harold order a hypnosis ring via The L'il Wiseguy Novelty Co.  The ring is a great success and with it the two boys can get their principal to do whatever they want.  When they decide to make him act like a comic book superhero they created, however, Mr. Krupp gets a little too into the act.  Suddenly he IS Captain Underpants in the flesh.  Worse still, George and Harold are having a lot of difficulty catching him to relieve him of the hypnosis.  And meanwhile there are evil robots robbing the city of a powerful crystal and a supervillain named Doctor Diaper to contend with.  It's up to Harold and George to defeat the villain, save the day, and keep Mr. Krupp safe.  Not easy, but all in the day for a pair of mischief making kids.<br /><br />I was a little amazed to learn that in the entire series, Captain Underpants is just a hypnotized Mr. Krupp.  Who knew?  The book is drawn very very simply.  Pilkey has done quite a few picture books in his time, the best one perhaps being \\"Julius\\" which he illustrated for author Angela Johnson.  This particular book utilizes a dozen different techniques to lure the attention of the kiddies.  There's a makeshift flip-book section (entitled \\"Flip-o-Rama\\") which is very popular and copious illustrations.  This is basically a comic book produced in book form with a lot of narration to go with the pictures.  And yes, some of the jokes in the book are more than a little infantile.  But for crying out loud people, it's a silly kid's book!  What do you expect?  Hamlet?  I had a fun time reading through it, though certainly once was enough for me.  Still, I can see the tale's allure.<br /><br />If you're searching for something that will appeal to that kid who doesn't seem to like any books at all, this is a great place to start.  There's underwear and fake doggy poop anditching powder and all sorts of craziness.  It's not gonna win a Pulitzer anytime soon.  It's not gonna win a Newbery Award anytime soon.  But if there's ever a kid's choice award offered, it may well win one of those.  A book to be taken with as much whimsy as you have on hand.ggy poop and itching powder and all sorts of craziness.

404342:US	49148452	RD4TOQB5DD9S1	0763611735	976248182	The Transmogrification of Roscoe Wizzle	Books	2	1	4	N	N	It'll bug you	A fine fine article in the monthly publication \\"School Library Journal\\" was published less than a year ago discussing those children's books that publishers were amazed didn't get the critical and public attention they deserved.  Amongst such titles was the fabulous and little known \\"Don't Pat the Wombat\\" by Elizabeth Honey, \\"Simon Says\\" by Elaine Marie Alphin, and \\"Kisses From Rosa\\" by Petra Mathers.  These books were all fine fine reads and I eagerly was working my way through all the titles on the list when I came to \\"The Transmogrification of Roscoe Wizzle\\" by David Elliott.  I wasn't familiar with Elliott's other works (\\"An Alphabet of Rotten Kids\\" anyone?) but I was willing to give this book a shot.  And it's a fine read.  A nice inoffensive middle-of-the-road read.  I will say this much though... I'm surprised it was included in that \\"School Library Journal\\" article.  For with all its charms and allures, \\"The Transmogrification of Roscoe Wizzle\\" probably does deserve to be a little forgotten.  It's fine writing.  Just not extraordinary stuff.<br /><br />And everything was going so well for Roscoe Wizzle too.  When a gigantic hamburger chain named Gussy's comes to town, Roscoe and everyone else is thrilled.  Sure, the restaurant seems to have been built on that abandoned city lot where a lot of freaky things have been seen, but no one thinks to worry about it.  Heck, with two lazy/distracted parents, Roscoe's just happy that he gets to eat at Gussy's as often as he does.  Every day for dinner his parents slip him some cash and off he goes to have a Gussy burger and shake.  But then one day it all starts to go horribly wrong.  Roscoe doesn't notice at first, but with the words of a school chum he discovers that he's changing into a bug.  He has buggy eyes and a bug-shaped face and some new bugish tendencies.  With the help of his best friend Kinchy, Roscoe has to figure out what's doing this to him and whether or not it has anything to do with the mysterious kidnapping of children that's been going on for the last week or so.  In discovering the answers to both these questions, Roscoe's about to find out more than he ever anticipated about the secret life of corporations.<br /><br />The book has one thing really going for it.  When Roscoe learns about the three kidnapped children that are missing, author Elliott gives the book a deliciously creepy turn.  But it's difficult to keep such tension up and, in any case, there's not much of a book to maintain.  Which is to say, it's sparse.  Sparse and over before you can figure out what exactly you just read.  There is no way to linger over \\"The Transmogrification of Roscoe Wizzle\\".  For one thing, characters are hardly developed at all.  Actually, we hear quite a lot about each important character.  Unfortunately, what we hear is just the same thing over and over and over.  Roscoe's friend Kinchy?  She's smart.  So smart, in fact, that I don't think she appears once in this story without Roscoe saying something along the lines of \\"She is a certified genius\\" or \\"since Kinchy is a certified genius\\".  The same goes for Roscoe's mother (she was an orphan), his father (high strung), and Gussy secretary Agnes Bean (jujitsu expert).  This is about as much as you ever find out about these people (over and over and over).  There's also the fact that this book is chock full of the most ludicrous coincidences any author could dare to conjure up.  Coincidence is the hobgoblin of little minds and I'm sad to say that David Elliott utilizes this writing style above and beyond anything I could forgive.  I mean, how believable is it that Kichy would just happen to be the tutor to the secretary of the book's bad guy?<br /><br />And how hard would it have been to include some oblique Kafka reference?  I know I'm getting a little demanding here (reviewers aren't supposed to criticize reviews for what they failed to include, even if it WOULD be a good idea) but I'm not writing for a scholarly journal of some sort.  I'm writing for Amazon.com and I'd just like to point out that it was just laziness on Elliott's part that there's not a single \\"Metamorphosis\\" reference with the sole exception of a moment in the book when Kinchy says the word and Roscoe defines it.  Even the children's book \\"Gregor the Overlander\\" by Suzanne Collins (which includes gigantic cockroaches) thought to make some kind of an oblique tip of the hat.  Elliott actually has a kid turning into another insect and he fails to do so.  Either it's laziness, or he's just not familiar with Kafka.<br /><br />So there's that.  I think kids may really enjoy this book if they get into it.  It's got a great premise.  Just not much of any details, careful plotting, or great writing.  I feel that an additional 100 pages could've taken this story from mediocre to entrancing.  As it is, it's not all that great.  For well written but forgotten children's books, check out the titles I mentioned earlier.  It's just a pity that \\"The Transmogrification of Roscoe Wizzle\\" isn't really worth remembering.

What was it about the seals of the British Isles that struck islanders as mysterious and mildly frightening?  I can understand why they were sometimes mistaken for humans and mermaids.  In the water a seal is as lithe and graceful as it is bulky and sluggish on land.  Still, there have been a fair amount of selkie tales that place the mysterious creatures firmly into the realm of the creepy.  From Mollie Hunter's dark, \\"A Stranger Came Ashore\\" to Eve Ibbotson's light-hearted but sometimes dour, \\"Island of the Aunts\\", these wondrous creatures have inspired a great number of children's authors to weave together tales of the selkies of the deep.  With \\"Daughter of the Sea\\", author Berlie Doherty strives to do the same.<br /><br />Jannet and Munroe were not meant to find the sleeping babe floating between the rocks of the skerries.  But find the child they did, and in their  childless state the dearest wish of their hearts has come true.  They've been given a daughter of their own to raise and love.  Watching enviously from her beachside home, indigent Eilean o da Freya watches the gift that should have been hers as the child grows and learns.  Eilean understands exactly what little Gioga (as her parents have named her) is and she will use this knowledge carefully in the future.  Meanwhile, mysterious creatures from the deep are preparing to take the girl back with them.  If Jannet and Munroe resist, they may find themselves in a deeper muddle than they ever could have imagined.<br /><br />Doherty has penned a rather classic tale.  \\"Daughter of the Sea\\" follows in the tradition of all those classic fairy tales about children that don't quite belong.  The old standby of the barren couple who want to raise a kid of their own is in everything from ancient Norse myths to classic Brothers Grimm tales.  In this particular case, \\"Daughter of the Sea\\" is mightily similar to Eloise McGraw's, \\"The Moorchild\\".  In both books you have young daughters that are a little different from everyone else and feel drawn to mysterious beings they want to understand.  In the case of this book, Gioga is a little different from your average heroine.  She's so drawn to the sea that she can barely pay attention to the people who love her.  You're not certain how or who to root for in this tale, but it's fairly clear that the moral of the story is that you shouldn't prevent your children from being who they are rather than who you want them to be.<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"Daughter of the Sea\\" isn't particularly original.  It's definitely written well enough, don't get me wrong.  And it also makes for a relatively quick read for kids.  But the story doesn't break any new ground.  The magic found here could just as easily be found in any classic selkie folktale.  Even the conclusion is matter-of-fact and predictable.  \\"Daughter of the Sea\\" is a nice kind of Intro-to-adapted-folktales.  Yet if you're looking for something gripping, original, and a lot of fun then this would not be my first recommendation.  Select any of the other books I've mentioned if you like.

Now to critique a kid's book that falls in the historical fiction genre there's really only one standard to which you should hold the book directly accountable: Do accurate historical facts about the story make the book more interesting or less interesting?  Which is to say, does the story stand on its own two feet?  Has this book taken true tales and given them new life or has it created an entirely fictional (some would say fanciful) world that bears little resemblance to what really did occur back in the day?  I am pleased to report that Gennifer Choldenko's book, \\"Al Capone Does My Shirts\\" sits strongly in the former category.  Taking true facts, following them up with historical research and footnotes, and giving the whole book a real but fascinating feel, Choldenko has written one of the great chidren's novels of 2004.  The story is deeply interesting and continually gripping without boring the reader once.  The premise is alluring but it's Choldenko's excellent writing that solidifies this puppy as a must-read for all ages.<br /><br />Not many kids get to live on an island chock full of the world's most dangerous prisoners.  But not many kids are Moose Flanagan.  When his father takes a job as a guard on Alcatraz Island, just off the coast of San Francisco, Moose finds himself in alarmingly close proximity with a variety of different vicious criminals.  The whole reason his father took the job, of course, is because of Moose's sister Natalie.  A victim of autism, Natalie's condition isn't one that's easy to treat in 1935 America.  The family has just discovered a wonderful school that might do Natalie some great good if they can only get her into it.  Unfortunately, treating Natalie so that she's acceptable to the school may require her to spend copious amounts of time with Moose when he'd rather be playing baseball.  And then there's that awful warden's daughter, Piper, who keeps getting Moose and his friends into trouble all the time.  Things are a lot more interesting on an island prison than even Moose might have suspected.<br /><br />The book does several very difficult things simultaneously.  First of all, it tells the story of Moose and Natalie without appealing to the lowest common denominator.  I was deathly afraid that this might turn into one of those \\"Beautiful Mind\\"/\\"I Am Sam\\"/\\"Shine\\"/any other triumph-over-adversity story you'd like to name.  I was hoping against hope that this would not end up being some teary weeper with a perfect happy ending and an idealized struggle against the unknowable.  Now, admittedly, the ending is (not to give anything away) pretty darn perfect.  Choldenko isn't afraid of employing a little deus ex machina to get her way.  On the other hand, she pulls it off.  Sure, the ending's just a tad schlocky.  But it's also exactly what the reader wants to hear.  There are no happy endings for autistic kids in a 1935 world, but this one comes pretty darn close.<br /><br />Another difficult thing the book manages is to ever-so-slightly redeem the story's resident demon from the fourth dimension of Hell, Piper.  This girl is trouble, but worse she's self-centered, cruel, and cunning.  Moose knows right from the start not to trust her, but she's also cute and Moose is fourteen-years-old and not entirely in charge of his hormones.  I guess I spend a lot of my time reading children's books in a state of deathly fear because not only was I worried that this would be a cheesy heartwarming tale but I was also afraid that Piper would be utterly redeemed by the tale's end.  And gosh darn it, I hated Piper!  I hated her so much it wasn't funny.  I mean, she almost gets the other kids' parents fired, she mocks Natalie (calls her \\"retarded\\" no less), she lies, tries to use Natalie as bait to get at a con, and is generally awful all over.  Yet Choldenko gives her a slight improvement by the book's end.  Nothing mind-blowing.  Nothing miraculous.  Just an ever-so-slight change from breathtaking evil to almost having a heart.  And in a lesser author's hands this would've been either unbelievable or callous or both.  Yet Choldenko pulls it, and many other plot points too, off with a skill I've not seen in a rising children's author in some time.<br /><br />So let's review.  You've got a book that is chock full of facts.  I mean, the author even includes a note at the back that explains what was made up and points out which facts may have been stretched.  She's so accurate that she even feels the need to point out that the weather she's listed here, \\"does not reflect the exact weather of 1935\\".  Now THAT, ladies and gentlemen, is a writer who cares about preserving a historical record.  In addition to this, the book does not pull at your heart-strings in a cheap and lazy fashion.  It's honest and appealing and treats Natalie's autism brilliantly (possibly because Choldenko's own sister had a severe form of autism).  Finally, it redeems the unredeemable believably.  I don't know what else I can say except to point out that on top of all this the book's a very enjoyable read.  It has characters you care for, real moments of tension and suspense, a brilliant setting, and a superb ear for dialogue.  If you want to booktalk a new story to the kids you know, just offer them this tale about a guy who lives near gangsters and murderers.  I think they'll bite.othing miraculous.

I mean, it's obvious when you consider it.  James Howe's quite the talented man and \\"Horace and Morris but Mostly Dolores\\" is one of those picture books that stay with you long after an initial reading.  After paging through the story I went on with my life.  I went to work.  I watched some television.  I ate some Chinese food for lunch at a remarkably low price.  And all the time that I was doing all this I'd find myself thinking back to \\"Horace and Morris but Mostly Dolores\\".  I thought about some of the careful phrasings James Howe uses in the book.  I thought about what he's saying about gender, and social constructions, and friendship.  I thought about how well the story was paced and how you can write a really good picture book without its characters resorting to malice or nastiness.  In the end, I just have to say that this is one of those stories that stays with you.  You will not find yourself significantly changed by the book and your children may only find it mildly diverting rather than mind-blowing.  But it's darn good.  Darn tootin' good.<br /><br />So there are three small mice at the helm of this tale.  There is Horace.  And there is Morris.  And there is (mostly) Dolores.  These three are good friends who partake of a great many adventures, schemes, and exciting walkabouts.  Then, one day, the two boys come across the Mega-Mice clubhouse.  Eyeing the sign that states that no girls are allowed (\\"What kind of place doesn't allow girls?, Dolores wondered\\") Dolores is regretfully but swiftly abandoned.  Following suit she joins The Cheese Puffs, a remarkably girly club.  This goes on for some time until Dolores can take it no longer (the Cheese Puffs have a tendency to carve things out of cheese and that's about it) and announces that she's going exploring.  The girls show no interest, with the exception of Chloris.  They march over to the boys and Morris and Horace join them (with new friend Boris).  And thus it is that a new club is begun.  And everyone is allowed to join.<br /><br />Sweet stuff.  James Howe is to be commended for the book, not least because he managed to think of four names that rhyme with Dolores.  And yes, it's always nice to read a well-written book about inclusion that doesn't whop you over the head with its saccharine sweet message.  \\"Horace and Morris but Mostly Dolores\\" is tightly written and consistently interesting.  Howe's words are especially good here.  When Dolores tries to joke with the boys about choosing to go to an all-boy club the book points out that, \\"They didn't even smile\\".  When she herself makes a joke later, she is not smiling either.  Howe was coupled for this book with illustrator Amy Walrod who, prior to this tale, had never done a children's book before.  It does not show.  Using a cartoony style of acrylics and collage, Walrod won my heart through her infinite funny details.  For example, when Dolores decides to leave the girly mice, one of them is clearly seen constructing a detailed diagram of getting a \\"fella\\" through the meticulous use of mozzarella.  And when Dolores and Chloris invite Horace and Morris along, it took me a couple readings to notice that they were (at the time) tied up by their fellow \\"friends\\".<br /><br />Let's recap.  Smart writing.  Good message (though admittedly I remember being a big fan of all-girl clubs when I was a lass).  Great illustrations.  I can't say it any clearer than that, my friends.  \\"Horace and Morris but Mostly Dolores\\" is a top-notch work of mousy art.  One of the great picture books of the last ten years.

Their popularity comes from a variety of different areas.  \\"Locomotion\\", like its fellow verse novel brethren, follows a sad youth as he discovers the beauty of verse and chronicles his life's problems and joys through this new medium.  The result is a story told entirely in different kinds of poems.  Long poems, short poems, sonnets, haiku, and letters to be exact.  Kids love this book because it's a quick read.  Educators like it because it teaches children about the beauty of free-flowing verse and is spotted with such mentions as Langston Hughes and Richard Wright.  And librarians like it because it's a clever way of getting kids to read.  Is the book the most original of its kind?  No, not so much.  But it is interesting and well-written and fun.  A superb addition to any library, whether public, private, or at school.<br /><br />Know a kid who just can't keep still?  Who fidgets and yells and just generally enjoys life itself?  Then you know a kid like Locomotion.  Lonnie Collins Motion (Lo-Co-Motion) is frisky but deeply upset.  It's not been long since his parents died in a house fire and he and his sister were separated between different foster families.  Lonnie's staying with Miss Edna, a woman who enjoys silent kids but has a real soft spot in her heart for Lonnie.  His sister is with a different woman, one who enjoys clean houses, religious children, and people who are NOT Lonnie.  Fortunately, Lonnie's teacher at school, Ms. Marcus, has gotten him interested in writing down his thoughts in the form of poems.  Suddenly Lonnie can't stop writing them!  He puts down everything in his life that there is.  His friends (one of whom comes down with sickle cell anemia), the girl he likes, his nights on the roof staring up into the stars, and many memories of his parents.  Through the course of the book you get a real feel for Lonnie.  You know that he's the kind of kid who'll end up doing well.  And you know you shouldn't worry too deeply about him. He's smart enough to know how to get along in life.  After all, he's already been through the worst.<br /><br />The book tackles everything from race (Lonnie's black and often notices when white people, like his teacher, stumble along ignorantly) to class to personal integrity.  This is perhaps one of the first children's books I've read that discusses soldiers fighting in the Middle East overseas in a straightforward manner (most impressive when you consider its 2003 publication date).  I suspect \\"Locomotion\\" is bound to be parsed apart by eager teachers for the benefit of their students.  I harbor some slight hope though that maybe some kid will find the book all on his or her own.  Maybe they'll be attracted to its cover, where Lonnie dances about goofily.  Maybe they'll like its form or what it's not afraid to say.  And maybe, just maybe, some kid reading it will be inspired to write a poem or two about their own life.  That's not a crazy thought, right?<br /><br />\\"Locomotion\\" is like a slightly older and more mature version of Sharon Creech's, \\"Love That Dog\\".  But while \\"Love That Dog\\" deals with the death of a pet and a boy's discovery of poetry, \\"Locomotion\\" is about the death of parents and a boy's discovery of what it means to be alive.  Between the two, I'd choose \\"Locomotion\\" any day.  A funny touching story that perfectly compliments its rambunctious narrator.  If you've a reluctant reader on your hands, it's at least worth a shot to let them discover it.You know that he's the kind of kid who'll end up doing well.

Amongst these is the rule of three.  If a household contains three children and there is a fortune to be made, that fortune will be attained not by the first or second children (who are doomed to fail simply due to their birthdates) but by the third.  Fairy tales are filled to overflowing with stories about third children.  It doesn't take too much imagination to see how much more interesting it is to read a story about a first child instead.  In \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" author Diana Wynne Jones pays tribute to the great folktales of the past by turning them topsy-turvy upside-down.  The book is an amusing picaresque mystery tale about a girl's attempts to remedy her newly ancient state.<br /><br />Sophie did not mean to upset the Witch of the Waste.  It's just one of those things that happens.  After working in her stepmother's hat shop for months on end, Sophie's somewhat remarkable workmanship attracts the unwanted attention of a very nasty sorceress.  For what appears to be no reason at all, the Witch enchants Sophie to become the age of ninety, or so.  With a newfound sense that she no longer need worry about what people think of her, Sophie blossoms in her new state.  Just the same, she'd like to get her old body back, and so it's off to the Wizard Howl (a man reported to eat the hearts out of young girls) for a cure.  Hopping a ride on Howl's remarkable moving castle (hence the book's name) she befriends the not-so-evil but undeniably vain sorcerer, his apprentice Michael, and their snarky fire demon, Calcifer.  What follows is a race to escape the witch, free Calcifer, and figure out just exactly what Howl does or does not know about his new senior citizen servant.<br /><br />The book's a remarkable combination of styles.  You have your fantasy, your fairy tale, your mystery, and your subdued but nonetheless present romance.  Jones has always been a fan of fantasy stories in which the tale will suddenly produce one heckuva twist 80% of the way through.  \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" is no different, and the twist (while something anyone other than myself could probably have seen coming a mile away) is a shocker.  The best thing about the book though is the easygoing relationships between the characters.  Once Sophie settles down and makes the castle her home (while she tries to find a way to get her old body) she develops a wonderful relationship with Howl, Michael, Calcifer, and any other random people who might stop by (like a dog-man or an enchanted scarecrow, perhaps).  Like many of Jones' heroes and heroines she's completely unaware of her own remarkable abilities.  If there's any continual theme present throughout Jones' works, it's the idea of knowing oneself.  Sophie doesn't, and until she discovers the extent of her own remarkable qualities, she's doomed to putter about.<br /><br />It's a great idea too, making the heroine of a tale sixty or seventy years older than she should be.  Howl, for his part, is a great character if a little dodgy at times.  He's as vain as a peacock, often appearing as a slightly wittier version of Gilderoy Lockhart from \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\".  His transformation by the book's end was, needless to say, straining the boundaries of credulity.  Just the same, you can't help but fall in love with this story.  Yes yes, it kinda falls apart near the end with so many subplots, red herrings, and sudden characters cropping up here and there that you either lose track of what's going on or reread every paragraph three times over just to get your bearings.  Jones has a tendency to rush her endings, and the ending of \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" works at a breakneck speed.  I wish she'd lingered a little longer over the happy ending too.  Once the danger of the book has passed, everything gets wrapped up in a neat little bow quicker than you can spit.  I would've liked a little luxuriating in the characters' newfound happinesses, but you go with what you've got.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" is bound to please both those Diana Wynne Jones newbies out there who've never so much as glanced at a word of hers before, and those tried and true stalwart fans who methodically gobble her books up like so many Pac-Man pellets.  I wouldn't name this as my favorite of her stories (hats off to \\"Archer's Goon\\" for that honor) but I did have a wonderful time reading it.  If you'd like a book that is a joy to read and won't do anything but please you, select this one immediately.

It was really just a stroke of luck that author Pauline Clarke happened to be the one to put pen to paper and write the tale herself.  Or rewrite it, depending on your interpretation.  \\"The Return of the Twelves\\" takes a classic storytale form (toys coming alive in the presence of children) and ups the ante tenfold.  It acknowledges the ingenuity of the Bronte children (placing far more importance on Branwell than he probably deserved) yet makes it lively enough to be perfectly understood by kids today.  It's odd to say, but as fantasy tales go, \\"The Return of the Twelves\\" is timeless in all the best senses of the term.  It's one of those little known children's books that everyone should at least have a passing familiarity with.  One of the great little known books for kids.<br /><br />Max has a secret.  An incredible, mysterious, overwhelming secret.  When he discovered a cache of old wooden soldiers in his family's new attic, he thought they were fun and all but nothing particularly special.  Sure, his dad said that may be over a hundred years old, but that still wasn't too shocking.  No, it was the fact that the soldiers were alive.  Magnificently alive.  Finding himself now a benevolent deity to a crew of twelve lively individuals, Max befriends his tiny pals and discovers their secrets.  They were once the property of the Bronte children, years and years ago.  Their exploits have been well recorded in \\"History of the Young Men\\" (by Branwell Bronte) and their names and personalities established therein.  Yet when an American collector offers a high price for the Twelves, wherever they might be, Max finds his new friends threatened and acts of heroism and derring-do quickly follow.<br /><br />The real genius of the book comes from the fact that Clarke began with something real (\\"History of the Young Men\\" WAS created by the four Bronte kids) and adapted it seamlessly with fantastical elements (living soldiers).  The effect is that the book works like a slightly more mature \\"Indian in the Cupboard\\" or even \\"Toy Story\\".  In the hands of a lesser artist, this tale would've been trite or cheap.  Certainly the soldiers never really act like real men.  They're perfectly content to scale great heights in the attic or act like toys in fake battles against chessmen.  Still, Clarke is to be commended for giving each soldier an individual personality and history in keeping with that determined by the original Brontes.<br /><br />Which is not to say that the book doesn't have its flaws.  I mean, it was originally written in 1962.  I think you can guess the state of the gender roles.  Also, there are odd plot points that come up at interesting moments.  An evil toy seeker near the end of the book adds a bit of \\"Huh?\\" to the overall proceedings.  But as it is, the book has pretty much held up well.  There are some scenes of genuine tension when the Twelves escape from Max's attic and attempt to make it to the Brontes' original home.  And there are mysteries that remain long after the story finishes.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fine piece of literature.  Nothing dates it so much that kids today reading it won't be enthused by the characters' foibles, betrayals, and loyalities.  And any boy or girl who stares at their dolls lovingly, hoping to bring them to true three-dimensional life, will empathize with this story.

It's a book that remains complex and difficult to review if only because I'm still not certain what to think of it.  Making 9-11 into something palatable to five-year-olds is a tricky proposition as it is.  But while I may have my qualms with this book, I will concede that it's probably an okay way to introduce the subject of September 11th to one's children.<br /><br />The book is based on a true story.  One of the many unsung human moments that occurred during and after the days of the September attacks.  It is about two sister who lived in South Africa growing commercial roses.  Having entered their roses in the Agriflowers and Floritech Expo in New York City, they packed up 2,400 of the beauties for presentation.  Their arrival, however, coincided with September 11th itself.  With no Expo to attend and nowhere to go, the two were forced to live in the airport for a little while with their copious boxes of roses.  After being taken in by members of the First United Methodist Church of Flushing, New York they decided to find some way to repay such kindness.  All 2,400 roses were picked up and taken to Union Square.  There, they were laid out in the shape of the twin towers, the center of New York's mourning.  Says author Jeanette Winter in the end, \\"My tears fell on the roses\\".<br /><br />It's a rather beautiful story, and one that Winter informs us is quite true.  Of course, there are no facts or names presented in this tale.  The women are never identified and therefore take on somewhat mythic proportions.  One does wonder if Winter ever attempted to contact the women, or if she simply took their story for her own.  It's certainly a good way of showing how individual people were affected by the ugliness of that day and the selflessness that came out of it.  Still, I did wish it had at least been dedicated to them or something.  The tone is particularly storybookish, as if writing in a style other than that of a fable would've been too harsh a choice.  And again the factual factors bug me.  Did the two women really live in a little house where flowers \\"brightened every room\\"?  If so, why doesn't Winter say that she did the usual research on this tale?<br /><br />As for the pictures, they are sparse pen and ink illustrations, occasionally colored in as appropriate.  In the book, all pictures before the attacks are bright and jolly with an array of shades.  The minute the towers are hit, however, the palate is entirely black and white and gray.  The only colors left come from candles lit in memory, the flowers placed in the shape of the towers, and a single tear that waters them.  The style fits the story well, and the only real objection I had to it was that this book (much like the unfortunate \\"Fireboat\\") decided that it would be a more dramatic, rather than accurate, choice to show the two planes approaching the towers together.<br /><br />I think what the book does best is capture the expression of grief.  This is a story that really does fill the reader, to some extent, with sorrow.  And hope.  There are just these niggling little flaws here and there that keep this from being THE quintessential method of explaining 9/11/01 to children.  I liked it, but I still harbor some uncertainties about it.  Undoubtedly some people will be able to look past my nitpicking and find the book to be a beautiful commemoration of a painful day.  Others may find my points to be even more harrowing than I myself did.  The book relies entirely on the reader's relationship to that day.  For some, it will fill a void.  For others, it'll trivialize that time.  Recommended tentatively., it'll trivialize that time.  Recommended tentatively.	2004-12-23

Books	5	8	9	N	N	Daisy Daisy, give me your answer do	I suppose, in the strictest sense of the term, that \\"Come Along, Daisy\\" could be categorized as a cautionary tale.  I mean, certainly there are negative consequences for any child that refuses to heed his or her mother while traveling.  Still, the book cautions without scaring.  It's a remarkably tender little tale that manages to be evocative and dark without descending into morbidity.  And it's just doggone sweet.<br /><br />Daisy is a young duckling, still wearing her yellow feathers and trailing after her mama.  While out in the swamp one day, Mama tells Daisy to heed her and to not fall behind.  Daisy, however, is too distracted to listen closely to her mother.  There are fish to observe and dragonflies to chase.  There are lily pads to jump on (with a \\"bouncy, bouncy, bouncy. Bong, bong!\\") and frogs to observe at close proximity.  Unfortunately, soon Daisy's frog hops away leaving the small helpless duckling very much alone.  Things under the lily pad scare her.  Things flying up in the sky scare her.  And a very loud noise definitely scares her.  That is, until she find out that it's just Mama Duck with her customary, \\"Come along, Daisy\\".  Needless to say, Daisy learns her lesson.<br /><br />This is just one of the latest in a long line of books that inform children not to get separated from their parents in public spaces.  Of course, it doesn't engage in much of the way of practical advice.  Mama Duck doesn't tell Daisy that if she gets lost she should stand in one place and not move.  But I suppose Mama Duck is in charge of the situation the entire time in this story.  In any case, this is a just a good story that tells kids to listen to their guardians when out n' about.  Author Jane Simmons also doubles as an illustrator for this story, and it is here that she really stands out and shines.  Simmons has a grasp of perpective and tone that just fits her story like a warm comforting glove.  Painted entirely in thick beautiful paints, the book shows the slight tints of the early morning sun, the fetid marshes when Daisy is abandoned, and the eerie green cattails of an unknown swamp.  Characters are rendered beautifully as well.  When Daisy is happy she leaps about with toddler-like abandon.  When scared, her eyes stare blankly out behind an enormous worried beak.  And when she sees her mother, at long last, her entire body arches towards her, going as fast as she possibly can.<br /><br />Children can handle tales of abandonment if everything turns out well in the end.  \\"Come Along, Daisy\\" has the added delight of there never being a particularly dire threat to the little duckling in the first place.  Even that dark image of a hawk flying above shows Mama Duck swimming placidly nearby.  There is great comfort in reading about Daisy's adventures.  This book is a perfect little lesson about the bond between a child and its guardian, specifically that between mother and child.

Studies show.... actually I haven't a clue what studies show.  I haven't a clue if kids, little kids who are just beginning to read on their own, understand metaphors.  Some do, I suspect.  Others, not so much.  Now, the book \\"Good Night, Good Knight\\", is a pretty obvious metaphor.  And little children reading it will probably understand what the dragons in it represent and what the knight himself represents.  Even if they don't, it's a smashing good tale.  Sweet without descending into saccharine.  Cute without being cutesy.  It has just the right amounts of adorableness and neediness within its pages.  Parents will be able to read it again and again without gagging.  Kids will be able to read it with pure unadulterated pleasure.<br /><br />Once there were three little dragons who didn't live all that far away from a good knight.  One night the knight hears a roar.  He hops on his horse to investigate and meets a small dragon in a cave.  The dragon is not particularly surprised to see the knight (words along the lines of \\"Oh good.  You have come\\" are bandied about) and asks for a drink of water before it goes to bed.  The knight is wary but acquiesces and the little dragon is tucked into bed.  No sooner than the knight goes home does he hear another roar.  This comes from a second dragon who wants a story plus the first dragon who wants another drink of water.  By the time the knight is called to take care of a third little dragon the reader sees where all this is going.  The story is an excellent tale of an increasingly weary knight as he attempts to cajole and tuck in three mildly demanding little dragons for beddy-bye.  At the end, the dragons are asleep (finally!) and the knight finally gets to fall into his own bed for the night.<br /><br />I think what saves this book is the fact that though the dragons are somewhat demanding, they are quite polite.  A story about three spoiled tantrum-throwing dragons who refuse to go to bed would have been, how do you say, not so nice to read.  These dragons speak in full sentences and request only those things that small children would request.  Stories, kisses on their scaly cheeks, stories, and songs. An added pleasure comes in the form of Jennifer Plecas' illustrations.  Rendered in somewhat cartoony watercolors, the little dragons all have nightgowns, pjs, and various toys and stuffed animals.  The knight, for his part, often looks surprised but never outright displeased.  Like every patient parent he gets a little weary with the continual requests (his facial expression when all three roar for him together is one that every parent will recognize and sympathize with) but rarely upset.<br /><br />There is nothing frightening in this book.  There is nothing mildly disturbing.  There is just a sweet bedtime story about a knight and his sudden dragony charges.  This is a good bedtime book, if only because it's one of the few whose plot isn't based on children refusing to go to bed.  This time it's children perfectly willing to go to bed but with some stipulations beforehand.  If you'd like a book that will amuse you and please your children all at once, \\"Good Night, Good Knight\\" does indeed fit the bill.

Listen to the following people, places, and things that crop up in this novel: A young girl who is sickly is sent to the British countryside.  She encounters a mansion and hears a boy her age crying.  The boy is sickly and often ill, spending much of his time indoors in bed.  She also meets a rougher streetwise boy who is much different, in class as well as personality, from the weaker blond boy.  Sound just a touch like Francess Hodgson Burnett's well-known, \\"The Secret Garden\\" doesn't it?  Though incorporating various plot points and characters similar to that of Burnett's book, the book is incredibly different.  Yes, there are still potential ghosts haunting the living and mysterious elements (like a hedge maze with evil intents) but the book stands perfectly on its own.  It's a more modern \\"Secret Garden\\", rife with plot twists and people you don't know if you can trust.  Think of \\"The Sylvia Game\\" as a kind of \\"House of Cards\\" for kids.<br /><br />Emily's trip with her father to the countryside isn't as nice as she might have hoped.  A permanently broke artist, Emily's father is schemer at heart.  And while the two of them stay in an expensive inn (the money paying for it is mysteriously kept hidden from young Emily) it is clear that her father is up to something or other.  In an effort to figure out what he's being so secretive of, the girl uses a local boy, Kevin, to help her track her dad.  Her tailing takes her to the Mallerton Manor and into the presence of the Mallerton heir, Oliver.  Oliver cannot help but notice how similar Emily looks to Sylvia, his drowned sister.  Through constant contact with Oliver and Kevin, Emily suddenly finds herself in an odd twisted situation in which no one she knows is quite what they appear.  Did Oliver even have a sister?  What's Kevin's connections to the Mallertons?  What are her father's connection to this undoubtedly odd family?  And what does Oliver truly want from her?  Who was Sylvia, really?<br /><br />The deeper the book gets, the less you trust what you've already learned.  This occasionally made for confusing reading for myself, a twenty-six-year-old reader.  You can just imagine how a ten-year-old would take it.  Still, Alcock is to be commended for never allowing the book to decay into absolute dadaism.  It's a twisty little creation, but not so twisty that it's impossible to keep up with.  The real problem with the novel, in the end, is that the further you get into it the less likable the characters become.  For example, poor little rich boy waif Oliver (a Twist he's not) lies with incredible ease.  Emily pities the boy but never becomes as angry with him as she should.  He manipulates all the characters in the story like some twelve-year-old Godfather, yet is never held accountable for most of his actions.  This doesn't make him the most identifiable person in the book.  And when he teams up with Kevin, the two can become truly awful to Emily sometimes.  In the end, Emily herself was the only person in the book I really liked as a human being.  Not the best recommendation for the story.<br /><br />Still, the book's a smart piece of work.  Kids who like mysteries will enjoying putting together the puzzle of who Sylvia is, what Oliver's up to, and how the Mallerton fortune enters into it all.  This is an ideal recommendation for those kids who liked \\"Chasing Vermeer\\" and want another kids-solve-a-mystery-involving-a-painting book.  And even adults will find themselves pondering over the book's red herrings and sly meanderings.  I didn't enjoy \\"The Sylvia Game\\" as much as I might have liked, but it's still a hearty and enjoyable read.

This was the first time I'd done such a class, so I was a little nervous about how to reach 'em.  The last thing I wanted was to bomb in front of them.  I needed a picture book that would really capture their attention.  That would make them sit up and take notice.  That would let them believe that the library is a cool and happening place full of wonderful fascinating books.  So to what book did I turn in my moment of trial?  Why to Steve Jenkins' fabulous, \\"Actual Size\\", of course.  This has suddenly become my sure-fire go-to book.  No child that encounters this puppy walks away without falling deeply in love with it.  All that and it's chock full of useful scientific facts too.<br /><br />The premise of \\"Actual Size\\" is canny.  Using his customary illustration techniques of utilizing cut and torn paper, author/illustrator Steve Jenkins has created a book full of different kinds of animals.  But unlike your average book that, say, summarizes the wingspan of the atlas moth, each illustration in this story is actual size.  Which is to say, if the pygmy shrew is only two inches long, then the illustration of that shrew in this book will also be two inches long.  This makes for some highly original displays.  There's no way you could fit the entire giant squid into the book's pages.  Therefore, one two-page spread is devoted entirely to the giant squid's eye (12 inches across and freaky freaky freaky).  Other pages display an anteater's two-foot-long tongue (twisted about to fit in the necessary illustration).  We get an up close and personal view of the four-inch jagged teeth of the great white shark.  There are even huge insects (like the giant walking stick) and slimy critters (the monumentally disgusting 36-inch long Gippsland earthworm).  Every page contains some brief facts and statistics about the creature being displayed, followed up by more in-depth material at the back of the book.<br /><br />Needless to say, kids can't get enough of \\"Actual Size\\".  The best reactions you can get are when you have the kids compare their tiny hands with the gigantic mit of the gorilla.  When I showed my engrossed class this illustration they went gaga, clamoring to reach out and \\"touch\\" the great primate's palm.  Children also get wrapped up in some of the book's lesser known facts.  I took a great deal of delight in informing my captive audience that the Goliath frog eats birds and rats.  And, of course, some of their reactions were surprising.  When I showed the anteater page, hoping to wow them with the idea of a tongue that's two-feet-long, they were instead thrilled that the picture showed termites.  Go figure.<br /><br />If you're at all familiar with Jenkins' Caldecott honor winning, \\"What Do You Do With a Tail Like This?\\" then you know what to expect from him.  Highly original cut paper pictures.  We're not talking namby-pamby Eric Carle \\"The Very Hungry Caterpillar\\" type stuff.  We're talking breathtaking how-do-you-convey-that-picture-with-cut-paper type images here.  This book has a life entirely of its own.  As with all Jenkins' creations, I was pleased to see bright and colorful pictures (the Siberian tiger, for example) next to pictures that required the smallest of details (like the pygmy mouse lemur).  Best of all, Jenkins is constantly switching about the perspective in this book.  One moment you're looking at an animal at a sideways angle, and the next minute you're facing down a tiger, head on (and the tiger doesn't seem to be particularly pleased with the interaction).<br /><br />As you may have figured out, my welcome-to-the-library presentation was a smash hit, in no small part due to this wonderful book.  I have high hopes that it may garner itself a heaping helpful of awards in the future.  If you want an educational but highly amusing all at the same time picture book, \\"Actual Size\\" is a must-have.It's beautiful, smartly written, and a joy to thumb through.  Few children can escape its charms.s a must-have.  It's beautiful, smartly written, and a joy to thumb through.  Few children can escape its charms.	2004-12-19
420390:US	49148452	R3C2BKYL00SFYX	0140378251	815348183	The Foundling: and Other Tales of Prydain	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Tales ah-plenty, tales galore	The superstars of children's literature often have to contend with the continual cries of their fans for further adventures and stories.  How long do you think J.K. Rowling will be able to keep her promise of only seven Harry Potter tales before she breaks down and consents to one further story?  We should never forget that when a character (or characters) becomes famous and beloved, he/she/they cannot rest in peace.  Even Sherlock Holmes rose from his grave to star in further adventures and imaginings.  It should come as no surprise then that Lloyd Alexander acquiesced, after a fashion, to his adoring public.  After being asked to writer further tales from the land of Prydain, Alexander chose to give the public what they wanted.  Sort of.  The stories in this book do take place in Prydain and they do contain many of the beloved characters we've grown to know.  In a sly twist, however, Alexander sets all these tales BEFORE any of the action we read about in the Prydain Chronicles.  This experiment in prefacing the stories we already know so well could have ended up as either derivative or as depressing as George Lucas's attempt to create the first three movies of the \\"Star Wars\\" series.  Instead, they end up as tiny parables that speak about hope, light, and beauty in the midst of potential bloodshed and terror.  They're well worth a reading.<br /><br />There are eight stories in this book in total.  The first, \\"The Foundling\\" is the tale of how the sorcerer Dallben was raised by three weird sisters in the midst of a swampy home and gained more wisdom than he wanted.  \\"The Stone\\" shows us the dwarf Doli and his encounter with a man who wants to live forever (and finds it unaccountably dull). \\"The True Enchanter\\" is a kind of how-they-met tale explaining why the princess Eilonwy's mother (who, like all of Alexander's heroines, is exactly like Eilonwy herself) fell for her very unmagical father.  \\"The Rascal Crow\\" is just Alexander's excuse to write his very own Aesop tale about a too-clever crow and his animal allies.  \\"The Sword\\" explains why the sword of Drynwyn met Taran black with blood.  \\"The Smith, the Weaver, and the Harper\\" is another parable, this time displaying the continual greed of man for something a little better.  And finally \\"The Truthful Harp\\" shows how Fflewddur Fflam got his magic harp and how Coll and Dallben met in \\"Coll and His White Pig\\".<br /><br />The stories (as Alexander himself points out in the Author's Note) can be read without having picked up a single Prydain book before.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend doing that though.  How significant is the average reader going to find the fact that King Rhitta died at the hand of his own sword deep in the Spiral Castle if they haven't already picked up \\"The Book of Three\\"?  Or that Dallben grew old before his time?  These stories aren't strictly need-to-know, but it certainly does help.  As for the tales themselves, they're all right.  Nothing too spectacular, if you want my honest opinion.  They take the most basic elements of all good folktales and rework them over and over.  If there's a common theme in any of these stories, it's that all good tales work in threes.  Alexander has reworked them in such a way that they do appear somewhat original, but don't be particularly surprised if you can predict where each story is going long before its close.<br /><br />In the end, this book is really best for those die-hard fans of \\"The Prydain Chronicles\\" who're clamoring for further Lloyd Alexander facts and fancies.  Anyone else will probably find the books a little repetitive and not particularly new.  They're lovely little tales but there's little to recommend them but the books they preface.

421583:US	49148452	R36S6C0792VKQR	1563890410	772511764	The Sandman; vol. 4: Season of Mists	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Hell is a state of mind?  Not so much.	In which our hero reveals that he may not be oh-so invincible after all.  In which he tries to undo a great wrong once performed on an innocent woman.  In which the legions of Hell itself are released into space and Lucifer decides to go into retirement.  And finally, this is a book in which a huge course of events has been begun simply because a brother and a sister have a quarrel.  \\"Season of Mists\\" is the fourth in the collected Sandman chronicles and as such it's an interesting story.  We get to see almost all the Endless siblings gathered together (save one) and we journey from Dreams to Hell and back again.  With this novelette it seems as though Gaiman is beginning to move away from the series' horror-story beginnings into a whole new realm.  It's a refreshing change of scenery.<br /><br />Destiny has called his siblings, Desire, Death, Dream, Delirium (formerly Delight), and Despair together after a visitation by the three sisters (the crone, the maiden, and the matron).  As a result of this meeting, Desire taunts Dream with the fact that he once sentenced an innocent girl to an eternity of Hell simply because she didn't want to stay with him.  Dream is initially angered by this accusation but when Death concurs with the usually malicious Desire, Dream has to face facts.  He has grievously wronged his once beloved Nada.  He anticipates great problems when he returns to Hell to rescue her, but is instead greeted with an empty world. Lucifer himself explains that he's given up the job and as punishment to Dream (who once bested him on his own turf) he gives his guest the key to Hell itself.  Suddenly every mythological god you can think of (Norse, Egyptian, manifestations of order and chaos respectively, etc.) is scrambling to get possession of that key.  Dream can only give it to one group and his beloved Nada is being held as a bargaining chip by one of the factions.  Smart stuff.<br /><br />There are some wonderful mysteries introduced here that we've not seen much of until this time.  For example, there seems to be a missing member of the Endless who, in this collection anyway, remains unnamed.  There are also two infant children born, both of whom have direct ties to the Dream lord.  One is a child of dreams, the other his former lover.  Either good or bad things may come of this.  I enjoyed the fact that characters from previous collections (like Hob, the man who lives forever and the ever malicious Cain with his schlimazel of a sibling Abel) make at least a token appearance in this book.  Gaiman doesn't forget past storylines or people.  It's part of what makes him such an interesting writer.<br /><br />As for the story itself, it's passable.  It does seem a little strange that despite the closeness between Dream and Death, she's only brought up his colossal mistake some ten thousand years after the fact.  But I loved the flow of ideas in this book.  I enjoyed the range of gods that come to feast with Dream and the variety of ways in which they attempt to reason with him.  There's a nice range of different artists in this collection as well, and their skills are honed perfectly with each and every story.  Maybe I found the brief odd tale about the schoolboy in the haunted dormitory a little out of place (why was Death wearing legwarmers?) but if you removed it I fully believe that \\"Season of Mists\\" would be near perfect.<br /><br />Some might call this collection simplistic.  Others might berate it for its scope.  But gol durn it, I like it.  I like almost everything about it.

Hated them with a passion.  Baby dolls especially raised my ire, but fortunately I received relatively few of them.  Like many girls (more than you would think) I was more interested in stuffed animals and, on occasion, trucks and farm equipment toys.  No silly frilly dollies for me, thank you very much.  So I think a five-year-old version of myself would have been the perfect receptacle for Barbara McClintock's wonderful, \\"Dahlia\\".  This is one of those rare books that tries to encourage girls to like dolls, but to do so in their own individual ways.  For the girl-child that eschews the pink delicacy of your average Madame Alexander porcelain creation for rough n' tumble Tonka toys, this book makes an ideal gift.<br /><br />Charlotte leads a great life.  She gets to play outside with her stuffed bear Bruno and make as many mud pies as she would like.  Then, one day, she receives a beautiful doll from her stuffy and elderly Aunt Edme.  Charlotte and Bruno are not at all certain they will like this new doll (christened Dahlia).  They explain to her that she does not belong to a tea-party-frilly-pram girl.  She belongs to a digging-in-dirt-and-climbing-trees girl.  Dahlia accompanies the two as they go about their day and it soon becomes clear that she's enjoying herself.  The three win a wagon race against the local boys, make more mud cupcakes, plant rocks, and climb trees.  And when an overly ambitious Dahlia goes a little further out onto a limb than she should have, Charlotte finds she may really love her little doll after all.<br /><br />The book is set against a Victorian backdrop, a setting that cleverly places Charlotte in that nebulous age where acting like a \\"boy\\" wasn't frowned on yet.  The story itself is great.  The more outdoor activities Dahlia partakes of, the happier she appears.  McClintock took care to give her inanimate characters just the slightest hint of life as well.  Bruno and Dahlia never seem to move of their own accord, but their facial expressions do tend to change ever-so-slightly from scene to scene.  I loved the delicate pen and inks that illustrated this book as well.  McClintock shades and details each and every picture in this story with loving intricacy.  These pictures draw you into them, giving you the chance to search them through for hidden secrets and minutia.  The colors are muted, but rather than making the book ladylike and wan, it makes the book appear to be wholly in its own little world.  And a beautiful little world it is too.<br /><br />And of course, I love the story.  Who wouldn't?  Everybody wins here.  For those stodgy individuals amongst us who believe that all little girls should play with dolls, here's a book that justifies that sentiment.  For people who like books in which girls break out of traditional stereotypes regarding what they should play with and how, this book also fulfills a need.  It has something for everyone, yet remains a deeply touching and unique work.  \\"Dahlia\\" is a great treat for young and old alike.

Well, in my humble opinion, a good picture book is the kind where you read through it, enjoy it, then glance at the copyright page and shriek with befuddlement when you realize that the original text was written waaaay way back in 1978.  The year of this reviewer's humble birth.  This fact is so amazingly shocking because \\"Don't Forget to Come Back\\" is a book that feels ultra-hip on top of being ultra-modern.  Chalk that feeling up to the amazing illustrations by preeminent illustrator Harry Bliss.  Choosing to help kids cut through the fears that overtake them when their parents go out for a night, this book is an excellent resource for any parent with a particularly clingy young `un on a Saturday night.<br /><br />Our young protagonist informs us right off the bat that she is aware that her father and mother are going out for the night.  Her reaction?  \\"I didn't like that one bit!\\".  As a result she tries every trick in her bag to keep her parents in the home.  She points out that since she is not a baby she does not need a \\"baby\\" sitter.  When that doesn't work she tries a different tactic.  If the parents leave a thunderstorm will blow the house down, she'll throw up, and she'll be eaten by a moose (not necessarily in that order).  She then attempts to come along, persuade just one parent to stay, threaten unending not-niceness, run away from home via the closet, etc.  Of course, she likes her babysitter (which helps) and so she admonishes her parents with the title phrase, \\"Don't forget to come back!\\".  In the morning, when she wakes, there they are in bed safe and sound.  And not a single moose ate her either.<br /><br />When I first read this book glancingly (is that a word?) I wasn't particularly impressed.  Something about the parents' hoity-toity digs kinda threw me for a mild loop.  On a closer rereading, however, I was charmed.  Throughout the heroine's various cajoleries and dire warnings the parents have the distinct look of people who've heard it all before.  They're not disinterested, necessarily.  Just well-aware of the battle that takes place every time they want to go out for a night.  Illustrator Harry Bliss gives them patient albeit dressing-for-the-night attitudes towards their only child.  And I loved the babysitter.  She's a great companion to the kid, acting as silly or semi-serious as called for.  The best image in the whole book is that of the girl asleep in her bed wearing a clown face while the sitter, in a matching clown face, reads to her from a monster book sporting Lon Chaney's \\"Phantom\\" mug.  You have to see it yourself to get the full flavor.<br /><br />Writer Robie H. Harris is one of those speakers who presents on topics like, \\"Writing About the Powerful Feelings and Real Concerns of Young Children\\".  I don't know if she was aware of the form her book would take when she originally wrote it in 1978.  In a novel twist, the book is rife with speech bubbles.  This gives it a particularly contemporary air and makes it a very visually interesting piece.  It's not a graphic novel for kids or anything.  Just an original presentation of material that could have been rather dull and isn't.<br /><br />Many many children freak out over the idea that their parents won't be coming back from their nighttime rendezvous.  And many many picture books have broken their backs trying to cash in on reassuring these kids' fears.  \\"Don't Forget to Come Back\\" does it in such a way that it's amusing to both children and adults alike.  For a wry picture book that knows just how much slack to give kids (without sacrificing their point of view) this little number is an ideal choice.

Now it is a very difficult thing to write a heartfelt children's book full of magic, life, and light.  Few books have ever pulled off this combination well, usually ending up too sticky sweet or just unbelievable overall.  One of these rare exceptions is the rather good, \\"Because of Winn-Dixie\\" by Kate DiCamillo.  It's no coincidence, therefore, that Katherine Hannigan's pale copy of \\"Winn-Dixie\\" earned itself a DiCamillo recommendation on its cover.  \\"Ida B\\" is many things in this world but it would be difficult to call it good.  Reading it is rather like hanging out with a person who keeps trying to make you happy but only succeeds in getting you increasingly annoyed.  It's a vaguely painful experience.<br /><br />Ida B has the perfect life.  She lives with her mama and daddy on a land containing sprawling acres.  She has her own brook, apple orchard, and mountain (which is to say, a mound of earth too tall to be considered a hill).  Life is pretty good for little Ida B.  That is, until troubles come.  These troubles are in the form of Ida's mama coming down with cancer.  The cost of the treatments means some of the land must be sold and that her mother is now sick and tired all the time.  Worst of all, however, is the fact that Ida B's father just doesn't have time to homeschool his daughter anymore and her mother's too exhausted.  Faced with the torment of attending public school, Ida B rebels every way she can think of, shutting down her heart to any and all comers.  It's only through the intervention of the good people around her that she can learn to open up and feel once more, while remaining true to her own sweet self.<br /><br />It's hard to pinpoint the exact moment this book lost me.  First of all, it's written in a very particular vernacular that echoes \\"Because of Winn-Dixie\\" pound for pound.  As we soon learn, Ida B is in fourth grade.  Just the same, she's prone to statements like, \\"Mama, this will not do\\", and \\"I have a desperate need that must be taken care of immediately\\".  I could probably believe she's some sort of child prodigy prone to such statements.  Unfortunately, her method of speaking is rife with continual attempts to charm the reader while offering tidbits of childlike wisdom.  If there is one sin I cannot forgive a book for, it is the sin of expressing syrupy Prescious-Moments type faux adorableness.  Author Hannigan takes moments that, if done well, could be very touching and instead whops you over the head with a truckload of cutesy-pie platitudes.  A good example of this is when Ida B goes walking with her father and he says, \\"We are the earth's caretakers\\" and she replies \\"I think the earth takes care of us too\\".  oog.  This book is trying desperately to win your heart and mind.  Instead, it leaves you with a slightly sour taste in your mouth.<br /><br />Worse still is the main character Ida B.  Now, here we have a child that's been homeschooled since she decided that Kindergarten was not for her.  She's lived a carefree existence playing in nature, talking to trees, and doing pretty much whatever she wants.  When her mother comes down with cancer, you feel bad for her.  Who wouldn't?  Poor little kid.  Ida B, however, doesn't really care much for what her mother and father are going through.  All she cares about is the fact that her father has sold some of their land and that she has to go BACK to school.  So she decides to become the most awful person imaginable.  For most of this book we watch evil little Ida B attempting to make everyone who loves her, miserable.  And she succeeds brilliantly.  As a result, the book is either attempting to woo you with its half-penny wisdom or it's asking you to sympathize with its self-absorbed heroine.  How far can you really identify with a child that can look at her mother, bald from radiation treatments, and feel nothing but self-pity for herself?  Ugh.<br /><br />To sum up: The book is a pale rip-off of a better written novel.  It tries to be cute and fails.  It tries to be wise and fails.  It's heroine is concerned only with her own needs and never gives half as much thought and attention into caring for the people around her (preferring instead to talk to trees).  \\"Ida B\\" is author Katherine Hannigan's first novel.  I'm not sure how I feel about that.  Certainly if she stopped trying too hard to make her heroine likable she might come up with some truly interesting writing.  As it is, this book falls short of the mark.  It is not particularly good and it is not particularly well-written.  If you want a book that touches you, read or reread, \\"Because of Winn-Dixie\\".  If you want a book that goes for cheap emotions and doesn't even have much of a payoff at its end, go on and read, \\"Ida B\\".  I suspect that someday Hannigan will write a great book.

No real appreciation for Keystone Cop references (bet you didn't see THAT one coming).  In the old days a child could take one look at a round headed bumbling policeman and immediately understand why that image was so freakin' hilarious.  Today, no such luck.  Fortunately there are books out there like, \\"Buz\\" by Richard Egielski to alleviate such cares and woes.  A raucous romp that follows a single bug and his misadventures inside an average boy, it's a fun little story with a whole lotta pep.  It's not the greatest source of factual information regarding the human body, but it's still worth a look-see and a read-aloud.<br /><br />Buz is not having a good day.  He's just been devoured along with some cornflakes by a boy and has found himself trapped in the boy's body.  After a quick visit to the doctor, the kid learns that he does indeed have a bug.  Enter in two pills, charged with removing Buz from the body.  That's where the Keystone Cop references enter in.  Buz manages to elude his tormentors until finally escaping while the boy takes a bath.  This leaves Buz with a cold of his very own and a fellow insect doctor tells him he has a germ.  The last image in the book is of that very germ staring out of one of Buz's eyes with a look of trapped panic.  The end!<br /><br />Author/illustrator Richard Egielski is probably best known in chatty children's circles for his Caldecott winning book, \\"Hey, Al\\", which he illustrated for.  \\"Buz\\" marks his foray into the wild uncouth world of artists who are also authors.  As it is, the story is all well and good.  There's no getting around the point, of course, that kids reading this book might acquire some fairly screwy ideas of how the body fits together.  Buz spends a portion of the book standing on the other side of the boy's eye, watching the world through the kid's iris.  Also, he finds it moderately simple to swim out of the child's ear.  And there is of course the fact that the doctor says the boy has a bug when, in fact, he means that literally.  Telling a kid, after reading \\"Buz\\", that they have a bug of some sort may give them odd ideas of what that actually means.  FYI.<br /><br />These are fairly petty concerns, of course.  I mean, the book's really quite good.  While I found Egielski's illustrations verging on the disturbing in \\"Hey, Al\\", here I liked `em just fine.  Whether you're watching flying cornchips whizzing past Buz's head in the boy's mouth or enjoying a tug of war between the two pills when they finally grab ahold of Buz, everything in this book is clear and beautifully rendered.  There's a cleanliness to the lines here that's pleasant to look at and easy to understand if you're a child.  Egielski also has a good sense of narrative flow, making his first attempt at writing a picture book well done.<br /><br />I know you probably have your own bug-gets-trapped-in-a-child's-body picture book favorites of your own, but I think you should at least give \\"Buz\\" a try.  It's wacky good-natured chase em' down fun.  A nice combination of slapstick comedy and surreal interior adventures.

Konigsburg gets older, the children in her novels become less recognizably childlike and more increasingly adult\\".  Then I rethought that little statement.  It's unfair to say that Konigsburg has only recently made her children miniature adults.  After all, she's been doing it from the start.  Pick up, \\"From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler\\", and you'll note that even back in 1967 Konigsburg's characters were more inclined to sigh and utter striking notes of middle-class ennui than do something particularly childlike like read comic books or chew bubble gum.  \\"The Outcasts of 19 Schuyler Place\\" is just the latest in a long line of adult-like kids in adult situations acting like adults (but short ones with fewer rights and no driving licenses).  It's a fun book.  An amusing adventure that draws on several different storylines and brings them all together effortlessly by the story's close.  And it is undoubtedly the most grown-up of Konigsburg's books to date.  Whether that hurts the story or not is up to you.<br /><br />Margaret Rose has suffered a nasty shock.  Her beloved Hungerian uncles have not, to her amazement, offered to take her in for the summer while her parents go on an archeological dig.  That means she's stuck at summer camp in a cabin with some particularly malicious girls.  In a normal children's book, this would mean that our heroine would spend the rest of the novel either outwitting her enemies or avoiding them.  Instead, Margaret is saved after a mere two weeks of camp by her aforementioned uncles.  Ensconced at their home on 19 Schuyler Place the girl usually takes a great deal of pleasure in viewing and painting her uncles' three magnificent ridiculous towers of glass and steel.  Soon, however, it becomes clear why the uncles didn't offer to take in Margaret Rose from the start.  It seems the local neighborhood association has insisted that the towers are unsafe, gaudy, and lower property values.  Soon they will be coming down and unless Margaret Rose can come up with a plan, three beautiful things may soon be destroyed.<br /><br />The book is set in the 1980s, making it perhaps one of the first works of historical 1980s children's fiction I've ever encountered.  Characters in the story are smart and well-formed.  Konigsburg's ear for dialogue stands her in good stead here with the amusing running arguments between the two uncles.  Other characters include Mrs. Kaplan who rules the camp at which Margaret Rose briefly stays and is simultaneously pitiable and (not to put too fine a point on it) a spiritual twin of Nurse Ratchet in \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\".  Mrs. Kaplan's son, Jake, is a fellow who previously gave up on his dreams and is only now slowly coming around to living his own life, via the towers.  And then there's Margaret Rose.<br /><br />Alas poor Margaret Rose.  This is a twelve-year-old girl prone to making statements along the lines of, \\"I prefer not to\\" ala Bartleby the Scrivener.  When asked why she has rejected the camp's half-hearted attempts to befriend her, Margaret Rose replies, \\"Because you are destroying my self-image\\".  Please... please anyone... please locate the twelve-year-old out there that bandies about the phrase, \\"self-image\\" when they're talking about their problems.  I'm not saying that there isn't a rare child here and there who might take an odd pleasure in such terms, but in Konigsburg's books they're a dime a dozen.  Which makes Margaret Rose a weak carbon copy of many of the characters Konigsburg has written about before.<br /><br />None of this is to say that the book doesn't make for good reading.  I'm just not certain how interested kids would be in Home Owner Associations and the recorded public records of city council meetings.  The author is at her best when she talks about the uncles and their towers.  Like the towers in fellow children's book, \\"The Wind Singer\\" by William Nicholson (a great and under-read book), these structures create an eerie beautiful music when the time is right.  Like the towers in J.R.R. Tolkein's, \\"The Two Towers\\" they conjure up majesty and great power.  They are the focal point of this book, and a wonderful one at that.<br /><br />As you've undoubtedly caught on to, I'm not exactly running for the Greatest Konigsburg Fan nomination at this time.  I like her work in general, but her specific books sometimes rub me the wrong way.  \\"The Outcasts of 19 Schuyler Place\\" has a lot going for it.  And if you get around the political elements (and some odd moments regarding Margeret Rose's mom's childhood friends) the book is a fairly fun read for your average 6th grader.

431797:US	49148452	RPIOGAT57OJWH	0395148065	198236282	The Biggest Bear	Books	5	42	45	N	N	Oh sure it LOOKS cute and cuddly...	In the November/December 2004 issue of Horn Book Magazine (a title that discusses children's literature with aplomb) there was an article in which an author sobbed at the lack of positive hunting images in picture books and children's novels.  I thought through this argument, but since I don't really come from a rural hunting family myself, I guess I never considered this to be a bad thing.  Thoughts of this nature surfaced yet again when I picked up Lynd Ward's 1952 Caldecott winning picture book, \\"The Biggest Bear\\".  A surprisingly sly cautionary tale about the dangers that accompany removing wild animals from their habitats, the book definitely shows a hunting happy family in a positive light.  Fortunately, it also considers the consequences that come when you set off to kill something for no reason.<br /><br />Johnny Orchard's deeply ashamed.  Take a look at any barn in the urrounding area and what do you find?  A bearhide hanging on its side.  Take a look at the Orchard's barn and what do you find there?  Nuthin'.  While Johnny listens with awe to the tales other men tell of finding and killing bears, his own grandfather ADMITS that on the one occasion he saw a bear he ran as fast as his legs could carry him away from it.  Taking matters into his own hands, little Johnny picks up his gun and goes into the forest to kill the biggest bear he can find.  As it turns out, the biggest bear he can find is not very big at all.  Just a baby.  With new eyes Johnny adopts the cuddly furball and takes it into his home.  Before long, however, it becomes clear that this is not a bear that is meant to live in a home and Johnny must make the ultimate sacrifice to keep it away.<br /><br />I'll give away a little of the ending here so as to put your mind at rest.  No, Johnny does not pull an \\"Old Yeller\\" on his fuzzy companion. He tries to though.  Fortunately he's stopped at the last minute and the bear is taken to a zoo to live.  Happy ending for all, despite the fact that we're talking about 1950s type tiny-zoos.  This is an excellent book for any kid that has ever wanted to have an inappropriate pet of their very own, whether it be wild baby raccoons, rabbits, bears, or foxes.  The story shows how domesticated animals can be more trouble than they're worth.... especially bears.<br /><br />So Ward's book has a clear cut message and a delightful narrative voice.  And how're the pictures?  Well, they're top notch.  Drawn entirely in black and white (with undulating shades of gray around the shadows and details) the pictures in this story are too lifelike to be called cartoony and too cartoony to be called lifelike.  Plus, the action sequences in this tale are realistic enough to convince you of their fast pace.  Personally, I was most impressed by the facial expressions of the bear.  I don't want to give you the impression that Mr. Ward has done anything but make this bear appear vividly bear-like.  Still, sometimes the animal gets looks in his eyes that strike you as funny.  There's a part where Johnny has attempted to free the bear, only to find it in his backyard a day or two later.  In one of these instances the bear appears behind a row of pigs who're poised over a slops trough.  The pigs look disgruntled and a little worried that their food is about to be taken from them.  The bear, on his part, has a world-weary expression of an animal that could patiently wait for food forever.  I place it amongst one of the greatest picture book illustrations in the history of the form.<br /><br />Unlike other old-timey Caldecott winners like \\"Make Way For Ducklings\\" or \\"The Snowy Day\\", \\"The Biggest Bear\\" has been mostly forgotten.  This is a real shame since it's a truly interesting story that has a lot to say to us, even today.  It's not flashy and colorful and it's method of spinning a tale won't knock your socks off.  It's just a really enjoyable story about a boy, his bear, and taking responsibility for your actions. A great tale to this very day.le to this very day.	2004-12-07

Sometimes this can be a good thing, like when a book draws a subway stop incorrectly or fails to acknowledge the correct placement of the Central Park Mall.  Other times, it's a handicap.  The New York Public Library's 2004 list of 100 Picture Books Everyone Should Know included Bryan Collier's 2000 ode to Harlem, \\"Uptown\\".  Upon reading through it, I wondered why anyone would concentrate a picture book on such a specific area.  What interest could this possibly hold for kids living in, oh say, Iowa or Nebraska?  How could the author be so vain as to think that by zeroing in on a neighborhood, others would understand why it's important?  Then I took a step back.  I remembered that there are hundreds of books that do what \\"Uptown\\" has done.  They define a neighborhood, a block, a city, or even a nation so that the children reading the book will be transported to entirely new geographical locations.  If I lived anywhere else BUT New York I would have instantly recognized the charms of \\"Uptown\\" upon first setting eyes on it.  Fortunately, I've mended my ways and can tell you truly that for a spot on description of a unique cultural place and time, Bryan Collier has Harlem's number.<br /><br />Our narrator is a young boy who knows Uptown like the back of his hand.  In his words we hear all the different things that he identifies with his home.  Uptown is everything from chicken with waffles to barbershops filled with men in hats.  There's jazz and weekend shopping on 125th street.  There's girls wearing identical outfits on their way to church and \\"the orange sunset over the Hudson River\\".  Finally, when all is said and done, there's just one thing the boy can truly say about this world.  \\"Uptown is Harlem... Harlem world, my world. Uptown is home\\".<br /><br />Using a hodge podge of mixed media in the form of watercolors and collages, Collier makes an array of complicated and highly detailed images out of fabrics and photographs.  The brownstones that line the streets (described, deliciously, in a sentence that compares them to chocolate) are complex combinations of images that blend seamlessly with the rest of the book.  Our hero has a very cool attitude about him too.  Sometimes he's sitting on a chair eyeing photographs of his grandparents' wedding day.  Sometimes he's shooting hoops.  Sometimes he's just sitting listening to the Harlem Boy's Choir.  Whatever the case, as long as you're in his presence you know he has a handle on every situation.  This narrator is, ultimately, a reliable one.  Surrounded by an organized muddle of straight and crazy images, you know he's at home in this raucous wonderful city.<br /><br />Kids will like this book.  Whether you're a Midwestern suburban homeowner, a Texan working the fields, or an L.A. sun worshipper, this book will still speak to you.  It doesn't matter if you've never even set foot in New York City.  It doesn't matter if you've, until this moment, avoided reading books about cities to your kids because you think they'll be confused by them.  Regardless of your situation in life, \\"Uptown\\" will still speak to you and touch you in some way.  This is a book about belonging to a culture of like-minded individuals.

437686:US	49148452	R3H8C905IU6KW5	0140507299	998500671	The Glorious Flight: Across the Channel with Louis Bleriot July 25, 1909 (Picture Puffin Books)	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Flight of the Frenchman	Alice and Martin Provensen certainly had a good run in the early 1980s.  First there was their Newberry-winning-Caldecott-Honor-attaining, \\"A Visit to William Blake's Inn\\" (which I'm not a fan, but oh well) and then their very own Caldecott winning, \\"The Glorious Flight\\".  If you were randomly scanning the shelves of your local library and you stumbled upon this book, you might consider it an early picture book.  The story's muted color schemes and simple characters give it a particularly classic feel, unlike anything else you might find in contemporary tales.  This may not be THE most exciting book in the world (the Provensens excel in moods and tones rather than fast-paced adrenaline rushes) but there is a lovely feel to it that outweighs its occasional lapses into deadened flatness.<br /><br />Voila, Monsieur Louis Bleriot (who, for purposes that remain unclear, is referred to here as a very un-French \\"Mr.\\").  A well-to-do man of France in 1901, Bleriot lives a contented existence with his spouse, five children, cat, dog, and cockatoo.  Just your average bourgeoisie.  All that changes one day when up above the city streets Bleriot spots a remarkable new invention.  It's a great white airship circling the skies.  Suddenly, much like Toad in \\"Wind in the Willows\\", Bleriot is entranced and mesmerized by the contraption.  Says our hero, \\"I, too, will build a flying machine\\".  The book chronicles his various attempts, each growing more sophisticated as Bleriot himself grows more learned.  Finally, he enters a contest to be the first man to fly across the English Channel and, after some tense moments, succeeds and wins.  Says the text, \\"Truly, it was a glorious flight\\".<br /><br />Indeed.  It's a nice story too.  In many of their books, the Provenses' style strikes the reader as a bit lacking in basic human emotions and warmth.  In this case, however, it works perfectly within the text.  The illustrations in this story are like old posed family portraits, only with a twinge more life and verve to them.  The colors are, as I said before, muted.  Yet somehow this doesn't bore the reader or even so much as put them to sleep.  I think this may have something to do with the fact that this book, in the end, is a biography of sorts.  Based on true events, the unnatural style and shades fit better than over-the-top bright/gaudy colors ever could have.<br /><br />It's somewhat backhanded praise, but praise just the same when I say that in spite of my deep down dislike of the Provensens' other books, I could not help but like, \\"The Glorious Flight\\".  It really isn't going to deeply capture the attention of any children but those interested in history, France, or flying machines.  A nice story that somehow garnered itself a Caldecott Award.

After some considerations of this awful possibility the child you speak to may have a newfound appreciation for something he or she has always taken for granted before.  But where does electricity really come from?  How is it made?  Author/illustrator Molly Bang has made a graceful departure from her adorable fiction based picture books into that nebulous territory known as non-fiction.  \\"My Light\\" shows the myriad ways in which our own dear Sun has created (either directly or indirectly) the energy we use in our very light bulbs.<br /><br />Says the Sun at the beginning of the book, \\"When you see the city lights at night, they look like stars have fallen down to earth\\".  That, the sun points out, is a pretty smart assessment.  After all, the Sun is a star and almost all the electric light in the world began with it.  To explain how this works we are privy to various displays of energy, transferred to earth in multiple ways.  One section discusses how the sun causes water to evaporate, rain, fall into rivers, and eventually operate the dams that create energy via generators.  Too complex an idea?  What about the fact that the sun causes warm air to rise so that cooler air operates the giant electric turbines of the world?  And don't forget that coal was once living trees that needed the sun for their growth.  Heck, solar power itself is explored in this book too, giving kids a clear vision of solar cells.  Tying together the theme of continually shifting energy, the book ends by pointing out that all light, even electric ones, eventually fade back into space in some way.  The back of the book contains additional information about the various topics touched on, giving more details on the various types of electricity available to us.  It is here that Bang mentions that in her original conception of this book she had some many notes that they, \\"started turning into an encyclopedia\\".  For kids doing science projects on electricity, Bang suggests that see these notes on her website at [...]  Bang is to commended for these sections, if only because she offers ample explanations about which forms of energy are pollutants and which ones aren't.<br /><br />Moreover, you cannot say that Bang hasn't covered her bases in this book.  Her facts, as presented in the text, are clear and easy for kids to understand.  The book is also the author's most beautiful to date.  Much like fellow author/illustrator Peter Sis, Bang has adopted a style of art that works perfectly within the context of her tale.  The sun emits thousands of tiny yellow dots, all representing the energy that floats across space and to the Earth itself.  By watching these yellow dots of energy, kids have a clear image of how they are transferred from the sun, to the water, to the rain, to the river, and finally into electricity itself.  Bang's generators glow with remarkable beauty all the while remaining scientifically accurate.  Whether she's showing the intricate details in the cell structure of a plant leaf or displaying the methods by which coal-fired electricity \\"flows in copper wires\\", the book is immensely interesting.<br /><br />Some of Bang's books in the past, while good, have a messy edge to them.  Don't get me wrong... I'm a huge fan of her \\"Ten, Nine, Eight\\", as well as \\"When Sophie Gets Angry - Really, Really Angry..\\".  But those picture books were always just flirting with Bang's slapdash painting style.  Here, in \\"My Light\\", she's eschewed that school of art for a book that's very tightly reined in.  The lines here are clear and straight.  Her towns are realistically rendered and I've yet to see a book that displays a night-time cityscape from above any better than she does here.  With the aid of unknown thousands of tiny dots, Bang has (in my mind anyway) graduated from merelyokay picture books to spectacularly good ones.  If you're looking for a book that is scientific but also deeply beautiful (and factual too, for what it counts) this is your best bet.  I can't push it into your arms fast enough.

Tons of these puppies come out every year.  Sometimes they appeal to only certain demographics (like the racecar alphabet books, for example).  Sometimes they're incredibly hip and modern and hold zippo interest for the children that they are (supposedly) intended for.  Sometimes they're deathly dull affairs that offer nothing new or brilliant and sometimes they're so packed with brilliance that it's difficult to remember what the book's initial importance was in the first place.  Step back in time then and view the 1960 creation, \\"Bruno Munari's ABC\\".  Created by an author/illustrator that, \\"began his career by exhibiting with the second Futurist movement\\" in Italy (or so his bookflap says), Munari was an excellent graphic designer in his day.  And he gave the world this ABC book, one that remains so incredibly popular that it has appeared on the New York Public Library's \\"100 Pictur Books Everyone Should Know\\" for 2004.  It's a thick sturdy affair, with pages that would take more than the mere strength of toddlers to tear.  More importantly, in spite of its very basic design and concept (showing objects that begin with each letter presented) it remains beautiful to look at and interesting to read.<br /><br />Your first image in this book is of a luscious orange/red apple sitting in a white space.  On its stem crawls a realistically rendered black ant with the only words on the page, \\"an Ant on an Apple\\".  Then you turn the page to a full double spread of a brilliant Blue Butterfly.  It's a deep royal blue, but of a shade that brings to mind deep pockets of the ocean and long shadows late in the day.  Munari uses watercolors to their fullest in this book.  A careful reading through each page displays objects on white with simple words and recognizable objects.  To my mind, the only object here that struck me as a little out of date was the rendering of an old rotary-dial telephone.  And in any case I sincerely doubt that your kids will find it unrecognizable.  Munari has also included in this book a small fly that breaks out of its own F page to buzz into other interesting shots.  There is a mild understated commentary that remarks on this.  When, for example, the fly alights on a pink ribboned hat that may soon be crushed by a hammer, the commentary gasps, \\"look out, fly!\\".<br /><br />It's the range of colors in this book that really let it stand out though.  Whether you're viewing a purple violin, the pink flesh of a watermelon, the brown of an owl, or the green of a leaf, the book is a visual cacophony of shades and images.  There's something about Munari's sparse style that continues to appeal, even to this day.  If you want alphabet books that blow you away with their wit and wonder, they exist I assure you.  There are probably tons of them out there that seek to impress far more than this creation.  But if you want something classic and classy that teaches the alphabet without distracting or obliterating its original message (which is to say, teaching the alphabet in the first place) then \\"Bruno Munari's ABC\\" should be a first choice.ase I sincerely doubt that your kids will find it unrecognizable.

442768:US	49148452	R3J7DNEQTV9ZDF	0060237384	882083706	Children of the dust	Books	4	8	10	N	N	It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine	Is it naïve of me to say that I usually go into a post-apocalyptic children's book with the vague hope of not encountering anything TOO depressing?  Take Louise Lawrence's 1985 still-memorable hit, \\"Children of the Dust\\", for example.  Now, I've read many many books in which the world has been hit by a plague/atomic bomb/alien invasion and our heroes must strive to adapt to an entirely new environment.  However, my reaction to the first tale in this book (there are three, all woven together) was that the start of this story is dark, depressing, and woeful.  I had a great deal of difficulty plowing through each page in an effort to reach the book's end.  To my surprise, the final story made this slog well worth it.  Therefore I tell you here and now that if you'd like to read \\"Children of the Dust\\" yet find yourself unaccountably depressed by the first tale in the book, keep going.  It improves radically after a point.<br /><br />The world has been covered in radiation.  With war breaking out all over the world, fourteen-year-old Sarah discovers that she must care for her stepmother and step-siblings in their ramshackle home.  In time, it becomes clear that while most of the family is dying of radiation sickness in one form or another, stepsister Catherine has taken the best precautions and is likely to survive the holocaust.  To this end, Catherine is delivered into the home of a man who is able to care for her and protect her from the radiated world as Sarah and the remaining family members perish.  In story number two, a bunker in England has also survived in which Catherine's father lives.  He fathers young Ophelia, a child who cannot accept that the world outside her bunker is so harsh.  Finally, in the final story we meet Ophelia's son Simon.  The bunker has collapsed and Simon finds that the remaining humans in the world have mutated to adapt to harsh environmental conditions.  Finding these mutants to be freaks, Simon initially rejects the new world.  Only in time does he come to accept the changes and to see himself as less of a dinosaur and more a man who can make a difference in the lands of the children of the dust.<br /><br />So there are a couple problems with this book, which I'll mention point blank.  First of all, I doubt mutations in human beings could mutate and adapt to a world with increased radiation and zippo ozone layers in a single generation.  Also, I think radiation can penetrate blankets and trash bags (which Sarah uses to protect Catherine).  These small factual quibbles aside, the first story in this book entitled \\"Sarah\\" is awful.  Really really painful to get through.  After having read the whole book I can see why it was included... sort of.  We need to establish the horrors of war and the trials taken to ensure Catherine's survival.  Still, the second story \\"Ophelia\\" didn't seem much better.  Again, it was interesting but deeply depressing.  \\"Simon\\" on the other hand was great.  Top notch.  Had I edited this puppy I probably would have suggested to Louise Lawrence that she expand \\"Simon\\" and skip writing \\"Sarah\\" and \\"Ophelia\\" in the first place.  Nonetheless, the books stand strongly all together.  They are small testaments to human courage and the capacity we have for survival.<br /><br />Credit where credit is due, this book is heads and tails better than more recent stories with grossly similar plots.  I am thinking of \\"Hole In the Sky\\" by Pete Hautman.  Both books involve most of the world's population dying in a plague/nuclear holocaust.  In both cases there are mutated survivors.  But while \\"Hole In the Sky\\" sees these mutants as insane zombies destined to destroy humanity as we know it, \\"Children of the Dust\\" is far more optimistic and (frankly) realistic in some senses.  In her book, humans have learned from their mistakes.  The future utopia is one in which humans live in a generalized communist/socialist society where energy is created through safe environmentally-friendly means.  Weapons of any sort are frowned upon, which actually renders humanity stronger, and not weaker, without them.  It's a portrait in which people like you and I are extinct, but the world is a better place as a result.<br /><br />So in the canon of futuristic post-war children's books, this one certainly deserves to be remembered.  Perhaps it's a little dour here and there.  Honestly, with the swearing and references to sex (though in a scientific breeding kind of way) this is probably a story most appropriate for a pre-teen.  There's also a bit of God-talk in the first story.  I don't know what your own personal religious proclivities may be, but if you're uncomfortable with a book that contains some Christian quotations here and there, know that \\"Sarah\\" contains them tenfold.  Otherwise, an interesting book that I recommend fully if not whole-heartedly.means.  Weapons of any sort are frowned upon, which actually renders humanity stronger, and not weaker, without them.

445689:US	49148452	R1J7YPL9S4EDS0	0395353939	170575532	The Mysteries of Harris Burdick	Books	5	93	94	N	N	Curiouser and curiouser	Picture books have a wide range of purposes in this world.  They can teach and inform.  They can amuse and entertain.  Sometimes, though, I think that the most impressive picture books are the ones that inspire.  And not in a gosh-doesn't-that-drawing-of-a-sunset-make-you-want-to-draw-a-sunset-too type mentality.  I mean true inspiration.  The kind you might find, for example, in Chris Van Allsburg's incredibly entertaining and mysterious picture book, \\"The Mysteries of Harris Burdick\\".  I can think of no other source in this world better able to inspire children to write their own highly interesting stories.  \\"The Mysteries of Harris Burdick\\" has been used for years as a uniquely original source for stirring up potential tales in the minds of kids everywhere.  More importantly, though, it's just a darn good book.  Darn good!<br /><br />Few books for small children actively encourage you to read a long wordy Introduction to them first.  This is one of the few.  Before we see any of the pictures we are told a tale of one Mr. Wenders and one Mr. Burdick.  Mr. Wenders was once a children's book publisher.  As he was sitting in his office one day a Mr. Harris Burdick arrived with fourteen illustrations.  It seems that Mr. Burdick had written fourteen stories and he had brought an illustration from each of these for the perusal of Mr. Wenders.  After dropping off the pictures (each with its own title and line from the book it belonged to) he left and was never seen again.  This book is a presentation of those mysterious images, all suggesting that they belong to magical stories of their own.  The introductory story, I should probably point out, is utterly false.  But it gives some nice context to the images that follow and hopefully kids will still dig them.<br /><br />If you've ever read \\"Jumanji\\" or \\"Polar Express\\" then you are familiar with Van Allsburg's style of mysterious eerily realistic drawings.  All pictures in this particular book are in black and white, but they each seem just a little too real to be completely fantastical.  Some pictures are sublime.  There's an especially amusing one that displays a nun flying above two men in what looks to be a cathedral.  The title of the print is, \\"The Seven Chairs\\" and the accompanying quote reads, \\"The fifth one ended up in France\\".  Other pictures in the book vary in creepiness and wonder.  There's a picture of a man attempting to beat something large under his carpet with a nearby chair.  Another illustration a house lifting off into space.  Another shows a woman lowering a knife to a pumpkin as it glows like a brightly lit luminary.<br /><br />The advantage of this book is that as kids page through it, they feel the need to tell the rest of the stories they see presented here.  If a kid looks at the picture of a boy being abducted by a ship's captain they may wish to write a tale of adventure and derring-do on the high seas.  Consequently, each tale told here can be interpreted a variety of different ways.  I don't want to make this book sound as if it's sole purpose is as a method of teaching writing exercises.  I just want to point out that it's so lovely a collection of images that I think anyone that reads it will be pleased by what they see.  Pleased to the point of extravagant imaginings, in some cases.<br /><br />Every Chris Van Allsburg book contains some sort of deeply mysterious tone to it.  He's the kind of illustrator that causes great love and adoration in his fans.  \\"The Mysteries of Harris Burdick\\" is not your normal run-of-the-mill type picture book.  And if you're looking for something to read your five-year-old to sleep with, look elsewhere.  You will not find anything here that will interest them.  What you will find instead is a book like no other.  One of my favorite picture books, even at the grand old age of 26., but they each seem just a little too real to be completely fantastical.

To my credit, I never had any real reason to until now.  The only Raymond Briggs creation with which I was familiar was his seemingly ubiquitous picture book entitled, \\"The Snowman\\".  I'm sure you've seen it. Published the same year as my birth that doggone story always depressed me as a little kid.  I never really saw the point of it all.  Boy makes snowman. Snowman befriends boy.  Snowman dies a horrible melty death at the end.  Ugh.  But hold that thought!  \\"Ug\\" was just the storybook to rescue me from my unhealthy anti-Briggs mentality.  With the discovery of \\"Ug: Boy Genius of the Stone Age\\", I've come to the slow realization that perhaps Mr. Briggs does not begin and end with \\"The Snowman\\".  In this odd little book that seemingly draws on everything from Winsor McCay to the far more contemporary Chris Ware (there's more than a drop of \\"Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Boy On Earth\\" here) we meet a kid who yearns for nothing more than a comfy pair of trou.<br /><br />Ug lives with his ma and pa (Dugs and Dug, respectively) in the Stone Age.  Ug is a bit saddened by the fact that his pants are completely made out of stone.  He keeps believing that there must be something better out there.  Pants that are softer than sandstone.  Food that doesn't have to be eaten raw.  Homes that are not caves.  The more Ug dreams, the more his mother attempts to squash his resolve.  And when, at long last, he and his father seem to be on the right path, a lack of certain tools bars their final triumph.<br /><br />The book is written more like a graphic novel than a picture book.  Here we have voice bubbles and the occasional footnote.  I've probably never seen a picture book that used the word, \\"anachronism\\" more often than this puppy.  The book is undoubtedly odd, there's no question.  Briggs has an odd off-kilter sense of humor that serves him quite nobly in this endeavor.  It's certainly a book for older children, though.  And it occurs to me that books such as this are just begging for squeamish adults to get angry about.  The mom walks about without a shirt (it's really not that noticeable, but some people might object).  The fam eats raw meat with bloody regularity.  And then there's the rather depressing final picture in the tale.  Kids yearning for a vindicated Ug to prove to the world that he's right will take no comfort in the image of our now adult hero cave painting above the graves of his parents.  But then, Briggs has always sorta been a fan of the letdown ending.  \\"The Snowman\\" should've tipped me off that this book would end similarly.  Only in this case, it doesn't mean you dislike the rest of the tale.  It's just ... odd.<br /><br />I doubt you've really seen a picture book like this before.  It's incredibly wordy and more than a twinge depressing.  Yet Ug's a likable enough fellow and spending a whole book with him is a pleasure.  I wouldn't go handing this tale to anyone who you fear is stodgy or uptight.  And kids will certainly dig the format, even if they don't understand all the words and references.  Possibly the most amusing caveman picture book available to consumers in this day and age..  It's certainly a book for older children, though.

Without question, the most beautiful picture book of 2004.  No other contenders come half so close.  Author/illustrator Jeannie Baker has somehow managed to create a deeply moral book without placing even a sentence of dialogue or text into her tale.  \\"Home\\" is a simple story that follows the circular nature of life and regeneration by paralleling the growth of a single young girl with the restoration of an urban neighborhood.  What follows is a gorgeous story about what we owe the places where we live, and how best to interact with our environments.  All that and it's still a fun book for Kindergartners to flip through repeatedly.<br /><br />Almost every page of this book is the exact same shot again and again and again.  We are initially looking out of a house's window onto a grimy city street.  In the first picture, a mother and a father cuddle their new baby daughter within their enclosed yard.  The scene is gritty but, because of the couple and their daughter, touching as well.  The next two page spread takes place two years later.  It's clear that the couple have recently put down new sod, though the neighborhood still hasn't changed much around them.  Next door, an old man works on his garden.  With every turn of the page, another 2 years passes.  Right before our eyes we watch the girl, whether she's in the yard working on her bike or in the house waving to some approaching friends.  She's getting older and more mature.  Soon it becomes clear that there's a concentrated \\"Reclaim your street\\" effort on the part of the other people in the neighborhood.  A dingy old lot across the way starts getting painted and given new green trees.  The street itself looks nicer and before you know it a megamall has been torn down, giving the house a beautiful view of a nearby lake.  The girl, Tracy, gets older and eventually marries in a ceremony in the street.  And before you know it, she has a new baby of her own, and a job as a local native plant specialist where once a used car lot used to be.<br /><br />The story in this book is told entirely through complex collaged images.  I referred to Jeannie Baker at the beginning of this review as an \\"illustrator\\" but I think that term does her an injustice.  She would more rightly be called an artist of the finest pedigree.  I do not know how you go about creating full images like this from just snips and spots of paper and cloth.  Yet every single picture in this book is filled with hundreds of delicate details.  Baker gives these scenes a great deal of depth, both literally and figuratively.  If you've ever seen a book by Anno or spent some delightful hours with a kid while they attempted to locate a tiny detail on an enormous image, this book will not fail to impress.<br /><br />I loved the lesson of this story as well.  As Baker herself explains in an afterword to the text, \\"In some cities...communities are finding ways their streets can once again become part of people's sense of home and play a part in their sense of belonging\\".  In these situations, people will act similarly to the characters in this book.  They'll reintroduce native plants and animals.  They'll spend a lot of time revitalizing run down areas.  They'll create safe spaces for kids to play and for old folks to sit and relax in the afternoons.  \\"Home\\" is the ultimate fantasy.  One in which a dirty city area becomes tamed by the efforts of the people who know how to love it.<br /><br />Which leads to the inevitable will-kids-enjoy-this-book question.  The answer is a resounding yes.  They'll love it.  They'll try to find the old lady in the purple dress on every page, or try to figure out exactly when that tree was planted and that highway was rerouted.  Best of all, they'll look at the cover of this book and realize that it is actually the moral of the story.  High above, you can see the neighborhood as the book leaves it at the end.  There are green things growing, childress playing in the streets, and a young woman relaxing in a hammock.  And not that far away, where the used car lot used to stand, is a building entitled, \\"Tracy's Forest\\".  You can't read this book and not be impressed by it.  I couldn't read this book and not love it immediately.  The most impressive book created in years and years.a young woman relaxing in a hammock.

I think we're all familiar with stories in which fathers continually plead with their sons to get involved with baseball.  These kinds of tales abound, usually ending with the father accepting that just because a boy doesn't like baseball, that doesn't mean he's less of a human being.  But how common is it to stumble across stories in which a father disapproves of his son actually liking baseball?  Such is the case with Johanna Hurwitz's male bonding tale, \\"Baseball Fever\\".  When a snobby German intellectual and his all-American, baseball-lovin', pumpkin pie eatin' son try to find a common ground for their interests, it takes a great deal of energy on both their parts to find anything that interests them both.<br /><br />Ezra Feldman's got a problem.  No, not his name.  He has a father that is aiming to win the Least-Cool-Dad Award of the year.  Now his dad's a genius, don't get him wrong.  Smart as a whip and a sociological scholar to boot.  But while Mr. Feldman may appreciate (what he considers) the finer things in life, he just cannot understand baseball.  And Ezra most certainly can.  Ezra has been a baseball fanatic ever since he could understand the game.  So while dear old dad sighs over the rotting of his second child's brain with sports, Ezra is totally enmeshed in the highs and lows of his favorite team, the Mets.  The two have their blow-ups over this seemingly innocuous problem and perhaps they would have counted on ever enjoying one another's company impossible had a fellow scholar of Mr. Feldman's not explained that Ezra's national pastime was actually a good thing.  And then there's the fact that Ezra's been learning a little more chess in his spare time, just so he can play his dad and beat him.  Slowly, through careful steps on both their parts, the two begin to find that they have more in common than they may have thought after all.<br /><br />The book is a good early chapter book for those sports obsessed children who are just beginning to understand the beauty of reading.  Originally written in 1981, the book has aged in odd ways.  There's the fact that Ezra keeps lamenting that the Mets are either in last place or second-to-last place.  There's the fact that Ronald Reagan is the last president mentioned.  But otherwise there are timeless elements to this tale.  I was a little amazed that a book of this reading level was tossing about words like \\"nepotism\\" and \\"capricious\\" hither and yon, but maybe kids will be inspired to look them up.  Stranger things have happened.  The pictures in the book are a bit of a throwback as well.  They're old, no question.  For example, after Mr. Feldman remarks on the diversity of the baseball-attending populace, we are privy to a picture of an almost entirely white crowd of baseball fans (with the exception of one very nervous black person near the front of the shot).<br /><br />If you've a baseball fan of your own who hasn't quite fallen for the whole reading-is-good-for-you line of reasoning, you may wish to craftily loft, \\"Baseball Fever\\" into their rooms.

If you've a baseball fan of your own who hasn't quite fallen for the whole reading-is-good-for-you line of reasoning, you may wish to craftily loft, \\"Baseball Fever\\" into their rooms.  It delivers an interesting premise with some on-the-level writing and believable characterizations.  All in all, a fine young reader work.	2004-11-22

Now, as you may or may not know, author Mo Willems based the name Knuffle Bunny after a Dutch term for something cute and cuddly.  Therefore, the pronounciation of the title, according to him, should not be \\"nuffle\\" bunny but instead \\"k-nuffle\\" bunny.  So let's all say it together, shall we?  K-nuffle Bunny.  K-nuffle Bunny.  K-nuffle Bunny.  Got it?  Good.  Because this book is so well written and so much fun that it deserves to be pronounced correctly when being read to screaming hoardes of children.  Not since Willems' grandiose, \\"Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus\\" (still my favorite read-aloud book of the century) has an author so perfectly attuned himself to the hopes, dreams, and fears of the toddlers and early readers of the world.  This book is a fun fabulous romp.<br /><br />Trixie and her pop are off to the local neighborhood Laundromat one bright and sunny day.  They get there, load the clothes, and take off for home when little Trixie comes to an awful realization.  Knuffle Bunny, her beloved favorite toy, is missing.  Unfortunately for her, she has not yet learned to talk. After some valiant tries (my favorite being the single tearful \\"snurp\\") she feels she has no alternative but to burst into a full-blown tantrum.  This doesn't make her father any happier and since he hasn't realized what the problem is, he takes her home as she kicks and screams.  Once home, however, her mother quickly asks, \\"Where's Knuffle Bunny\\"?  Back runs the whole family to the Laundromat where, at long last, the beloved bunny is recovered and Trixie says her first real words.<br /><br />I haven't read any of the other reviews of this book yet, but I can already predict a potential objection to this tale. Some parents, and similarly ridiculous adults, feel that unless a temper tantrum is disciplined immediately within a book then it is sending a negative message to children everywhere.  They feel that such books encourage children to engage in naughty behavior to get their way.  This idea is, of course, hogwash.  At least it is in this particular case.  Trixie does engage in less than socially acceptable fits, but that's only because she lacks any other means of communication.  Honestly, if she was endowed with a perfect 6500 word vocabulary she would not have a fit.  It is obviously a last resort on her part. So to all of you who would object to such a book merely because a child in it acts like something less than an angel I say \\"pfui\\".<br /><br />The construction of this book is very interesting.  Mo Willems (according to secondhand sources) once said that he initially gave the pictures photographed backgrounds so as to make it easier on himself.  However, he had a great deal of trouble lining up with drawn figures with the photographs so that they'd seem to be the same size.  It's worth it though.  This book is a kind of love story to Willems' own native Brooklyn and he's peppered the images in it with familiar landmarks here and there.  If you live in the area then you won't be surprised to suddenly realize that \\"That's my Laundromat!\\".  So that's nice.  The human characters are as simplistic as the pigeon was in \\"Don't Let the Pigeon Ride the Bus\\".  Just big ole eyes and geometric forms.  Still, there's something perfectly entrancing about the hairless Trixie.  And I for one was very attached to the early picture of mom and dad standing before their home as infant Trixie hangs with arms and legs akimbo from the dad's carrying pack.<br /><br />Kids love this book too.  There are some wonderful ways to read it to them.  For example, when Trixie, \\"went boneless\\" (and what parents amongst us haven't dealt with THAT once in a while?) have the kids in the audience do it too.  They really get into the search and rescue aspects of the tale.  And then of course there are the pictures.  The lovely lovely pictures.<br /><br />\\"Knuffle Bunny\\" has it all.  A weird title to pronounce.  A likable (in spite of her tantrum) main character.  And a completely realistic situation placed against a true-to-life background.  It's a story that will be beloved for years to come.  A big round of applause for Mo Willems, ladies and gentlemen!  He's written a great picture book that everyone can love.ounce.

I rode it all around my block and up and down my street.  I rode it with my dad and brother to the local high school where we'd play a makeshift game of bike tag.  This was all in the 1980s and I have delightful memories of the time.  Sure, there was the occasional scare.  Once I rode into a street without looking and a car had to stop quite short to avoid hitting me.  My dad wasn't too thrilled about that, but nothing bad happened and it wasn't as if I was punished.  And not once, NOT ONCE, did I ever wear a bike helmet.  At the time, I probably had some vague sense that I was invincible.  Today, I look at that near miss with the car and silently shudder.  Today kids know about bike helmets and most of them wear them.  But there's nothing like a book like, \\"Mick Harte Was Here\\" to kinda drill the point home.  I'm not saying that this book is just a good public safety message.  I'm saying it tells a compelling story that will probably encourage your kids to take a little more care of their lives than if they hadn't read it in the first place.<br /><br />\\"So this isn't the kind of book where you meet the main character and you get to like him real well and then he dies at the end\\", says narrator Phoebe Harte.  Mick Harte is dead, to begin with.  In a straightforward voice, thirteen-year-old Pheobe tells of how her brother's death was an accident in the purest sense of the word.  He was on his bike, he hit a rock, and he smashed into a passing truck.  Instantaneous head wound.  Instantaneous death.  But before you get to that you get to see a little of Mick on that last day.  You see how he messed around with his sister and how they had a mild fight that morning. You get a sense of his sense of humor and wacky style.  Without really meaning to, you discover that you really like Mick.  And now he's dead.  With the barest minimum of text, author Barbara Park shows exactly how one family chooses to deal with Mick's death.  Pheobe adjusts better than her parents, but she still has a great deal of difficulty figuring out exactly where Mick is.  Fortunately, by the end of the book she's reached a kind of peace.  A slow understanding that sometimes this is the way things are.  And as a reader, you feel good about that.  Sad, but good.<br /><br />Barbara Park's real strength here is the age group she's written this tale for.  This is a kind of young reader chapter book, just perfect for fourth and fifth graders.  Park's Phoebe has a definite dark sense of humor.  For example, after she remarks that the only upside to someone's death is that you have no appetite she points out that she lost some weight just in time for the funeral.  Says Phoebe in a bleak comedic voice, \\"Nature's real thoughtful that way\\".  \\"Mick Harte Was Here\\", is ultimately hopeful, though.  For people who have always associated Miss Park with her pre-eminently popular \\"Junie B. Jones\\" series, they may find themselves a little shocked to realize that Park can be a deeply profound author when she chooses.  Death isn't glossed over here.  There's a satisfying moment where Phoebe takes on a teacher who keeps talking about the girl's \\"loss\\" and how she's \\"lost\\" a sibling.  As Phoebe is quick to point out, no one here is lost.  Mick's dead.  But by the end of the book, she's come to accept that.  And to find a good way to grieve.<br /><br />It's difficult locating well-written books on death for kids in this reading age group.  Most of the stuff you're going to find is going to concentrate on dead pets or dying horses and the like.  Few writers have the authorial guts to take on the death of a child.  Louisa May Alcott did, but she's one of the few.  Now Barbara Park has come to join her.  This is no \\"Little Women\\", but it's a good read and a true account of how a family must stay together in the time of a crisis.  It's not going to answer any questions for kids about death.  It'll just tell them how some people deal with it.And that's enough.with it.  And that's enough.	2004-11-22
448386:US	49148452	RLG808J52ADYR	156389016X	479375672	The Sandman Library, Volume 3: Dream Country	Books	4	2	2	N	N	dREM Country	It must have occurred to Neil Gaiman that a character like The Sandman presented an infinitely difficult challenge. I mean, here's a character that is all powerful... all the time.  Oh sure, the first Sandman collection (Preludes and Nocturnes) gave us some brief moments of un-Sandmanlike frailty.  There was a distinct possibility at the beginning that dear old Morpheus might come to some serious harm.  With \\"Dream Country\\", however, it's perfectly clear that our hero is impossible to defeat.  This places his author in an interesting position.  Instead of your usual good-guy-fights-bad-guy-and-almost-loses-then-at-last-wins, the story has become more focused on far more infinite matters.  Suddenly we're reading stories in which muses are the prisoners of writers, where cats used to be gods, and the origins of \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\" are explained.  When your hero has supreme powers, things can get a lot more interesting.<br /><br />This particular collection contains four stories, all varying in type and quality.  The first is the most disturbing, and probably also the best.  In it, the muse Calliope has been captured and imprisoned by a writer for sixty years.  Now he's just traded her to an upcoming new author and her torment begins anew.  Fortunately her one-time lover, Morpheus, has recently been freed from his own prison.  And he doesn't look kindly on jailors.  The second story, \\"A Dream of a Thousand Cats\\" opines the theory that once cats were the rulers of the world until humans dreamed themselves into control.  \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\" shows the true source of Shakespeare's brilliant creation and promises future and highly amusing sequels.  Finally, \\"Façade\\" (the weakest of the bunch) shows Element Girl seeking Death's help.<br /><br />Stronger than the previous collection \\"The Doll's House\\", this book is an interesting series of conjectures.  Though the first story hurt to read, it was well thought through.  Gaiman has even added, at the end of this book, the original script as he wrote it for that story.  Unfortunately, artists Kelley Jones and Malcom Jones III decided that in spite of Gaiman's requests that his tortured Calliope be more like a Holocaust victim than a supermodel, this is the comic book world and the supermodel idea won out in the end.  Which sucks and almost ruins the story (once you know Gaiman's original intent).  So naughty naughty to the Joneses.  Other tales fare better.  The one involving cats, in some ways, shows why \\"The Sandman\\" has always been the one graphic novel read by as many women as men.  And no one can deny the enticing \\"Midsummer\\".  I haven't read any Sandman comics past this book, but I am truly hoping for a \\"Tempest\\" based story to come up at some point as well.  As for \\"Façade\\", it's weak.  One of those in-jokes for people who enjoy old comic book superheroes.  If you're not familiar with Element Girl then the story doesn't make a heckuva lotta sense.  Why include it?  Because, I suspect, someone was clamoring for that hottie Death to make another appearance.  But it's just a mildly depressing story that ends oddly.  I didn't know what to make of it.  I just knew it was poorly thought out.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the tales in this book still hold together well in the end.  I wouldn't hand this book to someone trying to decide whether or not to even read \\"The Sandman\\", of course.  This is not a good Sandman starter novel.  But for those already hooked fans, it has its charms.  A fun dwelling on the nature of our own R.E.M. cycles.of this book, the original script as he wrote it for that story.

I'm a pretty easy person to influence.  If I read a glowing review of a picture book, I'm far more likely to love it instantaneously upon reading it than, say, view it with a suspicious eye.  And the advance word on \\"Sidewalk Circus\\" could only be described in one way: glowing.  Every reputable children's publication, from Horn Book and Publisher's Weekly to School Library Journal and Bulletin For the Center of Children's Books could only gush and clamor over the beauty that was \\"Sidewalk Circus\\".  With such remarkably good things said about it, I looked forward to viewing my own copy with quite a bit of anticipation.  Maybe I was just setting myself up for disappointment.  But when I finally read through this reportedly glorious book I found that it was not the genius work of picture book art I'd come to expect.  It's an interesting concept and perhaps a plummy idea.  But it's not particularly winning.  After I read it I could really only think one thing:  Huh.  That's weird.<br /><br />This book is all but wordless, making the action take place entirely in the deft acrylics of illustrator Kevin Hawkes.  If you've ever seen Hawkes' fabulous, \\"Weslandia\\" then you're familiar with his talents.  In the beginning a marquee promotes the following:  \\"COMING SOON...WORLD-RENOWNED...GARIBALDI CIRCUS!!!!....\\".  Across the street from the marquee sits a girl, waiting for the bus.  Beneath her eyes, even the most ordinary human being are transformed into circus-related creatures.  That construction worker balancing two heavy buckets high above the ground?  A tightrope walker, of course.  The cook tossing early morning pancakes on a grill?  A juggler of highest renown.  And what about those window washers that accidentally swing high off the ground?  Trapeze artists.  In the end the girl gets on her bus, still entranced by her thoughts and a boy takes her place on the bench, creating whole new imaginings of his own.<br /><br />The idea is very good.  And since author Paul Fleischman didn't actually write many words for this tale, he must have closely collaborated with Mr. Hawkes.  The ways in which the girl sees everyday people as circus performers is through their shadows.  The shadow of an old man posting flyers turns into a magnificent image of a circus ringleader announcing the next act.  The problem is, the book's a little messy.  The shadow idea appears here and there, then drops off without explanation.  It's a little difficult to make out some of the images as well.  For example, unless you look very closely, you may not notice the shadow of a big top splayed against a building across from the fascinated girl.  There's also an odd sequence involving two clumsy skateboarding youths, a painter, and some window washers that doesn't flow together particularly well.  I kept feeling like I was missing something.  Sometimes the shadows work splendidly (like the one on the cover) but other times they're actually a little hard to separate from the real life action.  Only a kid with a deep-seated conviction that he or she was going to figure out every shot in this book would take much pleasure in the story.<br /><br />I feel terrible saying this.  I mean, everyone and their mother seems to like it.  I've heard it bandied about for certain awards and many many people think it's worthwhile reading.  And I did attempt to like it.  I did.  I tried everything in my power to do so.  But why on earth are the shadows of the pigeons shaped like toucans?  Why do the window washers have difficulties with their rig anyway?  Why did the youths' skateboards disappear in one two page spread then reappear all over again on the next?  Maybe kids won't notice these inconsistencies but they're bound to be a little puzzled by the story's haphazard action.  Take it from me... I wanted to like this book and it certainly had a lot going for it.  It just didn't live up to its potential.  As picture books go, it's so-so.  Not very good.  Not very bad.  Not very anything.  Read it if you like, but consider giving it a glance before making any purchases.d.  Not very bad.  Not very anything.

I expected kids to request books about dinosaurs, and unicorns, and magic.  What I didn't expect was the overwhelming amount of books requested regarding trains.  I thought the love of trains was long past and that kids would have forgotten their shiny chugging ways.  But with the popularity of things like \\"The Polar Express\\" and \\"Harry Potter\\", trains are getting rediscovered all the time.  That means any book, picture or otherwise, that capitalizes on this is going to be a hit.  There is an abudance of poorly written train fare out there.  Then you stumble across something like Margaret Wise Brown's, \\"Two Little Trains\\" which was recently reillustrated by the talented Leo and Diane Dillon.  It's not only well-written but remarkably beautiful.  Any and every young train enthusiast should pluck it up forthwith.<br /><br />Unlike many picture books, the story told by this one begins on the cover.  As we look at this book we see a beautiful sleek silver train resting in a station.  Beside it, alongside the track, sit two packed bags and a wrapped present of a toy train.  By the time you read the title page the present has been opened (presumably by small hands) and the little train sits silently on the floor awaiting play.  Then the words begin.  \\"Two little trains went down the track/ Two little trains went West\\".  On the left hand page sits the grand old silvery sleek train, gearing up to leave the station.  On the right hand page you can just barely make out the little toy train as it sits beneath a kitchen chair, readying itself for its journey as well.  As the big adult train travels through the countryside, the little toy train does the same, only on a much smaller scale.  So when the big train goes through a mountainous tunnel, the little one passes under a propped up book that's entitled \\"Hills\\".  When the big one goes over a river, the little one rides over the edge of a full bath.  Rain on the big train?  A bathroom shower on the little one.  It continues in this fashion until at last the two trains reach their destinations when, \\"They had come to the edge of the West\\".<br /><br />Widely regarded children's author Margaret Wise Brown originally wrote this story in 1949, possibly with a completely different vision of how it would play out.  After all, the text never says that one train is real and that the other a toy.  Instead it says that one train was a \\"streamlined train\\" and that the other was, \\"a little old train\\".  So presumably (and I haven't seen the original so I can't really attest to this) this was supposed to be a story about the old and the new trains of the world.  Instead, illustrators Leo and Diane Dillon have given the book an entirely new life.  The original words by Brown are just as catchy and interesting as they ever were.  Incredibly enough, they have not aged.  But the pictures are what really give you pause.<br /><br />Everything in this book is given a kind of rounded sheen in this story.  Each surface is deep and clearly delineated.  Some of the simplest objects you might find in a home are present here.  The Dillons have placed this book in a time that could be anything from 1949 to 2005.  Certainly the toys in the child's house are a little old-fashioned, but they're also timeless.  There's a bouncy ball, a teddy bear, and a rubber duck.  The toy train itself is made of colorful blocks of wood, not something plastic or breakable.  The streamlined train appears to be placed in a contemporary world (it's super-sleek) but again there aren't any landmarks that make this clear.  Just the usual bridges, cities, and countrysides.  I liked the Dillons' choice to never show the child that is playing with the little train.  Instead, we occasionally see a rubber ducky noting the toy's progress as it navigates difficult slopes and wet spots.  At the end of the story, the little train rests beside a child's bed, thekid in it asleep and turned away from us.  We don't even know if it's a boy or a girl, and that's a wonderful thing.<br /><br />Usually I think that reillustrating old classic picture books is a dangerous occupation.  Would you countenance someone drawing new illustrations for \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" or \\"Millions of Cats\\"?  Of course you wouldn't.  But in cases where the original book is forgotten (possibly rightly) I've no qualms about the process in the least.  The Dillons have done a remarkable job here, one that I've no doubt will remain a favorite in children's homes for years and years to come.  If you want a picture book for your kids that is catchy and bouncy, accompanied by illustrations that never grow old AND that your child will probably adore reading again and again... give \\"Two Little Trains\\" a try.

You have your fantastical elements on the one hand and your down-to-earth heartfelt story on the other.  Your fantasy must be rooted in basic human problems that we all deal with (or at least can sympathize towards).  In \\"Falcon's Egg\\" the fantastical elements are firmly in place.  Magic heated eggs?  Check.  Mythological creature from another time and place?  Check.  The basic human groundings are there too.  Impossible matriarch figure?  Check.  Kid who doesn't have any friends in school?  Check.  So you'd think that the simple addition of one element to another would yield the ideal story.  It doesn't quite work that way.  Sure, \\"Falcon's Egg\\" is a fine telling of a magical tale.  It's all well and good for what it is.  But there's something lacking in this tale.  Though a nicely written book with plummy plotting and choice characters, it is merely good.  It is not exemplary.<br /><br />Falcon's life is not ideal.  Living with her immature and irresponsible mother and taking care of her baby brother almost on her own, she has to navigate daily through an existence of the usual kid woes.  Falcon's parents divorced years ago and since then she's not seen much of her father.  She has a fairly strong base of family friends, of course.  There's Ardene, an adult who lives upstairs and is always happy to have Falcon over for tea.  And there's Aunt Emily who has lived for an incredibly long time but is still close to her eleven-year-old great-niece.  But when Falcon finds hot red egg nestled in the long grasses of Central Park, she knows she's on to something big.  Soon the egg becomes a large part of Falcon's life.  She tells her friends about it and soon everyone watches entranced as the scarlet sphere reveals a small equally scarlet dragon.  Falcon grows deeply attached to her little ward, but a time soon comes when she must accept that Egg (as she has christened the beast) must live its own life someday.<br /><br />I was initially a little shocked at the incompetence of Falcon's mother at the start.  A flighty children's book illustrator, she rivals only Saffy's mum in, \\"Saffy's Angel\\" for most-negligent-but-idly-interested-mother-in-a-work-of-fiction award.  Missy (as Falcon calls her) is prone to completely ignoring her children when she gets paid work, constantly giving them money to purchase take-out food and letting them wander hither and thither through dark dangerous New York.  Falcon, fortunately, is a capable human being but prone to utter self-hatred when she forgets to watch her little brother for even a second.  Missy feels no such guilt.  She's a kind of adolescent herself who takes a lot more interest in playing dress up with her children than asking Falcon how she feels or how her day went at school.  There's not much of a resolution to this storyline by the end of the book either.  This struck me as honest, but odd.<br /><br />As for the character of Falcon herself, she's fine.  A loner who isn't particularly good at making friends with people her own age, Falcon (understandably) creates an unhealthy bond with her little Egg. It's only when the dragon makes it perfectly clear that it is not a pet or a dear companion that Falcon is able to let go of her discovery.  Falcon is most sympathetic when she's dealing with her simpering mother.  She's less likable when she starts making unreasonable dragon-related demands. But this is a believable reaction on her own part.  And through it all you feel sorry for her.  You feel sorry for the choices she's had to make.  And you fell kind of bad that not much has been resolved by the end of the book.  I would have thought author Luli Gray would have given us some kind of awakening or understanding at the story's close.  No such understanding is forthcoming.<br /><br />Just the same, for any kid who has ever dreamed of someday finding something extraordinary in an ordinary place, this book's perfect.  In plot it bears some passing resemblance to the now remarkably popular, \\"Eragon\\" by Christopher Paolini, but is meant for a younger reading group.  For pure wish-fulfillment, \\"Falcon's Egg\\" delivers.  It's not the most satisfying fantasy out there for kids, but it's definitely interesting enough and well-written enough to garner a fair amount of attention.

I think it all comes down to what you really want out of your Caldecott Medal winning picture books.  If you want smart, tightly written, even (dare I say?) amusing stories then you'd probably migrate towards \\"My Friend Rabbit\\" or even \\"Mei Li\\".  If, on the other hand, you're looking for a book that is basically a novelization of those treacly \\"Precious Moments\\" figurines, \\"Prayer For a Child\\" is for you.  Let me say right here and now that I have absolutely no problem with a well-written Christian children's picture book.  But to my mind, even the most hastily slapped together \\"Veggie Tales\\" novelization has more intrinsic value than this 1942 award winner.  And I think we can safely ascribe the blame to one person and one person alone.  Illustrator Elizabeth Orton Jones.<br /><br />In this story, we read a poem intended for every red-blooded Christian American child.  The prayer asks for blessings upon their toys, their bed, and their friends.  It gives honor to the child's father and mother and is pretty much your standard bedtime fare.  So that's fine.  Then we get into the pictures.  The book itself was written in 1942, a time when children's books were sometimes downright gritty.  \\"Prayer For a Child\\" is not gritty.  \\"Prayer For a Child\\" is downright cutesy-pie.  Our heroine is an adorable little blonde child dressed in footie pajamas (complete with a flap in the back).  She has adorable little white friends and lives in an adorable little room with adorable little angel dolls.  That's pretty much all you can say about her.  Illustrator Jones didn't pepper this book with much in the way of surprises.  She did, to her credit, include a section about blessing children everywhere in which the accompanying illustration shows adorable children from around the globe.  But the pictures themselves are poorly done.  The shot of the girl as she attempts to lie on her bed is downright bizarre in terms of perspective.  Half her body lies happily on the bed while her lower half seems to be standing upright, mid-step.  Yet the bed fills the entire frame.  This is just one of a myriad of problems in this story.<br /><br />If you want a good Christian bed-time book to lull your child to sleep with, pick one of the one's currently on the market today.  Christain lit. has probably produced thousands of books that make for worthier reading than the sugar-coated \\"Prayer For a Child\\".  It does not look good, it does not read particularly well.  I do not recommend it.  Not a jot.er half seems to be standing upright, mid-step.  Yet the bed fills the entire frame.

458674:US	49148452	R1GEGLXPKH7VE6	0930289595	670576164	The Sandman Library, Volume 2: The Doll's House	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Dream me a dream	I belong to that great unwashed mass of people who have not yet read every Sandman comic collection in existence.  I came to the series only recently, and as such I decided to systematically work my way through each chapter in the Sandman Chronicles.  Thus far, I have finished two (count `em) two collections of the series.  The first was the well-known and regarded \\"Preludes and Nocturnes\\".  The second is the less regarded, \\"Doll's House\\".  Before I picked up this collection I was informed by my husband that with this collection he no longer felt the necessity to read any more Sandman comics.  Something in this book turned him off the series for good.  Bearing that in mind I went into \\"The Doll's House\\" with some trepidation.  It is a difficult book at times, and probably has a small flaw here and there.  Nonetheless, I found it just as enticing and well-written (better illustrated even) than its predecessor.  \\"The Doll's House\\" does not, contrary to the opinion of some, disappoint.<br /><br />The last chapter in \\"Preludes and Nocturnes\\" is included at the beginning of this book, allowing people who skipped the first to still understand the second.  And if THAT wasn't enough then Neil Gaiman himself has included a helpful introduction that sums up everything that has come before.  The first official story of this collection is a little bleaker.  An elder African man tells a story to a younger of the only woman the Sandman ever loved and the consequences that arose from that loving.  It is a good way to telling the reader right off the bat that our hero is not, at times, much in the way of a good guy.  In fact, he can be downright evil and petty.  Other stories are less disturbing (in that particular way).  We meet Rose and view her adventures as she attempts to locate a long lost little brother.  We find that the Sandman, while he was imprisoned for so many years, has lost four of his major arcana dreams and he must personally track them down.  As he does so, his destiny and the destiny of Rose herself become intertwined.<br /><br />Gaiman does a couple things with this book that I highly approved of.  For one thing, he finally makes a direct reference to the great \\"Little Nemo\\" comics of Winsor McCay.  You would think the greatest dreaming comic strip (until \\"The Sandman\\", of course) would have earned itself a mention before now.  As it is, Gaiman does a spot-on imitation of McCay's style.  Other elements in the collection are especially good.  There is a storyline about a man who wishes to never die, and who meets with Morpheus in a pub every one hundred years throughout the centuries.  There's a rather amusing convention of serial killers who tell the hotel hosting them that they are a cereal convention.  And then there's the fact that Gaiman is constantly bringing elements from previous plots into current ones.  The dreams in this book are remarkably similar to those you've had in your sleep.  His nightmares, however, are worse.  Much worse than anything you might conjure up from your own unconscious.<br /><br />I don't think this collection is quite as strong as its predecessor, but it doesn't have to be.  It's just a well-written exciting fantasy about a nicely mysterious protagonist.  It's amazing how Gaiman can take a hero who basically has all the powers of the world at his command and still keep the plotline interesting.  It's also not every graphic novel that ends with you mentally pleading for the hero NOT to kill someone.  A nice touch.  Overall, a strong companion to previous Sandman efforts.destiny and the destiny of Rose herself become intertwined. <br />  <br />Gaiman does a couple things with this book that I highly approved of.

When I was a kid though, Judy Blume meant only one thing.  \\"Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing\\".  One of my favorite books, written incredibly well, it captured perfectly what it means to be a kid with a little sibling.  This book was a revelation.  Nowhere else had I encountered an early reader story that wasn't afraid to say that little sibs can be annoying brats.  There are roughly five bazillion books out there written specifically to coax older children into befriending their younger siblings.  Far fewer are the books that recognize the difficulties these elder kids have to deal with when they're forced to abandon their personal privacy and sanity for the sake of a little brother or sister.  The one book that really spoke to me about this (and was really funny as well) was Judy Blume's 1972 creation.  And it reads as perfectly today as it did some thirty odd years ago.<br /><br />There was Peter.  And then there was Fudge.  Peter Hatcher is nine years old and has the awful job of dealing with almost-three-year-old Fudgie at all times.  Fudge is what a polite person might call a lively child.  To Peter, however, Fudge is a holy terror.  If he's not sticking green food stamps to full suitcases or refusing to eat until Peter stands on his head, he's leaping from large rocks (to fly) and throwing tantrums in shoe stores.  Peter is understandably jealous of the amount of attention Fudge attracts but at least he has his pet turtle Dribble to comfort him.  Each chapter in this book is a small story about the daily interactions and adventures of the Hatcher boys.  The final tale (the most important day of Peter's life, according to him) is probably one of the most memorable episodes in children's literature to date.<br /><br />What Blume does right with this book is put everything entirely within the first person perspective of Peter himself.  His tone of voice is pitch perfect.  You empathize with him completely.  When Fudge goes into his older brother's room and destroys his poster for school, you're just as inclined to see him punished as Peter is.  And when Peter must deal with an awful loss at the book's end, you know just how he feels.  Somehow, Blume has taken that prickly mind of the fourth grade boy, and made it completely understandable to the rest of the world.  This is no small feat.<br /><br />There are some small dated elements to the book.  Mrs. Hatcher is, suffice to say, your stereotypical frantic mama.  You begin to wish that she would grow a backbone once in a while instead of sobbing \\"my baby\\" whenever Fudge misbehaves in a dangerous way.  As for Fudge, he's great in that he's awful.  The worst possible three-year-old to be trapped in a family with.  If there's a way to screw something up, he'll manage it.  The age difference between a nine-year-old and a three-year-old is immense.  Blume bridges that gap adeptly.<br /><br />I state here and now, as loudly as my little lungs can carry sound (or my little fingers can type a review) that this is one of the best children's books in American literature.  It has everything you could possibly want.  Humor, adventure, a hero with many troubles, and a happy ending.  For kids that have a Fudge of their own, Peter's problems will speak to them instantly.  For kids that ARE Fudge, the book will strike them as an amusing romp through a world that is both familiar and unfamiliar.

Once I was perusing a children's literature listserv when someone proposed the following question:  Are there any good children's books about Jewish children that don't focus solely on the Holocaust?  Locating such tales is not easiest task in the world.  In fact, finding modern books about contemporary Jewish children is well nigh impossible sometimes.  You're better off if you look for books containing recent Jewish immigrants, if anything.  The best books of this kind is definitely the \\"All-of-a-Kind Family\\" series by Sydney Taylor.  Less well-known but still worthy reading is Joan W. Blos's, \\"Brooklyn Doesn't Rhyme\\".  A familiar story of a girl living in early 20th century New York, the tale focuses on the lives of Jewish arrivals in America and the world in which they lived.<br /><br />Rosey has a pretty darn good life.  Her father has a steady job, she lives in a nice house in Brooklyn, and her family loves one another.  But when asked in school to write her family's story in a composition, Rosey finds herself stymied.  According to her, nothing interesting has ever happened in her family.  Sure, there was that time when Rosey bought a bag of chocolate babies for her new baby sister and then ate every last one.  Or when she tried to help out her depressed serving girl by taking her to the doctor.  There was the story of how her brother made friends with a boy in her grade, or that grueling move the family made from their flat to their new home.  Eventually, Rosey tells us the stories of her family's life and how well they've survived in Brooklyn itself.  And we find that perhaps she's got a lot to say about her world and people.  Much of it is very interesting indeed.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, this book is closest to \\"All-of-a-Kind Family\\" in a variety of ways.  The setting, the characters, and the time period are very similar.  Most surprising to me was the fact that both books even went so far as to arrange storylines around those tasty chocolate babies.  There are some distinct differences, of course.  For one thing, \\"Brooklyn Doesn't Rhyme\\" places itself firmly within its time period in each and every chapter.  Sometimes it teaches the reader about suffrage or the rights of women to unionize.  Other times it adds little period details while furthering the plot.  Kids who read this book will learn about hauling ice to the ice box or the early years of the Ford motor plant.  Oddly enough, this book isn't very Jewish.  Where \\"All-of-a-Kind Family\\" made certain to mention specific holidays, foods, and religious customs, \\"Brooklyn Doesn't Rhyme\\" just mentions that characters were forced to flee from different countries because of their religion.  That's about the extent of their culture.  \\"All-of-a-Kind Family\\" tackled questions of inter-religious marriage and the breaking of faith.  This book is more interested in presenting the time period than it is handling the tough questions.  As a result, it's nice but somewhat bland.<br /><br />I suppose it's not particularly fair to compare this book to Sydney Taylor's classic.  But in some ways, it's impossible not to.  \\"Brooklyn Doesn't Rhyme\\" doesn't fill a void.  It doesn't offer much of anything new to readers.  And while I appreciated its inclusion of suffrage and unionism, these themes appear in stronger and more interesting books.  This story is definitely interesting from time to time, but other books have told this tale better before.

460842:US	49148452	RREX4MFSYISYL	0670133698	404738981	Arrow to the Sun: A Pueblo Indian Tale	Books	3	6	15	N	N	Level 5: Escape the serpents and the room of lightning	I don't think I can judge Gerald McDermott's 1975 Caldecott winning picture book, \\"Arrow to the Sun\\" fairly.  You see, I am a child of the 80s.  I remember the early days of Colico Vision and Atari.  I have very clear images in my head of some of the first arcade games, like Q-Bert, Donkey Kong, and Super Mario Brothers.  Why do I invoke such images when I'm (supposedly)  reviewing \\"Arrow to the Sun\\"?  Because like these games, \\"Arrow to the Sun\\" suffers for its time period.  Author/illustrator Gerald McDermott strived very hard to make this story both deeply original and timeless.  In many ways, he has succeeded.  But if you, like myself, played a single pixilated arcade game in the late 70s or early to mid 80s then you'll take one look at this book and notice its video game aspects.  It's a beautiful story.  It's just tainted in the eyes of the children of the 80s.<br /><br />In this retelling of an ancient legend (or so the bookflap assures me), we learn about a boy unlike any other.  When the Lord of the Sun sent a \\"spark of life\\" to earth, it found a young woman in a pueblo.  The woman then gave birth to a son who found himself desperate to know his father.  The boy leaves home and finally comes to realize from whom he is descended.  To prove himself to the Lord of the Sun he withstands numerous video game-like trials and finally is transformed so that he may bring the Sun's spirit to the world of men.<br /><br />Echoes of this story have been found around the world in everything from the birth of Christianity to ancient Zeus-appears-as-a-shaft-of-light type tales.  This particular rendition of such a story is a little more tasteful in its presentation.  McDermott has always had a keen sense of storytelling.  This is apparent in everything from his fan-freakin'-tastic, \\"Zomo the Trickster Rabbit\\" to the more contemporary \\"Creation\\".  \\"Arrow to the Sun\\" has just the right tone of voice and increasing urgency one needs in a good story.<br /><br />As for the pictures, they look like characters from a Commodore 64 game.  According to all-knowing bookflap, this tale, \\"captures the stylized look of Pueblo Indian art\\".  I'm fairly certain I've seen Pueblo Indian art before.  And I'm almost certain it didn't give me urges to go play Load Runner or Frogger.  While much of the art in this book is very beautiful (the design on our hero's chest is a lovely geometric shape) it suffers from its form.  The colors are beautiful, no question.  The designs on many of the pictures is great.  But the odd blocky pixel-like look is jarring and (to my mind) overly familiar.<br /><br />So unfortunately, McDermott ended up doing something he didn't want to.  His intentions, I'm certain, were to create something timeless.  Instead, he make a picture book that remains firmly stuck in the age of Pac-Man.  If arcade settings and characters don't disturb you, you may be the perfect consumer for this tale.  If, on the other hand, you prefer your picture books to be a little lovelier and a little less circa 1983, you might want to pass this puppy by.  Just a warning to you Gen X parents out there.for the pictures, they look like characters from a Commodore 64 game.

I shied away from stories that told it like it is.  No reality for me, thank you very much.  I saw the books, in which the main characters suffered, as objects that could (when read) make me miserable too.  I wasn't much for identifying, as a kid.  Yet there was one book out there that I not only recognized as chock full o' misery, but grudgingly had to accept as good.  There are millions of kids out there for whom, \\"Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day\\" is a kind of balm.  A book that understands what they have to go through sometimes and how some days you just shouldn't get out of bed (especially if you wake up with gum in your hair).  Judith Viorst's 1972 classic is one of those rare stories that hasn't aged one tiny jot.  The problems faced by Alexander are still faced by children worldwide.  Even in Australia.<br /><br />Alexander has had better day.  The book details every bad, awkward, and annoying thing that happens to him after he wakes up one horrid morning.  You might not think that a litany of negative occurrences would be very interesting to read.  In this book, they're consistently fascinating.  After waking up and proceeding to trip, slip, and slide through his morning, Alexander has to face problems varying from a teacher's disapproval to being told that he's his best friend's third best friend.  His mom forgot to pack his dessert, his trip to the dentist reveals a cavity that needs to be filled, he falls into mud, gets bad shoes, and has to eat lima beans.  All the while Alexander repeats how he'll probably move to Australia.  Finally, when he goes to bed (and this is the kicker) the cat decides to sleep with his brother and not him.  Alexander's mom assures him that everyone has bad days sometimes.  That goes for the land down under too.<br /><br />I loved the consistency of this story.  There isn't that magical moment where Alexander makes a new friend and everything starts looking up.  He isn't taught a preachy lesson about being kind to your siblings and how that kindness will come back to you in the end.  No, this is just the ultimate story about those awful days we all have sometimes.  Each of us has been through them at some point.  They're those days where nothing you can do comes out right (though I suspect the repeated phrase of adults is less, \\"I think I'll move to Australia\\" and more \\"I think I'll move to Canada\\").  So Judith Viorst really hit on something good when she wrote this book.  Illustrator Ray Cruz matches her dead on writing point for point.  His Alexander is grouchy, miserable, but ultimately someone a kid can identify with.  He has older siblings that tease him and parents that sometimes don't understand.  Reading this book as an adult, I noticed for the first time that Alexander's father also seems to be having a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day of his own.  The black and white pen and ink drawings in this story are fabulous as well.  And how did Cruz manage to draw kids that aren't dated?  Their hair and clothing could be from 1972, 82, 92, or even 2002 for that matter.<br /><br />I don't think all kids will like this book, but I do think that all kids will understand it on some level.  It may not be their favorite story, but Alexander is a perfect recipient for all the awful stuff that happens to him.  Reading this book, kids can feel comforted that at least it's Alexander who's dealing with all these problems and not them.  This book is as fresh and fabulous as the day it was thought up.  I don't think any child's education is complete without having skimmed it at least once in their travels.

If you've ever happened to catch one of his covers for the New Yorker then you know what I'm talking about.  Joyce has a style all his own.  His pictures are curvy and lit with subtle variations.  He's so accomplished that when he draws a gigantic character with just a tiny black dot of an eye, that character appears warm and inviting rather than scary and intimidating.  As an artist, he is probably one of the best living today.  As an author, he leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />\\"Santa Calls\\" is Joyce's tribute to a variety of different sources.  Everything from Winsor McCay's \\"Little Nemo\\" to \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" appears within the pages of this book.  The story is set in 1908, wherein we meet our hero Art Atchinson Aimesworth.  Art's your average cowboy hat wearing adventuresome young fella.  He has his best friend Spaulding Littlefeets (Comanche) and his sister Esther and things are going pretty well for the three, until one day they discover a box outside their home.  It's big and red and along the side are the initials S.C.  It doesn't take much deduction to discover that this is the personal property of one Mr. Santa Claus.  The box reveals a summons for the three to come to the North Pole, and go they do.  Once there, Santa refuses to reveal the nature of the visit, mysteriously saying that, \\"Some secrets are better left unsolved\\".  The book then contains a ride in Santa's sleigh, a ghastly kidnapping, and a heroic rescue.  By the end of the book, Santa still hasn't revealed why he invited the three kids to his world, but readers that take the time to read two envelopes at the end of the book will discover what the reason was on their own.<br /><br />Joyce seems to be playing with a multitude of different elements with this story.

467166:US	49148452	R3DRA2LF21YLII	0064405850	665251069	Strawberry Girl 60th Anniversary Edition (Trophy Newbery)	Books	4	144	157	N	N	Berries for Birdie	I hereby nominate Lois Lenski's 1946 Newbery Award winning book, \\"Strawberry Girl\\" for the Most-Misleading-Cover-Art-And-Title Award of the 20th century.  Picking up this story, I was fairly certain that this tale would be a cutesy little number about a girl who picks strawberries for fun.  On the cover, after all, you see a little blond barefooted child clutching a cache of yummy red fruit as she walks along in her sunbonnet.  I was anticipating Strawberry Shortcake.  What I got was \\"Tobacco Road\\" for kids.  An oddly shocking delight.<br /><br />Lenski prefaces this book with an explanation of Florida \\"Crackers\\".  Personally, I've never heard this term used as anything but a base insult.  Lenski, however, seems to think that the phrase is deserving of pride.  Concentrating on the hardworking rural natives of Florida, she gives a little background on the history of these people in an effort to, \\"present vivid, sympathetic pictures of the real life of different Americans, against authentic backgrounds of diverse localities\\".  In this case, Lenski interviewed \\"Crackers\\" on her own time and used their stories (watered down, as was appropriate) to write this book.  The result is a seething concoction of barely contained violence and danger, centered on the lives of two very different Florida Cracker families.<br /><br />The Boyers have just moved into the old Roddenberry house, and they've got big plans.  Originally from Marion County, Carolina, the family attempts to settle into their new life and make friends with their neighbors.  Unfortunately, those neighbors include Sam Slater.  A nasty man with a penchant for drunkenness, Sam's just the kind of guy who doesn't mind causing his fellow man a bit of trouble once in a while.  When the wild hogs and cows of the Slaters start eating the Boyer family's crops, tensions begin to rise between the two households.  The Boyers are good hardworking people with pride and bright ideas.  The Slaters could be categorized as white trash, never lifting a finger to feed their own animals and jealously coveting those nice things their neighbors have.  Our hero of the story, Birdie Boyer, has her own problems dealing with Shoestring Slater, a boy roughly her age who's just as likely to brag or throw a snake on a girl's hat as he is help keep his father's pigs out of trouble or lament his own lack of education.<br /><br />Lenski does an interesting thing with the beginning of this book.  She begins it through the point of view of seven-year-old Essie Slater, leading you to believe that she herself will be the heroine of this tale.  As you slowly come to the realization that her father is not the usual wise/good/loving pop found in most 1945 children's books, the text suddenly switches to the point of view of Birdie Boyer and Essie is never heard from again.  Lenski's characters aren't as cardboard cut-outish as they first appear either.  At the start, the Boyers seem good and the Slaters bad.  Then odd occurrences make you begin to doubt this assumption.  Mr. Boyer, in an attempt to teach Shoestring Slater a lesson, whips the boy harshly in front of his mother and sisters (who, understandably, are frightened and furious by this violence).  Mr. Boyer is also prone to killing his neighbor's pigs if they get in his way, even sometimes cutting off their ears as a sign.  He won't even create a path for Slater's cattle herd to reach the nearest water source, instead fencing up the area and getting mad when it's cut down.  The Slaters also win your affection at odd moments.  Birdie is quick to blame Shoestring for anything he does wrong, but the boy is a good egg in a bad situation.  He has to juggle his family's expectations while figuring out for himself what the right and wrong actions he should take really are.<br /><br />A lot of this book is enjoyable partly because it goes the \\"Little House On the Prairie\\" route and explains the day-to-day goings on of the Boyers' lives in interesting ways.  In what other children's book will you learn exactly how to grind sugar cane and pull it for fun afterwards?  Or the ins and outs of raising strawberries in naturally sandy soil?  What other book explains the intricacies of Florida weather in the spring and summer?  Or tells you how to create roses out of paraffin?  Part of the charm of \\"Strawberry Girl\\" is in describing how the old Florida pioneers did it.  Less impressive are Lenski's pictures.  It was with a heavy heart that I discovered that Lenski considered herself an artist first and a novelist second.  That's too bad because the illustrations in this tale are particularly poor.  I just couldn't like 'em and I suspect they'll easily deter many a prospective boy reader with their girlyness.<br /><br />For a surprisingly dour and sharpely written novel about roughing it, definitely try \\"Strawberry Girl\\".  You might find that the ending suffers from being a little too pat (there's a happy finish there that jars with the realism of the rest of the text) but all in all it's still a very interesting read.  For a good Florida based kid's book, both this and Carl Hiaasen's, \\"Hoot\\" are excellent choices.  A sobering but enjoyable tale.g ways.

Jones has the dubious honor of being my current favorite fantasy writer for children and teens (aside from J.K. Rowling, I suppose).  Her collected stories contain more whimsy and wit in a single paragraph than 98% of the adult books on the market today, let alone those for the kiddies.  \\"Charmed Life\\" is the first in the collected Chrestomanci novel series.  A witty tale of a brother and is magical sister, the book is pure Jones and as fresh as if it was written yesterday.<br /><br />Cat and his sister Gwendolen were the only survivors of the fatal boat crash that drowned both their parents and a host of innocent civilians.  Now on their own, Gwendolen is turning out to be an incredibly competent young witch.  Cat, for his part, isn't magical in the least and is perfectly content to stick by Gwendolen at all times.  When a mysterious relative by the name of Chrestomanci comes to take the two to his home, Gwendolen (spoiled with a nasty sense of entitlement) thinks she's about to be realized as the genius sorceress she truly is.  She's in for a nasty surprise as Chrestomanci and his large extended family treat her as normally as possible.  When Gwendolen's pranks for attention go too far, Cat finds that her schemes might well upset the balance of magic in the world.  Worse, she may not be the beloved sister he really needs.<br /><br />This story has all sorts of tiny magical details and sly spots throughout it.  In many ways it's a book more similar to Harry Potter than most.  Of course, \\"Charmed Life\\" originally was published in 1977 so there's little question of who may have influenced whom.  The characters are, of course, great.  Jones has always excelled at writing truly awful children.  Real remarkably spoiled brats.  Gwendolen is a perfect example of this.  She's stuck-up, cruel, and not a very good sister.  Cat, for his part, is completely passive.  He lets Gwendolen do whatever she wants whenever she wants it, and even goes so far as to miss her when she unexpectedly disappears halfway through the book.  Chrestomanci himself is a huge departure from the stereotypical wise wizard.  He has a very nice wife and two slightly overweight (but likable once you get to know them) children.  He's a spiffy dresser and not particularly old.  I doubt that there are many like him in the fantasy wizard world.<br /><br />If there's a flaw with the book, it's that the reader has a hard time suspending disbelief at times.  Once Cat finds himself in terrible trouble, he refuses to consult with Chrestomanci.  The reasons for this are weak and somewhat confusing.  Also, Chrestomanci himself is also prone to not explaining himself.  He has a particularly weak reason for this as he explains at the end of the novel, making many of the plot points somewhat hard to believe at times.<br /><br />Otherwise, the book's a pip.  If you've already discovered Diana Wynne Jones, this one should certainly not disappoint.  If you've never encountered her before, this is an excellent place to start.  It's witty and well-written and full of particularly enjoyable characters and situations.  There's enough imagination in this puppy to tide you over for quite some time.

I'm far more likely to pick up a book by Chris Van Allsburg or David Weisner than I am a William Steig or even a Jules Feiffer.  Still, there was something about, \\"The Daddy Mountain\\" that called to me.  The first time I saw it it looked...different.  Like it had something to say to me.  So it was with great surprise that I found myself picking it up, flipping through it, reading it intently, and falling head over heels in love with it.  \\"The Daddy Mountain\\" will probably not garner that many awards.  After one hundred years it will probably lay forgotten in ancient dusty attics across America.  But as long as we're in the here and now, I encourage you each and every one to seek out this marvelous picture book and take a gander at it for yourselves.  It's really quite impressive.<br /><br />Our heroine is not very big but her ambitions are huge.  She is, personally, going to scale the Daddy Mountain.  On the first page we have her eyeing the mountain in question.  The Daddy Mountain is greyed out, allowing us to concentrate entirely on the girl and her progress.  As she begins the climb she offers us useful tidbits of information on how one goes about climbing daddy mountains in general.  Everything from \\"Fruit juice gives me energy to climb\\" to \\"Remember, the Daddy Mountain must wear a shirt.  Because if you grab hold of his skin, he'll get mad\\" are offered to the reader.  The climb is treacherous, and there's more than one fall to the bottom.  Fortunately, by the penultimate pull-out page the little girl sits perched on her father's head, high high above the ground.  Gleefully she tries to get her mother's attention as her daddy says reassuringly, \\"No problem.  She's fine\\".  Her mom, needless to say, is less than thrilled.<br /><br />I've heard odd criticisms of this book.  Some people have claimed that the final shot of the mother gasping in what could either be terror or anger (along with the girl's words, \\"I think she's going to faint\\") is promoting bad stereotypes.  Certainly, the mom is clasping her hands over her eyes.  True that.  But to say that this promotes the idea that mothers are weak individuals who can't take it when their daughters do exciting this is a bit naïve.  I prefer to interpret the image as a mother's headache at her daughter's inclination towards foolhardy father-climbing and (more importantly) helpless anger at a pop who encourages it.  Regardless, it's a funny last picture and no more offensive than any other parents-worried-for-the-safety-of-their-children books out there today.<br /><br />And I love the art.  Who knew?  Feiffer may be a little unclear when it comes to individual toes on characters, but the pictures in this book are pitch perfect.  You really sympathize with the heroine as she reaches painfully for the Daddy Mountain's belt.  I loved how the Daddy Mountain himself was greyed out and more a geographical construction than a man (until the last pull-out shot, that is).  Where the girl is drawn with colored markers and pens, the Daddy Mountain is all pencil drawings.  It's a surprisingly effective technique.<br /><br />All in all, this is one of my favorite 2004 picture books ever.  It doesn't have anything particularly deep or meaningful to say.  It doesn't blow you away with its wisdom or artistic techniques.  It's simply a very funny, wry, remarkable little book.  Though I've just recommended it out the wazoo, I say to you the following:  I can't recommend it enough.  Give it a taste.rds, \\"I think she's going to faint\\") is promoting bad stereotypes.

Books	4	3	3	N	N	Your presence, not your presents is required	Some picture books find a variety of different ways to incorporate words from other languages into their text and pictures.  For example, Simms Taback's, \\"Joseph Had a Little Overcoat\\" cleverly combines Hebrew texts and pictures throughout the story.  I expected something similar with Cari Best's, \\"Three Cheers For Catherine the Great!\\" so I wasn't surprised when I came across pages where Russian script dots books and writings.  Though the cover illustration of this book initially gave me half a moment's concern (the characters in this story all sport thick eyebrows and slitted eyes that make them look more than a little devious) I found the story to be warm, inviting, and just a mite bit touching.  It's a beautiful tribute to one granddaughter's love of her grandmother.<br /><br />Sara has a slight problem.  It's her grandmother Catherine's birthday and the elder woman has made a very odd request.  For her party she has made it very clear that she would like a party of \\"no presents\\".  When confused by this request, Sara's mom explains that, \\"A good NO PRESENT can by anything from a kiss or a hug to a game of gin rummy\\".  This makes more sense to Sara, but she has some difficulty coming up with something.  After all, her downstairs neighbors know what they'll do.  So do her upstairs neighbors.  Finally, our heroine figures it out.  She knows the perfect gift to give to her grandmother.  One that will keep on giving and giving long after her birthday's past.<br /><br />The book summarizes neatly the experience many immigrants went through to come to the United States.  Catherine, it is explained, was known as Ekaterina and was renamed once she arrived in America.  Kids are allowed to draw their own conclusions on whether or not THAT was a good idea.  There's a nice bit of give and take between the neighbors of Sarah and Catherine herself.  I liked the relationship between the hair stylist father and his young daughter, for example.  The book seemed to display a gay father and his offspring in a clear accepting light.  The pictures in this story slowly grow on you.  Without reading the book they're initially a bit shocking.  Characters are never more frightening than when they smile, for some reason.  Yet these illustrations by Giselle Potter contain a great deal of love and affection in them.  From the cut-away expansive shots that reveal what each character is doing in his or her apartment to the playful illustrations of Sara playing Gypsy dress-up with her grandmother, these are calm lovely images.<br /><br />I recently read \\"Abuela\\" by Arthur Dorros, a story that is also about the close relationship between a grandmother and granddaughter.  Though this story lacks the visual punch of Dorros' creation, it contains the same touching affection between two vastly different generations.  For any family in which the grandparents are from another land, this book would make for fine reading.

Some people say that the leap taken by adult authors to writing books for children (Elmore Leonard, Michael Chabon, and Salman Rushdie are all good examples of this) is a harsh and difficult one.  I say a far more difficult leap is that from young adult author to children's.  Oh it may not sound difficult at first.  But where the adult-to-child author can fudge the ages of their readers, the young-adult-to-child author must be aware at all times of the specific mindset of their audience.  This may result in beautiful writing or watered down material that's too old for the intended audience.  Margaret Mahy is a premiere young adult author.  If you've any sense, you'll rush out and buy her \\"Catalogue of the Universe\\" at once without blinking.  What's most remarkable about Mahy though is her penchant for occasionally drifting into children's works as well.  These might range from the beautiful picture book, \\"Ultra-Violet Catastrophe\\" (a favorite of mine) to the slightly older chapter book, \\"The Haunting\\".  Like all her tales, \\"The Haunting\\" focuses on relationships between family members and the bond that ties us to our relatives.  It has the familiar creepy quality of her other works, but is age appropriate and (to be frank) thrilling.<br /><br />Barney has a problem.  He knows he's about to be haunted by a ghost and there's nothing he can do about it.  This isn't anything new for Barney, of course.  Years ago he was haunted by three different ghosts and they were all quite friendly.  Now, however, there's a blond boy in blue crushed velvet following him around and saying, \\"Barnaby's dead!  I'm going to be very lonely\\".  Since Barney's full name is Barnaby, he's not exactly pleased with this message.  Soon other strange things start to happen to the boy and his instincts tell him he's helpless in the face of them.  Fortunately, he has an incredibly loving family to rely on instead.  There's Clair, his beloved stepmother who is pregnant with her first child.  And there's his sister Tabitha, plump and happy and ready to talk a mile a minute.  There's Barney's father and his mysterious sister Troy who never says much but always seems to be most unhappy.  With the help of his family members, as well as an assortment of great-uncles, grandparents, and one wicked old great-grandmother, Barney slowly learns to unravel the mystery of what exactly is haunting him.<br /><br />More than any other children's author I've read, Margaret Mahy makes me want to quote long phrases of her prose to passing strangers on the street.  Just listen to some of the sentences in this book.  About Barney's evil great-grandma Scolar: \\"I don't mind her being wrinkled.... It's just that all her wrinkles are so angry.  She's like a wall with furious swear words scribbled all over it\\".  Or this section that describes the neatness of Troy's room: \\"Troy's homework was set out on her desk as immaculately as if she had been going to do a heart operation on it.  Her tiny writing ran across sheets of paper as if a regiment of minute insects with inky feet had marched with enormous precision over the pages\\".  Mahy's a master at the fabulous descriptive passage.  Her characters too are imbued with a kind of life and verve you only hope you could find in a good children's book.  Better still, they really like one another.  I mean, they're incredibly fond of one another's thoughts and feelings.  Most wonderful of all is Barney's pure unadulterated love for his stepmother.  He adores Clair with all his heart and constantly fears that she'll die in childbirth just as his mother did.  Most of the tension that comes from this book is based on characters keeping secrets from other characters because they don't want to hurt them.  Fortunately, everything gets patched up beautifully by the end.<br /><br />If you'd like a book for your kid that's slightly more advanced than the average \\"Super Diaper Baby\\" tale, try \\"The Haunting\\" out on them.  Not only is it written with clarityand precision but it's a great story about ghosts, magicians, and the dangers of stifling what you really are inside.  If you want an open-minded book that believes that people should be themselves, if in moderation, \\"The Haunting\\" is for you.  Another Margaret Mahy creation that'll blow you away.ith clarity and precision but it's a great story about ghosts, magicians, and the dangers of stifling what you really are inside.

I wish I had a better frame of reference, but until I discovered, \\"Sally Goes to the Mountains\\" I didn't know of any other good Lab-based picture books.  As it turns out, this particular picture book is one of many that chronicle the adventures of the oddly dour Sally.  Though the techniques that created the book are brimming with talent, the books themselves are a bit pat.  A lovely package that circles a so-so book.<br /><br />As the title suggests, this book is about Sally the dog and her trip to the mountains.  Based on scenery found on the author/illustrator's farm in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, the tale follows Sally as she meets and greets a variety of different birds and mammals in the wide-open wilderness.  Fortunately Sally isn't a chase-animals-and-eat-`em type.  She plays with the rabbits, has mind-numbingly repetitive conversations with a local owl, and dives into fresh fish-filled waters.  After seeing a bear munching berries off a bush, Sally appears to have a bizarre vision of utter frustration when she sees a bush growing dog food cans.  At this sight, it becomes clear that Sally has dreamed all her adventures and that she has only at that moment arrived in the mountains with her dog food bearing master.<br /><br />The book isn't afraid to fudge the occasional wilderness detail, I noticed.  In one panel Sally comes across a family of skunks which she calls, \\"very nice, except for one little stinker\\".  This skunk, according to the picture, sprays Sally.  I expected the next few pages to be a systematic cleaning of Sally in a bathtub full of tomato juice, but apparently neither she nor anyone else is particularly disturbed by the smell.  Odd that.  Then again, this is all supposed to be a dream, so how seriously can you take it?  The story itself is fine.  It's not really all that original.  But if you've a kid that's a dog lover (especially labs) they'll probably enjoy it.  And the art's lovely.  Top notch stuff.  The only problem with it, really, is that Sally looks morose 90% of the time.  With large bags under her eyes and a mouth that, when closed, is inclined to turn downwards, half of her pictures make her look as if she's on the verge of tears.  In an Artist's Note at the beginning of the book, Stephen Huneck gives a lovely description of the process he takes to create the story's woodcut look.  It's just odd then that Hueck should choose to give the world such a depressed heroine.  If you don't believe me, just check out the endpapers of Sally and some rabbits leaping across the pages.

But that's just my personal interpretation.<br /><br />All in all, this is a book with pretty packaging and not much in the way of story or character.  If you're a fan of new woodcut techniques, this may well be the book of your dreams.

FYI.riginal.  But if you've a kid that's a dog lover (especially labs) they'll probably enjoy it.  And the art's lovely.  Top notch stuff.  The only problem with it, really, is that Sally looks morose 90% of the time.  With large bags under her eyes and a mouth that, when closed, is inclined to turn downwards, half of her pictures make her look as if she's on the verge of tears.  In an Artist's Note at the beginning of the book, Stephen Huneck gives a lovely description of the process he takes to create the story's woodcut look.  It's just odd then that Hueck should choose to give the world such a depressed heroine.  If you don't believe me, just check out the endpapers of Sally and some rabbits leaping across the pages.  The rabbits look pleased with themselves and rabbitty.  The Sallys seem to be contemplating the nature of death and whether leaping like this has much of any point in such a cold cruel world.  But that's just my personal interpretation. <br />  <br />All in all, this is a book with pretty packaging and not much in the way of story or character.

For kids, even better than seeing a king and queen in court is the idea of being friends with them.  What child wouldn't want to be best buds with the country's highest rulers?  \\"May I Bring a Friend?\\" brings this idea radically to life.  Starring one small boy, it combines the I'm-Indispensable-To-Royal-Rulers fantasy with the I'm-Friends-With-An-Array-of-Furry-Animals fantasy.  It may not sound particularly promising, but the results are rather charming in the end.<br /><br />Our first shot in this book is an image of a small boy holding an envelope proudly above his head.  Says the text, \\"The King and Queen/ Invited me/ To come to their house/ On Sunday for tea\\". The boy is thrilled, but asks politely if he might bring a friend along.  The rulers are peachy keen with this idea, so it's a bit of a shock when they find that the boy's friend is a giraffe.  Still, all goes well.  Next, the King and Queen repeat their invitation, this time for breakfast.  The boy once more asks if a friend would be all right, they acquiesce, and lo and behold a hippo arrives and proceeds to eat all the food in sight.  The monarchs are a bit perturbed by this, but it doesn't seem to mar their friendship with the boy since they once again invite him back for a Monday stew dinner.  This time the boy brings monkeys.  You have the gist of the book.  Sometimes the boy brings lions, other times it's the odd elephant or seal.  Finally, after a final invitation, the boy says, \\"No, no!  My friends want you, instead/ To come and visit them...\\".  So King, Queen, and lad have tea at the City Zoo.  The final shot is of everyone in a bit cage, the royals hugging the boy who is grinning with glee.<br /><br />It wasn't the ending I'd expected.  That's the problem with reading a lot of snarky contemporary picture books.  After a while, you start anticipating twist endings, or stories with surprises at the finale.  I really thought the King and Queen would leave off inviting the boy to any more food-based parties, but they never did.  It's not as if they were always happy with the kid's guests either.  In a singularly interesting picture the boy has just brought along a whole pack of monkeys.  As the simians swing precariously on chandelier the royals sit there with looks of extreme unhappiness on their faces.  Only the boy (and the aforementioned monkeys) is looking particularly pleased.  Smashed dishes clutter the table. You have to wonder why the King and Queen didn't at least begin screening the boys' friends after this point.  Instead, it's quite the opposite.  The next invitation to the child reads, \\"The more friends you bring the better\\".  Odd but true.<br /><br />It's an interesting book apart from all this.  Overall the book rhymes regularly, but there's always the occasional extra word or two that makes the sentences jump about awkwardly.  As for the pictures, they vary from black and white, to a single bright color with black images, to pink/orange/yellow/purple/red/brown combinations of great eye-popping interest.  These pictures are always silly and rarely dull.  It's also a lot of fun to watch the King and Queen as they go about their daily business.  My favorite picture of them shows the King holding a skein of yarn for the Queen to roll into a ball.  It's sweet.<br /><br />This 1965 Caldecott Award winner is a deft little number.  It's not particularly original or different, but it certainly has its charms.  Kids who like a wide variety of animals (and the idea of playing with them in palaces) will take to this book.  It's not going to blow your pretty little mind or strike you as particularly earth-shattering but it's a good natured plucky book that has some fun with its ideas.  A nice addition to one's library.ught the King and Queen would leave off inviting the boy to any more food-based parties, but they never did.

471142:US	49148452	RFDZ8L17A65PD	0140562257	871088465	Abuela (English Edition with Spanish Phrases) (Picture Puffins)	Books	4	19	20	N	N	I want to fly like an eagle, to the sea	It's hard to resist the charms of a picture book filled to brimming with tiny fabulous details in a vast cityscape.  It's probably one of the reasons I love books like, \\"Who Needs Donuts?\\" by Mark Stamaty or James Warhola's, \\"Uncle Andy's\\" so much.  Usually books of this nature are very precise.  They hide delicate little intricacies on each and every page, just waiting for the viewer to find them.  Yet I've never read a picture book that contains such remarkably colorful embellishments as I have in Arthur Dorros' 1991 treasure, \\"Abuela\\". Taking a standard fantasy of wishing to fly, author Dorros and illustrator Elisa Kleven have given us a remarkable journey above a world too complex to capture in a single book.  To read this book is to experience something beautiful.<br /><br />Rosalba is quite close to her Grandmother or \\"Abuela\\" as she is called in Spanish.  The two often go on enjoyable trips around and about town, just for the heck of it.  On this particular day, the woman and the girl go to the park (Central Park, by the look of it) to feed the birds.  It's there that Rosalba begins to speculate a little.  What if the birds picked her up and started flying away with her?  What if her Abuela simply leapt into the sky and flew too?  The birds gone, the two could soar above factories, trains, people, and workers.  What follows is a story in which Rosalba describes the path the two could take while skimming across the sky.  They wave to the people and visit the Statue of Liberty.  They race the sailboats, hitch a ride with an airplane, and hug on a cloud.  In the end, the two are back in the park and they decide to go on another adventure in a boat.  \\"Vamos\\" Abuela says, and she takes her granddaughter's hand.<br /><br />There are quite a few remarkable Spanish/English picture books out there in the world today.  One of the best, without question, is L.M. Gonzalez's, \\"The Bossy Gallito\\".  But \\"Abuela\\" is just as good in many ways.  There's a helpful dictionary of Spanish to English terms for those words and phrases in the text that kids (or adults) didn't quite understand.  The story itself is well told, though its definitely left unclear whether or not the fantastic events that take place in this book are true or false.  Aside from that, it's a great text, remenicient of Faith Ringgold's other kids-flying-above-New-York picture book, \\"Tar Beach\\".  A pairing of the two during a storytime would not be out of place.<br /><br />When I write reviews of picture books, this paragraph tends to be the space where I say something along the lines of \\"Of course the book itself would be nothing without the pictures\\".  \\"Abuela\\" is no different and though it may seem a little repetitive, I say it again.  The illustrations in this book are remarkable.  What caught me off guard was the level of detail and the multitude of colors and fabrics lining the corners and seams of every page.  This is perhaps the most subtle picture book I have ever seen in terms of how it uses mixed media.  While some books throw fabrics and other elements into their pictures in a distinctly slap-dash fashion, \\"Abuela\\" subtley works them into the context of the illustrations without distracting you or drawing your eye away from the action.  Whether it's Abuela's purple dotted purse or the fabric crested tops of buildings, the mixed-media here is perfectly melded to the story.  Then there are the thousands of details lining each and every page.  Plus the fact that everything is bright, colorful, and lively without ever straying into gaudy territory.  Finally, illustrator Elisa Kleven has imbued her main character with a great deal of liveliness.  Rosalba and her Abuela dip and dive and swoop with perfect grace and poise.  If humans could fly, this is the best possible way they could look in sky.<br /><br />It is not possible to be disappointed with \\"Abuela\\".  The book is a fun fancy-free encapsulation of the ultimate flight of fancy.  Kids that read this tale willbe envious of Rosalba and her beloved grandmother.  Adults will coo at the pretty pictures and helpful text.  A beautiful story unencumbered by weight or gravity.  Lovely.s tale will be envious of Rosalba and her beloved grandmother.

473004:US	49148452	R32ZPCECVUVWIE	0399242694	354922640	Mister Seahorse	Books	4	37	43	N	N	The best dad in Davy Jones' locker	I think I am right in saying that Eric Carle is the most popular children's picture book artist living today that eschews the universal convention of facial expressions.  Not every illustrator in the world could get away with it.  Carle has sort of established a whole new placid unemotional genre all on his own.  Consider, if you will, \\"The Hungry Hungry Caterpillar\\" who shows one brief moment of bellyache related pain before bursting from his cocoon to become a beautiful unexpressive butterfly.  For my own part, this disregard of facial expressions is hard to get through.  In one of his latest offerings, \\"Mister Seahorse\\", Carle tackles the weighty subject of a father's responsibility to his kin.  Since I like this book more than some of Carle's others, I suggest you take the hero's nonplussed attitude as merely a realistic representation of real seahorses in the wild.<br /><br />One day, Mrs. Seahorse becomes preggers.  As is the seahorse custom, she promptly deposits her eggs in Mr. Seahorse's pouch.  With the eggs safely ensconced there, Mr. Seahorse goes about his daily rounds.  While out, he comes across Mr. Stickleback, Mr. Tilapia, Mr. Kurtus, Mr. Pipe, and Mr. Bullhead.  Each fish has his own distinct way of caring for his born and unborn young.  For example, Mr. Bullhead baby-sits (admittedly, Carle could have used a better term for this) his newborn hatchlings while Mr. Tilapia carries his young's eggs around in his mouth.  Kids reading this book with their parents have the added pleasure of watching Mr. Seahorse as he approaches single fishies hiding in seaweed, behind coral reefs, and in small patches of reeds.  In these scenes the page becomes translucent plastic, the reeds, reefs, and seaweed a beautifully painted scene overlaying the action.  In the end, Mr. Seahorse's eggs hatch and as one of his little offspring attempts to go back to the pouch he remarks affectionately, \\"I do love you, but now you are ready to be on your own\\".  Hence the popularity this book has enjoyed as a newfound graduation present for high school Seniors everywhere.<br /><br />On the back of the book, Carle posts a note that explains how in most fish families eggs are left on their own.  This book encompasses the exceptions to that rule, going as far as to show that the father is the main parent in certain cases.  Rare but true.  The premise is irresistable.  One that I'm sure several children's authors are probably kicking themselves for not having thought of on their own first.  Flipping through the story, Carle has passed over his normal palette of bright primary colors for deft pastel watercolors.  They're still exciting to look through, but there's a definite underwater feel to the luminous pinks, blues, greens and oranges that abound here.  According to the book, the art was done in painted tissue-paper collage.  The result is a deft interweaving of crinkly creatures in soothing but lively shades.<br /><br />There is, of course, the writing itself to contend with.  Now I'm saying right here and now that this book's premise is good and its art is good.  No arguments there.  But there's just not much of a plot.  It's a simple formulation of \\"Mr. Seahorse goes here, sees this, goes there, talks to that\\" repeated roughly four times.  Characters do not smile.  They speak without a conjunction in sight.  It's all lovely to look at and your first reading of the book will be delighted.  Your second reading will be a smidgen repetitive, but you'll still love the pretty pictures.  And by reading number fifteen you'll begin to wonder why Mr. Seahorse didn't have a little more fun with his eggs.  Or ask other fathers more questions.  Or even crack a joke once in a while.  These complaints, I should admit, are more to do with Eric Carle's writing style and less the flaws of this book in particular.  Still, though this book is a beautiful story, it leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good science-based book with excellent information about underwater creatures and an interesting series of facts about male fishies, there are few books better than, \\"Mr. Seahorse\\".  If you want a story about a father saying goodbye to his offspring and letting them out into the world, \\"Mr. Seahorse\\" is your best bet.  And if you want a book that is beautiful to look at and contains unparalled watercolors and nifty tricks to make you feel as if you too are under the sea, give it up for, \\"Mr. Seahorse\\".  But if you want an underwater tale with oomph and pizzazz, choose Leo Lionni's, \\"Swimmy\\".  This book is far better than \\"Rainbow Fish\\", but it still lacks the spirit of little red \\"Swimmy\\".  In the end, it's an excellent tale in some respects and a mediocre one in others.  Depending on what you hope to get out of your picture books, it should satisfy or disappoint you as much as you like.  I enjoyed it.  Not everyone would.ased book with excellent information about underwater creatures and an interesting series of facts about male fishies, there are few books better than, \\"Mr. Seahorse\\".

Having decided to conquer the world of cats as well as the world of mice (if this statement confuses you a single glimpse of \\"Lily's Purple Plastic Purse\\" should explain what I mean), Henkes has shifted his focus squarely on a small hungry kitten.  Inviting child audiences to simultaneously pity and scoff (nicely) at its small mistaken heroine, the story is about a feline that tries to capture the moon, but is happy enough in the end with a simple bowl of milk.<br /><br />Kitten, we take it, is not very old.  In fact, for the first time ever she's experiencing her first full moon.  Apparently no one thought to explain to Kitten exactly what a moon is and since her only frame of reference for a large round white thing is a bowl of milk, that's exactly what she mistakes the moon to be.  What follows is a series of mild calamities as Kitten tries time and again to reach that tempting bowl of milk in the sky.  Simply sticking her tongue out doesn't work.  She gets fireflies stuck there.  Leaping at the moon from the house's steps doesn't work.  She just bumps her bum.  Chasing the moon over hill and dale doesn't work.  Kitten can't help but notice that she never gets closer.  After other mistakes Kitten, dejected and more than a little soggy, returns home to find an inviting bowl of milk sitting on her home's steps just for her.  Says the last line in the book, \\"Lucky Kitten\\".<br /><br />The illustrations in this book are, in a word, luminous.  Somehow Henkes has taken somewhat bland black and grey gouache and colored pencils and used them to give the impression of a world bathed in shimmering moonlight.  Kitten herself is a lovely innocent little creature.  There are some truly amusing moments when she finds that she's just been tricked in some way.  In times like these her mouth pretty much disappears and her eyes become wide, staring straight at the reader.  It's a brilliant comic effect, and it keeps you rooting for Kitten.  If there's anything to beware of in this book it may be your children over identifying with the little cat.  I know that I, for one, felt awful for her when she found herself floating in a pond (she saw the reflection of the moon in the pond and thought... well, you know) and, \\"was wet and sad and tired and hungry\\".  Fortunately Kitten's happy ending is just a few pages away, so kids won't have much time to dwell on the unhappy heroine's predicament.<br /><br />The book is not too unlike one of my favorite picture books from childhood.  Like, \\"The Patchwork Cat\\" by Nicola Bayley & William Mayne, this book is about a cat attempting to find and recover the thing she loves best.  The two books would pair brilliantly together for any storytime.  Henkes has redirected his storylines from rodents to cats so well that I suspect his fans won't be clamoring for any more mousie tales for quite some time.  If you'd like a picture book that is as beautiful as it is misleadingly simple, \\"Kitten's First Full Moon\\" is your best bet.

Still, if you go into a book with lowered expectations, you can only be delighted when you find them to be baseless.  My experiences with some of the early Caldecott winning books, like \\"Mei Li\\", have sometimes ranged from gagging horror to outright shock.  Looking at \\"Mei Li\\", I wasn't hopeful.  It was written originally in 1939.  It takes place in China with a Chinese heroine.  All signs seemed to say that this book had prime racism potential.  So imagine my delight and astonishment when I discovered it to be a fair treatment of a rural Chinese family existing in the 1930s.  Sure, it had some elements here and there that I would have liked to have corrected, but on the whole it's a sure-footed interesting book.  One of those rare Caldecott winners you can still read to your little ones today.<br /><br />Mei Li is not at all pleased.  Her brother San Yu is going to the New Year Fair in the city and, because she is a girl, Mei Li must stay home.  Fortunately, she's a fairly enterprising little lass and by bribing her brother with her lapis-blue marble she's able to convince him to take her with him to town as well.  Once there she gives some money to a begger girl and partakes of the splendors of the city.  After competing with her brother to show him that girls can do just as much as boys can, she stumbles across a fortune teller.  The man predicts that she will rule over a kingdom, a fate which even the normally optimistic Mei Li has some doubts about.  After dressing up, playing with toys, and escaping from realistic flying kites she returns to her home with her brother and uncle.  That night, she greets the Kitchen God and is told that her home is her kingdom and in it everyone is her loyal loving subject.  Says Mei Li with a bit of common sense, \\"It will do for a while, anyway\\".<br /><br />It's an odd kind of story, really.  The narrative jumps wildly from place to place to place.  One minute Mei Li's being held upside down by a female acrobat and the next she's created a crown out of her green marble and is prancing about like a princess.  Her brother, San Yu, is also a realistically cruel older brother.  In fact, he doesn't seem to much care what or where his sister gets to.  This guy sneers, mocks, jeers, and generally makes his little sister's life a misery.  Pretty realistic stuff.  For her part, Mei Li is the ultimate likable protagonist.  There's nothing she does that other little girls wouldn't do in her place.  Along with that, she never really gets particularly upset with her older brother.<br /><br />I was a little surprised to find that the author and illustrator of this book were one and the same.  Where the plot and narrative of this book is lightheared and wild, the pictures convey that silliness but also have a wry realism about them.  Everything here is drawn in black and white.  This is a real pity when you consider that Mei Li goes about carrying three brightly colored marbles, \\"one lapis blue, one coral red, and one jade green\\".  It would have been nice to see those bright stones, as well as the colors that obviously pervade the Fair.  The book also contains some incredibly realistic figures.  Mei Li is often drawn with a deftly shaded and sly face, both adorable and pitiable depending on the situation.  Sometimes the pictures in this book are cartooney.  Sometimes they're blasts of brief shocking realism.  For my own part, I think the best part of this book is the moment when an old priest lays below a bridge urging the children above to, \\"Ring the bell with a penny, and you will have money for all the year\\".  In the picture, the priest lies with huge piles of pennies around him.  His face is undeniably European and one clawed hand reaches out to greedily gather the money to him.  I couldn't help but wonder if Handforth was trying to make a statement of some sort with this picture.  Probably not, but it's fun to speculate all the same.<br /><br />So is the book offensive?  I'm probably not the one to ask.  I don't know my Chinese history particularly well, so I can't say whether or not the book is a faithful and accurate reprentation of the China of that time.  The book doesn't really mention the name of the city presented here, so there's that.  There is a map of the town, Mei Li's home, and its approximate closeness to the Great Wall of China, which is interesting.  But the pictures do not promote stock Oriental images and the text is fully respectful of its characters.  On the whole, I would say that this is a fair balanced book with a great deal of love poured into it.<br /><br />If you find that you would like to read an older Caldecott winning book, but you're not entirely certain where to start, \\"Mei Li\\" is probably your best bet.  At once winning, charming, and altogether intelligent, it still has the power to interest the children that read it.  Maybe the best word of all for it is: timeless.  Sure, it's definitely set in 1939 China, but the images and story presented here will last for all time.

Brian Karas captured the world's attention with his not-particularly-groundbreaking-but-still-interesting, \\"Muncha Muncha Muncha\\" he helped author Lenny Hort create a sweet little selection entitled, \\"The Seals On the Bus\\".  Taking silliness to a whole new level, \\"Seals\\" replaces those tired old standby lines found in the song, \\"The Wheels On the Bus\\" and replaces them with a convoluted carnival of copious critters.  It's silly, frenetic, and thoroughly enjoyable to the kiddies.<br /><br />A small family of four wait patiently at a bus stop.  The kids are unencumbered and their parents read their book and newspaper respectively.  Once on the bus, however, everything goes higgledy-piggledy.  First some seals come on board (accompanied by the text, \\"The seals on the bus go errp, errp, errp\\").  I've always thought that seals were prone to more arfing than errping, but that's just me I guess.  Suddenly the seals' boisterous errps make the driver more than a little angry.  The driver, to the surprise of his human passengers, is actually a tiger.  So the text says, \\"The tiger on the bus goes roar, roar, roar\\".  This is where things start picking up.  Geese jump aboard the bus, with the appropriate geese sounds in tow.  Next come rabbits.  Then monkeys, then vipers, then sheep.  In a way, it's the final skunks that push the grownups completely off the deep end.  Fortunately, at this point the bus as ended at a fabulous party and the kids are more than happy to join in the fun.<br /><br />Lenny Hort is the official author of this tale, and it's a funny enough concept I'll grant you.  Still, it's Karas who brings the entire enterprise to full glorious life.  I wasn't a particular fan of his work on \\"Muncha Muncha Muncha\\", I'll admit.  Maybe that was because he didn't include any seals.  Cause let's face it, the man is an excellent seal-artist.  The book itself has a kind of faux sloppiness to it.  At first, it looks like the pictures were just randomly brought together.  But on closer inspection it's clear that Karas uses his gouache, acrylics, pencils and cut paper to the best of his ability.  I was particularly interested in how the buildings and reading materials in this story were created out of real honest-to-goodness newsprint.  Partly these amused me because Karas would carefully smudge important names on that newsprint.  Partly they amused me because they were often ads of boring grown-up business/stock information (apropos when using that same material to create houses and buildings).  As for the characters themselves, Karas is far better at drawing animals than people.  In \\"Muncha\\" this was a problem.  Here, it's an advantage.  You may notice the family from time to time, but the real heroes of this tale are the myriad of different animals filling each and every page.  And great seals.  Great great seals.<br /><br />All in all, \\"The Seals On the Bus\\" takes an old song, modernizes it with silly and ridiculous images, and has a great time doing it.  Consequently, your kids will have a ball reading it.  And if you happen to be the kind of adult that can repeat the words, \\"Errp, errp, errp\\", over and over with the right amount of aplomb and humor, this will become your children's favorite bedtime story of the year.

477021:US	49148452	R258Y0UV58PLJI	0440416051	698531635	Kit's Wilderness	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Blood on the coal	I remember reading David Almond's first children's book, \\"Skellig\\" and being vaguely impressed.  The book had some interesting ideas and the author was obviously adept at tying in different running themes throughout the book's narrative.  This seemed to be his strong point and, I suspect, the reason his books are so often chosen to be read by kids in school.  But nothing in \\"Skellig\\" really blew me away.  I mean, it was nice but a little overdone.  The character of Skellig himself was fascinating, but I didn't particularly care much for the other people in the story.  All in all, it had the distinct feel of a first work.  Then I heard a great deal of good things about Almond's second book, \\"Kit's Wilderness\\".  Under the mistaken impression that the book was a Holocaust novel (a quick glance of the cover is enough to explain where I got that particular idea) I picked it up and quickly devoured it.  To my delight, the book is incredibly strong.  Almond has retained his love of grand all encompassing themes, and fit them within the confines of a small perfect novel.  \\"Kit's Wilderness\\" is a remarkably strong creation.<br /><br />The death of Kit's grandmother brings the boy and his family to the coal-mining town of Stoneygate to live.  For generations Kit's family has lived and worked in the dark dangerous coal filled caverns beneath the ground.  With his grandfather's failing health on his mind, Kit finds himself drawn to fellow student and dark ally John Askew.  John and Kit share ancient ancestors in the mines and both are drawn to the darkest parts of their own souls.  With John as a guide, Kit and a few chosen others (including the light and bright Allie Keenan) play a primal game called Death that allows them to experience one of humanity's oldest mysteries.  When the game is found out, John turns on the world and Kit must use all his resources to draw his friend and his grandfather out of the dark and back into the light of life.<br /><br />Playing with images of mines, death, nothingness, cavemen, ancient primordial creatures, and the nature of human evil, the book skillfully ties together a number of fascinating themes.  Almond is at his best with this book.  Having grown up in his own northeastern English mining village, he knows from which he speaks.  You never really fear that Kit will become as enraptured with the notion of death as Askew is, but neither does he fully embrace the life around him as Allie does.  It's only when he begins to write his own stories (including an all-encompassing tale of a prehistoric boy named Lak) that he gains some perspective on himself and his dark-obsessed friend.  Kit's ability to see the ghosts of the past, ghosts so far reaching that he actually meets and interacts with his caveman's mother, is both metaphor and the true soul of the tale.  With so many different threads of plot and action circling about this book, I wouldn't have blamed Almond at all if he'd dropped the ball in some way.  Instead, he deftly maintains each storyline perfectly, tying them all together at the end.  It's enough to take your breath away.<br /><br />In many ways, \\"Kit's Wilderness\\" reminded me greatly of Alan Garner's 1976 classic, \\"The Stone Book\\", which also tied the beginnings of life to the nature of life on earth and the working man's lot.  If you've enjoyed \\"Kit's Wilderness\\" then Garner's classic text is an obvious companion piece.  I was greatly relieved to find \\"Kit's\\" such an enjoyable read as well.  Almond's evocative reminices of snow and frozen winter reminded me of the best parts of \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\".  In the end, the book is about living life and how we as humans can't help but be drawn to its absence sometimes.  This book is about our fascination with the horrific and what it takes to grab onto living.

It'll capture your attention and allow me to get something off my chest.  I've noticed that if you tell children's literature professionals that you think it would be a good idea to take old picture books and liven them up with brand new illustrations by contemporary illustrators, they look at you like you've just suggested burning the collected works of Dr. Seuss.  Which is to say, they look at you like you're insane.  This isn't to say this practice isn't done from time to time.  For example, illustrator David McPhail (for reasons I don't even want to contemplate) thought it might be a good idea to reillustrate Beatrix Potter's, \\"The Tale of Peter Rabbit\\".  Usually, I think re-illustrating old classics is a bad idea.  By and large, it's a dangerous practice that should be avoided.  Then I read \\"White Snow, Bright Snow\\".  This is a Caldecott winning book that is a fabulous read.  I've rarely read a picture book that so beautifully captures the feeling you get when the world is first blanketed in a thick covering of fluffy white snow.  Author Alvin Tresselt's words are some of the most beautiful you'll read, which makes it that much more of a pity that the illustrator on this book was Roger Duvoisin.  I know many of you remember this book from your youth and I know many more would beat me with sticks for suggesting anything at all be changed about this wonderful tale.  But honestly, let's look at it again in a clear light.  I can't help but think new illustrations would suit this puppy perfectly.<br /><br />In this story, author Tresselt gives us several different impressions and reactions to the coming of wintertide.  As the sky looms dark and heavy with unfallen snow, a postman, a farmer, and a policeman and his wife all decide in their own separate ways that flakes are imminent.  Heck, even the rabbits and the children are waiting for it to happen.  \\"Then, just when no one was looking, it came\\".  Snow means new boots for the postman and extra shoveling for the farmer.  Snow means the policeman gets to soak his feet in hot water as his wife rubs mustard plaster into his chest (don't ask).  Snow means the children can make snowmen, snow houses, and snow forts before throwing snowball fights.  In time though, the snow drifts away and spring is coming again.  The last image of the book is of the children watching the first robin who tells them that spring has really come.<br /><br />Unlike most picture books written today (I hesitate to say all, but that's my impression), this book contains long wordy passages on one page facing a single illustration on the other.  This would be tiresome if the passages weren't so well written.  Just listen to this: \\"In the morning a clear blue sky was overhead and blue shadows hid in all the corners. Automobiles looked like big fat raisins buried in snowdrifts.  Houses crouched together, their windows peeking out from under great white eyebrows\\".  Even if you've never seen the effect of snow on a landscape, these lines are evocative enough to make you wish you had.  Moreover, they summarize perfectly what the world looks like on a clear sunny morning after a heavy snow.  So hats off to Tresselt.  Hats off indeed.  I only wish illustrator Roger Duvoisin could fill me with half as much awe and wonder.  Duvoisin's illustrations are, in and of themselves, fine.  I mean, there's nothing particularly bad about them.  I liked the distinctly 1940s images (the policeman's wife wears some pretty hip dresses).  I liked the image of the policeman twirling his baton.  But these pictures suffer from a kind of messy skewed perspective.  In context, they work.  Yet after reading Tresselt's lovely passages, you find yourself yearning for lovely illustrations.  Illustrations that are not forthcoming.  I'm not asking for anything spectacular, but the green, yellow, orange, red-orange, yellow-green, and grey pictures (I've just listed the entirecolor scheme) are sometimes lovely and sometimes dull as dishwater.<br /><br />So, as I said before, I make the sacrilegious suggestion that we ask another illustrator to try his or her hand on this book.  Duvoisin's pictures are fine in and of themselves and I've little doubt that there are adults out there who read this book as children and would bludgeon me with stones for such an idea.  Still, the words are so lovely, you can't help but want to pair them with pretty pictures.  For an especially good storytime, consider pairing this book with the far more contemporary but no less adept \\"Snow Music\\" by Lynne Rae Perkins.  Together, the two books capture every essence of what it means to live in a world of snowy whiteness.  A great companion to the winter season.entire color scheme) are sometimes lovely and sometimes dull as dishwater.   <br /> <br />So, as I said before, I make the sacrilegious suggestion that we ask another illustrator to try his or her hand on this book.

Perhaps the best example of this is the highly readable and talented Amelia Atwater-Rhodes.  Born in 1984 (you do the math) her first book was published when she was a mere slip of a lass of thirteen years.  With \\"Hawksong\\" she's reached the wise old age of nineteen, though you'd never know it from reading the book.  Atwater-Rhodes is prone to over-formal sentences, familiar if limited plots, and sometimes stock characters but \\"Hawksong\\" withstands these criticisms and remains interesting and (in its way) original reading.<br /><br />It's like Romeo and Juliet.  Only in this case, Romeo hates Juliet, Juliet fears Romeo, and the two are only getting together for political reasons.  Danica is the last surviving heir to her people's throne.  As an Avian, she and her people have the ability to transform into various winged fowl, sometimes completely and sometimes only by half.  They have been at war longer than they know with the Serpiente people.  Led by Zane Cobriana, these are the Avians' snake enemies.  In a desperate effort to create a new peace in the land, Zane and Danica decide to wed, thereby creating a political marriage between their warring tribes.  The trouble is, of course, that these two can't stand one another.  Also, it's clear that a centuries-long war isn't about to end just because two optimistic kids decide to dedicate their lives to it.  To make the peace survive this new pair must address dissent, learn to appreciate one another, and sniff out the assassins that keep attempting to kill them.<br /><br />It's nice to read a kind of anti-love story once in a while.  Atwater-Rhodes also has the wit to write a realistic enough war without making Zane/Danica's solution instant and tidy.  War's a messy business, and some of the most convincing moments in the book come when Danica must face potential mutiny in her hepped-up-ready-to-fight recruits and soldiers.  The love story that slowly emerges between the two heroes is slow but, sadly, a little predictable.  I found myself, oddly enough, comparing it constantly to the story of Beauty and the Beast (another tale where the girl fears the man and then comes to love him).  It was disappointing to say to one's self \\"I wonder when the moment will come when one has to nurse the other back to health\\" and then actually see it occur.  None of this to degrade Atwater-Rhodes's work, however.  Though the book, as I've said earlier, is somewhat repetitive and familiar, it's still an interesting read.  The author has filled it full with little touches and interesting ideas.  The Serpiente, for example, are (despite what you may think) very touch oriented and warm to one another in their society.  Emotional creatures, if you will.  The Avian, on the other hand, do not touch and are particularly aloof and formal.  It was Atwater-Rhodes's intelligence that told her to make her heroine (and narrator) come from the cool collected side and not the warm emotional one.  By extension, the book is far more interesting.<br /><br />It must be particularly frustrating to all the terrible fantasy authors out there that someone like Amelia Atwater-Rhodes has accomplished, prior to the ancient age of 21, what they themselves have been unable to attain.  Which is to say, she writes good fantasy.  Not particularly original or deep fantasy, but fantasy with enough reality and interesting ideas that it's worth your while to read.  \\"Hawksong\\" is a fun dive into an entirely different world.  It won't knock your socks off but it'll give you pause and win your respect.  I went into the book hoping it wouldn't make me cringe due to the writing.  Not only didn't I cringe, but it won my respect.  An interesting creation.moments in the book come when Danica must face potential mutiny in her hepped-up-ready-to-fight recruits and soldiers.

When their small ward picks it up and offers it to them, there is sometimes a definite pause before the parent says aloud, \\"Wait... unauthorized autobiography?  That's not possible\\".  It's one of the perks of my job.  I first bought and read this book in 2002 after reading only four books in \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\".  I can tell you right here and now that that was a huge mistake.  Not the buying the book part, but the reading it after having only reviewed four of the books in the series.  I've since then read the rest of the books currently published and, prior to reading this, I suggest you do the same.  Though the book will make a bit of sense here and there, you're really only going to understand it fully after you've at least gotten through, \\"The Slippery Slope\\".  Just a warning.<br /><br />Now this book is unlike any other you're likely to come across.  And though paperback editions of this puppy exist, I'm telling you right here and now that it is worth the extra money to buy the hardback.  If you get the paperback you're missing out on one of the greatest publishing operations available to child readers everywhere.  The cover of this book is reversible so that if your enemies should notice it in your hands, you can make them think that you're simply perusing Lenoy M. Setnick's, \\"The Pony Party\\" (part of \\"The Luckiest Kids in the World!\\" series).  Inside, the book's a devilishly clever collection of stories, bits of correspondance, burned newspaper articles, lost telegrams, and various mysterious photographs.  Kids who crack the book's codes, hints, and family trees will begin to understand a lot more about the people the Baudelaires have been in contact with over the years.  Did you know that Esme Squalor only married Jerome because of where he lived?  Or that Mr. Poe has a sister that caused Lemony his job?  Did you know that the film, \\"Zombies in the Snow\\", may have contained a hidden message that Uncle Monty completely missed in Book #2?<br /><br />For adults like myself, the book is just as wildly interesting as it is to kids.  Adults will probably get a lot more of the in-jokes, though.  In a photograph of a ship's crew, every sailor has the name of a famous children's author.  I think I only caught on when I read the name of Sailor Creech next to Sailor Danzinger.  There's even a transcript of the moment the schism arose in V.F.D. in the first place.  Most impressive of all, oddly, is the index in the back.  If you've the time and inclination, a careful inspection of it will reveal further clues to the Baudelaire/Snicket/Quagmire drama.  I also loved the fact that the photographs in the book range wildly in time and era.  Most of them seem to originate in 1932, but there are 1960s shots, Victorian era prints, and some pictures of Lemony that must have been made relatively recently.  Heck, even the publication page in the front of the book reveals tiny statements and clues for people to pore through.  It's an intense experience, reading this book.<br /><br />I think the real lure of V.F.D., as shown in this book, is that anyone can join regardless of age.  And that may be where the real intrugue for kids lies.  Children who've always wanted to belong to a secret spy organization and who love \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\" will probably read this book to shreds.  They'll get the references.  They'll understand the nuances.  They'll be the most appreciative of audiences.  But it is absolutely imperitive that you read the other books first.  This isn't your standard story with a beginning, a middle, and an end.  It's more like a collection of mismatched documents all working together to give kids some insight into a thirteen volume mystery.  It's a truly enjoyable experience..

482375:US	49148452	R26M7ZCPL9OCZ1	0375822739	176879219	The City of Ember: The First Book of Ember	Books	4	28	34	N	N	When love was an ember about to billow	I'm working as hard as I possibly can to become the number one expert in post-apocalyptic children's books.  It's a tough job, but somebody's gotta do it.  In the course of my futuristic/distopia-laden reading list, I found that I would be amiss if I didn't read Jeanne DuPrau's 2003 popular puppy, \\"City of Ember\\".  Drawing on elements from books as widely divergent as Lois Lowry's, \\"The Giver\\" to Neal Shusterman's less well-known, \\"Downsiders\\", the book contains an interesting look into the life of a community that has forgotten for 200 some years that it's living in a bunker.<br /><br />As every good schoolchild in Ember knows, their city, \\"is the only light in the dark world.  Beyond Ember, the darkness goes on forever in all directions\\".  In a town lit solely by electric lights, the people of Ember know relatively little about the city's history.  They know that it was created two hundred some years ago by the Builders and was provided with everything the people might need.  But only recently has this small civilization become imperiled by its inability to be self-sufficent.  Power outages result in the lights going out periodically with total terrifying darkness sweeping the land.  Food and other supplies seem to be running scarce and Ember is becoming victim to hoarders and thieves.  Young Lina and Doon seem to be the only people in town who want to find a way out of Ember, if it's at all possible.  When Lina's grandmother unwittingly unearths ancient instructions for leaving the city, it's up to the two children to go where no one else in Ember has ever gone.  Over the river and into the light.<br /><br />In many ways, \\"The City of Ember\\" reminded me of \\"Noah's Castle\\" by John Rowe Townsend.  The lessons about hoarding food and what a single person owes their community come up in both books regularly.  \\"Ember\\" also bears significant similarities to other futuristic distopia worlds like those found in the aforementioned \\"The Giver\\" and Zilpha Keatley Snyder's, \\"Below the Root\\".  Like those books, this one begins with a pre-adolescent attending an important meeting than will determine their future career.  Like those books, the hero's innocence is destroyed when they discover the secret and ugly inner workings of the town.  There were a lot of original things in this books as well, however.  I liked the idea that Ember was constantly afraid that someday their city's lights would go off and they'd be plunged in darkness forever.  I was incredibly grateful that as an author DuPrau resisted the temptation to include a stereotypical wise blind person in the text who teaches the children how to be brave (trust me, it would've been easy to do).  There was the clever fact that all foods grown in Ember were, essentially, tubers.  I loved the anticipation I felt as I followed Lina and Doon through deciphering the ancient instructions (kids who like books that contain clues and codes will appreciate that aspect of the story) and finally into a whole new world.  In these ways, the author was adept at her story.  In other ways, less so.<br /><br />To be honest, DuPrau isn't a fan of details.  Which is to say, some of the finer aspects of the city of Ember are left totally unexplained.  Why, for example, hasn't overpopulation ever been a problem or even addressed?  How could a group of people, even if they've been entirely cut off from the known world, not discover the finer aspects of fire in the course of their 250 some years underground?  Heck, I'd think that would be a primary concern for the local scientists!  And where are the dead buried?  And how do these primitive doctors deal with birth and surgery?  These may appear to be extraneous questions, but the very nature of the world of Ember makes you think them up!  I know I keep citing other books, but the problems I had with this story mimicked the problems I had with a fellow post-apocalyptic tale, \\"The Girl Who Owned a City\\" by O.T. Nelson.  \\"The City of Ember\\" skimped on thedetails of its world.

The only reason I searched out read this book was because it has the legitimate honor of being the first Caldecott winning picture book... ever.  And truth be told, that's probably why you've just looked it up on Amazon.com too.  Admit it.  You wanted to know what made this story so special that it garnered the first in a line of many prestigious works of literature.  What is it about this book that's so special?  How has it fared over the years?  Heck, what kind of book is it anyway?  Well, I'll simplify things for you a tad.  First of all, the title is about as straightforward as possible.  \\"Animals of the Bible\\" is pretty much just that.  Picture of animals mentioned in both the Old and New Testaments with accompanying quotes from both books.  You can't get any more basic.<br /><br />The book begins (or at least my copy did) with a Forward from Helen Dean Fish, the woman responsible for choosing the biblical passages included in this book (coming from the King James Bible, no less).  The Forward explains how Fish always wanted to compile a book such as this one due to the fact that there are so many interesting and inspiring psalms, stories, and scriptures that mention or reflect on those members of the animal kingdom.  The book itself covers everything from the serpent in the garden to the cock that crowed three times for Peter.  I was a little disappointed that there weren't any Revelation beasties (nine headed critters and all that), but that's just me.  Illustrator Dorothy P. Lathrop is probably the real reason the book won anything at all, though.  After studying the landscape of the Holy Land and animal physiology, Lathrop developed lovely pen & ink (and possibly pencil) drawings of a variety of different scenes.  Though the pictures do not accompany every quote or verse in this book, they make up a large portion of the text.<br /><br />If you get this book out to read to your little ones, don't expect a watered down King James Bible transcript to greet you.  These puppies are long and wordy.  I still don't think I fully understood the \\"David Saves His Sheep From a Lion and a Bear\\" part.  Too dense for me and, by extension, probably a tad dense for your little ones.  Be prepared to do all the readings.  The pictures themselves are touch and go.  Though Lathrop is excellent at dumb beasts, she's less skilled at human beings.  In fact, some of the humans in this book have a kind of Art Deco look to them.  All slitted eyes and sharp noses.  Still, the pictures are rather nice and even include gigantic water serpents.  Apparently a leviathan is a giant sea snake.  Who knew?  It seems this book still has something to teach us.  Again, I was sorry to see that there wasn't a picture for every quote in this book.  And in the pictures where a group of different animals saunter and carouse, Lathrop seems to have just drawn them separately without considering how they'd interact.<br /><br />If you're just looking for a black and white picture book of word for word Bible quotes, \\"Animals of the Bible\\" has your ticket.  Some of the individual tales here (such as Noah and his arc) have since been made into stunning picture books in their own right.  I suggest you seek those out rather than force your children to sit and read this thick tomed puppy for hours on end.  As a historical document it's particularly interesting, but I just don't know how many kids would get into it today.  Quite frankly, it's a bit dry.  Also, I very much doubt it could garner a Caldecott in this day and age.  Its pictures never push any boundaries or even seem particularly unique.  Still, \\"Animals of the Bible\\" is a straightforward retelling of an old text.  For those of you looking for that kind of material for your children, knock yourself out.  Everyone else, seek amusement elsewhere.  It's a nice book but one that's outlived its usefulness (at least for children).e transcript to greet you.  These puppies are long and wordy.

482679:US	49148452	R3BHVOEP3TQ2F7	0689711816	646438686	From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler	Books	3	19	26	N	N	The Museum of Modern Aaaht	I suspect that if you missed reading \\"From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler\\" as a child you have, in a sense, missed the boat.  People who read this book as kids have a near psychotic attachment to it.  They'll buy you multiple copies and gleefully describe to you the delight they felt at the idea of running away and living in a museum of art.  The book's influence has stretched to the point where scenes from it have appeared in such popular films as \\"The Royal Tenenbaums\\".  Pity me, then, since the first time I read this book when I was roughly 20 years of age.  I read it, digested it, and came to the somewhat sour conclusion that it was a fine book but hardly worth the attention it's received.  Fast forward some six odd years.  I've just reread the book (again, as an adult).  I've a little more experience reading and reviewing children's literature, especially Newbery winners like this l'il number.  I read it.  I digested it.  And I came to the slightly less sour conclusion that while this book was enjoyable and loved widely by children everywhere, it's definitely not Konigsburg's best by a long shot.  \\"The View From Saturday\\" is her best.  \\"From the Mixed-Up Files\\" is just a nice gimmicky book that is vastly appealing to children but not written particularly well or badly.  It's fine, but that's all it is.  Fine.<br /><br />Claudia is deeply disappointed with her life.  Every day she goes about as the same old Claudia in the same old routine.  Convincing herself that the only recourse left to her is to run away from home, Claudia enlists the aid of her younger brother Jamie.  With Jamie in charge of all monetary concerns and Claudia heading the planning, the two set off on an adventure.  And where do all good suburban kids run away to when they live a short distance from New York City?  Why to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, of course!  While there the two live on their own, spending their money wisely.  It's not long before they find that their stay has coincided with the arrival of a mysterious statue that may or may not have been sculpted by Michelangelo.  Together, Claudia and Jamie set off to discover the secret of the statue.  A secret that may well live in the files of the mysterious Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler.<br /><br />Reading the book again, I have to admit I was a little more impressed with it than I expected to be.  Konigsburg certainly does cover her bases when it comes to plausible hiding out.  The kids think of everything possible when it comes to living on their own, including where to take baths and how to save their pennies.  You begin to really believe that a story of this nature could occur.  Unfortunately (and Konigsburg is, admittedly, guilty of this crime in more than one of her books) they don't really act their ages very well.  Jamie in particular seems blessed with a vocabulary well beyond his years.  This results in him saying phrases like, \\"Claudia, dear, I'm no angel.  Statue or otherwise\\".  I've yet to hear a nine year old of my own acquaintance casually use the word \\"otherwise\\" in conversation.<br /><br />The book's definitely a bit of a historical piece of work too.  The kids are constantly eating at automats (a place that most children will need some kind of explanation of).  The prices that they pay for things are almost ludicrously low and there are references to items of clothing like petticoats.  Otherwise, the book could have been written today.  Even as I write this I find that I'm growing a little fonder of it.  There have been far more recent children's books that have tried to latch onto the feelings inspired by \\"From the Mixed-Up Files\\".  I'm thinking, of course, of Blue Balliett's less successful (writing-wise), \\"Chasing Vermeer\\".  But nothing really compares with the original.  Though I'd be the first to say that \\"From the Mixed-Up Files\\" is not really the best book ever written, it's still a fun one for kids that's filled with excellent information on Michelangelo.

482747:US	49148452	R11N5EJOFME3WK	0064400824	951371469	A Stranger Came Ashore (Harper Trophy Book)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Ravens and selkies and skuddlers, oh my!	If you happen to be young, beautiful, blond, and female, your chances of being abducted by a dark underworld spirit are significantly higher than that of your fellows.  We're all familiar with the usual beautiful-girl-becomes-a-bride-below-the-ground tales told around the world.  Everything from the myth of Persephone to the ever popular \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" is based on this story.  Less popular, but no less interesting, is the beautiful-girl-becomes-a-bride-below-the-water school of storytelling.  \\"A Stranger Came Ashore\\" belongs squarely in the latter category.  In it, those dewey-eyed seals that look so doggone cute in nature documentaries turn out to hide far more sinister schemes behind their big brown eyes.<br /><br />To begin, a stranger comes ashore.  On a night of a dreadful shipwreak, a young man manages to drag himself into the happy home of young Robbie Henderson and his family.  The family rushes to the conclusion that the man is a survivor of the ship below and they immediately take him into their lives.  Once firmly ensconced in the home, the man (who goes by the name of Finn Learson - hint hint) does everything he can to win the family's trust and respect.  This may have something to do with Robbie's beautiful blond sister Elspeth, a girl that Finn seems to have a definite interest in.  When Robbie's dying grandfather informs him that there may be more to Finn than there seems and that Elspeth is in dire danger, Finn finds himself discovering the true nature that lurks behind Finn's gentle complexion.  With the aid of the town's schoolteacher/wizard Yarl Corbie, the two form a plan to bring Finn to justice, one way or another.<br /><br />Originally written in 1975, the book is just as lively and interesting today as it ever was.  The idea that selkies (seals that can turn into humans when they choose by shedding their seal skin) are malevolent beasts instead of gentle ones is a particularly interesting idea. Hunter has gently combined selkies with goblins, making them creatures to be avoided at all costs.  The book itself reads quickly and with a great deal of excitement.  Like the far more contemporary author Susan Cooper, Hunter has a real grasp on the Shetland Islands of northern Britain and their inhabitants.  The story in this book isn't particularly original in and of itself.  Plus, she pretty much says right from the start who Finn is, only filling in some of the more interesting details later on down the road.  I was also a little disappointed that there wasn't much in the way of character development going on here.  Robbie becomes obsessed with the notion that Elspeth, at any moment, might find herself spirited away by a lustful suitor.  But we never hear enough about Elspeth or her personality to wonder if this might really be a bad thing.  Was she particularly close to Robbie?  Was she a great person that it would be a shame to lose?  Or is it just a case of Elspeth being community property that strangers have no right to take?<br /><br />In many ways, \\"A Stranger Came Ashore\\" is a cautionary tale.  Don't go around trusting fellows with funny accents who you take into your home out of the goodness of your heart.  They'll stab you in the back they will!  Such stories exist all over the world and they're ever-so-slightly-xenophobic for this reason.  I'm not accusing this book of perpetuating hatred, or anything complicated like that.  I'm just saying that this is obviously the moral lesson we're supposed to draw from it.  Otherwise, it's a perfectly good fantasy tale for any kid interested in fairies, selkies, or just mysterious goings-ons in old Britain itself.  The book's a good read and one that advertises itself as, \\"A Story of Suspense\\".  I think that's a fairly accurate statement.  If you find yourself getting invested in the story (which will take a little longer than you might hope) you'll enjoy its gripping storyline and threatening villain.

Recently I had the chance to review a delightful picture book entitled, \\"Jamela's Dress\\" by South African author/illustrator Niki Daly.  That done I moved on to read and review some other picture books on my list.  I found a fabulous and relatively new retelling of an old story by Barry Downard entitled, \\"The Little Red Hen\\" and settled in to read it.  To my surprise, Mr. Downard is ALSO a resident of South Africa.  Now I've been reviewing picture books for a very long time (which is to say, roughly one year) and I never ran across any South African creators in my travels... ever.  Suddenly within a single week I read not one but two, practically in a row.  It seems to me that perhaps we are seeing a definite increase in South African picture book popularity.  I, for one, am not opposed to the notion.<br /><br />But to get back to the book.  \\"The Little Red Hen\\" contains perhaps one of the most straightforward, shan't deviate from the text, retellings of the originally story I've ever perused.  I'm sure you know the tale, but if not I'll sum it up for you.  Once there was a little red hen who lived with three lousy no-goodnik animals.  When the little red hen discovers some grains of wheat (where she finds them is left somewhat unclear) she asks the duck, the pig, and the cat if they want to help her plant it.  They decline.  When it's time to harvest she makes a similar request and they, once more, decline.  This continues as she takes the wheat to the mill then bakes it into delicious mouth-watering bread.  When the hen makes a final offer of \\"Who will help me eat the bread\\", the other animals are suddenly very interested in being useful.  However, the little red hen was just asking so that she could throw it in their faces that since they never helped her, their share would be zippo.  So she eats it all up herself, to their chagrin.<br /><br />Anyone who reads through this story and doesn't flash back to Jon Scieszka's version of it in \\"The Stinky Cheese Man\\" is made of stronger stuff than I.  However, Barry Downard's retelling will definitely keep you from thinking of anything BUT his own particularly unique method of illustration.  You see, Barry's one of those newfangled computer graphic illustrators living in the world today.  In what the bookflap describes as \\"photo collage\\", Barry has taken pictures of real hens, cats, pigs, and ducks and given them particularly anthropomorphic tendencies.  The hen herself sports a pair of round bright blue glasses, looking like nothing so much as small feathered version of Janet Reno.  The pig, a loathsome tusky fellow, wears a backwards baseball cap whose entire logo is enragingly impossible to read.  The cat and duck don't have any especially interesting tendencies.  They just lounge and lay back.  As the hen bustles about, the others engage in everything from checkers and sunbathing to playing poker and pool.  Perhaps most baffling for me was an odd picture in which everyone sits around watching \\"Hairy Trotter\\" starring a Harry Potteresque pig in round glasses.  It's doggone weird.<br /><br />The photographs themselves stick with you though.  Barry obviously put some work and thought into their creation.  When the hen rides a bike to the mill she sports a tiny black bike helmet and manages to peddle the contraption through a complicated invention involving sticks on hinges and red rubber boots.  Perspective and focus change and shift according to the needs of the pictures.  All in all, the efforts made in this book are impressive.  They're colorful and, with the possible exception of the last too close close-up, believably done.<br /><br />This book sticks with you long after you've read it.  I've little doubt in my mind that kids reading it will love it desperately.  After all, what more could they want than to see real animals doing the kinds of things little kids do all the time?  Mainly, goofing off.  I don't know how many children will actually be sympathetic to the little red hen herself.  She comes off as a kind of humorless know-it-all (hence my \\"Stinky Cheese Man\\" comment), but the pictures more than make up for her.  If you're looking for a picture book that does something absolutely new, intriguing, and inventive, \\"The Little Red Hen\\" has your number.

Author's Notes.  As you read through the various picture books available to the public today, you forget how important Author's Notes are sometimes.  You take them for granted until one day, out of the blue, you read a fabulous picture book like, \\"ellington was not a street\\", and find yourself scrambling frantically for something ANYTHING that reveals who the author is and what her intent was.  After some readings and re-readings, I finally discovered a little background to this story hidden away in the hardback copy's bookflap.  I'll share this information with you since, aside from its apparent destestation of clarification, \\"ellington was not a street\\" is a beautiful work of picture book art that deserves to be culled through by kids and scolars alike for years to come.<br /><br />Poet and author Ntozake Shange drew up in the company of some of the greatest black heroes of America.  Can you imagine what it must be like to know that as a toddler you slept on the couch while Paul Robeson and W.E.B. Dubois discussed the world?  Or to remember the presence of people like Dizzy Gillespie and the Clovers in your home?  With \\"ellington was not a street\\" you can.  In Kadir Nelson's sumptuous images the viewer accompanies a small girl in a beautiful blue dress.  The girl, supposedly Shange herself when young, inserts herself into almost each and every picture in this book.  One moment she's greeting Ray Barretto at the door and in another she's pleased as punch to be attending a fancy soiree her parents are hosting.  The book's text is a poem originally written by Shange in 1983.  Entitled, \\"Mood Indigo\\", it starts off with a simple, \\"it hasnt always been this way/ ellington was not a street\\".  A modern day Ellington Street stares us in the face and from it we're drawn back in time to an era when the great men of the Harlem Rennaisance mingled with a younger up-and-coming generation.  As the book concludes with a final, \\"it hasn't always been this way...\\", we look into the kind and smiling face of the man of the title himself.  A single baton rests between his hands.<br /><br />The poem is, of course, excellent.  It simply states that you cannot assume that the world we live in today was always as it was.  It was forged by the likes of Nkrumah and Virgil Akins.  It was created with the aid of strong men and women.  So yes, bravo poem.  But I don't mind saying that I think the real genius here is Kadir Nelson.  Nelson has a artistic grasp of perspective and angle that just kills you.  The two parts of the book that look at modern Ellington Street show, in two sections, the same woman attempting to cross its street.  The figure of the small girl watching the men and women around her is a perfect way to keep kids interested in the story.  They identify with the girl.  She's so adorable and knowing, all at once, that it would be difficult for the adults reading this book not to identify with her as well.  The famous figures in this story are represented beautifully, their features perfectly attenuated according to the situation.  There is no doubt in my mind that every single face in this book (and there are, literally, a ton) is based on a real person.  Most impressive is the final shot where everyone who has appeared in the book poses together for the viewer.  The picture looks like a living breathing photograph of the greats.  Whether people are smiling demurely or mugging shamelessly, it's a heckuva fabulous image.<br /><br />For those readers who need to brush up on their Nkrumah or Sonny Til history, a helpful biographical section appears at the back of the book with pictures of the featured men.  This was incredibly helpful to me, though I'm proud to say that I knew the history of at least four of the nine displayed.  Still, where's the Author's Note that explains why the author's father was so popular with these famous fellows?  Why is there an image of Shange, older, clutching an Ellington record at the beginning of the book?  What were these people talking about?  The book is so good, but it leaves so much left unsaid.  It's the same objection I had with Tony Kushner's fabulous, \\"Brundibar\\", as well.  The book assumes its readers don't need additional information.  The book is wrong.  Just the same, don't pass it by.  Grab this puppy and give your children a good reading.  They may not get it at first, but this is one of those picture books that kids will appreciate for its beauty and resonance.  It's a lovely display of some true American heroes.cord at the beginning of the book?  What were these people talking about?  The book is so good, but it leaves so much left unsaid.

Yet one of the countries I've never really read a picture book from is beautiful South Africa.  Here we have a country steeped in color and beauty and yet the schoolchildren of America know relatively little about it.  Heck, I'll go so far as to say that MOST U.S. schoolchildren probably couldn't even find it on a map.  Fortunately, that's all changed with the presence of author/illustrator Niki Daly and his heroine Jamela.  If you've met Jamela in the past, you know what to expect from her.  If you've never met her before, you're in for a real treat.<br /><br />Jamela and her mother, residents of South Africa, are out shopping for dress fabric on fine and frolicksome day.  After locating a beautiful but costly skein of orange/yellow weave, the two buy it up and wash the stiffness out of it.  As the fabric dries on the line, Jamela's mama tells her daughter, in no uncertain terms, to keep the dog off of it.  She doesn't want anything messing it up.  Technically, Jamela obeys her mother's orders.  The dog never gets the fabric dirty.  Jamela, on the other hand, takes it on a joyous walk down the street, drawing the attention of many friends and neighbors.  Too soon, however, Jamela must face the consequences of her actions and her mama is left unconsolable.  It's only through an odd quirk of fate that Jamela is inadvertently responsible for her mother's new dress and a little surprise of her own.<br /><br />Niki Daly must have kids.  I've never said that about a single picture book illustrator before, but I think I have to say it now.  There's something in Jamela's face that is dead on.  When she wraps herself in the lovely remains of the fabric as her acquaintance Archie takes her picture, her face is a glowing combination of smugness and preschool pride.  In fact, Daly has also captured the movements of his characters beautifully in this story.  From Jamela's traipse along the dusty dirty street to the rambunctious clamering of friends and neighbors, Daly has an eye for natural human relations.  There are delightful tiny details to observe as well.  Note that when Jamela takes her walk she has obviously outfitted herself as well in her mama's too large red sandals.<br /><br />And then there are the colors and fabrics in this story.  The only picture book I've read that rivals this one in delightful material selection would have to be Lloyd Alexander's, \\"The Fortune Teller\\".  Together, these two books would make one heckuva good storytime session.  In this book, every person in this book wears realistic and fitting clothing.  Archie sports a remarkable matching print suit while Jamela eventual comes to wear an elephant infused jumper.  And Daly's so adept that you can sometimes make out the shifting colors and shades that make up each one of Jamela's dredlocks.<br /><br />In an Author's Note at the end, Niki Daly gives some additional information about the history of the term \\"Kwela\\" (a word that pops up more than once in this book) giving the reader a little more information about South Africa itself.  It fits the book well.  I'd often heard wonderful things about the Jamela book series, but I'd never had the pleasure of actually reading one before.  Now that I have, I'm happy to have found it.

And Daly's so adept that you can sometimes make out the shifting colors and shades that make up each one of Jamela's dredlocks.   <br />  <br />In an Author's Note at the end, Niki Daly gives some additional information about the history of the term \\"Kwela\\" (a word that pops up more than once in this book) giving the reader a little more information about South Africa itself.  It fits the book well.  I'd often heard wonderful things about the Jamela book series, but I'd never had the pleasure of actually reading one before.  Now that I have, I'm happy to have found it.  It's a vibrant and entirely pleasing concoction. <br />	2004-10-20

In my experience as a children's librarian, when a kid comes up to me looking for information about the navy (and trust me, it happens) I usually end up throwing them headlong into the appropriate section of non-fiction books with the hope that follow-up questions will not be forthcoming.  Needless to say, I don't know much about the navy.  Fortunately, I've just read a navy-rific book that I may definitely recommend to little navy lovers everywhere (and, interestingly enough, navy haters too).  \\"Left For Dead\\", has everything a good non-fiction story should.  Action, adventure, shark infested waters, and a young optimistic hero who wins in the end.  Though certain elements of this book rankled me at the most inappropriate of times, I have enough sense to see that in spite of its flaws, \\"Left For Dead\\", is an excellent encapsulation of how sometimes one boy can change history itself.<br /><br />If you're like the hero of this story, eleven-year-old Hunter Scott, then you probably learned about the sinking of the USS Indianapolis as he did through the movie \\"Jaws\\".  Remember that scene where Robert Shaw's talking with Richard Dreyfuss and Roy Scheider about how he once served on that ship?  Remember how he describes the sharks eating the men after their ship sank and that it took some five days to be rescued?  Well after seeing that scene Hunter knew he'd found the perfect history fair project.  Trouble was, the history books seemed to have obscured knowledge of the Indianapolis and its unlucky crew.  So Hunter set about contacting the survivors and talking to them.  As he did, one thing became incredibly clear to him.  Many of the survivors were convinced that their captain, one Mr. Charles Butler McVay III, was wrongfully court-martialed for the sinking of the ship.  Suddenly Hunter's involved in a quest that will take him to the halls of Washington, the sets of television shows, and into the public eye in general.  He becomes the Indianpolis crews' last hope to restore dignity to the man they all respected.  The only question is, can one kid really take on the Navy and make them apologize?<br /><br />Author Pete Nelson is at his best when he's recounting the days of the Indianapolis and the events that led to its sinking.  These passages are gripping and tight with tension.  He opens with a man's experiences as he escapes the sinking vessel and has to contend with oil-filled seas, a fellow sailor who cannot swim, and most horrific of all, sharks.  Then he flashes forward to Hunter interviewing the former crewmembers.  Then it's back to the past, with insights into many different survivors' personal stories.  Nelson looses some of this wonderful writing excitement when he tells Hunter's contemporary quest, but the book's still interesting.  Hopefully the teens reading it won't mind long court sequences and Senatorial rigamarole.  Nelson also has an odd tendancy to dissolve into funny descriptive sentences.  For example, note the sentence, \\"...injustice is like the shadow cast by wrong - shine enough light on a shadow and it goes away\\".  Or, more bizarrely, his comparison of moving a bill through Congress to Myst or Dungeons and Dragons.  And the author is a fan of getting a little too wrapped up in the story he's trying to tell.  Personally (and this is probably just my problem, so don't assume you'll object to this) I found the politics in this book grating.  Yes, I'm happy that Senator Joe Scarborough moved Hunter's history project to his Pensacola office (thereby lending it much needed publicity).  But I feel a deep moral repugnance towards Joe Scarborough so mentions of him, Newt Gingrich, and other politicians, with whom I have what can only be politely described as an abhorrence, hurt to read.  Fortunately, Nelson doesn't linger on them (though the fact that Hunter describes himself in the book's preface as the president of his school's Young Republicans club gave me pause right from the get-go).<br /><br />Still, Nelson has his fair share of wherewithal and canniness.  He gives equal honor and appreciation to the tale told by Mochitsura Hashimoto (the man who sank the Indianapolis in the first place) as he does the Indianapolis's crew.  And to me, his respect of Hashimoto is the ultimate display of the absurdity of war.  Here we have good men that, in the course of WWII, killed one another.  Nelson's strength lies in his equal respect of both sides during the conflict and his acknowledgement that both the Japanese and the American committed atrocities.  Finally, the book simultaneously supports the Navy and condemns it for its intractability years after it made a mistake of count-martialing McVay.  It's a delicate juggling act that Nelson passes off without too many lost balls.<br /><br />Most non-fiction retellings of tragic or inspiring events try to simply display the facts of a matter without too much meddling.  If you decide to read \\"Left For Dead\\", (85% is thrilling reading too), be prepared for a lot of Christian references and a distinct mindset of its own.  Also be prepared for a truly heartwarming story about a boy and the men he set out to fight for.  The book's a little didactic a little too often, but it tells a tale that desperately needed to be heard.  With ample pictures, a wonderful bibliography, an index, and more facts than you can swing a hammer at, this book is factual and written well.  You may not agree with everything it says, but you'll have a hard time not respecting its story and the heroes in it.>Still, Nelson has his fair share of wherewithal and canniness.

With few exceptions, her books feature children wise beyond their years.  Whether you're skimming the self-aware musings of Claudia in, \\"From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler\\" or chancing across the adventures of the kids of, \\"A View From Saturday\\", Konigsburg excels at creating kids that embody  the statement, Know Thyself.  And the best example of this, without question, is her 1979 collection of five short stories entitled, \\"Throwing Shadows\\".  The bookflap for this work says of the characters that, \\"In each of these lives something happens that allows the hero to throw a shadow that is his very own, one that is sharp and has a shape as specific as a fingerprint\\".  At its worst, this book seems like a series of writing assignments penned by the author.  At its best, it tells unique tales about learning to be honest with one's self.<br /><br />Ned, Avery, Ampara, Phillip, and William each have a separate story to tell.  For Ned, his life's work consists of finding and collecting fossilized shark teeth off the coast of northern Florida.  When an oblivious tourist attaches himself to Ned with high hopes of shark tooth glory, Ned has to decide exactly how he should treat this unwanted, but pitiable, tagalong.  Avery doesn't have it any easier.  It's taken him some years to figure it out, but by the time he reaches sixth grade Avery has separated the world into catchers and catchee.  You're either the kind of person who catches others, or you get caught.  Avery is in the latter category.  It's only through the insightful musings of his older brother, though, that he knows what to do with that information.  Ampara is a little different from the other people in this book since she is not a child.  She knows one though.  A guide to the rural villages of Ecuador, Ampara meets and befriends Antonio.  A boy with grand ambitions for becoming a man, he comes to realize through Ampara that trust is something adults must come to appreciate if they wish to be respected themselves.  Phillip tells the viewer right from the start that he's not a spaz, a fact that may strain a the reader's credulity.  After accompanying his mother to the nursing home where she works, he begins to slowly record the stories of the residents there.  When the project gets out of hand, Phillip finds a way to make even some of the home's more prejudiced members open their minds a little.  Finally, in William's story we are sucked fully into the world of antique dealers.  As his mother becomes fascinated with learning more about critiquing pieces of furniture she learns to become more self-reliant, even at the expense of being right when others are wrong.<br /><br />The stories are connected by the idea that human beings, regardless of age, are capable of learning more and being more than the world would sometimes have them.  When it comes to themes such as this, Konigsburg is at her best.  Each story's moral is clear and defined.  It's the details that sometimes ring false for me.  To my mind, I don't personally mind Konigsburg's typically precocious kid characters.  As long as they don't become TOO worldly wise in the course of their adventures (paging \\"The View From Saturday\\") they're tolerable.  But in this particular collection of tales, Konigsburg sometimes exchanges telling her stories clearly for telling her stories cleverly.  The results are not always pleasing.  As much as I might appreciate her style, it has a  nasty tendency of obscuring the text.  For example, in Avery's story we're constantly hearing about his run ins with the law (which is almost never his fault).  A reader might wonder why Avery is constantly being given a hard time by people in authority.  It's only when you get 75% through the story that you learn that Avery is black.  A fact that would have been nice to know at, oh say, the story's beginning.  Konigsburg's stories are riddled with little quirks and missteps such as this.  They don't make for poor reading.  Just readings that are slightly askew.<br /><br />If anything, \\"Throwing Shadows\\" is an excellent book to look at in terms of understanding how Konigsburg's style has changed over the years.  The stories told here are certainly accomplished, but they lack the polished voice of her later works.  I certainly think that in spite of its 1979 publication date the book still has things to say to kids today.  And it is certainly more sophisticated that some of her younger works.  Still, in many ways this is a book produced by an author still trying to find her voice.  Worth a look-see at the very least.led with little quirks and missteps such as this.

You're tempted to just go out and purchase that fabulous Sid Meier video game, \\"Civilization\\", but you suspect that a) You'd just be doing it for yourself and b) That's not the best way to teach five-year-olds.  Voila!  Author Paul Fleischman (or shall I say, NEWBERY award winning author Paul Fleischman) and artist Kevin Hawkes (sorry Kevin... no Newberys for you) have joined together to bring us a history of the founding of Weslandia in its book of the same name.  The only picture book I've ever seen where kids that create their own fantasy worlds pale in the face of kids that put those worlds into practice.<br /><br />Wesley isn't like other boys, a fact that drives his parents mad.  He's an inventor who regularly refuses to join the crowd and fit in.  With school over for the summer, Wesley sets about coming up with a project for the warm months.  Thanks to his sarcastic father's throwaway remark about burgeoning civilizations, \\"I'm sure you'll use that knowledge often\\", the boy constructs a brilliant scheme.  With the help of traveling seeds, Wesley will create and maintain his own unique civlization.  New plants begin to grow and thrive in our hero's backyard (plants that would have been plucked as weeds if the nosy neighbor had his way).  In time, the plants have flowered and produced fruit.  With these as his base, Wesley refines his new food source.  He tends his crops and, with their soft inner fibers, weaves new clothes for himself.  He creates a sundial that uses the number of petals on the plant's flowers and creates games made from the many parts of the plants.  You get the idea.  By the end of the summer, Wesley has learned that not only can a person make themselves happy through invention, they can also win themselves some followers.<br /><br />The book's deeply inventive premise gives the book that rare honor of being fascinating to both children and adults.  Kids will love the premise of a child as founder of a new lifestyle.  Parents will be impressed by the clever ways in which author Fleischman has displayed how civilizations throughout the world began.  Flischman's world is utterly believable.  After putting down the book, you have a hard time not coming to the conclusion that Weslandia could easily exist with relatively few changes.  As is often the case with brilliant picture books, however, \\"Weslandia\\" would only be half as good as it is without the stylings of artist Kevin Hawkes.  Hawkes has carefully included Wesley's eighty letter alphabet on the endpapers of this book.  He's created Wesley's original game (a kind of Quidditch on stilts).  He's even endowed his somewhat Harry Potterish hero with beautiful birds, colors, and flowers.  The pictures here are sometimes realistic, sometimes silly, but always impressive.  Tiny delightful details spot this book, and by its end kids will have a hard time leaving beloved Weslandia.  They may even go so far as to create their own version of it.<br /><br />If you've read any of Paul Fleischman's other books (such as \\"Seek\\" or \\"Joyful Noise: Poems For Two Voices\\") then you already know about his originality as a writer.  For those of you who haven't encountered his works before, \\"Weslandia\\" will come to you as a delightful surprise.  For a good storytime pairing, consider reading it with Jerdine Nolan's, \\"Harvey Potter's Balloon Farm\\".  It's one of those picture book treasures you'll be amazed and delighted to discover.ts.

Using repetitive lines and pictures that, to my mind, are the finest Anita Lobel illustrations existing to date, the book is a perfect accompaniment to any leisurely summer storytime.<br /><br />Our very first image is of a beautiful red rose in the corner of a page.  Says the text, \\"This is the rose in my garden\\".  Next we see a bee that sleeps in the rose in the garden.  Then we view the hollyhocks that give shade to the bee that sleeps on the rose in the garden.  From there we are privy to marigolds that stand by the hollyhocks that shade the bee asleep on the rose in the garden.  And so on.  A variety of different flowers appear and for a second it looks as if this book is no more than a mildly interesting catalogue of flora and fauna.  That is, until we meet a small mouse, \\"quaking in fear\\".  Before you know it a cat has burst through the flowers, wreaking such havoc as pushing the peonies and startling the lilies.  All looks lost for the mouse... until the cat wakes the bee asleep in the rose.  The final two page image includes a black and white penned shot of an unhappy cat with a bandage on its nose and a parting shot of, once more, the rose in the garden.<br /><br />The book has a kind of lazy languid attitude to it that works beautifully with the illustrations.  Methinks this would read best to those kids that are already in a sleepy state of mind.  Aside from the raucous appearance of the cat and mouse chase sequence, very little occurs in this story.  Parents who don't know the difference between a peony and a zinnia may take more out of this story than their kids.  On the other hand, it's just gosh darn lovely to look at.  Ms. Lobel usually draws in an odd cartoony style (ala her somewhat bizarre, \\"A Treeful of Pigs\\"), but the only slightly silly shots in this book are of the cat and mouse.  Kids who identify with the cat won't appreciate the bee's sudden sting to its nose, but it's not exactly harrowing.  They'll deal.<br /><br />Of the Anita and Arnold Lobel collaborations out there, this one is probably the quietest.  I've a special place in my heart for their remarkable, \\"On Market Street\\" (their best work) but this book is also worth taking a gander too.  Consider it recommended for those children that are patient enough to wade through long descriptive passages to get to the excitement at the book's end.the only slightly silly shots in this book are of the cat and mouse.

Too often a child figure will suddenly find his or herself in the presence of (oh say) Abraham Lincoln and will teach the great man about following his childlike instincts or some other such goo.  This is not to say that historical figures and situations are at odds with children's literature.  I just want to make it clear that it's rare to find a really clever and believable situation in which the real and the unreal mix.  \\"A Northern Light\\" is one such rarity.<br /><br />In this book, heroine Mattie Gorkey lives two different narratives.  In one story, she's working at a fancy hotel in the Northern Woods in 1906.  A young woman vacationing at the hotel was recently discovered drowned in a nearby lake.  Weighing on Mattie's conscience is the fact that just the day before the girl had entrusted her letters to our heroine with strict instructions that they be burned.  Mattie has not burned them yet.  The second narrative takes place several months before the exciting events at the hotel.  Here we learn far more about Mattie's background and her love of literature and writing.  With a mother recently dead and a family of five to care for, Mattie's great dream is to attend Barnard College in New York.  Unfortunately, her pa is anything but receptive to the idea and there's a cute boy hanging around who seems to be giving Mattie quite a bit of attention.  Focusing on her own dilemmas with the caring but somewhat close minded society in which she lives, Mat must figure out who she is and what is most important to her in the end.  Mixing fiction with the historical events surrounding the 1906 Grace Brown murder case, the book effortlessly combines the two stories without so much as a hitch.<br /><br />Author Jennifer Donnelly has given herself a surprisingly difficult task.  How do you write a historical figure, particularly a female, and make her independent without making her seem like a 21st century girl in an early 20th century world?  How, in other words, do you make her believable?  Make no mistake, Mattie is a very believable character.  So believable, in fact, that I found myself wanting to throttle her from time to time.  I mean, she's a teenager, so we have to make allowances for her behavior.  If she goes all doe-eyed over the local brick-headed swain, that's only partly her fault.  Just the same, I suspect readers everywhere will be sometimes screaming in their heads at this character when she tries to decide what to do with Grace's letters or her own life.  As for the melding of Mattie's story with that of Grace Brown's, it's seamless.  Almost as if the events told here are the hard boiled truth.  Still, it's a pity that the details of Grace's life don't parallel perfectly with Mattie's.  The final decision made at the book's end would make a little more sense had Grace been similar to Mattie in personality or living situation.  As it is, it's not entirely clear where Mat draws her final conclusions about living and life from.  But these are small potatoes.  There is no doubt left in the reader's mind at the end that the book is effortlessly written.<br /><br />Fans of Elizabeth Taylor's great film, \\"A Place In the Sun\\", will see definite similarities between the murder in this book and that movie.  That's because both works were based on an actual trial that inspired such works as Theodore Dreiser's, \\"An American Tragedy\\".  But this isn't just a younger version of an already existing tale.  \\"A Northern Light\\" stands on its own as a remarkable and well-told tale of one girl and her search for (for lack of a better word) fulfillment.  It's a gripping story as you read through, not certain in the least that Mattie will do the right thing at the right moment.  Bound to raise a fair amount of discussion and debate.

490516:US	49148452	R6KG972DYQSW0	0395181569	902144535	The Little House (Sandpiper Books)	Books	4	60	67	N	N	Urban sprawl - the picture book	The year is 1942 and America has fallen head over heels in love with a whole new literary form.  It's sweeping the nation!  It's appearing hither and yon!  Yes, in the early 1940s, picture books were suddenly awash in inanimate objects with human characteristics.  Whether it was \\"The Little Red Lighthouse and the Great Grey Bridge\\", or the Caldecott winning, \\"The Little House\\", children were reading about a variety of living breathing pieces of architecture.  Virginia Lee Burton was especially good at this kind of book.  Her previous venture, \\"Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel\\", was a smash hit (remaining so today).  So Burton decided to up the stakes a little and write a similar story about a little house.  In this book, however, Burton outdoes herself by being able to convey seasons, the passage of time, and the nasty ways cities have of encroaching on country landscapes all within a scant 40 pages.<br /><br />Long ago a little house was built in the country.  The man who built her decided that this house, special as it was, could never be bought and sold.  Instead, he planned on leaving it to his children, his children's children, and his children's children's children.  Etc.  The house was pleased with the arrangement.  It watched the seasons go by.  It watched the children that played in it grow up and move away.  It even watched the changing fashions and modes of transportation.  Horse and buggies one day, automobiles the next.  This is all well and good until a new asphalt road appears.  Suddenly it's a heckuva lot easier for people to reach the area in which the little house lives.  Things get faster and suddenly the little house is surrounded by tenement houses.  Then there are trolley cars (oh the trolley cars).  Next comes elevated trains, and subways, and (worst of all) gigantic skyscrapers on either side of the now seriously dilapidated little house.  One day, a descendent of the original owner sees the house and inquires after it.  Since it turns out she owns it (I guess... the book's a little shaky on the legal aspects of ownership at this point) the house is summarily picked up by movers and taken to the country she loves so much.  Happy house.  Happy family.  The end.<br /><br />I wonder what the percentage is of children reading this book and realizing that, in time, the city will probably come to surround the little house yet again.  There has probably never been a better book that delineates so clearly the horrors of urban sprawl.  On a less hoity-toity level, this is just a darn good book.  Burton's illustrations are simple little paintings with tiny human figures.  Due to the fact that there are nineteen pictures of the little house that are basically looking at it straight on without any change in perspective or angle, it's mind-boggling that Burton has still managed to make every single illustration unique and interesting.  Whether she's filled the page with autumnal colors, or is driving home the horror of the little house's fate through stark black and white images, these pictures are incredibly well done.  Kids reading the book will enjoy the different vehicles and tiny human figures that dot each page.  Adults will enjoy the craft Burton has taken with her storytelling.<br /><br />There are a lot of Caldecott award winning books that have aged oh-so badly.  \\"Animals of the Bible\\" comes to mind as does the gawdawful \\"Abraham Lincoln\\" by the Parin d'Aulaires.  This book, however, is well worthy of its praise.  It may not be a flashy irony-soaked post-modern picture book like the ones being written today (and admittedly, I love a good irony-soaked picture book as much as the next gal) but it holds its ground and deserves to be remembered.  Give it half a chance and you'll wind up loving it.out she owns it (I guess... the book's a little shaky on the legal aspects of ownership at this point) the house is summarily picked up by movers and taken to the country she loves so much.

The end. <br />  <br />I wonder what the percentage is of children reading this book and realizing that, in time, the city will probably come to surround the little house yet again.  There has probably never been a better book that delineates so clearly the horrors of urban sprawl.  On a less hoity-toity level, this is just a darn good book.  Burton's illustrations are simple little paintings with tiny human figures.  Due to the fact that there are nineteen pictures of the little house that are basically looking at it straight on without any change in perspective or angle, it's mind-boggling that Burton has still managed to make every single illustration unique and interesting.  Whether she's filled the page with autumnal colors, or is driving home the horror of the little house's fate through stark black and white images, these pictures are incredibly well done.  Kids reading the book will enjoy the different vehicles and tiny human figures that dot each page.  Adults will enjoy the craft Burton has taken with her storytelling. <br />  <br />There are a lot of Caldecott award winning books that have aged oh-so badly.  \\"Animals of the Bible\\" comes to mind as does the gawdawful \\"Abraham Lincoln\\" by the Parin d'Aulaires.  This book, however, is well worthy of its praise.  It may not be a flashy irony-soaked post-modern picture book like the ones being written today (and admittedly, I love a good irony-soaked picture book as much as the next gal) but it holds its ground and deserves to be remembered.  Give it half a chance and you'll wind up loving it. <br />	2004-10-14

I should preface this book with a personal explanation.  The best way to approach Sherman Alexie is to look into your own personal history regarding American Indians.  For me, I grew up with the vague notion that Indians didn't exist anymore.  I think a lot of kids that don't live near large Native American populations suffer from this perception.  I mean, where in popular culture do you ever come across a modern day Indian?  There was that movie \\"Smoke Signals\\" (based on one of the stories in this book) and possibly the television show \\"Northern Exposure\\" but that is it, ladies and gentlemen.  In my own life, realization hit when I started Junior High and read \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" for the very first time.  If you've read the book then you know that it dwells on the character \\"Chief\\" and his past.  I read about him and found out that I knew diddly over squat about Native Americans.  They show \\"Dances With Wolves\\" in high school homeroom and through that you're supposed to infer contemporary Indian culture?  That's like watching \\"Gone With the Wind\\" and wondering where all the happy slaves are today.  It doesn't make sense.  This is why I'm nominating, \\"The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight In Heaven\\" as the book that should be required in every Junior High and High School in the country immediately.  We've all read our \\"Catcher In the Rye\\" and \\"Scarlet Letter\\".  Now let's read something real.<br /><br />The book is a collection of short stories, all containing repeating characters and events.  There is no single plot to the story and while the character of Victor is probably the closest thing the book has to a protagonist, he hardly hogs the spotlight for very long.  In this book we witness a single Spokane Reservation.  We watch personal triumphs and repeated failures and mistakes.  Author Alexie draws on history, tradition, and contemporary realism to convey the current state of the American Indian.  You'll learn more than you thought to.<br /><br />My favorite chapter in this book, bar none, is \\"A Good Story\\".  In it, a character's mother mentions that her son's stories are always kind of depressing.  By this point the reader is more than halfway through the book and has probably thought the same thing (deny it though they might).  In response, Junior tells a story that isn't depressing.  Just thoughtful and interesting.  It's as if Alexie himself has conceded briefly that, no, the stories in this book aren't of the cheery happy-go-lucky nature the reader might be looking for.  That's probably because the stories are desperately real and fantastical all at once.  To be honest, I feel a bit inadequate reviewing this book.  It's obvious that Alexie is probably the greatest writer of his generation.  Hence, these stories are infinitely readable and distressing.<br /><br />This is a good book.  This is the book to read when you ask yourself, \\"What author haven't I ever read before?\\".  This is the book you will find yourself poring over on subways, buses, and taxi cabs.  You'll leave it on park benches and run twenty blocks north to retrieve it again.  I don't know how many other ways I can say that it's a good book.  Well worth reading.  Funny and taxing all at once.  Sherman Alexie deserves greater praise than any I can give him.  All I can say then is that this book is beautiful.  Read this book./>My favorite chapter in this book, bar none, is \\"A Good Story\\".  In it, a character's mother mentions that her son's stories are always kind of depressing.

From Edward Bloor's well-intentioned, \\"Storytime\\" to \\"The Report Card\\" by the otherwise talented Andrew Clements, these books have attempted to capture the dangers of this destructive teaching tool.  Both books have fallen short, leaving some people to wonder if there could ever be a book that discusses this sometimes controversial subject well.  What few people know is that there's a fantastic well-written and beautifully put together fantasy series that begins with the horrific results of what happens when a society bases all decisions on testing.  Regular methodical testing.  In William Nicholson's, \\"The Wind Singer\\", (the first in his \\"Wind On Fire\\" trilogy), the term \\"distopia\\" takes on a whole new look and meaning.  In a book that is simultaneously wise, beautifully penned, and deeply moving, \\"The Wind Singer\\", gets to the bottom of rigid test-based communities and show us a beautiful worst-case scenario.<br /><br />Aramanth is a community that loves its tests.  Living by the daily pledge, \\"I vow to strive harder, to reach higher, and in every way to seek to make tomorrow better than today\\", its citizens embody the ultimate caste system.  Based on strict standardized testing, people live according to how well they test.  The nicest homes belong to those members of society that answer quizzes effectively and intelligently.  For those people who don't like tests or don't do well on them for a variety of reasons, they live on the bottom rungs of society.  There's very little rebellion in Aramanth due to its rigid control of any possible insubordination on the part of its citizens.  That is, until one day little Kestrel Hath decides that she doesn't want to live in a world based on testing anymore.  Suddenly she's endangered her family and herself.  There seems no escape from Aramanth's rules and regulations, until the ancient Emperor, a disused ruler, tells Kestral about the Wind Singer.  This gigantic and ancient construction of pipes that towers over the town was once given the ability to sing to its citizens, calming their hearts and making them happy.  When the key to the Wind Singer's voice was stolen, the society became cold and hardened into its current state.  With her twin brother Bowman and their initially unwanted tagalong Mumpo at her side, Kestral and company embark on a quest to save Aramanth from itself once and for all.<br /><br />I nominate this book for the title, Perfect Distopian Novel.  I've not fallen for a fabulous fantasy in a long time, and this book has everything you could want in it.  A great (and little used) moral.  Characters you care about deeply.  A gripping plot.  Everything.  I greatly appreciated that the parents of the heroes in this book were not only both alive (name three children's books, especially fantasies, where that's the case) but also active, amusing, and subversive aids to their kids' efforts.  Too often parents fret and flail in children's novels, adding nothing to the story but woe.  In this book, however, Mr. and Mrs. Hath recognize the quest their children are on and decide to raise a little hooplah in Aramanth on their own.  The results are quite fabulous.  I was also impressed by the character of Mumpo.  A developmentally challenged boy who loves the Hath twins desperately, Mumpo could easily have been a kind of mock-Forest Gump character, spouting simple platitudes and giving everyone around him a patented new lookout on life.  Ugh.  There's a little of that, but Nicholson is clever enough to know how to give Mumpo more complexity than Mr. Gump.  His character learns and grows (sometimes frighteningly) through his experiences and his very existence makes the twins kinder people through his presence.<br /><br />There are an awful lot of other things good in this story, though.  For one thing, I think it contains the scariest evil army I've ever read.  You can keep your \\"Lordof the Rings\\"-type orcs and goblins.  I personally believe that the army of the Zars, a relentlessly cheery troop of endless, young, white-suited, peppy people given to singing \\"Kill Kill Kill\\" at the top of their voices, is the most horrifying group to ever appear in a children's book.  The Zars are rivaled in evil, however, by a prematurely old group of children with the ability to suck the youth out of anyone they touch.  Worst of all is the evil spirit-lord, the Morah.  The Morah has long since convinced the citizens of Aramanth that he's a myth.  It reminds me of the quote, \\"The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist\\".  With these incredibly awful foes, it's a wonder Kestrel and Bowman keep their wits about them.  Finally, the book has a deep emotional core that I think will be appreciated by all readers.  The Hath family is very loving and caring.  The bond between the twins is deep and Nicholson deftly portrays the depths of Mumpo's loneliness and despair.  Plus the book has an amazing array of different worlds through which the kids travel.  From the deep mud world below Aramanth to a traveling city on wheels (suspiciously similar those found in the more recent \\"Hungry City Chronicles\\" by fellow Brit, Phillip Reeve), Nicholson creates new worlds out of thin air.  The result is a book that'll have you continually reading for hours on end, unable to stop even part way through.<br /><br />The most recommended fantasy book in schools nation-wide is undeniably Lois Lowry's, \\"The Giver\\".  I suggest that, as good as it is, we give, \\"The Giver\\", a break for once and encourage our kids to read \\"The Wind Singer\\" instead.  Those children that suffer under the strain of repeated testing will appreciate the book's strong message.  Children who like great action sequences and heightened danger will fall for the book's fast-paced escapes and battles.  And those children that simply like a good story with good writing will be entranced.  I say with conviction that this is probably the strongest British fantasy book for children written in the twenty-first century.

493722:US	49148452	R1WCH5FZUPKWEX	0763611182	693040427	The Wishing Bone, and Other Poems	Books	4	9	9	N	N	The time has come, the walrus said, to talk of many things	It all depends on what kinds of poetry you enjoy.  If you, say, enjoy the playful imaginings of good old Lewis Carroll (no mentions of his personal life, if you please) then you may believe, \\"The Wishing Bone and Other Poems\\" to be Caroll-redux.  If, on the other hand, you enjoy straightforward somewhat dull poetry with zippo images or complex wordings, this book is not for you.  If you do not enjoy poetry in the least and would much rather read something factual and non-fiction oriented (say, \\"The Art of War\\"), this book is also not for you.  \\"The Wishing Bone\\" is for the child and adult that loves words.  Loves the ways words can catch you unawares and make you gasp with pleasure at the perfect symmetry of a subtle verse.  If you find yourself reading old children's nonsense poetry thinking, \\"They don't hardly make `em like that anymore\\", you're in for a treat.  A real tangible delight.<br /><br />The book contains only nine poems in total.  That's a particularly small number when you compare it to the poetic offerings of the Shel Silversteins and Jack Prelutskys of the world.  Yet the book doesn't feel brief or stilted.  The poems vary in size and complexity.  Sometimes they're just as long as a single page.  Other times they're lengthy encapsulations of fantastical journeys and magical sights.  Mitchell's subjects could be a girl and a white rhinoceros having tea or a talking chimp hunting an elusive purple tiger.  The poems contemplate everything from the nature of growing up to questions we adults are often too stodgy to ask (like, \\"How long must circles spin around?\\").  The reader will be transported in this book from the banks of sugar-flavored sand to the courtrooms of kangaroos and pigs.  With \\"The Wishing Bone\\" you finish the book and realize that somehow, without quite realizing it, you've grown a little wiser in the course of your reading.<br /><br />But will kids dig it?  That's the real question.  Adults (I flatter myself to be included in that grouping) love to come up with books that they find \\"classic\\" or \\"good\\", paying virtually nada attention to their kiddies' opinions and oppositions.  Personally, I think kids will love this book.  This partly because the poems themselves are expertly written and incredibly imaginative.  It's also in no small part due to the fabulous illustrations of one Mr. Tom Pohrt.  Pohrt has illustrated this book with simple ink and watercolors but given them a life and verve that the author himself could never have imagined.  The pictures are sometimes contemplative, sometimes exciting.  They reminded me a little of Erik Blegvad's pictures in Charlotte Zolotow's, \\"Seasons: A Book of Poems\\" (which I also highly recommend).  Unfortunately, there is one striking difference between Pohrt and Blegvad's books.  While Blegvad was intelligent enough to include the occasional character that wasn't necessarily of white European ancestry, Pohrt seems to live in a white white world.  Not a single person of color appears in this book (there are a lot of people in this book too... even in India), and that's a pity.  Maybe if this book had been published in the 1950s I could've overlooked this mistake.  In this day and age, it's near unforgivable (not to say, baffling).<br /><br />Here's a taste of the book.  As you'll see, it writes in a style indicative of old timey poetry:<br /><br /> \\"I've told this story many times -<br /><br /> To all the magazines,<br /><br /> To paupers and to presidents,<br /><br /> To communists and queens,<br /><br /> To diplomats in formal dress,<br /><br /> And journalists in jeans\\".<br /><br />Obviously I like this passage because it sounds like the Walrus's speech from Carroll's, \\"The Walrus and the Carpenter\\", but I think it stands on its own without necessarily drawing any comparisons.  The whole book is like this.  Silly and introspective and ridiculous and intelligent.  If you've a kid that's open to the joys of good poetry, or even have a child that likes a nicerhyming stanza once in a while, you could hardly do better than 2003's fabulous, \\"The Wishing Bone\\" (not to be confused with the great but very different, \\"The Amazing Bone\\").  This is a book you'll treasure for its beauty and its smarts.  Pity about all the white people though.stanza once in a while, you could hardly do better than 2003's fabulous, \\"The Wishing Bone\\" (not to be confused with the great but very different, \\"The Amazing Bone\\").

They didn't know anything about a mysterious organization called VFD, or suspect the source of the fire that killed their parents.  They were clueless as to where Count Olaf got his information about the orphans' whereabouts, and they'd have been completely baffled if you told them that the eye on Olaf's ankle was more than it seemed.  But with \\"The Slippery Slope\\" the Baudelaires are wiser, if not happier.  Sure they've used their intelligence and resources to get out of multiple sticky nefarious situations.  Yet with this particular offering, the siblings are facing something they've never encountered to this extent before.  They've been split apart from one another.  It's distressing.<br /><br />Far more distressing is the fact that while Sunny has been purloined by Olaf and his creepy crew, Klaus and Violet have been sent down a steep mountain path towards their doom.  After surviving (all thanks to Violet's clear head) the two decide to rescue their baby sister.  Along the way they run into someone they've long since thought dead, and discover a host of information about VFD (though not what it stands for).  Sunny, on her part, becomes a thoroughly resourceful Baudelaire in her own right.  Having been exhausted as a character of her tendency towards biting, Sunny suddenly appears to also be a very clever cook.  This is for the best since Olaf & Co. have decided to use her for all their menial and craft services.  Most babies would balk.  This one's up to the challenge.  And though the ending is, in its way, depressing, it's a bit more cheery than some of the situations faced throughout this text.<br /><br />The author of this book has done a magnificent job detailing the orphans' moral struggles as well.  Having helped the malicious Count Olaf to set the Caligari Carnival on fire in the last book, Klaus and Violet must consider just how much they can be held responsible for their actions.  They've still never really come to terms with the idea of burning stuff up like Olaf, and now the phrase, \\"Fight fire with fire\\", has caused them a great deal of concern as well.  Is it possible to defeat Olaf without lowering themselves to his level?  Just how wrong is it of them to set traps like he does?  And are they actually villains after having helped a villain, or are they victims?  This is heavy stuff for any children's book to handle.  I wouldn't be particularly surprised if kids reading this novella huff a little in exasperation over the orphans' moral qualms.  After all, they've obviously been victimized numerous times.  Still, if the author can convince kids that retaliating against evil with evil is a ridiculous notion, he's done more good than he probably intended.<br /><br />But that's neither here nor there.  The point is that \\"The Slippery Slope\\" is a fine, magnificent, deeply depressing tale that more that deserves to be placed in the overall orphan oeuvre.  The Baudelaires often complain that as time goes by their investigations churn up more questions than answers.  With three books following this one in the series, it's unlikely that this pattern will abate any time soon.  Until then, we'll just have to read each and every Baudelairian adventure be they high or low.  I for one, am delighted with the prospect.

Therefore, I think it's safe to say that were Ms. Simone living today, she would probably eschew the joys of placing her songs in a picture book format.  That doesn't mean, however, that she can't still inspire others to create original picture book works on their own.  \\"The Genie In the Jar\\" is not your typical children's book outing.  It does not contain cute furry animals or adorable humdrum situations like losing a tooth or the first day of kindergarten.  It doesn't have a linear plot or even name its characters.  This is one of those picture books that has decided not to bother with pandering to the standard rules.  As a result, it may well be more appealing to adults than kids.  Or maybe not.  To find out, you need only open its pages and scan it for a little while.<br /><br />The words in this book are like the lyrics of a song that repeat, pause, repeat, leap, and repeat again.  Eschewing punctuation, the book reads, \\"take a note/ and spin it around/ spit it around/ don't/ prick your finger\\".  On the pages, a small black girl spins herself around, running to the safety of her mother when she pricks her finger.  She is surrounded by other members of her family, who form a loose loving circle around her.  Grabbing portions of the sky, she weaves it in this \\"Black loom\\".  And when the words say, \\"take a genie/ and put her in a jar/ put her in a jar/ wrap the sky around her\\", the little girl is enclosed in the loving arms of her mother and surrounded by the circle of her family/community.  She is set free to fly by her parent, but with the final admonishment once more to not prick her finger.<br /><br />No, I don't really understand it very well either.  I've explained it in as clear a manner as I can, but this book takes several readings to completely comprehend.  Both the writer and the illustrator were influenced by the singer Nina Simone, and this is well reflected in the text.  Just the same, it's heavy stuff.  Possibly too heavy for some little ones to understand intrinsically (let alone their parents).  For other children (those of a dreamy otherworldly disposition), it may become their favorite book.  It does have a lovely message, though (a message I had to gather through the bookflap).  The words are simple but layered with different meanings.  The illustrations by Chris Raschka are drawn on thick brown paper.  Sometimes this paper is painted white, or yellow, or black.  The misleadingly messy people pop out at the viewer while melding with their background.  Raschka certainly had his work cut out for him when he decided to illustrate this puppy.  To my mind he's done an admirable job, considering he didn't even have a plot to work from.  My personal favorite moment in this book is when the little girl character suddenly appears on a page wearing a dress the color of the blue sky she was previously weaving in and over her relatives.  From there, it's just a short jump to flight.<br /><br />This is not a book for everyone.  There are people who will pick up this book after reading the title, \\"The Genie In the Jar\\" and expect some kind of fantasy involving... um... genies and jars, I guess.  Let me be clear then when I state that no genies or jars are forthcoming.  This is a complex moral picture book about the role of the individual in relation to the community that has raised them.  It's about the love of families and the strength we gather from those who love us.  Like I said before, I don't know if kids will be able to get the message in this multi-layered format.

Utterly led astray.  In short, Margaret Mahy may well be having a good laugh at my ineptitude.  Having known her to be considered perhaps the greatest young adult fantasy writer in the known world, I picked up \\"The Catalogue of the Universe\\" with my typical snotty snobby snitty opinions of what the story would entail.  Actually, since I like to read books without knowing ANYTHING about the plot ahead of time, my opinions of this book totaled one in number.  I was convinced that this was a fantasy book.  I mean, the title of the book is \\"The Catalogue of the Universe\\" for pete's sake.  The cover shows planets and young swimmy faces.  And it's written by the woman who wrote the illustrious \\"The Changeover\\".  So I picked up, read it through, and kept stopping at the end of each and every chapter to wonder where the magic was.  Let this be a lesson to all, you foolish reviewers like myself who prefer to infer storylines rather than, oh say, read the summaries on the backs of the books.  If you leap to conclusions, you're liable to make a fool of yourself.  And I adore telling the world when I've been silly, so it worked out perfectly for me.  In short (har har), \\"The Catalogue of the Universe\\" is a romantic, emotional, humorous, philosophical tale of two teens and the different ways in which they try to sort out the mysteries of the cosmos/their lives.<br /><br />Angela is beautiful and she knows it.  She's the kind of girl who attracts men with relative ease and lives life exactly as she would like to.  Of course she has a crazy single mom and she lives in a house with an honest-to-goodness outhouse, but that's fine with her.  It's the fact that she's never met her biological father that stings.  All at once charming and impulsive, Angela decides to enmesh her best friend Tycho in her plans to meet her pop for the very first time.  Tycho has his own set of problems, however.  As a particularly romantic and philosophical young man (in no little part due to his name), Tycho's in love with Angela.  They both know this and they both know it's a hopeless situation.  Plus he has a crazy family to deal with and some serious self-esteem issues.  Still, in a series of wild confrontations, escapes, and rescues the two friends begin to learn a little more about themselves and their relationship with the Catalogue of the Universe.<br /><br />Mahy places herself at a disadvantage right from the start.  She's placed her book squarely in the palms of a beautiful female protagonist.  Many otherwise well-written books have faltered with this kind of character (most notably the oft banned, \\"Blood and Chocolate\\").  When a teen girl is beautiful and knows it, it's incredibly difficult not to make her a conceited little cur.  Mahy tries her best to keep Angela under control, but the character is a little too headstrong and wild.  She's likable once in a while but thoroughly detestable others.  You begin to wonder why it is that fabulous Tycho (who I am personally nominating for the Best Datable Young Adult Novel Character Award of 1985) even hangs around her.  Sure she's pretty.  But she's also high-strung and insensitive to others.  In the hands of a lesser writer this would be a distinct problem.  Fortunately, Mahy's clever enough to split Angela's story with Tycho's.  You get an even look at the goings on in both their families.  It was with great relief that the reader leaves Angela's nutty adventures in the wings while Tycho takes the center stage.<br /><br />It's funny, but I haven't even mentioned the scientific, sociological, anthropological, and philosophical discussions that pepper this book.  This is the perfect young adult novel for that kid who thinks about the big questions constantly.  The ideal reader of this book is a teen who understands why Tycho sticks sentences he likes over his bed so that he'll see them first thing in the morning.  Honestly, sometimes the discussions of the universe between Tycho and Angela went a little over my head.  I liked that.  It's a rare feeling to pick up a YA novel and feel left behind.  It makes you want to read the book over and over again.  It makes you want to (gasp, shudder) BUY the book.  This is a feeling I rarely have.  I have it now.<br /><br />Just in case my mention of philosophy scared you off, I'm going to reel you into the I Love The Catalogue of the Universe Club by mentioning its humor.  This book is hee-larious.  Witty banter galore.  If you're a fan of fast-paced conversations containing biting wit, this book is also for you.  Tycho's discussions with his brother, if read aloud, would probably baffle some.  In a conversation with their mother about their older (and over adored) sister Africa, Tycho and his brother Richard discuss their parents' preference:<br /><br />\\"Of course I'm jealous,\\" Richard said, \\"and so is Tycho, aren't you, Tyke?  You often wondered why he was so short.  Well, I'll tell you now: it's jealousy that's stunted him\\".<br /><br /> \\"I tried to grow,\\" Tycho said, responding immediately.  \\"I did my best, but I was weighted down hour after hour by...\\"<br /><br />That's a common conversation.  Fast dialogue and smart characters.  So smart, in fact, that you'll wish you were in the kitchen with them enjoying the full extent of their humor.<br /><br />So the book has it all.  Mind-blowing theorems, romance, likable characters (on the whole), and funny passages.  In short, it's frighteningly well-written.  There aren't enough books in the world to compare to this brilliant little number.  If you know of any teen that wants a book that doesn't talk down to them or patronize them in the least, \\"The Catalogue of the Universe\\" is ideal.  It isn't a fantasy (as I discovered).  It's better.  It's reality in its finest light.ns of the universe between Tycho and Angela went a little over my head.  I liked that.  It's a rare feeling to pick up a YA novel and feel left behind.

At least that's the impression you'll receive after reading Nikki Grimes's eclectic alphabet book.  Picture books have learned something that Sesame Street knew years ago.  Mainly, that kids dig cityscapes filled with letters and numbers.  As a result, \\"C Is For City\\" is a metropolitan dive into the beauty and excitement of the New York City streets.  It's a kickin' little number that teaches kids their alphabetic basics while giving them a taste of the high life.  Even suburbanites will enjoy it.<br /><br />The best way to give you a sense of this concoction is to describe to you the first two pages.  In them you've a fancy lady and her dog driving along a city scene that is both grimy and opulent.  The words on the page read, \\"A is for arcade or ads for apartments/ on short streets with alleys alive with stray pets/ A is for Afghans named after their owners/ who drive them to art shows in silver Corvettes\\".  In the pictures kids can find a variety of different things that all begin with the letter \\"a\\".  Then they can flip to the last page in this book and see if they truly found all the \\"a\\" related objects.  Each page or two page spread in the book is like this.  Sometimes they sport a huge amount of objects.  Other times, there are only a few.  Through it all, Grimes's catchy well-paced alphabetic poems give clues to the various letters in each and every illustration.  By the end of the book you find you've just taken a whirlwind tour through offices, operas, parks, parades, shops, streets, and every imaginable New York cityscape.  It's surprisingly exhausting.<br /><br />It shouldn't surprise much of anybody that Nikki Grimes has written such catchy four line poems.  Best known, perhaps, for her young adult novel, \\"Bronx Masquerade\\", Grimes is adept at poetic license and creation.  Fortunately for her she's been paired with the multi-talented Pat Cummings.  Cummings has packed each page with original situations and multi-racial characters.  Everyone from snooty ladies walking their poodles to Hasidim in their black garb traverse the pages of this book.  Kids reading this story should make sure to try to find the little black cat that pops up in each and every spread.  He's a sneaky one.  The book was originally written in 1995, but even though the pictures show almost every well-known New York landmark (everything from the Washington Square Arch to the Empire State Building), the Twin Towers are nowhere in sight.  Quite by accident, parents everywhere have been saved the necessity of explaining the Towers' significance to their four-year-olds.  Remarkable.<br /><br />Now I'll admit why I didn't give this puppy five stars.  It's basically an unfair reason, but one that I'm unable to break away from.  Anyone who is even vaguely familiar with Graeme Base's, \\"Animalia\\" will note the similarities between that picture book, and this one.  And of the two, \\"Animalia\\" is the better written and illustrated.  So if you want to get your hands on the best alphabetic-find-all-the-objects-slash-animals-beginning-with-a-particular-letter book, this is not the one to purchase.  But if you want TWO of the same kind, kindly locate and whisk away Grimes's, \\"C Is For City\\".  It's definitely an exciting way to present the normally hum-drum alphabet.

499533:US	49148452	RVJUQPX6EW5CT	0618164650	756318437	Run, Boy, Run (Mildred L. Batchelder Honor Book (Awards))	Books	3	1	5	N	N	Elaborate, man, elaborate!	Having recently finished Uri Orlev's remarkable, \\"The Island On Bird Street\\", I decided to give the writer another go.  Orlev has a talent for bringing various stories about the Jewish children of the Holocaust brilliantly to life.  With the aid of translator Hillel Halkin (who has translated most of Orlev's work), the two have penned a series of fantastic tales.  I looked forward to \\"Run, Boy, Run\\" hoping for more of the same.  Certainly the book does tell a gripping story about one boy's methods of survival and escape, but I found the story disjointed and difficult to follow.  In the end, the reader isn't entirely certain what to hope for anymore.  It's a peculiar kind of tale and not up to the high quality of the aforementioned \\"Bird Street\\".  I guess they can't all be winners.<br /><br />Srulik Frydman lives in a large Polish ghetto with his large family during the height of WWII.  One day, while scrounging with his mother for food, Srulik is abandoned by his parent.  Unable to navigate the large town without her, he joins up with a band of ragamuffin orphans.  Thus begins the tale of Srulik's continual escape from authorities and the false stories that keep him alive.  He escapes the ghetto and joins up with another pack of boys.  He meets his father unexpectedly and is advised to act like a Christian to stay alive.  He tends animals, is beaten by a variety of different adults, is captured by the Germans (and escapes) multiple times, looses his right arm, and survives in the end.  Based on a true story, Orlev has shown us how difficult it is to crush a human life.  Srulik's struggle and eventual triumph is a worthy subject of praise and admiration.<br /><br />Of course, the only reason we know that this even IS a true story is that in the book's Epilogue we are given an explanation of the rest of the boy's life and how the author came to hear his story.  This doesn't really clear up whether or not all of this book is true, though.  Many sections could have easily been fabricated.  It's impossible to say since the author hasn't credited Srulik with any praise or aid.  So how much of this are we allowed to believe?  I'd like to say all of it, but I haven't any proof to back this up.  Then again, if this book is simply a rote retelling of actual events, that would probably account for its jumpy narrative.  Srulik isn't in a household more than five pages before he's thrown out, chased out, or has to escape from that place of residence.  His adventures are spotty and lacking in a natural ebb and flow.  I can understand if this is because it's based on real events and Orlev's just trying to tell the story exactly as it happened, but shouldn't he have said as much in a Forward to the book?<br /><br />Some of the plot elements in this story may surprise unsuspecting parents.  Though marketed for kids, I've rarely come across a book that contained quite so much sexual situations (these tend to be situations that Srulik stumbles across) and penis gazing.  The only way in which people can tell that our hero is Jewish is by checking to see whether or not he's been circumcised.  As a result, Orlev has had to come up with a variety of different situations in which Srulik ends up dropping trou.  Sometimes these are clever situations.  Other times (such as during a peeing contest) they strain incredulity.<br /><br />Another problem with the tale is that the book suffers from many a translated story's dangers.  Emotional content is not displayed particularly well.  In \\"The Island On Bird Street\\" you understood why the main character was unemotional most of the time.  After all, he was deliberately trying not to think of the situation he was in and he was old enough to know that that was the best solution.  In \\"Run, Boy, Run\\", however, Srulik starts the tale incredibly early and looses his mother almost immediately.  A small child that's lost its mother is going to, quite frankly, flip out or at least cry over the loss.  Srulik never sheds so much as a tear (until about the end of the book, by which point he's crying over a variety of different things).  The cold tone that suited \\"Bird Street\\" so well hurts, \\"Run, Boy, Run\\" (much to my chagrin).<br /><br />Which isn't to say that this book isn't worth reading.  I think it's a fine piece of literature, but seriously flawed in a variety of ways.  If you've a kid who doesn't mind reading a tale that hops, skips, and jumps from person to person and place to place without so much as a howdy-doo, then \\"Run, Boy, Run\\" should suit them fine.  Otherwise, I suggest you grab \\"The Island On Bird Street\\" instead.  Orlev's later offering may be based on a true subject, but his writing should have been a little better in order that he might honor that person more fully.about the end of the book, by which point he's crying over a variety of different things).

When you hear the word, \\"watercolors\\", you may immediately think of soft dreamy landscapes and lovely vistas.  \\"Watercolors\\", the word, does not conjure up vibrant images and exciting chase sequences.  And yet that is exactly what you will find in Robert Blake's visually astounding, \\"Fledgling\\".  A simple tale about the day in the life of a young bird, the illustrations in this book are topsy-turvy twistings of perspective and distance.  It can single-handedly change how you feel about the art of watercolors.<br /><br />Even before you reach the book's title page you see a single page displaying three tentative birdies.  Says the text, \\"Today is the day we are all going to fly\\".  And there you have it.  A single kestral (a member of the falcon family that may live in metropolitan areas) is about to learn how to fly.  At first the bird is tentative and resorts merely to gliding.  Subsequently, however, it's figured out the logistics of good flying.  And not a minute too soon.  Appearing out of the upper left corner dive a pair of sharp speedy claws.  The rest of the book consists of the kestral trying frantically to escape from a hungry hawk.  Through the roller coasters of Coney Island!  Into the subway car of the D train!  Up and up and away they fly, until the kestral is free but lost.  Fortunately a friendly cry from its family leads our hero home.  Happy and safe.<br /><br />This is one of those cases where the story is fine but you've undoubtedly seen it one hundred times before.  It's the pictures that let it stand out.  In his note at the back of the book, Blake explains how he was inspired to create this story.  He describes the pains he took to draw falcons, \\"in every conceivable position\\".  The result is a book that clearly reflects his efforts.  Our hero spreads his beautifully spotted wings amid the streets of modern day Brooklyn.  Every stripe and feather is in place on this magnificently rendered animal.  Blake, having mastered the bird itself, then shifts the viewer's perspective.  One minute you're looking up at the kestral from below as it flies by an intricately designed ferris wheel.  The next minute you're looking down on it as it searches the city streets for its family.  The twisting images and skewed scenes are mesmerizing.  Best of all, Blake includes some fabulous details with his story.  Be sure to notice the dogs that break away from their walkers to follows the two birds into the subway's depths.<br /><br />I could go on all day about these pictures.  I could mention how well Blake uses light and shadow, or how perfectly the buildings bend within the pages.  I could point out the advantage of a blue headed hero (especially when he's poised against a metropolitan background) or the fine-lined illustrations that make every picture interesting.  Heck, the book's even occasionally broken up into three or four separate columns, according to the needs of the text.  I'm disheartened by the fact that \\"Fledgling\\" did not garner its own Caldecott Honor, let alone Award.  It's also a little sad to see the Twin Towers standing proud and tall on the cover, though Blake is hardly to blame for that.  And there are some slight inconsistencies in the kestral's colors from picture to picture.  There ends all my complaints of this book.  As it stands, I feel \\"Fledgling\\" is one of the strongest picture books out there.  Children everywhere will identify with the bird's sense of loss and powerlessness, and will enjoy the ending just a bit more as a result.

Walk up to your local children's librarian.  Comment idly on the weather, the news, the local sports team, etc.  Banter.  Then, when the moment presents itself, slyly drop the name of Leon Garfield.  If you're dealing with a librarian that knows their chops and has, in the course of their work, come across this most magnificent author, you're bound you be treated to an extended dialogue regarding the most noble qualities of that fine and outstanding writer.  If, on the other hand, you are dealing with an amateur fan of kiddie lit who's knowledge extends only so far as the latest \\"Magic Treehouse\\" offering, you may not garner much of a response.  Pity them, in such a case, for Leon Garfield is one of those writers that restore your faith in the beauty of children's literature (especially after reading the aforementioned \\"Magic Treehouse\\").  If you don't know where to start in the Garfield oeuvre, I recommend the eclectic, \\"Smith\\".  Winner of a Phoenix Award (given to those great works of children's literature that are gone but not forgotten), the book has been republished relatively recently and is well worth your perusal.  If you haven't read this book, you're in for treat.<br /><br />Picture yourself in Victorian England.  Better yet, picture Smith there.  He's a twelve-year-old ragamuffin with a penchant for picking ample sized pockets.  Living by his wits (and in the care of his two elder seamstress sisters), Smith leads a relatively happy life.  That is, until he picks the pocket of a soon-to-be-dead man.  With a piece of parchment in his hand that is the sole reason the old man was killed, Smith must learn to read and unravel the paper's mystery.  Along the way he'll be hunted, jailed, frozen, and taken under a blind man's wing.  Smith runs, jumps, and skips from one desperate situation to another.  By the book's finale the reader is so thoroughly engrossed that Smith's adventures seem to burst off the page.  You've never rooted for a gamin quite as plucky (or snarky) as Smith.  And you probably never will again.<br /><br />There's one word that pops into the brain when you read \\"Smith\\": Dickensian.  If you've a kid that you want to lure into the world of Charles Dickens and you've exhausted your \\"A Christmas Carol\\" resources, consider \\"Smith\\" to be a book in the same vein.  The character of Smith himself is almost the anti-Oliver Twist.  For where Oliver was a pale saintly little urchin who detested his underworld companions, Smith's more along the lines of the Artful Dodger.  A pickpocket by trade, he rubs shoulders with some of the dingiest characters imaginable.  Everyone from highwaymen to the upper crust of the debtor's prison.  Leon Garfield conjures up a remarkably lifelike England of old.  You see the dirt that encrusts little Smith.  You smell the rank streets and unwashed masses.  His prose is at some times remarkably beautiful.  Consider this sentence that describes a lonely graveyard: \\"Still and silent was the little garden where the dead were planted and bloomed in stone\\".  This is an average lovely Garfieldian statement.  At the same time, this book is chock full of fun and wit.  What good is it to be a good writer if you can't be funny from time to time?  \\"Smith\\" is funny and jovial and brimming with good humor, even in its bleakest moments.<br /><br />Kids today have acquired a newfound taste for somewhat gothic tales of old.  The ever popular, \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\", draws upon a variety of classic Victorian themes.  If you've a child that's been hooked on those books, it might be remarkably easy to connect them to \\"Smith\\" as well.  Also consider pairing it with Joan Aiken's, \\"The Wolves of Willoughby Chase\\" or Philip Pullman's, \\"The Ruby In the Smoke\\" for a classic touch.  I should clarify that \\"Smith\\" is more than just an Intro to Dickens, or particularly repetitive.  It's an original work in and of itself and deserves to be examined in that light.  Thoughit was written roughly 40 years ago, it's still a lively jaunty little tale.  There's not a trace of mildew about it.  Nothing old or decrepit.  No, \\"Smith\\" is just the kind of well-written book of fiction that makes you wish every undiscovered classic was this good.  A gem.t.

They sit on their high horses passing judgment without ever taking into consideration the feelings of the authors whose works they degrade.  And the worst part of it is, the authors have no recourse with which to defend themselves.  If a reviewer calls a book, \\"vile dribble\\", the writer of the dribble has to sit and take it.  Maybe they'll write something snarky on their blog, but that's it.  I'm saying all of this because I'm about to become one of those reviewers myself.  I look at \\"Shadowmancer\\" by G.P. Taylor and I think about what a labor of love this must have been for him.  I am certain that he has been exceedingly pleased with his work and proud of how far and wide his messages have been carried.  And I feel badly, because I'm about to tear this book into tiny shreds before your very eyes.  Not out of malice (though in some cases I'm not above it) but because I feel that huge swaths of people are being misled into reading it.  \\"Shadowmancer\\" is a very earnest, very poorly written work of juvenile fiction.  It sets out to tell a gripping story with a moral core.  It ends up telling a sadly awful tale with a moral core.<br /><br />On the Yorkshire coastline our story begins.  The vicar Demurral, an absinthe drinker of unusual desires, has received a small stolen statue of unlimited power.  With it, Demurral seeks to find its twin, take over the world, and become God.  A tad ambitious.  Unfortunately for him, the vicar fails to consider that the statue's twin is, in fact, a young man of flesh and blood.  Having traveled miles from his home in Africa, Raphah is the only thing Demurral needs to complete his evil plan.  Fortunately, Raphah has enlisted the help of two local kids, Thomas and Kate.  Between the three of them they do everything possible to stop Demurral and fight the evil vicious forces that seek the end of Heaven.  To succeed they'll need a great deal of faith in God and love of their fellow man.  Something Demurral could never understand.<br /><br />I knew perfectly well what this book was when I picked it up.  Ever since its initial British publication the world has been calling this puppy, \\"The Christian alternative to Harry Potter\\".  Due to the fact that Harry Potter isn't exactly something Christian's need an \\"alternative\\" to in the first place, this statement rankled with me.  Still, I decided to keep an open mind.  After all, there are some wonderful Christian-infused children's books out there.  Things like, \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\", and \\"A Wrinkle In Time\\".  What sets \\"Shadowmancer\\" apart from these books, however, is the fact that while the other tales discuss Christian images and imagery behind a thin veil of metaphor, \\"Shadowmancer\\" takes its Christian message and whops you soundly over the head with it.  Still, I didn't mind that either.  In fact, the scenes in \\"Shadowmancer\\" that discuss religion are the best-written parts of the book.  This is probably because Taylor is vicar himself and writes the stuff regularly.  It's the rest of \\"Shadowmancer\\" that's a hopeless mess.  I'll give you some of my favorite examples.<br /><br />Example One:  The following two sentences which appear in the book exactly as I have written them:  \\"It was like standing in the eye of a storm, whilst all around was chaos.  In the centre of the cave floor the fire burnt even brighter, whilst all around, his books, candles, bread and blankets danced and swirled in the air\\".  How many times does an author need to say \\"whilst all\\" in a single paragraph?<br /><br />Example Two: \\"A small figure leapt out of the darkness at Thomas and Raphah, grabbing them both by the throat and pushing them facedown onto the ground\\".  Please explain to me how exactly you grab someone by the throat and then push them facedown.  Methinks he meant to say \\"neck\\".<br /><br />Example Three:  You can tell Kate, our heroine of this tale, is female because, \\"her wide blue eyes and glowing skin gave away the fact she was a girl\\".  That and the fact that she's usually sobbing, saying how frightened she is, or acting in a \\"hysterical\\" manner.  She fights once in a while, true.  But usually she's twenty times more emotional than her male counterparts.<br /><br />None of this even touches on the inadequacies of the text though.  This book was written in a style very similar to the recent book \\"Eragon\\".  That would be fine except that \\"Eragon\\" was written by a fifteen-year-old.  What's \\"Shadowmancer\\"'s excuse?  And heck, at least \\"Eragon\\" has a fast paced interesting ending.  Not to give anything away, but \\"Shadowmancer\\" begins with a bang and ends with a whimper.  Loose ends are left loose.  Characters react in ways that make very little sense.  Sentences are written poorly, timelines are confused, descriptions are either too vague or contradictory.... In short the book is badly written.  At its finale, the book ends abruptly.  We know that there's a sequel to it, but even books with sequels know enough to end each story on a final note.  \\"Shadowmancer\\" fails even in this respect.<br /><br />I could say more, but I've tired myself out.  You see what I mean though about book reviewers being bullies at heart?  What can G.P. Taylor do to defend himself against my criticisms?  Nothing really.  But the fact of the matter is, there wouldn't be much he could say anyway.  My objection to this book isn't with its message or use of religious imagery.  It's the fact that the man cannot for the life of him write well.  Too much of this book is left unsaid or said poorly.  If you want good Christian fiction, read the books I've already mentioned.  If you want trendy sub-par kiddie lit that doesn't get its message across in a convincing fashion, \\"Shadowmancer\\" is for you.her wide blue eyes and glowing skin gave away the fact she was a girl\\".

My husband grew up in Atlanta, Georgia and well remembers the Anase stories that were told to him and his companions in their youth. For myself, Anase was not a character I heard much about as a child. This is a pity when you consider that books like, \\"A Story A Story\\" were striving to teach children about the great African (I apologize for not knowing the exact region) folktales. Based on one of many spider stories, \\"A Story A Story\\" is a variation on the Prometheus tale. In this case, however, the desired gift of the gods isn't fire but that of stories themselves.<br /><br />As the tale tells us, long ago all the stories in the world belonged to the Sky God. On behalf of mankind, Anase (presented here not as a spider but as a kind of old spider man) spins a web into the sky and requests the Sky God's stories. The big man upstairs is amused by the request and presents Anase with a series of three near impossible tasks. If the spider man is able to accomplish them, he will be granted the stories. Using his wits and some clever techniques, Anase accomplishes each trial and in the end the world receives a golden box of the Sky God's stories.<br /><br />Just looking at this tale I realized that it was a perfect companion picture book to Marcia Brown's \\"Once a Mouse\\". In both cases woodcut illustrations decorate a well-known fable from a land other than America. In this particular book, children at all familiar with the Brer Rabbit tarbaby story will instantly recognize elements of it in \\"A Story A Story\\". Adults could then let their kids know that slaves from Africa would often bring their stories with them, changing them in their new land with some subtle variations. The book itself is illustrated beautifully with what looks to be a series of brightly colored woodcuts. Be sure to locate other fine Anase stories (they exist in abundance, doncha know) if this one suits your fancy. It reflects beautifully the cleverness and richness of a story not too new to our American ears.ican ears.	2004-10-02

When I picked up the picture book, \\"Down In the Subway\\" I was thinking it would be one of those staid and serious tales about what the subway is like.  There would have been explanations about trains and lines and who built the tunnels and stuff like that.  And I'm sure that there are books out there that list such information.  This just isn't one of them.  Nope, this is a Caribbean-infused tale of one boy's amazing subway trip.  It's bright and fun and offer a great deal of surrealism for the kiddies.<br /><br />Oscar and his mom and little brother are taking the 1 Line on the subway home.  Oscar's a little shy, but he keeps looking at an Island Lady sitting on the train near him.  The lady, \\"smiled a fine Islands smile\\" and asks the boy if he'd like to know what she has in her bag.  Before you know it she's pulled cooled island breezes from its depths.  She's removed the sea itself, delicious island foodstuffs (ackee rice, salt fish, callaloo, pineapple, and coconut tarts), as well as a Calypso Man.  She pulls out a steel drum band and then an entire Island town itself.  Then, in the midst of the entire subway car dancing and partying to beat of the band, Oscar and his mom reach their stop (125th street).  They wave goodbye to the mysterious Island Lady and they never see her again.  But that's okay.  Oscar's remembered her song and, \\"sang it so much, pretty soon his baby brother could sing it too\\".<br /><br />Author Miriam Cohen has truly penned a \\"Cat in the Hat\\", Manhattan style.  But where the Cat's bag only held objects that wreaked destruction, the Island Lady's bag contains objects that bring a whole lotta good times.  There's a great rhythm to the text of this tale.  The repetitive phrase, \\"don't you know\\", ties the book together.  The trippy Calypso Man's song offers a beat (which, if you can find a calypso tune to attach to it, could definitely be the high point of the text).  There's a lot of life and verve to this tale and it's a pleasure to read.  In a way, I wish the illustrations matched it perfectly.  For the most part they do.  Though they initially look to be cut paper pictures, they're actually just bright paints.  The images pop out at you so brilliantly that you assume they're layered colored paper.  Some of the perspectives are a little screwy here and there, but on the whole they're fun to flip through.  If there is a severe flaw in this book, however, and it's the inclusion of the 125th street subway stop.  I think author Miriam Cohen has visited that stop or she probably wouldn't have included it.  Illustrator Melanie Hope Greenberg, however, has obviously never been there.  125th street stop (on the 1 or 9 Line) is one of the rare elevated subway stops out of doors.  In the illustration, however, this line is supposed to be underground.  Greenberg assumed all subway stops look the same and drew it without doing her research.  Naughty Greenberg.  Naughty.<br /><br />But that's the extent of my criticism.  On the whole, \\"Down In the Subway\\" is a great what-if story.  It combines the realistic workings of mass transportation with the bright n' shiny rhythms of the sweet Caribbean seas.  This book would be a fine pair with the similarly rhythmed, \\"Chicka Chicka Bang Bang\\".  Consider them both for your next storytime, but only if you've an ear for bouncy texts.  This book would definitely suffer if it was read by someone monotonely toned.  So hep yourself up on caffeine and read the joyful text of \\"Down In the Subway\\" when the mood is right.

Then there are books like \\"My Friend Rabbit\\".  Roughly a year ago I wanted to know what all the \\"My Friend Rabbit\\" fuss was about.  I mean, this book was a 2003 Caldecott Award winner after all.  I wanted to see why.  So I went to my local independent bookstore and flipped through it.  I flipped and flipped and was baffled by the heaping helpfuls of praise it had received.  My haphazard flipping didn't reveal anything particularly interesting or original in the story.  Fast forward a year and I've finally taken the time to sit down and read, \\"My Friend Rabbit\\" in its entirety (a process which took me all of 93 seconds).  Suddenly I understood why it was so beloved.  Though an incredibly simple plot, story, and set of characters, \\"My Friend Rabbit\\" is a remarkably beautiful tale of two woodland creatures and their plane related misadventures.  It's simple in words and complex in visuals.<br /><br />As Mouse points out from the beginning, \\"My friend Rabbit means well.  But whatever he does, wherever he goes, trouble follows\\".  That's Mouse's nice way of saying that Rabbit is an all-time screw-up.  In this particular outing, Rabbit has managed to get Mouse's brand new airplane (in which Mouse fits like a furry little Lindbergh) stuck in a tree sans Mouse.  Quick as a wink Rabbit's off with a, \\"Not to worry, Mouse.  I've got an idea!\\" thrown over his shoulder.  Before you know it he's tugged, dragged, carried, and cajoled a wide variety of animals to stand on one another under the offending tree.  Mouse is just able to reach the wing of his plane when the entire group comes crashing to the ground.  Rabbit is in big big trouble.  Fortunately the plane is now free and two go happily off into the sky.  That is, until Rabbit steers them a tad off course.  The last words in the book are a too familiar, \\"Not to worry, Mouse.  I've got an idea\\".  Readers can guess what'll happen next.<br /><br />Ho hum, you say.  I've seen stories of this ilk before.  I won't contest that.  Maybe you've seen a dozen similarly ilked picture books in your day.  Maybe you're an old hat in the clumsy-rabbit-gets-in-and-out-of-scrapes genre of storytelling.  This might all be the case.  But you have never, I say I say, NEVER seen anything like this colorful concoction of animalistic cajolery.  First of all, the book in and of itself is beautiful to look at.  Filled with hand-colored relief prints spanning a rainbow of different colors, the story looks like a series of cheery rounded woodblock images more than anything else.  Rohmann's characters are beautifully expressive and original.  Each animal has its own personality and individual traits.  From the somewhat perturbed goose to the blissfully unaware hippo, they all act, look, and react in different ways.  Rohmann isn't afraid to make use of every inch of page space either.  Sometimes an image on one page will be of just rabbit pulling on a trunk.  The next two page spread is then completely filled with the elephant as Rabbit hops away for more animalia.  Pictures will suddenly becomes vertical as suits the story (as when they're standing on one another to reach the tree).  There are even pictures that display nothing more than impending doom.  When the animals fall from their tower you get a brief image of the baby geese that didn't participate in the Babel-like construction running for cover, just before the creatures hit.  And visual humor has never been so beautifully realized as in this tale.  There is a shot of every single animal (save mouse and the still smiling hippo) glaring at Rabbit with undisguised malice after their unintentional plummet.  Rabbit, who up until this time has had eyes that were simple black dots, looks straight at the viewer with the whites of his eyes very very visible.  It's one of those pictures that says a million different things and could only have been drawn in the last ten years.  After all, how many picture books can you name off the top of your head where the hero stares at the viewer in fear?<br /><br />Not that it really matters, but I fully support the fact that \\"My Friend Rabbit\\" won all the awards that it did.  Books of its nature are rarities.  This tale is funny, touching, beautiful, and engagingly constructed.  It is colorful.  It is well-thought out.  It is a classic in the purest sense of the word.  It is a wonderful adventure, a touching tale, and a great great book.  I praise it with all the praising strength with which I am endowed.

Reading Chicken Soup With Rice	These days, when a person says, \\"chicken soup\\" they're probably going to follow up those words with, \\"for the soul\\" or maybe \\"for the teenaged soul\\".  Didn't used to be that way.  Why I can remember a time when if a person said, \\"chicken soup\\" those words were followed by an enthusiastic \\"with rice!\\".  Such was the power of Maurice Sendak's catchy 1962 children's book.  I am pleased to report that if you care to read this book again today, you will find it hasn't dimished a jot in terms of frolicksome fun.  In this book we are led through a whirlwind chicken soup year with our host, a boy who bears no little resemblance to Sendak's other great rhyming tale \\"Pierre\\" (in looks if not demeanor).  It's a catchy flouncy bouncy combo of soup and the people who love it so.<br /><br />This is ostensibly a book meant to teach your children the different months of the year.  Each month gets its own rhythmic poem and accompanying illustration.  These are fairly simple pen and ink drawings with the occasional splash of blue (in varying shades), yellow, gray, and green.  You may wonder how an author could ever hope to come up with twelve highly original soup-related poems.  I mean, honestly, how much is there to say about even the fanciest soup, let alone chicken soup with rice?  Quite a lot, as it happens.  In the cold winter months soup is supped while sliding on ice, while celebrating the birthday of a snowman, and in a gusty gale as a whale.  In the spring there's robin's nest soup, soup to cure drooping roses, and soup stolen by jealous March winds.  Our hero postulates the potential joys that could come of being a cooking pot, stewing soup or (oddly enough) as \\"a baubled bangled Christmas tree\\".<br /><br />Not to degrade the reading skills of parents everywhere, but I cannot recommend enough getting an audio version of this tale to accompany your child's reading.  Though I am now a wise and cultured 26 year-old (the years have been kind to me in this, my old age) I can still remember the chicken soup with rice tune.  Heck, I read this entire book recently and found I could do the song perfectly with each and every line.  Now maybe you have your own particular chicken soup with rice song style that you're just loathe to give up.  If so, fine.  I understand why you might not want to taint your already existing chicken soup melody.  But if you haven't found a jingle to accompany this book, get the audio version immediately, if not sooner.  Until you can sing \\"Whoopy once, whoopy twice, whoopy chicken soup with rice\\" with the correct oomph, you're missing out.<br /><br />I take my \\"Chicken Soup With Rice\\" readings seriously.  This book was the \\"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom\\" of its day, and still remains the catchiest method to teach kids the months of the year.  It is also seriously in danger of being forgotten.  So pull out your old accordion and strap on your dancing shoes.  The time for yukkin' it up to a merry dance of poultry broth is here.

It is the dearest wish of my heart that maybe, someday, I will be lucky enough to someday become a real honest-to-goodness children's book reviewer.  To succeed in this goal, however, I feel that I must give myself a thorough background in children's books.  As a result, I've found myself reviewing many books that, while considered \\"classics\\" are stories I would not be reading today if it weren't for their cultural cache.  I'm saying all of this because I want you to understand fully why I did not want to read \\"The Island On Bird Street\\" at the outset.  I'm the gal who as a child refused to read books that even traipsed lightly upon any and all serious subjects.  No realistic situations for me, thank you very much.  So it shouldn't surprise you the amount of resistance I felt towards reading Uri Orlev's classic Holocaust drama.  But I'm 26 years old and if a 26 year old can't read a serious children's book, they probably have something seriously wrong with them.  With that cheery thought in mind, I bit the bullet and plunged in.  I was expecting a depressing treatise on the horrors of war and the depravity of Nazi Germany.  And that's part of the book, no question.  But what I didn't expect, and found (much to my delight) was a story that also read like a WWII Robinson Crusoe.  It comes as a great relief.<br /><br />As our Jewish hero, Alex and his family begin this tale as members of a Polish ghetto in an unnamed town during WWII.  Actually, it's just Alex and his father at this point.  His mother disappeared not long ago and is suspected to have been taken away by the occupying German forces.  When it becomes clear to Alex's father that his son will probably need to survive on his own someday (a day that comes sooner than either of them think) he teaches the boy how to keep and shoot a gun.  Not long after, Alex's father is taken away by the Germans as well, but with the promise that he will be back to find Alex soon.  What follows is a tale that tracks the boy in an abandoned ghost town of a ghetto.  On his own, he must find food and shelter while remaining hidden from the ever present Nazi threat.  Too soon Alex finds that in this hostile environment, he can only really trust himself and his white mouse, Snow.  Using ingenuity that astounds, Alex carves out an existence for himself that not only defies everything the Nazis stand for but that speaks to the heart of anyone who has ever waited for a loved one to return.  By the end of this book Alex is no Jewish boy.  He is a Jewish man.<br /><br />If you were to ask me what book \\"The Island on Bird Street\\" most resembles, I would have to say without a doubt that it is mighty similar to Gary Paulsen's, \\"Hatchet\\".  In both cases, young men must survive hunger and hostile surroundings by using their brains.  In a way though, \\"Bird Street\\" is less harrowing than \\"Hatchet\\".  Alex may not be particularly safe, but he is oddly confident of his own abilities at all times.  This is a kid cut out for survival.  His cool confident handling of his situation may strike some as a little false.  Even when his mother disappears, Alex treats her vanishing with little real woe (at least none that he displays for the reader).  This may have more to do with Orlev's writing style than any particular flaw in the plot though.  After all, it isn't as if Alex is a particularly emotional fellow.  True, he bursts into tears once in a while (justifiably) and falls in love with a girl across the ghetto wall, but he does not allow himself to think too much on painful things.  They might weigh him down and make him incapable of rational thinking and planning.  As a result, when Alex thinks it is in a methodical and intelligent manner.  Just not ooey-gooey.<br /><br />Getting back to the \\"Hatchet\\" similarities, my favorite parts of this book were those sections that described how Alex constructed a safe home for himself on the third floor of a bombed out old building.  I loved the Robinson Crusoeish aspects of the story.  Reading through this book, you really feel a kid like Alex could survive in an environment such as this in real life.  He's a realistic character acting in ways that are consistent with his age.  When Alex starts ice skating and playing football on the other side of the ghetto wall, you completely understand why (even if you're cringing at the thought of him risking his neck like that).  I should note that there are some sections that speak laudably of the state of Israel.  This is also realistic within the context of the story, but it's hard to make an idyllic picture of Israel when thinking of the oh-so similar violence wracking it today.  To my mind, Orlev would have done very well to completely avoid all mention of the topic.  It jars anyone with even the tiniest political knowledge out of the story.<br /><br />Author Uri Orlev was himself a Jewish person living in the Warsaw ghetto before the second world war.  A survivor of Bergen-Bergen, it would be a supreme understatement to point out that the man knows of which he speaks.  I was especially grateful to him for including an Introduction to this story that explains not only the horrors of the time period but also exactly what Jewish ghettos were.  This isn't taught in school all that often and it makes the text far easier to understand.  Orlev has written a masterful and heartfelt story of human struggle and survival.  Consider pairing this book with the aforementioned \\"Hatchet\\" or (if you prefer similar time periods and protagonists) \\"The Diary of Anne Frank\\" and Lois Lowry's, \\"Number the Stars\\".  I was reluctant to pick up \\"The Island On Bird Street\\" to begin with.  But if kids follow my hesitant example and read a chapter or two into it, they may find themselves surprisingly interested in the adventures of a boy living all on his own.

Now it's time to learn a little bit about some of the lesser known were-arcana.  Take wereowls for example.  You rarely run across them in literature.  That makes Owl Tycho all the more interesting.  Owl (not the most original name she could have received, but we'll overlook that for now) is fourteen years of age and in love in a savage desperate way.  She is obsessed with her science teacher Mr. Lindstrom, a man she freely admits is middle aged and pudgy, with thinning hair.  Changing into an owl nightly, she sits outside his window to watch him as he sleeps.  Soon, however, she notices someone else who is also interested in the object of her affections.  A young man, pale and starved, has taken to staring into the house and occasionally stealing supplies from it.  Unraveling the mystery of this stranger stretches Owl to the limit, testing her fragile first friendship with a human girl and trapping her in her owl-like form.  She may old for fourteen, but Owl has a lot to learn about how to act with people.  Especially when they're a lot more similar to her than she may think.<br /><br />I had enjoyed Patrice Kindl's fabulous and nightmarish, \\"The Woman In the Walls\\" a while ago so I had high hopes for \\"Owl In Love\\".  Sadly, \\"Owl\\" disappointed me a little.  The beginning of the tale is a little weak, with Owl speaking in an odd stilted manner.  Eventually, it becomes clear that Kindl is writing Owl as she would an actual owl in the woods.  Her personality should therefore be a little aloof and alien to us, and once that idea sinks it it's a little easier to get into.  For a while though, it's rough going.  Then you find that you like the heroine, for all that she's a bit rude to the people around her (social niceties weren't exactly taught in her home). About the time Owl's friend Dawn mentions that the teacher Mr. Lindstrom has a son... well you can probably figure out exactly what and when everything's going to happen in this book.  It's predictable, but enjoyable.  That sounds like backhanded praise, I admit, but I mean what I say.  Plus Kindl has a fun humor-filled writing style that more than makes up for the occasional flaw.  Owl, afraid of the bus she takes to Dawn's home, refers to it sourly as a, \\"mobile home of the damned\\".  She also points out the embarrassment she once felt when an older owl made a pass at her one night.  \\"He then began to dance in a most ridiculous and undignified way, shuffling about on the branch we shared, looking like a justice of the Supreme Court performing a striptease\\".  Visual.  Effective.<br /><br />So \\"Owl In Love\\" isn't the best fantasy I've read, no.  But it's a fun concept and an enjoyable tale.  I have heard that students reading this book have been able to identify to the book's theme of \\"outsiders\\" and \\"parents who cannot help their own children\\" to their own lives.  That's the point of good fantasy, and I like to think that since the book succeeds, it should remain in the canon of late 20th century young adult fiction.  You may agree with some of the things I've said and you may disagree.  Regardless of how you feel about the book, I still recommend \\"Owl In Love\\" to anyone who wants a book that's fun, not too long, and exciting.  Few books manage to combine these three elements in a convincing way.  \\"Owl In Love\\" does it with ease., it becomes clear that Kindl is writing Owl as she would an actual owl in the woods.

509024:US	49148452	R1A93AW6B06J67	1582343853	372577569	Rats: Observations on the History and Habitat of the City's Most Unwanted Inhabitants	Books	4	4	7	N	N	He smells a rat (or two)	I recently moved to New York City for the first time in my Midwestern based lifetime and like any good transplant I wanted to locate a book about my new home.  I glanced over books about New York walking tours, and skimmed the aisles that lauded NYC history.  Then my eyes alighted on a delightful little number that looked as if it might tell me things about Manhattan in a way no one else was able to.  If choosing a book about the rats of New York sounds a little... well... disgusting, you're right.  It most certainly is.  But Sullivan's book is so engaging and light-hearted that though its subject may be a bit tawdry, not to say downright gross, it's certainly never dull.<br /><br />Robert Sullivan was last seen writing the fabulous book, \\"Meadowlands\\", about the marshlands of New Jersey (and what they contain).  It's not too much of a leap from the marsh to the alley, and that's definitely the course Sullivan wishes to take.  \\"Rats\\" is a clever history of humanity's parasitic kin.  Concentrating his tale specifically to the rats of New York City (or, to be precise, the Rattus norvegicus), Sullivan documents his own personal discoveries about the perpetually hungry l'il buggers.  He scouts out his own private nirvana in the appropriately named Eden Alley, where he is able to watch the comings and goings of a whole swath of brown rats.  He peppers his tale with side trips to various exterminators, pest control specialists, health inspectors, homeless citizens, and best of all the rodent control superstar Bobby Corrigan.  On top of that, Sullivan gives a rat's eye view of the history of pests in New York City and, to some extent, around the United States itself.  Everything from the plague of San Francisco to the Battle of Golden Hill touches on rats and their environment.  We watch the sanitation workers' strike of 1968 and the 1979 mass rat attack of a woman by New York's Theatre Alley.  The book is a hugely ambitious and successful outing into the world o' rodentia.<br /><br />Drawing on sources from Emerson to Coleridge, Sullivan is the best possible guide into the stinking cesspools of New York's lower echelons.  His humor and ear for amusing stories also help to make him incredibly readable.  It's difficult to write a sentence with deadpan wit, but I think Sullivan knows his material.  Take, for example, his discussion of a Washington rat specialist, mentioning that, \\"a revisionist school has tried to argue lately that the Nixon rats weren't that bad\\".  Or that in the days of professional rat fighting (in which dogs were placed in pits with rats and made to kill them in as quick a time as possible) setting ferrets against rats was considered too slow to enjoy and therefore only good sport for women and children to watch.  At the same time, Sullivan is prone to his own Thoreau-esque meanderings.  Consider, for example, this sentence:  \\"I heard the sounds of nighttime in an alley: the far-off moan of hydraulics from a truck digesting trash; the toss of ice and stale flower water from a delicatessen into a gutter; a garbage bag, first lofted and, soon, crashing to the ground with a splatch\\".  It's enough to almost make you want to join Sullivan in his nighttime rat outings.  Almost.<br /><br />I think what makes this book so very interesting is Sullivan's attachment to his subjects.  Yet this book isn't the literary equivalent of \\"Willard\\" or anything.  This author retains a healthy revulsion at getting too close to his swarmy little rats.  At the same time, he finds them infinitely interesting.  He is perhaps the only person to fully document the effects of the crash of the World Trade Towers on the surrounding rodent community.  He travels in amazing circles, learning more about rats and their connection to humanity than has ever been thought out to this degree before.  In many ways this book is just as much about the history of New York City as it is the vermin that inhabit it (human and otherwise).<br /><br />Most professional reviews I read of this book mostly concentrated on the funny facts Sullivan mentions, and this is a great part of the book (learning, for example, that rats have sex twenty times a day).  But it is not the bulk of the book.  The bulk is a multi-faceted look into our relationship, as humans, to these disease-bearing, intelligent little curs.  Few writers have deigned to give us such an in-depth look into the world of rats, specifically in NYC.  Few writers would have the guts.>Most professional reviews I read of this book mostly concentrated on the funny facts Sullivan mentions, and this is a great part of the book (learning, for example, that rats have sex twenty times a day).

I always thought of David Wiesner as the Magritte of the children's picture book world.  Now, having read his delightful, \\"The Three Pigs\\", I see that he's far more innovative than I'd suspected.  If this book had been proposed to a book editor, say, twenty years ago it probably would have been discarded as an idea that was \\"too sophisticated\\" for schoolchildren.  I mean, prior to \\"The Three Pigs\\" what other book has ever dared to challenge the notion of the fourth wall?  Mr. Wiesner's delightfully post-modern picture book is possibly one of the most intelligent stories you may ever read to your kids.  And best of all, they'll love it.  Deeply.<br /><br />I think we're all familiar with the story of the three little pigs.  Three pigs build houses of their own.  The first is made of straw, the second of sticks, and the third of bricks.  Then a big bad wolf comes along and blows the first house down.  And that's when things start to get interesting.  Instead of eating the pig (as the text instructs) the wolf is baffled to find the pig gone.  In fact, Pig #1 has inadvertently been blown into the white margins of his own story.  Able now to travel freely around the static pictures of his tale, Pig #1 has his two brothers join him in the margins.  They construct one of the story's pictures into a paper airplane and fly it about.  They walk in and out of other stories, making new friends along the way.  Finally, it's time to return home and the pigs know the perfect way to make their tale have a happy ending.<br /><br />First of all, this is a great way to get kids to question the very basic construction of all stories.  If these pigs can escape their own fate, why not characters in other picture books as well?  Wiesner has cleverly eschewed the idea of having the pigs appearing the same at all times.  When the pigs are in their story they're just your average illustrated pigs.  When they get blown into the margins, however, they become the hyper-realistic pigs you see on the cover of the book.  Then, depending on what the illustration style of any given picture is, they appear as that kind of drawing when they enter it.  For example, a cutesy nursery rhyme makes the pigs appear as adorable roly-poly piggies (a fate they don't particularly take to).  It's fascinating to watch Wiesner make the best possible use of space in this book, especially when you see how beautifully he utilizes pure white backgrounds.  Matrix eat your heart out.<br /><br />Another advantage to reading this delightful book are Wiesner's in-jokes and small details.  If you're familiar with his other Caldecott medal winner, \\"Tuesday\\", then you know that it's about flying frogs.  It should comes as a special delight then when the pigs oh-so casually pass a different book in which fish are flying in a manner mighty similar to the aforementioned story.  Other details in this book include the sly cat with a fiddle who follows the pigs out of his own tale, or the tiny words in a storybook about a knight and his various quests.  There's always something new in \\"The Three Pigs\\" to enjoy and marvel at when you read through the book.  That's partly why it's so good.<br /><br />There are few contemporary illustrator/authors living today that can claim to have more than one Caldecott medal under their belt.  David Wiesner is one of the few.  And \\"The Three Pigs\\" is my favorite Caldecott medal winner, bar none, of the last ten years.  Even if you couldn't care less if your kids are familiar with books that challenge the paradigm of reading itself, you've gotta admit that this is a great story.  A real tour de force.

The notion of paintings that have the ability to come to life is not a new one.  I suspect I'm the only person alive today who remembers a bizarre made-for-tv movie entitled, \\"The Peanut Butter Solution\\", but I assure you that living paintings were integral to the plot.  Similarly, the book, \\"Liang and the Magic Paintbrush\\" by Demi is a Reading Rainbow selection about a boy and his ability to create living creatures simply by drawing them.  Heck, \\"Harold and His Purple Crayon\\" by Crockett Johnson covers similar ground as well!  So I was not initially impressed by the notions behind Jon Agee's, \\"The Incredible Painting of Felix Clousseau\\".  Reading it, however, I found it to be much different from these other drawings-come-to-life plots I'd heard of before.  Above all, it's humorous, something the other books definitely lack.<br /><br />It begins with a contest.  At the Royal Palace of Paris a \\"Contest of Art\\" is held for all the painters in the city.  People come from miles around to display their work, and one of them is Felix Clousseau.  Clousseau presents his painting, a mere slip of a work of a duck, and the judges are embarrassed for him.  When the painting quacks, however, they can't give Felix the top prize fast enough.  Suddenly everyone in the city wants a Clousseau of their very own.  The trouble is, sometimes Felix's paintings cause more damage than good.  With no one to really blame but the painter himself, the owners of the erroneous works of art throw him into prison forthwith.  It is only the timely intervention of a thief and a watchdog artwork that shows people the true advantages of owning Felix's paintings.  Our last shot is of Felix trudging merrily into his studio... and into a painting of a street.  As the book points out, he \\"returned to his painting\\".<br /><br />Originally written in 1988 (the same year as \\"Liang and the Magic Paintbrush\\", but we won't dwell on that fact) the book is a lovely book to look at.  Agee uses beautifully angular black lines to draw everything from affectionate boa constrictors to dapper men in suits.  The colors in this book are muted reds, greens, with a lot of grey and brown around them.  I don't think I'm wrong when I say that the illustrations in this book are simply a joy to look at in and of themselves.  Felix himself is a particularly odd creation.  Wearing a beret, a green suit, and spiffy spats you can make out nothing of his face except his beard, nose, and glasses.  You never see him actually painting anything, which is odd as well, but then you don't really see him doing much of anything at all in this book.  He trudges along with hardly at glance to either side of him.  There's not a lot you can gather from a fellow like Felix Clousseau.  He obviously keeps to himself.<br /><br />In the end, it's a lovely book.  If you have kids that fall in love with it and insist that it be read to them over and over again, you won't cringe at the thought.  When a book is this lovingly thought out, it's a pleasure to peruse.  \\"The Incredibly Painting of Felix Clousseau\\" may tread over familiar ground, but it does so in a way that is particularly of its own devising.  It's hard not to have fun with a book that's so clearly well written.

I mean, it's an incredibly overused sentence.  People who've sat down and watched half an hour of \\"The Jerry Springer Show\\" are as likely to say it as people who've read \\"Les Miserables\\" cover to cover.  I wanted to begin this review of David Klass's fabulous, \\"You Don't Know Me\\" by saying it.  I'm a fairly hard-core book reviewer and I don't laugh OR cry at books easily.  Heck, I can read a Lurlene McDaniels book without cracking so much as a sniffle (not a particularly difficult thing to do, but you get the picture).  But \\"You Don't Know Me\\" is so well written, so funny and sad all at the same time, that it was literally impossible not to laugh AND cry at it all at once.  This is the highest praise I can think to give this book.  I state for the record that this is perhaps one of the greatest young adult novels written in the last ten years.  So sayeth me.<br /><br />You don't know John.  You know absolutely nothing about him.  You don't know what he looks like or how he feels or where he lives or what his life is like.  Soon enough, however, you begin to learn more and more about him.  As it happens, this book takes place from John's mind, a fascinating world of wry sarcasm, dead-pan humor, and ridiculous situations.  John negates his existence by telling you frankly that his home is not a home because of the man who is not his father.  His mother's boyfriend is a violent horrible person that beats John whenever he gets a chance, but does it in such a way that it leaves no visible marks on the fourteen-year-old boy.  At school, John hardly fairs any better.  He is desperately in love with a girl that he has nicknamed Gloria Hallelujah and he attempts in band to play a tuba that is not a tuba.  It is, instead, a giant frog pretending to be a tuba.  John has arrived at this conclusion due to the fact that his tuba does not play music, but rather, croaks.  When John finally gets up the nerve to ask Gloria on a date, his world improves and destructs almost simultaneously.  Within one week everything will change for John and the only question that remains is, will he survive it?<br /><br />Using humor in a YA novel centered on abuse isn't a particularly new concept.  The brilliant \\"Speak\\" by Laurie Halse Anderson uses it well.  But there's a bitterness to \\"Speak\\" that taints it in some way.  The sardonic voice of \\"You Don't Know Me\\" is saying humorous thinks because of the bleakness of his life, true.  On the other hand, you really grow to love John.  He's a fighter.  He will not kill himself or run away from home when his problems become immense because he feels (perhaps rightly) that to do so would be a form of surrender.  I was also impressed that Klass broke the old if-a-gun-appears-in-the-first-act-of-a-play-it'll-be-used-by-the-third-act rule.  That takes guts and not a little sly writing.<br /><br />But again, it's because the book's so funny that it flows effortlessly from scene to scene.  When John passes a note to the girl he loves more than anything else on the planet, he is certain that whatever reaction she has to it will give him some indication of her feelings.  So when she eats it immediately, he is understandably baffled.  It makes for some wonderful writing, especially where John asks his make-believe father what that means and gets a great response.  Klass is adept at displaying John's mother's boyfriend in all his nasty glory as well.  When it snows the man merely looks up to the sky and says \\"sky dandruff\\".  This is a book that's as liable to tread into sweetness and light as it is into gloom and doom.  And through it all you're rooting for John.  You're really cheering for him.  You want him to trust the right people and drop the wrong ones.  You want him to stop living so much in his own head (even though it's a great place for us, the readers, to be).  You want what'sbest for the book's hero, but most of all you just want him to be happy.  And Klass delivers tenfold.<br /><br />So I laughed.  I cried.  It was better than many a young adult novel I've read recently.  Don't let the dreary cover and even drearier title fool you.  \\"You Don't Know Me\\" is writing gold.  It's the sarcastic sardonic answer to every after-school special ever produced.  Maybe what I loved the most about it was that it was so grippingly honest.  Some books don't have the guts to tell you the truth about their characters.  Some books don't have the skill to tell you their story well.  \\"You Don't Know Me\\" has guts, skill, and extraordinary talent within its pages.

Today kids have their Peter Pan animated movies, live action movies, television shows (of which the less said the better), musicals, stage plays, and what have you.  There are a million different versions of the story out there, so it's no wonder the children feel that they don't need to read the original tale.  I myself read it for the first time just now at the ancient age of 26, though I had been warned away from it many times.  I knew about its more peculiar aspects (for example, that whole business involving Mrs. Darling's \\"kiss\\") so these didn't always shock or surprise me.  They just weirded me out from time to time.  What really did catch me unawares though was the wit in the book.  This tale has its peculiarities, no question.  But it also has amazing snatches of excellent writing.  I just wish it had more of the latter and less of the former.<br /><br />As every good schoolchild knows (or is liable to learn from Disney) Peter Pan is the boy who does not age.  Living in Neverland, a kind of ageless fantasy-burg for kids, he is attended by the silly Tinkerbell, a fairy prone to continually shouting, \\"You silly ass\\".  When Peter looses his shadow in the home of the Darling family, he meets Wendy for the first time.  Wendy is entranced by Peter and with the promise of stories he agrees to take her and her brothers Michael and John with him to Neverland.  While there, the kids encounter mermaids, pirates, Indians, and great swashbuckling adventures.  They meet the Lost Boys and come face to face with the dreaded Captain Hook.  But in the end everyone must grow up.  Everyone, that is, but Peter Pan.<br /><br />INTERESTING FACTS THEY NEVER TELL YOU ABOUT THE BOOK \\"PETER PAN\\":<br /><br />1. Smee is declared to be the only Nonconformist in Hook's crew.<br /><br />2. The fairies will occasionally stumble, \\"home from an orgy\\".<br /><br />3. Tinker Bell is prone to wearing a negligee.<br /><br />4. Hook attended private school and is said to bear a resemblance in his manner and dress to Charles II.<br /><br />5. Peter Pan is an awful bore.<br /><br />Readers of \\"Peter Pan\\" have to face up to several indisputable facts when perusing the tale.  First of all, Peter's not that great a guy.  I mean, it's a lot of fun to swoop around fighting bad guys and playing around all the time, but Peter's got a nasty streak about him.  He's conceited and cruel (laughing when Wendy's brothers plunge out of the sky to their near deaths time and time again).  He hates mothers as a rule and even goes so far as to try to trick Wendy into thinking her mother has forgotten her (though he repents at the last minute).  He forgets anyone who loves him and is a combination of the worst aspects of all children.  This isn't to say that his book doesn't make for interesting reading.  I mean, it's not hard to work your way through \\"Peter Pan\\" and it has a lot of rewards.  Barrie has an odd habit of sometimes getting wrapped up in his own peculiar thoughts for a moment before rushing back to the story in a hurry.  The book is thoroughly English, containing such sentences as, \\"children at play are for ever beaching their coracles\\".  Decipherable, but odd.  If it weren't for statements like the ones about Mrs. Darling's kiss (creepy city) it would be an idea book.  To my mind, it could stand a thorough editing job.

Today kids have their Peter Pan animated movies, live action movies, television shows (of which the less said the better), musicals, stage plays, and what have you.  There are a million different versions of the story out there, so it's no wonder the children feel that they don't need to read the original tale.  I myself read it for the first time just now at the ancient age of 26, though I had been warned away from it many times.  I knew about its more peculiar aspects (for example, that whole business involving Mrs. Darling's \\"kiss\\") so these didn't always shock or surprise me.  They just weirded me out from time to time.  What really did catch me unawares though was the wit in the book.  This tale has its peculiarities, no question.  But it also has amazing snatches of excellent writing.  I just wish it had more of the latter and less of the former.<br /><br />As every good schoolchild knows (or is liable to learn from Disney) Peter Pan is the boy who does not age.  Living in Neverland, a kind of ageless fantasy-burg for kids, he is attended by the silly Tinkerbell, a fairy prone to continually shouting, \\"You silly ass\\".  When Peter looses his shadow in the home of the Darling family, he meets Wendy for the first time.  Wendy is entranced by Peter and with the promise of stories he agrees to take her and her brothers Michael and John with him to Neverland.

I mean, it's a lot of fun to swoop around fighting bad guys and playing around all the time, but Peter's got a nasty streak about him.  He's conceited and cruel (laughing when Wendy's brothers plunge out of the sky to their near deaths time and time again).  He hates mothers as a rule and even goes so far as to try to trick Wendy into thinking her mother has forgotten her (though he repents at the last minute).  He forgets anyone who loves him and is a combination of the worst aspects of all children.  This isn't to say that his book doesn't make for interesting reading.  I mean, it's not hard to work your way through \\"Peter Pan\\" and it has a lot of rewards.  Barrie has an odd habit of sometimes getting wrapped up in his own peculiar thoughts for a moment before rushing back to the story in a hurry.

Yet when author Doreen Cronin and her partner in crime illustrator Betsy Lewin wanted to write a coy clever encapsulation of politics for young `uns, they knew they had a character at their fingertips just itching to be used.  Having first appeared in the duo's much loved, \\"Click, Clack, Moo\\", and risen to power in the subsequent, \\"Giggle, Giggle, Quack\\", Duck is a hero for our times.  Now the famous fowl has set his sights on a goal worthy of his stature.  He's running for president.<br /><br />When the book begins Duck is working at Farmer Brown's farm, doing the necessary chores.  But this becomes tedious to Duck and he insists on holding an election.  Farmer Brown is chagrined soon after to find that Duck beat him fair and square.  Duck is pleased with his success, but he soon finds that running a farm is hard work.  Very hard work.  So, without further ado, Duck runs for governor.  Sporting placards that read, \\"I'm a duck, not a politician!\\", he visits small-town diners, marches in parades, and (my favorite line in the book), \\"gave speeches that only other ducks could understand\\".  Duck beats the governor but finds that running a state is, you got it, \\"very hard work\\".  So it's off to run for the presidency.  You see where this is going.  After making it into the White House duck finally finds that he still has to do a lot of work.  A quick searching of the want ads reveal that Farmer Brown is looking for a good duck.  The VP is placed in charge, duck returns to the farm, and the last shot we see of him is as he's writing out his memoirs.<br /><br />This is probably my favorite book out of all the Cronin/Lewin concoctions.  Kids will be amused by duck's antics and the silly ways in which he rises to power.  Adults will be amused by the subtle references made throughout the story to contemporary politics.  Note that on the title page Duck is looking a heckuva lot like Richard Nixon.  Note that his presidential bid comes complete with placards reading, \\"Duck, making us proud again\\".  Kids reading the tale may also notice the difference between campaigning for state governor and president.  Where a person running for the state position walks in parades, and goes to town meetings, a person running for president rides in parades and plays the saxophone on late night television.  I was also amused by author Cronin's choice of words.  Each time Duck ends up doing work he gets covered in all kinds of junk.  As a farmer he's covered in mud, muck, and coffee stains.  As a governor he's covered in fingerprints, mayonnaise, and coffee stains.  And as president he's covered in security badges, Secret Service agents, and coffee stains.  Silly stuff.<br /><br />There are plenty of picture books out there that deal with showing kids how the political process works.  Most of these are dour staid affairs that deal only with the wonders of the president and how \\"he\\" can do nothing wrong.  \\"Duck For President\\" is cannier than that.  Through it, kids can read a satire that will amuse both their parents and themselves.  They can see that sometimes the politicians we elect are not always up for the job.  Using amusing pictures, repetition, and some delightful twists in the plotting, \\"Duck For President\\" is a great great book.  Buy it if you have a sense of humor.  Or want one.ential bid comes complete with placards reading, \\"Duck, making us proud again\\".

512808:US	49148452	R3S3DJMSUSNI82	0399234071	415273855	So You Want to Be President? (CALDECOTT MEDAL BOOK)	Books	4	12	14	N	N	Hail to the chiefs	Books that contain amusing factoids about famous people, whether they be politicians, musicians, actors, or common schlubs like you and me, must be very carefully written.  If penned successfully (as with Kathleen Krull's, \\"Lives of the Musicians\\") these books offer insights into the background and history of the lives of those who've made a difference in the world.  If penned unsuccessfully, they come off as light little slips of books that haven't any weight or substance to them.  \\"So You Want to Be President\\" isn't, perhaps, the weightiest picture book to discuss the office of the Presidency, but it does come off as a fairly successful venture.  I'm not entirely certain that I would have given it a Caldecott Medal in 2001, but it does employ the talents of the fabulous David Small.  For that alone, I salute it.<br /><br />\\"So You Want to Be President\\" begins on an upbeat note. It points out that should you wish to fill the office of the presidency, there are advantages and disadvantages.  Advantages include having your own bowling alley (note Henry Kissinger applauding the successful strike of Richard Nixon), you don't need to take out the garbage, and you get to live in the White House.  The bad things include dressing up all the time, lots of homework, and the occasional thrown cabbage (though I would love to see an attempted cabbage tossing in this day and age).  The book lists the common names of presidents, where they were born, and the winners of the \\"smallest\\" and \\"biggest\\" presidential awards (Madison and Taft respectively).  The book continues in this manner, bringing up every thing from which president had the most brawls (probably nasty old Andrew Jackson) and the usefulness of having someone in the family who was already president.  On the serious side, the book does note that both Nixon and Clinton were impeached for lying under oath (fortunately not mentioning exactly WHY this happened to Clinton).  Oddly, it does not mention that Andrew Johnson was also impeached.  Perhaps it just wanted to pair Clinton with Nixon on a page alone.  It's only when you get to the end of the book that it thinks to mention that if you want to be president it probably helps to be male, white, and Protestant or Roman Catholic.  There's a picture of Jesse Jackson and Geraldine Ferraro standing behind a black velvet rope, not allowed to mingle with the other Presidents.  Interesting.  In the end, the book includes the oath all Presidents must take and it tells you how to be a good President.  The final line in the book is, \\"Most of all, their first priority has always been the people and the country they served\\".  Well.... for most of them, maybe.<br /><br />Actually, I think it's a pretty nice book.  I certainly learned a couple of things I didn't know in it.  If there's any way to make stodgy names like William McKinley and Warren Harding interesting, it's probably through books like this one.  The text is fairly well written, gradually shifting the focus from fun facts to serious ones with a minimum of effort.  It also (I am glad) gives proper credit to FDR's social reforms and JFK's Peace Corps volunteers.  There's an interesting section in the back in which each president is given a one sentence bio, summing up his presidential term.  This, perhaps out of all portions of the book, is the most partisan portion.  A person's individual opinion will influence how he or she reads this section. For example, while I would prefer that the Andrew Jackson section mention his genocidal tendencies towards Native Americans (Trail of Tears, anyone?), the book simply states that he \\"greatly expanded the powers of the presidency\\".  On the other hand, I was pleased to see that Ronald Regan was put down as having, \\"launched the largest peacetime military buildup in American history\\".  Regardless of whether or not you think that was a good thing, it's true.  There's also a nice Bibliography and guide to the people featured in the illustrations ofthe book.<br /><br />But of course, the only reason this book got a Caldecott was because of illustrator David Small.  I mean, let's be honest here people.  Small should have won one years ago, so it's a little disappointing that he received the award for a book that neither he nor his wife Sarah Stewart wrote.  Still, the book's a nice example of his work.  Small began his career as a political cartoonist, and I think that skill has served him nicely in this work.  Each president is recognizable and amusing.  He even has a little black Scottie dog that, if you look carefully, steals one of George Washington's shoes and runs with it to the back of the book.  It is my opinion that without Small this book would be a mildly interesting but unremarkable reference tome hidden away in school libraries across the country.  With his aid, however, it has become so much more than that.<br /><br />Regardless of your politics (unless you believe there shouldn't even BE a President of the United States, of course) this book is bound to go over well.  A bi-partisan offering of presidents over the years, it fills the monumentally difficult task of giving the devils their due.  No one is really left forgotten (with the possible exception of people like Millard Fillmore) and everyone has a say.  Though this book is definitely a love song to a group of white males, of which some of whom are dead, let us hope that books like this in the future will contain people of all races and religions.  If this book can encourage people from all walks of life to aspire to the presidency, it will be doing its job tenfold.ns of the book. <br />  <br />But of course, the only reason this book got a Caldecott was because of illustrator David Small.

Then I picked up \\"The Mennyms\\" by Sylvia Waugh and found that  I had, yet again, rushed to a wrong conclusion.  Written originally in Britain in 1993, the book has been compared to \\"The Borrowers\\" in terms of its storyline and characters.  But where \\"The Borrowers\\" was a tale of tiny people who just wanted to be left alone, the Mennyms are a family of living breathing rag dolls.  I should add, life sized rag dolls.  But lest you start thinking that this is some namby-pamby book in which a bunch of magical dolls have wonderful adventures, allow me to put your mind at ease (or not, depending on what kind of person you are).  This book has more spunk and sizzle than a can of Jolt Cola and reading this book will do anything but bore you.<br /><br />It begins, as so many good novels do, with a letter.  The Mennyms, created by an elderly lady years ago, have been living quite peacefully in their house on Brocklehurst Grove.  Their house has been leased to them from the distant Chesney Loftus and they have quite successfully hidden themselves away from the outside world for roughly 40 years.  Then a letter arrives.  Chesney, it seems, has died.  The house and all its worldly possessions has fallen into the hands of his nephew, a Mr. Albert Pond.  And unlike his uncle, Mr. Pond is very anxious to meet his distant tenants.  Faced with the possibility that they will all soon be discovered, Pond's letter sets off a chain of events.  In time, the Mennyms may have to change some of the solid routines they've been going through for 40 odd years.  Drastically.<br /><br />In spite of being life sized dolls, the Mennym family isn't cutesy in the least.  These dolls bicker, fight, throw tantrums, and occasionally storm out of room in a huff.  They're also loving and tender when it suits them, but don't expect them to be saints.  Trapped in bodies that will never age or die, they have established their family roles brilliantly.  The teens are alternately stubborn or moody as best suits their personalities.  The parents wise or willfully ignorant as suits theirs.  Yet by the end of the book they've not only overcome their own personal prejudices (even ragdolls have a kind of class system in place) but also some long standing grudges.  Good children's books feature characters that grow and change through the course of the action.  \\"The Mennyms\\" isn't afraid of doing that one bit.  More's the better.<br /><br />Not to give anything away, but the surprise twist that pops up in roughly the middle of the book is a doozy.  One I definitely didn't see coming.  I love any kid's book that can throw its adult readers for a loop.  This one  succeeds brilliantly.  Though I figured that teenaged Appleby was up to something, it never occurred to me what exactly that \\"something\\" might be.  Keep your eyes peeled when you read this one.  The clues are all presented there for you.  If you prefer just a good story over a mystery, however, \\"The Mennyms\\" still delivers.  A fun concept and enjoyable book.  I doubt any kid reading it wouldn't want to meet a Mennym of their very own.  An outstanding selection., but don't expect them to be saints.

Similarly, the final book in Lloyd Alexander's Prydain Chronicles won the coveted Newbery Award.  I pity the graduate film and literature students that discover these award winners without having seen/read their predecessors.  Fortunately, \\"The High King\\" doesn't require too much backstory or catching up.  If you are reading this book on its own you'll undoubtedly be annoyed by its continual references to characters or situations you're not personally familiar with.  My advice is not to begin with this, the last in the series.  Find \\"The Book of Three\\" and carry on from there.  \\"The High King\\" is good, but  it's best within context.<br /><br />When we last saw our heroes, Taran and Gurgi were finally returning to Caer Dallben after more than a year of Taran \\"finding himself\\" in the classic sense of the term.  At last they are coming home, and to their delight everyone has turned out for their arrival.  Unfortunately the joy is not for long.  Prince Gwydion has been grievously hurt on his way to the party and his sword of Dyrnwyn has been stolen.  Needless to say, this is very bad news.  Soon the armies of Arawn-Death-Lord are marching and the time for an end to his reign is at hand.  With Taran now a wiser steadier fellow, our band of ragamuffin heroes sets off once more towards adventures, traps, and triumphs.  Old friends are met, new friends are found, and many good stout-hearted people die.  Still, through it all our heroes never give up and the book is a stirring testament to the will of the average joe.  By the end of the book Taran must face his greatest decision yet.  And, as author Lloyd Alexander points out, \\"whether the ending is happy, heartbreaking, or both, readers must decide for themselves\\".<br /><br />Out of all the Prydain books, this is the one that bears the most similarity to the aforementioned \\"Lord of the Rings\\".  This is based on a variety of different factors.  The types of battles waged.  The evil lord's landscaping.  The idea that the bad guy has gotten an object of particular power and can now wield it for evil.  Even the ending is similar (though Taran makes a surprise decision that is the direct opposite of Frodo's own surprise decision).  Don't feel that this book is a weak knock off of Tolkien's (admittedly) better written baby though.  Alexander's at the top of his game here, posing as many philosophical queries as he does political jabs.  The presentation of a former good guy who believes peace can only come by joining up with bad guys... heck we're talking WWII political theory here.  On top of that Taran is at his wisest in this book.  He's poised and confident without being cocky.  There's the odd inclusion of a terribly annoying fellow named Glew in this book who serves only to create important plot points and a form of weak comic relief, but fortunately he is the sole flaw of the book.  I was greatly relieved too.  After the meanderings of Alexander's far weaker, \\"Taran Wanderer\\", I was worried that, \\"The High King\\" might bog down into dreary who-am-I? type speechifying.  Fortunately Eilonwy is present and accounted for in this novel.  She fights and gets captured, but at least she's a gutsy ball of gung-ho goodness.  As the sole female of the novel she's a welcome relief to everyone's serious even toned conversations.  Once again, Eilonwy saves the novel.<br /><br />\\"The High King\\" is far longer than its predecessors, but that's fitting since it's the last in the series.  Alexander keeps the action constant and upbeat.  I doubt you'll find any serious objections to it.  It is sad to say goodbye to the characters we've all grown to know so well in the books.  I've always had a serious crush on Fflewddur Fflam so I think I'll miss him most of all.  Fortunately there's always \\"The Foundling\\" and \\"Coll and His White Pig\\" to read for fun.  They're not officially part of the Prydain canon but they belong squarely in that world.  Consider checking them out if you fall into Lloyd Alexander withdrawal.  \\"The High King\\" is rightfully considered the strongest book in its series.  I recommend it with nary a reservation in sight.nately there's always \\"The Foundling\\" and \\"Coll and His White Pig\\" to read for fun.

For example, when you pick up \\"Joseph Had a Little Overcoat\\", do you understand all the references the book's pictures make?  If not, can you truly say you understand the nature of the book itself?  These were the questions I had to ask myself after reading author Simms Taback's fabulous retelling of the Yiddish folk song, \\"I Had a Little Overcoat\\" (Hob Ich Mir a Mantl).  The book is a crazy conglomeration of mixed media, die-cut pictures, and steady inside jokes for the well informed parent.  Photographs, Hebrew script, and pen & ink abound in this colorful cacophony.  I just wish I was smart enough to get all its jokes and references.<br /><br />The plot, such as it is, is pretty straightforward.  There's Joseph, just an average guy living in a shetl.  When the book begins he has a long overcoat that's grown ratty around its edges.  Quick thinking Joseph turns it into a jacket and goes to a fair.  Then the jacket gets worn so it's quickly converted into a vest for when Joseph dances at his nephew's wedding.  You get the picture.  By the end, Joseph has whittled his former overcoat down to a mere button which he then loses.  Is that the end of it?  Not on your life.  \\"So Joseph made a book about it.  Which shows... you can always make something out of nothing\\".<br /><br />The book uses a clever die-cut technique to give our hero's rapidly shrinking wardrobe a neat page to page continuation.  Therefore, a page with a vest cut into it slips easily over a former picture of Joseph wearing his jacket of the same fabric.  And so on.  The illustrations are in a bright and colorful style, filled to overflowing with reds, greens, blues, and oranges.  The scenes themselves are set in a kind of \\"Fiddler On the Roof\\" setting.  In fact, there are multiple references in the pictures to Sholom Aleichem and his \\"Tevye der Milkhiker\\" (Tevye the Milkman) on which \\"Fiddler\\" was based.  In addition there are references to people like Molly Picon, Mendele Mocher S'forim, and I.L. Peretz.  The book is set up in such a way that a reader can pore over each detail and individual element for long periods of time.  Kids who read it will discover new tiny intricacies that they may have missed in prior readings.  Of course, who knows how many will get the references?  Aside from Sholom Aleichem and a framed print of Sigmund Freud, I was as clueless as they come.  Reading this book, I had the distinct feeling that my knowledge of Jewish history and culture is sorely lacking.  But that's okay.  The important thing is that this book is rife with life, energy, and a style completely of its own.  It's a joy to read.<br /><br />Would I necessarily have given this book the Caldecott Award it eventually received?  Put my answer down as \\"maybe\\".  It's hard to say.  The book itself is interesting and each page an entirely new creation.  I imagine it will not be to everyone's tastes.  Just give it a try when you've a chance.

Having first come in contact with the creation of author Amy Hest and illustrator Jill Barton in the unfortunate, \\"You're the Boss, Baby Duck\\", I wasn't planning on enjoying this companion book in the series.  After all, \\"You're the Boss\\", wasn't really my cup of tea.  Imagine my surprise then when I found \\"Bad Eyeglasses\\" to be fairly good.  Tackling that ancient problem facing children worldwide (getting glasses for the first time), Baby Duck's plight serves to help kids in similar situations as they submit themselves to the indignity of spectacles.<br /><br />Baby Duck is not pleased.  Though her parents attempt to convince her that her new eyeglasses are sweet and useful, she is having none of it.  She does not hop with them for fear of them falling off.  She does not dance with them for fear of them falling off.  She pretty much stays stationary, singing a sad song to herself about the horrid glasses perched on her face.  Fortunately, Grampa is once again to the rescue.  He points out that her shiny red glasses are rather similar to his own.  He encourages her to run around (and the glasses do not fall off).  Finally he gives Baby Duck a little boat of her own, allowing the ecstatic youngster to make up a much happier sounding song at the end of the day.<br /><br />As with all the books in this series, illustrator Jill Barton is at the top of her game.  Whether she's drawing sly looks from Grampa or just including delightful details in her pictures (note the sports page on the cover of the book that Baby's dad is reading), Barton knows what she's doing.  There is a world of difference between a down n' out Baby Duck, and a happily rowing about Baby Duck.  Amy Hest's story is rather nice as well.  Grampa gives good advice and plays with Baby Duck in a wonderful manner.  Of course, there is the fact that Baby Duck's songs never rhyme and rarely scan.  I suppose that's because they're meant to imitate the songs toddlers sing to themselves while young.  Just the same, it makes them a little difficult to sing to your own kids in the context of the story.  Just a thought.<br /><br />On the whole, however, I was pleasantly surprised.  \\"Baby Duck and the Bad Eyeglasses\\" may not be winning any awards in the near future, but it's a sweet story about accepting the inevitable.  With an adept illustrator at the helm and some simple but well written writing, this book is a nice addition to every bespectacled child's library.  Now if only Baby Duck learned how to rhyme...lers sing to themselves while young.  Just the same, it makes them a little difficult to sing to your own kids in the context of the story.

I look forward to the first image on the front endpapers so that I can see what disguise Count Olaf will take next.  I enjoy flipping to the last message from Mr. Snicket, informing us of the name of the next book in the series.  I enjoy the heartbreaking dedications to the author's much loved and lost Beatrice.  And I enjoy the first sentence in the story.  \\"The Carnivorous Carnival\\" (a book I credit with my, now, correct knowledge of how to spell the word \\"carnivorous\\") does not disappoint on any of these counts, though it does offer a few additional surprises.  For one thing, it is the Baudelaire orphans who are disguised on the endpapers in this puppy.  Less surprisingly, they are currently in dire straits.<br /><br />When we last left our heroes, who as I recall were attempting to flee a burning hospital, they had hitched a ride in a car trunk.  A villainous car trunk.  A villainous car trunk belonging to none other than Count Olaf.  Having made it to the Caligari Carnival in this manner, the orphans decide their only possible escape is through disguise.  They snitch some of Olaf's utensils and become old fashioned circus freaks.  Violet and Claus slip into the same clothing to become a two headed person, and Sunny wraps herself in one of Olaf's beards, becoming Chabo the Wolf Baby.  They are hired by the circus's evil Madame Lulu, a woman who's motto in life is, \\"give people what they want\\".  Unfortunately, what people want turns out to be information on the Baudelaires, evil schemes, violence, and sloppy eating.  Taking the book to wild extremes, I can assure you that the Baudelaires find themselves in even WORSE straits at the end of this tale than they did at the beginning.  So the book is, on the whole, a success.<br /><br />Even Snicket himself sort of points out that in two previous book (consecutive to one another even) evil angry mobs hungered for violence to be done to the three kids.  This book is no exception, though it does get a bit old.  And the whole circus freak portion, while handled in an interesting penny-farthing/dime novel fashion is still a little sketchy.  In these politically charged times, it's difficult for any book to use the word \\"freak\\", even if it's as drenched in irony as it is here.  Still, Snicket does an admirable job all things considered.  I doubt very much that this book will shock or disappoint much of anyone.  You do have to feel sorry for the lions in it, though.  Very sorry.<br /><br />On the whole, the book is yet another change in the \\"Series of Unfortunate Events\\".  Not only do the books leave the orphans in exciting dangerous situations at the end of each tale, but they also change the role the Baudelaires have had.  Now THEY are disguising themselves in order to find out what they need to know.  My great hope is that at some point in the story, Lemony Snicket himself will finally catch up with the kids and meet them for the very first time.  Sadly, that has not happened quite yet.  But with four more books in the series to go after this one, it's something to look forward to.

515644:US	49148452	R264N8LQ8IUJ2A	014036336X	315622119	The House with a Clock in Its Walls (Lewis Barnavelt)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	You can ring my bell.  Ring my bell.	Some of the best children's books out there today deal with the mysterious nature of walls.  Walls are an essential element to any house, and therefore they're privy to all kinds of secrets.  In \\"The Woman In the Walls\\" by Patrice Kindl a girl lives within the walls of her own house to escape from prying eyes.  In \\"The Wolves in the Walls\\" by Neal Gaiman, walls turn out to contain fearsome violent snaggle toothed beasties.  But I think that the book that best captures the fear that something horrible is lurking inside your otherwise safe and cozy home is the delightfully gothic, \\"The House With a Clock In Its Walls\\" by John Bellairs.<br /><br />Lewis is perhaps the most unlikely hero you could hope for.  He's pudgy and shy.  He likes to study old battles and he can't swing a baseball bat to save his life.  Unfortunately for Lewis his parents have recently died in a car crash and he has been sent to live with his hitherto unknown Uncle Jonathan.  To Lewis's relief, however, Uncle Jonathan is a wonderful fellow, as is his neighbor Mrs. Zimmermann.  Before you know it, Lewis has discovered that the two old friends are wizards as well and that the house in which Jonathan and Lewis live once belonged to warlock of evil leanings.  Lewis isn't particularly upset by all this until a Halloween spell he casts goes horribly awry and it appears that Lewis has released a particularly nasty power.  And then there's that clock in Lewis's house that can be heard ticking in every room.  But what's it ticking for?  Lewis learns soon enough that the clock in the walls not the kind of thing you'd want to hear chime.  It could easily be the last thing you ever heard.<br /><br />The brilliant hiring of Edward Gorey as the illustrator of this book is to be commended.  Bravo!  Well done!  With its dark undercurrents and creepy goings ons, Gorey adds just the right touch to this already spooky affair.  This isn't to say that the book isn't amusing as well.  Jonathan and Mrs. Zimmermann have a delightful patter of insults between one another that's as natural and cheery as can be.  He calls her \\"Frumpy\\" and she calls him \\"Weird Beard\\".  Characters in this story (the good ones anyway) are apt to eat a lot of delicious chocolate-chip cookies while proclaiming loudly, \\"Poop, it would!\\" when denying something.  You can't help but love the two wizards, and Lewis grows on the reader as well.  He isn't particularly brave or attractive as a hero.  He doesn't have Harry Potter's driving sensibilities or the jauntiness of a Peter Pan.  He's just your average joe, trying not to draw too much attention to himself while hoping desperately for a friend.  Fortunately author John Bellairs never makes Lewis too pitiful, so you end up rooting for him at the end rather than feeling sorry for the little cuss.  I was also amused at how different this type of boy-messes-with-powers-over-which-he-has-no-control-and-things-go-horribly-wrong book this was.  If you look at \\"The Wizard of Earthsea\\" or \\"The Amulet of Samarkand\\" both these books contain cocky boys who think they can handle the dark forces they unleash.  As for Lewis, he hasn't got a clue, poor ducky.  He's just doing it to hold onto his only pal.  At least his intentions are pure.<br /><br />Gothic children's books like this one are all the rage these days.  I am thinking, of course, of \\"The Series of Unfortunate Events\\" and all that that entails.  If you happen to have a kid that likes the creepy dark nature of antiques and wild spells, \\"The House With the Clock in Its Walls\\" is definitely for them.  I wouldn't recommend giving this book to any kid with parents that find books like \\"Harry Potter\\" to be evil, though.  I mean, this book actually has a bit of necromancy in it.  So keep that in mind.  Otherwise, it's great for all those children who enjoy magic, mystery, and Victorian style mansions.

I mean, let's look at it soberly.  They come into a country in the Middle East, take over huge swaths of it, claim it as their own, are shocked when the residents of the area don't like being oppressed, then set about hacking their way back in only to fail in the end.  Just a scant overview of their actions is enough to make them look vaguely ridiculous.  Once you start learning a little more about their actions (or rather, the actions of their leaders) you see just how violent and, not to put too fine a point on it, evil they were.  Therefore, it's a bit surprising that a popular kid's book about Saladin hasn't been written before now.  At this moment in time, circumstances have given kids a chance to learn more about the followers of Islam and their history.  It seems fitting, then, that we should look at one of their greatest heroes and grant him the respect he's due.  \\"Saladin: Noble Prince of Islam\\" does just that.<br /><br />Saladin was born along the Tigris River well after Jerusalem fell into the hands of the marauding Crusaders from England.  As a child, he attended to his studies well and learned the tenants of Islam by heart.  All this gave him the understanding he required to be a good and righteous man amongst his people.  As a teen Saladin became the chief aide of the Turkish sultan Nur al-Din, a fair leader who earned the respect of his subjects.  From him Saladin found his role model and guide.  After Nur al-Din's death, he staked his claim on the man's empire and brought together his warring brothers.  This allowed him the army he needed to set out to defeat the Franks and to reclaim Jerusalem once more.  To do this he faced Reginald of Chatillon, \\"perhaps the greatest villain in the history of the Crusade\\" (which is saying quite a lot), Richard the Lionhearted, and other adversaries.  The book recounts a myriad of battles undertaken by both the Crusaders and the Muslims.  Both sides had their wins and losses.  In the end, however, Saladin was victorious and in 1291 (years after his death), \\"the Franks were driven out of the Holy Land altogether\\".  So well done there.<br /><br />Though it doesn't look it, this book is an excellent reference for any kid interested in battles and battle strategy.  It summarizes the greatest confrontations of both sides and makes them understandable and interesting.  There is also no question at any time as to who the heroes are.  The Franks (to the Muslims all Crusaders were regarded as \\"Franks\\") break treaties, lie, kill for pleasure, and remain the greediest of no-goodniks.  Saladin would often spare his captured enemies or give them a chance to pay a price to avoid being sold as slaves.  King Richard, on the other hand, was prone to slaughtering three thousand Muslim men when he captured them.  A cruel barbarian, he met a violent death, as was his due.  Saladin died in his bed, having ended his life to his own liking.  Touche.<br /><br />I suspect that there are people out there who can't imagine a man like Saladin being far more generous and compassionate than a man like Richard.  To back up her information, therefore, author Diane Stanley has included an excellent Bibliography for further reading.  Terms that might not be readily recognizable to readers are included in a Glossary in the back.  Accompanying the text itself are beautiful glossy illustrations that perfectly compliment the book's plot and storyline.  All this and the book is respectful to the people of the Islam faith.<br /><br />Biographies of historical figures well known in their native lands but little known in American schools are difficult to create.  With that in mind, Stanley has done a remarkable job.  She even ties in the events of the book to the modern day, commenting that, \\"Two hundred years of Frankish invasion, senseless slaughter, and religious fanaticism left a tragic legacy.  A shadow of hatred and mistrust had fallen over this great land, holy to three faiths.  A thousand years later, it is still there\\".  And not likely to leave soon.  Let us hope then that beautifully written biographies like \\"Saladin\\" dispel the myths that remain about the man, his life, and his religion.  This book should be in every school library in America.ghter, and religious fanaticism left a tragic legacy.  A shadow of hatred and mistrust had fallen over this great land, holy to three faiths.

Blessed be the non-fiction picture books of the world that deal with obscure and unknown heroes with regularity, for they shall be the award winners in the end.  I suspect that Jacqueline Briggs Martin's Caldecott Award winning book, \\"Snowflake Bentley\\" is perhaps how most people today have come to learn about Wilson Bentley and his lifelong habits and dreams.  In my own personal experience, I never ran across Bentley's name (to the best of my knowledge) until I read this sweet story.  To my mind, it is deserving of its praise.<br /><br />Author Jacqueline Briggs Martin is not above beginning her tale with a particularly evocative and intriguing sentence like, \\"In the days when farmers worked with ox and sled and cut the dark with lantern light, there lived a boy who loved snow more than anything else in the world\\".  Meet Wilson Bentley.  Your typical farm boy with atypical aspirations.  Willie loved catching snowflakes with the hopes of preserving them for others to see.  Unfortunately, he couldn't find a way of keeping track of them.  Drawing them didn't work because the snow crystals would melt before he finished sketching them out.  Then, at the age of seventeen he saw a camera with its own microscope for sale.  Winning the award for \\"Best Parents Ever\\", Willie's ma and pa used their savings to buy their teenaged son the camera he always wanted.  As the book says it, \\"cost as much as his father's herd of ten cows\\".  After more than a year of attempts and failures, Willie finally managed to photograph a snowflake successfully.  Time passed and Willie perfected his technique.  He didn't limit himself to winter beauty, however.  Mr. Bentley also photographed spider webs and grasshoppers covered in dew, amongst other things.  Eventually, the scientific community began to sit up and take notice and at the age of sixty-six a book was made of Willie's best photographs.  After his death a museum was created in his honor.  The last page of the book shows a photo of the actual Snowflake Bentley and some of his snowflake photographs.  Looking at them, it doesn't seem surprising at all that someone would want to dedicate their life to preserving such amazing works of nature.  It seems inspired.<br /><br />When I first read the book, I wished that it had contained more photographs and less illustrations.  This is not to degrade the work of the talented Mary Azarian.  I just wanted to see more examples of the great man's work.  The three at the back of the book whet my appetite but did not satiate it.  Looking at the book a second time, however, I see that this failing to illustrate it would have been a mistake.  Azarian's woodcuts fit the tone of the book beautifully.  Presented alongside hand tinted watercolors, they display the harsh winter months of Vermont as well as the family relationships in Bentley's life.  Azarian has also managed to convey action and energy in her photographs.  Bentley, when he first successfully photographs a snowflake, emerges from his winter hut leaping ecstatically on one leg.  Kids throw snowballs at one another amidst the falling flakes and horses trot along the roads easily.  And all this is merely background to Bentley's accomplishments.<br /><br />The story itself is expertly presented as well.  Author Martin has carefully whittled down Bentley's life so that we only see those parts of it that best apply to his tale.  There isn't a drop of excess or needless information here.  Everything is presented factually with scant references into what our hero \\"thought\\" or \\"dreamed\\".  To my delight, Martin even presents her sources on Bentley's life.  If you happen to have a 1923 National Geographic sitting in your basement (and trust me, some people do), you might want to look up Bentley's article there.  Finally, Martin includes factoids on the sides of her pages, keeping them distinct from the illustrations but close enough that you can glance over to them for additional information.<br /><br />Kids in school always have to pick someone to write a biography on.  Usually these are great grand historical figures that cut their way into American textbooks everywhere.  But if your child wants to write about someone a little less known (though, in his way, I would argue that he is no less important) that dealt with both science and art all at once, Snowflake Bentley is your man.  The great farmer-scientist finally has a book singing his praise./>Kids in school always have to pick someone to write a biography on.

517984:US	49148452	R2ONWP4NUHZWAG	014031010X	220090506	Rabbit Hill	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Saw a rabbit hopping there, knocking on my door	The wide range of Newbery Award winning books never ceases to amaze me.  Having finished the intense and revolutionary (ho ho) \\"Johnny Tremain\\" I moved onto the next winner in line.  This turned out to be \\"Rabbit Hill\\" by the incomparable Robert Lawson.  Having already garnered an award for the Newbery winning \\"Adam of the Road\\", (a book he did not write himself) as well as a Caldecott for the misguided, \\"They Were Strong and Good\\", Lawson finally goes whole hog and gets a Newbery for a book he both wrote AND illustrated.  \\"Rabbit Hill\\" is a charming little tale about a group of small animals of the wild and the farmland they love.<br /><br />As the book opens, things have been going poorly for the little animals living by a deserted farmland.  The house has been empty for years, letting the fields and gardens go to pot in the meantime.  Without a steady supply of food, animals are leaving their homes in the hopes of doing better elsewhere.  Suddenly gossip begins, suggesting that perhaps the house will be occupied by a new family soon.  The chant of \\"New Folks coming\\" is taken up by everyone from the fieldmice to the gray fox to our hero Little Georgie the rabbit.  Little Georgie is particularly boisterous in his joy, going so far as to fetch his family's Great Uncle Analdus in the hopes that soon there will be plenty of food for all.  When the family moving into the house arrives everything seems to be perfect.  That is, until a tragic night involving Little Georgie, a dark road, and an oncoming vehicle.<br /><br />The book seems to have a bit of difficulty figuring out how to characterize the animals in it.  On the one hand they're just like any woodland creatures you might find.  They rely on storing food for the winter months ahead.  They understand the dangers inherent in poisons, cars, traps, dogs, cats, etc.  They live in the woods and have the kinds of concerns any animal might have.  On the other hand, they seem to own a lot of household equipment (rakes, lunch sacks, rocking chairs, framed prints, etc.).  They speak regularly, sometimes to humans.  There's even some mention of Willie the Fieldmouse easing his belt a hole or two after copious eating (though the accompanying illustrations make it very clear that the animals do not wear clothing).  All in all, this book belongs squarely in the world of Beatrix Potter, more than anything else.  It's an odd nebulous world where animals have distinctly human characteristics, yet their relationships to humans and predators remain intact.<br /><br />As for the story itself, it's very sweet and simple.  I don't think you'll find yourself especially blown away by anything it has to say.  It doesn't, for example, have the sly wit of \\"Wind in the Willows\\" or the political bent of books like, \\"Watership Down\\".  The story does say one or two good things about prejudice and hatred, but only briefly and at the end.  There's also an oblique reference to World War II (the book was originally published in 1944) but that's as trapped in time as it gets.  Instead, the book has a timeless quality to it.  Should you wish to read it to your kids, I recommend pairing it with the more recent and delightful \\"Poppy\\" by Avi.  The two would go particularly well together, I think.<br /><br />\\"Rabbit Hill\\" may not strike some as particularly important, but I am certain that there are millions of adults out there with fond memories of Little Georgie's Southern gentleman father (prone to sentences that includes phrases like, \\"That is precisely the subject on which I wished to consult you\\"), his curmudgeonly uncle (who avoids kohl-rabi because he doesn't hold with \\"foreign vittles\\"), and his perpetually worried mama.  The book has a simple lighthearted charm that I'm certain will engross children even today.  For some great bedtime reading involving fluffy characters (drawn, I needn't add, expertly by Lawson's steady hand), \\"Rabbit Hill\\"'s a good pick.  Fun and frolicsome.

Please don't misunderstand this statement.  Having read this book on my own I've found it to be infinitely interesting, deep, and touching.  Author Suzanne Fisher Staples has written a book that every kid should WANT to read.  The problem is, if a child does not want to read it, this book must be incredibly painful to get through.  At its best \\"Shabanu\\" conjures up a world that few Americans have ever witnessed firsthand.  If you think you know an adolescent that could understand \\"Shabanu\\"'s understated beauty, definitely consider buying it for them.  But please don't make this book required reading.  Forcing people to read this tale is the perfect way to make it widely despised.<br /><br />In the Cholistan Desert of Pakistan lives a family of desert dwellers.  Daughters Phulan and Shabanu attend their family's camels alongside their father, mother, grandfather, aunt, and young male cousins.  Life in the desert can be difficult, but Shabanu wouldn't have it any other way.  She loves tending the camels alongside her father.  With her older sister's impending marriage coming up, Shabanu knows that soon her little family will be torn apart.  Most of the book concentrates on what it means to live in the Cholistan, often at the mercy of the duststorms and monsoons that help or hurt the region.  It isn't until page 191 that the real drama of the book comes into play.  When a tragedy hurts Phulan's potential husband, it's up to Shabanu to sacrifice herself for the good of the family.  The question becomes, will she do it?<br /><br />First of all, in spite of its Newbery Honor Award, this book probably should have received a Printz Award instead for young adult literature.  Unless the kids that read through this puppy understand what rape and sex are, they're going to get a little confused with the plot.  Best to recommend this book to those kids from sixth grade onwards.  I was a little amazed by how gutsy author Staples was with this small novel.  This isn't \\"Catherine Called Birdy\\", though at first glance the plots may seem similar.  For Shabanu, her choices in life are severely limited.  But Staples isn't pointing to the people who perpetuate child marriages and limited female freedoms crying, \\"Evil!\\".  This is a balanced portrait of a culture entirely unlike our own, yet with significant similarities.  What's so impressive is that Staples is able to give us a greater understanding of Shabanu's world.  It comes to the point where you realize that Shabanu's fury at her position in life is impossible to shift from.<br /><br />But as I was saying before, never ever assign this book in a classroom.  Some children's books are custom made for class discussions.  \\"Holes\\" by Louis Sacher, for instance.  \\"Shabanu\\" is incredibly well written and thought out.  But all the beauty of the text is completely reliant on the reader's willing participation.  If a kid is forced to read this book they're going to be bored.  They'll think the book is slow moving and not exciting in the least.  This is not necessarily the case, if you stick with it.  Still, I urge you to assign it only to those kids who are comfortable reading books that are filled with descriptions and long passages without dialogue.  \\"Shabanu\\" is a beautiful piece of work.

This tends to happen when I reread Tasha Tudor's incredible, \\"A Time to Keep\\", or the little known, \\"Minnikin, Midgie, and Moppet\\" by Adelaide Holl.  I haven't felt that way for a while.  That is, until I picked up Charlotte Zolotow's unassuming \\"I Can Read Book\\" entitled, \\"Seasons: A Books of Poems\\".  Containing forty poems that hinge around the changing seasons as well as the day to day goings on of children, the book's amazing.  The poems rich and evocative.  The illustrations magical.  If you know any children at all, please buy them this book.  Please.<br /><br />I don't know the history behind this collection of poems, so there's not much I can really tell you about it.  As far as I can determine, it was first published in 2002.  The illustrations initially strike you as old fashioned.  Lots of country scenes mixed with the occasional cityscape.  Then you notice that the kids are wearing contemporary clothing.  A child and her mother sport trendy bike helmets as they observe birds flying in formation.  Erik Blegvad is the illustrator of this book, and I'm ashamed to say that I don't know a thing about him.  Certainly the pictures are particularly Tasha Tudoresque.  But unlike Tudor they're pictures that contain very particular moods and emotions.  There is a safe world in these illustrations where children are free to run around in fields of golden fallen leaves and have parents and grandparents to play and listen with them.  When you read this book to your kids (or they read it to you) it'll create all kinds of wonderful feelings within the child.  The watercolors used with these pen and ink pictures display lighting excellently.  From the gray skied dawn of a winter morning to the pink summer setting of the sun along a boggy pond.<br /><br />Matching these illustrations word for word are Zolotow's poems.  A premiere children's author in her own right (check out \\"William's Doll\\" if you get a chance), I think I'll copy down one of the book's forty poems to give you a sense of her style.  This is entitled The Crickets:  \\"The crickets fill the night with their voices - It is like a message in another language spoken to a part of me who hasn't happened yet\\".  These are poems about the pains and the joys of being young.  It's as if Zolotow hasn't forgotten what it was once like.  For all her age and experience, she's tapped perfectly into the experience of seeing the world with fresh new eyes.<br /><br />Your child should own books that stay with them the rest of their lives.  When you give a child specific stories to hold on to, you give them wonderful memories and fantastic new ways of seeing the world.  Charlotte Zolotow's, \\"Seasons: A Book of Poems\\", will be the book I give to every small child that crosses my path from now on.  It is infinitely beautiful and incredibly well written.

Though she's been criticized as being yet another New York based picture book character that only the trendiest of parents enjoy, I really loved both \\"Olivia\\" and its sequel \\"Olivia Saves the Circus\\".  Both books show an imaginative gutsy heroine with just the right combination of verve and oomph.  Unfortunately, it appears that success has gone to Olivia's piggy little head.  In her third offering, \\"Olivia...and the Missing Toy\\", she's gone from whimsically precocious to spoiled, demanding, and greedy.  This is not the Olivia I grew to love.  This is not the Olivia I want to read about.<br /><br />In \\"The Missing Toy\\", Olivia is not happy.  Her soccer uniform comes, \\"in a really unattractive green\\".  Never mind that the particular shade of the uniform is the same green that appears throughout the story in toys, books, and sofas.  She insists that her mother make her, by hand, a new red soccer uniform so that she'll stand out.  Ignoring the question of, \\"what kind of mother makes a new soccer uniform for her child just because the kid wants it?\\", her mom does but instead of a thank you Olivia demands to know the current location of her favorite toy.  It was near her very recently and now it has left.  After interrogating all available brothers and searching the house, Olivia discovers the furry culprit with a very chewed up toy.  She wails a little in the presence of her parents and her father promises her a new toy the next day.  Hugging him Olivia proclaims that, \\"I love you more than anyone\\" (to the frowning still unthanked disapproval of her mother).  You might expect that at this point Olivia would then turn to her mother and thank her for making her such a nice new uniform.  Maybe she'd be apologetic for failing to do so earlier and ask, very politely this time, if her mother would sew up her toy.  Not so much.  One of the last shots we have of Olivia is her carrying four large books for bed demanding, \\"Only books about cats tonight, Mommy\\".<br /><br />It looks as if Falconer has attempted to make his little heroine charmingly individual in her tastes and styles.  Instead, it's comes off as a story about a spoiled kid who gets what she wants (even when it's a bad idea) and wins in the end.  The illustrations are, as always, beautiful.  It's the story that needs work.  A LOT of work.  It's all well and good to want to be unique.  But if you're on a team, particularly a sport-like team, you should learn how to help others and work with them.  Olivia doesn't seem particularly interested in anyone but herself and getting what she wants (like new toys from her somewhat absent but free with the cash father).  That's the moral of the story as I read it, anyway.<br /><br />Having defended \\"Olivia\\" to a vast number of people, it's seems a pity that this third book should disappoint me like this.  If Falconer is planning on any additional Olivia-like outings in the future, he should probably avoid making his heroine so self-absorbed.  I'm a fan of what Olivia is capable of.

Today he has produced countless picture books, middle reader books, and young adult books for masses of children everywhere.  He's won Newbery Honors, a Newbery Award, and copious amounts of praise and veneration.  And to think it all started with a little early reader book called \\"No More Magic\\".  Originally written in 1975, the book has all the spunk and catchy writing you'd expect in an Avi creation.  It won a Special Award from the Mystery Writers of America when it was first published and remains a beloved book by many to this day.  If you've a kid who loves mystery books but has tired of Cam Jansen, Encyclopedia Brown, or Chet Gecko and wants to try something a little different, \\"No More Magic\\" may be right up their alley.<br /><br />It all begins with a bike.  Chris's bike.  Which is to say, the disappearance of Chris's bike.  A special kind of creation, Chris bought the green colored contraption from a nearby junk yard once and has loved it ever since.  Unfortunately, it appears that he left it out on Halloween night and it has somehow disappeared.  His father, a librarian, advises Chris to, \\"get the questions right before you get the answers wrong\\".  So begins Chris's attempts to solve a particularly engrossing mystery.  Before he knows it he's tracking down a warlock, befriending a girl in a Druid coat, accusing his best friend of involvement, and seeing his bike fly high past the moon.  Though his parents are telling him there's no such thing as magic, Chris is setting out to prove them wrong.  And to get his bike back too.<br /><br />Though originally written in 1975, the book has held up exceedingly well.  This might be partly because so much of what it has to say has remained so timeless.  With the resurgence of interest in super heroes, even the sections talking about Batman and the Green Lantern still work (or they do if your child watches the Cartoon Network's new \\"Justice League\\" show).  The only datable elements that remain are prices.  A new bike, we are informed, usually costs $20.  And no one, I guess, wears a helmet while riding one.  Yet beyond that, the book is as fresh as a daisy.  The characters are realistic and interesting.  The mystery fresh and fascinating.  Avi has set himself up with the monumentally difficult task of making the book realistic to both kids that do believe in magic and kids who don't.  If your child wants to believe that something supernatural is behind the mysteries presented in \\"No More Magic\\", it's not a problem.  If, on the other hand, they don't, it's also not a problem.  This book may well be the perfect answer to those parents that disapprove of magic in children's books, yet have children who yearn to read about other realities.  It could satisfy them both.<br /><br />The book's an early reader, best for those kids that have started chapter books and want something on the level with \\"Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing\\".  I think they'll like it.  It's a fabulous autumnal book as well, so definitely consider recommending it around Halloween time.  Though it was the first thing he wrote, Avi knew what he was doing with \\"No More Magic\\" right from the start.  An inauspicious debut by a now well known and well respected writer.

519405:US	49148452	R1OKJQZ7VZ54Q6	0142300497	970205370	Island of the Aunts	Books	4	1	1	N	N	It's like "Raising Arizona", but with Aunts.	It is terribly unfair to compare any author living and working today to the late great Roald Dahl.  Nonetheless, you hear it all the time.  \\"Oh, J.K. Rowling writes about candy as well as Roald Dahl\\".  \\"Oh, Lemony Snicket has the same dark streak as Roald Dahl\\".  \\"Oh, Roald Dahl's later works are almost as good as Roald Dah's early ones\\".  You get the picture.  Then along comes Eva Ibbotson.  Eva isn't asking you to consider her the next Dahl.  Eva just wants you to read her books and enjoy them.  And if they happen to bear some slight Dahlish qualities (horrid beastly children, large odd creatures of magnificent size, and adults of peculiar natures) that's not her fault.  A good writer comes up with original eclectic characters and situations.  And Eva Ibbotson fits that description to a tee.<br /><br />The book begins with 3 kidnappings.  Not your usual snatch-a-kid-and-hold-them-for-ransom kidnappings.  No, these are kidnappings in which both the children and the adults are (initially at least) unwilling participants.  You see, on a great mysterious island far far in the ocean live three aunts and their ancient father.  The women care for a vast assortment of creatures of which some are normal, some are odd, and some are very very odd.  The aunts have noticed that they're growing old, though.  With no children of their own they know they need some healthy youngsters to carry on when they are gone.  That's where the kidnapping part comes in.  Oh sure, the aunts know that kidnapping is deeply amoral.  But so is the potential plight their creatures might face without some human protection.  In a jiffy the three have snatched a child apiece.  Two are perfect for the task at hand.  As for the third, he wreaks a terrible havoc on the island that no one could have predicted.<br /><br />There were a lot of things I liked about this book.  I liked Ibbotson's writing style.  Her plot is easy to follow and constantly interesting.  She isn't interested in bogging the reader down with long dreary descriptions or nauseatingly dull passages.  Instead, everything is spiffy and quick.  Characters are infinitely understandable and multi-layered the minute she writes about them.  I was particularly amused by the characters of the aunts.  Though not attractive in the traditional sense of the word, and well past their prime (in the olden days they would have been referred to as crones), they still command a great deal of respect from the reader.  How many children's books can you name where a group of middle aged women are the heroes of the tale?  I suspect, not many.  The two children that fit in well on the island, Minette and Fabio, are good kids that don't annoy you.  And the children that aren't good kids (the spoiled Lambert and the impossible Boo-Boo and the Little One) are horrid in all the best possible ways.  Who isn't going to instantly dislike a child that insists that its shoes be given a coat of tan polish?  \\"It's got to be tan, not brown\\".  I loved that Ibbotson was able to show children with similar backgrounds but grossly different personalities.  Though both Lambert and Fabio are from rich families, one boy is obviously a good kid and the odd a disgusting little louse.<br /><br />Then there's the fact that Ibbotson doesn't rely on the usual fantastical creatures in her book.  Oh sure, there are mermaids and ghosts n' stuff.  But there are also selkies, boobries, kraken, stoorworms, and even the occasional naak.  I loved how she incorporated such an amazing variety of animalia into her tale.  Finally, a tip of the hat to Ibbotson's storytelling technique.  When things get bleak in this puppy they get very bleak indeed.  I warn you... if you're not prepared to read the last eight chapters in one sitting you may regret it quite a lot.  Cause once the troubles start coming, you're going to feel obligated to follow them through till the happy ending.<br /><br />The illustrations by Kevin Hawkes add just the right touch to the tale.I hadn't even really realized that there would be illustrations to this book until I came to the picture of Aunt Etta staring with unusual intensity at a small and somewhat wary Minette.  Really, it's the pictures that make this book as good as it is.  All I ask is that you turn to page 102 of the book and look at the picture there.  If you find (after having read up to this point) that you can look at this illustration and NOT guffaw, then find yourself a sense of humor and purchase it immediately.  The picture's the funniest thing I may ever see in a kid's book.<br /><br />And I haven't even begun to gush about the use of nudists in the text (fabulously done), or the logic of mermaids luring Arabian oil ships onto rocks (they were hoping for treasure), or the great horrid parents found in the text, or the kraken, or.... Ah well.  That's the problem with reviews that are limited to 1000 words, I guess.  Take my advice and read yourself a little of this book.  It definitely will ever-so-briefly satiate kids that yearn for the magic and mystery usually found in a Harry Potter creation.  Moreover, it will amuse and delight every person of every age.  It's a fine fine book.uch to the tale.

Harvey (Boston Globe-Horn Book Awards (Awards))	Books	2	22	50	N	N	A happy-go-lucky tale of September 11	So you're walking around the children's section of the library with your child and on a desk or a table or the floor your kid sees a picture book called, \\"Fireboat: The Heroic Adventures of the John J. Harvey\\".  On the cover is a picture of a perky little fireboat spurting water hither and yon.  It's a charming little image and without flipping through it (or perhaps just the first few pages) you pick it up and check it out.  Later, you're reading it to your toddler when, to your surprise, there's a mention of September 11th.  Turning the next page you see two planes flying side by side into the Twin Towers.  Turn another page and the towers have exploded.  Gouache fire, smoke, falling debris, and what could possibly be blood cascade from the sky.  Now totally apart from the fact that two planes did not, in fact, fly into the Twin Towers at the same time, what on earth is this doing in a children's book at this time?  Who's bright idea was that?  And what in the world is this story about?<br /><br />Well, you've just stumbled across Maira Kalman's answer to the tragedy of 9-11.  \\"Fireboat\\", in its own somewhat mistaken way, is the tale of the little ship that could.  Based on a true story, the book begins with a slapdash encapsulation of New York City, the way it was in 1931.  The Empire State Building was built, Babe Ruth hit his 611th home run, Snickers the candy bar was made (if this was a movie I'd wonder if the Mars company got a payment of some sort for this gratuitous product placement), and a fireboat was born.  The John J. Harvey was great but in 1995 it was retired.  Fortunately a group of philanthropists decided to purchase the run down boat and make it as good as new.  They did so and not a minute too soon.  When the Twin Towers fell the water pipes needed by the firemen were broken down and buried.  It was up to the John J. Harvey to put out the nasty fires and save the day.  And now, \\"The Harvey is back to being a very happy boat\\".  The end!<br /><br />Entirely aside from whether or not it's appropriate to draw such a gratuitous depiction of the Towers falling at this moment in time (and baby, gratuitous doesn't even begin to explain the half of it) let's look at the book as a whole.  There's a really weird thing going on in this story.  First of all, author Kalman doesn't seem to be entirely certain what kind of tale she wants to tell.  Obviously she wants to honor the owners of the Harvey as well as the actions of others on that tragic day.  To do so, however, she's chosen an oddly cutesy method.  Her explanations of 1931 include this tidbit: \\"On a hot and jazzy night the word HOT-CHA was invented\\".  Then she shows how Harvey went along its merry way putting out fires in the piers where items sold included, \\"wood and cotton and bananas and bubble gum and EVERYTHING\\".  Short of putting a face on Harvey (which this reviewer is mighty glad she abstained from) it's hard to make the elements of this tale any cuter.  Then out of nowhere she draws two planes crashing into the towers, a mere page or two after the phrase, \\"A boat says hello with four toots\\".  Talk about switching gears.  The image of the Harvey fighting the fires of the burning towers may have calm semi-comforting words, but the page depicts gigantic burning fire enwrapped shells of buildings.  It is, quite frankly, a terrifying image.  And then... AND THEN the book ends (I kid you not) with this sentence: \\"The friends of the Harvey have found a little tugboat to adopt.  Doesn't everyone need a tugboat?\\"  Well gol durn.  If terrorists blow up a cruise ship sailing out of the Chelsea piers I can guess what the next oh-so-adorable book will center on.<br /><br />Look.  I'm not saying that good picture books about September 11th can't be done.  They're just very difficult to manage.  They take a certain amount of skill and dexterity.  Observe the subtle and brilliant 2004 Caldecott winner, \\"The Man Who Walked Between the Towers\\" by Mordecai Gerstein.  It acknowledges the loss without including poorly thought out two page spreads of planes tearing into buildings.  Kalman's book lacks tact.  I think her intentions were pure with this book, but in the end the story is frightening and badly written.  If you want to introduce your children to the events of that day, do so slowly with Gerstein.  If you want to scare them with a falsely cheery boat tale, do so with Kalman's.tein.

Honest.  After poring through the heaps of badly sketched and horribly plotted books that glut much of the marketplace, this may not seem to be the case.  Then you read something like \\"Tithe\\".  I consider myself somewhat of an expert on children and teen books that deal with fairies and fairy kin.  After reading \\"Tithe\\" I think I've finally met the best of the best.<br /><br />Kaye's life sucks.  Her mom's a perpetually drunk rocker who's forever losing gigs and who shuttles her sixteen-year-old daughter from town to town constantly.  After a run in with her mother's seemingly violent boyfriend, Kaye and her mum settle down with Kaye's grandmother in New Jersey.  It was here that Kaye grew up until six years ago.  Here that she would encounter fairies and their kin when a child.  But now Kaye's grown up a lot and the fairies don't seem to be showing.  That is, until she discovers and saves the life of a darkly handsome knight, wounded by an iron arrow.  Suddenly Kaye discovers who she is and the price she must pay to secure her old friends' freedom.  What becomes clear though is that though Kaye may think she knows what she is and who she loves, she may turn out to be very much mistaken.<br /><br />Several books kept leaping out at me as I read this one.  The idea of paying a tithe (the blood of a mortal) for the fairies?  I just read that recently in Elizabeth Pope's, \\"The Perilous Gard\\".  A rock and roll background mixed with fairies and the Seelie and Unseelie Court?  Straight out of \\"The War of the Oaks\\" by Emma Bull (which this book has MORE than a passing resemblance to).  Heck, a girl discovering that her real skin color is, in truth, green is vastly similar to, \\"Keeper of the Isis Light\\" by Monica Hughes.  Yet despite all the other books that this one reminded me of, it remained breathtakingly original from page one to three hundred and ten.  I appreciated how much Holly Black knew about fairies and their lives.  I liked how she incorporated these old factors with a text so contemporary that I was shocked to find references to online surfing and \\"The Sandman\\" graphic novels in it.  Yet when it all comes down to it, the thing that really blew me away was Black's writing itself.  I've rarely read such magnificent descriptions in a young adult story before.  Listen to this sentence, \\"He smiled a smile that was like sinking your teeth into cake\\".  Short.  Sweet (ha ha).  Well written enough that you have to pause and think about it a while.  Now imagine that every other sentence in this book is that intriguing and you have some sense of \\"Tithe\\" itself.<br /><br />And now the obligatory note to all concerned parents.  Yes, there is swearing in this book.  Frankly, it works within the context of the story and isn't gratuitous in the least.  Yes, there is more than one reference to sex.  Even (gasp, faint) gay sex.  Again, deal with it.  I was amazed that Black had to guts to put it in.  But then, Black constantly amazed me.  And for you parents who are concerned with teen books that actually deal with, oh I dunno, violence rather than the less disturbing sex and swearing that some parents seem gung ho to ban at every other opportunity, it exists in this story but it's not bad.  Nothing you couldn't see on network television.  If you want my advice you'll read the book yourself and, if you have any taste, enjoy it so thoroughly that you attempt to FORCE your kids to read it.  But then, that could just be me.<br /><br />In the end, \\"Tithe\\" is screaming in your face that a sequel is getting ready to be written.  And though I love the book, my heaping helpfuls of praise are merely meant to let you know that this book is amongst the best of its kind.  \\"Tithe\\" isn't going to win any Pulitzer Prizes or walk away with scads of literary praise.  But amongst the teen fantasy books out there, it's a standout.  Don't go into it expecting a dull fairy outing.  \\"Tithe\\" is probably more interesting than you bargained.more interesting than you bargained. <br />	2004-09-14

I'm always fascinated by those picture books so incredibly popular that they inspire highly sought after sequels.  We expect sequels from popular movies and television shows, but picture books are a different matter entirely.  What is it about a good book for children that causes masses of people to clamor for another of its ilk?  I ask all of this because Jon Scieszka's ingenious, \\"Math Curse\\", is a perfect example of what I'm asking.  Telling a simple tale of a boy (or possibly a girl) as he/she becomes enmeshed in a never ending day o' math problems, the book has recently been joined by the equally amusing \\"Science Verse\\".  As such, it deserves closer inspection.<br /><br />One day our protagonist (who, for lack of a gender, I will refer to in as unbiased a manner as I possibly can) wakes up with a problem.  Just the day before, the kid's teacher pronounced that, \\"You know, you can think of almost everything as a math problem\\".  Whoopsie!  Before you know it our hero is spinning in an out-of-control vortex of mathematically inspired thoughts and questions.  These range from the practical questions you'd often receive in school (\\"Mrs. Fibonacci has this CHART of what month everyone's birthday is in: 1. Which month has the most birthdays?  2. Which month has the fewest\\") to the downright silly (\\"What is another way to say 1/2 of an apple pie?  a. 2/6.  b. 3/6.  c. la moitie d'une tarte aux pommes\\").  By the end of the day our little protagonist can't take it any more.  Fortunately a fortuitous dream ends all math problems and in the morning everything's the same again.  This is until the teacher thinks to mention, \\"You know, you can think of almost everything as a science experiment\\".<br /><br />Don't get the impression by this review that this book is going to be dull to you parental English majors out there.  I can personally assure you that as a child/teen/adult I have hated and continue to hate all math related ventures.  Nonetheless, this book charmed me.  First of all, that has a lot to do with its creators.  I turn your attention now to the incomparable Jon Scieszka (pronounced shiss-ka, or so I am told) and his partner in crime Lane Smith.  If you're already familiar with their particularly original, \\"The Stinky Cheese Man, and Other Fairly Stupid Tales\\" or \\"The True Story of the Three Little Pigs\\", then you have some sort of an idea what to expect.  Both men are delightful twisted, but twisted in entirely different ways.  While Scieszka puns and takes an especial pleasure in silly statements and questions, Lane illustrates his pictures with creative psychotic aplomb.  The result is a book that's as vastly original as it is enjoyable to read through.<br /><br />Genuinely funny picture books are always too far and few between.  Since I can honestly tell you that this book is a droll little piece of chicanery that you should be sure not to miss, you've no need to worry.  Just go out and purchase it for your kids, your kids' friends, and children you've never seen before in your life but who may enjoy the laudable, \\"Math Curse\\".

Usually there's a great amount of build up to the event.  Maybe it's a mystery that you reach at the end.  Maybe the kids are innocent of the crime and it's all about clearing their names.  In the case of \\"Shattering Glass\\", however, the protagonist Young Steward does away with any and all misunderstandings right from the start.  \\"Simon Glass was easy to hate.  I never knew exactly why, there was too much to pick from.  I guess, really, we each hated him for a different reason, but we didn't realize it until the day we killed him\\".  And we're off!<br /><br />Four good buddies, Young, Rob, Bob, and Coop are the top of the pecking order at B'Vale High School.  They're handsome, popular, and all around respected fellows.  Rob is the unquestioned leader of the group, so when he proposes a crazy quest nobody raises any objections.  Rob has honed in on one Simon Glass, the resident loser of the school.  Glass is fat, uncool, and socially backward.  For Rob the ultimate challenge becomes the success of Simon Glass.  He becomes obsessed with it, using all his charm and resources to persuade people to help him in his crazy scheme.  Ever the follower, Young doesn't question Rob's goals.  Not even when he discovers the dark secret hiding in his best friend's past.  By the time the book reaching its horrifying conclusion you've already learned what happens to the four friends and the unfortunate Simon Glass.<br /><br />The book isn't a whodunit.  It's a towhatextentdunit.  By reading the little quotes that appear at the beginning of each chapter the reader begins to get a sense of what happened the night of Simon's death.  The question isn't what happened so much as it is, \\"Who was involved?\\".  It's more, \\"To what extent was Young involved?\\".  Giles is the master of the slow reveal.  She gives us just enough information throughout the story to be interested.  Then she'll toss in the occasional tantalizing detail just to suck us deeper into the story.  Best of all, Giles never creates a character without there being some kind of backstory involved.  If someone does something cruel or unfeeling, you can probably bet they've their own problems hidden away somewhere.  What I liked best of all was the character of Glass himself.  Simultaneously a victim and a victimizer, the object of everyone's attention turns out to be far cannier than anyone ever suspected.  In a way, I saw this book as a kind of updated \\"The Chocolate War\\".  In both cases a charming teen at the height of his school's society feels a need to keep himself at the top of the pecking order through the rigid control of others.  The only difference is, in \\"The Chocolate War\\" the villain decides to destroy a fellow student.  In this book, he aims to recreate him.  And the results are almost identical.<br /><br />Giles has debuted with a powerful first novel.  The book isn't, for the record, actually as good as \\"The Chocolate War\\", but it is the rare young adult novel that makes you think.  There's a lot of power behind Giles' words and her characters are a fascinating study.  As a former substitute teacher, she's aware of her subject matter and their social constraints.  Best of all, the book never falls into that old trap of an adult writing for teens and including lots of \\"hip\\" teen slang.  The closest this book ever comes to slang is the occasional \\"Yo!\\".  I can live with that.  In the end, \\"Shattering Glass\\" deserves its praise.  It may not be the nicest book about teen popularity out there, but it's certainly not the cruelest.tion throughout the story to be interested.

Can a series really be said to be ripping off the James Bond franchise if its characters constantly reference and mention him?  After reading Anthony Horowitz's first book in the phenomenally popular \\"Alex Rider\\" series, the answer is an unequivocal yes.  These books are catching on like wildfire amongst those kids captivated by the spy genre.  So I read through the first book and found it to be 007 in miniature.  Or rather, it's early racist 007 in miniature.  Chock full of fabulous gadgets, great chase sequences, and enough explosions to satisfy even the blood-thirstiest amongst us, it nonetheless suffers from an overabundance of clich&eacute;s.  \\"Stormbreaker\\" is a fun time, no question.  Just flawed.<br /><br />\\"When the doorbell rings at three in the morning, it's never good news\\". That's a good first sentence.  After being duly informed of his uncle's death, young Alex Rider (who had been adopted by his only living relative Ian Rider after his parents' death) harbors some suspicions about the cause of his uncle's demise.  Though to Alex, Ian Rider was merely a humble banker, some roundabout snooping reveals that Rider's death had more to do with a spray of bullets hitting his car than the reported \\"no seatbelt\\" cause given by the police.  Suddenly Alex finds himself enmeshed with M16, Britain's equivalent of the CIA.  Hired by this mysterious agency to spy for them (much as his uncle once did) Alex must investigate multi-millionaire Herod Sayle.  Egyptian by birth, Sayle wishes to donate his newest computer the \\"Stormbreaker\\" to every schoolchild living in Britain.  It's up to fourteen year old Alex to unlock the secrets of \\"Stormbreaker\\" and find out what really is going on with the mysterious Mr. Sayle.<br /><br />They say that if a gun appears in the first act of a play, you can bet your sweet bippy it'll be used by the third.  Similarly, if a huge aquarium containing a Portugese man-of-war appears in the early chapters of a teen spy novel, you can bet it'll come into play again before the end of book.  \\"Stormbreaker\\" is full of these interesting but obvious little ploys.  I wasn't surprised in the least that the villain owned a huge aquatic tank containing a poisonous sea creature.  Nor did I blink when his henchman was a fellow by the name of Mr. Grin, with no tongue and scars that traveled up the sides of his face in a hideous smile.  What did surprise me was the villain himself.  First of all, this book is full of white people.  Only one person of color appears in this tale, and he turns out to be a psychopath.  Originally born in Egypt, Herod Sayle saved the lives of two British tourists when he was a child and was unofficially adopted by them as a kind of thanks.  Having grown up in England he is, therefore, every white bigotted Englishman's worst nightmare.  This book is basically saying, \\"Never trust a foreigner!  You can take them into the bosom of your country and give them a wonderful life with freedom and opportunity and they'll STILL try to murder you in the end\\".  I would expect that kind of lesson in a book written in 1920.  And I might be a little put out to find it in a book written in 1960.  But to find it in a book written originally in 2000 isn't just offensive.  It's downright bizarre.<br /><br />So it's racist.  And how's the rest of it?  Fine n' dandy.  You can't beat Horowitz when it comes to fancy fighting and tricky gadgets.  The author has a nice grasp on cutting things to the close.  There's aren't any girls in this book that aren't either motherly or mannish (sometimes both) or end up being cold-hearted villainesses.  So don't enter into this expecting a love interest for Alex.  At least, not yet.  I was also impressed by how believable author Horowitz made Alex.  Coerced into working for M16 against his will, Alex acts like a relatively normal guy with, admittedly, abnormal abilities.  Everything he does you believe he'd do.  That's a mark of good writing.  Making people with dark skin out to be the villains?  Not so much.<br /><br />Spy novels used to hinge on xenophobia to a certain degree.  These days spy movies, television shows, and books are capable of creating villains that exceed such short sighted expectations.  That's why it's so offensive when books like \\"Stormbreaker\\" rely on archaic stereotypes to create animosity.  The book could have been just a fun jaunt into some great spy techniques.  And, for the most part, it is.  Just don't expect any great insights from this particular spyish outing.  And don't be surprised by its repugnant opinion of people of different nationalities.

His good books (like \\"The Gardener\\" and the recent \\"The Friend\\") are fabulous, as would be expected.  His mediocre books (which I won't mention by name but that are bound to happen to everyone once in a while) are still good reading but they won't blow you away.  \\"Imogene's Antlers\\" falls into neither the good nor the mediocre category.  It falls into the \\"Extraordinarily Fantastic\\" category.  It's just that great.<br /><br />One day little Imogene (last name unknown) wakes up to find that she has grown a full set of antlers out of her head.  Imogene isn't particularly perturbed by this discovery, finding it to be little more than a mild annoyance when she attempts to dress and leave her room.  Her family, on the other hand, doesn't like it one bit.  Still, when the doctor comes he can't find anything at all wrong with Imogene and the school principal, \\"glared at Imogene but had no advice to offer\\".  Imogene lives in a kind of old fashioned household and her family's servants are pleased with the change.  Lucy the kitchen maid hangs towels on the antlers while the cook, Mrs. Perkins, lets Imogene feed the birds with her donut strewn head.  Even the construction of large hats doesn't help and so Imogene goes to bed.  The next morning the antlers are gone and everyone is pleased.  Until they see her newest sprouting.<br /><br />I was first introduced to this l'il number through that incredible bit of children's programming, \\"Reading Rainbow\\" long ago.  The book read well on television and it reads even better in one's lap.  Small's pictures, which are sometimes a little too sketchy and haphazard, are perfect in this book.  Not only does the tale contain a fabulous surprise ending, but it's a great storyline.  Nothing particularly unpleasant ever happens to Imogene and it's her blas&eacute; way of going about her day that makes her character all the more appealing.  Small's text and pictures compliment one another perfectly.  Also, adults may find themselves learning new words like \\"milliner\\" in the course of reading this book to their children.  Kids reading the book will love how Imogene's mother is prone to fainting every other minute (while her grandfather seems bemused by the whole scene).  Kids will also enjoy discovering clues to Imogene's latest transformation in the picture where the girl wakes up without the antlers.<br /><br />This book would pair brilliantly with Steven Kellogg's \\"The Mysterious Tadpole\\".  Both books deal with interesting children in extraordinary situations.  And both have a similar surprise ending that include shots of chagrined parents.  If you're planning a storytime, these would work well together.  Alone, \\"Imogene's Antlers\\" is best viewed as a classic picture book.  I'm sad that it never won an award of any sort, but that's just the way it goes sometimes.  I urge you to pick up your own copy and flip through it whenever you have a chance.  Few books can really be called \\"timeless\\".  This is one of the few.ext and pictures compliment one another perfectly.

Kids will also enjoy discovering clues to Imogene's latest transformation in the picture where the girl wakes up without the antlers. <br />  <br />This book would pair brilliantly with Steven Kellogg's \\"The Mysterious Tadpole\\".  Both books deal with interesting children in extraordinary situations.  And both have a similar surprise ending that include shots of chagrined parents.  If you're planning a storytime, these would work well together.  Alone, \\"Imogene's Antlers\\" is best viewed as a classic picture book.  I'm sad that it never won an award of any sort, but that's just the way it goes sometimes.  I urge you to pick up your own copy and flip through it whenever you have a chance.  Few books can really be called \\"timeless\\".  This is one of the few. <br />	2004-09-12

Mostly these books are either folktales or deal directly with segregation and/or slavery.  \\"Uncle Jed's Barbershop\\" is a little different.  In it, the characters live in the deeply segregated South of the 1930s.  Rather than let this be the focus of the book, however, author Margaree King Mitchell has chosen to simply allow this to be the background to the actual story.  I appreciated greatly the fact that Mitchell was such an adept writer that she could teach kids history without making that history the focal point of the text.  When you add this fact to \\"Uncle Jed's\\" emotion packed storyline, you find you've a book that's not only well written and illustrated but also deeply meaningful.<br /><br />Sarah Jean lives with her parents on a farm in the South.  Her favorite relative, by far, is her granddaddy's brother, Uncle Jedediah.  The only black barber for miles around, Uncle Jed travels from home to home giving haircuts.  His dream, however, is to someday have a barbershop of his own with sinks, \\"so shiny they sparkled, the floor so clean you could see yourself\\".  When little Sarah Jean gets sick and needs an operation, however, Uncle Jed readily parts with the $300 required to make her better.  A few years later he saves enough money to buy the land and build a building when the Depression hits.  Suddenly all his money is gone and he has to start all over again.  Finally, at the grand old age of seventy-nine, his dream becomes a reality.  People from all over come to him and the now adult Sarah Jean sits in a seat and lets him twirl her around in a chair.  Says Sarah Jean at the end, \\"Uncle Jed died not long after that, and I think he died a happy man\\".  The final shot is of the autumn leaves falling past a window.  Inside, Jed sweeps the floor of the shop that he can now call his own.<br /><br />Much as with his \\"Sweet Clara and the Freedom Quilt\\" (which this book would pair brilliantly with during a storytime), illustrator James Ransome has done a superb job.  To prepare for these pictures, Ransome returned to his hometown in North Carolina, used old photographs of his grandfather's chickens, and included subtle elements that give each scene a sense reality and a flavor of its own.  There's a particularly autumnal feeling to this story as well.  The book begins with leaves falling and it ends with leaves falling.  Using his customary oil paint on paper, even the thickest of Ransome's lines contain enough delicacy to make the pictures seem real.  Uncle Jed is a great character in this pages and it's his vibrancy and stoicism that pulls the book together.  Mitchell's plot is a good one too.  Books with the moral of if-at-first-you-don't-succeed-try-try-again fall into two distinct camps.  Either they're schmaltzy goo of the \\"Little Engine That Could\\" variety, or they speak to something deep inside of us.  \\"Uncle Jed's\\" belongs to the latter category.  You agonize with Jed when he loses everything in the stock market.  And you're just as amazed as everyone else when he wins in the end, however briefly.<br /><br />I tend to avoid books with lessons because usually the lessons learned are poorly presented.  This book, however, has a lesson that I think has been given delightful packaging.  With Mitchell's words and Ransome's pictures, you've got yourself a heckuva book.

Now I'll admit right from the get-go that \\"Everything On a Waffle\\" did nothing for me and that such negative opinions of that book are usually in the strict minority.  Still, I thought my dislike of \\"Waffle\\" was a fluke.  Just one of those things that happens when you read a wide variety of children's books.  After all, I didn't like \\"From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler\\" either, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the author E.L. Konigsburg's enjoyable \\"The View From Saturday\\".  So I went into \\"The Canning Season\\" prepared to like it.  To my chagrin, what I found was a tale that combines the worst aspects of Horvath's writing with an underlying thread of nastiness.  This is an interesting book.  Just not a good one.<br /><br />Meet Ratchet.  If she had her way you'd probably not notice her too much.  The only companion of her domineering mother, Ratchet is a shy unassuming young teen.  Born with a hideous birth defect (never really described but often alluded to as merely \\"That Thing\\"), Ratchet one day finds herself summarily sent off to live with her mother's relatives Aunt Tilly and Aunt Penpen.  These women live deep in the Maine woods and are roughly 90 years of age but feisty to the last.  After settling in with the women and hearing their strange harrowing stories Ratchet just begins to relax when a pregnant woman and her young teenaged ward Harper arrive on the front porch.  Then things start to get a little crazy.<br /><br />The book has all the elements you would want in a tale of eccentrics.  Crazy old ladies who like to talk about how their mother chopped off her own head.  A silent girl with a horrid deformity.  Another girl with too much bravado and too little tact.  Plus there are crazy bears in the woods who'll eat anyone that gets near them!  Whee!  But Horvath seems to want to write a different kind of story.  It's as if she said to herself, \\"I don't want a touching `Northern Exposure' tale of delightful eccentrics here.  I want something a little odder and wilder.  Something the kids reading this book won't be expecting\\".  As a result the book is difficult to characterize.  I was a little shocked to find it in the children's section of my local library.  I mean, the cover looks cutesy and cartoony enough, sure.  But then you start running into talk of how Ratchet's mother would pretend she was throwing bits of Ratchet's placenta at the workers fixing pipes in her hospital room (it was really red jello, which is funny in a sick twisted way), a description of Tilly that says she, \\"looked like a sphincter\\", and a section in which the old women reminisce about a tutor they had that referred to them as the little f***s.  Now I'm 26 years of age and there's not a word or phrase you can throw at me that I haven't heard used one way or another.  But I have to admit I was just the teensiest bit shocked by these, and other passages.  I mean, some of them are funny.  Flying placentas.  Hee hee.  But what on earth is all this stuff doing in a kid's book?  Is Horvath trying to shake the kiddies out of their complacency?  Is she relying on shock value to keep their attention?  Surely good writing should be able to do that on its own, right?  Well, after reading the rest of this book... probably not.<br /><br />You see, aside from this teen novel being packaged in a childlike manner, the story is just plain mean.  I appreciate that Horvath didn't want to write another \\"Ruby Holler\\" and that's fine.  But even characters that care about one another in this tale are just doggone nasty (I keep using that word, but it really does describe the book the best for me).  I mean, there's no lighthearted undercurrent to this tale.  The jokes, while occasionally funny, are biting and contain a sneer.  Altogether, I found there wasn't a person in this story I really cared about or wanted to know more of later on down the road.  If Horvath had stopped writing this tale at the bottom of page 78 rather than at page 196 I couldn't have cared less.  Oh, and there's some odd wrapping up that goes on at the end of this book that ties up all the storylines and motivations with a neat little bow, but that's just so odd in the context of the story itself that it feels extraordinarily fake.<br /><br />So I didn't like it, no.  Not really.  Funny, since it won the 2004 National Book Award and has garnered praise hither and thither.  Thither and yon.  I can't join my voice to that chorus of congratulations, I'm afraid.  The book is, as I said, definitely full of life and character.  Horvath is certainly an able writer in terms of great sentences like, \\"It was like putting your hand on the heart of the earth.  It was like putting your hand on your own heart\\".  That's what makes her terrible book all the worse. You KNOW this could have been an excellent story.  You know that if she'd just toned down the edginess and tried to be a little less cool it could have been worthwhile reading.  Instead, it's a vile bile-filled book that drips with contempt and cruelty.  I hate to say it, but if you want a book about kids living with elderly caretakers in the woods you're better off sticking with Sharon Creech's, \\"Ruby Holler\\".  At least Creech knows how to use the talent she has.n the road.  If Horvath had stopped writing this tale at the bottom of page 78 rather than at page 196 I couldn't have cared less.

They like to believe that picture books hold no surprises for them and that the smartest picture books in the world are no match for grown-up wisdom and experience.  That's why I always appreciate those picture books that offer the unexpected.  Child readers know better than their parental counterparts.  They're aware that at any moment a picture book can offer surprising delights and plot twists.  After reading through \\"Tippy-Toe Chick, GO!\\" I remembered this.  At first the book looks like one of those stories in which a baby chicken following her mother and siblings becomes so entranced with the world around her that she becomes lost and confused.  There are roughly 5 million picture books with this exact plot.  Instead, and to my vast relief, the story was about a baby chick that uses its special skills to defeat an enemy of vast proportions and, as a result, win the love of her fellows.  And it's cute too.<br /><br />We meet a mother hen and her three chicks.  Wearing a Charlie Brownish expression of permanent worry, the hen takes her chicks every day to the nearby garden to eat itty-bitty beans and potato bugs (their favorite treat).  Big Chick and Middle Chick follow obediently but Little Chick tends to dawdle along to observe the world around her.  When she sees that she has fallen behind she runs \\"tippy-toe, tippy-toe\\" to catch up.  This routine happens with great regularity until one day a dog on a rope prevents the family from making their daily garden run.  The chicks are, needless to say, put out.  To stop the dog the Big Chick attempts to reason with the dog.  No good.  Then the Middle Chick tries threats.  No good.  Finally, the Little Chick decides to try her hand (in spite of the laughter of her siblings).  She runs \\"tippy-toe, tippy-toe\\" at the dog and around a tree.  The dog follows angrily until it gets caught and the others are able to safely get to the garden.  The last shot is of Little Chick descending on a large juicy potato bug with the word, \\"YUM!\\".<br /><br />With a catchy title like, \\"Tippy-Toe Chick, GO!\\" you'd kind of expect the book to be of the rhyming variety.  This is not the case.  Though there's a lot of enjoyment to be had in reading \\"tippy-toe, tippy-toe\\" over and over, that's about as rhythmic as it gets.  The text is rather straightforward, but with a nature that's fun.  Some words are in bold or capitalized to help adult readers know what phrases to stress.  I'm not sure if there's a moral to the story beyond, \\"Little people can help too\\" (a staple in children's literature and folktales).  Are we supposed to learn something when reason and violence don't work against opponents?  Are we to assume that outsmarting them is the only recourse left?  Or am I reading too much into a 27 page picture book?  Whatever the case, the illustrations to this story are as simple as the text.  Drawn by artist Laura Dronzek (married, as it happens, to the fabulous children's author/artist Kevin Henkes of \\"Lily's Purple Plastic Purse\\" fame), the pictures are big, bright, and colorful.  With minimum expressions, Dronzek is able to convey each animal's emotions perfectly.  The pictures are broken up nicely into full colorful spreads, images where characters react on a pure white background, and (in at least one case) four individual pictures spanning two pages.  Altogether, the artist has matched her illustrations nicely to the story.<br /><br />\\"Tippy-Toe Chick, GO!\\" isn't the most original picture book out there today, but it's one of the nicest.  And while kids probably won't go gagga over it (as they would with, say, \\"Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus\\") they'll like it quite a lot.

First, I read tons of professional reviews of the newest books coming out.  Then I systematically make a list and work my way through it, often including old standbys and books from my own youth that I'd like to reexamine.  THEN I finally check out a book or two and review it for fun.  I almost never deviate from this pattern except on special occasions.  Such an occasion arose just the other day when I was pawing through my local library.  I was in a new library attempting to find some of the books on my list when the title, \\"Dumpy La Rue\\" caught my eye.  I'd never heard of \\"Dumpy La Rue\\".  I was familiar with the illustrator Betsy Lewin (of \\"Click Clack Moo\\" and \\"Duck For President\\" fame) but not author Elizabeth Winthrop.  But one glance on the cover of a delightful pig in a spotlight and I was sold.  I mean, with a title like \\"Dumpy La Rue\\" and a fun frolicsome pig, how could I resist?  Out the window goes my careful selection process.  Into my home comes \\"Dumpy La Rue\\".<br /><br />The first sentence of the book sums it up.  \\"Dumpy La Rue wanted to dance\\".  Of course, Dumpy has a couple facts not in his favor.  First of all he's a pig.  As his father is quick to inform him, \\"Pigs don't dance\\".  Second, he's a boy.  His sister points out that \\"They fight, they march, they sport, and they snort.  And they're never ever supposed to cavort\\".  None of this discourages Dumpy one little bit.  Soon he's dancing in full view of the entire barnyard (much to the embarrassment of his family members).  Before you know it the sheep want to join in.  Then everyone wants to.  Instructing them to listen to the music inside everyone closes their eyes and does so.  Before you know it everyone's in on the act, even Dumpy's ma, pa, and sister.  Says the last sentence in the book, \\"The Barnyard Ballet of Dumpy La Rue.  The pig who knew what he wanted to do\\".<br /><br />The story's got a catchy rhyming beat that difficult to resist.  Winthrop also knows exactly which dance terms to include.  For those with a basic background in ballet, note the phrase, \\"He did a glissade and pas de bourree.  From slop heap to bucket, he jeted his way\\".  I advise you to help kids learning to read with that part (and to learn the pronunciation of the French yourself if you've a mind to).  As catchy as the words are, however, they're nothing compared to Lewin's illustrations.  You know, I liked \\"Click Clack Moo\\", but I always felt that Lewin's accompanying pictures were the weak point of that tale.  They lacked a kind of verve and technical accomplishment.  Had I but known that she was capable of the kind of fabulous energy and bounce found in \\"Dumpy La Rue\\" I would have definitely taken her to task.  In this book Lewin has gone all out.  From the sheep chorus line on the endpapers to the lengthening shadows on the dancing animals throughout the day, Lewin's got it going on.  She uses watercolors to give the night sky behind the barnyard dance a kind of blue/purple distinctness.  I've never seen her give such great movement and character to her drawings before.  Heck, if you can look at the adorable title page containing a smiling Dumpy La Rue perched on a sign and NOT want to read this book then you're a hard hard case.<br /><br />The message I can take or leave.  Stories about \\"being yourself\\" abound and this one's hardly any different.  Far better (and worth the price of the book alone) are Betsy Lewin's illustrations.  I kid you not, they're the best dancing animal illustrations I've ever seen.  I know that Steven Kellogg wrote a fairly similar story to this one recently about a dancing cow (\\"Clorinda\\") so you might consider pairing the two together.  Both have their charms, but \\"Dumpy La Rue\\" includes an entire barnyard conglomeration of dancing animals.  Few books can boast as much.

527293:US	49148452	R26PFP1O4OI3Y	048627263X	467344666	Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (Dover Thrift Editions)	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Some of my best friends are square	The persecution of individuals is an abhorrent way of life in some lands.  To be repressed simply for preaching a new view of things.  To be imprisoned for your beliefs.  I am thinking, at this moment, of one individual in particular who has had to suffer the humiliation of life without parole simply because he chooses to see things in a different way.  Should the fact that this person is merely a square (four equal sides and corners) be any kind of an impediment towards our full understanding of him?  As a recent convert to three-dimensional worlds, the author of \\"Flatland\\" (given, originally, as merely A. Square) describes his own two-dimensional existence as best as he is able.  It is hoped that perhaps by publishing this petite memoir of his world and experiences he may shed new light on his predicament and perhaps even win a follower or two.<br /><br />The world of Flatland (as opposed to our own multi-dimensional Spaceland) is a simple one.  In it, the more sides an individual has, the (supposedly) greater intelligence and influence.  Therefore it stands to reason that circles (which is to say, many sided polygons) rule as priests and all hexagons, squares, triangles, etc. hope to someday ascend or let their children ascend to that most worthy class.  Women, sadly, are given short shift.  They appear as lines (though the narrator does concede later on that they are perhaps more accurately described as very thin Parallelograms.  The narrator goes on to describes how shapes in Flatland recognize one another, what their lives are like, and even gives a bit of brief historical background regarding the great Chromatic Sedition that almost made all shapes equal under the eyes of the law and society.  The square then recounts the adventures he had when, in a dream, he approached Lineland and then was visited by a sphere preaching the gospel of the Spaceland.  With the discovery of a third dimension the square is given to preaching about this new place to his fellows and, for his efforts, is summarily arrested and cast into prison from whence he writes this book.<br /><br />\\"Flatland\\" was originally published in 1884, a fact that places some of its odder elements into (ha ha) perspective.  Appended with a Preface that accompanied its second revised addition, the \\"author\\" (A. Square) responds to those critics that accuse him of classism and sexism.  The square admits that years in prison may have, since the publication of the book, given him greater insight into both women AND his \\"betters\\".  Just the same, it's difficult for a reader today to hear that women are \\"consequently wholly devoid of brain-power, and have neither reflection, judgement nor forethought, and hardly any memory\\" and not feel a little put out.  On the other hand, we're dealing with some serious satire here, and we should treat the book accordingly.  In general, it's a delight.  Paving the way for such modern classics as \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" or even \\"A Wrinkle In Time\\" (the latter making at least one direct reference to \\"Flatland\\"), the book is a satire in the finest sense of the word.  The narrator is, undoubtedly, unreliable which makes the entire book just that much more enjoyable.  Author Edwin A. Abbott put an extraordinary amount of effort into this story.  As is often the case with authors that slum in fiction, children's literature, or works of humor (right off the top of my head I'm thinking of Gilbert & Sullivan and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle), \\"Flatland\\" was written as a bit of fluff and ended up (whether Abbott liked it or not) as the author's best known work.<br /><br />Though a lovely concept, this book is perhaps best read by teens and adults rather that kids.  I'm not saying that there won't be the spectacularly brainy ten year old who's a fan of both Math AND English and speeds through this book like butter.  I'm just saying that such a child is in the minority and that you probably shouldn't foist a tale that contains such sentences as \\"Now, all our lines are equally and infinitesimally thick (or high, whichever you like): consequently, there is nothing in them to lead our minds to the conception of that Dimension\\".  You get the picture.  One fact I discovered to my own delight was that this book does not, in fact, require a firm grasp on geometry.  It couldn't hurt, and I'm sure you'll get quite a lot more out of it than if you've heard of angles or circumferences, but it's not a prerequisite for enjoying this tale.  As long as you've a certain amount of imagination and a will to suspend disbelief, you should be in the clear.<br /><br />The Saturday Review of Literature once said that Flatland was, \\"One of the best things of its kind ever written\\".  This seems to me to be somewhat backhanded praise since very few \\"things of its kind\\" HAVE ever been written.  And shouldn't it be unequivocally be pronounced the best by default alone?  To my mind, the book's well worth the reading.  It deserves its praise and should be remembered amongst the best of the fantastical satires (\\"Gulliver's Travels\\" for example).  It's a short book too, so you've really no excuse for not reading it.  A delightful dip into the unknown.as \\"Now, all our lines are equally and infinitesimally thick (or high, whichever you like): consequently, there is nothing in them to lead our minds to the conception of that Dimension\\".  You get the picture.  One fact I discovered to my own delight was that this book does not, in fact, require a firm grasp on geometry.  It couldn't hurt, and I'm sure you'll get quite a lot more out of it than if you've heard of angles or circumferences, but it's not a prerequisite for enjoying this tale.  As long as you've a certain amount of imagination and a will to suspend disbelief, you should be in the clear.   <br />  <br />The Saturday Review of Literature once said that Flatland was, \\"One of the best things of its kind ever written\\".  This seems to me to be somewhat backhanded praise since very few \\"things of its kind\\" HAVE ever been written.  And shouldn't it be unequivocally be pronounced the best by default alone?  To my mind, the book's well worth the reading.  It deserves its praise and should be remembered amongst the best of the fantastical satires (\\"Gulliver's Travels\\" for example).  It's a short book too, so you've really no excuse for not reading it.  A delightful dip into the unknown.   <br /> <br />	2004-09-09

Following up the massive success of her phenomenal \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\", authoress extraordinaire L'Engle decided to stretch her literary muscles a little further with the sequel \\"A Wind in the Door\\".  Drawing more heavily on Christian imagery and themes than its predecessor, \\"A Wind in the Door\\" is a remarkable effort.  Combining metaphysics, Old Testament creations, and the microcosmic building blocks of life, in this book we learn that sometimes growing up and getting older is necessary.  Think of this story as the anti-Peter Pan, if you will.<br /><br />Making zippo references to any of the plot points in \\"A Wrinkle In Time\\" (with the exception of an oblique mention of Earth as a shadowed planet and some brief background on Meg's relationship with Calvin), we once again meet our oh-so normal protagonist Meg Murry.  She dotes on her little brother Charles Wallace quite a bit, but when he suddenly makes an announcement one day that there are dragons in the garden she's reasonably confused.  Meg's had a lot on her mind lately too.  There's the fact that Charles has been getting beaten up regularly at school and he's been strangely ill as well.  As it turns out, Charles Wallace's condition is cause for concern on a particularly cosmic scale.  Before she knows it, Meg has joined forces with a cherubim (a particularly Revelation-like creature made of all eyes and wings), a snake, a man from another world, her beloved boyfriend Calvin, and (most strangely) her former elementary school principal Mr. Jenkins.  Together, this motley crew must do battle in the cells of Charles Wallace's very mitochondria, fighting against the evil Echthroi (a kind of fallen angels).<br /><br />What I've always liked about Madeleine L'Engle's Christian infused tales is that they don't bop you over the head with didacticism.  I mean, compare this book with (oh, say) C.S. Lewis's \\"The Last Battle\\".  In both cases adept writers have conjured up magical worlds and creatures for young readers.  Yet while Lewis ends up sending kids messages like \\"use make-up and you won't get into heaven\\" (paraphrased but definitely a message in the final Narnia tale), L'Engle sends the message \\"love is the saving grace\\".  Which would you rather read?  Better yet, which would you prefer for your children?<br /><br />I did find it a little odd that Meg was continually astounded by fantastical events in this tale.  I mean, doesn't she remember the oddities that occurred to her in \\"A Wrinkle In Time\\"?  After you've faced down a gigantic evil pulsating brain, I'd think ANYTHING would strike you as possible.  Still, this is a great book to introduce to those readers who never got around to \\"A Wrinkle\\".  It doesn't really require any explanation or backstory.  I also particularly enjoyed the science introduced in this book.  If you've a kid that loves science but is also into fantasy, this book is a perfect match.  From it I've just learned that mitochondria have their own DNA.  Who knew?  L'Engle.  That's who.<br /><br />Looking back on it, when I was a kid I tended to skim through books that bored me, and this tale certainly fit the bill.  Still, reading it again today I think that if I'd just stuck with it, I could have really enjoyed it.  And I truly believe that some kids reading it today will love it through and through.  I mean, in what other tale are you going to come to the undeniable conclusion that partying is in our genes?

If you are looking for a writer who writes books containing happy unicorns and cute dancing sprites, Nix is not for you.  In this, his first teen novel (amazingly good on that level alone) he creates a world of death, destruction, death, decay, and a little more death.  His heroine constantly walks in the lands of the dead, fights the moral equivalent of zombies left and right, and is gratifyingly competent.  Nix is that rare male author that is just as comfortable penning gruesome fight sequences as he is the intricacies of female menstruation.  If you're looking for a kickin' gal in a wholly original fantasy, \\"Sabriel\\" is the book to look up.<br /><br />The only daughter of her father, a man referred to by everyone as Abhorsen, Sabriel grew up in a female boarding school.  Don't expect this to be yet another Harry Potter-like creation, however.  Mere pages after we see our eighteen year old heroine within the walls of her home she has discovered that her father is in dire peril.  You see, the Abhorsen is the mage that fights continually to keep the creatures of the dead out of the lands of the living.  With the realization that her father needs her help, Sabriel becomes the Abhorsen herself and travels to a distant Old Kingdom to save him.  Along the way she picks up the small white cat Mogget, a kind of snarky sarcastic servant bound to help the Abhorsens for generations.  She also meets and rescues the man Touchstone, a guilt ridden man trapped in the bow of a ship for 200 years.  Making continually trips into the world of Death, Sabriel discovers her own destiny and must decide how to fight the Abhorsens' greatest enemy.<br /><br />Garth Nix is the master of the action sequence.  I read one of Mr. Nix's earlier books, \\"Shade's Children\\" not long ago and, like this book, that one was obsessed with the nature of life and death.  This book is slightly less gory than the former, but only just slightly.  If you haven't the stomach for books in which zombies (Nix never calls them this, but if we're gonna be honest this book is just a slightly fantastical reinterpretation of \\"Night of the Living Dead\\") try to eat our young heroine, young women have their throats slit by their own brother, and humanoids with Bosch-like characteristics flop about every other page... don't bother with this one.  If, on the other hand, you've a strong stomach and a taste for the peculiar, Nix is worth the read.  Like many male authors, he's not comfortable giving his heroine a sense of humor, but otherwise Sabriel is a pip.  She's competent and careful.  At the same time, she isn't a superhero or anything.  Sabriel makes mistakes once in a while or overextends herself when she shouldn't.  Other characters in this story may appear a little familiar.  Mogget the cat bears a striking resemblance to the far more recent Bartimaeus from \\"The Amulet of Samarkand\\" in terms of snide servility.  As for Touchstone, he's basically Taran from \\"The Chronicles of Prydain\\".  Nix is such an accomplished writer, however, that even as you read these familiar characters, they seem fresh and interesting.<br /><br />It takes a very certain kind of person to be a Garth Nix fan.  If you're into women kicking butt, there's no butt kicker more accomplished than the clever Sabriel.  Nix truly has written an incredibly detailed and original world.  From the villains to the Abhorsen's weapons of choice (mainly bells) this book is like no other fantasy novel written today.  As long as you understand that this book is not a namby pamby tale written with anything even mildly cutesy (except, perhaps, the potentially murderous and fluffy Mogget), you will go into this tale prepared.

527604:US	49148452	R1UJVQ5X5T2ZKL	0385730586	122662979	Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (Book 1)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Sing the praises of pants	I think that it is safe to say that the mark of any good writer is his or her ability to write meaningful complex characters.  Equally, it is also a mark of a good writer to have the ability to write fifteen year old girl characters that are plausibly adolescent and, at the same time, people you wouldn't want to throttle slowly if you met them in person.  Ann Brashares has, perhaps, done the impossible.  She has written four, count `em, four female teens with messy lives, hopelessly screwed up parents, and bouncy trouncy hormones and made them lovable.  If that doesn't deserve a prize of some kind, I don't know what does.<br /><br />Meet Lena, Tibby, Bridget, and Carmen.  They're fifteen and they're about to spend their first summer apart from one another.  Breathtakingly beautiful Lena is staying with her Grecian grandparents in the Mediterranean.  Wry sarcastic Tibby is stuck working in a thinly disguised Walmart.  Athletic Bridget is off to soccer camp in Baja along the South American shore.  As for Carmen, our narrator for the Prologue and Epilogue of this tale, she's going to stay with her divorced pop in Florida.  With the interesting gimmick of a pair of magical blue jeans that fit each of the four girls perfectly (an enchantment many of us may wish we had access to), the friends send the pants amongst one another throughout the warm months in the hope that they'll help them through their individual adventures.  In the course of the tale the pants will be bloodied, muddied, sanded up, and removed with disastrous consequences.<br /><br />I found myself becoming quite impressed with author Ann Brashares as I read through this book.  Expecting the kind of giggly girly book found in the \\"Gossip Girl\\" series or the \\"A-List\\" books, I wasn't actually expecting to be touched by this tale at all.  What struck me from the start was the fact that although the pants are introduced immediately from the get go, Brashares avoids writing a tale in which the narrative moves with the pants and the pants alone.  Instead, we hear all about the girls and their miseries (of which they each have quite a few) in spite of where the jeans may land.  The text is broken up into letters, insights, and narratives.  Anal retentive little beast that I am, I was a little too pleased to find that the \\"handwriting\\" of the letters between the girls was consistent with the text (Lena is described as having the nicest writing, a fact that the rest of the book attests).<br /><br />A good way to determine whether or not you'll like this book is to read the ten rules governing the use of the pants (provided on the back cover for easy reference).  If you do not find such rules as \\"#2. You must never double cuff the Pants.  It's tacky.  There will never be a time when this will not be tacky\\" (as true as it is sublime) to be amusing, it's probably best to avoid this book.  I myself was pleased at the range of characters in it, though.  Certainly the tale falls back on a lot of old standbys.  There's the hard hearted punk girl that learns to care about others through the intervention of a child with cancer (honest).  There's the goddess-like beauty with zero self-confidence.  But Brashares gives these tried and true stereotypes a little more life and verve.  She also makes some literary choices that I approved of.  While acknowledging the dehumanizing atmosphere of any and all Walmarts, she points out that the people in them are, in fact, human.  She also, without actually saying it, makes it clear that the reason the four girls are as close as they are is because their parents are all so screwy (with the possible exception of Carmen's mom).  At this point in the girls' lives they're finally able to see the inherent flaws of their mothers and fathers without yet being able to detach themselves fully.  Parents are still important in this book, no matter how negligent or half-brained they may act.<br /><br />So I was delightfully surprised by this book.  Heck, any tale that can make me tear up is worthwhile reading, to my mind.  It may have taken until the top of page 283, but Ann Brashares definitely got me in the end.  Now, don't get me wrong.  This isn't \\"Catcher In the Rye\\" or anything.  And while the insights into life and living are definitely heads above your average \\"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul\\", it's still a pretty fluffy piece of work.  But the world needs good fluff.  Fluff is what fills our days and makes us happy when we can't take anymore depressing \\"aaht\\".  There's good and bad fluff in the world.  Be sure you throw you're cap into the \\"Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\\" camp.k.  Heck, any tale that can make me tear up is worthwhile reading, to my mind.

527913:US	49148452	RWI7130V04FXU	0064472051	75593092	The Hounds of the Morrigan	Books	5	11	12	N	N	Imprison it in iron	With the surge of popularity for fantasy based kid's books (all thanks, in part, to that marvelous Harry O'Potter) there has been a glut on the market.  Too many poorly written and poorly conceived works of children's literature are out there.  It is the job of conscientious librarians, parents, and booksellers to weed through the mire and muck and find the rare true treasures out there.  I'd been wading through muck for quite some time when it occurred to me that now was perhaps the best time to turn my attention to that hardly recognized classic, \\"The Hounds of the Morrigan\\".  Originally published in 1985, the book is one of the purest fantasy novels ever written with children in mind.  Combining old school fantasy elements with undiluted Irish myth and mythology, children in love with talking animals and evil witches need look no further than Pat O'Shea's riveting first novel.<br /><br />Pidge doesn't mean to unleash an evil serpent upon the world but that's just the way things go sometimes.  After having purchased an old manuscript containing a trapped creature of evil within its pages, Pidge finds himself in the center of a great grand adventure.  It seems that the evil Morrigan, a kind of malevolent goddess split into three bodies, wishes to devour the serpent Olc-Glass and add its power to her own.  The only means of defeating her in this effort lie in finding a drop of the Morrigan's blood that will destroy both the serpent and her plans.  With his five year old sister Brigit in tow, ten year old Pidge sets out to find the pebble of blood and escape the Morrigan's hounds that follow him at every turn.<br /><br />High fantasy has never been so epic.  Author Pat O'Shea is extraordinarily gifted as she describes the wonders and horrors that confront the siblings at every turn.  The book slips effortlessly between various Irish myths (some involving the great warrior Cuchulain, some ancient Druids, and some the Seven Maines).  Prepare to brush up on your Gaelic as you find yourself skimming such names as Tir-na-nOg, Millskuhuch, and Baile-na-gCeard. What makes the book so readable, however, is the writing itself.  Adventures and unexpected delights await Pidge and the very five year old Brigit at every turn.  Yet even the most horrible moments in this tale are tempered by the knowledge that things will turn out all right in the end.  I originally read this tale years and years ago and its funny to find the elements that have stuck with me since then.  I could remember the fox Coo Roo and his love of sausages and I remembered the floating disgusting fingerprint of the Morrigan.  Things I forgot and read with anewed pleasure included the ridiculous and wonderful frog Puddeneen Whelan and the great love of his life Miss Fancy Finnerty.  I think what really makes \\"The Hounds\\" stand out as a fantasy novel, in addition to its originality and historical elements, is its humor.  Mind you, there are plenty of jokes that American kids simply will NOT get.  If you thought the original editions of Harry Potter were too oblique for the minds of little ones then you obviously should avoid this book as well.  Which is a great pity since the jokes that I DID get were fabulous.  As a child I took Scottish Highland dancing, and I was quite adept at the Highland Fling.  Imagine my amusement, then, when a small spider in this book announces that it will now dance the Fly Land Hing.  The book's rife with jokes of that nature.  Just to warn you.<br /><br />Honestly, this is probably the best Irish fantasy book for children ever written.  Hands down.  I mean, what other book so deftly combines elements of the goddess Kali with the Three Graces to deliver a breathtakingly evil villainess?  Some people will raise the hue and cry bloody murder at the fact that the Morrigan is seen as all evil in this tale.  To those who dislike this interpretation of the ancient goddess, chill out.  Seriously.  Pat O'Shea has merely taken a fable and adapted it toher delightful children's book.  If you want a story about the \\"true\\" Morrigan, (whatever that may mean) search elsewhere.  This book has plenty to recommend it.  I mean, where else do siblings act as tenderly and compassionately towards one another as Pidge and Brigit do?  And let me tell you, it is a great relief to root for characters that are as likable and complex and these delightful two.  Some kids may be daunted at the 675 page length of this novel.  Others will blow through it like it was the Sunday Times (especially those who've already done so with the aforementioned Mr. Potter).  With a helpful Glossary of Terms and pronunciation at the back and an acknowledgement section that gives some superb sources, this tale has it all.  I tell you now that you cannot claim to know anything about the depths of fantasy until you have read this book.

Which is to say, it's not saying much.  Now, it is very difficult for a reviewer such as myself to read and review this book without pounds of prejudice weighing on my head.  I'll be perfectly honest with you:  I am a librarian.  One of the thousands that took offense when Madonna announced that her reason for writing children was as follows: \\"Now I'm starting to read to my son, but I couldn't believe how vapid and vacant and empty all the stories were\\".  Presumably Madonna must've been reading the latest \\"Dora the Explorer\\" to her son.  Or perhaps she had been given a copy of \\"Love You Forever\\".  In any case, this inane reason for writing some picture books of her own spawned some of the foulest bits of treacle ever to grace the shelves of bookstores and libraries worldwide.  If you think \\"Rainbow Fish\\" sends a poorly spelled out message, I assure you that it has NOTHING when compared to Madonna's hokey schmaltz-fest \\"Mr. Peabody's Apples\\".<br /><br />So as you can see, I'm not exactly an unbiased reader.  Still, \\"Yakov and the Seven Thieves\\" looked different from her other stories.  Unlike \\"The English Roses\\" (moral: Pretty people are nice too) and \\"Mr. Peabody's Apples\\" (moral:  In small town America, gossip is naughty) this story looked a little classier.  It was written as a fable (good), with a delightful illustrator at the helm (good) and some really original elements in terms of characters and descriptions (very good).  Then I got to the end of the tale and the whole kerschmazzle blew up in my face.  Though she definitely starts strong and has a good idea of what her plot shoudl be, in the end \\"Yakov and the Seven Thieves\\" is still weakety weak weak.<br /><br />In this tale, there was once a poor cobbler named Yakov.  Yakov had a single son whom he loved very very much.  Unfortunately the boy was often sickly and weak.  In desperation, Yakov searched out the wisest man in town, an older gentleman who lived with his grandson alone.  The wise man hears Yakov's problem and attempts to pray to God to save Yakov's son.  This doesn't go particularly well and Yakov is distraught.  In a moment of inspiration, the wise man tells his grandson to gather the most despicable thieves in town and bring them to his home.  The seven thieves comes (apparently thieves are religious at heart) and when asked by the old man to pray for Yakov's son.  They do so, the son is miraculously cured, and a sappy message about how the thieves were symbolically opening the gates of heaven sums the book up.  Then there's an odd tacked on ending in which a thief named Boris the Barefoot Midget returns the grandson's stolen shoes and, when told he can keep them, scurries down the road.  The end.<br /><br />I'm a big big fan of a well told folktale and for quite some time Madonna was doing really well on this story.  She has a nice section at the beginning about how Yakov enjoyed the scenery of his home, \\"the magical forests, the crystal-clear streams, and the majestic snowcapped mountains that rose before him in the distance\\".  She does especially well when describing the different thieves (with the possible exception of the somewhat offensive Boris the Barefoot Midget).  But Madonna isn't particularly good at summarizing the morals of her tales.  Though it sounds funny to hear it, Madonna is the preachiest children's author I've ever read, outside of Christian fiction itself.  If you're into incredibly didactic religious picture books, methinks \\"Yakov\\" is for you.  The book ends happily because the thieves, afraid that the wise old man is magical and potentially dangerous (\\"Was he a wizard?... Did he have magical powers?\\") suddenly decide that because he's sincere (they're bad guys... but not too bad) they should pray for a little sick boy they've never seen.<br /><br />Some people will be very touched by this tale.  Others will find themselves stumbling a little over the stilted language employed (I dare you to find a single contraction in this entire book).  Still more will enjoy the book, get to the ending, and find themselves uncomfortable with its overly earnest preaching.  Now, the illustrations in this puppy are fan-freakin'-tastic, no question.  They're beautifully rendered and bring a lifelike vibrancy to the various sundry thieves.  My favorite shot in this tale, bar none, is the picture of the Angel of Death hovering over the sleeping sick lad.  This is a gorgeous tale to flip through.  If you'd like to just buy the book and cut out the pictures to frame on your wall, that would undoubtedly be the best use of this creation.  Just don't bother reading it or anything.<br /><br />I'm being rather harsh, I admit.  As I mentioned before, I'm biased.  I don't know how much a biased review is worth to you.  But as long as you understand exactly where I'm coming from, this review should give you some kind of an indication as to how good or bad Madonna's third book is.  I have said that it's the best of the three she's written so far.  Still, if you want a picture book that tells a didactic fable about faith in a cold Russian land, try the Caldecott winning (and mind-blowingly illustrated) \\"Baboushka and the Three Kings\\" by R. Robbins.  If you want a picture book that tells an amusing and original folktale, try the outrageous \\"Swamp Angel\\" by Anne Isaacs (more of a tall tale than a folktale admittedly) or the fabulous \\"It Could Always Be Worse\\" by Margot Zemach.  And if you want a picture book written by a pop star with seemingly little experience writing good books for children but that is just a tinge more saccharine than is comfortable, try the tepid, \\"Yakov and the Seven Thieves\\".d by this tale.  Others will find themselves stumbling a little over the stilted language employed (I dare you to find a single contraction in this entire book).

First off, this book would pair brilliantly with Deborah Hopkinson's, \\"Sweet Clara and the Freedom Quilt\\".  Utilizing a style not unlike the classic slave quilts featured in \\"Sweet Clara\\", \\"Tar Beach\\" tells a contemporary story while tying its narrative to the history of African American storytelling.  Before I say anything else, though, I should warn you about something.  When I first read this book I had borrowed it from my local lending library.  The copy I got out was a hardcover from 1991.  Now, do you remember getting books when you were a kid and they, not to put too fine a point on it, stank?  Certain picture books have some kind of binding glue or something that, over time, makes them stink to high heaven.  This book was especially smelly and even as it sits next to me here on my desk I'm reluctant to open it up for reference because of its offensive odor.  It's quite possible, even probable, that the editions of this book being sold now (being paperback and all) are smell free and no longer printed so as to attack one's olfactory senses.  Just don't buy a used hardcover copy from 1991.  That's all I'm saying.<br /><br />In this tale a small African-American girl dreams of flight.  In her flight she is powerful and free.  The George Washington bridge, a magnificent structure that her father helped to build, is a diamond necklace around her neck.  Flying high, the girl gives her father the union building he's working on, \\"Then it won't matter that he's not in their old union, or whether he's colored or a half-breed Indian, like they say\\".  With her father so gainfully employed her mother \\"won't cry all winter\\" when her dad goes out looking for work.  She'll be able to sleep late and (this is the most heartbreaking part for me), \\"we can have ice cream every night for dessert\\".  The girl daydreams these flights while the family goes up to what they like to call Tar Beach.  On the roof of their building they have peanuts and chicken and watermelon as well.  She sums up by explaining, \\"it's very easy, anyone can fly.  All you need is somewhere to go that you can't get to any other way.  The next thing you know, you're flying among the stars\\".<br /><br />On the last two pages of the book a long history of author/illustrator Faith Ringgold explains her life, the history of her work, the history of African Americans in the 1930s, and the basis of this tale.  A quilter by trade, the left page displays the amazing quilt that inspired \\"Tar Beach\\" the book.  In this quilt, the girl and her brother sit not too far from their parents and neighbors.  Above, the girl soars over the George Washington Bridge and the words of the book are written into the fabric of the quilt.  Parents reading this book to their kids would do well to read the summary at the end of the tale to themselves before reading the picture book to their children.  That way they'll be better equipped to answer any potential questions the children might bring up regarding labor union practices regarding African Americans or the history of flight in the stories of slaves.  This book covers a lot of ground.  The basis of the tale itself is rooted in Ringgold's own experiences of growing up in Harlem as a child.  She even gives a little background on the characters discussed within the tale and their lives.<br /><br />The book is drawn using acrylics on canvas paper with the occasional quilted piece appearing on the sides.  As for the plot, kids reading the book may be a little confused as to whether or not the heroine of the tale actually is flying or if it's just in her head.  After all, there's a pretty clear picture of her little brother lying below looking up as his sister soars.  If kids are able to get past that little detail, however, they'll probably love the tale.  I mean, who hasn't wanted to fly freely over friends and family?  Who hasn't wanted to give their parents everything they'd need to be happy?  Or, for that matter, own an ice cream factory?<br /><br />The book is well rooted in history, imagination, and colorful storytelling.  With a pedigree such as this, it's hard not to admire it thoroughly.  And if you'd like yet another book to pair it with during your storytime, consider \\"The Little Red Lighthouse and the Great Gray Bridge\\" by H.H. Smith, which is ALSO about the building of the George Washington bridge.  Altogether this is an important book with a well told message.ry? <br />  <br />The book is well rooted in history, imagination, and colorful storytelling.

As you can see, my Chadian knowledge was lacking.  Then I picked up \\"Calabash Cat and His Amazing Journey\\".  This title had intrigued me for a couple reasons.  For one thing, it was visually stunning.  I'm a sucker for intricate linework, and \\"Calabash Cat\\" is awash in tiny details and clever little strokes of the pen.  Also, I had heard that this tale was written in both English and Arabic.  I am currently under the impression that there is a distinct lack of good Arabic books out there for kids in America to read.  To my mind, a book like \\"Calabash Cat\\" might well fill a few gaps.  So I picked it up for a look-see.<br /><br />In this fable, we meet a calabash cat.  One day, the cat decides to see exactly where the world ends.  It stops at a desert and decides that this might well be the world's end.  That is, until a camel informs the cat that this is not the world's end and that he will take the feline to the REAL end of the world.  They travel to a grassland and the cat is just about to declare it the world's end when a horse informs him that he is mistaken.  With that, the cat is on the back of the horse going to the REAL end of the world.  From there the cat rides the back of a tiger through a jungle, the back of a whale through the ocean, and finally upon the back of an eagle.  The eagle, wisest of all the creatures yet, simply says, \\"Climb up on my back and I will show you a world without end\\".  Before returning to his home, the cat flies high above the land and we are treated to a magnificent two page spread of animals frolicking on the earth as cat and bird fly silhouetted against a geometric sun.<br /><br />On the final page of this book, author James Rumford explains that he once bought a carved calabash gourd in the shape of a cat.  Looking at the creature, Rumford couldn't help but wonder what other calabash animals his cat might meet and where they might go.  Thus, the calabash cat's tale was born.  The story contains a classic folktale quest, in this case the search for the farthest end of the world.  Rumford has a good ear for repetition and tone.  I'm not fluent in Chadian Arabic (no surprises there) so I can't vouch that the words in that language flow as well as they do in the English.  Needless to say, it nice that they're there at all.<br /><br />The illustrations in this story are modeled on the style of Chad's calabash engravers.  The cat, for his part, has a large lizard and fish bedecking his body.  In fact, each animal that comes with contact with our intrepid hero is illustrated in a similar manner.  Against a brown mottled background, these animals are a beautiful array of black pen and ink, the occasional colored line appears behind them to set the scene.  Therefore, the final rainbow infused shot in the book is a real delight, displaying not only the animals we already met in the story but some others that are wholly original.  My first thought when I saw this illustrations was their similarity to other fine picture books out there.  Books like \\"Rosie's Walk\\" by Pat Hutchins or \\"Drummer Hoff\\" by B. Emberley come to mind.  Like \\"Calabash Cat\\", they too are filled with delicate lines and stoic protagonists.  A storytime containing all three of these books would be an excellent idea, by the way.<br /><br />If you'd like to introduce an African inspired picture book to your repetoire, but you're just so doggone tired of Anase tales, try your hand with this Chad inspired little number.  I can guarantee you've never see anything to quite compare.  From the heady illustrations to the classic nature of its tale, thisis a book to treasure deeply.  West African cats will never look the same again.its tale, this is a book to treasure deeply.  West African cats will never look the same again. <br />	2004-08-20

By hook or by crook I've somehow managed to read quite a few children's books containing fairies, elves, little people, Old Ones, etc. in my day.  From the haunting \\"The Moorchild\\" to the technologically advanced \\"Artemis Fowl\\", I've had the pleasure of witnessing a wide spectrum of intriguing takes on classic sprites.  Yet it wasn't until \\"The Perilous Gard\\" that I read a story that not only presented the Fairy Folk in a realistic way but gave them a historical background as well.  Part historical drama part fantastical romance, \\"The Perilous Gard\\" is an entirely original story with a merry style of its own.<br /><br />Meet Kate Sutton.  Lady-in-waiting to the exiled Princess Elizabeth (future queen) and sister to Alicia Sutton, her flutterbrained little sib.  When Alicia sends a foolish letter to Queen Mary, it is Kate who takes the blame.  She is swiftly banished to the estate of Sir Geoffrey Heron, a kind and noble man with huge tracts of land.  This land was left to him by his dear departed wife and has been referred to as the \\"perilous gard\\".  Many mysteries surround the area.  Rumors speak of wild fairies in the woods and disappearing children.  Left on her own, Kate slowly unravels the mystery of the land and befriends Christopher Heron, younger brother of Geoffrey.  When the boy makes a pact with the People of the Hill, Kate must use all her cleverness and strength to save him from forces she does not yet understand.<br /><br />I loved the use of conspiracy in this book.  Suddenly fairies aren't necessarily the mysterious creatures they usually are.  Instead, they've a pact with the servants of the castle and are willing to use extortion, kidnapping, and bribery to get what they want.  In fact, they're basically human with a few mysterious ways and fun potions at their disposal.  I was especially taken with Kate's explanation of fairies in the first place.  To her mind, the pagans that inhabited Britain were driven underground (literally) with the coming of Christianity.  Therefore, the People of the Hill are merely a race of people desperately trying to hold onto some semblance of their own land.<br /><br />One of the nice things about this book was the personality of the protagonist herself.  Kate's logical sensibilities (she's not exactly a romantic) end up saving both her and those she loves time and time again.  She's a wonderful balance to the crazy things and people around her.  Whenever Christopher goes into a moody pattern of thought, it's Kate that can make him either laugh or growl with her down-to-earth practicalities.  Author Elizabeth Marie Pope is wonderful at creating characters that stick with you.  Alicia, Kate's sister, is such a horrible floozy you wouldn't mind a bit if Kate decided to smother her with a pillow on page 3.  As for the Lady of the Fairy Folk, she meets her match when she decides to go head-to-head with the incomparable Kate Sutton.<br /><br />The heroine of this tale bears more than a passing resemblance to a more recent fantastical tale.  Also containing a hero named Kate, \\"The Hollow Kingdom\\" by Clare Dunkle has more than one similarity to \\"The Perilous Gard\\".  Be that as it may, they are both wonderful tales, and I highly recommend you go out and read them both immediately.  They would pair excellently together.  Definitely consider purchasing them.  \\"The Perilous Gard\\" has never garnered the attention it so rightly deserves, but I feel it's truly coming into its own.

550525:US	49148452	R348B4ZBCYFO9S	0590623826	733416396	The Apple Pie Tree	Books	4	2	3	N	N	MMM mmmm.  Time for pie.	When I was a kid I loved loved loved reading picture books that involved apple pies.  I didn't particularly care for pie in real life, but on the printed page there was no desert more delectable and delicious to read about than scrumptious nummy buttery apple pie.  I had to grow to adulthood before I really grew to appreciate this particular dessert, and I've been devouring them ever since.  Looking back, I was also a big fan (when younger) of the beautiful apple blossom.  For those of you living in Michigan, the apple blossom is the official state flower (a fact remembered almost entirely by elementary teachers and school children).  Looking at Zoe Hall's enjoyable, \\"The Apple Pie Tree\\", a book at combines these two long distant loves, I find myself wishing I could have had this book at my disposal when I was a kid.  A tale that examines the step-by-step process of how apples grow and are later turned into pies, it effectively conveys seasons, growth cycles, and (literally) the birds and the bees.<br /><br />The heroine of this story and her baby sister show the viewer the process that goes into making apple pie.  In the winter, the apple tree that sits in their backyard is bare and bereft of life.  With the advent of Spring, buds turn to leaves and birds build nests in the branches.  Spring means baby birds and apple blossoms covered in bees.  In the summertime the blossoms become small green apples. We watch as the kids play in the sprinkler and the baby birds fly from the tree.  Then, oh joy of joys, the tree is filled with shiny red apples.  These are picked, cored, cut, and piled into a pie shell.  A sprinkling of cinnamon and sugar on top seals the deal and out of the oven pops a delicious apple pie.  And, as our heroine is quick to point out, \\"There's nothing as good as an apple pie you grew yourself\\".<br /><br />For those readers who live in geographic areas that can support apple trees, this might be the perfect book to read before heading out to the nearest orchard and picking a few.  Even those who claim to be cuisinely challenged will find the recipe for apple pie in the back of the book a simple process (though I advise you to buy a crust rather than make one, as the book suggests, if you're inexperienced).  The back of the book also provides a little more information on how exactly bees turn blossoms into apples.  Nothing like a little plant reproduction lesson to sum up a swell story.  This book would read especially well in the fall, since that's the time of year the tale ends with.  Sadly, the story's art is not particularly exceptional.  Using a painted and found-paper collage technique, it gets the message across but doesn't really blow you away.  I found myself wishing idly that Lois Ehlert (of \\"Snowballs\\" fame) had been placed in charge of the illustrations here.  Still, illustrator Shari Halpern does her best and the pictures, while not spectacular, detract from neither the narrative nor the lessons.  They're just a bit dull.<br /><br />This book will not make you crave apple pie if you've never craved it before.  And it will not stun you with its brilliance.  It's just a nice little story about baking, time, and the circle of life (sans that whole icky death part, of course).  If you'd like a colorful picture book for some autumnal reading, this \\"The Apple Pie Tree\\" is probably a sure-fire winner.  I should mention too, that if you DO happen to enjoy the delightful taste sensation that is apple pie, this book WILL make you crave it.  Intensely.  Best read with a piece in your hand for easy reference.nearest orchard and picking a few.

When \\"Messenger\\" was first published there was a bit of an outcry from the children's librarians/educators of the world.  As you may know, this book is the third in the Lowry trilogy that began with her often-banned-but-never-forgotten-classic \\"The Giver\\".  It continued with \\"Gathering Blue\\" and ends here with \\"Messenger\\".  The point of contention comes because depressing suppositions made from the first book now appear to have been wrong all along.  In this third book, it appears that the heroes of the first two books are alive and well.  Go figure!  \\"Messenger\\" stands as a book that ties all three in the series together tightly.  It almost pulls it off too.<br /><br />You may remember Matty from \\"Gathering Blue\\".  Once a dirty gamin with a faithful pup and a dislike of baths, Matty has joined a wonderful community.  In a world where deformity and dissent are punishable by death, a town has arisen that takes in and heals all people in need.  Matty has lived with his blind guardian there for years and the two have grown comfortable together.  Unfortunately, something terrible is happening to the town.  People have begun to trade the deepest depths of their souls in exchange for less important objects and qualities.  There is a growing movement amongst the townsfolk to no longer bring in any outsiders in need.  Greed is devouring the good of the land, and this evil is reflected in the town's nearby forest.  Suddenly Matty is sent on a journey of unknown peril to fetch his guardian's true daughter and bring her safely into the town.  Worse still, the forest is preparing to destroy them.<br /><br />Like the previous books in the trilogy, \\"Messenger\\" has a straightforward writing style that's appealing to read.  This book is part post-apocalyptic, part out-and-out fantasy.  I enjoyed how Lowry presented the xenophobic townspeople.  Having grown comfortable with their homes they traded their best qualities and suddenly started to forget that they themselves (or their parents) had once been in need of sanctuary.  I look at the illegal immigrants that enter America today and see how this complacency and will to detest those in need threatens to destroy our home as well.  Lowry's book is easily applied to a variety of different situations.  This is just one of them.<br /><br />In some ways, however, Lowry has lost her storytelling edge.  The book has a very simple basic plot, one far less encompassing than that of \\"The Giver\\".  Still, I found it a worthy companion to the previous two.  Perhaps the ending is a bit symbolic for my tastes.  Maybe it will depress one or two children here and there.  On the whole, however, it's a great read and one that (to my mind) is as applicable to our daily lives as its predecessors ever were.  Some will like it quite a lot and some will find it a disappointment.  I have found it a slightly flawed wonder and a joy.ir parents) had once been in need of sanctuary.

You know the kinds of books I mean.  These tend to contains plots in which people of different races learn to love one another after undergoing some sort of a trial.  Very few books, as a result, carry this message:  Love your own kind.  Oddly enough the incredibly popular (and oft banned) \\"Blood and Chocolate\\" carries this very lesson at its core.  An alternative message might be:  You can't deny your true self.  Whether or not you agree with what the book says depends greatly on how engaging you find the story.  And it is an interesting little bugger, no question.<br /><br />Vivian's not happy.  A tragic fire killed her father a year ago, and now her mother (partly out of grief) has started flirting with men half her age.  The Five, a group of adolescent boys her age, are completely immature around her and she doesn't have any friends at school.  And then there's that problem with being a werewolf.  Normally it doesn't bother Vivian.  After all, as a member of the loups-garoux, she and her tribe (including the aforementioned mother, Five, and even her dear departed father) keep mostly to themselves.  They mingle with humans to some degree, but soon they'll have to find a place outside of civilization where they can be themselves.  There's mutiny stirring amongst the pack, however.  Without a strong leader factions are struggling to gain control, and no one knows where it will all end.  And then Vivian falls in love with a human boy...<br /><br />The book's a well written fantasy that makes the idea of werewolves just a touch less silly than usual.  Vivian is an uncommonly self-assured young lady.  Often thinking about sex (hence the book's clockwork banning by certain communities) and using her sexuality in a forthright manner, she comes off as someone who knows her own mind.  Not to spoil anything, but Vivian never ACTUALLY makes love to anyone in this book.  Anyone who wishes to ban it, therefore, wants to do so because \\"Blood and Chocolate\\" contains a woman who thinks about sex.  An odd crime to condemn a book for.<br /><br />Vivian's actually not all that sympathetic though.  She begins the tale by acting superior to the humans around her, becomes smug when the object of her affections returns her admiration, and ends up whiny and incapable of a logical decision by the tale's climax.  Otherwise, she's very interesting.  Young adult books rarely contain beautiful self-assured female protagonists.  Those that do tend to be fantasies (like \\"Hollow Kingdom\\" by Clare Dunkle, for example).  So there's a lot to be said for a story in which the heroine isn't constantly fretting over whether or not she's pretty enough or if her boobs are too small.  On the other hand, she kinda dislikable.<br /><br />Good fantasy breaks barriers by speaking beyond the obvious message in the text.  In this particular case, the message here is a bit odd.  Vivian does the wrong thing, learns from her mistake, and is better for it.  I personally found the ending to be a bit perplexing.  Should I never fall in love with people different than myself because I'd never understand them and they'd never understand me?  If you can overlook this somewhat archaic message, the book's a fun read.  It certainly doesn't deserve to be banned.  Mildly ignored from time to time, maybe.  Banned, never.

Sure, we might enjoy flipping through a tale covering the potato famine or the crash of the Hindenburg, but would you really want to experience them first hand yourself?  Not likely.  Author Jim Murphy has always been particularly talented at writing about the disaster genre.  His \\"The Great Fire\\" is one of the finest non-fiction glimpses into the devastating 1871 Chicago conflagration ever produced.  To my mind, however, he seems to make his various projects particularly difficult for himself.  The Great Chicago Fire did not have any photographs to include for interest, though it did contain copious newspaper illustrations and documents.  Such is the case with Murphy's more recent creation, \\"An American Plague\\".  Delving deeply into the Yellow Fever epidemic of the late 18th century, Murphy attempts the near impossible: Make colonial America interesting.  Worse, make colonial American interesting to kids.  And dang it if he doesn't pull it off.<br /><br />Framing the tale as a kind of mystery, Murphy starts slowly.  He introduces us to some of the characters that would become important during the disease's height.  As we read we find ourselves in the hot steamy smelly streets of Philadelphia.  President Washington is having some difficulties with his Proclamation of Neutrality regarding the French.  The Reverend J. Henry C. Helmuth is proclaiming that soon the city will be feeling God's displeasure due to Philly's rampant debauchery.  And in a small boarding house on North Water Street, a French sailor has come down with a fever.  The plague has begun.<br /><br />Murphy's excellent at picking up the pace in this story.  Quickly, the situation escalates from a disease affecting only the poor to one touching a variety of different citizens.  Quick as a wink Washington and his compatriots flee the city and hole up in different areas.  Rich citizens, or those with family not in Philadelphia, get out lickety-split.  Suddenly our focus concentrates on Doctor Benjamin Rush.  Placing himself in constant peril, Rush works tirelessly to find a cure for the disease.  Rich men like Stephen Girard and (gotta love the name) Israel Israel take on the jobs of ministering to the sick and poor.  Most remarkably of all, however, are the members of the Free African Society.  A group of freed blacks, this group is led by the formidable and eloquent Richard Allen and Absalom Jones.  With little regard for their own safety, this group nurses the people of the town when no one else will.  They take on the most disgusting cases and emerge as the real heroes of this tale.  And anyone who thinks the Free African Society got so much as a whisper of thanks for their efforts, by the way, needs to study up on their history a little more.<br /><br />By the book's end Yellow Fever abates with the arrival of autumn.  Though it would pop up periodically over the years, it wasn't until 1900 that the true culprit was discovered.  Tiny mosquitoes were, and remain today to be, the carriers of the disease.  The book ends with the chilling comment that despite years of research, \\"there is still no cure for yellow fever\\".  As Duane Gubler, a director at the Centers for Disease Control notes, yellow fever is, \\"a modern-day time bomb.  We're just sitting here waiting for it to happen\\".  The end!<br /><br />Having successfully turned this book into a tale of true terror (fun!), Murphy had to accompany his words with arresting visual images.  If someone were to offer you your weight in gold if you could come up with five interesting images from 1793, I doubt you'd have much success.  Murphy, however, is cunning.  He begins his chapters with newspaper selections as they were printed during the height of the fever.  He draws upon paintings of the major players (not, interestingly enough, easy ones like Washington).  He even goes so far as to cull prints from other plagues and diseases (like England's Black Plague of 1664) to give the reader some kind of an idea of what the streets of Philadelphia must have resembled.  From early American advertisements (personally my favorite print in the whole book) to political cartoons where Uncle Sam condemns Amos Quito (put the words together) for crimes against humanity, Murphy bends over backwards trying to fill his book with visually engaging scenes and visions.  Be sure to read the book's acknowledgements and note about the illustrations for further fascinating information.<br /><br />If you have a teen that needs to read a non-fiction book from a colonial time period, this book's your best bet.  Honestly, it makes a time period interesting that has forever been buried in dull repeated facts.  Oh, it's still going to bore certain people.  No doubt.  I mean, books of this nature are bound to enthrall only types of kids.  But for those who stick with it and read it through, it's an eye opening look at a disease that couple wipe us out as easily today as it did back then.  And if that doesn't run a finger down your spine, I don't know what will.om other plagues and diseases (like England's Black Plague of 1664) to give the reader some kind of an idea of what the streets of Philadelphia must have resembled.

When you're a kid it's easy to slip into the moods and evocative scenes picture books conjure up.  Books like \\"A Time To Keep\\" by Tasha Tudor leave you feeling nostalgic for a time you never knew.  Books like \\"The Maggie B.\\" sweep you into entirely new safe little enclaves.  When I picked up \\"Tiny's Big Adventure\\", I was immediately entranced by its illustrations.  Regardless of the plot (which is dandy), the visual images in this tale give readers entirely new ways of seeing the world.  Children reading this book will treasure it for life.<br /><br />Tiny the mouse lives with his big sister Katy in a cozy barn.  One day Tiny expresses an interest in the nearby wheat field that stands by their home.  Katy, ever patient and caring, takes her little sib there.  After playing, Tiny (ever ready to flee at the slightest notion) spots various potential threats.  Katy explains to her brother that no, that's a rabbit and not a cat.  No, that's a pheasant and not an owl.  Further reassurances are needed when Tiny stumbles on a snail, a spider, and an old abandoned boot.  Fortunately, Katy is a vastly comforting presence and after playing a little more the two head home.  Completely satisfied with the idea that the world is not as frightening as it may seem, Tiny suggests, \\"Let's do it again, Katy Mouse\\".  And, we are told, they did.<br /><br />I initially took the pictures in this tale to be woodcuts of some sort.  After further inspection, however, I discovered that they are instead made from vinyl engravings, watercolor washes, and printed wood textures.  The result is a particularly classic look awash in a variety of details and colors.  Relying on a sky blue color for images that might otherwise be black, the illustrations deftly lead the reader's eye to various objects.  Katy and Tiny are always drawn in comforting chocolate brown tones while the wheat field is a stunning shade of gold.  There are red bees and a bright orange sun.  These colors meld together effortlessly, yet the feeling you get from the book is still one of age and authority.  You half expect this story to have been written in the early 20th century, it's so beautiful.<br /><br />The story itself isn't too different from your usual preschool fare.  I did enjoy the palpable love felt between the two siblings.  It's always nice to read the occasional book that shows siblings that get along without descending into schmaltzy goo.  This tale is touching without ever striking the reader as playing on their emotions.  All in all, \\"Tiny's Big Adventure\\" is a class act.  If you want a story that will remain a family treasure a little longer than, oh say, \\"Walter the Farting Dog\\", this should be your first choice.  A great gorgeous outing.de of gold.

551069:US	49148452	RXC61H6YU3L5C	0064471861	340715435	Parrot in the Oven: Mi vida	Books	5	22	23	N	N	Oven birds	It's hard to review a book that fairly reeks of excellent prose.  When you encounter a really GOOD writer, the temptation is to read the pretty words and pay little to no attention to the plot.  Victor Martinez fits this category perfectly.  Reading, \\"Parrot in the Oven\\" is difficult if only because the descriptions in the story are pitch perfect every time.  I found myself so continually overwhelmed by the lush characters and interesting metaphors that I would completely forget to pay attention to the narrative and plot.  Fortunately, in the case of this particular book, they were perfectly up to snuff.<br /><br />The tale follows the life and realistic adventures of Mexican-American Manuel Hernandez.  Manuel's a good kid.  He has a slacker older brother, an older sister that flirts with danger, and a baby sibling that doesn't understand the ways of the world just yet.  His father is unemployed leaving him regularly drunk and belligerent.  His mother, not quite up to facing the problems surrounding her, stays by his side despite the effects of his actions on the kids.  But mostly this is Manny's story.  It's a look at a sometimes painful adolescence and the world of classism and racism in which everyone lives.  That and it's a beautiful read.<br /><br />I'll give you a taste of what I'm talking about.  For example, after doing painful yard work with his brother the book reads, \\"When we stopped, finally, the sun was prickling like a hot rash on the back of my neck, and a piece of lava was wedged in my spine.  My brother's face was swollen and burnished as a new penny\\".  Another favorite passage of mine speaks of Manny's sister's friend.  \\"She was in love with Nardo, but he didn't pay her any mind, mostly because blocks of fat sagged on her hips like a belt of thick Bibles\\".  Descriptions like these don't appear out of thin air.  It takes a skilled eye with a sense of humor to come up with such passages.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, it would have been easy for Martinez to rest on his descriptive selections and pay little or no attention to character development and plot.  Fortunately, this is not the case.  While the plot is less a single tale of a boy becoming a man and more a series of significant vignettes in that boy's life, it still is a stunning piece of work.  There are elements of painful realism in this tale, such as Manny's father attempting to shoot his mother in a drunken stupor and his mom defending that same husband to the police moments later.  Characters act stupidly, nobly, or a little bit of both from time to time.  The best way to determine how well you'll understand this story is to read the first chapter.  If you finish it and don't feel that the author is monumentally gifted, you may as well move on and not bother with the rest of the book.  Yet I'm confident when I say that people who don't recognize this book's beauty will be few and far between.<br /><br />Great writing deserves a great audience.  As it is, \\"Parrot in the Oven\\" is supposedly a teen novel.  Don't let that discourage you (especially if you're a teen).  The book is just as deeply satisfying and wonderfully written as any adult book out there today.  After all, they say that if \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" was written today it would be published as a teen novel.  If you're looking for a book that will wow you with its prose, this is the tale to purchase.

551092:US	49148452	R3SZWI4MJNA2EO	0399239545	606821487	"Slowly, Slowly, Slowly," Said the Sloth	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Quick quick, slow slow	Let's say you have a preschool aged child that's a bit slower than his/her peers.  Let's say you've read this child \\"Leo the Late Bloomer\\" umpteen bazillion times, but it just isn't quite the story you've been looking for.  In such a case as this, \\"Slowly, Slowly, Slowly\\", Said the Sloth may be the book for you.  Now let's say that instead you have a child that enjoys picture books about nature.  Let's say this child loves books that present and define the names of a variety of different animals.  In such a case as this, \\"Slowly, Slowly, Slowly\\", Said the Sloth may be the book for you.  Finally, let's say you have a child.  \\"Slowly, Slowly, Slowly\\", Said the Sloth may be the book for you.<br /><br />In this tale, a sloth is minding its business (the gender of the animal is never really defined).  It crawls along a branch of a tree (slowly, slowly, slowly).  It eats a leaf (slowly, slowly, slowly).  You get the idea.  Various animals run, jump, fly, and scurry past the hanging animal occasionally peppering it with questions.  These run along the lines of the practical, \\"Why are you so quiet?\\" to the downright rude, \\"Why are you so boring?\\".  In an act of astounding verbal eloquence and proficiency, the sloth explains itself.  It characterizes itself further as, \\"unflappable, languid, stoic, impassive, sluggish, lethargic, placid, calm, mellow, laid-back and, well, slothful\\".  But as it points out, that's just the way it is.  It likes to do things, \\"slowly, slowly, slowly\\".  Parents unprepared to explain the sloth's interesting vocabulary words would do well to avoid this tale.  Unless you've a ear for definition, you may find yourself in over your head with this particular Carle creation.<br /><br />Clever readers might note that by the time the sloth chooses to answer the animals' questions, no one has hung around long enough to hear the final speech (with the exception of a monkey bounding past).  Little touches such as this save the tale from becoming almost too dull for the preschool reader.  Satisfying the needs of animal obsessed little ones, a lovely display of all the animals in the tale (complete with their names) is provided on the book's endpapers.  For parents, a forward has been written by none other than zoologist extraordinaire Jane Goodall.  This section gives some additional facts on sloths and their habitat.  Though giving some interesting notes on the preferred defecation needs of sloths, Goodall does not happen to mention their mating techniques.  This probably makes it appropriate for reading to those children that want to know more about those two-toed/three-toed members of the South American jungles.  As for the illustrations themselves, they're fine.  I should mention that I'm not the biggest Eric Carle fan in the world.  I can give or take, \\"The Very Hungry Caterpillar\\" and \\"Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?\\" does nothing for me.  The illustrations in this tale are all well and good.  They're a little rough, I might point out.  Carle is getting older these days and his cut outs in this story are more broad and less detailed than his earlier work.  Still, they're colorful and pretty.  Ho hum.<br /><br />Should you find yourself in dire need of a picture book involving sloths, this is undoubtedly your best bet.  A nice little story about how people work on different levels (and how that's a-okay), it gives us a hero who would probably rather take a nap than go on some grand adventure.  You will never see a sloth on the moon or fighting bad guys in B-movies.  If you're fine with a lackadaisical hero, definitely consider this book.  Just be sure to read it slowly, slowly, slowly.too dull for the preschool reader.

551226:US	49148452	R3IFCKCPW10JY	0439372941	194317773	Chasing Vermeer	Books	3	14	19	N	N	Does indeed contain a girl with a pearl earring	I haven't been so torn on a book in a long long time.  \\"Chasing Vermeer\\" is the hot book of the moment.  Kids are snatching it off bookstore and library shelves faster than retailers and librarians can fill them.  The book has been called \\"The DaVinci Code\\" for kids.  It has been compared to such classic children's books as the great \\"Westing Game\\" by Ellen Raskin and the mediocre \\"From the Mixed Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler\\" by E.L. Konigsburg.  It's sweeping the nation and gaining more and more fans with every passing hour.  And honestly?  It's okay.  Merely, simply okay.<br /><br />The tale takes place at the University of Chicago's Laboratory Schools.  A kind of experimental alternative school (where the author Blue Balliett worked as a teacher) the tale follows two students.  Petra Andalee has hair like an Egyptian queen and is good with words.  Calder Pillay is good with puzzles and enjoys playing with his set of twelve pentominoes.  In a series of intricate and increasing coincidences, the two students find themselves called upon to solve the mystery of a painting's disappearance.  A work by the artist Johannes Vermeer entitled, \\"A Lady Writing\\", the kids must figure out where the object has been hidden by using every fact and coincidence they come into contact with.  The only question is, is the thief aware of what they're doing?  Are they putting themselves in danger?  And will they be too late to save \\"The Lady\\" before she vanishes for good?<br /><br />Unlike many mysteries, this book isn't concerned with finding \\"The Lady\\"'s thief.  As a result, the real criminal is a bit of a throwaway character.  The book is instead entirely concerned with where the painting has been hidden.  The story's reliance on coincidences (none of which are explained) may strain the credulity of adult readers.  As for kids, they'll eat it right up.  The book requires the reader to continually decode the messages Calder sends to his friend Tommy in New York.  It even contains a message hidden in some of the illustrations accompanying the story.  For me, decoding this message was my favorite part of the book.  Fans of the Lemony Snicket \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\" will be delighted to see illustrator Brett Helquist lending his talented hand to yet another mystery.  Unfortunately, Helquist comes off looking better than Balliett.<br /><br />To be fair, it's hard to write mysteries for kids.  You either end up writing some form of \\"Encyclopedia Brown\\" stories that take two minutes or you have to rely on gimmicks like Bruce Hale's noirish Chet Gecko books.  This being Balliett's first book, I should be kind.  But it's hard to get around the fact that the writing, aside from the fun coincidences and increasing mystery, is at its root unbelievable.  Because of the theft of a single painting accompanied by a mysterious note, the entire world becomes interested in art.  Bad guys die off without explanation and end up being completely random characters.  The writing in this story is clunky and disjointed.  And there are roughly five million red herrings scattered about this story.  And while I'm ranting (nothing like a good rant to get the blood pressure ah-risin') I might as well add that the opening chapter of this book is suspiciously similar to the aforementioned \\"The Westing Game\\".  Plus the book casually mentions characters that are important to our heroes (like Calder's grandmother) without ever giving them any emotional background or depth.  Maybe my biggest regret with this book was that it was all flashy puzzles and mystery without any substance at all.  This story is chock full of the cardboard cutout bullies and menacing old ladies without any real resolutions.<br /><br />I think Balliett's definitely on the right track.  A little more practice writing for kids and she could really turn out something spectacular.  I just don't think, \\"Chasing Vermeer\\" is going to be known as her best work.  It's very popular and, I admit it freely, a lot of fun.  In the end, however, it won't stand the test of time.  Let's hope the author and illustrator team up in the future to bring the book they're really capable of.  Let's also hope it's a vast improvement.d, I admit it freely, a lot of fun.

Just the same, author Paul Fleischman has excelled at it time and time again.  Long ago when I was young and unappreciative of anything that didn't involve \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" (don't ask...it was a faze) I was given Fleischman's lovely Newbery Award winning, \\"Joyful Noise: Poems for Two Voices\\".  I didn't really take to the book, partly because I was a little old for it when it first came out.  Looking back at it recently, I could acknowledge that it was a lovely idea wrapped up in a succint little book.  Fast forward some thirteen odd years later to the publication of \\"Seek\\".  A particularly daring young adult novel, Fleischman has written a tale that is so flexible that it can either be read on the page or heard in a form of Reader's Theater.  This is perhaps the first book I've read that was meant to be read on the radio.<br /><br />Robert has a happy life in many ways.  Living in San Francisco he shares a home with his adoring mother, grandfather, and grandmother.  He has multiple aunts that dote upon him and a stable home.  Though Robert appreciates these things, it's the absence of his father that affects him the most.  Lenny, Robert's pop, left his mother when he found out that she was pregnant with their child.  Because his father was a radio dj, Robert has a tape of one of Lenny's radio shows.  Using this voice as a guide, the son embarks on a quest to ride the radio waves to find his missing dad.  Covering a scope of many years and tracking Robert's heartbreak and eventual acceptance, the book is written like a radio program.  Songs, snippets of voices from the past, sound effects, fades, crossfades, and other techniques all give the viewer a multi-layered look into one boy's head.<br /><br />Reading this book, I admit right here and now that I was shocked at how mature \\"Seek\\"'s style was.  I thought I was going to read your normal run-of-the-mill teen novel.  Instead, I was caught completely off-guard when I found myself reading \\"We hear a wordless recording of wetland sound effects\\".  From page one you realize that this is not teen drivel.  It takes a bit of maturity and effort to get the feel of the book at the start.  I can guarantee, however, that if you keep going you'll find yourself amply rewarded with a story that is as honest as it is enjoyable.  Authors tend to play with fire when they introduce the parents-split-up-and-child-decided-to-find-one/get-them-back-together plotline.  The danger is always there that the book's going to turn into a treacly (and dishonest) \\"Parent Trap\\" deal where everyone ends up happy nuclear family again by the end.  I knew Fleischman was high on style, but how well can he actually... you know... write?  Well, it turns out that he's superb.  There's life and character to this tale.  There are even (I kid you not) laugh out loud moments.  As a child Rob often puts on a radio show for his family that's hilarious.  As a teen, he's constantly ridiculing people in positions of power, hopefully giving readers some ideas of their own.  And as for Rob's Union grandfather, I'm in love.  I've yet to meet a grandfatherly figure in a book with half the vinegar and personality of that particularly fantastic character.  I'm not going to give away the book's ending or anything.  Let's just say the author of \\"Seek\\" knows what he can and cannot do in this tale.<br /><br />I think the moral of this story is spoken by Rob's mother near the end.  \\"Forgiving doesn't mean you approve of what someone did.  It means you understand why they did it\\".  I think that is, in essence, the gist of what Fleischman's trying to say here.  But just as important as what he says is HOW he chooses to say it.

I watched movies like, \\"The Brave Little Toaster\\" obsessively and was delighted with any book, film, or commercial even that suggested such plotlines.  Yet in all my ramblings I somehow missed the delightful \\"Little Red Lighthouse and the Great Gray Bridge\\".  Chalk it up to the effects of a literary childhood that didn't dwell too deeply on books originally published in the 1940s.  Having had the luck to find this book now, I'm pleased to report that this is an excellent picture book.  Certainly it will have fans that read it as children themselves once upon a time.  But just in case those people wondered if it was good enough to create fans amongst adults who never saw it when they were kids, allow me to put your minds at rest.  It is as fresh today as it ever was.<br /><br />This is one of those tales in which advancements in technology and power are looked upon with a critical eye.  The little red lighthouse sits all by itself at the shore of the Hudson River.  A happy little building, the lighthouse cheerily watches the ships sail past it during the day.  At night the lighthouse keeper arrives and turns on the gas that lights the lighthouse in the dark.  Sometimes, on particularly dangerous nights, a clock in the lighthouse is wound so as to ring a loud iron bell.  Everything's going hunky-dory until one day a group of men arrive and begin digging behind the lighthouse.  Before the lighthouse knows what is happening a gigantic bridge has grown beside the little building, dwarfing it.  This wreaks havoc with the little lighthouse's self-esteem, as you might imagine.  Things don't improve any when the bridge turns on a gigantic beam of light that night.  Then to top it all off the lighthouse keeper doesn't arrive, driving the little red lighthouse into a major funk.  It's only when a dangerous fog overtakes the harbor and the bridge explains its real job (to alert airplanes to its presence) that the little red building realizes that it's just as important as ever.  The books ends with, \\"And every day the people who go up Riverside Drive in New York City turn to look at it.  For there they both are - the great gray bridge and the little red lighthouse.  If you don't believe it, go see for yourself\\".<br /><br />If you're like myself and you don't happen to know every bridge, borough, and beach in the New York City area, then it might be of some interest to you that the great gray bridge is in fact the George Washington Bridge.  Having never seen it, I can't guarantee that the little lighthouse is still there.  Still, the story inspired by it is a lovely piece of work.  The plot has some similarities to \\"Mike Mulligan\\" since it deals with old buildings/machines facing obsolescence of one sort or another.  Kids reading this story may enjoy the lengthy descriptions of ships given space here.  They may also feel a bit of sympathy on a personal level with the small lighthouse that must sit in the shadow the gigantic bridge.<br /><br />The plot, however, could have been saved or destroyed by the illustrations.  In this particular case some benevolent god decided to give Lynd Ward the chance to draw for this tale.  Choosing a style that could only seriously be described as, \\"inspired\\", Ward draws every building, boat, and person with great realism.  Though the lighthouse is completely capable of showing such emotions as pride, surprise, and downright misery, it always does so while looking like a real building.  Ward doesn't slap some cartoony eyes and facial features on otherwise accurate inanimate objects.  If a steamer is going to say hello then it's eyes will be windows and its mouth a grand deck.  If the great gray bridge is going to discuss the nature of its existence its mouth will be the space between its cables and its eyes the points where the cables connect to the towers.  Best of all, Ward uses only four colors or so (black, white, red, and blue) yet suggests entirely different shades and tones with his drawing style.  The result is a book that looks as good as it sounds.<br /><br />Some older picture books tend to age very badly as time goes on.  They either rely on old-fashioned \\"values\\" and techniques or they bog themselves down with affected styles.  In the case of \\"The Little Red Lighthouse and the Great Gray Bridge\\", the book fits in beautifully with its picture book brothers and sisters today.  I suspect that hundreds or even thousands of books have tried to copy the style that this book made so famous.  All that is well and good, but the original story is well worth looking up on its own merits alone.

Having heard that this book was flying from shelves across the country, garnering the love and respect of thousands of children every day, I thought I'd check it out myself.  It's very rare that a non-fiction book becomes overwhelmingly accepted by kids.  But when it happens, watch out!  It might be all you can do to keep the l'il buggers from reading it day and night and day again.<br /><br />The book is a clever look at the wide variety of sharks living in ocean waters today.  From the tiny sixteen inch cookie-cutter shark (which wins my love on name alone) to the vast twenty-nine foot six inch basking shark, this book has `em all.  It includes a variety of amusing factoids in its text, providing copious amounts of useful information.  In a well drawn graphic section, the book examines the common properties that all sharks share, both inside and outside the body.  Kids reading this book learn about the different parts of the shark and why they're so awfully dangerous.  Most interestingly of all, the book makes it perfectly clear that while sharks do kill an average six people a year, people kill an average 100 MILLION sharks a year. The book finishes up with an index of all the sharks in the text (for kids' easy referencing) as well as a bit of shark history to boot.<br /><br />I was a little sad that author Nicola Davies didn't give any space to a bibliography of sources kids could use to find out more about sharks and their ways.  Still, that's small potatoes.  Davies certainly seems to have plumbed every last bit of interesting information about sharks she could find.  I mean, who knew that the gel-filled pits in a sharks nose detect the electrical messages in a prey's body?  Or that latern sharks have light making organs that help them blend into the silvery surface of the water around them?  News to me!  Illustrator James Croft gives the book an easy-going cartoonish feel that doesn't particularly add much to the book, but neither does it detract.  The book's brightly colored and amusing.  Just not particularly original in that respect.<br /><br />If you need a good non-fiction picture book that'll give some of the more scientifically minded kiddies the thrills they seek (and frankly, what kid isn't interested in man-eating animals with big nasty teeth?) \\"Surprising Sharks\\" is your best bet.  It's not gory, but it'll certain give some kids the thrill of fear they seek in their non-fic lit.

561143:US	49148452	R11WWN7W8T790E	0440484839	12674303	Taran Wanderer (Pyrdain Chronicles)	Books	3	8	17	N	N	I am, I said.  To no one there.	The Prydain series takes a turn for the introspective with this particular book in the series.  Throughout the series our hero, Taran, has been sort of an everyboy.  He's never physically described in the books, a fact I've always ascribed to the notion that the guys reading the books can picture him as themselves.  Up until \\"Taran Wanderer\\", the boy's been alternately foolish and brave.  In this particular adventure, however, author Lloyd Alexander decides to do an old fashioned boy-learning-to-be-a-man storyline.  Though the writing is fairly fine, in the end this stands as probably one of the weaker books in the Prydain series.<br /><br />As the book opens, we see Taran attempting to come to grips with two things.  On the one hand, he has decided that he loves Eilonwy.  On the other hand, he wants to know who he parents are.  Unfortunately for the reader, Eilonwy remains in this story only as a pretty memory in Taran's mind.  She never actually appears in the narrative.  That leaves the parentage quest.  Taran has decided that he is probably descended from noble lineage.  Now, you might think this to be a pretty egotistical idea on Taran's part.  But when you consider that roughly 50% of the people Taran comes into contact with in his adventures are either kings, princesses, or princes, it's not that crazy a notion.  This series is rife with royalty.  Setting off away from his beloved Caer Dalben with the faithful Gurgi in tow, Taran goes to find his destiny.  What he finds instead is who he is as a person.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, Eilonwy is missing from this book, and this is a serious failing.  With Taran lovestruck and doe-eyed, the girl's caustic wit and good sense are sorely lacking.  We get plenty of adorable Gurgi and funny Fflewddur and even a bit of Dolbi, but Eilonwy's space cannot be filled.  The fact of the matter is, she always used to temper Taran's melodramatic musings and monologues.  With her gone, Taran launches into huge bouts of self-pity and depression without respite.  Other small flaws concern the finish of the tale.  Though the ending is meant to give the reader an important, rather than easy, finale, it comes off as slightly disappointing.  That's the problem with a book that's supposed to be \\"meaningful\\".  If you haven't a good sense of humor and ability to laugh at yourself, what good are you to the reader?  Taran's so doggone EARNEST all the time.  You just wanna slap the little guy and tell him to lighten up.  I'm sure Eilonwy would.  If she were around.<br /><br />Though the action and swashbuckling abound in this tale, it's not the same.  I was disappointed in this particular installment.  I'm certain it has its admirers, and certainly it's a fine book.  The fact that it doesn't live up to its fellow books in the series doesn't mean it isn't worthy reading.

561179:US	49148452	R2CXC53MTW3ULN	0316666033	224813157	It's Okay To Be Different	Books	2	56	104	N	N	It's okay not to like this book	Like most children of my generation, the phrase, \\"It's okay to be different\\" conjures up a very distinct image.  Though he may not have used those exact words, Mr. Rogers (of PBS's \\"Mr. Roger's Neighborhood\\" fame) often spoke to kids, reassuring them in words of that nature.  He was a counselor for kids everywhere and when he said, \\"You are special\\" you believed it.  It's funny, but while Todd Parr's 2001 publication, \\"It's Okay to Be Different\\" covers the same ground that Mr. Rogers did, his book is less successful.  Maybe I've grown old and sour in my late 20s, but after reading through this picture book I couldn't help but feel it went about its message in a roundabout way.  It's a worthy message.  But definitely roundabout.<br /><br />The book displays a series of brightly colored characters smiling for the viewer while displaying why they are \\"okay\\".  For example, a blind woman with her dog has a caption that reads, \\"It's okay to need some help\\".  A very tall woman is told, \\"It's okay to be extra large\\".  And a child sitting in the bathtub with a blue bowl of some orange material is accompanied by, \\"It's okay to eat macaroni and cheese in the bathtub\\".  The \\"It's okay\\" statements range from the serious (\\"It's okay to say NO to bad things\\") to the silly (\\"It's okay to have a pet worm\\").  The illustrations in this story are purposefully simplistic.  They're little more than stick figures, albeit incredibly brightly colored stick figures.<br /><br />I have no problem with the art in this book.  I liked the colors, though I did have to wonder why the \\"It's okay to be adopted\\" picture was of a big brown dog carrying a smaller dog in a kangaroo-like pouch.  It's possible that the big dog is supposed to be a kangaroo, but if so it's a bit of a stretch.  All that aside, I liked the style of the illustrations.  It was the message I didn't quite get.  First off, the term \\"it's okay\\" sort of suggests that while \\"it\\" may not be great, it's \\"okay\\" at least.  Also, there are some really serious \\"okay\\" messages being conveyed here next to rather bizarre ones.  I appreciate the silliness that includes the \\"It's okay to have a pet worm\\" message.  But if a kid believes that, and is told by his or her parent that, in fact, it is NOT okay to have a pet worm, why is that kid going to believe that \\"It's okay to be adopted\\"?  The fact of the matter is, some of these statements are going to be untrue depending on the family (like the aforementioned macaroni and cheese in the bathtub line), thereby negating all other statements as well.  I guess what I'm trying to say it, author/illustrator Todd Parr decided to send mixed messages when he included fake \\"It's okay\\" lines with real ones.<br /><br />That and the book's insipid.  I mean, there are a lot of really good \\"It's okay\\" books out there that give the same messages as this one with a lot less goo.  If you want this message in crackling high energy form, just read your kids the collected works of Dr. Seuss.  There you get a lot of the same messages, but with a sly understated wit and intelligence lacking here.  You can definitely point out that I'm being pretty harsh to a mere picture book.  But to me there is no such thing as \\"mere\\" picture books.  Anything you give your kids to read should be high quality and well written.  Why give them second rate reading materials when great books exist out there, just waiting for them?  In the end, \\"It's Okay to Be Different\\", means well but doesn't live up to expectations.  It is, as I said, second rate Mr. Rogers material.  Though utterly inoffensive it is also utterly bland.  Colorful.  But bland.  Go out and get better books for your kids.

Sometimes they learn about it through literature (I credit, \\"The Adventures of Cavalier and Clay\\"), through song and story, or through children's books.  David Wisniewski was not the first author/illustrator to create a picture book out of the myth of the man of clay.  He was only the best.<br /><br />In this tale, four hundred years ago the Jews of Prague were sorely oppressed.  They had been oppressed in the past, it's true, but new evil rumors were being passed on about them.  People were telling the \\"Blood Lie\\", which claimed that Jews were guilty of mixing the blood of Christian children with the flour and water of matzoh.  Amongst these Jews lived the chief rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel.  One night, in a dream, Loew was commanded by God to create a Golem.  Obeying the command, Loew built a man out of clay and gave it life.  The Golem, unofficially named Joseph, was sent to discover the men spreading the Blood Lie about the Jews and bring them to justice.  When the Golem was successful at this endeavor an angry mob of enemies of the Jews set upon the ghetto to wreak massive destruction.  Instead, the Golem protected the Jews and the emperor of Prague vowed never to let such a thing happen again.  With that, the Golem's life was taken (much to his chagrin) only to be called back again if the Jews ever found themselves in trouble once more.<br /><br />David Wisniewski provides and lengthy and incredibly in depth note at the end of this tale outlining the history of the legend as well as the history of the Jews themselves.  You cannot help but be impressed by the depth and intensity of Wisniewski's research.  As a writer he deftly tells the Golem's tale, even mentioning how the creature grew to love life.  It is a truly sad moment indeed when Rabbi Loew chooses to dissolve his creature once the Jews are finally safe.  The Golem's pleas for life go unheeded, and the Rabbi even goes so far as to inform his poor servant that when he is dead he will not remember anything of life since he is merely clay.  It's a harsh moment for a picture book, but I greatly appreciate Wisniewski's decision to tell the story without Disneyesque changes.  But a tale can only go so far on its own.  As the 1997 Caldecott award winner, \\"Golem\\" had to be as visually interesting as it was well told.  The fact of the matter is that the artistic quality of this story is breathtaking.  The cut paper illustrations used in this story are beyond anything I've seen in a long time.  From the tiniest cracks found in the earth to the crackles of lightning that fills the Golem's coarse clay and bring him to life, Wisniewski is a detailed and magnificent artist.  I can say with little doubt that this book is perhaps the most beautiful cut paper tale ever produced for children.<br /><br />I don't know enough about the original Golem tale to tell you whether or not Wisniewski is accurate in his interpretation.  All I can say is that this book deserves to be read.  We do not usually find such thoughtful beauty in our picture books.  When we do we should catch ahold of them and love them dearly.

These stories are usually based on the lives of the relatives and ancestors of the authors.  \\"Peppe the Lamplighter\\" is no exception.  Loosely based on the grandfather of author Elisa Bartone, the book examines one boy's occupation and his struggle be accepted in the eyes of his father.<br /><br />Peppe lives with his sick father and seven sisters (not including the one in Naples) in the section of New York known as Little Italy.  Taking place in what looks to be the 1910s, Peppe moves from store to store, attempting to find work.  His father, is too sick to work himself, and all the children in the family must strive to find some kind of money.  One day, old Domenico the lamplighter asks Peppe if he would light the lamps for him while he returns to Italy to fetch his wife.  Peppe agrees readily and is delighted with the prospect.  Delight slowly sours to shame, however, when his father is horrified by the job.  Says he, \\"Did I come to America for my son to light the streetlamps?\\".  As time goes by, Peppe's disenchantment with the job grows until he doesn't light the lamps at all.  Only through the discovery of how important his job is to others can Peppe find the strength to return to lighting the lamps of New York City.<br /><br />The pictures in this book are wonderfully rendered.  Here we find the New York City tenements in all their filthy glory.  At the same time, we see the strength of the people living in them.  The first painting in the book shows Peppe and his family staring at the viewer as if they were posing for a formal family photograph.  The light from a single latern lights them all, and illustrator Ted Lewin shows off his talents.  In many ways, the book is similar to Chris K. Soentpiet's style (of \\"Molly Bannaky\\" fame).  Reading this book is to actually find yourself in early New York itself.  Crowds come alive and individuals display a wide range of emotions.  The best picture in the whole book, to my mind, is the image of Peppe lifting his little sister so that she can light the lamp on the street herself.  The light is above them, illuminating their faces with incredibly intensity.  The two stare up at it, entranced.<br /><br />The story itself if good, if not overwhelming.  Peppe's father has a somewhat unbelievable change of heart towards the end of the tale.  For a man who has harbored so much bitterness towards his son's chosen profession, he seems to come around to it mighty fast when the mood calls for it.  Otherwise, it's lovely.  Peppe compares the lighting of the lamps to the lighting of candles at Mass, and even goes so far as to say a small prayer for each.  Small details like this truly bring the story to life.<br /><br />The book celebrates one small boy who can, in his sister Assunta's words, \\"scare the dark away\\".  It is a book about how every human being, if they've a mind to, can bring light into the world in their own humble fashion.  Peppe may only be a lamplighter, but even his father recognizes by the end that this honest job gives safety and comfort to others.  We should all be so lucky as to have jobs that do half as much.als display a wide range of emotions.

If you've ever known a librarian personally (everyone should be so lucky) then you know that this particular profession is obsessed with itself.  Librarians love to seek out librarian related movies (\\"Party Girl\\", for example), music (Tori Amos's, \\"Songs of the Librarian\\"), and best of all... books!  So when Sarah Stewart sat down and wrote a book entitled, \\"The Library\\", she basically guaranteed that it would be a success with at least one group of people in the world.  Fortunately, the book is a hit with another group as well.  Kids.<br /><br />Our heroine is Elizabeth Brown and our heroine's method of entering the story is to fall from the sky into her mother's outstretched laundry linen.  Says the text, \\"Elizabeth Brown/ Entered the world/ Dropping straight down from the sky/ Elizabeth Brown/ Entered the world/ Skinny, nearsighted, and shy\\".  From the beginning the girl is an avid reader.  With her constant companions at her side (a stuffed teddy bear and a continually serene housecat) we watch as Elizabeth Brown goes to school and breaks her own bunk bed with the weight of her books.  She lends them to friends and eschews the lure of the opposite sex.  Older still, she starts tutoring and lives on her own, reading all the while.  Then one day there's no denying it any longer.  \\"She had to face the awful fact\\".  There are just too many books in the house.  Without further ado her house becomes a library and she moves in with a female friend.  To the end of their days they continue to read, \\"And turned page... after page... after page\\".<br /><br />For readers (especially shy nearsighted ones) who have turned their lives over wholeheartedly to the reading of literature, this book is the ultimate compliment.  As a Horn Book Magazine review once said, it shows a woman, \\"whose life is graceful and meaningful\\".  Reading it myself, I love it.  No question.  But there is that nagging little voice at the back of my head that questions whether or not Elizabeth Brown did, in fact, lead a \\"meaningful\\" life.  I suppose she did in the sense that she brought books to other people by opening her library.  But her own life was, in a sense, squandered in books.  Though she did have a friend at the end, she had no close relationships or fellow human companionship for quite some time.  Then again, it's a good children's book that makes you ponder the meaning of what constitutes a rich and full life.  Such big questions for such small packages.<br /><br />As for the illustrations by David Small... they are without fault.  I've read a lot of David Small books in my day, and to my mind this one is his best work in terms of skill.  I've heard mumbles in the bookselling community that Small (married to the book's author Sarah Stewart) tends to make her the star of his illustrations on a regular basis.  Just check out \\"The Money Tree\\" if you don't believe me.  In this case, Small's somewhat choppy style has been tamed and given a great deal of depth and feeling.  There are tiny evocative details in this story that charm as often as they impress.  In a section that describes the seasons, a small blue colored bird grasps a flowering tree's branch between its little clawed feet.  Delicate line drawings of leaves and snowflakes fall on either side of the text.  And on each and every page the corners of the illustrations are held within beautiful cornerpieces.  For kids, there's the added fun of trying to find Elizabeth Brown's teddy bear and cat in almost every illustration.<br /><br />The book takes a love of reading to a safe extreme.  It teaches children the joy of the process while, at the same time, being a fun and friendly book in and of itself.  It's a little peculiar to read a book about reading (especially if you're a child) but I don't think they'll mind.  In the end, it's so filled with a love of literature that even the most die hard television couch potato who happens to see itwill be charmed.  Altogether, a wonderful little work.ens to see it will be charmed.  Altogether, a wonderful little work. <br />	2004-08-09

Since its publication, \\"Johnny Tremain\\" has remained one of the best known children's books ever written.  It won the 1944 Newbery Award and is still read by schoolchildren everywhere.  Heck, even Bart Simpson was lured into reading it in a \\"Simpsons\\" episode (Marge tells him that it's about a boy with a deformed hand and he' intrigued).  Newbery award winners come and go.  Sometimes they're remembered (ala \\"Caddie Woodlawn\\") and sometimes they're rightfully forgotten (ala \\"Daniel Boone\\").  \\"Johnny Tremain\\" is different because even reading it today the book remains readable, thoughtful, and interesting.  It deserves its praise.<br /><br />Johnny Tremain is an apprenticed silversmith of one Mr. Lapham.  Unusually skilled in the trade, Johnny's the star of the household.  The other apprentices envy and hate him and the members of the Lapham family love him.  Just the same, Johnny is unaccountably vain.  Boastful and overflowing with pride, he lords his superior abilities over everyone he meets, even catching the eye of the greatest silversmith in Boston, Paul Revere.  Yet when a broken crucible maims Johnny's hand with silver, the life he had planned for himself can never be.  Desperate for work, he finally finds a place with the Boston Observer, a Whig news publication.  Soon Johnny finds himself rubbing shoulders with the men of the Revolution.  His life becomes enmeshed in the spy networks and fighting words that lead up to the American Revolution.  In doing so, he becomes a major player in the creation of a new America.<br /><br />I read this book in elementary school and, sadly, remembered very little of it.  What I did remember was Johnny's hand.  Honestly, I think this book would sell like hotcakes if it was retitled, \\"Johnny Tremain: The Boy With the Deformed Hand\\".  Not that I'm seriously recommending the change.  What really struck me, when reading this book again today, was just how well written the little bugger is.  First of all, it begins with an unsympathetic protagonist.  Up till now, most Newbery protagonists fell somewhere between saints and perfection incarnate.  But Johnny is just the kind of little snot who needs to be taken down a peg to become a better person.  This isn't one of those books where the hero gets hurt and suddenly makes a miraculous transformation from bad to good either.  As you read the story you see Johnny's progress. He grows and learns from his injury, yes, but he also grows and learns from meeting and speaking with other people.  Which brings me to the second remarkable aspect of this book.  The English, awful as they are sometimes, are not evil cackling villains.  Johnny meets and even, to some  extent, befriends British officers.  He finds himself pitying the English wounded and sympathizing with their pain.  Likewise, not all the American Revolutionaries are perfect gods.  John Hancock comes off as a bit of a rich fop, and Sam Adams is seen gleefully rubbing his hands together over the prospect of upcoming destruction.  So many stories create villains so ridiculously evil that they haven't a single solitary redeeming characteristic and heroes pious to the point of sainthood.  \\"Johnny Tremain\\" could easily have fallen into that trap, but it doesn't.  Instead, it gives a remarkably thoughtful approach to the nature of enemies, war, and freedom.<br /><br />The book is long, granted.  Also, there are numerous spying/battle sections in which I had to continually backtrack through the text to figure out, \\"Now why is Johnny doing that?\\".  The best way to lure kids today with this book might be to sell it as a Revolutionary spy book.  I mean, Johnny really does become a kind of secret agent for the Yankees.  He knows how to get information out of people and how to find out important English secrets.  Best of all, the story has a naturalisticwriting style that's easy to get through once you get going.  If you want to give your kids a Newbery award winner that's as memorable and fascinating today as it was the day it was written, I cannot recommend, \\"Johnny Tremain\\" enough.  Ignore the picture of the saintly boy on the cover.  This is a book of adventure, pride, and war.turalistic writing style that's easy to get through once you get going.

561262:US	49148452	R2VEKM2ZJ2LJ0M	0060007281	745683519	A Fine, Fine School	Books	4	1	4	N	N	Fine as fish hair	The pairing of children's author superstar Sharon Creech (Newbery winner \\"Walk Two Moons\\" anyone?) and New Yorker cartoonist Harry Bliss (the modern equivalent of Margaret Bloy Graham of \\"Harry the Dirty Dog\\" fame) was not an intuitive one.  It was not a given that these two wunderkinds would find one another and produce, for the world, \\"A Fine, Fine School\\".  It was even less of a given that the book would turn out to be as good as it was.  It's just nice that it worked out that way.<br /><br />We are introduced to the bespectacled Tillie, her oddly unnamed toddler brother, and her dog Beans.  We are also introduced to Mr. Keene, the kind of guy whose first name is probably \\"Peachy\\".  Mr. Keene is the principal of Tillie's school and he is just overwhelmed with delight at his fine children, their fine teachers (no winking), and the fine fine school they all work and learn in.  Mr. Keene is so delighted, in fact, that one day he calls all the students and teachers together and proposes that the school be open on Saturdays too.  The kids and teacher are, needless to say, not thrilled with this notion.  Mr. Keene has apparently never heard of there being too much of a good thing, so he quickly makes Sundays mandatory school days as well.  Next, holidays are abandoned, making this the first picture book I have ever seen containing the phrase, \\"Easter Schmeaster\\".  Finally (amid much rending of hair, tears, and lapses into unconsciousness), Mr. Keene declares the summer to be a time of learning as well.  Tillie, for her part, has been unable to help her little brother learn and play.  It's up to her to explain, kindly, to the cheery Mr. Keene the flaws in his delightful plans.<br /><br />The story, in and of itself, is fine.  I mean, it's a novel idea to have a sympathetic principal character who does increasingly well-intentioned but blundering things.  Also, this is the first children's book I read where the children have to take summer school because they're doing so WELL.  Honestly, however, there's not much to say about the plot.  I like Sharon Creech, but nothing in this storyline really blows me away.  Harry Bliss's illustrations on the other hand...<br /><br />Now, I should preface this a little.  I grew up reading a heckuva lot of Steven Kellogg growing up.  I was entranced with any picture book artist that could slip a million tiny details into an illustration that would later be found and poured over by children worldwide.  I continue to be entranced by such artists to this very day, and Harry Bliss has become one of my new favorites.  Under his guidance this fine fine school moves from simply being okay to becoming fabulous.  Kids in it read books like, \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" and \\"Pleasing the Ghost\\".  They define words like \\"futurism\\" and \\"cubism\\" and construct nine feet tall dinosaurs out of paper mache.  In Bliss's world the dog Beans is near human, reading New York Times articles on Al Hirschfeld and drinking coffee.  Heck, every picture in this book has a million different little details and delights to discover.  Mr. Keene is the ultimate happy-go-lucky guy.  The kind of fellow so nice and sweet that no one has the heart to actually come out and say that school on week-ends, holidays, and in the summer might be a bad idea.  And when he announces that school will no longer fall on those days, Bliss taps into the joy and energy kids feel on the last day of school.  There's a whole lot of joy going on in this book's finish.<br /><br />The best way to tell if this is the kind of book your kid will enjoy is to flip through it yourself.  Just take a look at the illustrations for a moment.  Spend some time with this tale. If you don't find yourself charmed and delighted after a few minutes of sifting through it then this book will probably do nothing for you or your child.  But if you find yourself intrigued and delighted, snatch it up tout suite and give it to a child who'll appreciate it.  This is a book that understands the worthiness of school, and the ecstasy of not having to go.t understands the worthiness of school, and the ecstasy of not having to go. <br />	2004-08-09

Yet when you think about it... it makes sense.  The best children's books are the ones that can explain awful circumstances in a way that kids can understand.  Just as the 2004 Caldecott Award winner \\"The Man Who Walked Between the Towers\\" tips its hat to September 11th, \\"Smoky Night\\" was inspired by the L.A. riots.  According to the bookflap, author Even Bunting wondered what riots meant to the children that lived through them.  Through this tale, Bunting shows the good that can come out of hard times and struggles.<br /><br />When the book begins, young Daniel and his mom are watching the people rioting in the street below.  Daniel is confused by this, and rightly so.  These people are taking an odd joy in what they do.  Even as they destroy and steal they act happy with what they're doing.  Says Daniel, \\"I've never heard anybody laugh the way they laugh\\".  That night Daniel is woken up out of his bed by the shaking of his mother.  The apartment building is on fire, and the boy cannot locate his pet cat Jasmine.  In the panic he's forced to leave without her and stay in a shelter that night with his mom.  Mrs. Kim, a neighbor of Daniel, is missing her cat as well.  Suddenly a fire fighter enters the building, both cats under his arms.  Where once the cats used to fight one another, now there is a bond between them.  A similar attempt to make peace with Mrs. Kim ends with pleasing results.<br /><br />The story doesn't strike you as particularly moving at first.  You need to read it and digest it a while to get the full flavor of the text.  When I first read through the tale I felt disappointed.  A little let down.  Then I thought about what I read and went back to it.  The inclusion of the cats is really what lets this story work as well as it does.  I also appreciated how the tale acknowledged the dark side of human beings.  Though it's clear that Daniel and his mother are not \\"bad people\\", he notes that the reason he and his mother do not shop at the story of Mrs. Kim is that, \\"Mama says it's better if we buy from our own people\\".  This chilling statement is somewhat rectified by the end, but just barely.  I was grateful that this didn't turn out to be a throwaway line.<br /><br />The illustrations for this book, provided by the multi-talented Daid Diaz, work exceedingly well.  The thick heavily stylized drawing style of Diaz is contrasted with a kind of multi-media pairing with photographs.  If you've ever read Kathleen Krull's remarkable, \\"Wilma Unlimited\\" then you'll know what I'm talking about.  For example, when we see Mrs. Kim unhappily trying to stop people from stealing her store's goods, the photograph behind the illustration is a sidewalk covered in scattered dry goods.  Underneath the nuts and dried fruits you can just make out the childlike chalk drawings, possibly made earlier in the day.  Tiny impossible details like this one fill the text.  It's remarkable.<br /><br />Some people may feel this book is racist because it doesn't explain the motivations behind the rioters.  Well, it does mention the anger the rioters feel but to a child the simple fact that people are stealing from one another is a bad thing.  Also, I might point out that Daniel and his mother are black.  If you find racism in this book, it's probably because you hope to find it.<br /><br />What I suggest is this:  First, read this book to yourself.  Think it through.  Ponder it a couple times.  Then read it to your child/children.  Let them think it through.  Let them ponder it a couple times.  Then read it together to get the full flavor of the text.  Answer the children's questions.  Try to find answers that are honest but not too upsetting.  Then, when they've gone to bed, read it book one more time to yourself.  Savor it.

561652:US	49148452	R21T3D86SM4CRR	0141301155	959905089	Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (My Roald Dahl)	Books	4	5	5	N	N	It makes the world taste good	Sometimes I wonder what the ratio of children who read this book before seeing the movie \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" is to children who saw the movie before reading the book.  In my own personal case, I first met with the works of Roald Dahl by watching the movie in my elementary school.  The scene where Violet blows up like a blueberry haunts my nightmares to this day, I might add.  It was only after I saw the film that I began to wonder about the book.  Was it better?  Worse?  About the same?  So I picked it up, read it through, and found it to be an entirely different beastie than the film altogether.  I shouldn't have been surprised, I suppose, but I was.  Though there's an underlying creepiness to both the film and the book, the book also has a wide-eyed innocence about it that is virtually impossible to capture on the silver screen.  Reading the book yet again today I am amazed by the story's capacity to reach into the minds of children and display before their wondering eyes a tale that praises the one item all kids love and all adults once coveted:  CANDY.<br /><br />Charlie Bucket lives with his mother, father, and four grandparents in a shoddy shack on the edge of town.  The family is ridiculously poor and there is little money available for such treats as candy or chocolate.  This is especially unfortunate for Charlie because he loves the stuff.  Worse still (or better, depending on how you look at it), Charlie lives in the same town as the fabulous Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory.  One day, the owner of the factory, the mysterious Willy Wonka, offers a contest for the children of the world.  He has hidden five golden tickets in some of his candy bars.  Those lucky people who find the tickets will get a special tour of the chocolate factory (a place where no one's allowed in or out under normal circumstances) and a lifetime supply of chocolate.  Four absolutely horrid children find the tickets first and then, by a stroke of providence, Charlie finds one himself.  With his Grandpa Joe in tow the two join the other kids and parents as they take a wild ride within the marvelous chocolate factory itself.<br /><br />If nothing else, Dahl taps into the best possible candy ideas an author has ever concocted.  Author J.K. Rowling has come up with some pretty cool candies, it's true.  But for sheer breadth and imagination, Dahl cannot be beat.  This book contains everything from hot ice creams for cold days to cavity-filling caramels (\\"no more dentists\\").  In his typically ridiculous fashion the villains of the piece are one and all horrid to the end.  Of course, of the different sins each child exhibits, the sin of chewing gum is probably the oddest.  I can only assume it was added to the crew because the plot takes place in a candy factory and it's a convenient flaw to exploit.  Just the same, wouldn't picking your nose be worse?  And lead to all sorts of amusing punishments?<br /><br />The cruelty of the book is there, true.  But unlike the movie, the kids in this story definitely leave the plant alive and, if not well, at least wiser.  Willy Wonka himself is endowed with a kind of delightful naivet&eacute;.  He honestly tries to stop each child before he or she does something stupid and/or dangerous.  Charlie himself is sort of an Oliver Twist type, complete with a saintly demeanor and countenance.  All in all, I found the whole book to be great.  I do wish I hadn't seen the movie first, but sometimes things like that are just unavoidable.<br /><br />Now, if you're going to read a version of this tale, I highly suggest that you do NOT get the original 1964 edition.  This was the version I read recently and boy oh boy do those Oompa-Loompas catch you by surprise.  In the original version they were black pigmies from the, \\"deepest and darkest part of the African jungle where no white man had ever been before\\".  Even the illustrations (originally created by Joseph Schindelman) show a variety of happy laughing pigmies.  Someone must have complained to Mr. Dahl though, because if you look at the 1973 reprint, all the Oompa-Loompas have been magically transformed from black pigmies to small white hippies.  Entire sections of the book have been rewritten, including an entirely new section talking about \\"hornswogglers\\" and \\"snozzwangers\\" which never appeared in the original book.  Now, of course, the illustrator of choice is the illustrious Quentin Blake.  His pictures contain wholly different images of the Oompa-Loompas and the new text has been kept.  Better yet, the newest edition of \\"Charlie\\" has an interview with Mr. Dahl at the back of the book.  Be sure to read the part where he talks about how the 1930s were the \\"glorious and golden decade\\" of chocolate.  I can't vouch that this section exists in the paperback edition, however.  Only the hardcover version with the chocolate colored cover.<br /><br />In the end, what you get out of \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" depends on what you put into it.  If you go into this book expecting some sort of novelization of the film, you're going to end up sorely disappointed.  If instead, however, you go in hoping for a book that effectively makes every reader's mouth water for Wonka's fabulous creamy candies and has a pretty good story to boot, go no further.  It's a great story with a delightful dark side that kids will love and certain kids of adults will hate.  A true children's classic.ng pigmies.

Never.  This book first came to my attention when I heard that it was one of those great \\"lost\\" children's books.  I mean, roughly 5 bazillion picture books are published every year, so one or two good ones are bound to slip through the cracks here and there.  Naturally curious, I plucked it and discovered that it is perhaps one of the most original stories I have ever had the pleasure to see.  Though not without its flaws, it gives Columbus the drubbing he so rightfully deserves.  I only wish it could be better known.<br /><br />In this tale, told in an easygoing vernacular, we read that Coyote created the world.  She (love it!) created both good (rainbows, flowers, clouds) and bad (prune juice, commercials, Columbus himself) things.  But what Coyote loved more than anything else was to play baseball.  Most of the animals Coyote creates aren't keen on the idea of playing, but the human beings enjoy the game.  Unfortunately, Coyote always cheats and always changes the rules.  Pretty soon she has no one to play with again and in her distraction and boredom she doesn't see the things that are created out of her head.  Before she knows it the Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria are knocking on the door and some funny looking people are coming aboard.  Coyote can't get these fellows to play ball either, they're so busy looking for stuff to sell.  Next thing you know they've captured the people already living on the land and are selling them for a profit back in Spain.  Coyote tries to fix everything but when she tries to do so (her nose tends to fall off when she's trying hard) suddenly there's Jacques Cartier and a whole new bunch of goons.  The native people catch the first train to Penticton and Coyote is left with the new group, trying once again to get them to play ball.<br /><br />It wasn't the ending I expected in the book.  I had thought there'd be some sort of a happy ending or maybe some way in which Columbus is made into a fool for everyone to see.  But this book is pretty darn honest about Columbus's intentions, as well as his treatment of the Native Americans.  And Coyote has always been a trickster god, neither good or bad.  She wouldn't go saving people just because she made a mistake.  In fact, it's completely realistic that she's make the problem even worse.  The tale is told with a wonderful style of its own.  Coyote says things like, \\"These people I made have no manners.  They act as if they've got no relations\\" (in reference to Columbus & crew).  So if you're hoping for a happy ending to this fable, you're barking up the wrong tree.  If you're looking for a book with a fabulous take on a variety of different legends, this book is appropos.<br /><br />And by the way, you've never seen anything to match it.  The story's good, sure.  But it's William Kent Monkman's illustrations that bring everything fully to life.  The book's drawn in what I can only describe as psychedelic woodcuts.  Consider them woodcuts on PCP.  The native people tend to have pretty normal colors and shades, whereas the Europeans are a gaudy cacophony of violent pinks, greens, oranges, and purples.  And as for how everyone looks, Monkman's style becomes even more original.  Coyote, for her part, is decked out in a hot pink tank top, shorts, and running shoes at all times.  Columbus is a ridiculous clown with a red nose and bright orange hair.  His men resemble an odd assortment of gangster/conquistadors.  I think one of them is almost Elvis.<br /><br />When I said this book was absolutely original I meant it.  However, there's no denying that some aspects of this tale, most notably Coyote being a baseball fanatic, are remarkably similar to Michael Chabon's recent foray into children's literature in \\"Summerland\\".  Whether Chabon actually came up with the concept on his own is up to the reader to decide.  But of the two, give me my \\"Coyote Columbus Story\\" any day.  The only book you can honestly compare it to, at this moment in time and in terms of content, is John Marsden's breathtaking \\"The Rabbits\\".  Holy moley, if you combined the two in a storytime you'd have some of the most ethnically conscientious toddlers alive today.  In any case, I'm just gonna say that as modern legends go, Thomas King struck gold when he chose to tell a whole new kind of Columbus story.  This next Columbus Day, consider countering that day o' genocide with a reading of this excellent little number.  Even if you don't take to it, you'll have to admit that it's an amazing creation to behold.you can honestly compare it to, at this moment in time and in terms of content, is John Marsden's breathtaking \\"The Rabbits\\".

While kids have always loved pirates and the piratical life (Peter Pan, anyone?), the current pirate craze sweeping the nation is somewhat amazing.  Suddenly there are pirate Saturday morning tv shows, an official Talk Like a Pirate Day (September 19), pirate movies making a mil, and pirate picture books.  The breathtaking success of Melinda Long's, \\"How I Became a Pirate\\" is a little odd, but it couldn't have happened to a nicer story.  Full of all the classic words and actions pirates partake of (with the possible exception of walking the plank) the book's a good hearted take on one boy's dream to be a scurvy dog.<br /><br />Jeremy Jacob is the only person on the beach that notices when a pirate ship docks near the ocean shore.  Jeremy, up until this moment, has been building a sand castle, yet the sight of the ship doesn't seem to get anyone's attention but his own.  When Captain Braid Beard and his crew of seven see Jeremy's sand castle skills they are instantly impressed.  They've a treasure to bury after all and Jeremy's just the lad to help them.  Off he goes to join the pirate's life!  There's a lot of \\"Aargh!\\"s and \\"landlubbers\\" to learn.  Lots of talking with your mouth full, on board soccer (Jeremy teaches them how to play), and pillow fights.  Unfortunately, Jeremy also learns that sweet comforts like getting tucked in (\\"No tucking!\\", the crew cried) getting a bedtime story, and receiving a goodnight kiss are lacking on this ship.  After deciding that maybe he doesn't want to be a pirate after all, Jeremy finds the perfect place for his friendly crew to hide the booty.  In the end, the pirates sail away happy and Jeremy goes back to his soccer practice.<br /><br />A caveat:  I'd like to be honest with you and state for the record that any picture book containing the sentence, \\"We must have taken a wrong turn at Bora Bora\\", instantly has my love.  The story is full of fabulous pirate-inspired sentences like that one (though I suspect that particular line has been foisted from a Bugs Bunny cartoon). The pirates for their own part are happy go lucky fellows, ready to welcome their newest crewmate on board, no questions asked.  There's never a scary moment on this particular ship, though the pirates deal with a sudden storm with some relative panic.  David Shannon is the illustrator of this particular outing and as such he's great.  Jeremy Jacob is your typical soccer playing tyke.  The pirates themselves are the real stars of this show, however.  With their terribly rotted teeth and scarred cheeks they might be scary if they weren't so darn appealing.  Kids will enjoy watching the pirate with the patches over both eyes as he lifts first one and then another to see his fellows.  Shannon places infinite little details and touches throughout his work as well.  The shipboard cat is forever attempting to devour the captain's parrot.  The largest and meanest pirate is seen patiently buttoning up his pajamas as Jeremy and the captain engage in a pillow fight.  All in all, the illustrations in this story fit Long's writing perfectly.  You couldn't ask for a better pairing of author and illustrator together.<br /><br />I think kids everywhere have already figured out what grown-ups are only now discovering.  Pirates are eternally amusing.  This book just taps into the already existing piratical love sweeping the nation.  Had this book been lucky enough to win a Caldecott award, I wouldn't have batted an eye.  It's a wonderfully rousing tale.  A feel good pirate piece, if you will.  And a perfect addition to any up and coming young pirate's library.  Fun for the whole fam.line has been foisted from a Bugs Bunny cartoon).

The pirates themselves are the real stars of this show, however.  With their terribly rotted teeth and scarred cheeks they might be scary if they weren't so darn appealing.  Kids will enjoy watching the pirate with the patches over both eyes as he lifts first one and then another to see his fellows.  Shannon places infinite little details and touches throughout his work as well.  The shipboard cat is forever attempting to devour the captain's parrot.  The largest and meanest pirate is seen patiently buttoning up his pajamas as Jeremy and the captain engage in a pillow fight.  All in all, the illustrations in this story fit Long's writing perfectly.  You couldn't ask for a better pairing of author and illustrator together. <br />  <br />I think kids everywhere have already figured out what grown-ups are only now discovering.  Pirates are eternally amusing.  This book just taps into the already existing piratical love sweeping the nation.  Had this book been lucky enough to win a Caldecott award, I wouldn't have batted an eye.  It's a wonderfully rousing tale.  A feel good pirate piece, if you will.  And a perfect addition to any up and coming young pirate's library.  Fun for the whole fam. <br />	2004-08-09

Once you've finished the book you may find yourself yearning to take in some of the sights, sounds, and feelings the story evokes. You will certainly wish that you yourself could take a trip such as the one taken by the heroine of the tale. The danger of writing any book that takes place in the 1920s or 30s is that it could easily be so steeped in nostalgia as to be impossible for kids to connect with. With &quot;Prairie Train&quot; such fears are groundless.<br /><br /> Our first image of our young female heroine is of her lying on a wooden slatted floor. There is a look of anticipation on her face as she listens to the sounds of the Great Northern train going, &quot;Clackety clack clack clack&quot;. The next morning she's aboard the train, going to see her grandmother at the end of the line. Her mother (decked out in a fabulous ensemble that I personally would kill to get my hands on) runs alongside until she is gone. On board, the girl takes stock of her clothing and possessions. She reads the signs painted on the sides of barns and watches the countryside pass. She gets to go to the dining car all by herself and surreptitiously slip some five sugar cubes into her coin purse (we won't consider what may happen to those cubes later). Everything is delightful until the train screeches to a halt due to too much snow on the track. The girl is far less confident at this point, but a grandmotherly figure sitting across the seat offers to show her how to knit. Then a boy with a harmonica plays a tune and things start perking up. The track is cleared and the old woman, before getting off at her stop, gives the girl the afghan she finished. Finally the train enters St. Paul Union Depot (yay Minnesota!) and the girl descends like a princess to the arms of her waiting grandmother below.<br /><br /> Before I praise anything else, I'd just like to thank the fates that John Thompson was the illustrator on this puppy. The pictures in this book are absolutely amazing in many ways. I've always been a fan of realistic illustrations in books for children (Chris Van Allburg and that type of stuff) and Thompson does not disappoint. The clothing worn by characters in this tale is spot on. The girl herself is in a cranberry colored coat, white gloves, and shiny patent leather shoes. The wool beret on her head is so well illustrated that you can practically make out its woolen stitches. Each character presented here looks as if they'd have entire stories to tell, if only you cared to ask. But my favorite picture, bar none, is the shot of the girl bursting into song next to the nice lady on the train as a nearby boy plays a silver harmonica. The expression of the girl, her hands, and her mouth, is so authentic and so realistic (it looks like you've caught her mid-note) that I can't help but assume that Thompson was working from a photograph. I shouldn't be too surprised that these pictures are as great as they are, however. After all, John Thompson illustrated the incredibly remarkable, &quot;Christmas in the Big House, Christmas in the Quarters&quot; which, if you haven't read it, you must run out and buy RIGHT NOW.<br /><br /> None of this is detract from author Marsha Wilson Chall, of course. I loved the repetition of verses explaining the girl's possessions. I enjoyed the idea of a girl in a dining car by herself checking out the world behind her in the mirror of a silver knife. And I really took a great deal of joy in sentences like, &quot;An old windmill spins like a crazy Ferris wheel. A silo stretches, tight with winter feed&quot;. This book is a midwestern joy to read through. It sings as you read it and chugs along merrily. For kids who would kill to take a trip alone and on their own like an adult, this book has instant appeal. A nostalgic story that feels particularly contemporary.the illustrator on this puppy.

564453:US	49148452	R2O9S8W5043MZZ	0698114434	314439538	Mirette on the High Wire	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Earth below her, drifting falling	I remember some of the grumbling that went on when \\"The Man Who Walked Between the Towers\\" won the 2004 Caldecott Award.  \\"But there's already been a Caldecott award winning tightrope walker book\\", some said.  \\" `Mirette On the High Wire' has already covered that territory!\\"  The fact of the matter is, however, that the two books are entirely different stories.  Where the more recent \\"The Man Who Walked\\" is a tale that is dedicated to the memory of the twin towers themselves, \\"Mirette on the High Wire\\" concentrates more on the nature of fear and what it takes to overcome it.  A beautiful book, \\"Mirette\\" tells the tale of a girl, a man, and their newfound dependence on one another.<br /><br />The book takes place in Paris, \\"one hundred years ago\\" in a small boardinghouse.  The widow Gateau runs the place with her daughter Mirette and the two take in a fairly creative crew of jugglers, actors, mimes, and acrobats.  One day a gentleman arrives and is given the back room where there is no view.  Mirette is delighted to find that the man is a tightrope walker, and she immediately insists on learning the trade.  Initially the man refuses, so Mirette begins by teaching herself.  After many many mishaps she finally is able to walk the length of a clothing line.  Having noted her determination, the man, named Bellini, agrees to take her on as a pupil.  Soon the girl learns that Bellini was once the greatest tightrope artist in the world.  He does not walk the ropes anymore because he is afraid, and this fear begins to eclipse Mirette's own abilities as well.  Finally, the man decides to overcome his fear once and for all.  In a spectacular staged event he strings a rope to walk, but it is only through Mirette's own intervention that he can truly take command of his abilities again.<br /><br />The book pretty much appeals to any kid that's ever wished for fame and glory, no matter what fashion.  In the end, it becomes clear that the two will travel together from then on, lending their partnership a kind of father/daughter feeling that is pleasant to see.  The tale was initially going to be a biography of actual tightrope walker Blondin, but author/illustrator Emily Arnold McCully decided to give the book a child protagonist instead.  Mirette is that rare precocious heroine that never gets on your nerves.  Though spunky and determined she doesn't whine or play to the worst of the reader's emotions.  She is, instead, a delightful character to follow.  The story of \\"Mirette\\" is fine in and of itself, but I was really taken with the illustrations.  McCully has a sense of color that makes this book particularly enjoyable to flip through.  From Mirette's bright red hair and royal blue dress to the colorful characters that eat in the Gateau's boarding house, the tale is awash in life and verve.  Personally, I was delighted to find Bellini a bit of a hunk as well.  Say what you will of the wonderful Philippe Petit in \\"The Man Who Walked Between the Towers\\", he's no hunk.  Bellini on the other hand is, not to put too fine a point on it, a hottie.  And I, personally, have no problems with picture books containing handsome men.  No problems at all.<br /><br />Mirette's high button white shoes have become a bit of a cultural symbol for those who love picture books.  Though a work of fiction, her story rings true and is a delightful read.  If you're searching for books in which female characters show spunk but aren't cloying or annoying, seek out \\"Mirette on the High Wire\\" ASAP.  It displays the closest humans could come to flight before the advent of the airplane.  A truly wonderful tale., lending their partnership a kind of father/daughter feeling that is pleasant to see.

564919:US	49148452	R73HHK9TNZBOE	0763615765	224486362	Hug	Books	4	56	57	N	N	A heckuva huggy monkey	Virtually wordless yet convincingly lovable.  That's probably the best way to describe Jez Alborough's sweet, \\"Hug\\".  I'm not usually taken in by cutesy picture books.  For me, if a book is going to be sweet it needs a little added spice.  The kind of stuff you find in Janet Stoeke's, \\"Minerva Louise\\" books, for example.  So the image of a baby chimp opening its arm wide crying, \\"Hug\\", is not supposed to charm me.  Unexpectedly, it did.<br /><br />In this tale, a baby chimpanzee sees different baby/parent animals hugging one another.  Bobo (that's the chimp's name, it turns out) at first is delighted.  He points and yells, \\"Hug\\", whenever he gets a chance.  But soon it's clear to the little guy that he's alone and there's no one for him to hug.  A friendly pair of elephants take pity on the fellow and set out to locate his parent.  Along the way they see more and more animals hugging in their own special ways.  Bobo lets go with an awe inspiring, \\"HUG\\" when at long last his mommy arrives.  The two hug (to a chorus of other animals saying, \\"Hug\\") and before you know it everyone's hugging everyone else.  At the end, it's just Bobo and his mommy walking off together at last.<br /><br />This book has all the usual toddler fears in it.  The separation from the parent.  Seeing a bunch of other people happy when you're not.  I appreciated that author/illustrator Alborough didn't make her animals hug in incorrect ways.  Which is to say, you don't see two giraffes standing on their hind legs hugging with their front ones.  Instead, they nuzzle.  Bobo himself is a pretty sympathetic creation too.  The slow dawning realization that he doesn't have anyone to hug is heartbreaking.  Also, Alborough was clever to cast him as her hero.  Chimpanzees hug just like humans do, so kids will identify intrinsically with the reunited mother and son.  The illustrations in this book never become treacly, and even the massive everybody-hugs-everybody scene at the end doesn't overflow into schmaltz.  It's just a sweet book with a sweet message of hugging.<br /><br />When I checked this book out of the library, the check out girl's reaction to the cover was, \\"awwww\\".  That pretty much sums up the book right there.  It may not contain the wit of an \\"Olivia\\" storyline or the artistic breadth and depth of a Chris Van Allsburg creation, but it's got heart.  And heart, whatever else people might say, is very hard to create.  A great lovable tale.to schmaltz.

Sometimes the richest material a person can plumb comes from their own past.  Barbara Cooney is widely regarded (which is to say, regarded by myself) to rival only the picture book artist Marcia Brown in terms of awards and talent.  Having created fabulous books (if you haven't seen \\"Ox-Cart Man\\" then you haven't seen nuthin') it was only with \\"Hattie and the Wild Waves\\" that Cooney focused her attention onto a story that was a little closer to home.  In this book, the author/illustrator tells the story of her mother growing up in New York in the late 19th/early 20th century.  It is the story of a girl coming to terms with herself.<br /><br />Hattie is a small girl living her Mama and Papa in New York.  She is one of three children and the family is very well to do.  They have servants and grand huge houses and extravagant dinners where they treat all the relatives in the family to a meal each and every Sunday.  Hattie's sister's only goal is to someday be a beautiful bride.  Her brother wishes to work with his father in the business.  But Hattie has different dreams.  She wishes to someday paint, an idea that her family misinterprets (thinking she wants to paint houses) and laughs off the idea.  As we go through the book we get glimpses of how the rich of New York once lived.  Hattie's family is made up entirely of Germans, each businessman having made his fortune in everything from the lumber business to breweries.  The book shows us that Hattie is not keen on such accepted (at the time) female pursuits like piano playing or needlework.  Instead, she loves to paint the things she sees.  Best of all is the summer, when Hattie listens to the waves at the family's summer home and tries to figure out what they're saying.  Years later, Hattie must make an important decision about her own life, and it is only through revisiting the ocean that she can determine what the waves are really trying to tell her.<br /><br />It's a bit confusing that in this biographical book the main character has a name different from that of Barbara Cooney's actual mother.  I can only assume that Cooney did this to allow herself a little artistic license, possibly with chronology or maybe with the facts of the tale.  The book is an excellent way of showing kids elements of the past (as well as the expectations of women during time period) while immersing them in beautiful houses, gardens, oceans, and life in general.  I suspect there'll be many youngsters flipping through this book sighing that they wish THEIR dad would buy them a tennis ball retrieving macaw.  The paintings are lovely as usual and Cooney infuses them with a real pastoral feel.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the story is a bit vague.  Hattie's predicament (what to do with her life) is never really spelled out.  In the last picture we see her climbing the front steps of an art institute, but the text doesn't really make it clear that she either applied to one or got in.  The family is fairly supportive, which is to say they never say that Hattie CAN'T be an artist.  More than anything, this book just reads like a lovely history of a single family.  There isn't any real dramatic tension or conflict.  And as long as I'm complaining, I might as well mention that on one page Hattie is dressed in an evening gown and appears to be in her late teens while on the next page she's dressed in winter clothes and looks roughly nine years of age.  Much of this book will mostly appeal to kids living in New York who are familiar with such sights as Coney Island, Long Island, and the East River.<br /><br />Though a beautiful product, Cooney's, \\"Hattie and the Wild Waves\\", isn't really much more than a pretty package.  You can give or take the story.  It's the descriptions and the illustrations that are the stars of this particular show.  If you'd like to read a relatively wordy picture book to your kids about a girl growing up in the New York area long ago, this book fulfills such a need admirably.  Otherwise, it's not really worth going into.  Though I appreciated the artwork, the storytelling needed an edit.  Just the same, a lovely creation.cture book to your kids about a girl growing up in the New York area long ago, this book fulfills such a need admirably.

565183:US	49148452	R3C2KXJKA36I6Q	0440471478	998471830	The Pushcart War	Books	5	66	67	N	N	Placing the push before the cart	When I decided to read all the great children's books written in the English language (this project isn't going as quickly as I had hoped it would) I made a list.  While writing it, something in the back of my mind reminded me that when I was a kid a book often mentioned was the 1964 title, \\"The Pushcart War\\".  I had never read it when I was younger, but I had clear memories of people discussing it with vim and vigor.  Seeking it out, I decided to read it for my very self.  What I discovered was that this book has been unmercifully forgotten.  Here we have one of the greatest parables of the 20th century and how many kids today have read it?  How many kids will read it in the next 30 years?  Ladies and gentlemen, if you know a child, any child, that has the ability to read you must make it your American duty to seek out a copy of this book, purchase it, and thrust it into the hands of your young acquaintance.  This is one of the best books I have ever read.<br /><br />Now I'm glad I read a 1964 edition of this book because it gets a little confusing at the beginning.  The book begins with a Foreword by Professor Lyman Cumberly of New York University (author of \\"The Large Object Theory of History\\").  This Forward, dated 1986, reflects on the events of the New York Pushcart War and offers some insight.  Here I am, 26 years of age, and I honestly thought that this was a real professor writing a real preface.  Then I saw the copyright date and I figured it out.  This was a fictional professor writing some 20 years in the \\"future\\" when the town was able to sort out the events as they occurred.  Still, the book is written in a somewhat original and scholarly fashion.  There are photographs and scripts and letters to editors and all sorts of cool little touches that make it seem like a real historical document.  Which of course makes the story itself that much more amusing.<br /><br />The events of the Pushcart War began when trucking companies in New York starting making their trucks bigger and bigger.  This, in turn, made traffic far more congested and for the trucking companies there was a definite danger that people would insist that the trucks no longer stay so large.  In a sense of misguided self-preservation, the truckers decide to blame the simple pushcart vendors on the streets for the traffic.  By carefully spreading misinformation and attacking the pushcarts with a series of \\"accidents\\" the pushcart vendors find themselves in trouble.  Their only recourse is to fight back, and they do so with a series of clever ideas.  As the war escalates, so too do the pushcart vendors' strategies.  In the end, not a single person has been killed and for once the little guy has beaten the bigger one.<br /><br />In the Foreword, this sentence sums up the book: \\"...big wars are caused by the same sort of problems that led to the Pushcart War\\".  True enough, some wars ARE caused by the problems found in this book.  There are some wonderful touches in this story that will give adult readers an extra laugh.  For example, the mayor of New York is in the pay of the big truckers and gives a speech about them while running for reelection.  In it, he explains that big trucks mean bigger business, and hence - progress.  If you want to ship a lot of peanut butter, you need a big truck.  The candidate then goes on to say, \\"My opponent, Archie Love, is against trucks.  He is, therefore, against progress.  Maybe he is even against peanut butter\\".  We've all heard fifty different versions of this speech in our time.  Chalk this silly little sentence up to Jean Merrill's sly writing skills.<br /><br />I love the characters in this story and the silly battles that are pitched.  Because it was written in 1964 there is the odd reference once to \\"lady drivers\\", but it comes off as quaint rather than offensive.  This is also definitely a New York creation.  The original illustrations by Ronni Solbert look like nothing so much as small New Yorker cartoons turned into illustrations.  Honestly, if you want a way of explaining to kids how some wars are begun (recent wars, unfortunately, don't quite fit this mold, but that's okay) this is a great way to do it.  I was especially taken with the pushcart vendors' non-violent response, culminating in a honest-to-goodness peace march near the end.<br /><br />Why don't more people know about this book?  Why is it slowly but surely being forgotten by the masses?  People, if I had my way I'd assign this book to every man, woman, and child living in the United States today.  I'd shout its wonders from the rooftops and glorify it in song.  I would, in short, force the world to admit that it's a classic tale.  Until I'm able to do so, however, I urge you to read it yourself.  You'll be delighted by its wit and wisdom as well as author Jean Merrill's great storytelling skills.  Never forget it again.artoons turned into illustrations.

565963:US	49148452	R37NNNQWV9AMWR	0698113829	648796887	Lon Po Po: A Red-Riding Hood Story from China	Books	5	40	41	N	N	Nice is different than good	Like film awards, book awards rarely go to an artist's best work.  Usually if a picture book has won a Caldecott medal you can sift through the author and illustrator's other books and inevitably find something far more deserving.  This is true of almost every author/illustrator, save one.  Ed Young has had a varied and fabulous career.  From his spectacular \\"Seven Blind Mice\\" to his insipid and poorly drawn \\"Turkey Girl\\" he's run the gamut from \\"Yippee!\\" to \\"Bleach!\\".  But his Caldecott winning \\"Lon Po Po\\" falls squarely into the \\"Yippee!\\" category.  To my mind, it is his best work.  A stunning edition of the Chinese tale of Lon Po Po, this story weaves elements of Grimm Fairy Tales with \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" and comes out swinging.<br /><br />One day a mother leaves her three daughters to visit their grandmother on her birthday.  Before she leaves she instructs the girls to lock the doors soundly after she is gone.  The girls do so but a wily wolf has overheard that the mother will be leaving.  The wolf disguises himself as an old woman and knocks on the door.  When asked who he is, he responds that he is their grandmother (or \\"Po Po\\") come to stay with them.  The children foolishly let the animal in and he quickly douses the lights.  After many questions about the supposed grandmother's bushy tail and sharp claws the eldest and cleverest daughter catches sight of the wolf's snout and must find a way to save her sisters.  Not only does she succeed, but she also finds a way to get rid of the wolf forever.<br /><br />In the dedication of this book, Ed Young writes, \\"To all the wolves of the world for lending their good name as a tangible symbol for our darkness\\".  This was written in part, I suspect, to appease the wolf lovers of the world.  Much like the old fairy tales of European folklore, this tale has its fair share of violence.  The wolf's end, for example, is a particularly nasty way to go.  And because it has been created so realistically in this book, I suspect that there are probably some animal advocates who will take offense at his death.  Nonetheless, we're not dealing with reality here, people.  We're dealing with fairy tales and in these stories wolves are (as Young himself said) representative of our own evil.<br /><br />The story is translated by Young himself and is done beautifully.  The words in this tale sing.  Yet even the best laid plotting can be undone by poor illustrations.  In this particular case, you've nothing to fear because Young has bent over backwards to bring you absolute breathtaking beauty.  Combining watercolors with pastels, the book is simultaneously gorgeous and frightening.  It may take a couple readings, but if you look carefully in some of these pictures you will find wolf images hidden in the landscapes and backgrounds of a great many scenes.  The first spread in this book is of the mother leaving her children.  As she goes, the land beneath her feet is shaped like that of a wolf's nose, the cottage the eye of the animal.  Often the pictures are separated into threes, giving the book a formal feeling.  Finally, the pictures of the girls and their enemy are excellent.  Sometimes the merest of glimpses of the wolf are scary enough to drill home what a threat he is.  You really do feel scared for the children when they cuddle up with their supposed grandmother in bed, only to find her to be a hungry beastie.<br /><br />The \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" story is all well and good in and of itself, but it always lacked kick.  \\"Lon Po Po\\" has more than kick.  It has bite.  It will enrapture small children and give them tangible forms for their darkest fears.  It will hypnotize any reader, drawing them effortlessly into its deeply interesting story.  Of all the Caldecott winning picture books of the last 15 years, this one is my favorite, hands down.ok, I suspect that there are probably some animal advocates who will take offense at his death.

You really do feel scared for the children when they cuddle up with their supposed grandmother in bed, only to find her to be a hungry beastie. <br />  <br />The \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" story is all well and good in and of itself, but it always lacked kick.  \\"Lon Po Po\\" has more than kick.  It has bite.  It will enrapture small children and give them tangible forms for their darkest fears.  It will hypnotize any reader, drawing them effortlessly into its deeply interesting story.  Of all the Caldecott winning picture books of the last 15 years, this one is my favorite, hands down. <br /> <br />	2004-08-04

It's rare that an author packs so much great storytelling punch in such a little package.  So when I discovered that Minerva Louise, the extraordinarily curious chicken, had further adventures to her name, I immediately located \\"Minerva Louise and the Red Truck\\".  Just as great as its predecessor, this tale tells the story of a curious member of the poultry family and her attempts to make sense of the world around her.<br /><br />Minerva Louise (who is prone to loving things) loves her farm's red truck.  A playful foul, she likes to dress up in the abandoned bandanas she finds in the back and create tea parties out of tools and flowerpots.  One day, while playing, the truck jerks to life and Minerva finds herself driving about.  While out she translates the things she sees into farm-based items.  A backyard swimming pool is a lake.  Golfers are farmers hard at work in their fields.  Best of all, a church (to a chicken's eye) is nothing more than a, \\"silly barn wearing a hat!\\".  In a nice section of the book Minerva spies a construction site and decides that it must be a farm for other trucks.  Hither and yon are baby trucks and big strong ones as well.  By the end of the day she's happy with what she has seen, but she's glad that the red truck has returned back to her home.  That is, until she sees a bright and shiny fire engine!<br /><br />Minerva is the Amelia Bedelia of the farm world.  It's sweet to see how everything fits into her perceptions and misconceptions.  Kids reading her books can recognize where she's wrong and feel superior that they know more than this adventurous chicklet.  For my own part, I was happy that the illustrations of the little heroine show her joy and contentment so clearly.  She's just so darn perky and pleased with everything she sees that it's a joy to watch her.  This particular book combines farm life with construction sites.  For those kids who are really into trucks and trailers, this might be an ideal storytime reading selection.  It's difficult not to love the plucky (ha ha!) Minerva Louise so definitely take the time to check her out.  If you've never seen a chicken beam with contentment, this should be the book for you.are really into trucks and trailers, this might be an ideal storytime reading selection.

Tons of these books appear on the market every year and they bring in a steady profit time and time again.  Perhaps the most successful of these (which is to say, it won an award) is Karen Ackerman's charming, \\"Song and Dance Man\\".  A simple tale of a grandfather puttin' on a show for his grandchildren, the book is a touching tribute to the Vaudeville kings and queens of yore.<br /><br />Three bright eyed urchins appear at their grandfather's door one day, to his evident delight.  Without further ado he leads them up into the house's attic where he keeps a trunk of old treasures.  It takes a little sifting and shifting to find exactly what he needs, but soon Grandpa's old taps are on his feet and the lamps in the attic become the spotlights of a makeshift stage.  Grandpa begins with a shuffle footed tap solo then moves on to banjo playing/singing, magic tricks, and awful old jokes.  The night's entertainment is topped off with a grand finale of tapping and dancing.  The crowd (of three) goes wild and everything is put away again.  \\"But as he turns off the attic light, Grandpa glances back up the stairs, and we wonder how much he really misses that time on the vaudeville stage, when he was a song and dance man\\".<br /><br />You've probably seen illustrations by Minnesota based artist Stephen Gammell before and just didn't know it.  They've a kind of controlled insanity, though this book is not half as violent to the senses as his truly disturbing \\"Old Black Fly\\".  Instead, this story comes off as merely messy, but with a vibrant undertone.  The colors in the pictures are often of a sweet rainbow filled spectrum.  Grandpa's nose, a permanent red, sits prominently on his kind face.  I think the real joy of this book is that you know the main character is having the time of his life.  He's truly enjoying reliving his days as a performer, a fact drilled home by the book's wistful final sentence.  Thumbs up to author Karen Ackerman too for effectively creating such a great grandpa character.  Who wouldn't want a talented guy like this in their family?<br /><br />For a sweet intergenerational tale that doesn't focus (for a change) on wise advice or dealing with death, this book takes the cake.  When you read a book that takes as much joy out of life as this one does, you know you're gonna find yourself going back to it again and again.  Sentimental in only the best sense of the word.entence.  Thumbs up to author Karen Ackerman too for effectively creating such a great grandpa character.

But then, I'm not too keen on good ideas.  When I look at the beautiful beautiful book that is, \\"Minerva Louise\\", I am astonished by its simplicity.  It's fabulous how with only a few well chosen lines, author/illustrator Janet Morgan Stoeke is able to create something as perfect as this little book.  Compare this with other awful and simplistic books (\\"Where's Spot?\\" anyone?) and this becomes even more of a monumental accomplishment than it originally appeared.<br /><br />The story's just as simple as the pictures.  One day the sweet chicken Minerva Louise (who greatly admires the farmhouse) decides that it might be a good idea if she poked her head in and looked around.  Once inside she gathers all sorts of odd ideas.  A flowerpot of daisies is reduced to flattened flowers when Minerva takes it for a comfortable chair.  The sleeping cat?  A friendly cow, of course.  In her barnyard-mindedness a tricycle is a tractor and a flower coverlet on a bed is a meadow.  After further examinations (and unintentional chicken mischief) Minerva decides that she would prefer to live in the yard but that she'll visit the house.  In a final panel, Minerva sits contentedly on a pie on the windowsill, \\"because she loved the house with the red curtains\\".<br /><br />And I love Minerva.  There just aren't enough worthy chicken protagonists in picture books today.  Moreover, there aren't enough picture books that tell a straightforward story with the wit and storytelling skills found in this little marvel.  I know I'm gushing over this thing, but it's one of those books you need to see firsthand to understand.  Minerva's so amiable that if she was your chicken I'm sure you'd bake pies with the sole purpose of letting her sit on them.  This is a very early reader book, and it will make a much loved addition to any child laden home.  If I could recommend a single picture book published in the last 20 years with all my heart and soul, it would be the sweet, \\"Minerva Louise\\".  Miss it, and you're missing out.in the last 20 years with all my heart and soul, it would be the sweet, \\"Minerva Louise\\".  Miss it, and you're missing out. <br />	2004-08-03

Having taken the world by storm with their mightily successful \\"Leo the Late Bloomer\\" author Robert Kraus and that dynamic illustrating duo of Jose and Ariane Aruego decided to give the world of picture books another go.  As with \\"Leo\\", the title character in \\"Milton the Early Riser\\" has a problem.  It's not a huge problem, nor a particularly tragic one, but it bugs him just the same.  Milton (an adorable panda cub) has woken up early and there is no one else up and nothing at all to do.  To amuse himself Milton attempts to watch television (only the color bars are on), to jump up and down, to dance and do tricks, and finally to sing.  It's the singing that wrecks the most damage to the other drowsy animals in Milton's neighborhood.  An unexpected repercussion of Milton's little song is that the very mountains and trees themselves shake and tremble and a huge whirlwind blows the other sleeping animals hither and yon.  Patiently, Milton puts everyone back in their proper place, tiring himself in the process.  When his parents wake up Milton is fast asleep, a small smile on his face.<br /><br />The Aruegos are especially talented at making you feel sorry for their picture book creations.  Though Milton is never put through any particularly dire straights, you feel really sorry for him when he plods about, alone and lonely.  Fortunately, he's a bit of a card.  By amusing himself with funny body positions and clever balancing tricks he also amuses the child reader.  The book is infused with the regular fabulous colors and creations one has come to expect from this artistic duo.  Not only beautiful, but also funny.  Milton is particularly amusing when he thinks up original ways of schlepping animals from place to place to place.<br /><br />The story's good too.  I should probably mention that.  But I love the Aruegos and for me they're the whole reason to pick up this book.  It's a sweet story, sure.  But it's also a fabulous book to flip through.  Lovely looking.  Lovely reading..  Lovely reading. <br />	2004-08-03

Now, you've been reading the recommended reviews and you've heard of this book, &quot;Maples in the Mist&quot;. It sounds like a good book. After all it translates the great children's poems of the Tang Dynasty in China. But let's say you're a parent that is worried that maybe a book of classical poetry will bore your little high strung moppets. Perhaps you fear that this book, while filling a need, is potentially less than perfect simply because there are so few like it out there today. Regarding fears, allow me to put your tender mind at rest. &quot;Maples in the Mist&quot; is not only authentic Chinese poetry, not only interesting, not only gorgeous to look at (all thanks to the illustrations of Jean & Mou-sien Tseng), but also an evocative pleasant book that parents will love just as much as their children will. It deserves to belong in every library in the world.<br /><br /> Author/translator Minfong Ho begins the book with some explanations. Though she attempted to get her children to love the classical Tang poetry that she grew up with, Ho found that her Sesame Street addled kiddies didn't have the inclination to sit and memorize the Chinese words. Sensing that perhaps she was going about it all wrong, Ho decided to do an official Chinese to English translation of some of the best Tang poems created with kids in mind. Though this isn't an entirely new idea, few people have translated Tang poetry recently and fewer well. To avoid some of the pitfalls that come with projects like this one, Ho decided not to retain the original rhyme schemes and instead let the poems be translated literally. The result is a collection of sixteen small lovely poems that touch on everything from boyish pranks to the color of maple leaves in the fall.<br /><br /> Accompanying each poem is a watercolor illustration by the artist couple Jean and Mou-Sien Tseng. According to their quote on the book jacket, the pictures have been designed, &quot;in a classic Chinese manner&quot;. Each picture comes with a stamp of the original author as well as a Chinese version of the poem to the side. Combing through the collection, it's difficult to settle on one single poem that gives me the most pleasure. If I had to choose though, I think &quot;Climbing Stork Tower&quot; is my favorite. In the picture you see a small village below and in the distance peach mist circles purple mountains. The sun is sinking but is still visible and bright through the early evening haze. Even if the poem itself wasn't lovely, I could just sit and stare at this painted scene for hours and hours. In fact, I think that's part of the reason I liked these painted illustrations as much as I did. They're little pieces of art illustrating great meaningful words. And for those amongst you who wish to know more about the Tang poets themselves, Ho includes a useful section at the back of the book. Each poet receives five or six lines summing up his life (sorry, they're all male) and the role poetry played for him.<br /><br /> Will your children be bored by this book? Well, honestly, it depends on what kind of children you have. If your kids think the only books they'll ever want to read are the ones based on children's television characters, then no, this may not be the book for you. If, on the other hand, you have children that take the time to contemplate matters of the world a little deeply from time to time, this might be for them. This is a book for the dreamy children of the world. For the quiet worldly ones and the loud curious ones. Most importantly, it's a book that you yourself will love reading again and again and again, if only to look at the pictures and hear the pleasant words. Minfong Ho did the world a great service when she created this small gem. We owe her a debt of gratitude.te on the book jacket, the pictures have been designed, &quot;in a classic Chinese manner&quot;.

As you may or may not know, &quot;The Stone Book&quot; is the first in a quartet of stories following a family throughout several generations. For my own part, I learned about the series through a hoity-toity British literary periodical entitled, &quot;Children's Literature In Education&quot;. The article I read mentioned that these were great lost classics and that anyone who knows ANYTHING about kiddie lit (as I like to call it) should be familiar with these books. The fact that this book won a coveted Phoenix Award years ago cemented the deal for me. The Phoenix Awards are given to children's books that, some believe, haven't gotten the attention they so richly deserve. So the real question becomes, is &quot;The Stone Book&quot; worthy of attention? Should children everywhere have to read it? And the answer is yes and no.<br /><br /> This tale takes place in Victorian England and is all of sixty pages. Really, it's not much more than a short story in book form. In this tale, young Mary goes to a nearby church that her father is building. Her dad's a stonemason and is exceedingly good with rocks of all kinds. Mary cannot read, though her father can, and one night she asks him for a book as a present. In answer, he takes the girl with him to a cavern between the rocks. Leading her to a tight passage, he gives her strict instructions that she must follow. He tells her that once she reaches the end of the cavern she must come back and let him know if she still wants that book. Mary goes and discovers ancient cave paintings as well as footprints from hundreds of people before her. On returning to her father she is told that it has been a tradition in their family for the father to bring his eldest child (usually a son) down to that cavern and that it has been done for hundreds of generations. That night, Mary receives a book like no other and that, in a way, tells the tale of that day's adventures.<br /><br /> There's a great deal going on in this tiny creation. Discussions about rocks come up frequently, often touching on the fossils and ancient (one might even venture, prehistoric) footprints that are found in the region. This leads, inevitably, to religion, the unspoken possibility of evolution, and the nature of literacy itself. One of the many debates in this book happens between Mary's father and her uncle Old William. Old William contends that books are a waste of time and only make people discontented with life. Mary's father is of the opinion that true wasted time is doing work every day and never showing anything for it. There's even a suggestion that Mary's father is discontented with his life, a fact that comes out when he gives in to the urge to drink once in a while.<br /><br /> And all this happens in a scant sixty pages. Reading it, I found myself (for a long time) wondering if kids would like to read it. Seems to me that this book is a real contender for the books-adults-love-and-kids-ignore category of the library. Sure, there are deep rich meanings just waiting to be dug up throughout the text. Sure, this book tackles big subjects in a small clear way. But how many children are going to pick this puppy up voluntarily and enjoy it? Until Mary found herself alone in the deep dark cavern, I doubted that much of anything in this story would hold their interest. Perhaps that's why this book has been as forgotten as it is until now. If the kiddies don't dig it, what's the point?<br /><br /> In short, &quot;The Stone Book&quot; succeeds and fails. It succeeds because it truly is a wonderfully written tale. It's a great look at daily life in a far distant time. It fails because I can't see many kids today successfully sinking their claws into the text. If you want something with a modicum of intelligence for yourself, enjoy. Just don't go handing it out to any five year olds you know..

Books concerning teenage fatherhood have blossomed over the last few years. I'm not certain what the cause of this trend is, and I don't know where it will end. Certainly some fabulous books have resulted, of course. The multi-award winning, &quot;First Part Last&quot;, is probably the best known of these adolescent daddy stories. Lesser known, and far cheerier, is the delightful &quot;Flour Babies&quot; by Anne Fine. Taking a concept that has been used in everything from an episode of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; to an episode of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, this story concentrates on a boy, his adorable sack of flour, and his attempts to come to terms with his own absentee pop.<br /><br /> When Mr. Cassidy gets stuck with the worst possible students in Room 8 he isn't surprised. When he is stuck giving these same students a lame project for the upcoming Science Fair he remains unsurprised. But when the project turns out to concern Flour Babies, he's livid. In this project the teacher must hand a six-pound burlap sack of flour to each of his students. Over the course of several weeks these lagabout kids must take extra special care of their new babies. Of course, Cassidy is convinced that this project will only lead to flour exploding in his classroom at the hands of his rowdy kids. When the biggest toughest underachiever of them all, Simon Martin, misunderstands and thinks that the end of the project will result in a grand flour baby kick-off, he throws himself headlong into his baby's care. As time goes by, Simon begins to care deeply for his baby and his thoughts turn to the father that abandoned him when he was a babe. Through his own slow thought processes, Simon learns to understand what fatherhood entails and what it truly means to be unencumbered and young.<br /><br /> This book was originally published in Britain and as such I initially assumed that it took place overseas. But about the time Simon's mom comments that his deadbeat dad took off for Chicago when he left, I came to the horrific realization that this book was trying to be American. Trying and failing. I mean, honestly. This is the kind of book that contains sentences like, &quot;his dad was a duffer&quot; and has characters that say &quot;Sir&quot; all the time and have names like &quot;Simon&quot;. Also, the book kind of decomposes towards the end. While the storyline up until the last 2 or so chapters has been fine, suddenly Anne Fine tacks on a Mel Brooks type of let's-make-everything-crazy finale. You've got a previously sympathetic teacher giving a ridiculous (and increasing) number of detentions, a crazy escape via running along the tops of the school's desks, and a grand finish of thick floating flour everywhere. I only wish the writing could have kept up, but it didn't.<br /><br /> Which isn't to say there isn't a lot going for this book. Admittedly, the students keep breaking into bizarre non-teenage sentences from time to time but they're enjoyable characters. For his part, Simon is a kind of relief to read. I was convinced that this book would turn out to be another tale in which a wise but crazy teacher gives his tough students a true challenge and at the end they all beat the science nerds because someone actually took the time to believe in them. Not a chance. Simon Martin is a good example of that. He's unrepentantly thick at the beginning of the book and though he's worked out some issues by the end, he's unrepentantly thick there too. And finally, the biggest and best reason to read this book; it's darned funny. I think I was officially won over when the teacher watching the detention students found herself hoping that Simon would entertain her that day with the Bloodied Tongue. This is where Simon empties surreptitiously an entire cartridge of red ink from a pen onto his tongue and then, &quot;let this gory-looking monstrosity out of his mouth for the whole rest of the detention, rendering her incapable of eating her sandwich butamusing her mightily&quot;. Any book that uses humor correctly has my love already.<br /><br /> &quot;Flour Babies&quot; apparently won the British Carnegie Medal (which corresponds to our Newbery Medal over here stateside) which surprises me a little. I think it's great but I wouldn't necessarily cover it with awards. Still, if you're looking for a fun read that's not only amusing but also great to pick up and reread, I think this book's for you.

571316:US	49148452	R37462WMXRZN1K	0140502777	181998886	Andy and the Lion (Picture Puffins)	Books	4	16	18	N	N	A dandy lion	Having lambasted, decimated, and torn to shreds James Daugherty's remarkably racist, &quot;Daniel Boone&quot;, it seemed only fair that I read a book of his that did not hinge on either white supremacy or genocide. &quot;Andy and the Lion&quot; seemed a good guess and after I read it I found I didn't just tolerate it... I didn't just like it... Heck I LOVED this book. What a great story! What superb illustrations and well phrased narrative. What an excellent excellent picture book... one that all children should read and remember for as long as they have brains to do so. Mr. Daugherty has not just reinterpreted the tale, &quot;Androclus and the Lion&quot;, he has put his mark on it and made it his very own.<br /><br /> One day a bright young barefooted lad named Andy decided to patronize his local lending library. Inside he got out a book on lions and proceeded to read it through his meals and well into the evening. After his grandfather told him some wild tales of hunting lions in the wild, Andy went to bed and dreamed of the large yellow beasts. Upon waking he clearly had lions on his mind, but he goes to school as per usual. On the way there he stumbles across an honest to goodness lion of his own and finds that the poor thing has a nasty thorn caught in its paw. After removing the offending article (the book, ever covering its bases, informs us that, &quot;Andy always carried his pliers in the back pocket of his overalls&quot;) the lion is grateful and the two part ways. Not long thereafter, the circus comes to town. Andy goes to watch the fun but when a lion escapes from his high steel cage and makes for the boy, Andy thinks he's done for. Surprise! It turns out that the lion is the same one Andy helped. The two are joyfully reconciled, the people cheer, Andy gets his own parade, and in the end the two friends go back to the library to return the book.<br /><br /> First of all, I want to thank the author for clearing something up for me. In his dedication, Mr. Daugherty thanks the two lions that sit in front of the New York Public Library. Uneducated me, I didn't know they were named Lady Astor and Lord Lenox, respectively. Just goes to show the benefits of reading older picture books, I guess. Now this book's a pip, no question. I challenge you to locate a single youngster that won't be enthralled by either Andy's lackadaisical lifestyle or his numerous encounters with the king of the jungle. The story reads with an easygoing vernacular that's difficult to resist. Heck, the first line in the story is, &quot;It was a bright day with just enough wind to float a flag&quot;. How can you not enjoy that? Daugherty has cleverly melded elements of this tale with the original fable on which it is based. What he doesn't care to say in the text, he shows in his delightful illustrations. For example, having read just the words of this tale, your average child reader might wonder how the lion met Andy in the first place. Daugherty has already covered his bases on that one. Earlier in the tale, as Andy reads of lions' lives in front of a fire, his father glances at a paper whose headline reads, &quot;Lion Escapes Circus&quot;. The pictures in this tale are filled to the brim with action and movement as well. There's a great moment when the thorn stuck in the lion's paw comes free and both Andy and the feline are sent cartwheeling backwards, legs askew and manes tousled. Admittedly, there's not much in the way of color in this tale. But heck, there's not much in the way of color in &quot;Make Way for Ducklings&quot; either. I hardly think it hurts the book a jot.<br /><br /> This being the author that introduced the world to one of the most outrageously racist Newbery award winners, and being that the publication date on this puppy is 1938 (not the best year for tolerance), you might be wondering if there are any notable racial stereotypes marring an otherwise favorable text. Well, ladies and gents, I in this entire tale there is onlya single picture of someone of color. In the scene where Andy protects the escaped lion from the now angry townspeople there's a brief image of a black fellow jogging away from the lion. It's innocuous and hardly worth a mumble of outrage. Obviously it would have been nice if this story had included one or two positive minority figures, but you take what you can get sometimes.<br /><br /> So I've been won over to a James Daugherty book, in the end. Weaving a tight and lovable story of a boy, his dog, and his lion, I wish I could say that &quot;Andy and the Lion&quot; is well known today. It's not, and more's the pity. This is just a fabulous tale that deserves loving attention by scads of bright intelligent people. As it is, I insist that you go out and locate a copy for yourself immediately if not sooner. You won't regret it.. and even if you do you'll have to tip your hat a little to its good spirited whimsy.is only a single picture of someone of color.

I love reviewing picture books for Amazon.com. Normally this is a highly enjoyable thing to do and it gives me a great amount of joy. Unfortunately, I've done it long enough that I've come to the undeniable realization that if I EVER give a negative review to a book that some adult adored as a child (be it the racist &quot;They Were Strong and Good&quot; by Robert Lawson or the treacly &quot;Betsy Tacy&quot; books by Maud Hart Lovelace) I'm slowly but surely pummeled with negative votes. This is usually because adults have an incredibly difficult time separating themselves from the books they loved when they were kids, no matter how poorly the book was made. I think you can see where I'm going with this. I came to pick up &quot;Kitten For a Day&quot; by Ezra Jack Keats (undeniably one of the most influential picture book artists in the United States) because it appeared on the New York Public Library's Summer 2004 reading list for early readers. I opened it up, read it once, read it twice, read it (with incredible reluctance) thrice and came to a horrid conclusion. Oh this book is bad. It's just...awful. If you're an adult that grew up with this book and you want to introduce it to your children, go right ahead. That's your prerogative and far be it from me or anyone else to stop you. But if you just heard about this book through the grapevine and you want to know a little more about it, let me clarify right now that this story is not good. It is not good at all.<br /><br /> The plot is a familiar one. A group of kittens are playing together when an adorably puppy joins them. After climbing into a bowl with them one of the kitties asks, &quot;Are you a kitten?&quot; The puppy replies, &quot;Uh huh - I think so&quot;. That apparently satisfies the kittens and the group, with puppy in tow, go about a set of catlike adventures. They lap up milk (the puppy makes a mess). They meow (the puppy tries but it ends up as &quot;meee...rrruff!&quot;). They jump from chair to chair (the puppy takes a tumble). They even chase a mouse (the puppy bumping its head and the mouse apologizing to the pup). Finally the pup's mom arrives and waving goodbye to his friends the puppy suggests that next time they all try to be dogs. The end.<br /><br /> You read through this description and you think, &quot;There's nothing inherently bad about this story&quot;. I agree. There's nothing inherantly good about it either, though. The problem is that it's just so doggone (ho ho!) bland. Author/illustrator Ezra Jack Keats is best known for his groundbreaking/breathtaking/award making &quot;Snowy Day&quot;. I know &quot;Snowy Day&quot;, ladies and gentlemen. &quot;Snowy Day&quot; is one of my favorite books. And this, sir, is no &quot;Snowy Day&quot;. In that book the illustrations were artful cutouts and colors. The art in this book is drawn and, sad to say, drawn badly. The pictures are poorly painted and done in a kind of slapdash manner (especially that last shot of the puppy being taken home by its mom). The scant words in the story convey the plot but they're bereft of wit or whimsy. The greatest crime in this story is that compared to the great picture books made after (and even before) its publication in 1974 it doesn't stand up to close scrutiny.<br /><br /> If you're looking for a fabulous picture book about a little dog that pretends to be a cat for a while, I highly recommend you seek out &quot;Widget&quot; by Lyn Rossiter McFarland. If you want a picture book that tells a great story through visual images rather than words, try the Caldecott Award winning &quot;Tuesday&quot; by Dave Wiesner. This book has sentimental value for a lot of people, but it just isn't in the same league as a lot of really great picture books out there today. Life's too short to waste it on reading tepid picture books to your kids. Forgo the insipid pleasures of &quot;Kitten For a Day&quot;.rruff!&quot;).

571440:US	49148452	R2F0U7U59PC9WL	0553296981	636860937	Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl	Books	5	461	506	N	N	Young girl, heck.  Diary of a young woman is more like it.	Imagine that someday you are remembered for all eternity at a very particular time and at a very particular age. You could be remembered forever as being 25 on September the 11th or you could be remembered as being 44 when JFK was shot. It seems awfully cruel for someone to be remembered between the ages of 13 to 15. Do you remember what you were like at that age? Would you want anyone to think of you as that old for as long as your name is remembered? Such is the fate of Anne Frank. Now, I never read this book when I was young. High schools, in my experience, tend to assign the play version of this story when they want to convey Anne Frank's tale. Anne tends to be remembered as the little girl who once wrote, &quot;I still believe that people are really good at heart&quot; in spite of her sufferings. So I should be forgiven for expecting this book to be the dewy-eyed suppositions of a saintly little girl. Instead, I found someone with verve, complexity, and a personality that I did not always particularly like. What I discovered, was the true Anne Frank.<br /><br /> The diary of Anne begins when she is 13 years of age and the Jews are already wearing yellow stars in Amsterdam. Anne is your usual precocious girl, flirting with boys and being impudent when she can get away with it. When at last the time comes for the Franks to go into hiding (Margot Frank, Anne's sister, has been issued an order for her removal) they do so with another family, the Van Daans. In a small floor hidden above Otto Frank's old workplace the two families are aided by faithful friends and employees. Over the course of the diary we watch and listen through Anne's eyes as, for two years, the people in the attic are put through terrible deprivations and trials. There are good times and bad, but Anne is a singularly biased narrator and her observations must usually be taken with a grain of salt. After a while you become so comfortable with Anne's observations and voice that the final page of the narrative comes as a shock when the capture of Anne and her family is finally announced.<br /><br /> I recently had the mixed pleasure of finding and rereading my own diary from around the age of 14. After forcing myself to look through the occasional passage here and there I was forced to conclude that for her age, Anne is a marvelous writer. She has a sense of drama, tension, and narrative that is particularly enthralling. It's painful to think about what a great writer she could have been had she lived any longer. Honestly, the Anne I met in this book showed all the worst characteristics of her age. I found her detestation of her own mother to be particularly repugnant. Then I remembered... she's an early adolescent. Of course she hates her mother! Of course she's just simply awful a lot of the time. But you can see who she's becoming, and that's what makes the book so hard to get through. You can see her growth and her character. You know that she's learning and trying to understand what it means to be a human being during World War II. It's all the more awful that this would be the age she was preserved at.<br /><br /> The book is remarkable on so many levels. I think young teenage girls will understand Anne's plight intrinsically. Who couldn't? Who doesn't remember the rocky years of 13-15? The need for attention? The sobbing for no particular reason? By the end of the diary, Anne becomes far more philosophical. She no longer records the family's every move and action. Instead, she ponders questions like whether or not young people are lonelier than old people. Or what it means to be good. Though you may not like the protagonist of this book at all times, you come to understand and sympathize with her. She is a remarkable author, all the more so when you consider that this diary was written for her eyes alone at the time. If I could require kids to read something in school, I think this would top the list. It probably remains the best Holocaust children's book in existence today.k in existence today.	2004-07-30

(Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Charlesbridge)	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Sing a song of popcorn	If someone came up and told me that as a punishment for the many sins of my life I was going to be forced to write a non-fiction children's picture book, I'd probably run through the streets screaming with fear. Do you have any concept how hard this must be? Making non-fiction topics palatable to kids is nearly impossible, and it takes real skill to a) Come up with a topics that kids will enjoy and b) Write a book that kids will want to read more than once. Enter Elaine Landau's clever, &quot;Popcorn!&quot;. Written with wit, interesting on almost every page, and illustrated with flair, the book is a fine fine addition to any library (public or personal) that needs some honest-to-goodness interesting non-fiction topics to fill the shelves.<br /><br /> First of all, you'd better make certain that the kids reading this book actually like popcorn before you hand it to them. This puppy is one thorough concoction. Effortlessly melding factoids with the history of popcorn, kids learn how this nummy snack became as beloved as it is today. Reading through the text you learn where popcorn is grown, the scientific properties that make it pop in the first place, which residents of Peru were the first to grow, pop, and eat it, and the role popcorn had with the early American Puritans. There are even tips for how to pop popcorn yourself, recipes for making popcorn balls, and a fabulous bibliography of popcorn related websites and books.<br /><br /> The text of this book is witty, bright, and constantly interesting. It's just the reader's good luck, though, that the illustrations are just as fascinating. Now, usually I don't approve of the typical furry-woodland-creature-that-teaches-the-kids-an-important-lesson. In this particular case, the reader follows a cheery raccoon as he leads the viewer through various popcorn-related gags and parcels of information. The raccoon is done so well though that it never appears as an annoying sight gag. In fact, illustrator Brian Lies is so talented that the entire book is a visual joy to flip through. The scientific chart of what happens to popcorn kernels when they're heated is interesting. The map of popcorn raising states is interesting. Heck, even the sight gags work. How many picture books can you honestly say that's the case with? Mighty few, methinks.<br /><br /> All in all, if you've a kid that's been assigned a scientific project but they're not interested in any potential projects, this might be the perfect solution. What kid wouldn't want to study something as tasty and fun as wonderful fluffy tasty popcorn? A great book about an interesting topic.

After taking Britain by storm and becoming one of the most popular picture books to hit it big in merry old England, America finally got a chance to read &quot;The Gruffalo&quot; in 1999. And, to be honest, it didn't make that big of a splash. It's a nice story, no question. There's a good basic plot and amusing illustrations by the talented Axel Scheffler. It's just a nice book, no more, no less. If you're looking for a picture book fable that adapts old variations of ancient folktales, methinks &quot;The Gruffalo&quot; might be exactly what you're looking for.<br /><br /> One day a carefree little mouse takes a jaunty stroll through the big woods. While doing so he comes across a sly fox that wishes to invite the mouse to lunch (wink wink). The mouse is no fool and makes his apologies, saying that he wishes he could but he's already meeting a gruffalo. The fox is unfamiliar with what a gruffalo exactly is, so the mousie comes up with an extravagant and horrific monster. This description is so effective that the fox speeds away. Next, the mouse meets a hungry owl and the same scene occurs only with slightly new gruffalo descriptors. After the owl makes his excuses and flees the mouse meets a snake and the whole process begins again. Once the snake slithers out of slight the mouse (who up to this point had no idea that gruffalos actually existed) comes across an honest-to-goodness gruffalo. The gruffalo is delighted to see the mouse (quote unquote, &quot;My favorite food!&quot;) and the small rodent must come up with a way to escape this new hitherto unthought of danger.<br /><br /> The story reminded me of the old fable about the boy and the giant. You've probably heard it at one point or another. In the story the boy convinces the giant (though delicate trickery) that he, not the giant, is the strongest creature on earth. This story is very similar to that idea, with the mouse convincing the gruffalo that he is the reason the fox, owl, and snake run away when the two of them approach. The text is definitely bouncy and fun and the whole book is written in rhyme. There's not a single line of text in this puppy that doesn't scan either, so the book's a fabulous read-aloud. It's great reading the smug mouse's, &quot;Silly old Fox! Does he know? There's no such thing as a gruffalo!&quot; Author Julia Donaldson (who also wrote the fabulous you-must-check-it-out &quot;Spiffiest Giant in Town&quot;) mentions in her author bio that originally she envisioned this story with a tiger. But it's hard to come up with many rhymes for tiger (Geiger?) so she changed her mind and invented the gruffalo instead. It's a far superior choice. Rounding out the story are Mr. Scheffler's great great illustrations. The small mouse protagonist never looks particularly scared by the dangerous situations he finds himself in. I also have a soft spot in my heart for any picture book character that regularly stands about with his arms crossed behind his back oh-so-casually. But that's just me.<br /><br /> A fine bit of storytelling with lovely illustrations and an enjoyable plot. I doubt very much you'll ever find anyone who dislikes &quot;The Gruffalo&quot;. I'm not saying it's impossible, but it's definitely unlikely. If you'd like a fun story to read aloud to one, two, or twenty youngsters, this might be an excellent choice.

In the world of children's books they're less common but not necessarily unheard of. Heck, Walter Dean Myers's &quot;Monster&quot; is a good example of that. But how common is the unreliable narrator who tells a story over the course of thirteen books, growing less and less reliable as time goes by? Part of what I like so much about &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; is the fact that our author, Lemony Snicket, is becoming more and more important to the Baudelaire orphans on a personal level. Heck, in &quot;The Hostile Hospital&quot; we even see a photograph of him in the story! But I get ahead of myself...<br /><br /> In this latest adventure, the Baudelaire orphans have, for the first time, found themselves without a guardian. You can decide if that's a good or bad thing for yourself (especially when you consider some of the awful places they've found themselves in the past). For the Baudelaires, they probably view it as a bad thing. After all, they're on the run from the law. Falsely accused of murdering Count Olaf (who is alive and well and currently tracking the kids down yet again) they find themselves taking brief refuge in the Heimlich Hospital. There, they start working in the Library of Records, a huge space filled with file cabinets containing all kinds of information. While there the three discover a file entitled &quot;Baudelaire&quot; containing information that raises some very peculiar ideas about the fire that destroyed their home and (possibly) their parents. But when Violet is captured by Olaf and his troupe of horrible actors, it's up to the two remaining orphans to save their brainy sister.<br /><br /> The kids have faced some awful misses in the series before. Yet I think that the horrible fate awaiting Violet in this particular tale is really the worse yet, though. Just a glace at the cover will give you an idea of what faces the pretty fourteen year old. I loved how the mystery of VFD, the Snickets, and Olaf's penchant for fires has started coming to a head. Certainly there are five more Baudelaire stories to be told after this one, but in &quot;Hostile Hospital&quot; you start getting the distinct feeling that Lemony may not be a particularly unbiased author. For genuine edge of your seat thrills, this book is truly exciting. Before my beddy bye I was going to stop reading for the night around page 129 but found that the tale was impossible to put down. I didn't stop reading until 255. I also kept jumping back to my &quot;Unauthorized Autobiography of Lemony Snicket&quot; to try to piece the different clues together that I had found. Very slowly a frightening portrait is emerging. It's delightful.<br /><br /> For any kid that loves either this series or just mysteries in general, &quot;The Hostile Hospital&quot; delivers. Is it miserable? Oh yes, entirely. It's also great reading.loved how the mystery of VFD, the Snickets, and Olaf's penchant for fires has started coming to a head.

When I'm 90 I'll be lucky if I can determine how one uses a ballpoint pen, but Steig was always an original. His books have been read by pretty much every child since the dawn of time and his stories have a kind of eerie continuous popularity that's undeniable. With &quot;Pete's a Pizza&quot;, Steig tells a story of a game that he used to play with his children when the weather was rough.<br /><br /> Pete's sad. He was going to play ball with his friends but the weather is awful outside. As Pete lies on the couch, miserable, his dad decides the only thing to be done is to make Pete into a pizza. First he kneads Pete, then he stretches him, then he twirls him in the air (cause that's what all great pizza makers do to their dough). A little oil, flour, and tomatoes as well as cheese and then it's into the oven (the couch). Then the pizza's done and needs to be cut, and before you know it the sun has come up and Pete can go outside and play with his friends.<br /><br /> It's just so doggone sweet. And not in that fake saccharine way either. Nope, this tale is just a very tender tale of a father trying to cheer his son up any silly way he can. It works of course, and you get the feeling that as Pete runs off to play with his fellows, he does so knowing that he's been loved. Pete's father's great, not afraid to chase and hug his boy when the moment calls for it. There are also spots of typical Steigian humor as well. When Pete's mom tickles him and his father informs him that &quot;pizzas are not supposed to laugh&quot;, Pete replies (a little peevishly), &quot;Pizza-makers are not supposed to tickle their pizzas!&quot; Hard to argue that point. I'm pleased to report also that Steig lost none of his customary skills with characters and situations in this tale. If I were to compare this story to a more recent picture book, I think I'd have to recommend, &quot;Climbing the Daddy Mountain&quot; by Jules Feiffer. Both books have the same kind of surreal silliness that appeals to kids and adults alike.<br /><br /> William Steig will be missed. He was one of those rare picture book authors that made you truly appreciate how silly the world could be sometimes. Fortunately, he left us some wonderful books, &quot;Pete's a Pizza&quot; being one of the best. It's a wonderful story that's both touching and tenderly made.

The right reader is the one who is (or once was) into the quirky, crazy, and bizarre. Anyone who's ever felt at any time that sometimes life is just too darn frumpy should read this story. For me, &quot;Weetzie Bat&quot; won me over when its protagonist and her best friend went to see &quot;The Girl Can't Help It&quot; starring Jayne Mansfield. Any book that mentions that splendid splendid movie (it's right up there with &quot;Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?&quot;) has my unequivocal love. If you like books that create little worlds where reality is rarely fixed and true love conquers all (eventually) then you'll enjoy taking a wild and wacky run through the insatiable &quot;Weetzie Bat&quot;.<br /><br /> Weetzie lives in L.A. and has just met a very cool guy named Dirk. The two are perfectly suited for one another in every way. Dirk wears his hair in a black mohawk and drives a '55 Pontiac. Weetzie sometimes wears feathered Indian headdresses and sometimes makes her clothes out of kids' bed sheets. Together they paint the town red and have wonderful times. When Dirk confesses to Weetzie that he's gay she's delighted. Now the two can go Duck hunting. But finding the right Duck is hard, and after too many bad dates and bad Ducks (which is pretty much the same thing) the two feel bad. Weetzie's one goal is to find her Secret Agent Lover Man. Then, one day unexpectedly, she's given three wishes. After being told that world peace and &quot;a million more wishes&quot; never really work she wishes for a Duck for Dirk, a Secret Agent Lover Man for herself, and a house for them all to live happily ever after in. When the wishes start coming true, things start getting REALLY interesting.<br /><br /> Author Francesca Lia Block is a big fan of sentences that use the word &quot;and&quot;. Here's a typical Block sentence: &quot;They all lived together and wore red and ate plantain and black beans, or wonton soup and fortune cookies, and made silkscreened clothing they sold on the boardwalk at Venice beach&quot;. She's a fan of the extravagant explanation and the outrageous description. If you're reading this book in the right mood, they're great. I found myself loving portions of this book, much to my surprise. Consider the following sentences, appearing after Weetzie gets a really good kiss: &quot;A kiss about apple pie a la mode with the vanilla creaminess melting in the pie heat. A kiss about chocolate, when you haven't eaten chocolate in a year.

I had been under the impression that the author had taken classic nursery rhymes and updated them significantly so that they'd be approachable by today's kids. Instead, I found that the rhymes have stayed pretty much exactly the same. What Nina Crews has done is compliment each rhyme with heavily Photoshopped images of modern urban kids having a grand old time. Sometimes these work brilliantly. Sometimes they look sadly fake. There's a good example of both on pages 14 and 15. I was especially taken with the picture that comes with the poem that begins, &quot;Cobbler, cobbler, mend my shoe&quot;. In the accompanying photograph a boy stands outside a modern shoe repair store, the handmade sign standing out front. Unfortunately, the photo extends to the opposite page where a boy is pulling fishies out of his ear for a different poem. The cobbler poem was a great way of introducing kids to an older poem as well as teaching them the meaning of the term, &quot;cobbler&quot;. The fish poem... not so much.<br /><br /> Nina Crews really has found a grand cast of kids in this book, though. The girl who runs away from the potentially skeezy Georgie Porgie does so with real pep and verve. I loved the girls doing the hand rhyme to the classic &quot;Pat-a-cake&quot; poem and I loved the lady on the merry-go-round who embodied the lady with &quot;Rings on her fingers and bells on her toes&quot;. Crews has brought the color and variety of New York to the printed page, and that's not an easy job. But for every fabulous merry-go-round photograph there's a poorly created Jack jumping over an enormous cupcake/candlestick.<br /><br /> I get a little sad when I think about how it's possible that the kids in these photographs will probably look fairly dated in ten years or less. Yet even more depressing is how dated the photoshopping is today. I think the book was better in idea than in execution. Still, this could easily be one of the best ways to get today's children interested in yesterday's rhymes. And I think there are enough fabulous poems and photos in here to make up for the poor ones. Definitely check this puppy out if you've the time. It's an interesting experiment in modern storytelling.cution.

You could probably fill a library with the amount of books written about the events of September 11, 2001. For his own part, author Wilborn Hampton decided to write about that day in way that speaks to younger readers. Setting the age group ready for this book at about middle school onwards, Hampton tells a variety of different but true stories that took place on that day. In this book, the narrative is split between eight different groups of people. As the day progresses, some of the people presented are left in limbo, others escape their fate unscathed, and at least one person dies. When you write a book about this subject you're almost guaranteed that your tale will not be boring. The real question is, how well do you tell the events of that day with the respect they deserve? Hampton gives his story just the right amount of gravitas without plunging the narratives into hopeless despair. It's a delicate balancing act that he gets juuuust right.<br /><br /> The book is split into five sections. There is the Introduction, then chapters entitled, &quot;The Attack&quot;, &quot;Flight&quot;, &quot;The Aftermath&quot;, and &quot;Epilogue&quot;. We meet Jim Kenworthy and his wife Ginger Ormiston who both worked in the towers. We hear the story of Omar Rivera, a blind man that was in the 71st floor of the North Tower. We follow a squad of firefighters from Ladder Company 6, Rudy Giuliani, and even the author himself. Each story lends another glimpse into what was going on that day. With this method of storytelling, Hampton can gives us the point of view of people inside the towers when the planes hit, outside on the streets below, and at home watching television (as most of us were that day). He doesn't sacrifice narrative tension in the course of telling his story, and I appreciated that. The one part of the book I might have asked to have removed might be the section that follows hijacker Mohamed Atta that day. Though it's a good idea to show someone who instigated the day's horror (and Hampton fortunately doesn't enter into the mind of Atta at any point) he's the only Muslim in this book we ever see. In fact, of all the narratives in this tale, there is only one other person of color mentioned (and she appears as one of seven characters in her tale). A little more diversity would have been nice, especially since people from so many different races and creeds died that day.<br /><br /> In a way, I also wish that Wilborn Hampton's dedication to his child on the publication page was blown up and given more attention in the text. In this dedication Hampton says, &quot;We did not pay enough heed to a divide that opened between the needy and the complacent; we did not listen with enough attention to the cries of frustration and despair from the other side. That divide opened into a chasm of enmity that led to the terrible events that occurred on September 11. It will be the task of your generation to begin building a bridge across this gulf of hatred. Hatred is born of fear. Do not be afraid&quot;. You could read this entire book and miss that tiny eloquent and ultimately true passage in its front. At least it's there if you know where to look.<br /><br /> The book contains a map of lower Manhattan, numerous black and white photographs, a Bibliography, a Filmography, and a good Index. Hampton has taken care to back up his sources and include many first hand accounts. The result is a multi-layered non-fiction text that any teen living in America today should read. After all, it outlines a day that has since affected American living in general and America's faith in its own security in particular. To understand what's going to happen, you need a book that explains what already has.

They can range from the insipid &quot;Baby Duck&quot; books to the eloquent and insightful &quot;Wilfrid Gordon McDonald Partridge&quot;. &quot;Oma's Quilt&quot; is a little different than other kid + senior citizen stories partly because its focus rests squarely on the adult and not on the child. Tackling a subject that more and more adults must face every year, &quot;Oma's Quilt&quot; shows what it takes to make a new home a familiar one.<br /><br /> Emily's grandmother (or &quot;Oma&quot;) is moving from her house into a retirement community. The reader gets the distinct impression that this was not Oma's idea and she's not especially keen to leave. After all, she's lived in her house for most of her lifetime. When Emily and her mother go to the Forest View Retirement Home, Oma is not very receptive. She thinks the food is odd, the bed uncomfortable, and the other people in the home &quot;nincompoops&quot;. Sensing that the transition is probably going to need a little work, Emily and her mother try to figure out a way to help Oma. Yet it isn't until they sort through the woman's old clothes that Emily comes up with a brilliant solution. Why not make a quilt out of all the old fabrics for Oma to use and remember with? Together, they make one and Oma is delighted. On it she's able to point out the moments of her life that meant the most to her and to pass them on to her kin. By the end, Oma still thinks the other residents are nincompoops, but she's started helping in the kitchen and her old friend Mrs. Mostowyk may be moving in soon. Things are looking up.<br /><br /> I found it odd that the story gave so little attention to Emily's thoughts and feelings. Heck, we hear more about how her mom feels about Oma's bad mood (at one point she's on the brink of tears) than we do about Emily. For those kids that are close to their grandparents, however, this book may be much loved. Personally, I was a little put off by Oma's overwhelmingly bad mood, but it only lasts (at its worst) for a couple pages and she's cheery enough by the end. I certainly did appreciate that by the tale's finish, Oma hadn't suddenly undergone some kind of a spellbinding conversion to retirement home wonders. Instead, she still dislikes her neighbors but is beginning to become comfortable with other aspects of her new life. The story is a focused patient exploration of what it takes to make another person happy. In this case, it takes a wealth of memories.<br /><br /> The illustrations in this story work beautifully. Oma's a shrewd woman with a penchant for bright colorful prints, extravagant hats, and saddleshoes. Using pen and watercolors, illustrator Stephane Jorisch brings a great deal of life and verve to the tale. Emotions are well displayed here. When Oma sits hunched in her armchair complaining about the flowers in the hallway and the home's funky smelling bowling shoes she's every bit the cantankerous grandmother. But I think my favorite spread shows Oma, her daughter, and her granddaughter leaning on the new glorious quilt. As we watch, the quilt is filled with an array of colorful, shifting, melding memories. A married couple walks towards a large city while opposite them a man pushes a baby carriage. It's an impressive array and it sums up the state of Oma's mind perfectly.<br /><br /> If you've a kid that will enjoy a story about a grandmother and not, in fact, that woman's grandchild then this story is for you. It's definitely worth a look see. I advise you to examine it thoroughly and figure out if it's worth your time. Personally, I thought it was nice without being particularly universal. Those children that don't have grandparents may not identify with the tale intrinsically. Otherwise, it rivals the aforementioned &quot;Wilfrid Gorden McDonald Partridge&quot;'s attention to the importance of memory (though of the two I cast my lot with &quot;Wilfrid&quot;). Enjoy.with &quot;Wilfrid&quot;). Enjoy. <br />	2004-07-27

Don't believe me? Try clicking on her name to pull up a list of the books she's written. Then take a gander at the literally hundreds (if not, dare I say it, thousands) of books alive today because of her. It's a bit of a relief then that at least one of them won the Caldecott Medal. &quot;Owl Moon&quot; deserved it too. It is a sweet yet not overly sentimental tale about a nighttime owling trip taken by a girl and her father.<br /><br /> In this tale we first get a spectacular view from above (owl's eye view, I should say) of a small farm in the country. Two figures leave the warm home to tramp in the snow. The moon is brightly lit above so that (as the book says), &quot;the sky seemed to shine&quot;. The girl has never been owling before but she understands the rules intrinsically. One must be especially quiet on these occasions. Once in a while the girl's father calls a deep, &quot;Whoo-whoo-who-who-whooooooo&quot; into the woods, but he does not receive a reply. They walk on through the cold until they come to a clearing in the woods where the snow is so clean and pure that it looks like a bowl of milk. The father hoots again and this time receives an answer. An owl comes closer and closer, finally landing on a nearby branch just as the father shines his flashlight on it. There, the reader sees a magnificent two page spread of an owl, its large wings open beside it, regarding the girl and her parent. Then it's off and the adventure is done. Says the girl, &quot;I was a shadow as we walked home&quot;.<br /><br /> A couple remarkable occurrences marked the creation of this book. Jane Yolen's husband would often go owling with their three children, and she felt (quite rightly) that it would make a great picture book. By coincidence, illustrator John Schoenherr was an owling fellow himself. And though he had given up book illustrating in favor of his own personal paintings, Schoenherr was convinced to try his hand one more time with &quot;Owl Moon&quot;. The fact of the matter is, it's a very good thing he did. Though the story in this book is lovely and telling, the pictures really bring it to life. You can read a sentence like, &quot;I could feel the cold, as if someone's icy hand was palm-down on my back&quot;, but its only going to strike home if the accompanying picture is appropriate and evocative. Here, fortunately, Schoenherr excels. It must be very difficult to paint nighttime scenes that are lit by snow-reflecting moonlight, yet the book displays this very particular style perfectly. Now to be perfectly frank, I found myself grumbling for about half this book about its medal. I thought the pictures were lovely but I hadn't yet seen anything that really stood out or took my breath away. Then I came to the aforementioned two-page spread of the owl sitting on a branch. In that single picture Schoenherr completely gives away how talented he is. The owl is completely realistic yet overwhelmingly majestic. There's energy and life to this bird as it crouches in the unfamiliar light. For the girl and her father, the simple act of seeing this animal as close as this makes the entire trip worthwhile. Schoenherr understands this, and so the picture makes reading the entire book just as worthwhile as well.<br /><br /> The text is quiet and elegant, the watercolors evocative and intense. For the bedtime story that is realistic while retaining fantastical elements, this book is an excellent choice. Consider it highly recommended all around.

When I decided to see what all the fuss surrounding Mr. Paul Zindel was about, I should have just read &quot;The Pigman&quot; immediately. Instead, I read his far less accomplished (and, these days, horribly dated) &quot;My Darling, My Hamburger&quot;. Having come to the conclusion that Zindel was fine if slightly overrated, I then moved onto &quot;The Pigman&quot;. Once I finished it, I realized my mistake. Zindel WAS an accomplished young adult writer. Heck, he was one of the granddaddys of the genre. And &quot;The Pigman&quot; is a fabulous book. Depressing? Heck, yeah. But fabulous.<br /><br /> The heroes (so to speak) of this little work of art are John and Lorraine. Sophomores in high school, the book jumps between their narratives. This book is their &quot;memorial epic&quot;, dedicated to their adventures with the man they call The Pigman. As the story plays out, it becomes clear that neither of them are the most reliable of narrators. Coming from unhappy homes, the two friends fill their days with idle games. By complete accident they meet the acquaintance of one Angelo Pignati a.k.a. &quot;The Pigman&quot;. A lonely old man whose only friend is an ugly baboon at the zoo, Pignati slowly befriends the reluctant teens. Through his kindness, the kids begin to experience a little more happiness than they've felt anywhere else. But when Pignati places his trust in the two, they betray him and Pignati's world is destroyed. Cheery fun!<br /><br /> Actually, I'm usually pretty anti-depressing books. There are just too darn many of them out there these days. When I was a teen I avoided them like the plague and I suspect that's partially why I missed &quot;The Pigman&quot; in the first place. Reading it today, I was surprised by the humor in it. John and Lorraine (the women's names in this book really drill home its original 1968 copyright date) are goofballs through and through. Whether they're prank calling, roller skating through the Pigman's dining room, or noshing on chocolate covered ants, this kids have a ball. John's the compulsive liar of the two while Lorraine psychoanalyzes anyone who gets within a hair's breath of her. One of the things I liked the most about this story was that their relationship remains fairly steady. There's a bit of awkwardness after the two kiss at one moment, but for the most part they're just good friends who need one another badly. I suspect the sequel to this book, &quot;The Pigman's Legacy&quot;, probably plumbs their interactions a little further, but that's just a guess.<br /><br /> On the whole, the book is most remarkable because it still speaks clearly to teens today. Who isn't going to understand about the fun that can be had with a house party, booze, and a band? Or the two-faced nature of many an adult? Just update a couple phrases here, a word there, an appliance yonder, and you could probably publish this story as a very modern creation.<br /><br /> A tip of the hat to Paul Zindel then. A word of advice: If you would like to learn more about this wonderful author, begin with &quot;The Pigman&quot;. This book was groundbreaking in its day and it remains a funny and sad paean to the death of teen-age innocence.he Pigman's dining room, or noshing on chocolate covered ants, this kids have a ball.

If anyone walks up to you today and complains loudly in your face about the recent rise of the &quot;sequel&quot; in popularity, stuff a copy of &quot;Rewards and Fairies&quot; in their face and beg them to know their sequel history. Written as a kind of Part Two to Kipling's previous hit, &quot;Puck of Pook's Hill&quot;, &quot;Rewards and Fairies&quot; continues where its predecessor left off. Like the first book, &quot;Rewards&quot; once again follows the tame adventures of little Dan and Una as their adventures with Puck (of &quot;Midsummer Night's Dream&quot; fame) give them new insights into England's fabulous past.<br /><br /> Once again our unlikely heroes (and their unlikely guide) are visited by some relatively obscure but important members of England's great moments. These include everything from a lady of Queen Elizabeth I's court to a half-English half-French smuggler from the years of the French Revolution. Though the stories in this book vary incredibly in quality, Kipling has extended his narrative by quite a bit. Suddenly the kids are meeting a caveman that gave his own eye for a knife and consequently ended up a god amongst his people. Going completely overboard, Kipling includes a smuggler that tells a story about his travels amongst the Seneca of North America. His tale praises (of all people) President George Washington, making the man out to be just shy of a saint. I doubt very much that there are American works of fiction out there that praise our first president even half as much as Kipling's book does here. Some of the characters from the previous book reappear in this one for a brief encore. Once again we meet Harry Dawe, the stonemason who was knighted by King Henry VIII for saving him thirty pounds. There's Sir Richard Dalyngridge again, telling the last and most drawn out boring tale in the lot. In Harry's case, his reappearance is an extension of his somewhat foreshortened previous adventures. In Sir Richard's case, there is no such excuse.<br /><br /> There are things to love in this book, of course. The poems are just shy of brilliant here and there. It's difficult to keep yourself from singing them once in a while. They're just so doggone rhythmic. And there's a lot of humor in these stories too. Puck at one point introduces the kids to an overly affected astrologer who saved a village from the plague (he had the right methods but the wrong reasons). Then there are lines in this book that could keep you awake and twisting for days. How quickly can you say, &quot;I tell you now that a faith which takes care that every man shall keep faith, even though he may save his soul by breaking faith, is the faith for a man to believe in&quot;? Even better, how quickly can you understand it? The book also gives chummy nicknames to some of the world's most infamous men. Suddenly Napolean Bonaparte is being referred to as &quot;Boney&quot; and Sir Francis Drake is reduced to a mere, &quot;Frankie&quot;.<br /><br /> The best way to tell if you'll enjoy &quot;Rewards and Fairies&quot; is to read &quot;Puck of Pook's Hill First&quot;. If you read that one and enjoyed it then you should have virtually zippo problems with this later creation. Personally, I loved it. I thought it was a great little English History 101 (though I can't exactly remember the difference between the Normans and the Saxons anymore). If you read everything with the exception of the last chapter, I think you'll find it undeniably charming. And who knew Puck enjoyed hearing about business transactions?

In this world there are picture books written for every worry, hope, fear, and joy a child could conceive of. One of the more realistic dramas children face is the appearance of a new sibling. Now, there are some great picture books out there on the subject. There's &quot;Ginger&quot; by Charlotte Voake and &quot;Julius, the Baby of the World&quot; by Kevin Henkes, but long before either of these modern classics were written there was &quot;The Chick and the Duckling&quot;. It's a kind of sibling-worship tale taken to its logical extreme and illustrated by the incredible Jose and Ariane Aruego.<br /><br /> One day a duckling hatches out of its shell with a triumphant, &quot;I am out!&quot;. Immediately following out of its own shell is a small chick who is quick to add, &quot;Me too&quot;. For every action the duckling takes, the chick is right behind to copy. If the duckling wishes to find a worm, the chick finds the same one. If the duckling wants to catch a butterfly, the chick catches one too. Finally the duckling announces its intention of going for a swim. Quicker than you can say, &quot;Me too&quot;, the chick (having forgotten, I guess, that chicks are not waterfowl) sinks to the bottom of the pond. Patiently the duckling retrieves the sodden ball of yellow fuzz before announcing, &quot;I'm going for another swim&quot;. &quot;Not me&quot;, replies the wiser and now butterfly-distracted chick.<br /><br /> This book could probably be a good way of letting younger siblings know to give their older adored brothers and sisters a little breathing space now and again. After all, they don't want to end up like a half-drowned chicken, do they? What is interesting in this story is that the duckling at no point shows even the slightest annoyance with its close yellow shadow. The duck even goes so far as to rescue its oppressor, leading to a happy ending for one and all. If the book strikes a familiar cord with you, it may be because this pairing of Russian author V. Suteyev and the Aruego illustrators is not a new one. An equally interesting and delightful creation is their intriguing, &quot;Mushroom in the Rain&quot;, which I highly recommend. Illustrator Jose Aruego also created the slightly better known, &quot;Leo the Late Bloomer&quot;, a book which has been comforting the slow learners of the world for years and years. In this particular outing, the Aruegos have not imbued this book with as much color or originality as &quot;Leo&quot;. Just the same, there is a great deal of life and humor to the pictures. From the bright and colorful pink, yellow, and orange flowers that cluster in the fields to the pink, purple, and orange butterflies that dot the skies, the book is awash in movement, energy, and color.<br /><br /> A classic to its bones, &quot;The Chick and the Duckling&quot; remains in the readers' mind long after the tale has ended. A delightful way to teach kids about space, siblings, and getting along with others. Fine frolicsome reading.oes so far as to rescue its oppressor, leading to a happy ending for one and all.

Before I even knew that this book existed I used to play a great game with my fellow kidlets. Everyone got onto the bed and someone below the bed was a huge alligator named Al. The goal was to stick your head over the side of the bed and yell, &quot;Hey, Al!&quot;, and avoid getting grabbed. When I saw the book, &quot;Hey, Al&quot;, I was disappointed to find that there weren't any alligators involved. The similarities to my favorite game were limited, but there was one thing that was the same. That heart stopping feeling you got when you stuck your head over the side, not knowing what you'd find or when you'd get grabbed... that's the feeling you get after reading, &quot;Hey, Al&quot;.<br /><br /> Al's just your normal janitor living with his dog in a one room apartment in New York. As the book says, he's, &quot;a nice man, a quiet man, a janitor&quot;. Eddie, Al's dog and partner, is fed up with their life at the moment but there isn't much the two can do about it. One day, while Al's shaving in the bathroom, a huge blue bird sticks its head in the window. The bird promises that if Al merely comes with him he'll find a place without any worries and cares. The next day, Al and Eddie wait patiently in the bathroom and the bird arrives to fly them up up up to an island in the sky. Once there the two eat and drink and swim and sunbathe all day. It's a little paradise. But this world starts to go terribly terribly wrong when Al wakes up one day to find that both he and Eddie are turning into birds. Suddenly the honeymoon is over and the two friends must fly for their lives back to their little apartment in New York to return to normal. In the end, the two friends are a little wiser and a little happier with their lot.<br /><br /> Author Arthur Yorinks and illustrator Richard Egielski were great fans of the weird dream-like picture book. I don't know if you're at all familiar with their similarly peculiar and far more odd &quot;Louis the Fish&quot;, but &quot;Hey, Al&quot; is written (and drawn) in very much the same vein. I was slightly disturbed by &quot;Hey, Al&quot; when I read it as a kid and that feeling has persisted in the eighteen years since I last looked at it. I think illustrator Egielski gives a nod to the otherworldly island paradise Al and Eddie end up in when he draws into his scene of birds welcoming the visitors a dodo with human hands and a walking stick (much as you would find in the original Tenniel drawing of &quot;Alice's Adventures in Wonderland&quot;). Somehow the combination of bright colors and an ever so slightly off narrative gives the book that otherworldly quality that made it so unique when it was first published. The range of birds available on the island (everything from ostriches and pink flamingos to penguins and puffins) help as well.<br /><br /> Kids will love speculating whether or not the other birds on the sunny isle were once human too. What is clear in the end, however, is the small still moral that staying true to one's self is better than all the riches in the world. The final line in the book is the undeniable statement, &quot;Paradise lost is sometimes Heaven found&quot;. A little light philosophy for a toddler's growing mind.far more odd &quot;Louis the Fish&quot;, but &quot;Hey, Al&quot; is written (and drawn) in very much the same vein.

576611:US	49148452	R1AKKA7GT6RE85	1561452084	264668164	Yellow Star, the: The Legend of King Christian X of Denmark	Books	2	39	59	N	N	Now what exactly is the road to hell paved with again?	If you were unaware of the history behind &quot;The Yellow Star&quot;, you might find the idea of a negative review of this book distasteful. After all, what kind of cold-hearted lizard would be so cruel as to give a poor rating to a book that speaks about a king's love of his countrymen? What sort of sad sack of garbage would put down a story in which all persons, regardless of religion, are treated as human beings by their benevolent king? I mean, for a person to do such a thing they'd have to have a very very good reason. They'd have to feel, for example, that the book was a travesty against the very people it's attempting to praise. Such a reviewer am I. And such a terrible book is &quot;The Yellow Star&quot;.<br /><br /> Allow me to sum it up. As stated in the title, this tale is the legend of King Christian X of Denmark. A noble man, his subjects loved him dearly and he always made wise decisions. One day, however, the Nazis came. Though Christian was able to stave off their insistence that the Nazi flag fly high, he was powerless against an edict that would force all Jews to wear the yellow star. After much soul searching and pondering, King Christian came up with a brilliant solution. The next day, while riding his horse amongst the people as usual, the king sported a yellow star of his own. And in time all the Danish people did the same.<br /><br /> Ah, you say. What an inspiring story. What a swell testament to such a strong man and his convictions. What a... WHAT? You're telling me it isn't true? Nope. As it happens you may have missed the word &quot;legend&quot; in the subtitle. Now there was a King Christian of Denmark, yes. And he was a good king. Why, a simple reading of the excellent &quot;Number the Stars&quot; (a book that the author of this tale mentions in her Author's Note, none to my surprise) will prove that much. And sadly, &quot;Number the Stars&quot;, though a fiction, is far more truthful than this particular creation. Now don't get me wrong. The author freely admits in the Author's Note that this story isn't true. I wonder how many parents regularly read such notes to their kids after reading this story... hm. I wonder how many adults would even bother with an Author's Note themselves? Author Deedy writes that this book is supposed to be a &quot;what if?&quot; story. She then lists the actions the Danes actually took against the oppressive Nazis. It's as if their actual efforts weren't enough. Who cares if they smuggled 7,000 Jews to Sweden? Who cares that of the 500 deported only 51 died? Let's write a fairy tale instead where ALL the Jews were perfectly safe because their big hearted king saved them, the end. What kind of person looks at human suffering and the heroics that went into saving a group from destruction and then says, &quot;It wasn't enough. I need to make a story where the king did even more&quot;? Not only is this insulting to the very people you're trying to commemorate, but you've just treated their accomplishments as paltry. This book is a slap in the face to every Dane that actually saved a Jewish life. It says to them, &quot;Ah yes, you were fine, but what if you'd done THIS?&quot;. It makes me sick. And when Deedy lists the Danes accomplishments in her Author's Note, how do you know what she writes is true? She never quotes a single source or backs up any of her facts with reliable resources. She could be making up every word in this book (rather than every other word) and we'd never be the wiser.<br /><br /> For a fun time, check out some of the professional reviews of this picture book. If you look on the back cover of &quot;Yellow Star&quot; you may see a quote from School Library Journal that says, &quot;Deed's language is simple and rhythmic... This is an interesting and thought-provoking piece of work&quot;. Here's the rest of that review that you didn't see. &quot;Readers are sure to be disappointed to find out that it is legend, and not verified history.-Martha Link, Louisville Free Public Library, KY&quot;. Truthfully, when a book decides that it's going to tell a &quot;what if&quot; story about something as black and horrific as the Holocaust, it makes that event small and easy to ignore. A note on the back of the book says that this story, &quot;will involve elementary age children in this legend while exposing them to harsh truths&quot;. No it won't. Give your children Roberto Innocenti's, &quot;Rose Blanche\\". Give them the exquisite and far preferable \\"Number the Stars&quot;. Heck, give them Dr. Seuss's &quot;Yertle the Turtle&quot;. Every one of these books is a better written and far more respectful treatment of injustice at the hands of the powerful and none of them pretend to be non-fiction. &quot;The Yellow Star&quot; insults the memory of those remarkable Danish people that risked it all to save their friends and neighbors.

576620:US	49148452	R2861ZV1C69U8G	0375826904	740940466	Halibut Jackson	Books	5	30	31	N	N	Action Jackson	Sometimes I like to believe that the truly great picture books out there are the ones written by author/illustrators that have studied children's literature for years and years. I would imagine that they slaved to make the &quot;good&quot; picture book after many attempted (and failed) tries. Then finally, after years and years of effort, a picture book would come into fruition that epitomizes everything that the picture books of the past have led to. Then an author like David Lucas comes along and, in his first picture book, creates something as deeply original and wonderful as &quot;Halibut Jackson&quot; and my entire theory goes ka-blooey. &quot;Halibut Jackson&quot; is, to my mind, one of the finest picture books that I have had the pleasure of reading in a long long time. Simultaneously beautiful and detailed, the story is reminiscent of older picture books some forty years back. It's well worth a peek.<br /><br /> Halibut Jackson is a shy fellow. When he finds himself in a public situation where he must interact with other people, Halibut freaks. To avoid this problem, he has constructed clever clothing that blend into any situation. If he wants to go a-walking amongst the daisies, he merely slips on his flower covered poncho. If it's a trip to the library on his mind instead, on goes the book covered clothing. Everything is going perfectly well until one day Halibut gets an invitation to the palace for the very first time. Halibut wants to go, but the idea of being around so many party guests doesn't appeal to him. That next day he constructs a suit covered in silver, gold, and jewels, assuming he'll fit right in and never be noticed. But what Halibut didn't reckon with was that this was a garden party. Suddenly he's the center of attention, and everyone wants him to construct clothing for them. With this encouragement, Halibut goes into business, creating crazy clothing for every person's needs. Says the book, &quot;And although he was still a little shy, it seemed not to matter so very much at all&quot;.<br /><br /> The story may not blow you away after reading it, but the illustrations in this puppy are to die for. Halibut Jackson himself walks around wearing clothing that, at times, look as if the author/illustrator was simply tracing a protractor for a design. I loved that despite the somewhat old-fashioned feeling of this tale (it's something about the use of lines and colors, I guess) the cast of characters that Halibut encounters is wonderfully raucously multi-racial. Heck, the king's black and the queen's white cementing this tale as definitely a twenty-first century picture book. I also loved the intricate details that fill the pages. Every spread features pictures that fight and contend with one another for the reader's attention. My favorite scene was of Mr. Jackson's clothing store at the end. By this point the shy tailor has truly let his imagination run wild. There's a suit that resembles the sun, a dress (with matching swan hat) of Monet's waterlilies, and a cot that's filled with a million different people.<br /><br /> Nostalgia is selling quite a lot of picture books these days. Adults are looking wistfully at their own favorites and trying to find modern creations that look and feel like such books as, &quot;Make Way for Ducklings&quot; or &quot;Andy and the Lion&quot;. I think what &quot;Halibut Jackson&quot; does so well is that it captures the feeling we get from reading older picture books, but not the unfortunate stereotypes of the time period. Though steeped in old-fashioned storytelling techniques, this is truly a modern concoction that kids today will adore.it seemed not to matter so very much at all&quot;.  <br />  <br /> The story may not blow you away after reading it, but the illustrations in this puppy are to die for.

They sometimes believe that this form of literature serves one single purpose. To help kids learn how to read. While an incredibly worthwhile goal (don't get me wrong), allow me to point out that pictures books are hardly so limited. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Vera B. Williams' picture/poetry book, &quot;Amber Was Brave, Essie Was Smart&quot;. Ms. Williams has tackled serious subjects in her books before (&quot;A Chair For My Mother&quot; anyone?) but this is the first time, to my memory, that she has tackled the very serious subject of a father's incarceration. There are probably millions of children in America with mothers or fathers in jail. This book may ease their burden just a bit.<br /><br /> Amber and Essie are two sisters that act just the way you'd expect them to. Amber is younger and tends to clutch her purple teddy bear Wilson to her for support. Essie is a little older and is in charge of watching her younger sibling. Their mother is usually away from the girls, earning a living while their father serves his jail term for check forgery. There isn't a lot to eat at home and the girls are constantly moving between sitters, but they know how to make life bearable. The book is cut into twenty-eight small poems that describe the story of the two girls. Some of these are funny like, &quot;Whoops&quot;, where the girls jump up and down on the bed until it (inevitably) collapses. Some of them are sad like, &quot;Conversations Under the Bed&quot;. In this poem Amber is crying and asking Wilson to tell her that her Daddy isn't really bad. &quot;Daddy couldn't really be bad because he's my daddy&quot;. If that doesn't make you sniffle a little then you're made of stronger stuff than I. And some of the poems in the book are both funny AND sad. &quot;There Stood Amber With Her Braids at Her Feet&quot;, is your typical humorous girls-trying-to-cut-their-own hair poem. But it ends with the stanzas, &quot;Only I had to cut them off/ Amber said/ to send to Daddy/ so he'll be sure to remember me/ I had to&quot;.<br /><br /> &quot;Amber Was Brave, Essie Was Smart&quot; has a happy ending (Daddy comes home after having finished his time and everyone's overjoyed) so don't worry about that. I think Vera B. Williams really should be commended for not only tackling the subject of jailed parents, but also the day to day trials of poverty. You can tell that the girls' mom is making due, but just barely. There are whole stories suggested in these little poems above and beyond what's written here. Now normally, I have to admit, I don't care too much for Vera B. Williams's illustrations. But the pictures in this book are perfect. They're all done in pencil, some colored, some not. Sometimes they're detailed and sometimes they're just the barest of outlines. The book comes with a &quot;photo album&quot; of the characters that kids will enjoy pawing through after reading the story. I think that if you've a child that can handle a little reality, this book is a more than appropriate companion. It tackles difficult grown-up problems in a manner that is not only understandable to children, but meaningful as well. Consider pairing it with the similar, &quot;Visiting Day&quot;, if you want another picture book on this topic.as, &quot;Only I had to cut them off/ Amber said/ to send to Daddy/ so he'll be sure to remember me/ I had to&quot;.  <br />  <br /> &quot;Amber Was Brave, Essie Was Smart&quot; has a happy ending (Daddy comes home after having finished his time and everyone's overjoyed) so don't worry about that.

Books	5	5	7	N	N	The original ogre	For some reason, when a book is made into a popular movie the public decides to pit the movie against the book on which it was based. The question on everyone's lips is, &quot;Was the movie better than the book? Is the book better than the movie?&quot; Not that it really matters. After all, books and movies are as different as different can be. When full length feature films are created out of picture books, they usually bear very little resemblance to the texts on which they were based. Now, for my part I'm one of the five people living in America today who did not like the movie &quot;Shrek&quot;. And this isn't because I loved the book. Honestly, until today I had never even read the thing. But I didn't like the movie's tone, it's writing, it's moral, or much in the way of its characters. To me, it was a film that should have been produced by Pixar, wasn't, and suffered for it. Then I decided, out of some sort of self-flagellation, to read the original picture book on which the movie was based. The picture book, I found, is awesome. So if a person were to foolishly pit movie against book, I guess I'd have to fall squarely into the book camp. It's a great anti-fairy tale tale.<br /><br /> As you may already know, Shrek is an awful ogre that lives with his mom and pop in a horrible swamp. One day his parents kick him out of the horrible place so that he can make his way in the world. After meeting with a nasty witch in a lovely hat, Shrek is told a fortune predicts that he will meet a donkey, defeat a knight, and marry a princess. While proceeding on his terrible quest, Shrek encounters a variety of mad adventures. He defeats a dragon, finds the aforementioned (non-jive talking) donkey, defeats the knight, and meets the ugliest princess in the world. After the two sing a little song (including such delightful rhymes as, &quot;Oh ghastly you/ With lips of blue/ Your ruddy eyes/ With carmine sties/ Enchant me&quot;) they find that they are made for one another and get &quot;hitched&quot; immediately. Note the bouquet of cactus the princess holds. Delightfully horrible.<br /><br /> This is one of Steig's later children's books, so it's no wonder I never heard of it until the movie came out. I think the blurb about this story I like best comes from Parenting Magazine who called this tale, &quot;A mischievous, topsy-turvy chronicle of a nasty ogre's wonder years&quot;. Unlike the movie, this book does not interact with fairy tale characters and the princess at the end does not resemble Princess Fiona in the least when he meets her. Also, Shrek is nasty all the way through. Unrepentantly catastrophically nasty. You won't find an ogre with low self-esteem here. Instead, he just likes being awful. You wouldn't want him any other way. Kids reading this book (that haven't seen the film) will delight in a character that's just as downright terrible as he wants to be. It's a great story with a great title character. If you've kids that have tired of the normal fairy tale drivel and want something along the lines of &quot;The Stinky Cheese Man&quot; or &quot;The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs&quot;, this is an excellent choice. For every kid, everywhere, at any time.get &quot;hitched&quot; immediately. Note the bouquet of cactus the princess holds.

Though published through a children's book publishing house, you cannot say that this is necessarily a book intended for the eyes of kids only. Anyone who has ever loved the WNBA, anyone who has a favorite player that is featured in this book, and anyone who loves poetry OR basketball will enjoy this book. A ribald collection of photographic images and odes to individual WNBA players, Charles R. Smith Jr. has created the ultimate loving tribute to twelve of his favorite muses.<br /><br /> First of all, I am not personally a WNBA fan. So in reviewing this book I can't tell you whether or not the twelve women featured in this book are the current top twelve players, the past top twelve players, or just random players that Smith thinks are especially talented. For each woman pictured here, Smith has written a poem. We begin with &quot;Fly Swatter&quot;, dedicated to the great height and skill of Margo Dydek. This poem, like all the others, shows a picture of the woman featured in sepia tones doing exactly what the poem says she's doing. So Tina Thompson's poem &quot;T 4 2&quot; shows her scoring a two-pointer while Nykesha Sales's, &quot;The Bomb&quot; shows the ultimate jump shot. The poems are written with a bouncy fast-paced style that's sure to please any burgeoning poet or sports fan. For example, a poem about Ticha Penicheiro says, &quot;Racing and running/and spinning and swerving/ in total control/ while feeding and serving/ delicious assists/ with wrist-flick tricks/ Chef T serves/ dishes with slick/ style and/ skill&quot;. They're all like that. Tricky enjoyable little spots of poetry that laud some of Smith's favorite players and talents.<br /><br /> In the back of the book Smith has included little bios of each player and the reason he wrote the poem he did for each. If the poems themselves were complimentary, these bios are positively worshipful. Still, I think what Smith has done here is give each person an individual identity. A lesser writer (or fan, for that matter) might be tempted to lump these women into a single group without individual personalities or traits. Smith works hard to display each person with the dignity and talent they so rightly possess.<br /><br /> The book's covers are apparently made of cardboard, which struck me as a little odd. Still, despite this bizarre packaging the book's a worthy addition to any sports fan's home. If you've been scouring the shelves for WNBA poetry and have found yourself coming up short, I believe you'll be happy to find this little number ready and waiting for you. It may not contain the most thought provoking poems in the world, but it accomplishes what it set out to do.

It's a small book when you first pick it up, and that's good. Because it's a small story. Not an unimportant story. Just one of the millions of stories that could be told about the citizens of New York everyday. Yet for such a small little puff of writing, &quot;The First Part Last&quot; carries a big punch. It won the Printz Award (the young adult equivalent of the Newbery) as well as the Coretta Scott King Award in 2004. No one who has read it through can find it in their hearts to lobby a hateful word against it. It is loving on the deepest level and it tells a story human beings have been telling amongst themselves for millennia. It is the story of a boy becoming a man.<br /><br /> The book is split into two narratives, both of them originating with the narrator, Bobby. In one narrative, Bobby is telling the story of &quot;Now&quot;. In this part, Bobby is sixteen years old and caring for his brand new baby girl. He's exhausted and worn out and jittery. All he wants to do is sleep but he has a brand new baby depending on him every hour of the day and it sometimes seems like it's more than he can bear. In the second narrative &quot;Then&quot; Bobby talks about how he and his girlfriend Nia discovered that she was pregnant and had to come to a decision about what to do with the baby. As the two narratives slowly come together, the reader begins to wonder certain things. For example, where's Nia all this time? Why isn't she helping Bobby take care of Feather (their baby)? And why didn't the two follow through with the idea of putting the child up for adoption? By the book's end everything is cleared up and Bobby has come the slow realization about who he is and what his role in the world has become.<br /><br /> The book is expertly written. Parts of it are true-to-life gritty while others verge on poetry itself. One of the best passages comes from Bobby's mother right at the beginning when she says, &quot;Put that baby down, Bobby. I swear she's going to think the whole world is your face. She's going to be scared out of her mind when she turns about six and you haven't put her down long enough to see any of it&quot;. Little meaningful passages like that one crop up all the time in this story. The choice of separating the book into Thens and Nows comes from Bobby wishing that people could learn everything there is to know at the beginning of their lives and die in innocence at the end. It's funny reading the book in this way, partly because Bobby grows to adulthood even as he flashes back to his self-absorbed childish ways before the baby.<br /><br /> If I have any objection to anything in this story (and honestly, what kind of a reviewer would I be if I found any book to be completely flawless?) it's probably a single chapter that is done in the voice of Nia. The chapter serves little purpose except perhaps to read as a kind of little goodbye. Unfortunately, it's not only confusing but also unnecessary. We've been doing perfectly well with Bobby as our hero and Bobby as our voice. Why drag Nia into it all of a sudden? Otherwise, the book's a pip. A real well written document about a teen-age father that loves his little daughter more than anything else in the world. He's real and wonderful. The fact that Johnson could write something as perfect as this in a mere 131 small pages is reason enough to swoon.whole world is your face.

And even if we haven't, we know the type. The ancient trickster sprite found in every land around the world is a common enough creature. In &quot;Puck of Pook's Hill&quot;, however, Rudyard Kipling establishes Puck as the very soul of England itself. Using Robin Goodfellow as a guide, Kipling is able to adeptly describe a range of important factors that lead to the glory of late nineteenth-century Britain. The result is an enchanting story featuring a beloved literary figure.<br /><br /> Two children living in England decide to act out a scene from &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot; on Midsummer Night itself in an old fairy ring of darkened grass. In so doing, the two accidentally conjure up Puck himself. Puck is as old as the land itself, and while all the other fairies and sprites have long left the land (all thanks to Henry the VIII as it happens) he remains. Over the course of the next months, Puck is able to bring figures from the English past to speak with the children and tell them stories. These figures include a knight carrying a runic sword, a Roman conqueror (born and raised in England, however), an artist, and a Jewish money lender who is responsible for the signing of the Magna Carta.<br /><br /> Admittedly, it would help to have a basic working knowledge of English history when approaching this text. Know your Saxons from your Normans. Understand the reasons the Picts hated the Romans (though Kipling is clearly on Rome's side in that struggle). Other details are easily filled in by the author himself, and Kipling is more than willing to use Puck to fill in gaps and misunderstandings for readers. The piece of land the book takes place on was the actual England land that Kipling himself owned at the time. The modern reader will find a couple usual stereotypes of the era. Africans are like children, ditto the Picts, and I won't even go into the Chinaman included. The Jews, by comparison, are shown a great deal of compassion by the author. Kadmiel (the Jew in question) is an impressive figure that speaks with more nobility than any other figure in the book. So kudos to Kipling for at least one interesting and three-dimensional minority. Bravo indeed.<br /><br /> Some will find this particular Kipling outing slow going. I, personally, thought the book was written quite well. I felt no shudders when I lifted the book up again to peruse it and despite its deceptively long length it's a quick read. Anyone who wishes to have a basic working knowledge of fairy doings in merry old England would do very well to give this piece of literature a look-see.naman included.

How often do we read books about geniuses that are appreciated? Not only appreciated by lauded? And not only lauded but miserable beyond belief? When author Orson Scott Card first wrote a full length book out of his short story &quot;Ender's Game&quot;, he could never have predicted the impact it would make. Since its conception, gifted children have read it on a personal level. Members of the military have viewed it as their epic. It has been taught in schools as an example of leadership, about its use of problem solving, about the role of self-creation, as a political book, and even as religious fiction. The book is infinitely adaptable and easy to relate to. Few would contest that it is Card's best written work today.<br /><br /> Our hero is Ender Wiggin, a boy who starts this tale at the tender age of six. The third child in his family (ala the book &quot;Among the Hidden&quot; third children are illegal in the world) his birth was approved of by the military. Ender is a genius, more intelligent than either his psychopathic elder brother Peter or his calm loving sister Valentine. When it becomes clear that Ender is capable defending himself in violent confrontations, the military recruits him. It seems the world was once nearly destroyed by creatures now referred to as &quot;buggers&quot;. Though the Earth was saved, barely, in the last invasion, they're looking for a military genius to beat the buggers a second time. That's where Ender comes in. He is seen as the world's last hope. If he can rise to be the commander that leads Earth's ships to military success against the bugger scourge he will have saved humanity itself. That is, if he can survive the military itself.<br /><br /> A great writer (it may have been Anne Lamott) once said that a good writer should never be afraid to put his/her characters into painful situations. Well, I can clearly state here and now that Card is in no way afraid to put Ender through the paces. This kid suffers often and regularly and if you're not comfortable reading about a miserable little child then you may as well put this book down right now. There's a real bent of cruelty to this story, some of it violent for the sake of violence and some of it done with the intention of making Ender stronger. Card's at work on this story in a variety of interesting ways. Not only does he make you think of the role of war for humanity (I found myself wondering if humans fight with one another just to keep their brains amused) but also the nature of propaganda, the toll of genius, the price of significantly affecting a child physically and emotionally even if that child is brilliant, etc. You can come at this book from a million different angles and interpretation and, even if you dislike it, you can't stop talking about it.<br /><br /> Now the book does suffer here and there from what I like to call sci-fi sexism. The explanation about why genius girls aren't entered into the school much says, &quot;They don't often pass the tests to get in. Too many centuries of evolution are working against them&quot;. Better still, the one girl that Ender does meet at the school is the first to freak out when, towards the end, he uses her in a complicated bugger game. So there you have it. A woman's instincts to stay at home and raise children make her evolutionarily less likely to want to hunt and gather and fight like her male counterparts. Due to the fact that this book was published in 1977 originally as a short story I might have forgiven this flub. The fact that Card kept it for the 1991 revision... less forgivable.<br /><br /> Now, if you're going to purchase a particular edition of &quot;Ender's Game&quot;, I'd like to personally recommend the Author's Definitive Edition. Not only has Card written a delightful and though provoking introduction to his tale but he has also gone back and fixed, &quot;the errors and internal contradictions and stylisticexcesses&quot; that have bugged him for years. The introduction puts the book into perspective, recalling not only the process by which Card as an author came to his story, but also the responses he's received to it over the years. For anyone who enjoys the book, this introduction is necessary for a really thorough reading. Also, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this to kids. Teens yes, kids no.<br /><br /> Though not without its flaws, it's unlikely that you'll ever find a science fiction book that has touched so many people in so many different and various ways. It is an excellent view of games and (in some ways) the role of videos games on children. Or maybe it's a book about childhood itself. I can't begin to try to pick apart the different things the author is trying to say here. All I can do is say that it's a great tale with a great story to tell.

In this particular case, I'm referring to the enigmatic &quot;Edge Chronicle&quot; series written by Paul Stewart and illustrated by Chris Riddell. At first glance, the books don't immediately catch your eye. They've been produced as small hardbacks in the style of &quot;The Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; and &quot;The Spiderwick Chronicles&quot;. Even the illustrations bear more than a passing resemblance to the two series, but a quick glance at the copyright page shows that these books were originally produced in England beginning in 1998. Then you begin to read and it quickly becomes clear that even though the basic plot has been done a million times before, there is something particularly original about this little series. Original and amazingly fast paced.<br /><br /> Meet Twig. The child of woodtrolls (though he looks nothing like them) and an outcast since his birth. One day Twig is being told the story of his name when his mother confesses that, in truth, he is not her son after all. Worse still, Twig was recently spotted by the mysterious Sky Pirates and there is a great deal of fear on his parents' part that he will somehow be spirited away to travel with those elusive folk. So off Twig is sent to live with his uncle. While walking through the Deepwoods (a horribly mysterious and dangerous bit of forest) Twig strays from the path in typical fairy tale fashion. Quickly he is enmeshed in a series of adventures and narrow escapes as he searches both for a way out of the forest and a discovery of who he himself is.<br /><br /> The plot starts out at a leisurely stroll but once the momentum gets going this book is a fast paced adventure-a-minute sprawl. Twig is probably nearly killed roughly fifteen times, sometimes getting out of his problems with skill, sometimes with help, and mostly by sheer dumb luck. All the classic elements of a tale are featured here too. There's the wise old man (who appears only as a memory here but will undoubtedly feature more heavily in the future stories in the series). There's a big hairy threatening creature that turns out to be friendly (and meets a somewhat unexpected fate). There's the hero who searches to find out more of his past and there's a villain who wishes to do the unspeakable. All in all, the book doesn't sound too thrilling with such a description. But let me tell you, the imagination that went into this story is incredible. Some people might compare this to &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Well, perhaps, but did Bilbo Baggins ever face a creature that could blow you up like a balloon with its venom? How about a race of creatures that gorge on the honey of vast translucent aphids all day? Worse still there's a creature that traps its victims in a hard egg like structure so as to drink of the remains when they've died, a tree that feasts on flesh, a race of underground dwellers that drink the sap of this tree and become massive violent bald warriors, and furry tribble-like creatures that act like nothing more than carnivorous &quot;Gappers of Frip&quot; (a good book).<br /><br /> The amount of thought and energy that went into this story is incredible. Now, I'll just state here and now that this book is probably intended for the older child reader. There are some gory goings-on in this here tale. Lots of big ugly teeth and a lovable creature that meets its death. At the same time, there's no getting over the fact that this story, while good, probably would have been merely okay if it hadn't been accompanied by Chris Riddell's AMAZING illustrations. All you have to do to appreciate them is to look at the map of The Edge that appears in the front of this book. There you see a complex little world filled with the tiniest pen strokes imaginable. The level of detail found in these pictures is breathtaking. They're similar to the work of fellow illustrator Peter Sis but the characters are a little more realistic. Of course, there is a downside to having such amazing images to look at. While the views of our hero and his world are breathtaking, the evil creatures found herein are incredibly disgusting, scary, and/or horrific. I've never seen teeth used in such horrible ways. My assumption is that the author and the illustrator worked closely together to create such amazing critters and images.<br /><br /> As I've admitted before, the basic outlines of this tale are things that you've seen before. Yes. No question there. But I can guarantee you right here and now that it's unlike that you've read anything half as original and fast paced as this particular tale within the last month. You're going to get a few grumbling hardcore fantasy lovers that nitpick over a detail here or a swatch of dialog there, but this is a great start to an interesting series. Definitely consider giving it a shot.ow illustrator Peter Sis but the characters are a little more realistic. Of course, there is a downside to having such amazing images to look at.

I often find that I love so many of them that to buy them all I'd have to be either rich or a particularly good shoplifter. Yet when Terry Pratchett's, &quot;The Wee Free Men&quot; came out I found myself actually buying it, it was so good. Not wanting to make a habit out of this sort of thing I decided that the next time I came across a great book I'd just read it in the bookstore. The next thing I knew &quot;A Hat Full of Sky&quot;, the sequel to &quot;The Wee Free Men&quot; had was published and I began reading it. It was only after I publicly embarrassed myself by laughing uproariously in front of the other shoppers in the store that I had to face facts. I was going to buy &quot;A Hat Full of Sky&quot; too. I did, I read it through, and I loved it. Though maybe not as moving as its predecessor, &quot;A Hat Full of Sky&quot; truly deserves to be read by anyone who thinks that fantasy and humor should become synonymous.<br /><br /> As we remember from &quot;The Wee Free Men&quot;, Tiffany Aching has recently done battle with the Queen of Fairies, armed with only a frying pan and the help of some violent pictsies. The Wee Free Men, as they call themselves, have decided to keep Tiffany safe by keeping a close eye on her at all times. It turns out this eye might not be close enough though when Tiffany becomes the object of a hiver's desires. Hivers are creatures that move from powerful creature to powerful creature, taking over their minds until there's nothing left in the body but a shell. When Tiffany, witch in training, finds herself a victim of a hiver (a creature no one has ever killed before) it's with the help of her bright blue friends that she is able to face it down.<br /><br /> Now, the first half of this book is everything you could hope for in a story. The Wee Free Men decide that the best way to rush to Tiffany's aid is to make themselves appear as human. Therefore, they fill up some old clothes and attempt to work together to walk as a single being. Needless to say, this is not without its failings. While the Wee Free Men are riding in a carriage towards Tiffany the other passengers in the stagecoach view the &quot;man&quot; with fear (especially when the buttons on his trousers pop open and a small redheaded man sticks his head out to talk to them). About this point I was gasping for breath, trying not to draw too much attention to myself as I laughed at the book. Sometimes I think that Pratchett's the funniest fantasy writer living today.<br /><br /> Unfortunately, somewhere around page 185 the book slows down. Less attention is paid to the Wee Free Men and far more to Tiffany and Mistress (now called Granny) Weatherwax. This is all well and good, but part of what I liked about &quot;The Wee Free Men&quot; was the fact that its little blue characters (I've heard them referred to as drunken tattooed Smurfs) appear regularly from the beginning of the story to the end. Here, they kind of drift off and the book forgets about them. Worse still, there are about five different endings to this story. You think it's over.... And then here's another ending right around the corner... Before you meet yet ANOTHER ending five pages later. The action doesn't rise and fall towards the end, it falls and falls. And falls some more.<br /><br /> None of this is to say that the book is bad. I'm still happy that I purchased it. I just don't think it's quite as good as the original. Let's hope that with the future books in this series that equal attention is paid to Tiffany as there is to her little blue drunkards. If not, I can only quote the response the Wee Free Men themselves might have.<br /><br /> &quot;Oh waily waily waily&quot;.re, they fill up some old clothes and attempt to work together to walk as a single being.

Nor does it strike you as American. What &quot;The Shape Game&quot; offers the average reader is a family that is trying to connect with art any way it can. The story is an autobiographical piece about how a single trip to the Tate Museum with his family changed the artist's way of looking at art forever. The players in this mini-drama include the author/illustrator as a child, his brother George, his Dad, and his Mom (not Mum?). One day the mother drags the family to the museum despite their mumblings and grumblings. We see a shot of them walking, all grays and browns, next to the river. Inside, the family starts to offer comments on what they see. In what may well be my favorite line in a picture book published in the last five years, the father asks what a particular sculpture is:<br /><br /> &quot;It's supposed to be a mother and child&quot;, said Mom.<br /><br /> &quot;Well, why isn't it?&quot; said Dad.<br /><br /> He has a point. As they continue, however, they start to identify with what they're seeing. There's a section explaining the Augustus Egg painting, &quot;Past and Present No. 1&quot; that is nothing short of phenomenal. I only wish Browne had taken the time to give this sort of attention to more paintings found throughout the Tate. The kids start imagining their dad in some of the pictures (he fits in remarkably well in a lot of them) and by the end everyone has had a good time. The shot of them walking home is infused with all sorts of colors. On the ride home, Anthony's mom shows him the Shape Game. All you have to do is to draw a shape. Any shape at all. Then you pass this shape to another person and they have to change it into something that makes sense. Browne concludes, &quot;And, in a way, I've been playing the shape game ever since...&quot;<br /><br /> After completing this story in my own time, I was struck by the thought that this book is an excellent companion piece to the rather similar picture book, &quot;Uncle Andy's&quot;. In both stories, the author/illustrators reflect on why they decided to create art in the first place. For James Warhola the decision came from hanging out with his cool Uncle Andy (Warhol). In this book, the artist began drawing after seeing the range of artistic possibilities at the Tate. I wish I could say that the book is flawless, but a couple things bugged me here and there. For one thing, I don't know when Anthony Browne was born but the fashions and haircuts presented in this story look oddly contemporary to me. Also, the style of drawing changes violently at times. Sometimes he'll make his characters beautifully lifelike and realistic. The next thing you know they're cartoonish and off-putting (especially the section where the father imagines himself chased by a lion). Still, Browne has a wonderful way of matching his characters' movements to the movements found in the pictures behind them. I also was very taken with the fact that the portraits featured in this story are relatively unknown to the vast majority of child readers. You'll find works here from such artists as Peter Blake, George Stubbs, and John Martin. Not necessarily household names, you know. It's also a lot of fun to notice how shapes from the Shape Game pop up in the occasional portrait or background image without announcing themselves unduly.<br /><br /> My only final critique is this: The father is notorious in this story for telling awful awful jokes. Yet at one point he tells my FAVORITE joke of all time. I suggest you get out this book and flip to the joke told in a makeshift rendition of Sir John Everett Milais's, &quot;The Boyhood of Raleigh&quot;. Right there you will find (if told correctly) the best joke in the whole wide world. For an introduction to art and how average people can eventually identify with it, this is an ideal creation. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to fill their children's heads with the limitless possibilities of artist expression. Ha ha!heads with the limitless possibilities of artist expression. Ha ha! <br />	2004-07-21

I dare you to adapt a story from Edward Spencer's, 'The Fairy Queen' AND to do it in such a way that it remains true to the essential story&quot;. And before you know it some poor sap has just devoted numerous wasted hours to adapting a piece of literature that was never meant to be dumbed down in any form or method. So thought I as I picked up and perused the Caldecott award winning picture book, &quot;Saint George and the Dragon&quot;. I might well have abandoned it right there and then if I hadn't noticed that the illustrations (I should say the glorious illustrations) were created by the accomplished Trina Schart Hyman. I've always felt Ms. Hyman never got the respect she fully deserved, so out of respect for her I picked up this pint sized novella and read it through. Once I arrived at the last page a single thought paraded through my glory. &quot;Glory be&quot;, thought I. &quot;It worked&quot;.<br /><br /> If you're not familiar with the tale of the Red Cross Knight and his fair lady Una I'll give you a little update. In this story, Una is the princess of a realm that has been threatened by a dragon. Because her parents are wussies Una takes it upon herself to find a champion who will do battle with the fowl beast. Such a champion she finds in the Red Cross Knight and the two travel back to her land accompanied by her white donkey, pet goat, and dwarf servant (as per usual). In time, they find the dragon and three times does the Red Cross Knight fight with it. The first time he collapses from battle and is restored by a magic pool. The second time he collapses and is restored by a magic apple tree (don't ask). The third time he mightily smites the evil creature and his hand is promised in marriage to Una. But the knight is sworn to the Faerie Queen and he must serve her further before he settles down with his lovely wife.<br /><br /> If you've read &quot;The Faerie Queen&quot; then you can tell that there's been some serious editing done to this telling. In some ways the Una of the original tale is far more gutsy and virtuous than her watered down compatriot in picture book form. Just the same, there's no getting around the fact that this story would never have even taken place if Una had capitulated to her parents' fears and not sought help. Author Margaret Hodges is clever enough to insert the occasional phrase from the original text when appropriate. These are usually fairly easy to read, though kids might stumble over a word or two. And there's no getting around the fact that this puppy is wordy. Still, considering how much was in the original text...<br /><br /> Let's face facts here and now though. Would this book be anywhere without the fine lines and exemplary technique of Ms. Hyman? Interestingly enough, I was mightily disappointed in Hyman's dragon. She excels at human and fairy faces in this book, but the dragon featured isn't frightening enough. His clawed hands are thick and clumsy and his fire breathing is paltry at best. Still, everything else here is superb. For example, Hyman is so careful about getting even the smallest details right that the borders of her pictures are filled with plants, flowers, and berries that are native to the British Isles. There too, she has created a kind border technique where characters can peer intently at the reader from time to time. I think one of the things I like best about her illustrations is the way Ms. Hyman breaks through the fourth wall. At significant moments characters in her books will regard the reader with blatant stares, as if they're daring you to challenge their importance in the tale. The result is always shocking, never predictable. Frankly, this book may lack in the whole big-green-scaly-monster department, but it excels everywhere else.<br /><br /> If you're interested in getting the kids involved in Spencer from an early age onward, you could do worse than pick, &quot;Saint George and the Dragon&quot;. Big fights, big words, and epic plotting... what more could a kid hope for? I'm not going to pretend that some kids won't be bored to death by this book because some most definitely will. But there's always that odd child here and there that will take this book to heart and carry it with him or her for the rest of their days. For them was this book written.encer from an early age onward, you could do worse than pick, &quot;Saint George and the Dragon&quot;.

What is it about this cute little story told through poems about a boy coming to terms with poetry and his dead dog that so many people adore? Is it the touching tale of a kid who misses his pet? Is it the first page, which sports the phrase, &quot;I don't want to because boys don't write poetry. Girls do&quot;? Or is it the fact that the book is approximately 86 pages in length (not including the eight short poems in the back) and can be read in approximately twenty minutes? I suspect the last. After all, this book is on many a summer reading list. Kids aren't fools and they'll grab the nearest shortest book that they can (if they get a chance). The lucky thing is, the book's pretty okay.<br /><br /> I've already quoted to you the first line in the story. From what the reader can gather, a teacher by the name of Mrs. Stretchberry has told her class that they are required to write one poem a day and hand it in to her. Jack, our protagonist in this tale, is not pleased. He doesn't want to write poetry and he doesn't much care for some of the poems Mrs. Stretchberry reads. His response to Robert Frost's, &quot;Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening&quot; is a concise, &quot;Why doesn't the person just keep going if he's got so many miles to go before he sleeps?&quot; Good question. But as the class progresses and Jack begins to understand more and more about what makes a poem good (he has some insightful comments on that topic). He begins to write poems in earnest and he becomes fascinated with the author/poet Walter Dean Myers. Suddenly Jack is desirous of nothing but getting Mr. Myers into his school to speak. To his delight, the man agrees and Jack is in heaven. Throughout this story he has also been slowly writing about his yellow dog Sky who was hit by a car. The final poem by Jack is a kind of ode to his dear departed pet, at last coming to terms with Sky's death.<br /><br /> This is an excellent way of introducing kids to poetry. I liked that Jack assumed most of poetry consisted of how one breaks up sentences. He suspects at one point that perhaps poets like Robert Frost just wrote out their poems and then someone (possibly their teachers) broke them up and posted them for everyone to see (just as Mrs. Stretchberry does). The book works hard to make it clear that poetry is not restricted to women, either as readers or as writers. The arrival of Walter Dean Myers makes this very clear as well. I was admittedly a little shocked that author Sharon Creech chose that particular poet as her visiting maestro. I mean, I like Myers, don't get me wrong. I've admittedly only ever read his young adult books (&quot;Monster&quot; and such) and they were fine, but this book doesn't just put him on a pedestal. It flatters, praises, lauds, and sings the praises of him. He becomes the ultimate poet extraordinaire, as funny as he is nice. Which is great I guess... but why Walter Dean Myers specifically? The world may never know.<br /><br /> If I could change anything about this book, I guess I'd make it clear from the start that the poems that Jack comments on throughout the story appears in the back of the text. As it is, the reader only happens upon them accidentally by the tale's end. &quot;Love That Dog&quot; isn't as strong as Creech's, &quot;Walk Two Moons&quot;, but to be fair, it's written for an entirely different audience. Forget reluctant readers. This book is written for reluctant poets. Those kids that will pick it up hoping to read through something easy may find themselves enticed to write their own poetry after a couple pages. I know I was, and I'm 26.

Author/illustrator Jules Feiffer is nothing if not an expert on the focused yet misleadingly simple picture book. Accompanying such a text with matching focused yet misleadingly simple illustrations, &quot;Bark, George&quot; is just one of those books that kids love in a twisted kind of way. Similar to the works of Shel Silverstein, the story follows one pup's crazy way of expressing himself.<br /><br /> George's mother is patient, but only up to a point. She is attempting to get George, her puppy, to speak. But the first time she asks him he replies, &quot;Meow&quot;. The second time he does a quick &quot;Quack-quack&quot; and the third time it's a simple &quot;Oink&quot;. By the time George gets to &quot;Moo&quot;, his mother has had it. She takes him immediately to the doctor and when George says, &quot;Meow&quot;, the doctor reaches into George's mouth and pulls out a cat. Next, he takes out a duck, followed by a pig, and finally (the doctor needs his longest latex glove for this one) a gigantic cow. To the joy of all, George immediately says &quot;Arf&quot; when asked to speak (though how the doctor knew not to pull out another dog from George's mouth we'll never know). Thrilled to death, his mother kisses everyone and takes George out into the street to show him off. The place is full of people, and George's mom instructs, &quot;Bark, George&quot;. The final picture is of a small George saying, politely, &quot;Hello&quot;.<br /><br /> Now the correct reading of this book to young 'uns depends on a lot of things. First of all, you need to be able to do each voice George produces appropriately. Next, you need to be able to play up the surprise ending in a successful way. What I love about this book is that most kids will get the gag at the end. They'll realize what it means when George says, &quot;Hello&quot;. In a way, this book teaches kids how to get jokes. Priceless information too rarely given! Finally, this book is not for squeamish adults. I can see plenty of grown-ups freakin' out over the ramifications of George's internal contents. They'll see this story as a tale of a ravenous dog that will eat anything from pigs to people. Sensible readers won't see it that way, but I have to tell you to watch out for those parents that would protect their children against potentially hungry pups (I should point out that it's never clear in the story HOW George acquires all those animals down his throat).<br /><br /> It's good to have a sturdy collection of reliable read-aloud picture books to reference when you need them. Definitely consider adding &quot;Bark, George&quot; to such recent classics as &quot;Duck on a Bike&quot; and &quot;Click, Clack, Moo&quot; for your preschool speaking engagements.

Books	4	3	3	N	N	A sleeper hit	After reading, &quot;Where's Pup?&quot; a single question burned itself into my brain and sat there bubbling for hours afterwards. Mainly: Is that Woody Allen wandering around this picture book? And the answer, as far as I can ascertain, is yes. Yes, that is Woody Allen scouring a circus in clown clothes for his little dog. And yes, he finds the pup in the end.<br /><br /> Our intrepid hero has lost his dog (as should be well indicated by the title of this piece). Determined to find his pup he confronts various members of the circus entourage. Each person or persons answers in a lovely sing-songy rhyme, usually indicating that the Woody Allen looking clown should try someone else. For example, when he confronts a magician and his lovely lady in a box (artfully cut apart), the lady replies, &quot;Don't know. Go ask Jo. She's feeding Mo&quot;. When he later confronts a man about to blow a pig out of a cannon he's told, &quot;No clue. Go ask Sue. She's riding Blue&quot;. You get the idea. By the end, the poor clown is stumped. That is, until he looks at the top of a bodybuilder pyramid. Now, the edition of this book that I read came from the library. This final picture folds out and at its very top is, I can only assume, pup on a chair. Unfortunately, multiple readings by smallish children rendered this final panel nonexistent (it got ripped off somewhere along the way). So watch out. This book appears to be easily torn by eager little hands. In a final shot the clown joins his pup (I was a little disappointed that it wasn't dressed like Annie Hall) on the chair and the two hug. A sweet ending.<br /><br /> The text of this story is well done. None of the rhymes ever feel strained or forced. They flow trippingly off the tongue and lead the reader from one circus performer to another with the greatest of ease. Even kids unfamiliar with circuses and circus life will understand and appreciate the clown's search for a beloved pet. Now if there was only something we could do about his love life...e life...	2004-07-20

Certainly he'd been churning out stories that spoke to kids and their qualms (&quot;Owen&quot;, &quot;Chrysanthemum&quot;, etc.) Lilly grabbed the world's spotlight and focused it squarely on her cute little shoulders. Though she'd already appeared in two previous Henkesian creations (&quot;Chester's Way&quot; and &quot;Julius, the Baby of the World&quot;), this was Lilly's first foray as a protagonist with her name in the title. As such, the book has been turned into a stage play, been read by millions of small children, and gives spunky kids someone they can identify with and look up to. In short, she's a pip.<br /><br />Lilly is mightily pleased with her life at the moment. She loves school and she adores her teacher Mr. Slinger. Mr. Slinger (undoubtedly a relation of Miss Twinkle from &quot;Chrysanthemum&quot;) is the coolest prof in the world. He wears crazy colored ties, refers to his students as &quot;rodents&quot;, provides yummy tasty snacks, and has a penchant for patterned shirts. Lilly is determined to someday be a teacher all thanks to Mr. Slinger. Unfortunately, Lilly's Slinger-love takes a downturn when she brings her new purple plastic purse to class. Noisily displaying it at an inappropriate time, Slinger confiscates the item until the end of the day. In anger, Lilly draws a mean portrait of her teacher and hides it in his book bag. But when the young girl opens her returned purse outside of school, she finds a note reading, &quot;Today was a difficult day. Tomorrow will be better&quot;, and some yummy snacks are included. Suddenly wracked with guilt, Lilly decides to make up with her teacher and by the end the two have reconciled joyfully.<br /><br />Now I was lucky enough to see the Minneapolis Children Theater's production of this particular book (combined with some of Lilly's other adventures to pad it out). And though I'm not a weepy gal by nature, I found myself tearing up during the reading of Mr. Slinger's note to Lilly (i.e. &quot;Tomorrow will be better&quot;) as well as when I read the picture book. I don't tear up during children's stage productions and I CERTAINLY don't tear up when reading picture books. Yet here I was, all of 26 years of age, and bawling over the succinct sweetness of Slinger's comforting note. How many books have done this for you recently? How many picture books?<br /><br />The tale is filled to the brim with the Henkes touches a person expects from his work (be sure to notice the Krazy Kat reference in Lilly's dining room). As per usual there is the comfortable family containing loving parents. And best of all, that wonderful way Henkes has of bringing a happy child to life on the page. No adult reading this book would want to be anyone BUT Mr. Slinger and no child reading it wouldn't want to know him. As for Lilly, she walks the fine line between precocious and precious. And wins. If you're a Henkes fan you won't want to miss this delightful star-making turn.

I've read some pretty fabulous books illustrated by Helen Oxenbury in my day. She's one of those rare artists that pay close attention to fine incomparable details. As for author Phyllis Root, I'd not had the pleasure of reading one her tales until I picked up &quot;Big Momma Makes the World&quot;. Now I read reviews and descriptions of this book long before I saw it myself. These reviews would summarize the plot and even lift enjoyable passages from the text. I liked what I read and I liked that the reviewers liked what they read. It was with the greatest shock imaginable that I finally located this book and found, to my amazement, that Big Momma was a big white chick. Hunhuna? Now you might think it a bit prejudiced of me to have leapt to the conclusion that Big Momma, the godlike figure in this tale, was black but that's exactly what I did.<br /><br />This story is a creation tale in its own right. In it, we follow Big Momma and her little baby as she creates a whole new world. She starts just like you'd expect a godlike figure to start. First there's water, then light, then dark. She makes the sun and the moon, &quot;just in time for the little baby's nap&quot;, and then makes the earth itself. Then it's time to make fish and birds and (because the laundry started piling up) the rest of the animals are made with one Big Bang. Still, Big Momma is lonely and she has no one to talk to on her front porch at night. So out of the leftover mud comes a swarm of naked people (done in a tasteful style that is more than a little reminiscent of the late lamented Walt Kelly). In time, she takes her baby up with her into the sky and tells everyone in the world to behave because, &quot;I'll be keeping an eye on you&quot;. And from time to time she still does. She and that little baby of hers.<br /><br />Now Phyllis Root notes in her blurb that this story came out of a family car trip where she would tell Big Momma tales to entertain her kids. The story in and of itself has a swell feel to it. A kind of easy going vernacular that reminded me (in a way) of &quot;Swamp Angel&quot; by Anne Isaacs. The fact that the character is white confused me originally but I recovered. I suppose God could be a white woman too. Why not? But though I think Oxenbury threw everything she had into this tale, the pictures didn't spellbind me like her other books did. The baby in the story looked as if it had crawled straight out of her, &quot;We're Going on a Bear Hunt&quot;. And though the animals are cute, they're nothing compared to her illustrations for the brilliant, &quot;Farmer Duck&quot; (written by M. Waddell). Though she's tossed every trick she has into its creation (the colors in this story are alone worth the price of admission) I had the nagging feeling that something was missing. I dunno.<br /><br />I can see people becoming violent over this tale for a variety of different reasons. Some people are going to fall head-over-heels in love with it. They'll rejoice in the illustrations, the excellent text, and the progressive idea of a single mom creating the world (a thought I rather like too). Other people will recoil at the idea of God being reduced (in their eyes) to something so new and different. I personally had my expectations raised a little too high by Oxenbury's other books, so my own view of the story is slightly tainted. Nonetheless, this is an excellent book to read to little ones that need a benevolent creator in their lives. A highly entertaining and interesting lark.feel to it.

583896:US	49148452	R2P3UM78JSESH8	037571457X	373105656	Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood (Pantheon Graphic Novels)	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Quite possibly the best book of the year	&quot;Persepolis&quot; marks the third book in the almighty triumvirate of great autobiographical graphic novels that examine injustice. Joining the ranks of &quot;Maus&quot; by Art Spiegelman and &quot;Palestine&quot; by Joe Sacco, &quot;Persepolis&quot; has garnered a remarkable amount of attention. Positive attention, that is. Suddenly it's getting high marks in everything from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; to &quot;VOYA: Voice of Youth Advocates&quot;. I wonder to myself whether or not author/artist Marjane Satrapi has been surprised by the mounds of attention. I also wonder how it is that she was able to take her own life story and weave it seamlessly with the history of her own country, Iran. This book is like an illustrated version of &quot;Midnight's Children&quot;, but far darker and far more real.<br /><br />The first image in &quot;Persepolis&quot; is the same image you see on its cover. Marjane sits wearing a veil in 1980 for the first time. As the story continues, Marjane explains her own beginnings as well as the beginning of the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;. In her own life, Marjane was an only child of middle class intellectual parents. She experienced the usual childhood ups and downs. Sometimes she believed she was God's next chosen prophet. Other times she wanted to demonstrate with her parents in the street against the Shah. Over the course of her childhood Marjane learns more about the limits of class in Iran as well as the secrets behind her family history. She finds that her grandfather was a prince, her uncle a political prisoner for years, and her parents far braver than she ever expected. Marjane deals with the danger of challenging authority under the rule of religious extremists while growing up as a normal girl. By the end, her parents determine that the only thing left to do is to send their only daughter to Vienna and Marjane must face a future without them by her side.<br /><br />Before I read the book I scanned the illustrations and found them lacking. I thought (originally) that they were too simplistic to effectively convey a deep plot and deeper discussion of the human propensity for violence (and good). After reading the first page I discovered that this assumption, while normally correct, was wrongdy wrong wrong wrong. Yes, it's certainly true that Satrapi's style is simple. At the same time, it's also the ideal companion to the piece. In a book such as this you do not want to draw attention away from the narrative voice with inappropriately overdone illustrations. As for the writing itself, it's engaging to even the most reluctant reader. And what better way to teach people a little Iranian history? Quite frankly, I was baffled by some of the things I discovered here. I consider myself a lightly educated middle class individual. I know a little more world history than joe schmoe down the street, but not much more. Nonetheless, after reading roughly five pages of &quot;Persepolis&quot; I discovered, to my chagrin, that I know jack squat about Iran. Were you aware that Iranians are not, in fact, Arabs? How about the roots of the Cultural Revolution? How much do you know about that? Or the day to day routines of people living in Iran in the 1980s? No?<br /><br />Today we the American people live in a country where our rulers like to bandy about phrases like, &quot;Axis of Evil&quot;, and condemn entire countries with a single blow. What &quot;Persepolis&quot; does so (apparently) effortlessly is to put a human face on inhuman suffering. Iranians have been through more horrors than can be recounted in a single book. I think what struck me the hardest about this story was the little things. The stories about girls in school skipping class to flirt with boys. Discussions with other kids about farting from kidney beans. Punk rock and Michael Jackson. All this took the book from being a personal voice of a nation's struggle to the point where your average reader identified deeply with the characters. The final image in this book is heart breaking. I only hope I have the guts to get &quot;Persepolis 2&quot; and read it cover to cover.. The final image in this book is heart breaking.

Nothing like hearing about society as we know it disintegrating into a pile of gibbering goo. Some of these futuristic stories say the end will come with disease. Others say it'll be an enormous war. But far more chilling (perhaps because it's the most realistic of the scenarios) is John Rowe Townsend's deadly, &quot;Noah's Castle&quot;. Carefully extending his tale to show the disintegration of a family alongside that of society at large, Townsend's book focuses on one man and his struggle to protect his unwilling kin.<br /><br />Barry Mortimer doesn't know what to think when his father purchases an enormous house for himself and his family members. As the patriarch of a family of six, Barry's father has been acting particularly strangely as of late. After moving into their new home, Barry and his sister Nessie discover that their pop has been carefully constructing shelves in the basement. After seeing this odd arrangement, Mr. Mortimer explains his reasoning. The economic situation of the world at large has grown significantly unstable as of late. After judging there to be rough times ahead, Mr. Mortimer has taken the precaution of hoarding copious amounts of food and bartering items for the months ahead. As predicted, this turns out to be not a minute too soon. Food prices begin to soar and people grow hungrier and more desperate as the days trickle on. As Barry watches the misery around him (both within the family unit and in the world at large) he must wrestle with his inclinations to betray his father. Should he turn over their food to those that would give it freely to the poor? Or should he obey his dad, thereby keeping the family well prepared for the future?<br /><br />What the book really boils down to is an examination of how a family's quality of life can disintegrate even if they have their basic necessities. Though Mr. Mortimer is adept at keeping the family well fed and clothed, he is utterly incapable at maintaining their state of mind. As these members begin to disappear from the home, Mr. Mortimer's bafflement is clear. I've rarely read a young adult novel that so clearly examined a domineering father with so much care. The dad in this book is written in such a way that you completely understand Barry's simultaneous disgust, pity, and pride in the man's dealings. I loved how a final glimpse of Mr. Mortimer's past gave such a clear insight into his driving principles. Though he may be old fashioned, a bully, cruel to his wife, a sexist chauvinist pig, and incapable of basic affections, he's still a man that cares deeply for his family members.<br /><br />I was also impressed by how riveting I found the tension in this tale. As Barry's guilt and wariness increase, so too did my own guilt and wariness. I guess the best way to describe this book is to say that the reader is perfectly in synch with the narrator. How often do you find that to be the case in the books you read? Honestly, I think it's an often sought after and rarely realized goal on the part of writers everywhere. But Barry's the ultimate everyman. You can't find a flaw in his thought process that you wouldn't find in your own were you in the same situations as he.<br /><br />&quot;Noah's Castle&quot; is one of the best written young adult novels I've ever had the pleasure to read. Engrossing to the point where you begin to wonder about the nature of human civility itself, the story is both believable and a great tale. This book is written expertly. If you want to read something that asks not only &quot;what if&quot; but also &quot;how could&quot;, you couldn't do any better than this.

The dad in this book is written in such a way that you completely understand Barry's simultaneous disgust, pity, and pride in the man's dealings. I loved how a final glimpse of Mr. Mortimer's past gave such a clear insight into his driving principles. Though he may be old fashioned, a bully, cruel to his wife, a sexist chauvinist pig, and incapable of basic affections, he's still a man that cares deeply for his family members. <br> <br>I was also impressed by how riveting I found the tension in this tale. As Barry's guilt and wariness increase, so too did my own guilt and wariness. I guess the best way to describe this book is to say that the reader is perfectly in synch with the narrator. How often do you find that to be the case in the books you read? Honestly, I think it's an often sought after and rarely realized goal on the part of writers everywhere. But Barry's the ultimate everyman. You can't find a flaw in his thought process that you wouldn't find in your own were you in the same situations as he.<br> <br>&quot;Noah's Castle&quot; is one of the best written young adult novels I've ever had the pleasure to read. Engrossing to the point where you begin to wonder about the nature of human civility itself, the story is both believable and a great tale. This book is written expertly. If you want to read something that asks not only &quot;what if&quot; but also &quot;how could&quot;, you couldn't do any better than this. A truly wonderful forgotten classic.	2004-07-16

The winner of at least three, count 'em, three Caldecott awards, Ms. Brown began her career with lovely but simple picture books. As her work progressed and her talents extended, she moved outside of her comfort zone and began to take bigger and better risks. As a result, &quot;Shadow&quot; was published in 1982, won the 1983 Caldecott, and remains her best work today. A translation of a French poem by the author Blaise Cendrars, the book is a stunning amalgamation of lyrical text, fabulous illustrations, and jaw dropping metaphors.<br /><br />Before I describe the book, I want to make something clear. This book is meant to entrance. If you have a child that is comfortable reading (or being read) a story about shadows and our own shadowy natures, this is an ideal tale. If, however, you have a literal minded child that doesn't particularly take to stories that lack plots, avoid &quot;Shadow&quot;. In this tale the very nature of our darker sides is explored. Marcia Brown, using her customary woodcut techniques, takes us to different parts of Africa. Here, we see scenes that compliment the text. The book describes Shadow with the enigmatic line, &quot;The eye has no shadow&quot;. We follow the tale through the nighttime, as Shadow slides behind storytellers and watches you as you sleep. Equally trickster and companion, Shadow is always dark but it does not kill. Blind, it cannot see but will pull the eagle and the vulture if they try to raise it. The final lines in the poem think deeply about the nature of shadows. &quot;Every breath stirs it to life. It is a game. A dance&quot;.<br /><br />Equally prone to statements like, &quot;Shadow itself has no shadow&quot; and &quot;It follows man everywhere, even to war&quot;, the book is tackling a very serious subject in a colorful picture book form. And remarkably, it works. The text is translated by Marcia Brown herself (is there anything she can't do?) and is a deep thoughtful series of images. Matching the tone are some of Brown's darkest images yet. There are some freakin' scary images here. The shot of the blind shadow kneeling and stretching its arms out towards the viewer... that's frightening stuff. There's also an image of a mask with deep jagged teeth that, though awesome in the best sense of the word, is a bit of a shock. The images of Africa featured here are done respectfully and with a great deal of talent. Who can resist the silhouetted shot of a forest against the multi-colored sky of the setting sun? In the foreground a black snake with red diamonds curls down a tree trunk. Using watercolored papers and woodblock human characters I can't even begin to describe the technical expertise that must have gone into this book's production. Needless to say, it works beautifully. You feel the grassy plains where the animals run. You can almost touch the stone mountains and rough paths that lead people to war.<br /><br />Some picture books are written solely to distract children for a few minutes time. Others hope to be taken a little more seriously and bring deep questions to mind. Then there are books like, &quot;Shadow&quot; that become art itself. The book should have won the Caldecott based on its use of color alone. It's a gorgeous undertaking that will engross and enrapture even the most tentative reader. Consider it highly recommended.anslated by Marcia Brown herself (is there anything she can't do?) and is a deep thoughtful series of images. Matching the tone are some of Brown's darkest images yet.

On a closer look, however, Antonio Skarmeta's brilliant 2000 creation does more than that. It shows how every human being, regardless of age, can fight injustice on an individual level. It displays sympathetic characters that are punished for thinking for themselves. And it is one of the first picture books I've ever read where the main character is a child that outsmarts a fascist regime.<br /><br /> Pedro lives in an unnamed South American country with his mother and father. Each day after work his parents sit on the sofa to listen to foreign radio stations about their country's military dictatorship. Pedro doesn't really understand the importance of this, preferring to play soccer with his friends. One day, while playing, he sees the father of one of his friends being led away by a group of soldiers. That night Pedro finds that his own parents, like Daniel's, are against their country's form of government. When he asks if he himself is against the dictatorship his mother replies, &quot;Children aren't against anything. Children are just children&quot;. The next day a military man enters Pedro's classroom with an assignment. They are to write a composition under the soldier's watchful eye entitled, &quot;What my family does at night&quot;. Pedro thinks it through and after talking with his friend Juan proceeds to write. In the end, the reader discovers that sometimes children are far cannier than the adults around them might suspect.<br /><br /> In many ways the real question this story raises is whether or not children have the ability to make careful informed decisions. On the outset, Pedro's mother thinks this isn't possible. She believes that kids are innocent and incapable of deep thought. When Pedro tells Juan this, his friend's response is, &quot;They all say that. They took my father away up north&quot;. So you see, when a child is affected personally by the events around him/her, that child cannot help but come to their own conclusions. What Pedro writes in the end is a clever tale of how his parents usually come home and, after dinner, play chess. The last line of the book (after Pedro has read this composition to his parents) is this:<br /><br /> &quot;Well&quot;, said his father, &quot;we'd better buy a chess set&quot;.<br /><br /> Fabulous writing. Would you expect anything less from the author that wrote the novel on which the film &quot;Il Postino&quot; was based? I loved the plot of this book and, in a way, I wished that the illustrations matched it. The pictures here are fine, of course. They accurately portray the ways in which kids feel the effects of life in a strictly controlled country. Illustrator Alfonso Ruano also isn't afraid to focus his attention on the seemingly innocuous elements of a tale. When the children are told the subject of their composition, the picture on the facing page is of an eraser that has had a small hole drilled into it. Two pages later you see Pedro grasping the edge of his desk as he attempts to try to figure out what to write. Behind him looms the soldier, arms clasped behind his back. Another artist might have chosen to make the tale a little more artistically rendered, but Ruano has done pretty well with this book. The result is that your attention is focused entirely on the story itself.<br /><br /> Tackling freedom and personal choice in a picture book is very hard work. Very hard. In the case of &quot;The Composition&quot; it's pulled off brilliantly. A creative amalgamation of text, subtext, and darn good writing this book is appropriate for any and every kid. If you'd like a book that is politically charged but subtle too, I think &quot;The Composition&quot; is a brilliant choice.affected personally by the events around him/her, that child cannot help but come to their own conclusions.

First of all, I'd like to offer my congratulations to Ms. Pierce.  After years and years of simply awful covers that publishers have slapped onto her books, she has finally been given a decent one.  I mean, have you see some of her other covers?  I'm not talking about these incredibly cool ones like the one for \\"Trickster's Choice\\".  I'm talking about the ones created for such classic tales as \\"Wild Magic\\" or \\"Alanna: The First Adventure\\".  Ms. Pierce has paid her bad-cover dues.  Now she has truly earned a couple beautiful ones.  I admit that much of my attraction to this tale was due to its alluring cover illustration.  It was just my own good luck that the story inside was wonderfully gripping and well written as well.<br /><br />This book follows Pierce's \\"Lioness Quartet\\", a series of books that centered on the lady knight Alanna.  In \\"Trickster's Choice\\", Aly (Alanna's daughter) is now the center and focus.  Aly is the daughter of a famous knight and a famous spy.  Both her parents are fighters by nature, but somehow they just can't get it through their heads that all their sixteen-year-old daughter wants to do is become spy like her dad.  When Alanna decides that her daughter has become too bull-headed about the matter, Aly takes off on a small adventure of her own.  She gets more than she bargained for, however, when her boat is captured by pirates and she is sold as a slave to a foreign noble family.  The fact that she has winded up with this particular group of nobles is no accident, however.  The trickster god Kyprioth is determined to use Aly's spy skills to protect the family's children, whatever the cost.  Before she knows it, Aly is caught up in court intrigues and a political battle between the dark skinned raka and their white skinned luarin oppressors.<br /><br />I wanted to read my first Tamora Pierce book without having to read through all her previous novels.  So I picked up \\"Trickster's Choice\\" and hoped for the best.  As it happens, you don't necessarily need to have read its predecessors, though it certainly couldn't hurt.  Pierce is fond of explaining all past activities and events in such a way that even a person beginning with this book (like myself) catches up easily.  Admittedly, I was disappointed with her decision to continually comment on characters and events that had little to no bearing on the current plot.  Still, these moments mostly came at the beginning of the book.  If you can get through three chapters of this story you'll be successfully hooked and ready to read on.<br /><br />As for the book itself, it's excellent.  I was amazed to find it a wonderful spy novel.  Forget Modesty Blaise and Emma Peal; Aly is the best female spy I've encountered in a long time.  Pierce has a way of making her quick on her feet without rendering her perfect or flawless.  She is mature for her sixteen years but very much the teenager.  She's smart as a whip but incredibly funny and endowed with an excellent sense of humor.  Maybe it was this humor that made me greatly prefer her to her well meaning but laughless mother.  Tamora Pierce has a website dedicated to, what she calls, \\"sheroes\\".  Aly is a worthy addition to this particular feminist genre.  I even liked her choice of mate.  Rarely do I ever understand the male heartthrobs in teen girl novels.  But Aly's fella is not only adorable but danged sexy to boot.  And I loved that though Aly was a fighter, she was by no means invincible.  When Aly fights she does so to the best of her abilities.  She's Buffy without the super powers, this one.<br /><br />I was pleased to see that the sequel to this book, \\"Trickster's Queen\\", is available and promises to be just as good.  If you've any interest in reading about a gal who outwits nobles and gods and is the companion of crows, this might be just the book for you.  It's a great tale and one worth reading again and again.  If you're tired of books in which the girls gossip and giggle, cleanse your palate with alittle \\"Trickster's Choice\\".  You're hardly gonna find action, humor, and great writing as easily anywhere else.\\"Trickster's Choice\\".

Speaking with one the other day, we got to talking about children's books.  In the past this friend has brought my attention to such wonderful picture book classics as \\"The Maggie B.\\" and I was eager to ask her opinion regarding Quaker picture books.  As far as I could determine, there aren't many of them out there.  My friend quickly assured me that when she was growing up she had the luck to attend the same Meeting as the author Brinton Turkle.  Mr. Turkle would even read to the children from his \\"Obadiah\\" series.  I had to admit that I'd never read an \\"Obadiah\\" book, much less read one.  Without further ado, my friend insisted that I read one.  So I located, \\"Obadiah the Bold\\", read it through once, read it through twice, and came to a single solitary conviction.  This book is absolutely fantastic and should be better known, consarn it!<br /><br />The plot takes place in early colonial America.  Obadiah is the fourth child in a Quaker family of seven and he has recently been given a beautiful spyglass (telescope to you laymen).  During meeting Obadiah has dutifully returned the spyglass home but has come to a decision regarding his future occupation.  He would like to be a pirate.  He would be Obadiah the Bold, Terror of the Seven Seas.  This seems like a pretty good plan and his father has to admit that there has never been a piratical Starbuck in the family before.  But when Obadiah insists that his older siblings play pirate with his, he is shocked to find himself bound and gagged before being forced to walk the plank.  Somehow this aspect of the pirate life never really occurred to him before.  When he asks his father about the matter, he's told that truly few pirates were as brave as Obadiah's grandfather.  That man sailed around the Horn four times and was the captain of a fine ship.  With joy, Obadiah is able to use his spyglass once again and now he has a new future occupation in mind.  One his grandfather would have been proud of.<br /><br />I read this book through initially with a wary eye.  I know a lot of Quakers and I know a lot of Quakerly misconceptions.  There are people to this day that will get Quakers mixed up with the Amish.  I don't know how many times I've mentioned that I went to a Quaker school only to be asked, \\"Could you wear buttons?\\".  So I was naturally worried that this book might perpetuate those stereotypes.  In a way you could argue that it does.  I mean, there are a lot of \\"thee\\" and \\"thous\\" but at the same time this is obviously a historical piece.  Moreover, I kind of enjoyed that the Quaker meeting was self-explanatory.  There was no long drawn out explanation about the events.  The book also made it perfectly clear that when you get down to it, there's just not a lot of difference between boys in the 1700s and boys today.  I mean, Obadiah wants to be a pirate.  Today, one of the best selling picture books is the charming, \\"How I Became a Pirate\\" by Melinda Long.  Coincidence?  I think not!<br /><br />The book also shows an honestly loving family.  When our young hero declares his life's ambition, his family does not ridicule him or say silly things like, \\"That is not the Quaker way\\" (words that a book written by someone who was not a Quaker would have undoubtedly included).  Instead the family listens to him and respects his choices.  Later, when Obadiah decides to ask his dad about a matter that has been troubling him, his father is patient and willing to set aside his work to speak with his youngest son.  It's a touching and incredibly real moment.  As for the illustrations in this book, they're perfect.  Just perfect.  When Obadiah imagines himself as a fearsome pirate, I was delighted to see him wearing gold earrings, a pirate hat, a sash, sword... and his Quaker jacket.  Drawn with pencil and watercolor, every character in this book has a different and distinguishable face.  Everyscene is realistically rendered and fits the plot perfectly.<br /><br />Though it was originally published in 1965, \\"Obadiah the Bold\\" really deserves to be remembered today.  There are few Quaker picture books out there that give any kind of depth or humanity to their subjects.  This, however, is one of the few and I give it two enthusiastic thumbs up.  If you can find a copy, I suggest you secure it and read it to your little ones often.realistically rendered and fits the plot perfectly.  <BR> <BR>Though it was originally published in 1965, \\"Obadiah the Bold\\" really deserves to be remembered today.

Have you ever picked up a book that you really really wanted to like and found, instead, that you couldn't stomach it? Or worse, that it had some really wonderful elements but you had difficulty separating them from the book's problems? Well welcome to my reaction to &quot;Henrietta and the Golden Eggs&quot;. Winner of the 2003 Mildred Batchelder Honor for the best translation of a foreign children's book, I had placed high hopes on this puppy. And while there were great things about this creation, something got seriously lost in translation. Though it's inoffensive enough, the book just doesn't make a lot of sense.<br /><br />In this story we meet Henrietta. As one of the three thousand three hundred and thirty-three chickens kept in a seriously unsanitary chicken house, Henrietta is not yet fully grown. She hasn't started to lay eggs yet, but she knows that when she does they'll be golden. The other chickens ridicule little Henrietta, but when she successfully pecks a hole in the wall of the chicken house, all three thousand three hundred and thirty-three are quick to join her in the wild outdoors. After several such escapes (and recaptures by the farm employees) a solution is reached. The chicken house is extended to allow the birds to travel both in and out of doors. And when Henrietta finally lays her egg, it's just a plain brown one. The end.<br /><br />I've actually summarized this plot as well as I could, but I?ve taken the liberty of giving the book a little more semblence of order than it actually contains. It's perfectly possible that in the original German, this book made sense. In the English version, however, there are just some elements that don't. For example, Henrietta is constantly telling the older chickens that someday she'll prove them all wrong and be able to sing/fly/swim/lay golden eggs/etc. She never does a single one of these things and when the chickens point out at the end that she laid a brown rather than a gold egg saying, &quot;You didn't even need to bother trying&quot;, her reply is, &quot;Did you really believe that a chicken could lay golden eggs?&quot;. Huh? The whole book is like this. I didn't understand the moral and I didn't understand exactly what it was the author was getting at.<br /><br />Now for all the flaws of the narrative, the illustrations by Kathi Bhend almost make the book worth purchasing alone. Drawn in the most delicate of pen and inks, Bhend has given her chickens irony, sophistication, and wry good humor. Everything that the text lacks. When Henrietta first scratches a hole in the chicken coop wall we see a delightful shot of a frog climbing sturdy blades of grass. The pictures in the book are so detailed that you can make out every single tiny feather on the chickens as they cluck and strut. I was especially fond of the picture of Henrietta's egg. While everything else is all blacks and whites, the egg sits there glowing a soft brown color. For pure pleasure alone I just flipped through this book without reading a word and I had a marvelous time. I highly suggest you do the same.<br /><br />Maybe someday this book will be translated differently. Maybe when it is it'll make sense and people will come to enjoy it. Until that happy day arrives, however, this book is simple to describe. Plot so-so.

While there I'll be staying with another friend of mine who is currently earning her teaching license on the island of Oahu. She's a fan of children's literature and my hope was to find something that she could grab ahold of and enjoy. It seemed &quot;The Barefoot Serpent&quot; was the perfect choice so I grabbed a copy. Like all great graphic novels, this book deserves a second reading. And a third. Those who'll get the most out of this creation will be those people that are capable of a quiet think. Those who aren't capable will simply find it a wonderful read.<br /><br />The story at the heart of this book is couched between the life of the filmmaker Akira Kurosawa. Scott Morse has retold the life of the great artist in brief. Though this tale has nothing to do with &quot;The Barefoot Serpent&quot; 's main tale, it gives the reader to understand that much of this story is heavily influenced by Kurosawa's works. In the main tale itself, we meet a small girl, her mother, and her father. The girl's older brother committed suicide not too long ago and the family has taken a trip to Hawaii to ease their hearts. The wife goes for a ride across the island, meeting up with a woman running a shaved ice stand. The husband stays on the beach dealing with what he find there. The daughter follows the sounds of the Night Marchers and discovers a young boy. Most of the story follows these two characters. The boy has recently carved a mask and he decides to ask his uncle to purchase it. The girl tags along and the uncle explains to the boy that the mask speaks of sorrow. The kind of sorrow, &quot;like a snake wit no shoes on&quot;. After thinking this through the boy offers the mask to the girl and through it she comes to accept her brother's death.<br /><br />Scott Morse provides an Afterword to his book that explains the ways in which Kurosawa influenced his story. Elements from such movies as &quot;Dreams&quot; and &quot;High and Low&quot; (which I've seen) are included, as well as scenes from &quot;Yojimbo&quot; and &quot;Drunken Angel&quot; (which I haven't seen). There's little question that the reader familiar with Kurosawa?s works is going to get more out of this piece than those who have not, but fortunately the book does not hinge on having viewed Akira's films. It helps, but it's not required. This book is, in the creator's own words, a story that contains, &quot;hope at its heart&quot;. For that reason, it's successful.<br /><br />The art is great, but I'm speaking as someone who doesn?t read graphic novels all that often. I can't compare it to any other artists out there. Maybe the television show &quot;Grim and Evil&quot;, but that's a bit of a stretch. All I can say about it is that it conveys the story beautifully. I can't help but continually go back to parts of it over and over again. I don't know why, but this book speaks to me. Morse is equally adept with his dialogue. The Hawaiian Pidgin English is dead on and often lyrical.<br /><br />I keep trying to find graphic novels that will help introduce newbies to the medium. This is an excellent starter g.n. with the kind of appeal that will entrance adults and children alike. We rarely see art forms that are of equal interest to kids AND their older counterparts.

He's one of those artists that I respect but that I've never really felt an undying affection for. His books tend to speak to the African-American experience but while I've always thought his pictures were effective I never became greatly attached to his stories. Author Patricia C. McKissack, however, won my heart with the splendid and multi-layered &quot;Christmas In the Big House, Christmas in the Quarters&quot;. When combined with Mrs. McKissack, Jerry Pinkney suddenly becomes a lot more interesting. With their talents melded, the world has seen some breath-taking picture books. &quot;Goin' Someplace Special&quot; is probably the best of these. A smart book that introduces children to the notion of racism and Jim Crow laws, McKissack and Pinkney have given us a truly worthy book for our consideration.<br /><br />'Tricia Ann is all ah-flutter. Her mother is finally letting her go all the way to Someplace Special. The trip is hardly carefree, though. After getting on the bus, 'Tricia Ann is forced to sit in the colored section. Then she can't even sit on a park bench, the words, &quot;Whites Only&quot; staring her in the face. Her friend Jimmy Lee commiserates, pointing out that even though blacks can work at the nearby restaurant, they can't sit down there to have a BLT and a cup of coffee. But the worst comes when 'Tricia Lee accidentally gets swept into a grand hotel. In the midst of an autograph signing the girl is loudly condemned and shooed out because she is black. In tears she finds a friend in an elderly churchgoer and becomes determined to finish her trip. The reader finally learns at the end that Someplace Special is none other than the public library. A place where all people are welcome.<br /><br />In her Author's Note at the back, McKissack tells how the Nashville Public Library in the 1950s voted to integrate their facilities. As a girl growing up in Tennessee, McKissack based 'Tricia Ann's experiences on her own. Through this tale, the reader comes to understand just how difficult it would have been for a young black girl to travel alone in a racially segregated city. Suddenly 'Tricia Ann seems a whole lot braver, and her trip across town a whole lot bigger. The text is, almost throughout, a constant calm narrative of big and small bigotries. I found myself wishing that the section in which 'Tricia Ann finds peace in the church courtyard was a bit less hokey. It's the single flaw in an otherwise perfect jewel of a book.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, previous Pinkney books have done little for me. And yet I loved what he chose to do with this book. Throughout the tale, 'Tricia Ann wears a memorable blue dress with yellow daisies. In almost every scene, other people are drab and colorless when compared to the bright sprightly girl and her eye catching outfit. Moreover, his protagonist's body language and posture often tell half the story in and of themselves. When 'Tricia Ann is being thrown out of the hotel she clasps on wrist in another. Her expression is part shock, part amazement. The fact that anyone could be so crude and cruel as to throw a girl out merely for her skin color.... Kids reading this section will sympathize.<br /><br />This is by no means the first McKissack/Pinkney pairing (&quot;Mirandy and Brother Wind&quot; has that particular honor), but I hope it isn't the last. The book is an entirely respectful and creative way of introducing the notion of racism to small children. Kids might not immediately understand the importance of Brown vs. the Board of Education but a book like this will make that time period a little more real to them.

There are picture books out there that discuss everything from racism and social problems to death and new babies. &quot;Kisses From Rosa&quot; fills a very specific need that I think a lot of kids will understand. In this story, author Petra Mathers confronts the pain children feel when they are far away from the people they love. Basing this tale on the separation anxiety she experienced with her tuberculosis-prone mother, Mathers offers a little comfort to those readers that cannot be near their loved ones.<br /><br />Rosa is not happy. Her mother is sick with a whistling noise in her lungs and must be sent to a special hospital high up in the mountains. Rosa has been sent during this time to live with her Aunt Mookie and cousin Clara. After getting used to the changes in her life, Rosa finds that she likes her new surrounding quite a lot. There's the dog Waldi who looks like a sausage on legs. There are the Schmidts, an older couple that offer friendship to the little girl. Then there are the cows, and the mailman, and the hornets, and more. All the while she is staying with Aunt Mookie, Rosa writes letters to her mother filled with all kinds of different kisses. The days pass and soon Rosa has received word that she can go home for Christmas to see her mama. By the end she's sad that she must leave all her new friends, but the promise of seeing her mother buoys her up.<br /><br />The book gives some attention to the pain of separation small children feel, but the majority of the text concentrates on the day to day routines of living on a farm. There are blueberries to pick and apples to press. As we read, the seasons change from summer to fall to winter. If you look at the endpapers you'll see oddly faint photographs of the people this story was based on. Altogether, the book is fine. It's comforting to those kids who know they'll be seeing their absent parents (guardians, etc.) soon. It's probably less comforting to those who won't get to see them in the near future. But while the story is nice, it isn't particularly remarkable. Fabulous illustrations might have helped but the pictures presented by Petra Mathers are a bit disappointing. Though imbued with sometimes wonderful colors and details, the illustrations are oddly flat and skewed. Their perception is completely off and inconsistent. For every fabulous shot of Rosa's mom standing on a roof amidst rose colored mountains there's a picture of Rosa standing with abnormally tiny feet near a giant of an aunt. In a way, it feels as if some of these illustrations were given a lot more time than others. As if time was short and precious and some of these pictures were rushed during the process.<br /><br />Which isn't to say the book doesn't fill a significant need. It just fails to garner much attention beyond its immediate message. Though a lovely story with lovely pictures, &quot;Kisses From Rosa&quot;, will probably end as a book that is beloved of a faithful few and forgotten by the rest.

Sometimes they're fabulous (like &quot;Thimble Summer&quot; or &quot;Caddie Woodlawn&quot;), sometimes they're brilliant (like &quot;Holes&quot; or &quot;The Westing Game&quot;) and sometimes they're so offensive they make your skin crawl. Now, I'm going to admit right here and now that I'm a little torn on &quot;The Matchlock Gun&quot;. On the one hand, it's chock full of stereotypes and awful messages. The book describes Native Americans harshly and treats slave ownership as commonplace and not much in the way of a social problem. So there's that. On the other hand, this book really does make an effort to show a historical event in a fascinating and well written way. The prose is lively, the characters interesting, and the action fast-paced and gripping.<br /><br /> In this tale (based, we are told, on a true story) a Dutch/Palatine family is bidding goodbye to their father. As a member of the local militia Captain Teunis Van Alstyne is off to protect his home, land, and family from the French and the Indians. His son, Edward, is proud to see his father go, but he's disappointed that the man isn't taking the ancient Spanish matchlock gun that rests on the mantelpiece. His father assures him that the gun is too heavy and bulky and after kissing his wife goodbye he takes off. This leaves ten year old Edward with his mother and six year old sister. As news comes that the Indians might be near after all, Edward's mom Gertrude decides that the time has come to prepare for her family's safety. She puts Edward in charge of manning the matchlock gun by the window. If Gertrude sees any Indians she will yell her son's name and he will light the gun for shooting. Though she worries that her fears may be unfounded, it turns out that Gertrude was right to prepare her family from a vicious attack. In the end, Edward becomes a hero.<br /><br /> So here's where the debate comes in: Do we dislike this book because it has a negative attitude towards Native Americans? You could make the argument, I suppose, that the author of this 1942 Newbery Award winner couldn't have predicted the shifting attitudes towards Indian attacks in the future. Perhaps you could rely on the belief that nobody was treating Native Americans very well in children's books from this time period. You could say that. Then you could notice that the 1936 Newbery Award winner was none other than &quot;Caddie Woodlawn&quot;. A balanced intelligent alternative view of Native Americans and their interactions with white settlers. So no, ladies and gentlemen, the opinions of such authors as Walter D. Edmonds were not, in fact, the only ones available when it was published. Quite frankly, they were just as offensive then as they are today and they should receive no excuses.<br /><br /> Additionally, there's the whole slavery problem. No condemnation of slavery is mentioned in the book. On the one hand, this is incredibly historically correct. No one living in this area at this time would have understood much about slaves' rights. On the other hand, the book was written in 1941. So do we hate the book because it's historically accurate or could the author have found a way to present slavery without appearing to approve of it? I think so, but it's up to the readers to decide for themselves.<br /><br /> In the end, the writing is fabulous, no question. Had this book been about anything OTHER than Indians and the passing slave comment I think it might've won my heart and mind with relative ease. As it is, this book is less offensive than (oh say) James Daugherty's ludicrously racist 1941 Newbery winner, &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; and more offensive than the aforementioned &quot;Caddie Woodlawn&quot;. It's a ripping good yarn, but that can only carry the tale so far. In the end, you must decide for yourself whether or not this book is appropriate for the kiddies today. If paired with explanations of the historical events surrounding this tale (as well as adding some of your own careful discussions regarding Native Americans and their treatment by the Europeans) this could well be a useful text even today. Just make certain you know what you're getting into before you stuff it into the hand of the nearest nine year old. It's a good tale marred by its times.as adding some of your own careful discussions regarding Native Americans and their treatment by the Europeans) this could well be a useful text even today.

And though you are well aware of Ezra Jack Keats's &quot;The Snowy Day&quot;, you decide to give Lois Ehlert's book a go anyway. You're hoping you'll end up pleasantly surprised by what you may find. And you're in luck. You are.<br /><br />In this tale of wintertime bird feeding, the author first poses a hypothetical question: &quot;Do you think birds know when it's going to snow?&quot;. As if in answer, we view a pair of cardinals, one male and one female, as they devour some seeds. With the fall of a new snow, it's time to make some snow creatures. In a surprising two page spread we see a brown paper sack and plastic bags full of stuff. The author says that this is &quot;good stuff&quot; saved for this very occasion. The rest of the book then displays snowmen, women, children, pets, etc. made out of everything from strawberries to orange plastic fish. Almost every snow person has something in their make up that is delicious to the wild birds, and occasionally a brave birdy will fly into the picture to nibble on a sunflower seed necklace or munch on a popcorn laden body. At the back of the book are actual size photographs against a white background displaying objects that were featured in the snowmen's bodies earlier. Kids reading the book will enjoy trying to find the page that presented the Guatemalan purse or the Thai applique heart. Finally, the reader can find out more about snow itself. Two pages full of snowman photos (all goofy in their own different ways) surround a section entitled, &quot;What makes it snow?&quot;. And for those of you that are lucky enough to be reading a hardcover edition of this tale, a recipe for popcorn balls appears on the back book flap.<br /><br />Admittedly, when you get right down to it, this book is just a paper cut out book after all. But Ehlert has taken the liberty of combining your normal run-of-the-mill paper images with life sized photographs of certain objects. If you look on the cover, you'll see that the bird sitting on the snowman's head is all paper while the piece of popcorn it holds in its beak is a photograph. The result is fairly seamless. We can assume that some Photoshopping has been done here since a couple of these photographed items occasionally cast shadows on their snowpeople. This is a fairly well put together little book. It's difficult to combine stories where fun hunt and peck tales are combined with scientific facts. I'm almost tempted to categorize this book as non-fiction for all its interesting information. Even a quick glance at the back cover consists of thirteen newspaper accounts of snowy weather.<br /><br />In a way, this book is like an educational &quot;Where's Waldo?&quot;. Kids reading it will probably have more fun trying to find the objects listed in the back of the book than they will reading about water droplets and the process of evaporation. Just the same, any book that sneaks a little science into the average child's diet is a-okay by me. You may not find much in the way of plot in this item, but there?s enough originality and fun packed in &quot;Snowballs&quot; to keep the doldrums away.n the liberty of combining your normal run-of-the-mill paper images with life sized photographs of certain objects.

And it's books like, &quot;Jumanji&quot; that remind me why I love his work as strongly as I do. For some reason, Van Allsburg's picture books are so popular and so evocative that they are continually adapted into full screen motion pictures. &quot;Polar Express&quot; has just been turned into a computer animated extravaganza, and &quot;Jumanji&quot; was a Robin Williams vehicle once. Just the same, nothing compares to the original tale. Using his uber-realistic illustrations to highlight how incredibly bizarre the storyline is, this book is fully worthy of the 1982 Caldecott Medal it was awarded.<br /><br />Peter and Judy have been left home alone by their opera going parents and boy are they boredy bored bored. After playing with their toys and making a mess they decide to take a run to the park. Once there, they discover an abandoned board game called Jumanji sitting beneath a tree. On a note taped to the bottom of the box read the words, &quot;Free game, fun for some but not for all. P.S. Read instructions carefully&quot;. The kids don't know what to expect but they take the game with them anyway. After reading the instructions they find that once a person begins Jumanji they cannot stop until someone has won the game. The first roll of the die leads to a space that reads, &quot;Lion attacks, move back two spaces&quot;. Suddenly there's a real live lion in the room, and it's regarding Peter hungrily. The kids realize, to their horror, that whatever happens on the board happens in real life. If they want to finish the game (and remain alive) they're going to have to continue.<br /><br />The book really plays on the old idea of &quot;when the parents are out the kids will get up to all kinds of unwitting mischief&quot;. There's a lot in this story that's similar to &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot;. Two bored kids. The magical entity that destroys their home but (undeniably) occupies their time. Getting everything cleaned up before mom and dad walk in the door. You get the idea. The story is surreal and skirts the edges of the disturbing. With illustrations created with Conte dust and Conte pencils, Van Allsburg makes the pictures especially realistic. You can make out every strand on Peter's head or observe delicate details on the rubber bands holding together Judy's braids. As a child, I was always fascinated with realistic images of fantastical situations. Van Allsburg fits this bill perfectly.<br /><br />&quot;Jumanji&quot; was later given a sequel of sorts entitled, &quot;Zathura&quot;. I haven't read it myself, but I think my loyalties will always lie with the original. There's something about Van Allsburg's clean lines and startled expressions that really chill the reader to the bone. If you have a child that likes to be ever so slightly freaked out from time to time, I can't think of any picture book artist that does a better job of this than the master of the pencil drawing: Chris Van Allsburg.

A book that seems primed for Middle School discussions due to its open-to-interpretation ending. This tale is the second in the Lois Lowry futuristic distopia trilogy. Beginning with &quot;The Giver&quot;, continuing through &quot;Gathering Blue&quot; and finishing with &quot;The Messenger&quot;, the tales tell the stories of utopias gone awry. Call them utopias gone dis, if you will. Though the first two books make only the most casual of allusions to one another, the third ties them all together. Each deals with how simple citizens of the world can begin to challenge authority on a basic every day level. As you might imagine, these books are banned from schools and libraries with breathtaking frequency. In &quot;Gathering Blue&quot; we read about a girl, her artistic talents, and her growing awareness of the world around her.<br /><br />Kira was born with a misshapen foot, a serious defect in the society in which she lives. Raised by her mother to be proud and strong, Kira must deal with her mom's untimely death and a village that is hostile to her presence. When brought before the village's Council of the Guardians, the rulers of this local berg, Kira is given a chance to become not only accepted but also admired. Adept with a needle and thread, she is given the challenge of restoring and improving the robe belonging to the Singer of Songs. While living within the council building she meets and befriends a boy who is adept with wood carving and a child that sings with incredible beauty. Yet as Kira learns more and more about her living situation and the world around her, it becomes painfully clear that those who have supposedly helped her in the past may be keeping her for their own devices. Kira must decide whether to leave this uncomfortable situation for a place that would welcome her freely or to stay and try to change the way things are.<br /><br />Anyone who is a fan of Lowry's books in this series won't be disappointed by this addition. Certainly it leaves the reader wanting more, but that's just the mark of a good writer. Personally, I was a little amazed to find these stories so very similar to Zilpha Keatley Snyder's &quot;Below the Root&quot; books. This isn't to say that Lowry stole Snyder's ideas, but rather that the plots in these books are universal and popular. Fans of &quot;The Giver&quot; who worried about Jonas's fate will find some comfort in the brief allusion made to him in this story. As with most of Lowry's tales, this book relies on strong characters and an airtight plot. At the same time, it accomplishes the difficult task of giving the reader some space to figure things out on his or her own. Few books do this well. &quot;Gathering Blue&quot; is one of the few.<br /><br />Though not as airtight a tale as &quot;The Giver&quot;, &quot;Gathering Blue&quot; raises some important questions about society itself. Those who blindly follow their leaders will inevitably end up in a harsh cruel world. It takes people like Kira, the artists and crazies, to call into question those who would make our decisions for us. In this day and age ESPECIALLY, this is an incredibly important lesson to remember and retain. For as long as this book remains read, it will hopefully help its readers to question authority. It's a strong message presented in a lovely little package.reader wanting more, but that's just the mark of a good writer.

597214:US	49148452	R1B86D8N1DVUAU	0816431345	636326271	The Little Spotted Fish	Books	4	1	1	N	N	The original rainbow fish	So I'm walking through my library the other day, having successfully located a couple fun children's books to read through, when my eye catches a cover I've never seen before. The book looks like nothing so much as a logical extension of that old Beatles movie, &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;. On its cover sita a bizarre rainbow colored fish with a mouth as wide as a cave and a ludicrously jutting jaw. Across from this fish leaps a little spotted fish with the face of a woman and rainbow colored water flowing from its tail. I stopped. I stared. And though I very rarely pick up picture books to read and review on a whim, I couldn't help it. I had to read through this book no matter what. The fact that it was written by Jane Yolen only clinched the deal.<br /><br />As the tale tells us, there was once a young fisherlad who lived all by himself on an island. He had everything he could want (as attested by his orange coveralls and black &amp; white suspenders) and he was well pleased with his fishing skills. One day, as he sat on the banks of a lake found deep in the woods, a mysterious boat called a coracle appeared out of nowhere. The lad hopped aboard and was immediately brought to a little spotted fish. After greeting him in a usual fishy matter (ala spitting water) the fish says to the boy:<br /> &quot;Dylan, Dylan, son of the wave,<br /> The spotted fish thy life shall save&quot;.<br /><br />Dylan (that's the lad's name, you see) doesn't quite know what to make of this, but he goes along with it just the same. Suddenly an uber-odd fish with a spectacularly jutting jaw approaches. At his feet, Dylan finds a magical rod. The rod defeats the fish and Dylan uses it afterwards to fish. However, the lad decides that it's too easy fishing with a magical fishing rod so he returns it to the spotted fish. Later, everything happens all over again. The coracle comes, the fish sings, and this time a magical net and two uber-odd fishies try to eat the boy. Again he defeats them, uses the net for a time, then decides to give it back to the spotted fish. Only the third time he jumps in the coracle the spotted fish spits out water &quot;as red as blood&quot; (yum!) and asked to be saved BY Dylan. Three fish appear and Dylan rescues the little one from the big nasties. They offer him wishes in exchange for her, but Dylan laughs and explains that he would wish for nothing, so they take off. Then the little fish sheds her silver scales (like the book &quot;Rainbow Fish&quot; but without the hokey message) and turns into a lovely girl. And they lived happily ever after.<br /><br />In her author's note at the end, Yolen explains that &quot;The Little Spotted Fish&quot; is a combination of several classic folktales, poems, and what have you. As an original story, it's fine. To be honest, I could take or leave it. It's Friso Henstra's bizarre trippy illustrations that bring this book to life and caught my eye in the first place. This book was originally published in 1975, and as such it's a crazy creation. You half expect Blue Meanies to come barreling through this tale for all its psychedelic glory. Henstra carefully balances his black and white (pen and ink) spreads with rainbow infused crazy creations. Details like the spotted fish having the face of a woman give the book an almost mythological feel and tone. And of course there are those insane monster fish that serve as the villains of the piece. They so immense and frightening (enough so that I suspect I'll be enjoying some mighty fine nightmares for a month or so) that they stick in one's brain long after reading the text. In short, the pictures in this book are inspired. I highly recommend them.<br /><br />What we have here is a formerly up and coming author pairing with a skilled artiste of a past age. The result is the frenzied and fantastical &quot;The Little Spotted Fish&quot;. Honestly, if you can get your hands on a copy of this puppy, you will NOT be disappointed. It's far more bizarrethan anything I've seen in a long long time. Read it to your kids. They'll adore it, I'm certain.I've seen in a long long time. Read it to your kids.

Some early young adult novels (it's a fairly new form of literature, you know) age gracefully and seamlessly. I'm thinking of course of Robert Cormier's &quot;The Chocolate War&quot; and (to a lesser extent), S.E. Hinton?s, &quot;The Outsiders&quot;. Unfortunately, I have a nasty suspicion that these books are the exception rather than the rule. For every &quot;Forever&quot; there's a &quot;My Darling, My Hamburger&quot; that contains a great story bogged down by changes in the world. While Paul Zindel's classic tale of four teenagers and their relationship problems is at times both moving and perfectly toned, mostly the problems presented in it are as dated as they come. Even a plot synopsis makes this apparent.<br /><br />Friends Maggie and Liz aren't exactly close, but they hang out frequently together. Liz is the more beautiful and popular of the two with Maggie often following behind. When Liz and her boyfriend Sean decide to hook up Maggie with his friend Dennis, the blind date is as incredibly awkward as they come. Throughout the book the narrative switches between Maggie and her tentative relationship with Dennis and Liz's problems with Sean. Sean, like any normal teenager, is as horny as they come and is continually pressuring Liz to have sex. She'd like to, but she worries that it might end up in pregnancy. Unsurprisingly, that is exactly what happens and soon the big question in the book is whether or not Sean will do the honorable thing and marry Liz (!!) or if Liz will seek out an illegal abortion on her own.<br /><br />It's this last plotline that struck me as dated. The book was originally written in 1969, a full three years before Roe V. Wade and in many ways this abortion issue (while it still looms large) isn't the same. Sure, many girls will sweat over what to do with an unplanned pregnancy, but crossing the border to a state where abortion is legal is probably a more up-to-date literary solution than getting a back alley job. Then there's the debate about whether a girl should marry the guy who gets her pregnant, regardless of how old they are or what their future plans are. Maybe there are pockets of the country where this really is the only honorable solution to such a problem, but it's really not how the majority of teens would handle it today. The book is additionally riddled with small cultural time capsules as well. Talk about how Orientals kill themselves for honor, going to the movie theater to watch a documentary on pygmies, and the complete and total lack of any mention of STDs all combine to make this book an interesting window into the past.<br />To some degree it does still speak to teens today. I was especially amused by the Sex Ed. teacher's advice on how to stop a guy from going all the way, (suggest going out for a hamburger). The characters were interesting as well. Liz, unfortunately, isn't a character you're going to identify with intrinsically. Yes, it's sad that she doesn't get along with her parents. But she's such a self-absorbed person, constantly ridiculing her best friend and at the same time dragging Maggie into horrid and dangerous situations, that by the end you feel zippo pity for her. In fact, you're supposed to end this story hating and pitying Sean who got her pregnant in the first place. Curse those lustful young men that refuse to marry their knocked up girlfriends! Curse them! This book probably read very well in the 1970s and I could even see it having some interesting points in the 1980s. But by the 1990s with the advent of AIDS better known and the options available to teens widening, books like this one began to read more as cautionary tales than as contemporary novels. I've no doubt that &quot;My Darling, My Hamburger&quot; was riveting and shocking when it first came out. Unfortunately, that's certainly no longer the case. I recommend it as a glimpse into the America that once was. If you'd like to know more about the history of the Young Adult novel, this is a good book to pick up. Just don't expect it to have too many insights to offer today. I'm afraid it's no longer that meaningful.k to pick up. Just don't expect it to have too many insights to offer today.

599011:US	49148452	R2MOV8YB2GTQ4N	0395524369	319727436	Shortcut	Books	4	5	5	N	N	This &quot;Shortcut&quot; is cut into shorts	Following up his success with the eclectic and Caldecott award winning, &quot;Black and White&quot;, from 1990, author David Macaulay decided to write another multiple narrative infused picture book. If you've read &quot;Black and White&quot;, you may remember how this kind of story works. Characters from different tales affect one another's lives and the reader has the joy of seeing how an action on the part of one person creates chaos or delight on the parts of others. The result is a meticulously crafted series of delicate vignettes, perfectly suited for the child reader. This is basically the equivalent of picture book jazz. And it works.<br /><br />There are eight major players in this tale (two of whom are non-human) and Macaulay has presented a helpful chart of each and every one at the beginning of the book. When it begins, an older gentleman named Albert is going with his horse June to the town for market day. On the way there, and unbeknownst to him, he inadvertently affects every other character's life. Because of Albert, Professor Tweet loses control of his hot air balloon and unwittingly saves Clarinda's escaped cockatoo. Because of June, Patty must search for her pet pig Pearl. Then there are the stories of the Sybil (a dead ringer for the little old lady from Pasadena) and Bob, the unwitting deep sea diver.<br /><br />Even as I looked through the pictures a third and fourth time, I still was able to locate clever little thoughts and details that I hadn't noticed before. The narrative in this story jumps between each character rapidly, sometimes double backing to clarify a situation or storyline. Probably this book will do best with those kids that are endowed with a little bit of patience. I can see this story striking some as being incredibly frustrating. After all, if you don't realize that each story is affected by every other story, a first read through is going to strike the child reader as disjointed and awkward. If they manage to grab ahold of the tale and get into it, however, they'll be enjoying a whole new kind of picture book. This is the kind of book that will prepare its younger readers for future books with eclectic narratives. For the kid that's still reading picture books but has a mind that likes clever details and stories, this might just be the perfect choice.le and get into it, however, they'll be enjoying a whole new kind of picture book.

In it, our narrator tells us in no small terms that due to a single lie, &quot;Somebody got shot because of it, and I had a visit with a beautiful naked girl who stood up in front of me early in the morning and talked in a foreign tongue, and I saw a ball game with a hundred men on one side, and a boat sank, somewhat, under me, and my brother Clayton started acting strangely and sleeping with a loaded rifle, and there were some more things too&quot;. Which is a good sentence to begin with. If you're going to spin a humorous yarn about the crazy things that can come from a single lie, that's a good way to begin. Unfortunately, the first page of this book is about as good as it gets. Though this book is on more than one list of &quot;Great Forgotten Children's Books&quot;, I have to admit that after reading it I came to the undeniable conclusion that it should remain forgotten. Though it tries for an easygoing vernacular and a series of crazy adventures in the vein of Mark Twain's &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;, instead it comes off as a loosely connected series of half-thought out ideas and schemes. I was sorely disappointed by it.<br /><br />Henry and Clayton are brothers living in the American South in 1848. Clayton, the older of the two, is unofficially courting Caroline, twin sister of a girl named Clytemnestra. When Clemmy (her nickname) tells the boys one day that Caroline stuffs her bras, Henry is sent by his distraught brother to raid the girl's chifforobe to see if this is true. Henry, however, chickens out and instead lies to his brother that he did the dirty deed and that Caroline does not stuff. To take Clayton's suspicious mind off of further questions, Henry goes even farther and makes up a completely random out-of-the-blue lie. He tells Clayton that he met a man that told him about a red haired girl that lives with the Indians and runs faster than the wind. This lie is an allusion to a cousin of the boys who disappeared years ago and is suspected to have been taken in by the Native Americans. Consequently, this lie catapults Clayton into action and suddenly he sees it as his god-given quest to find and rescue cousin Hanna from the heathen scourge. Which is to say, he'll make Henry do it.<br /><br />The rest of the book is a series of adventures in the course of this quest with Clayton becoming more pig-headed and &quot;godly&quot; (in his own eyes) as his little brother merely looking on. Parts of the story from here on in are amusing, but mostly the book's just plain annoying. I suspect author Clements decided that Clayton the buffoon would provide much of the comic relief in this tale. Unfortunately, Clayton's a painful read. He's racist to the point of homicide. He puts down Henry in every way he can, a fact that Henry never contests or questions. It's one thing to have a droll sweet natured narrator. It's another thing entirely to have a wimpy narrator traveling with the kind of brother that would shoot his own kin and later explain his mistake with talk of how the kin deserved it. Had the book been written without Clayton as a character I can't say it would've captured my heart, but it at least could've made a play for it.<br /><br />This isn?t to say that there aren't amusing parts to this story. The laugh out loud point of the book comes when Henry decides to write a mock love letter to Clemmy and use the most disgusting terms he can think up. Written in the form of a Shakespeare sonnet the poem contains such classic lines as:<br /> &quot;Tis true my holy love I'll throw up soon,<br /> And spread it all around beneath the moon!&quot;<br /><br />His follow up poem (entitled, &quot;The Love Lament of a Doomed Worm&quot;) is just as good. Unfortunately, they set me up and made me expect further hilarity. No such hilarity ensues.<br /><br />The greatest flaw to this book is the inability of its author to link scenes and ideas together properly. Therefore, Henry's random lie at the start of the tale comes from nowhere and hits the reader completely out of the blue. The fact that it later turns out to be true makes it even odder (not to mention coincidental when she turns out to be adopted by the book's only Native American character with a speaking part). Henry's continual acquiescence to his brother is not just annoying but frustrating. In some ways, this book feels like a work in progress. Almost as if this was the first draft with all the good ideas put together without much in the way of any semblance or order.<br /><br />So I was disappointed. This is not a great lost classic. It is a classic that is great because it's lost. Would that it remain lost a little longer and forgotten entirely in time. Except for the first page and Henry's poems, I wouldn't grieve its disappearance.Henry's random lie at the start of the tale comes from nowhere and hits the reader completely out of the blue.

599792:US	49148452	RME5IILSVWOG1	0395691206	375517499	Behind the Mask: The Life of Queen Elizabeth I	Books	5	30	33	N	N	The least frumpy queen on record	Take a look at the cover of this book for just a moment.  Just a single solitary moment.  Maybe the last thing you want to do is read a young adult biography on England's greatest queen, and I can understand where you're coming from.  But take a good long look at the image presented on the cover here.  This portrait of Queen Elizabeth was fashioned in her time and is commonly referred to as The Rainbow Portrait.  It is, to my mind, the most flattering painting ever made of the ruler and it hasn't been touched since she posed for it.  When you first look at it, it seems pretty standard.  There she is with the high forehead (considered attractive at the time), the bright curly red hair, and the ostentatious finery.  In fact, let's take a closer look at that finery.  If you look carefully you cannot help but notice that her gown is covered in ears and eyes.  You heard me right.  Honest to goodness ears and eyes are all over this thing!  You don't notice it at first, but once you've seen it you can never forget it.  Such is the case with Thomas's book itself.  It may not look like much at first, but once you take even a glance at the text you immediately become transfixed by the lives of Elizabeth, her crazy family, suitors, and enemies.<br /><br />Elizabeth was born the second child of the (in the words of the great comic Eddie Izzard) \\"big fat hairy king\\", Henry VIII.  Fond of killing off his wives when they either displeased him or couldn't produce male heirs, Elizabeth was the daughter of the soon-to-be beheaded Anne Boleyn.  Her life was touch and go from the start.  One minute she was treated as a prized pet and the next she was sent to royal grounds far from court.  What followed soon after was a series of deaths and accessions to the throne.  When Henry VIII died he was followed by Elizabeth's little half-bro Edward VI.  When Eddie died he was followed by the Lady Jane Grey (for nine days).  After she was tossed out came Elizabeth's older half-sis Mary (Bloody Mary to you commoners).  Finally, Mary kicked it and Elizabeth rose to the throne.  She was only 25 or 26 at the time and extraordinarily canny in the choices she made.  Refusing to marry (and thereby give up her ruling power) Elizabeth remained sexy and single.  Over the course of her life she dealt with assassination attempts, the continual threat of Mary Queen of Scots, an invasion of England by the Spanish Armada, excommunication, and all sorts of fun stuff.  The result?  Elizabeth remains perhaps the best remembered Queen of them all, making her an excellent subject of bios and bio-pics.<br /><br />I'm easily bored.  If I pick up a children's book that won a Newbery Award pre-1950 to read, you'll probably find me curled up in a corner fast asleep in five minutes time.  Non-fiction is therefore one of the banes of my existence and I heap large helpings of praise onto any author that can make a realistic subject even halfway interesting.  Not being familiar with Jane Resh Thomas, I was understandably nervous when I confronted this tome of a book and its 16th century subject.  To my vast relief, my fears were more than unfounded.  Here is a history book that has plumbed every interesting tidbit, rumor, factoid, and story for the eager ears of the reader.  Want to hear how Queen Elizabeth would expose her chest to foreign diplomats (to put them on edge, you see)?  Read it here.  Curious about her six foot tall rival who was a queen that disguised herself as a boy to gain English sanctuary?  It's a great tale.  None of this is to say that Thomas neglects actual informative facts about the Elizabethan era and its people.  In fact, this kind of information is so plentiful that it fills each and every page without ever drawing undue attention to itself.  I think I learned more about ancient court life within these pages than I could have hoped to anywhere else.<br /><br />In addition to fabulous factual storytelling and a wonderful ear for narrative, tension, and intrigue, Thomas has filled the book with numerous paintings of the characters involved, even going so far as to include Elizabeth's life in portraits as a color filled section of seven portraits that follow her through the years.  To help the easily confused (like my pretty self) there's a fabulous opening section that names and describes many of the book's major players.  There's also a portrait gallery of Henry VIII's wives and description of their mostly shortened lives.  The back of the book contains a useful chronology of events, a well-cited bibliography of every source Thomas used or even thought of using, and an index.  You're in safe hands with this thorough researcher.<br /><br />Thomas attempts in this book to show the life of Elizabeth without commenting on her too much.  Yes, Elizabeth could be as cruel and calculating as her predecessors and she wasn't afraid to \\"Off with their head\\" a couple of her closest compatriots.  In the end, however, she comes off as a remarkable woman.  Thomas leaves plenty of room for speculation on lurid topics that cover everything from Elizabeth's sex life to her love of sweets for dinner.  Nothing here is written in stone, but this is probably as good a teen biography of this great woman you're going to get for at least another one hundred years.  As someone who looked upon reading this book initially as a chore, I can tell you honestly that it was a joy to go through.

600013:US	49148452	RWW5NZYGQVE19	0689848935	218456430	Give a Boy a Gun	Books	3	8	9	N	N	Just misses the mark	When an author decides to write a story about a school shooting, the unwritten rule is that the author (unless a psychopath) is going to write a story that says school shootings are bad. We don't challenge this assumption because it's inherently moral. At the same time, any book that discusses school shootings shouldn't render the shooters as demonized villains. When kids start killing other kids the reasons are complex and deep. A simple, &quot;This is why it happened&quot;, is nearly impossible, and to this end Strasser is very adept. But here's where Strasser messes up: In &quot;Give a Boy a Gun&quot; we have two guys who live hellish lives and try to take it out on their persecutors. By the end of the book they've trapped everyone they hate in a gymnasium with guns and bombs. And at this point the reader SHOULD have been given enough information to say a) Yes, these boys are victims and I can understand where they're coming from and b) Killing people is wrong anyway. Strasser drills home the first point perfectly. Strasser misses the second point by a mile.<br /><br />Gary and Brendan (perfect middle-America names) hate high school. It's just their bad luck to be living in a particularly sports crazy town. In Middletown, the high school jocks are granted particularly galling dispensations. Because they can bring their team and town incredible glory, they are treated like gods both in and out of school. This means that anyone who tangles with the glorious football players will inevitably end up on the losing side. The jocks take advantage of this system fully, and it only comes to a head when Brendan, an outsider who's transferred from another town, refuses to cow tow. The more the jocks try to teach him a lesson the worse it gets for Brendan and his reclusive and depressive friend Brendan. To them, high school is just a daily torture-fest and there is no hope in sight. Driven to believe that the only way out is to kill as many people they hate as possible as well as themselves, the two come up with a plan to take over a school dance and wreak revenge. Told after the events took place, this book is a series of interviews with the people involved, as well as copious footnotes. These footnotes provide useful facts about gun ownership in America, offering a sly anti-gun commentary to the book's events.<br /> In a way, my favorite parts of this book were the footnotes. I mean, where else are you going to learn that the parents of the teen shooters in Jonesboro and Springfield were taught how to use guns as children, following the advice of the NRA? So two thumbs way way up for the factual evidence presented here. It's just the fictional portions I had problems with.<br /><br />For one thing, I think Strasser made a mistake placing this story in a high school that is SO obsessed with sports. Most high schools where school shootings take place are normal high schools. THAT is why it's so important that all schools take anti-bullying precautions. Not just the ones that treat their jocks as some kind of royalty. Next, the book completely fails to express the horror of school shootings. Though the two boys do shoot people, nobody is ever killed. I'm not bloodthirsty and I don't like violence one bit, but if you have two seriously pissed off adolescent boys facing the people who've supposedly destroyed their lives, shouldn't at least one person get killed? But that's the thing. Though the boys are constantly shooting bullets into the ceiling, though they shoot two adults at point blank range, though they are prepared to kill everyone in that room, miraculously only one person has wounds that even suggest he might die. It takes guts to have your book's protagonists (sorry, but technically that's what they are) do horrible things. Strasser lacks those guts.<br /><br />And speaking of horrible things, why is it never made clear that shooting a bunch of people is bad? Of the football players, you see several characters embody every villainous instinct imaginable. They're never fleshed out or made three-dimensional. If even one of the jocks that made the boys miserable said something even halfway interesting or (for lack of a better word) un-evil I'd be appeased. But Strasser likes dealing in black and white and that's it. The result is, when the boys start threatening to kill people you know that killing is bad but you're having a heckuva hard time not identifying with their need for blood. Characters say that what happened is awful and the reader isn't told why. Where is the discussion about the redeeming characteristics found in even the cruelest of popular clique members? Where is the diatribe against the circle of violence and how it never ends? We're given fact upon fact about the evil of guns but we?re never told WHY what they do is evil. This is a very serious flaw.<br /><br />I dunno. I mean, the book has a great series of appendixes in its back regarding school shootings that occurred while this book was being written, a partial list of school shootings, books to consult on the topic, magazine articles about it, web sites, etc. There's even a note saying how a portion of the money generated from this book will go towards organizations working to established tougher gun control laws. I really wish Strasser had done a non-fiction work on this subject rather than a fictional tale. If you want stirring stories about this kind of stuff look up Walter Dean Myers's, &quot;Shooter&quot; or Francine Prose's fabulous, &quot;After&quot;.inct imaginable.

600348:US	49148452	R1T6TOF0HECQVA	0803728484	411961434	The Spiffiest Giant in Town	Books	4	10	12	N	N	A whole new kind of BFG	Author Julia Donaldson acquired a faithful following of British readers when years ago she first penned her masterpiece, ?The Gruffalo?.  Unfortunately, America has yet to recognize this work formally and despite her numerous awards, Ms. Donaldson has not yet reached household name status in the States quite yet.  I decided to introduce myself to her work by reading a book that, to my mind, embodies silliness and morality twofold.  ?The Spiffiest Giant in Town? is, to be brief, about a spiffy giant.  And it?s top notch.<br /><br />Our hero in this tale is George the giant.  George lives in a small village that is an odd combination of fairy tale old and twenty-first century new.  In this particular village, giants are just ordinary citizens like anybody else.  It hasn?t escaped George?s notice that when it comes to clothing, he?s sorely in need.  Every day George wears the same old brown sandals and the same old-patched up gown (which looks like nothing so much as a linen dress).  Says George, ?I wish I wasn?t the scruffiest giant in town?.  One day, George sees that a store is selling giant sized clothing.  Delighted he purchases ?a spiffy shirt, a spiffy pair of pants, a spiffy belt, a spiffy striped tie?, and spiffy socks and shoes.  He leaves looking like an Assistant Bank Manager and soon he comes across a giraffe who?s missing a scarf.  George gives his tie to the giraffe to keep him warm then moseys out of town.  Next he sees a goat who?s lost his sail.  George?s shirt solves that problem forthwith.  You can see where this is going.  By the time everything is said and done George is severely depleted in terms of outerwear and his old clothes start looking a little less scruffy after all.  Better still, the animals he helped get together to show their appreciation, and George is undeniably lauded.<br /><br />First of all, I was delighted to discover that the opposite of ?scruffy? is ?spiffy?.  I mean, it makes perfect sense when you say it that way, but it isn?t one of those things they teach you in school.  George is such a likable hero that you?re rooting for him every step (and hop) of the way.  I was especially pleased to find that the little song he sings himself after every animal rescue, rhymes.  I can?t tell you how many books for kids I look through where even the simplest of rhymes either don?t work or are avoided altogether.  This story is about the rewards that come with simply making other people happy.  It?s a good strong message and one that I suspect too often gets lost in the shuffle of life sometimes.<br /><br />Honestly though?  I can?t claim that this book would have been even half the success that it is had it not been for artist Axel Scheffler.  Mr. Scheffler (also living in England at the moment) has a fine cartoony style that fits the action of this tale perfectly.  It's his details that make the book so great.  Like the fact that other giants live in the town (top and straw hats abound).  Or the fact that as George walks home in his clothes, his meticulously combed hair gets wilder and wilder and wilder.  There are lots of these tiny details in the story, and together they make it a fabulous read.  Could I have liked George half so much with a different artist?  Maybe.  But I wouldn?t count on it.<br /><br />In the end, the moral of this tale is that spiffiness comes in all kinds of sizes.  That sounds corny, but we?re dealing with a picture book here, people.  Let the corniness abound.  It?s just so pleasant to read a story like this that doesn?t condescend to its child audience and is a fun romp for parents as well.  If you?re the kind of person who upon seeing the word, ?Spiffiest?, in the title of a book, immediately wants to read it, this book is for you.  If that isn?t your reaction, good news.  This book is still for you.  Please feel free to take an inordinate amount of pleasure in it.  It'll do you a spot of good.of those things they teach you in school.

But I wouldn?t count on it.<BR> <BR>In the end, the moral of this tale is that spiffiness comes in all kinds of sizes.  That sounds corny, but we?re dealing with a picture book here, people.  Let the corniness abound.  It?s just so pleasant to read a story like this that doesn?t condescend to its child audience and is a fun romp for parents as well.  If you?re the kind of person who upon seeing the word, ?Spiffiest?, in the title of a book, immediately wants to read it, this book is for you.  If that isn?t your reaction, good news.  This book is still for you.  Please feel free to take an inordinate amount of pleasure in it.  It'll do you a spot of good.	2004-07-07

Inevitably the storylines run along these general lines: Our hero (Baby Duck) has some kind of childlike problem, be it anything from new glasses to going to school for the first time. After dealing with this problem in her own way and failing to illicit any real help from her parents, Baby Duck is inevitably reassured/guided wisely by her Grampa. The end. Kids like repetition and consistency, a fact that I have to assume contributes to the continual popularity of the &quot;Baby Duck&quot; series. Though a fine bunch o' books, I have to admit that I find them more than a little dreary. If you're a steadfast Baby Duck fan, then I have little doubt that this particular offering, &quot;You're The Boss, Baby Duck&quot; will live up to your expectations. If, on the other hand, you've been reading similar tales by such great children's book authors like Kevin Henkes or even David Small, then I'm afraid you're bound to wind up a little disappointed.<br /><br />Baby Duck is not pleased. There's a new baby in the house and nobody is paying any attention to our heroine. Babies, after all, aren't much use and Baby Duck is filled with jealousy. This isn't really her fault, though. Her parents are acting particularly negligent on this day in question, not even pausing a moment to hear their eldest child read to them. Fortunately for Baby Duck the family has gone to visit with Grampa. The wise elder sees his granddaughter's frustration at the new baby's presence. After some quickie counseling, Baby Duck attempts to show off and play with her little sibling. To her delight the baby (unlike her parents) responds to everything she does. The book ends with Baby Duck towing her sister in a wagon singing that maybe the baby can stay two more days, &quot;But Baby Duck is boss&quot;.<br /><br />A couple things. First we have to deal with Baby Duck's songs. I did some quick checking on this tale and this book was not originally published in another country. I say this because there was no getting around the fact that Baby Duck's song lyrics simply do not rhyme. I'm all for free verse, but it seems to me that if you write a song of four lyrics that scans perfectly, it should rhyme. Then I thought, &quot;Wait. Maybe the author is making a clever play on how little kids will constantly sing songs that rhyme only in their own heads&quot;. I was willing to give author Amy Hest some points for this idea, up until I hit Baby Duck's last song. Which rhymes. It may not seem like a big deal to you, but I'm a stickler for inconsistency ESPECIALLY in kid's books. If you're going to be consistent in any one medium, be sure it's in children's literature.<br /><br />But that's a pretty petty complaint. So I'll go one better. Amy Hest may well be an accomplished writer, but this is not the book to use to discover her. The phrase, &quot;You're the Boss, Baby Duck&quot; doesn't really fit in with the rest of the story. The characters are stock to the point of cardboard cutouts. The one thing I found original in this tale was Baby Duck's glasses, and that was a leftover from a previous adventure anyway. Jill Barton's illustrations are all well and good. She's especially good at bringing to Baby Duck's eyes a glare of detestation towards her little sib. There are cute little touches that pop up throughout this tale, including baby Hot Stuff's casual overboard tossing of her pacifier. Still, these illustrations can't save an otherwise bland tale.<br /><br />There are plenty of places to go for I'm-Jealous-Of-The-New-Baby books. My personal favorite is &quot;Julius, Baby of the World&quot; by Kevin Henkes. I suggest you take a good long look at the selections out there and purchase one of them instead of the nice, but ultimately blah, &quot;You're the Boss, Baby Duck&quot;. If you want a book that is comforting and doesn't challenge young readers in much of any way, this is an excellent choice. If you'd like something a little less run-of-the-mill and a little spicy, try the aforementioned &quot;Julius&quot; or (even better) Charlotte Voake's, &quot;Ginger&quot;. Why settle for less?mething a little less run-of-the-mill and a little spicy, try the aforementioned &quot;Julius&quot; or (even better) Charlotte Voake's, &quot;Ginger&quot;.

Recently I had the exceedingly wonderful chance to see the new musical of &quot;A Year With Frog and Toad&quot; at the Minneapolis Children's Company. A fabulous production in and of itself, it got me to thinking about the original books on which the musical is based. Like many children I was raised on such books as the lovely, &quot;Frog and Toad Are Friends&quot; and I've remembered some of the stories fairly well. It's amazing to me that Arnold Lobel was able to write stories that are patient simple without ever being dull or pedantic. These stories are clear and concise and unaccountably lovely. For your average early reader I not only recommend, &quot;Frog and Toad Are Friends&quot; but I recommend it to the reader's parents, grandparents, school crossing guards, dentists, air traffic controllers, and anybody else who might just happen to be able to speak the English language.<br /><br />In &quot;Frog and Toad Are Friends&quot; the book consists of roughly five short stories. The first is one of my favorites. In it, Frog has decided to wake Toad from his hibernation and introduce him to the new spring. Toad's response is, &quot;Blah&quot;. Frog tries a number of different methods of luring his friend into the warm beautiful day, the most touching of which is his simple argument, &quot;But, Toad, I will be lonely&quot;. Frog's eventual solution is to fast-forward Toad's calendar a little, making it instantly May. Toad is a little shocked at the date but he's happy to see the spring weather. In the second tale, Frog is sick and Toad attempts to take care of him. His different methods of coming up with a story to tell his friend inevitably lead to his own illness, however, and soon it is Frog telling Toad a story instead. The story &quot;A Lost Button&quot; shows Frog and Toad out looking for Toad's lost button. They find a variety of them but none are Toad's. He walks off in a huff only to find the missing item on his living room floor. Feeling guilty about yelling at his best friend he sews all the buttons onto his jacket and then gives it as a gift to Frog. The next story is an atypical tale, mostly because it doesn't end with a preachy moral (not that Lobel's stories tend to, but this one was ripe for it). In it, Frog and Toad go swimming. Frog prefers to swim au naturale but Toad has a fastidious bathing suit that he is certain everyone will laugh at. After the two swim Toad refuses to get out of the water until the crowd that has gathered at the water's edge to see his suit disperse. They don't and Toad reveals a suit that was probably in style in 1923. Even Frog laughs too. Finally, in the last story Toad mentions to Frog that he is unhappy because he never gets letters. Frog writes him one but delivers it via their friend Snail (a character that in the play version of this tale says that he, &quot;Puts the go in escargot&quot;). The two wait and long before the snail arrives Frog tells Toad what is in the letter so that the two are better friends for it. Three days later, Toad is happy to receive his message.<br /><br />This particular collection of Frog & Toad tales doesn't contain ALL the classics. You will not find the cookie eating tale here, nor the story about Toad dreaming about Frog growing smaller and smaller. Still, this is an excellent collection. I guess I never really noticed the subtlety of Lobel's illustrations. When you think of &quot;Frog and Toad&quot; you think of their realistic eyes and bodies. You think of their tweed jackets and elegant striped pants. What you may not think of is their capacity for subtle expressions. The image of Toad walking in his bathing suit, head held high, away from his fellow animals by the river is worth the price of admission alone. Ditto the shot of Toad clutching his aching noggin after ramming it into a wall.<br /><br />I can't really stress the simple elegance of &quot;Frog and Toad&quot; to you if you haven't read them before. Needless to say, you won't even mindthe fact that not a character in any of these tales ever uses a contraction. It's sometimes near impossible to write really good early reader books. I think Arnold Lobel set the bar way too high when he penned these extraordinary tales. If you've never read them, you are seriously missing out.t that not a character in any of these tales ever uses a contraction. It's sometimes near impossible to write really good early reader books.

Having breezed through the sweet, &quot;A Treeful of Pigs&quot;, stopped to admire his treasury of nursery rhymes (two thumbs way way up on that one), and genuflected in the face of the eternally classic tales of Frog and Toad I'm actually getting around to reading his 1981 Caldecott winning picture book, &quot;Fables&quot;. Lobel deserves every inch of praise he received for this admirable work. Imagine how difficult it must have been to create not one, not two, but twenty absolutely new fables filled to the brim with wit and wisdom! Not an easy task. Still, Lobel not only faced up to the challenge but also accomplished it in a manner best befitting the gentleman he truly was. These are fabulous fables.<br /><br />Each tale contained in this book is acted out by a variety of different animals. No two stories contain the same kind of animals (with the possible exception of one fable centering on a hen and another on a rooster). The stories are short and easy for youngsters to understand. They are usually followed up with little moral lessons along the lines of &quot;At times, a change of routine can be most healthful&quot; or &quot;When the need is strong, there are those who will believe anything&quot;. Admittedly, these are half a step away from becoming fortune cookie messages. Still, there's no denying that each and every one is true. Sometimes they become particularly poignant. I am thinking of the story about a young mischievous kangaroo that would throw spitballs in school and put tacks on chairs. When his teacher went to his home to inform his parents of their son's terrible behavior, he found them throwing spitballs at one another and doing just the kinds of things the little one had done in school. Moral: &quot;A child's conduct will reflect the ways of his parents&quot;. Truer than most would think.<br /><br />Accompanying these droll adventures are Lobel's very particular illustrations. As an artist, Lobel has given an entirely new level of sophistication to his creations. Though undeniably Lobellian (is that a word?) they're far more detailed than anything much his work before or since. In the story where a pig dreams of candies all night, the image on the opposite page displays a subtley shaded porcine character flying next to a gorgeous moon, a melange of greens and yellows. Other delightful pictures include the one accompanying the story of two elephants. The pompous father elephant reads his paper, oblivious to the fact that his left slipper has caught fire from his pipe. Standing in front of him, eyes at half-mast (a look of singular disinterest on his face) a younger elephant gazes at the blaze serenely. Children familiar with Lobel's &quot;Frog and Toad&quot; books might be ever so slightly disturbed by the story in which three frogs run to find the treasures at the end of the rainbow. Not only do the jacketed amphibian get eaten by a snake, but they all look a heckuva lot like Frog from the aforementioned popular series. Things to consider.<br /><br />The tales told here are as well written and presented as an ancient Aesopian collection. I would greatly encourage you to pair this book with, &quot;Anno's Aesop: A Book of Fables by Aesop and Mr. Fox&quot;. The books compliment one another and lead to similar sillinesses. If you've ever thought that you loved Lobel, think again. Until you've read this picture book you'll find you were completely in the dark regarding his real talents.

Most are simply awful. They either tell tales that are loose plots barely supported by facts or they paste together a slapdash concoction of truth and fiction with as little thought as possible. The truly beautiful bio-picture books out there are as rare as hummingbirds in autumn. So it was with great joy that I located &quot;Wilma Unlimited&quot; and found it to be not only inspirational but also a darned good read. Written by Kathleen Krull (the woman who could make long dead musicians fascinating in &quot;Lives of the Musicians&quot; and bring Cesar Chavez to life in the recent &quot;Harvesting Hope&quot;) and illustrated by David Diaz the book is the best possible way to introduce kids to one of the world's greatest athletes.<br /><br />Born in 1940 to a family of twenty-one people (nineteen siblings, no less), Wilma Rudolph was initially a sickly child. Though she was energetic enough, she often caught every disease imaginable. At the age of five, Wilma's left leg twisted inward and it was clear that she'd come down with polio. Still, Wilma was a determined child and she consistently exercised her unruly leg to get stronger. After continual practice, she was finally able to walk free of the leg brace that had weighed her down. At twelve the brace was put away for good and Wilma started participating in sports. She led her high school basketball team to the finals, catching the eye of a college coach. Before you knew it, Wilma was recruited into the Tennessee State University's track-and-field team on a full ride scholarship. In 1960 she competed in the Olympic Games in Rome. The book sets this part up beautifully. Wilma arrived with a twisted ankle into a place filled with television cameras (the first time they ever filmed the Olympics), the place &quot;shimmering heat&quot;, and her competition consisting of runners who had run faster races than she ever had. Then Wilma proceeds to win one... two... three gold medals! The last medal is especially dramatic, hinging on the moment when Wilma drops her baton and STILL beats the other runners in the 400-meter relay. The last double page spread in this book shows Wilma standing, &quot;tall and still, like a queen&quot;, earning the last of her three medals. It's a truly proud moment for all who have the privilege to experience it once again in picture book form.<br /><br />Krull has a way with words. I'm not saying that Wilma Rudolph's life is dull. Far from it. But in the hands of a lesser author this story could easily have been bogged down in all the wrong moments. This author knows which moments should be given full glory. The moment when Wilma removes her brace and walks proudly into church will banish from your mind that similar pseudo-inspirational moment in &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;. Wilma's struggle at the Olympics through pain and skepticism puts the reader through the same strains. You yearn for this woman to beat them and beat 'em she does. Then, best of all, come the illustrations of David Diaz. This is my first Diaz experience, though I suspect that I'll read many more of his books as the days go on. Diaz has accompanied his illustrations in this tale with sepia toned photographs. The book's endpapers display the outlines of footprints in the dirt. The title page is an evocative view of ivy climbing a raw wooden fence. Behind his colorful illustrations, each background photograph refers to the corresponding scene obliquely. When Wilma and her mother take the bus to the hospital, the photograph is a close-up of a wheel. When she packs away her leg brace, it's shredded packing paper. A great relief it is indeed that the colored illustrations are worthy of their sepia compatriots. Though these pictures may appear blunt at first, they are filled with the most delicate of designs. I loved watching the character of Wilma as she aged. As she grows in confidence, her posture improves and back stiffens until, by the last shot, she is standing taller than all the women around her. Than all the women in the world.<br /><br />&quot;Wilma Unlimited&quot; should be known to everyone living in American today. This is inspirational without being either annoying or faux-patriotic. It's an actual honest-to-goodness amazing story. The book is beautiful and its story is worthy of its packaging. I challenge you to read it and not shake your head at least once in amazement. It's just that good.he last shot, she is standing taller than all the women around her.

The success of the series is undeniable, and it has the unique additional factor of being equally interested to both men and women.  A rarity in comics, I assure you.  I had never really read any Sandman before, so I decided to begin at the very beginning.  With \\"Preludes and Nocturnes\\", you meet the hero of this series naked in a glass container.  My kind of show!<br /><br />With his siblings Death, Destiny, Despair, Desire and others, Dream is one of the Endless that rule at the edges of humanity.  In a makeshift ceremony, a cult attempting to capture Death herself find that they have instead captured Morpheus/ the King of Dreams/ the Sandman/ etc.  After 75 years, Dream finds a way to escape his captivity, only to find that things have gone horribly wrong in his absence.  Three of his tools in which he kept much of his magic have gone missing.  Worse still, his very kingdom has disintegrated.  To restore it, Dream much locate his items and defeat a villain that wants to use Dream's power to destroy humanity itself.<br /><br />Oh it's definitely a disturbing tale.  No question.  There are elements in this story that will haunt you long after you put the book down.  Oddly, Dream's visit to Hell is probably one of the tamer tales.  Still, it's well written.  There's nothing like a good quest tale to keep the reader wanting more.  The final chapter in this series introduces the reader to Death, Dream's somewhat punk rock sister.  Funny fact:  Death's a big fan of Mary Poppins.  Who knew?  Drawing in elements of everything from Alice in Wonderland to 1950s and 60s pop songs that discuss dreams, dreaming, and the sandman (of which I think there may have been roughly 4 billion) as well as Shakespeare, ancient Celtic myth, and even the original Cain and Abel story, Gaiman goes wild.  Remarkably, he does all of this and yet never looses his grip on the tale he's telling.  Things are never so wild that they get completely out of hand.<br /><br />The art in this book is created by the fingers of three meticulous artists.  Of them, I had a hard time deciding which I liked best.  I'm not an able reviewer of graphic artists, so I can't say who did which story and what style goes with whom.  What I can say is that as the stories continue, Dream himself grows and changes.  Though he retains his essential look, he goes from contemptuous to thin and drawn to Robert Smith.  The last story in the collection, \\"The Sound of Her Wings\\" is probably the weakest of the book.  While it's wonderful to see Death so perky and mischievous, I was disappointed by the story's hero suddenly looking so much like the lead singer of The Cure.  Instead of the Endless master of night and dreams, we have a pouting teenaged kid.  Go figure.<br /><br />Just the same, this is an excellent starter graphic novel.  For the person uncertain as to whether or not accept this art form as actual \\"literature\\" (and it's going to be many many years before this mindset becomes standard) this book may not convince them wholeheartedly, but it will at least give them something to think about.  A great dark tale with a great dark sexy hero.  No wonder the ladies like him so.billion) as well as Shakespeare, ancient Celtic myth, and even the original Cain and Abel story, Gaiman goes wild.

601741:US	49148452	R30FN8MR2D1LEU	0763619299	214639948	Can't You Sleep, Little Bear?: Special Anniversary Printing	Books	5	21	22	N	N	Short term hibernation	Here's a doozy of a question for you. How is it that British picture books have cornered the market on the old scared-of-the-dark theme? I am referring, of course, to not only &quot;The Owl Who Was Afraid of the Dark&quot; but also the delightful, &quot;Can' You Sleep, Little Bear?&quot; Both British, these books have won wild applause and great heaping helpfuls of praise from professional and (ahem) amateur reviewers alike. In the case of the Waddell and Firth book, &quot;Can't You Sleep, Little Bear&quot; was once referred to by none other than the Sunday Times of London as, &quot;the most perfect children's book ever written or illustrated&quot;. High praise that is not generally amiss.<br /><br />Big Bear and Little Bear live in a somewhat hibernationless state of their own. One day they play all day in the sunlight and at night return to their comfy cave. After tucking Little Bear into bed, Big Bear tells the young 'un to go to sleep, retiring to his own claw footed (and armed) comfy chair to catch up on some reading. Unfortunately, Little Bear cannot fall asleep. He points out that there is a lot of dark around them and that it frightens him. Big Bear accommodates the small fry by providing a little nightlight lantern for the nightstand. But Little Bear is still afraid. With well hidden reluctance, Big Bear puts down his very interesting story and gets Little Bear a bigger light. When that (again) doesn't work he brings in something that the book calls, &quot;the Biggest Lantern of Them All&quot;. But STILL Little Bear is afraid. After all, there's no denying that outside the cave the dark is all around. Taking Little Bear out into the nighttime, Big Bear offers the only comfort he can. He presents to Little Bear the moon and all the stars in the sky. Finally convinced that he is safe from the dark, Little Bear falls into a sound slumber and the two bears cuddle up in front of the roaring fire where Big Bear can finally finish his book.<br /><br />The text has the nice repetitive structure and comforting protagonists that kids will be readily drawn to. Little Bear is never obnoxious in his fears, instead acting very much the toddler as he hops about his bed, unable to find rest. Likewise, there?s a comfort to Big Bear's patient nature. Every time he puts down his book we are told how many pages are left until &quot;the interesting part&quot; (a number that corresponds to the moment when Big and Little Bear step outside their cave into the dark night). He remains a calm sturdy presence, offering comfort and love to the little one. Waddell's text is matched superbly with Barbara Firth?s illustrations too. The first picture in the entire book is a view, from a distance, of the two bears standing in thick white snow, a little ways from their cave. The light in this scene suggests that it just might be late afternoon in a winter month, a beautiful thing to suggest. Once inside the cave, each picture is filled with tiny delightful details. There's a trophy of a bear shot putting with the words, &quot;Ursa Major&quot; underneath. There's an open jar of honey and a photograph of the two bears wearing identical striped shirts. In Little Bear's room the light from the Biggest Lantern of Them All reveals marionettes and handmade pictures. The interactions between the characters are especially touching. When Big Bear leads the little one up the cave's steps in the night, he holds Little Bear's paws as the small creature works at the stairs one at a time. From the shot of Little Bear snuggled against the big one's shoulder to his fearful pointing towards a darkened corner of the cave, this book rightly earns itself the moniker of &quot;charming&quot;.<br /><br />Lots of picture books deal with fears. From the odd, &quot;Go Away, Big Green Monster&quot; to the delightful, &quot;There's a Nightmare in My Closet&quot; these books serve to empower kids to some degree. They give little ones the power to face their fears and deal with themas they see fit. &quot;Can't You Sleep, Little Bear&quot;, recognizes the importance of giving toddlers' fears a voice, but it also understands the necessity of strong adults in a child's life. Because the exact nature of the relationship between the two bears is unclear (are they father and son, brothers, or just friends?) this book serves to speak to a variety of different family situations. On top of that, it's sweet as honey on the vine.

An early reader chapter book designed to give full all-encompassing glory to language itself! Sort of. I first heard about &quot;Frindle&quot; some five years ago when it was burning up the bookshelves across the country. Kids couldn't get enough of the semi-raucous tale of one boy's attempt to make a contribution to the English language. Cleverly, author Andrew Clements has created a book that doesn't fall back into the old good vs. bad/teacher vs. student riff we all know so well. Though a book that is written with fairly young readers in mind, it successfully renders huge themes in bite size portions.<br /><br /> Nick Allen is used to getting great ideas. Who could forget his fabulous third grade attempts to turn his classroom into a sunny tropical isle in the dead of winter? Or his successful utilization of bird calls to annoy a fourth grade prof? But now Nick has come across a real challenge and her name is Granger. Mrs. Granger. As the woman in charge of the elementary school's language arts, Mrs. Granger is a true aficionado of the wonders of the dictionary. After tangling, and losing, with the clever teacher, Nick springs upon a brilliant idea. Why not add his own little word to the world's vocabulary? The idea comes to him in a flash, and before you know it he's grabbed the nearest pen and renamed it &quot;frindle&quot;. As Mrs. Granger retaliates, defending (what in her mind is) the perfectly serviceable and already existing word &quot;pen&quot;, frindle's popularity and publicity grows and grows. Yet in the end, it seems as though Nick was playing into Mrs. Granger's hands all along.<br /><br /> Accompanied by the really well wrought and beautifully designed illustrations of Brian Selznick, the book is just a low-key amusing look at how words affect people. Clements includes an array of interesting facts and ideas, some of which even adults will find themselves astounded by. For example, the book states that in 1791 a Dublin theater manager made up the word, &quot;quiz&quot; on a bet and that this word was (until the creation of &quot;frindle&quot;) the only word in the English language made up for no particular reason. I tried to ascertain if this was true by glancing through my impossibly old Webster's Third New International Dictionary. When I looked up &quot;quiz&quot; I hit the following sentence: Unknown origin. That's proof enough for me, though I'm sure a glance through the OED would clear everything up. And how many books written with middle readers in mind give you such clever facts couched in an interesting story? I was delighted with the characters in this book. From clever Nick and his ideas to Mrs. Granger, an adult who is truly an intelligent match. Any villainy this book presents later turns out to be no more than a clever ruse. So kudos for giving teachers the credit they deserve at last! Kudos indeed.<br /><br /> A good pairing of books of this reading level with similar protagonists would be &quot;Frindle&quot; and the slightly more recent Lois Lowry offering &quot;Gooney Bird Greene&quot;. Both books observe the use of language and how it affects us and both have clever red headed protagonists that defy all expectations. I doubt you could find two better books to present to kids with the hopes of getting them involved in reading. I give &quot;Frindle&quot; an especially warm recommendation and I am sure kids will be inspired by it. Go! Read!

I am a huge fan of &quot;Lily's Purple Plastic Purse&quot; and I found a great deal of enjoyment in &quot;Owen&quot; (though I feel it's not his strongest work). Even &quot;Wemberly Worried&quot; covers a lot of ground by directly confronting the fears of worrywarts everywhere. With &quot;Chrysanthemum&quot;, Henkes discusses originality and how being different (even if you're different in name alone) can single you out in both good and bad ways. As a Henkes fan, I consider this book to be amongst his strongest.<br /><br />Chrysanthemum feels that her name is absolutely perfect. She likes how it looks and she likes how it sounds and she likes that it is her name alone. Everything's going great until Chrysanthemum starts school. Suddenly everyone's making fun of her name. She has a class full of Sams and Eves and Victorias. There doesn't seem to be a place for a girl with as wildly original a name as Chrysanthemum. One student in particular, Victoria, makes it her goal to continually ridicule poor little Chrysanthemum day in and day out. Talking about it with her parents helps a little, but the next day the same thing occurs. It seems that Chrysanthemum is doomed to be unhappy until she meets the music teacher Mrs. Twinkle. Mrs. Delphinium Twinkle. And suddenly everything in Chrysanthemum's life is a whole lot better.<br /><br />I liked the moral of this lesson and the way in which Chrysanthemum learns that it's okay to be original. I also liked the epilogue in this tale wherein the leader of Chrysanthemum's tormentors abruptly forgets her lines in the school play and our little heroine is vindicated. Call me shallow, but I always enjoy it when the villains in a piece &quot;get their's&quot;. This is probably indicative of a singular shallowness on my part. Just the same, the fact that the similarly tormented Molly of the children?s book, &quot;Molly's Pilgrim&quot; never receives any vindication has always bothered me. So kudos to Kevin Henkes for punishing the bad guys mildly! Hear hear!<br /><br />There are other less personally petty things I like about this book too. I always love a good Henkesian drawing. I love that the parents in these tales are always caring, available, and attentive to their children's needs. In this book I was especially amused by Chrysanthemum's father running to child psychology texts (like &quot;The Inner Mouse Vol. 1: Childhood Anxiety&quot; and &quot;A Rose By Any Other Name...Understanding Identity&quot;) to help his daughter. I loved the extraordinarily cool Mrs. Twinkle with her hugely pregnant stomach, ballet shoes, and tail that twists into a musical staff. I loved it all.<br /><br />If you have a child being teased by fellow classmates for being a little off, this may not be THE best book to offer, but it's pretty darn good. Give it a shot and see what you think. If you love Henkes, you won't be disappointed.my part.

Having breezed through the sweet, \\"A Treeful of Pigs\\", stopped to admire his treasury of nursery rhymes (two thumbs way way up on that one), and genuflected in the face of the eternally classic tales of Frog and Toad I'm actually getting around to reading his 1981 Caldecott winning picture book, \\"Fables\\".  Lobel deserves every inch of praise he received for this admirable work.  Imagine how difficult it must have been to create not one, not two, but twenty absolutely new fables filled to the brim with wit and wisdom! Not an easy task.  Still, Lobel not only faced up to the challenge but also accomplished it in a manner best befitting the gentleman he truly was.  These are fabulous fables.<br /><br />Each tale contained in this book is acted out by a variety of different animals.  No two stories contain the same kind of animals (with the possible exception of one fable centering on a hen and another on a rooster).  The stories are short and easy for youngsters to understand.  They are usually followed up with little moral lessons along the lines of \\"At times, a change of routine can be most healthful\\" or \\"When the need is strong, there are those who will believe anything\\".  Admittedly, these are half a step away from becoming fortune cookie messages.  Still, there's no denying that each and every one is true.  Sometimes they become particularly poignant.  I am thinking of the story about a young mischievous kangaroo that would throw spitballs in school and put tacks on chairs.  When his teacher went to his home to inform his parents of their son's terrible behavior, he found them throwing spitballs at one another and doing just the kinds of things the little one had done in school.  Moral: \\"A child's conduct will reflect the ways of his parents\\".  Truer than most would think.<br /><br />Accompanying these droll adventures are Lobel's very particular illustrations.  As an artist, Lobel has given an entirely new level of sophistication to his creations.  Though undeniably Lobellian (is that a word?) they're far more detailed than anything much his work before or since.  In the story where a pig dreams of candies all night, the image on the opposite page displays a subtley shaded porcine character flying next to a gorgeous moon, a m&eacute;lange of greens and yellows.  Other delightful pictures include the one accompanying the story of two elephants.  The pompous father elephant reads his paper, oblivious to the fact that his left slipper has caught fire from his pipe.  Standing in front of him, eyes at half-mast (a look of singular disinterest on his face) a younger elephant gazes at the blaze serenely.  Children familiar with Lobel's \\"Frog and Toad\\" books might be ever so slightly disturbed by the story in which three frogs run to find the treasures at the end of the rainbow.  Not only do the jacketed amphibian get eaten by a snake, but they all look a heckuva lot like Frog from the aforementioned popular series.  Things to consider.<br /><br />The tales told here are as well written and presented as an ancient Aesopian collection.  I would greatly encourage you to pair this book with, \\"Anno's Aesop: A Book of Fables by Aesop and Mr. Fox\\".  The books compliment one another and lead to similar sillinesses.  If you've ever thought that you loved Lobel, think again.  Until you've read this picture book you'll find you were completely in the dark regarding his real talents.

602173:US	49148452	R2X7T9M6K9YJA6	0440229383	764809195	Whale Talk	Books	5	31	31	N	N	Got a whale of a tale to tell you friends...	A good book rises above its own premise. Reading a short synopsis of this story without knowing anything about it beyond its plot could easily suggest to the average viewer that it's going to be awful. Think about it. A multi-racial protagonist and his motley crew of rag tag misfits puts together an unlikely swim team and everybody learns a little bit about what it's like to walk in another person's shoes. Bleaugh! That's the kind of After School Special plotting that can get a book seriously ignored by its intended audience. Now I had never read a Chris Crutcher book coming into this. Frankly, I know the man has a reputation for producing darned good books. Then I read &quot;Whale Talk&quot; and found, to my incredible relief, that this was not really a book about a swim team. It's about the circle of abuse and the amount of control an individual has over his or her own actions. It's about hurting other people and what the cost of that can be. In short, the book takes amazingly gigantic themes, renders them bite size, and gives them humanity and humor. It's the humor part that really impressed me.<br /><br />T.J. Jones (actual name The Tao Jones... pronounce it, I dare you) is probably one of three people of color in his small Washington town. Adopted by his parents when he was a seriously abused toddler, T.J.'s a pretty well put together kid. That's probably in no small part due to his amazing mom and dad and his fantastic (some might say godlike) child therapist, Georgia. Which isn't to say that T.J.'s life is bereft of odd problems. His favorite teacher, Simet, is trying to lure T.J. into helping him start a school swim team. There are a couple problems with this plan. For one thing, T.J. refuses to join any organized sports. Cutter High School is run by and for its jocks. These jocks have been trying for years (unsuccessfully) to get T.J. onto one of their teams. Also, the school has no swimming pool. So T.J. isn't exactly thrilled about the idea of getting roped into this situation until he sees some of the local heavies beating up a mentally handicapped kid because he refuses to stop wearing his dead jock brother's letter jacket. Suddenly our hero has a mission, and the mission is clear. To create a swim team comprised of the kind of guys who otherwise could never be able to get involved in an organized sport. Even better, he's going to get each and every one of them a letter jacket.<br /><br />This is just the barest of outlines describing this book. T.J. has a lot going on in his life and this includes his father's guilt about accidentally killing a toddler some thirty years before, a girl who tries continually to wash her skin clean of pigment, her psychotic father who is both a wife abuser and T.J.'s enemy, and a team that becomes closer as their problems become clearer. This is truly a book written about a man for men. Which isn't to say that girls won't love this tale, or that it's bereft of strong female characters. In fact, Crutcher is especially good at balancing women who've been abused in the past with their far stronger counterparts. No, when I say that this is a boy book, I'm referring to the fact that the central focus of this story rests squarely on the male swimming team. Sure, T.J. has a girlfriend but her presence in this story is probably just to prove to the viewer that he's a well adjusted guy with a well adjusted gal. Honestly, his relationship is not the focus of this tale. And that's kinda refreshing.<br /><br />I think what I liked best about this book was that it recognized that behind every crazed idiot, there's a reason they act the way they do. Crutcher isn't the best young adult writer that knows about abuse (that honor belongs squarely to Alex Flinn) but he comes close. A person could learn more from reading this book about the cyclical nature of violence than they would from almost any other source. I'm praising the book, but it's not without the occasional flaw. Consider, for example, the character of Tay-Roy. This is a bodybuilder that joins the team and has, basically, no real personality. As far as I could determine, everything Tay-Roy does could have been accomplished by T.J. They're similar in every respect, except that Tay-Roy's white and slightly better looking. It's odd that Crutcher would have kept himself from omitting extraneous characters like this one, but as flaws go, this one's pretty minimal. The worst I can say is that it slightly derails the flow of the text. Big whoop.<br /><br />What Crutcher has as a writer that puts him heads and tails above and beyond his peers (some, at any rate) is his sense of humor. You cannot dislike a book where the main character is named The Tao Jones. You just can't. I mentioned that I think that Alex Flinn is the all-powerful guru of abused teens, but what Crutcher doesn't have in superior knowledge he makes up for in funnies. I'm sick and tired of all the deadly depressing books out there. If every writer could fill their texts with half as much pleasurable writing as Mr. C, I'd have a heckuva harder time figuring out which book to read next. In the end, &quot;Whale Talk&quot; accomplishes that mighty difficult task of being a good book about a near impossible subject. Abuse. Whether or not you agree that Crutcher wrote about this topic with the correct amount of respect, you have to admit he wrote about it well. I tip my hat to the man who's books I will now have to devour one by one to satiate my now uncontrollable young adult literature craving. Such is life.ter of Tay-Roy.

606930:US	49148452	R1VT6SOXNYHTEN	0689820089	912532458	The Table Where Rich People Sit (Aladdin Picture Books)	Books	4	51	54	N	N	Sit a spell	You may not be able to tell from where you read this, but at this moment in time I am punching myself roundly.  Why?  For the simple reason that I made a bizarre and irrational assumption about this book when I first heard about it.  Picture this... it is 1997 and I'm rooming with a dear hippie friend in a Quaker college dorm.  She's describing to me her favorite book: \\"The Table Where Rich People Sit\\" by Byrd Baylor.  As she explains the plot of the book to me, even (I now sigh) handing me a copy, I jump to what I felt was a logical conclusion.  Obviously this book was originally published in the 1970s.  After all, it deals with the price of happiness, the glory of the natural environment, and the beauty of the world around us.  Flash forward some seven years later and I'm reading \\"The Table Where Rich People Sit\\" once again.  It is, undoubtedly, a magnificently beautiful book in all respects.  Then I flip to the publication page and find the year \\"1994\\" staring me in the face.  1994?  This book... this lovely free-flowing book about leaving \\"civilized\\" society to accept the world on your own terms... this was written in the 1990s?  Well there you have it.  I made the ridiculous assumption that this tale simply was a part of a larger social upheaval when, in fact, it was a small rebellion in and of itself.  My bad.  My bad.<br /><br />In this story Mountain Girl has called a meeting of the members of her family.  She lives with her mom, dad, and brother in a home outskirting cliffs, canyons, deserts, and mountains, and it has just occurred to her that they are by no means rich.  To make her case, Mountain Girl insists that the family recognize that they are seriously lacking in funds.  They own a beat up old truck, wear clothing that's patched, and eat at a table that was constructed out of lumber someone else threw away.  Says Morning Girl, \\"Understand, I like this table fine.  All I'm saying is, you can tell it didn't come from a furniture store\\".  She insists that her parents consider getting better paying jobs, possibly in an office building.  To prove to their daughter that they are far richer than she may think, they ask her to calculate the price it's worth to work outdoors, say $20,000.  Then she adds another $30,000 for the sound of coyotes howling in the hills.  That doesn't even include the price of seeing the changing colors on the faraway mountains, or the color of a cactus bloom, or even the beauty of living amongst day and night birds at all times.  By the time Morning Girl considers it all, actual money seems to have become a lot less important, and she joins her family for a walk to find the sliver of the new moon in the sky.  She pats the table, and the reader comes to understand the title of the book a little better by the end.<br /><br />Oh it's hippy-dippy all right.  No question.  But the book is far more practical and spiritual than your run-of-the-mill \\"love all living creatures\\" picture books out there.  First of all, the main character is only called Mountain Girl because that's the nickname her parents gave her.  When she was born they lifted her to the sky just eight minutes after her birth to view the sunrise on the mountainside.  You can guess why her brother's nicknamed Ocean Boy.  Any practical person reading this story will certainly sympathize with Mountain Girl's attempts to talk some sense into her parents too.  While she's talking about practical financial matters (think of her as Alec on \\"Family Ties\\") her parents are talking about practical soulful matters.  They certainly don't starve and their lives are just as they would want them to be, a fact that initially eludes their eldest daughter.  What the book is truly asking is, what price freedom?  When do you stop worrying about things that don't matter and grab a hold of the things that really do?<br /><br />Accompanying this message (one that I think kids have an easier a time of understanding than their parents) are artist Peter Parnall's gorgeous illustrations.  Using a fascinating combination of fine line pens and bright vivid watercolors, each picture in this tale is an intricate decision of what to and what not to fill in.  The delicate line work here creates rocky craggy cliffs and deep swirling ocean depths.  Here, an illustration accompanying text describing the beauty of cactus blooms shows a pair of hovering brown eyes with the barest of outlines creating the impression of hair.  In the foreground, a perfectly rendered flower opens up to the opposite page's warming sun.  You can find hidden pictures of horses here, or luminous mountain shadows that change from aquamarine to deep forest green.  Parnall is intelligent enought to know that the grandeur of nature can only be truly hinted at on the page.  Therefore, these are pictures that show snatches of breathtaking beauty in every scene.  Every white space here is just as important as every color and shade.<br /><br />There are people who will pick up this book, scoff at its message (without reading it) and degrade its content sight unseen.  There are also people who will read it all the way through and find themselves uncomfortable with its presentation and message.  Then there are those who truly believe what the book is saying.  They will understand what it teaches, what it implies, and what it means to those kids who read (or are read) it.  For them, this book will find its way into their hearts.  Even if you don't like it, you must concede its beauty.  I suggest you find yourself a copy and snuggle down for a fascinating read.  You may be surprised at your own responses.geous illustrations.

608245:US	49148452	R20PEY3V5TSGTF	0688841775	369565652	A Treeful of Pigs	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Pigs in space	I like to begin some of my reviews with heartfelt confessions.  It's what I do.  Now, I'm going to admit right here and now that my very first impressions of this book come from the tender age of five.  When I was a child my mother would read this story to me quite regularly.  It was, undoubtedly, one of her favorites.  She would give each and every character (of which there are two) special voices and cadences for each and every line.  The fact of the matter?  The book did nothing for me.  I liked it okay.  There were the funny pigs (perpetually amused in any and all situations) and bright colorful characters.  I liked the farmer's wife outwitting her lazy husband too but as favorite books went I much preferred my Steven Kellogg or my \\"Ultra Violet Catastrophe\\".  So in mid-2004 I have returned to this book that once elicited from me the childhood equivalent of a shrug.  I picked it up, read it through once, read it through twice and came to an unavoidable conclusion:  It hasn't changed.  Or rather, I haven't.  This is a beautiful book, no question, with hundreds of tiny things to love and enjoy.  It just doesn't make my tiny heart go pitter-pat in the least.<br /><br />Once, as the story relates, there was a lazy farmer and his wife.  One day, the man decides to buy about a dozen pigs.  The wife worries that such pigs will be too much work, but the husband assures her that they'll raise them together.  The next day, however, the man refuses to get out of bed.  When the wife asks when he'll be getting up he responds, \\"On the day that pigs bloom in the garden like flowers.  On that day I will help you plant the corn\\".  That very next day the man goes to his window to find all one dozen pigs blooming in the garden.  This doesn't faze him much so he goes back to bed.  As time goes by the wife has more and more jobs that need to be done and the husband comes up with even loonier reasons for not helping.  Sometimes he'll help when pigs grow in the trees (which they do thanks to a little rope).  Or he'll get up when they fall from the sky like rain (some cushiony straw helps with that trick).  When the husband finally just wishes they'd disappear altogether, the next day finds him shocked to see they're all gone.  With that, the husband is told by his wife that the only way she'll help him look for the pigs is when he jumps out of bed, dresses, and promises never to be lazy again.  He does so (showing far more of his rear than you'd ever really want to see) and lo and behold the pigs spring out of the root cellar.  From that time onward he was never lazy again.<br /><br />It's a cute story, no question, but such an odd one.  Little questions arise in my mind... why did he care that the pigs disappeared when he hardly gave them a second glance?  Why the gratuitous butt shot?  Why did the wife keep doing silly things with the pigs when he obviously wasn't moved by the crazy pig stunts?  The pigs are especially cute here, and it is a relief to see them smiling cannily in each and every situation.  The husband and wife team that wrote and illustrated this book (Arnold and Anita Lobel) are to be commended for their entirely new fable.  Just the same, the book lacks that little something extra that keeps you coming back for more.  I speak from a bias that is roughly two decades old, so you'll probably find I'm wrong.  Just the same, I do recommend that you seek out this story and read it for yourself.  You may just find it's exactly what you've been seeking all along.  Plus, cute pigs.s to a little rope).

Just the same, the book lacks that little something extra that keeps you coming back for more.  I speak from a bias that is roughly two decades old, so you'll probably find I'm wrong.  Just the same, I do recommend that you seek out this story and read it for yourself.  You may just find it's exactly what you've been seeking all along.  Plus, cute pigs.	2004-07-01

Oh, It's Me: 50 Mortifying Situations And How to Deal	Books	2	2	3	N	N	Maybe Tucker Shaw is a pen name	All hail the Alloy Books. Yes, thanks to the Alloy, Inc. Company (the fine group that brought you such memorable titles as &quot;this book is about sex&quot; and &quot;My Mom Reads My E-mail, A Loser's Trying To Hook Up With Me, I Just Kissed My Best Friend's Boyfriend, And My Life Basically Sucks...Any Advice?&quot;) comes the newest l'il ole teen advice book to hit the market. Of course, like its fellow Alloy brethren, &quot;What's That Smell&quot; has the fine distinction of being written by an adult in a teen-like voice. This is alternately painful and downright hilarious depending on what kind of mood you're in when you read it. Though much of this book is simply info aimed at white suburban kids with comfortable lives, slices of actual honest-to-god useful facts sometimes manage weasel through the treacle and slang. Though I was less than impressed (in spite of the fact that I knew perfectly well what I was getting into when I picked up the publication) in the end this tale is just another collection of goody two shoe messages masquerading as a naughty advice book.<br /><br />The publication begins by clearly stating that this is NOT a self-help book. Author Tucker Shaw claims that this book was not written to, &quot;teach you how to feel good about yourself, how to make the most of your future, and how to get and keep friends&quot;. And here we find the first, but not the last, of Mr. Shaw's many lies. This is, in fact, EXACTLY what this book strives to do in between tales of parents, puberty, and parties (gone awry). Each chapter is one of fifty mortifying situations and the different ways in which a person can get out of them. As the book itself admits, the situations discussed here are strictly PG-13. Therefore, you may find information on how to handle a situation in which you're caught shoplifting or your parent finds your birth control, but you will not locate situations in which people are caught in compromising situations or what to do when your parents find your bong. In fact, the book actively advises the reader on some situations in a tone that verges on the preachy. Teens (and I tend to agree with this, but I think any kid who reads this book should know what the text boils down to) should not drink, or smoke, or do drugs, or shoplift, or pleasure themselves in their cars.<br />Now, the sad thing about this book, to my mind, is its publication date. Observe. Though it came out in 2003, &quot;What's That Smell&quot; has already become dated less than year after its original publication. This is entirely due to its bizarre belief that NSYNC is cool. I kid you not. There were at least 2 instances within the text of NSYNC being mentioned with the word, &quot;Sucks&quot; or its equivalent never coming up. Look, I'll level with you. I am not a teen. I'm 26 years old, dangerously nearing the old fogy period of my life and even I know that NSYNC are, at this point in time, ranked in coolness somewhere above Bananaramma and somewhere below potato soup. Then there's the problem I mentioned earlier concerning slang. Tucker Shaw (who I suspect probably remembers the Korean War for all that he thinks he's in touch with teens) uses the following terms in this book: ill, (as in, some consequences are going to be &quot;ill&quot;), mad guts, your 'hood, and (believe it or not) psych. I especially liked the portion on getting arrested. Apparently, the only situation in which this would be acceptable is one in which you join a World Bank/human rights protest, &quot;notwithstanding the fact that you have no clue what the issues involved are&quot;, to attract the attention of an activist. Apparently the only time teens are politically active is when they're attempting to nab a mate. Huh? Which teens does Tucker know? I'm sorry, but give this age group a little more credit. Believe it or not, some teenagers really do care about world issues. Geesh...<br />In an especially odd move, the book attempts to be gender neutral (as wellas sexual preference neutral, which I appreciated). Therefore, all mentions of significant others are accompanied by roughly twenty him/hers. This can get old, real fast. The illustrations riddling the text have as many male characters in embarrassing situations as female characters, so well done there.<br />The book's good advice: Telling teens that their friends will be far more interested in their crushes than their significant others. Informing them that you should NEVER meet the person you met online (priceless info that I doubt they'll listen to). The portion on personal hygiene is on track, for the most part. And to give credit where credit is due the book does encourage going to college, not &quot;borrowing&quot; your parents' car, the aforementioned anti-smoking understanding, etc.<br />Am I asking too much of a book for teens? This isn't exactly deep literature here, and the author wrote with an appropriately fluffy mindset from the start. Just the same, I think my real objections to &quot;What's That Smell?&quot; have to do with how stupid the book seems to think teens really are. First of all, within one year, half the slang written here will be outdated or indecipherable. Second of all, it seems to think that all teens (at least the ones purchasing books like this) are politically idiotic, vengeful, shallow-brained members of the high school elite. Aside from giving the more intelligent kids a complex, it's just a poor way to write a book. But what am I saying? Why should I complain? In no time at all books like this one will litter the dumpsters and dusty corners of bedrooms without a second thought. I suggest you skip giving this text a first thought as well.sexual preference neutral, which I appreciated). Therefore, all mentions of significant others are accompanied by roughly twenty him/hers.

608529:US	49148452	R2T08MAE55FGLC	0140504419	49896232	Ox-Cart Man	Books	5	69	70	N	N	Have you seen, the Ox-Cart Man, the Ox-Cart Man...	Most books that focus on continuity and the circle of life/the seasons/etc. like to concentrate on that theme via animals munching on other animals.  We sometimes forget that there are subtler ways to present this same theme.  Consider the lovely \\"Ox-Cart Man\\" by Donald Hall.  A 1980 Caldecott Award winner, the tale focuses on the yearly passage of one man selling his goods only to do it all over again the next year.  Ultimately this is one of the most comforting books out there.<br /><br />The book takes place in what looks to be the mid 19th century.  A man that is never named lives on a farm with his wife, daughter, and son.  The book begins with the family packing his cart with the various goods they have to sell.  There are mittens knit by his daughter, shawls spun and woven by his wife, and birch brooms carved by his son.  The book catalogues the items packed away in an oddly riveting fashion.  Next, the man travels on foot to a harbor town named Portsmouth.  There, he sells the items including his beloved ox.  There's a shot of the man kissing his ox good-bye on the nose, which (when you consider the slime factor) is simultaneously touching and gross.  He next goes out and buys an iron kettle, an embroidery needle for his daughter, a knife for his son, and two pounds of wintergreen peppermint candies.  The man walks home to his family waiting for him and as the seasons pass they build up their items to sell once more.  One of my favorite lines is the last one.  \\"And geese squawked in the barnyard, dropping feathers as soft as clouds\\".<br /><br />Those people who follow poetry will recognize the name Donald Hall and appreciate the simplicity of his writing in this book.  I loved that it began without explaining or pausing, immediately launching into a description of the man loading up his cart.  When adult writers or poets write for children, they usually haven't a clue how to go about it (paging Madonna...).  Mr. Hall does not suffer from this dilemma.  He knows exactly how to make a book that could have been dry and dull, fascinating.  Therefore, he uses the repetition of lines to catch the ears of kids.  There's an entire page in this book that contains ten lines all beginning with the words, \\"He sold\\".  I'm both old and young enough to remember when \\"Ox-Cart Man\\" was read on Reading Rainbow (one of the very few Caldecott winners to appear on that show) and even as a kid I loved the words in this story.  I assure you that this book, for whatever other flaws you may chose to find in it, is not boring in the least.<br /><br />I was especially taken with the illustrations in this book as well.  Illustrator Barbara Cooney is no stranger to Caldecott medals.  Having already illustrated the magnificent (and I highly recommend it) \\"Chanticleer and the Fox\\", her award count is higher than most.  For this book, Cooney adopted a style that has a great many similarities to the kinds of outsider art created during the 19th century.  The characters in this book have a kind of purposely flat presence on the page.  At the same time, Cooney hasn't sacrificed perspective or the illusion of distance in these prints.  Each page is both beautiful and simple, matching the text word for word with appropriate pictures.  If the book says that there were turnips, cabbages, a wooden box of maple sugar, and potatoes then by gum you're going to see every single one of those objects on the opposing page.  As a kid, I'd always be disturbed by picture books where the words failed to match the text.  Here I have no such fears.<br /><br />Some picture books are filled with bright snazzy flash-in-the pan illustrations and narratives that will date themselves in ten years or less.  Others are quiet simple offerings that display beauty as well as a kind of central integrity.  \\"Ox-Cart Man\\" is in the latter category.  This is a book that will be loved for decades and that will only grow more precious in the eyes of children as the years go on.  For a funpairing, try reading it to your kiddies with \\"Swamp Angel\\", by Anne Isaacs.  Books like this one should be treasured.  Fortunately, I think this one already is.try reading it to your kiddies with \\"Swamp Angel\\", by Anne Isaacs.  Books like this one should be treasured.

Author Caralyn Buehner and her husband Mark Buehner (the book's illustrator) woke one morning to find that the snowman they'd created the night before had surreptitiously moved several yards closer to their front door.  Inspired by their snow creature's apparent desire to move around and about, the Buehners started speculating on the eventide activities of snowmen in general.  The result is the lovely and ludicrous \\"Snowmen At Night\\".<br /><br />As the young boy narrator tells it, one day he made a snowman with coal eyes and mouth and a carrot nose.  The next day he returned to his fine creation only to find it looking all saggy baggy.  This causes the boy to speculate, \\"What do snowmen do at night?\\".  The answer is clear.  Snowmen like to go to the park drinking ice-cold cocoa made by (and here it gets a little odd) \\"snowman mothers\\".  Hm.  Then they start to participate in their own very particular games.  These include races, skating on the frozen ponds, making snow angels, and having fabulous snow fights.  There's even some big time sledding down monstrous (but not too scary) hills.  Towards the end, you really can't blame the snowmen if they've lost an eye here or a mitten there.  Maybe they look a little bit worse for wear by the morning's light, but rest assured that they've definitely had a good time while you slept.<br /><br />It's difficult for a person of my generation to read a snowman book and not instantly think of old \\"Calvin and Hobbes\\" cartoons.  The snowmen pictured here are actually not too different from the ones pictured in Bill Watterson's strips, but they're significantly less scary.  I think you'll instantly gravitate to this book the minute you see the cover.  On the top half stand the serene smiling snowmen in the bright noonday sun.  On the bottom half they're cavorting in a kind of makeshift conga line.  Kids will warm to the idea of snowmen (something they themselves have created) having lives entirely of their own.  It doesn't hurt any that the guys definitely seem to be having the time of their lives.  Caralyn's text is well complimented by Mark's illustrations too.  There's even been the extra added element of hidden shapes for kids to find in the pictures.  If readers look carefully they might be able to spot a cat, a rabbit, a Santa face, and more.  I appreciated that these images never once drew inordinate attention to themselves or distracted from the pictures.  That is the mark of an expert illustrator.<br /><br />The back flap of the book shows a photograph of the rogue snowman that inspired this book in the first place.  The book isn't the most original in the world and its illustrations aren't going to blow you away with either their wit or their artistic merits but it's certainly a great wintertime tale.  There are five million books about toys coming to life at night, so why not snowmen too?  If you want a picture book that takes away the sting of snowmen melting, I suggest you definitely check out and read the jaunty flouncy \\"Snowmen At Night\\" and read it to your loved ones.

610517:US	49148452	R2L86BWFBCMEYL	1568461895	46085486	Rose Blanche	Books	5	39	39	N	N	Rose Blanche, you are not alone	Congratulations! You have successfully located the best translation of the book &quot;Rose Blanche&quot; available on the market today. While the British and German translations may change significant portions of this tale around and about, the American version (all thanks to hard work of excellent translators Martha Coventry and Richard Graglia) is true to authors Gallaz and Innocenti's original plot and vision. So well done you! Give yourself a pat on the back and a hanky. You'll need it after you finish reading the book.<br /><br />It's Germany during World War II. As we watch, our little heroine, Rose Blanche, describes the early days of the war. The soldiers are being packed up and shipped away and everyone is cheering them on. Swastikas are plentiful. One day, Rose sees a small boy escape from a van in the middle of the street. The boy is quickly caught and placed within the cramped van once again. Curious, Rose Blanche follows the van to the edge of town and into the forest. There she comes face to face with the children of a concentration camp. After offering them some of her food, the first person narrative abruptly begins to be told in the third person instead. We are told that Rose Blanche continued to bring food to the hungry children. Finally, the citizens of the town flee, wounded soldiers amongst them. Rather than escaping, Rose Blanche makes one last trip to the camp, only to find it empty. A single shot rings out and we see the Communist soldiers filling the now abandoned town. The book ends with, &quot;Rose Blanche's mother waited a long time for her little girl&quot;. Flowers bloom, but the single purple bloom the girl placed on the barbed wire has wilted.<br /><br />Tragedy in the key of E. The text is rather well written, giving no specific person or persons blame, but rather suggesting a collective guilt. Admittedly, I was a little taken aback by the sudden switch in narrative. One minute you know exactly what Rose Blanche is thinking and the next you can only interpret her emotions through descriptions and visual images. A review of this book in the March 2004 issue of &quot;Children's Literature in Education&quot; suggested that this is done so that the reader is given a bit of distance when the girl is shot. Admittedly, I don't expect my heroines to die in the picture books I read but I think we can chalk that up to naivete on my part more than anything else. This is, after all, an incredibly realistic work of fiction. The character of Rose Blanche even attains a kind of religious piousness at the end of the tale. In her final picture, she stands in the position of a saint. Her eyes are downcast, one hand lightly touching her heart, and the other placing a small purple flower on the broken fence.<br /><br />Which brings us to the illustrations. Innocenti's pictures deftly tell a story within the actual text. In the first few pictures, Rose appears in happy crowd scenes. Then, as she discovers more about the world in which she lives, she is placed farther and farther away from other people. Rose is continually set apart from the others by her clothing as well. Where everyone else is resigned to grays and browns, Rose sports a pink dress with a bright red bow on her head. The illustrations are strikingly realistic, never becoming cartoony or visually inconsistent. Innocenti is deft at the millions of different ways in which light changes a scene. And to top it all off, he's done some of the most brilliant fog I've ever seen put down on paper.<br /><br />This is a book about seeing what other people won't. The name &quot;Rose Blanche&quot; is explained by the author on the book flap. The Rose Blanche was a group of young Germans that protested the war. Like the heroine of this tale, they were unduly executed for the crime of thinking differently. The best use of this book is to utilize it in such a way that we can never forget how important it is to question authority at all times and to always fight forthe truth. It seems that message is more important today than ever. A tip of the hat to the Rose Blanches of the world.t seems that message is more important today than ever.

Authors (especially authors of children's books) love reinterpreting old folk and fairy tales.  From \\"The Stinky Cheese Man\\" to \\"East\\", children are constantly being exposed to a wide variety of new ways of reading and interpreting the tales they heard when younger.  Patricia Polacco is to be commended for her particularly original reinterpretation.  Some of you may be familiar with the classic Baba Yaga stories that came out of Russia.  These stories centered on an evil old woman who lived in a house that stood on chicken legs.  Usually portrayed as a wicked witch, Baba Yaga ate children and cavorted with the darkest of magics.  In \\"Babushka Baba Yaga\\", Polacco reclaims a newly misunderstood icon.<br /><br />Unlike the stories, the Baba Yaga in this tale is the last of her kind.  Terribly lonely in her forest home, she spends the days enviously spying on the grandmothers (or \\"babushkas\\") of the nearby village.  There is nothing Baba Yaga would like more than to care for a little young creature of her own.  One day she has the idea of borrowing some babushka clothing and arriving in the village as an old woman.  It isn't long before she meets Natasha and her little son Victor.  Victor has no babushka of his own, and Baba Yaga offers to take care of the boy, cook, and clean in exhange for a bed and some food.  Things go swimmingly for quite a while.  Then, one day, Victor and his new babushka overhear a chilling Baba Yaga tale and the boy is greatly scared.  Not wanting to cause any trouble, Baba Yaga leaves the happy home with great sorrow.  It's only through a miraculous rescue and the villagers' acceptance that things are finally put to rights at the end.<br /><br />The moral of the story is spoken by one of the village women at the book's finish.  \\"Those who judge one another on what they hear or see, and not on what they know of them in their hearts, are fools indeed!\\"  I especially ask that you consider the book's final picture.  There, Baba Yaga hugs a happy Victor, his chubby hands clutching her and wiping his face.  Polacco has always excelled at books that make adult readers cry.  I have no doubts at all that this story falls squarely into that category.  After all, this is a tale about gaining the love of little children, regardless of age or background.  The text is especially clever and is well accompanied by Polacco's clever illustrations.  If you're not partial to Polacco pictures then I'm certain you won't much care for this book.  If, on the other hand, you are charmed by her sometimes slapdash sometimes intricately shaded pictures you'll be in seventh heaven.  Faces are her forte, and in the book Baba Yaga is lined and creased, as are the faces of all the older women in the village.  There is tenderness found in these people, and it comes as much from their actions as from their gently rounded cheeks.<br /><br />\\"Babushka Baba Yaga\\" embraces the idea of the \\"true\\" Baba Yaga.  When reading scary folktales, consider adding this book to your repertoire.  It successfully combines the old and the young with the ancient and the post-modern.

I once heard a rumor that the Dr. Seuss book &quot;Marvin K. Mooney Will You Please Go Now!&quot; was written by the author as a kind of plea to President Nixon. Written around the time of the Watergate scandals, the rumor I heard stated that the book (a delightful collection of different ways in which Marvin K. Mooney may leave) was a cry that the President should step down and (in the words of the book), &quot;Just go, go, GO!&quot;. Reading the story today, I wish I could say that this rumor is unequivocally undeniable, but I can't. The Marvin K. Mooney in this book doesn't look a thing like our dear departed President. If you want a picture book representation of Nixon, I suggest you locate, &quot;The Boy Who Looked Like Lincoln&quot;. Otherwise, read this story solely for its enjoyable plot.<br /><br />There are approximately two characters in this tale. One is the aforementioned Mr. Mooney who stands in purple pajamas upon a circular floor rug. The other character is an unseen narrator who appears only as a pair of hands and arms. These hands proceed to point to a watch, point out the door, and gesture in a variety of different ways as to how best Marvin K. Mooney could go. For quite some time Marvin doesn't budge, and we are treated to various hypothetical images of him leaving ala the mail, by cow, on a Bumble-Boat, or even (my personal favorite) by camel in a bureau drawer. I don't want to give away the ending so I'll just say that the narrator is a persuasive fellow.<br /><br />The book's not, perhaps, the best known of the Seussian repertoire. And, admittedly, it's not his best. Still, there's something innately amusing about trying to convince a fellow that he should leave posthaste without giving much in a way of a reason. The illogical logic of this picture book, accompanied by Seuss's lilting cadences, is great. There are plenty of better Dr. Seuss books out there, but I think that there may be some people in the world who grew up with &quot;Marvin K. Mooney Will You Please Go Now!&quot; and will love it just as much today as they ever did. It's good clean fun, simultaneously crazy and lovely. A real treat.y Will You Please Go Now!&quot; and will love it just as much today as they ever did. It's good clean fun, simultaneously crazy and lovely. A real treat.	2004-06-28

In these stories the female protagonists usually either have super powers or were born as magical semi-human beings. &quot;The Keeper of the Isis Light&quot; is a little different than partly because the main character spends much of the book in a complete fog about her life, her capabilities, and who she truly is. The book is as much about overcoming the prejudices of others as it is about the meaning of happiness and its importance. If you're looking for a book that explores deep emotional and spiritual issues in a sci-fi context, I think you've found your match.<br /><br /> Olwen Pendennis was born on the planet Isis ten years ago (sixteen by Earth's sun). Living alone with only her faithful companion Guardian to keep her company, Olwen leads a rich and exciting life on her planet's surface. As the official Keeper of the Isis Light, Olwen's job is to maintain the signal that radios information about Isis's surface to Earth for future colonists. When these settlers appear one day, Olwen finds her world strangely shaken. Guardian has done his best to keep Olwen safe and happy while living on Isis, but now she must deal with other people and all the good and bad things humans can do. Through it all, Olwen discovers truths about herself and her own inner strength and abilities that she might never have found while living contentedly on her own. In the end, the reader is left wondering whether or not it's a good thing Olwen met with these colonists and, if good, how.<br /><br /> I was incredibly disappointed that the book flap accompanying this little novella gave away too many of the book's delightful secrets. My advice to you if you want to read this story is to go into it blind. Don't read any more of the synopsis than the one I've given you above. It'll only ruin the surprises that dot this intricate book. There are many things to love here as well. The plot is tight and well formed. Olwen never questions her happy existence until the moment that things begin to change. In many ways she's like Miranda in &quot;The Tempest&quot;. In others, she's Caliban. Author Monica Hughes is particularly good as conjuring up a visual sense of the Isis landscape. In this story you see the planet as the heroine does and you regret (as she does) that settlers have arrived to muck it up. I also loved the Guardian in this tale. A character that professes to not feel emotions, he often belies this idea by growing agitated, touched, or worried at key moments.<br /><br /> Now for my favorite part of any review. The flaws! Actually, there aren't many to complain about in this book. Originally published in 1980, &quot;The Keeper of the Isis Light&quot; suffers from a few pre-P.C. terms. A black child, for example, is referred to as &quot;negroid&quot; at one point. Later, that same child (though supposedly nine years of age) acts far more like a six year old. Thus ends my summary of all flaws this book contains. As you can see, they're few in number.<br /><br /> Great science fiction books use metaphors and grandiose plots to discuss universal ideas. In many ways, &quot;The Keeper of the Isis Light&quot; is very similar to the great Sylvia Engdahl book, &quot;Enchantress From the Stars&quot;. Both books talk about prejudice and feature incredibly strong female characters. In this book, however, there are some uniquely emotional moments.

A book that will be well remembered for years to come (I hope).existence until the moment that things begin to change. In many ways she's like Miranda in &quot;The Tempest&quot;. In others, she's Caliban. Author Monica Hughes is particularly good as conjuring up a visual sense of the Isis landscape. In this story you see the planet as the heroine does and you regret (as she does) that settlers have arrived to muck it up. I also loved the Guardian in this tale. A character that professes to not feel emotions, he often belies this idea by growing agitated, touched, or worried at key moments.      Now for my favorite part of any review. The flaws! Actually, there aren't many to complain about in this book. Originally published in 1980, &quot;The Keeper of the Isis Light&quot; suffers from a few pre-P.C. terms. A black child, for example, is referred to as &quot;negroid&quot; at one point. Later, that same child (though supposedly nine years of age) acts far more like a six year old. Thus ends my summary of all flaws this book contains. As you can see, they're few in number.      Great science fiction books use metaphors and grandiose plots to discuss universal ideas. In many ways, &quot;The Keeper of the Isis Light&quot; is very similar to the great Sylvia Engdahl book, &quot;Enchantress From the Stars&quot;. Both books talk about prejudice and feature incredibly strong female characters. In this book, however, there are some uniquely emotional moments. The story is written in a crisp approachable style that will never go out of date. If you've a kid interested in sci-fi or just wants a low key introduction to it, this book is the perfect offering. A book that will be well remembered for years to come (I hope).	2004-06-28

They have that extra little spark or oomph that sets them apart from the rest.  At first, the idea of a modern illustrator reworking a cautionary tale from 1829 sounds as if it's in danger of becoming dull, preachy, or didactic.  Then you take a single glance at Tony DiTerlizzi's reworking of Mary Howitt's poem, \\"The Spider and the Fly\\", and you're blown away.  Referencing the silent films of the 1920s and 30s, the book is meant to guide youngsters on the path of wisdom.  Presumably by showing the stupidity of flies.<br /><br />We all know the great opening lines of this tale.  \\" `Will you walk into my parlor?' said the Spider to the Fly\\".  Here we see our villain, the gorgeously outfitted spider, bowing deeply to a lovely lady fly that bears no little resemblance to Shelly Duvall.  The spider himself is replete with walking cane, spats on each of his legs, slick dandified hair, a Rhett Butler moustache, and a long top hat.  The fly's initial answer (a negative) shows her in her best flapper wear.  She has the parasol, the delicately gloved arms, the handbag, bobbed antennae, and flapper hat.  The spider is persistent, now donning a smoking jacket and fez as various buggy ghosts of his past victims attempt to warn the little fly away.  Finally, after many attempts, the spider flatters the fly with tales of her beauty.  She falls for it instantly and returns when the spider calls, \\"Your robes are green and purple - there's a crest upon your head; Your eyes are like the diamond bright, but mine are dull as lead\\".  She comes, he pops her in his long hat, and the next thing we know she's tied up tight in a cocoon with the shadow of a spider (cook's hat on head, knife and fork in hand) laughingly approach her.  The moral of the story is, as William Bennett once said, \\"Not everyone who talks sweetly offers sweets\\".<br /><br />It's not every picture book that the villain not only wins but also gets his own especial afterword.  NOT written by Mary Howitt, the spider has his say.  He points out that all spiders are trappers, even the beloved Charlotte from E.B. White's classic book.  As we read we see the now full spider, his spatted feet on the table, delicately wiping his mouth on his napkin.  A little hat sits forlornly on the plate before him.  Thus ends a truly delightful book.  DiTerlizzi has taken the time to include a couple facts about the life of the author Howitt, which is great.  As an illustrator, the black and white scheme used for these illustrations is marvelous.  These pictures were rendered beautifully and each shot is cinematic.  There is little doubt, certainly, that some children will be perturbed by the pretty little fly's untimely end.  I might point out, however, that there are also some children out there that are perturbed by the death of Charlotte in the aforementioned, \\"Charlotte's Web\\".  Most kids, I believe, will love this book.  It's noteworthy to point out that the blurbs on the back of the book come from Henry Selick (director of the \\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\") and Lance Smith (of \\"The Stinky Cheese Man\\" fame).  Both of these should give you a fair idea of the kind of book this is.  It's dark without ever becoming gory.  Intense without ever being graphic.  And, most importantly of all, it's a joy to look at.  Who knew 19th century poems could be so much fun?y Mary Howitt, the spider has his say.

After all, the cover sports the image of a small boy walking proudly in the jungle as a pair of giant tiger's paws frame the image.  As it happens, this book is NOT that kind of a story.  Though it does contain the idea of a boy facing down a hungry tiger, this book is meant as a kind of answer to the old Blake poem \\"The Tiger\\".  Where the poem asks, \\"Tiger! Tiger! burning bright/ In the forests of the night/ What immortal hand or eye/ Could frame thy fearful symmetry?\\"  the book answers that the hand and eye belong to none other than a small boy.<br /><br />Pocu lives in a small village in country that is never named.  We'll say it's India.  One day everyone in town is sleepy because it is such a hot day.  Left on his own to wander the jungle, Pocu finds a beautiful feather.  When he flicks it one way, the air grows cooler.  When he flicks it another the flowers bloom and a large shadow appears.  This shadow coaxes the boy to create more parts of it.  It wants eyes to see with, paws to follow Pocu with, a body that can be stroked, a tail to stir the air, and finally gorgeous black stripes.  It may be no surprise to the reader, but Pocu is a little shocked when he finds himself facing a fully-grown tiger.  In his huge state the tiger demands to be taken back to Pocu's village, \\"in time for supper\\".  At first Pocu leads him back, but with a swish of the feather, the tiger problem is taken care of a piece at a time.  Pocu leaves the feather in the wood once more, returns to his family, \\"and he was just I time for supper\\".<br /><br />Reading it now, I noticed that the last line of this picture book is not dissimilar to the last line in Maurice Sendak's, \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\".  Still, this book is less about taming wild things than refusing to be tamed by them.  As the book flap describes this tale it, \\"shows readers the power of imagination and the way in which it can take on a life of its own\\".  Author Dee Lillegard is adept at writing a story in which the action slowly builds.  As the tiger grows more and more impatient and hungry, the monkeys and parrots scream louder and louder.  Accompanying the text are illustrations by the accomplished Susan Guevara.  Better known, perhaps, for her eclectic and stunning Chato books (if you haven't read it, I demand you run out and purchase \\"Chato and the Party Animals\\", NOW!), Guevara has toned down her style for this particular book.  Certainly she is just as enamored with color now as she has ever been.  The magical feather that Pocu employs is like that of a peacock but riddled with additional yellows, oranges, pinks, greens, purples, reds, aquamarines, etc.  It's one heckuva fancy feather.  But as a result of this less than electric drawing technique, the book feels a little subdued.  This is not on the level with her other work, but its still a lovely book.<br /><br />There's much to enjoy about a story in which the main character is initially told to bug off at the beginning, has an adventure, and then comes home to a welcoming family.  This is a comforting picture book, and a pretty one to look at as well.  It may be difficult to write wholly new fables, but I think Lillegard and Guevara have admirably penned a great story.

There are plenty of tales in which a young girl bonds with a very special horse. This is the rare book in which the girl not only bonds with a horse but, in the end, becomes one herself (as well as that horse's mate). Paul Goble made quite a career out of telling Native American folktales in picture book form. In this particular story, a girl's love for four-legged beasts is taken to its logical extreme.<br /><br /> In this book, a girl once cared for her tribe's horses during the day. She would water them and find them places to feed. One day, a storm rose while the girl slept and the horses grazed. In a panic, the animals began to stampede away, and it was only by her skill that the girl was able to climb aboard one. When at last they stopped, the girl met the leader of all the wild horses, a beautiful spotted stallion. The girl continued to live with the creatures until one day she was successfully captured by members of her own tribe. She was happy to see her parents once more, but begged to return to the horses. The tribe agreed and each year she would return briefly to give the people a new colt. When she didn't return one year, riders swore that they saw a black mare that greatly resembled the girl, now the mate of the spotted stallion. The book ends with a Navaho's song about his horse and Black Elk (an Oglala Sioux)?s dream about a stallion's song.<br /><br /> I was a little shocked that this tale never identified the tribe to which the girl belonged. Since, however, this is an original story and not a retelling of a classic Native American tale (or so the book would lead you to believe) I wasn't too perturbed by the omission. After all, when people tell stories about themselves, they rarely identify their nationality or allegiance. In this book, the girl's tribe is referred to simply as &quot;the people&quot;. If you've ever seen a Paul Goble book before, you know what to expect when you read this. His characters are fairly featureless, though as an artist he spends a significant bit of time detailing their clothing, hair, weapons, homes, etc. He expresses a great love of color in all his pictures, and it's quite enjoyable to flip through the shots of multicolored horses. In its construction, this book is incredibly lovely. But the question that came to my mind while reading it was, how interesting will children find this tale? For those kids obsessed by horses, I think this book will go over like gangbusters. After all, as horse-love goes, this girl is an extreme example. In other ways, the book is a bit dull. When you illustrate a tale in which emotions are not visible on the characters, you're going to lose those readers that like seeing happy and sad expressions. It's a style choice on the part of the author/illustrator and while I respect it I cannot wholly recommend it.<br /><br /> Just the same, it's a lovely book to flip through. Just know that it is an original Native American tale and not a retelling. For every child that has imagined running away and joining a band of wild animals, this is the perfect story to read.

A staple of humorous stories for years has been the idea of the oblivious protagonist. How many cartoons have you watched where the well meaning but bumbling hero comes within a hair's breath of death as some watchful soul (either someone who wants to hurt our hero or help them) accidentally falls into madcap trap after trap after trap? Tons. After all, it's funny stuff. Well &quot;Rosie's Walk&quot; ascribed to that idea way back in 1968 when it was first published. The tale of blithe Rosie and the doe eyed fox that wants to eat her is as old as the hills and still just as funny.<br /><br /> Rosie decides one day to go for a walk. As she does so a hungry fox gets wind of the plump little hen and decides to pounce upon her for his (her?) supper. Rosie takes no notice of this impending danger, and the book is simply a series of vignettes of chicken and fox locked in that eternal conflict of hunter and prey. The text, such as it is, is very simple. It never makes a single mention of the fox, choosing to only describe Rosie's walk. In fact, one could write the entire book out in a single sentence since there are only 32 words in total. It is a deceptively simple book.<br /><br /> So what makes this such a fabulous story? Well, what Pat Hutchins overdoes in brevity, she makes up for with some of the most elaborate pen and ink drawings I've seen in a long time. Rosie, for one, is a joy. Her expression never changes for a moment. This hen is oblivious to not only the fox, but also the world at large. She walks about with her eyes at half-mast wearing an expression of deep disinterest. If you happen to know a typical teenager, that teenager in chicken form would be Rosie. The fox, on the other hand, makes up for all the emotions that nonplussed Rosie lacks. This is a beautiful creature, sporting an elaborately illustrated body and soft melting eyes. It doesn't hurt that every picture in this book looks like it was fun for the author/illustrator to draw. Birds flying in the trees are a complex amalgamation of dots, patterns, and slinky black lines. Even the grasshoppers in the fields are elaborate combinations of circles and lines. Rosie's feathers alone are so well organized and detailed that I'd half like to frame her and put her up on my wall. And though the gags directed against the poor schlimazel of a fox are obvious, they're well executed. Hutchins has a wonderful sense of timing in this story. This book is truly a class act.

Able to lift strong policemen with her bare hands!  Capable of climbing tall houses and trees with virtually no effort at all!  Rescuing children from burning buildings and adults from snobby talk!  If, like myself, you were a child of the 1980s then your first exposure to Miss Longstocking probably came in the form of that gawdawful movie circa 1988.  Words alone cannot express the damage that film did to the youth of America.  After watching it I avoided the book \\"Pippi Longstocking\\" like it was the plague itself.  Only recently have I recanted and decided to read Astrid Lindgren's classic tale.  As charming as it is outright bizarre I charge all of you to take the time to find and devour this little Swedish gem.  Pippi's a pip, no question.<br /><br />Working at wish fulfillment on about ten different levels, Pippi is the ultimate kid's kid.  She lives all alone in a large fantastic house.  Her mother died while she was but a babe and her father has been lost at sea.  As optimistic regarding her father's return as Primrose Squarp in \\"Everything On a Waffle\\", Pippi fills her days with dancing, pancakes, and games.  She owns a whole suitcase of gold coins, which allow her the freedom to live alone and untended.  On top of that, she has her own monkey (the drolly named Mr. Nilsson) and horse.  The neighbor children Annika and Tommy think (rightly so) that Pippi's a wonder.  She never attends school or bothers with all the problems other children suffer.  Instead, she has her own unique perspective on life and the people around her.  Though precocious she's never mean, even when dealing with bullies or criminals.<br /><br />The book, originally published in American in 1950, is a wonder.  Though I'm certain other illustrators have done a fair job, I highly recommend that you seek out an edition illustrated by the talented Louis S. Glanzman.  His Pippi is just as fabulous as you might hope her to be.  I've always minded those Pippi's that seem a little too lanky or tough.  This Pippi is just mischief incarnate.  While you're out seeking an edition of this book illustrated by Glanzman, also make certain that the translation has been done by Florence Lamborn.  There were some moments of trans-atlantic interpretation that just blew me away.  For example, when confronted by evil bullies numerous in number, the biggest and meanest of them eyes Pippi and says, \\"boys, let Willie alone and take a look at this girl.  What a babe!\\".  Obviously that phrase must've meant something entirely different in 1950, but I was incredibly amused by it just the same.  Other funny moments caught my eye.  For one thing, Pippi and her friends are forever drinking coffee.  Not given the \\"adult drink\\" status it has in the states, coffee is definitely the drink of choice of Swedish youth.  And there was also the difficulty the translator had with verbal puns.  Some of these had to be worked around by explaining what a word means in English.  Without these explanations the book's jokes would fall flat.<br /><br />Finally, my favorite chapter of the book.  It was the chapter in which Pippi is invited to a fancy coffee party (see what I meant about kids and coffee?).  Pippi attempts desperately to mix and mingle appropriately with the middle-aged lady guests there.  When the women start putting down their hired help, Pippi is more than eager to tell multiple increasingly bizarre stories of her grandmother's servant Malin.  The ways in which Pippi tells Milan tales becomes more and more extreme until at the end she screams towards the women from the other end of the block, \\"SHE NEVER SWEPT UNDER THE BEDS\\".  I think you'll have to read the chapter yourself to see just how increasingly hilarious it becomes.  It's fabulous stuff.<br /><br />Every country has its resident red headed heroine.  Canada has Anne of Green Gables.  America has Caddie Woodlawn.  Sweden has Pippi Longstocking.  She's the greatest thing since sliced bread and twice as perky.  For a fabulous romp through the increasingly ridiculous, I more than recommend this quirky spunky fan-freakin'-tastic book.  It hasn't aged a jot.greatest thing since sliced bread and twice as perky.

There seems to be an insatiable need on the part of children to read about the mythical creatures that live within and yet not within our midst. Changelings are some of the oldest of these creatures and have been used to excellent use in a wide variety of literature. As you may know, a changeling is an object or creature exchanged for an unchristened baby. The changeling may at first look just like the baby it has replaced, but over time definite differences will come out. Most stories about changelings concentrate on the effort to locate the exchanged child. In the case of Eloise McGraw's, &quot;The Moorchild&quot;, the author has cleverly written a tale of what it means to be different from everyone around you.<br /><br /> Old Bess knows something has gone wrong with the baby Saaski. Where once the child was docile and contained, now it cries and screams continually day and night. Old Bess suspects, rightly, that her grandchild has been exchanged for a changeling, an idea her daughter and son-in-law won't even consider. For her own part, Saaski is livid. A fairy, yes, she has been ousted from her home and fellows for the crime of not being able to do simple fairy tricks. It turns out that she is half human, and belongs neither in the fairy world nor in the human. As the baby Saaski grows up, she forgets her former life in the mystical Mound and thinks of herself as fully human, if a little odd. Certainly the village distrusts her, a feeling that becomes far more malignant and violent as time goes on. On her own, Saaski only feels truly free when she can wander the Moors, piping a tune on her grandfather's bagpipes. As time goes by, however, Saaski must rediscover who she is and solve the mystery of the child she replaced.<br /><br /> On the surface, the tale is a straightforward look at how difference breeds unnecessary hatred. Delving a little deeper into the text, this is a story about biracial children and the prejudices they face in society. In her dedication McGraw writes, &quot;To all children who have ever felt different&quot;, giving her readers the chance to identify with this strange but beautiful creature. I was amazed at how well the author researched the classic fairy stories too. Saaski is afraid of salt, iron, rowan wood, St. John's Wart flowers, and other items as well. The fairies steal mostly food items and are lacking in such human emotions as love and hate. As a changeling, Saaski is similar to the boy Troy in Michael Chabon's recent fairy tale, &quot;Summerland&quot;. She bears little resemblance to dangerous or evil changelings found in tales like Maurice Sendak's, &quot;Outside Over There&quot;, (the melting baby changeling is particularly frightening) or the creature in John Crowley's, &quot;Little Big&quot; that crawls to the fireplace and starts eating the hot coals there like popcorn. The book is careful to admit that in some cases, changelings are enchanted sticks of wood or inanimate objects. Saaski's case is special because she is a halfling of sorts with a fairy mother and a human pa.<br /><br /> There are a lot of great fairy stories out there that don't give a whoopty-doo about the laws governing the Fair Folk and their kin. In a way, it's a great relief to read an accomplished writer like Eloise McGraw and her &quot;Moorchild&quot; book. The plot is enchanting, the characters lively and well written, and the story a fabulous metaphor for those people that must create their own worlds when the one around them becomes too intolerant.

A beautiful wonderful book of my youth.  You may remember author Margaret Mahy from her fabulous young adult novels like, \\"The Changeover\\" or \\"The Haunting\\".  You may remember illustrator Brian Froud from Terry Jones's delightfully twisted, &quot;Lady Cottington's Pressed Fairy Book&quot;.  Back in 1975, these two artists in their fields worked together to create a book accomplished the mighty task of appearing sweet without being horribly precious.  \\"Ultra-Violet Catastrophe!\\" (a term that, within context, actually makes a lot of sense) is about Sally.  Preferring to spend her days in trees as Horrible Stumper the tree pirate, Sally is forced to clean up and accompany her mother to Aunt Anne Pringle's house.  The idea does not appeal to Sally, especially since Aunt Anne is very fond of all things neat and tidy, including little girls.  It is fortunate, therefore, that when Sally arrives she finds that staying with Aunt Anne is none other than Great Uncle Magnus Pringle.  The two are told to go for a walk, and while doing so find that they have a lot in common.  Great-Uncle Magnus is a fan of burrowing into hedges, wading through muddy ponds, singing great silly songs, and building dams in streams.  While out and about the two bond over the man's favorite phrases including, \\"Ultra-Violet Catastrophe\\" (a response one has to being treated like a potted plant) and \\"Seismological Singularity\\".  After being chased by a mere cow (quoth Sally, \\"A cow with a calf isn't as mere as other cows, I don't think\\") and escaping over a barbed wire fence the two are, needless to say, a tad dirty/ripped to shreds/mud streaked.  They are placed on some newspapers to dry off and soon the two bid one another a fond farewell.  Great-Uncle Magnus invites Sally and her mother to visit him at the sea where he lives.  The final shot is of the large man waving goodbye, his trousers ripped in the most embarrassing of places.<br /><br />There's a wonderful tone and feel to this story.  Anyone looking for a lovely intergenerational tale about being yourself would do well to give this book a look-see.  And Mahy has such a fabulous way of describing things.  Some of the phrases that have stayed with me over the years include the sentence, \\"Her hair was brushed until it shone and her ears went all red and hot\\", and, \\"His voice was loud - loud but not crackly.  It was rather like guns at sea\\".  The accompanying illustrations by Brian Froud are wonderfully evocative.  The first shot of Sally shows her sitting on a tree branch, ankles crossed and her big thick head of hair surrounding her as she scowls.  The more you look at Sally the more sense it makes that this illustrator would later go on to create books of squashed fairies.  The country in which this takes place is never named, and you can't help but love seeing the fields, trees, rocks, and streams where the two wayward travelers do their exploring.<br /><br />Of all the forgotten and out-of-print picture books out there, this has to be one of the greatest.  A truly wonderful forgotten treasure, it deserves to be republished and brought to the attention of millions of children once more. If you find yourself lucky enough to own a copy, read it to the little ones you know every single day.  It'll do you both quite a lot of good.ng for a lovely intergenerational tale about being yourself would do well to give this book a look-see.  And Mahy has such a fabulous way of describing things.

This is the first book in the Series of Unfortunate Events that I really wish I had heard on tape.  Many parts of this tale should be heard spoken aloud to be truly appreciated.  As it was, I was resigned to instead reading the book while working out on a particularly nasty elliptical runner all the time pondering the sad fate of the Baudelaire orphans and their friends.  In \\"The Vile Village\\", the plot not only thickens but congeals.  Here at last are more clues about the mysterious VFD.  Here the name \\"Snicket\\" has arrived within the text of these pages rather than as merely its author and narrator.  Here the clues add up and up.<br /><br />Taking the phrase, \\"It takes a village to raise a child\\", a little too seriously, the Baudelaire orphans have now been officially adopted by none other than an entire village.  The orphans have chosen this particular location because of its fascinating name, VFD.  As you might recall, these initials were part of the Quagmire triplets' last cryptic words to the Baudelaires before they were officially kidnapped by the loathsome Count Olaf.  As it turns out, the town is actually named the Village of Fowl Devotees due to its enormous crow population.  While there, the orphans are required to do the chores for all the townspeople and live with the kindly handyman, Hector.  It isn't long before mysterious messages in the form of rhyming couplets start appearing, apparently from the Quagmires.  It's up to the Baudelaires to find their friends and save their own skin before an angry mob torches them forthwith.<br /><br />While the tension runs high in this particular Snicket outing, I found it strangely hopeful at the end.  Obviously this was not the author's intention, but that's how I felt anyway.  Though tensions run high in this tale, the angry mob is about as threatening as the witch hunters in \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\".  Personally I was delighted when I was able to figure out where the Quagmires were being hidden by page 143.  Then I remembered that I am currently 26 years of age and this book was written, ostensibly, for kids.  Still, I think I've also figured out what VFD stands for, and only time will show if I am right or wrong.<br /><br />The story itself is just as you would like it to be.  The orphans have a little more enjoyable down time here and (much to my relief) far better food than they've had in some time.  One squiggle of a squabble I did have involved the crows perching continually in the Nevermore tree.  Shouldn't they be ravens?  Otherwise, I liked Count Olaf's latest disguise (hence my wish that I could hear the audio of this book) and I especially enjoyed the clues and mystery in the tale.  The author has the difficult job of continually upping the ante, as it were, while keeping these stories invigorating and interesting.  At the end of this book the Baudelaires are in the direst of straits, but I have little doubt that they'll eventually pull through.  Call it a bolt of optimism from the blue, if you will.Then I remembered that I am currently 26 years of age and this book was written, ostensibly, for kids.

So while her pictures are all well and good, I have to admit that usually they do nothing for me.  I appreciate their beauty and composition but that's normally the extent of my emotional attachment to them.  Yet even in my neutral Vivas state, I have to admit that \\"Sleepy Pendoodle\\" really touched me.  A sweet story of pet care, the book cleverly combines a bouncy catchy narrative with delightful adorable pictures.  This is one of those picture book pairings of author and illustrator you wish you could find more often.<br /><br />One day our heroine (an unnamed but a spunky kid) finds a puppy alone and forgotten in an alley.  He is, \\"a funny little, bonny little, lost little pup\\".  She takes him in and feeds him but the pup refuses to open his eyes.  Distraught she goes to her Uncle Hughie who appears to be roughly twenty years of age.  Hughie gives the girl strict instructions on how to open the puppy's eyes.  She must scrubby-scrub her hands and put him on her knee.  Then she must say, \\"Open your eyes, Sleepy Pendoodle!  Open your eyes, you pup!\\".  The little girl runs home in a flutter but becomes so distracted by the passing people that she forgets her uncle's instructions.  Did he say for her to scrub her knees?  Or was she supposed to put the puppy on her back?  Finally she gets the instructions right and the viewer is rewarded with a glorious and shocking two page spread of the puppy with his eyes open wide.  Soon he's running and playing like any other canine.  On the final page we see a large dog with a leash in his mouth and the words, \\"And now he's a big red dog\\".  A very Clifford-like ending.<br /><br />The text is irresistable.  This is just the kind of story whose cadences lend themselves to multiple tellings.  And the illustrations compliment the text fairly perfectly.  To my mind, there is nothing to compare with the shot of the puppy finally opening his eyes.  Vivas has outdone herself here.  Sleepy Pendoodle is almost life-size in the shot and he's held in a most adorable fashion by the girl's chubby hands.  This book is ideal for story times, you know.  If you need a crowd pleaser with a fun plot, enjoyable words, and some really striking illustrations, grab yerself a little, \\"Sleepy Pendoodle\\".

Arbitrators of historical accuracy in works of fiction decried &quot;Catherine Called Birdy&quot; as a travesty when it first came out. They said it was inaccurate and filled with factual misrepresentations. They said the main character could not and would not have acted the way she did (Birdy is both headstrong and willful) not because she wasn't capable of it but because of the times in which she lived (Medieval England). I was very partial to &quot;Catherine Called Birdy&quot; when I read it. I thought it was a breezy romp through a time entirely different from our own today. I thought the plot was enjoyable, the main character likable, and the setting fascinating. But yes, if pressed, I would admit that this is definitely not the book you're going to want to read to if you want a realistic portrayal of the Middle Ages. So there it is.<br /><br /> Lady Catherine (called Birdy) is the fourteen-year-old daughter of a knight and lady of a manor. Their only daughter, she is expected to wed soon, thereby bringing in a significant price from her suitor. Birdy, however, has other ideas. She knows that in terms of some people (barons, kings, etc.) her family is not particularly rich, but she also feels that no money in the world would be worth her marriage to some empty headed blockhead. As such, the book follows the day-to-day activities of a young lady in jolly old England as she outsmarts and drives away a variety of different potential husbands. To do so, the tale is told through Birdy's journal entries, usually beginning with a note as to what the saint day it is and how they died. The book really hits its stride when Birdy finds herself engaged to a man that repulses and disgusts her more than any other she's met thus far.<br /><br /> I contest the notion that the book is entirely inaccurate, however. First of all, the ending of the book is, however fortuitous, believable. I feel the book taken as a whole is meant to show how trapped the lives of women during medieval times were. We are constantly bombarded with images of cages and caged birds. Birdy is told not to fight her position in life since it will do her little good. The book does not end with Birdy marrying outside her class or running away to live the single life. Instead, it remains faithful to the ideals of the time, for which I was very glad.<br /><br /> Just the same, Birdy is not your average girl. I have to agree that she's a mighty unlikely character for her time period too. Girls reading about her today might identify with her intrinsically, but that's only because she's written with a particularly modern eye. For example, Birdy expresses an interest in running away and joining the Crusades. I challenge anyone to say that any girl growing up in 1290 England even harbored a glimpse of a thought about such a thing. It wasn't just the girls couldn't, it was the fact that they would have considered such an idea alien to their culture. Birdy has lots of thoughts along these lines as well. She likes to fart and spit and do all sorts of things that, quite frankly, girls younger than fourteen might be into but that a kid her age would probably have outgrown. That was actually one of my problems with the book as well. Too often is Birdy immature for her age or irrational beyond her otherwise cool head. After all, being fourteen now and being fourteen then were two entirely different ideas. People grew up faster back in the day, an idea that Birdy does not seen to convey. In fact, in some things Birdy is perfectly ahead of her years. She seems to have a very clear idea of sex and human reproduction. On viewing some grass stained villagers returning from the woods she observes wryly that there will probably be quite a few babies born the coming December. Nine months away, that is.<br /><br /> Just the same, I liked this book. I liked how Birdy's conceptions of humans on the whole changes. I liked the humor in this tale, something that most books set in the Middle Agesneglect. In short, I liked &quot;Catherine Called Birdy&quot; in spite of its flaws. Author Cushman is good enough to include an Author's Note at the end of this text that offers not only further information about the times, but non-fiction resources and other medieval children's books for reference. I challenge you to read this story and not enjoy it, at least on some level. It's a lovely romp. And if you still find yourself yearning for something a little more believable, check out &quot;Dante's Daughter&quot; instead.&quot;Catherine Called Birdy&quot; in spite of its flaws.

Published originally in 1973, the story tells the tale of a pack of mice that decide to leave the city life and become sea faring rodents instead.  Together, the seven little creatures take a small antique ship (with working cannon) from the antique store in which they leave and set sail into the sea.  When at long last they come across a tropical isle, they are shocked to discover that the land already has an inhabitant.  According to their books, this is the island of the Skog.  Not entirely certain what a Skog is, they bombard the land with cannon balls.  That done, they set about inhabiting the isle but are shocked to discover giant footprints.  After successfully unmasking the creature, they discover that perhaps jumping to conclusions is not the best policy when meeting people different from yourself for the first time.<br /><br />I suppose the book is ostensibly about judging people before you get to know them.  I prefer to think that this story is a cry against the whole, \\"Shoot first, ask questions later\\", method of diplomacy that a nation (who shall remain nameless) may employ from time to time.  Or, more likely, I'm reading too much into an entirely pleasant picture book.  This is a true Kellogg creation through and through.  Filled to the brim with his tiny details and intricacies, a reader could pour over each page for a month so as to best locate all the delicate touches.  As you go through the tale, each character has his or her own distinct personality.  Jenny, the unofficial mouse in charge, and Bouncer the head of his bowling league are the two main characters, but they've a lively and involved supporting crew as well.  Rereading the tale now, I was shocked to see how dated the three bowling team mice in their overlarge sports jerseys were.  Why they're positively 1973!  Otherwise, these pictures are somewhat timeless.  The images in this tale stuck in my brain for years, so I can guarantee to you that any child that reads this book today will take it with them the rest of their lives.  Though everyone has a favorite Kellogg creation of their own, one of my picks without a doubt is the inestimable \\"Island of the Skog\\".  Take.  Read.

After twenty pages I said to myself, \\"Hm! The man can really write!\\".  After fifty pages I said, \\"Wow!  This book is as good as `Holes'!\\".  After one hundred and fifty pages I was fully engrossed.  After two hundred and fifty pages I was bodily grabbing people off of the street, forcing copies into their hands while chanting something along the lines of, \\"One of the greatest kid's books ever written!\\", or words to that extent.  Now that I've finished the book and given myself a little time to reflect I can clearly decide whether or not this initial euphoria was short lived or not.  Ladies and gentlemen, I am more than a little pleased to report that I was right all along.  \\"Tangerine\\" is one of the greatest children's books to be written in the last ten years.  It is brilliant, socially conscious, filled to the brim with sympathetic (and uniquely unsympathetic) characters, and funny to boot.<br /><br />Paul Fisher is moving again.  His father is a civil engineer by trade, so Paul's a little used to picking up and leaving for the next town.  In this particular case, the family's moving to Florida to live in a gated community. Once there, each member will be able to start doing what they enjoy best.  His brother, Erik, will continue to wow everyone with his football skills, his father will continue to worship those skills and spend all his time with his eldest, his mother will join the community's neighborhood association, and Paul will join his school's soccer team.  Paul's a goalie by training, and despite his eye troubles (he has almost zero peripheral vision due to a mysterious accident in his youth) he's the best.  Not like anyone notices, of course.  The rest of the family is too caught up in what Paul has wryly dubbed the Erik Fisher Football Dream.  The fact that Erik is a seriously disturbed individual seems to go entirely unseen by Paul's parents and it becomes clear that when his brother's activities go from threatening to criminal, Paul's the only one who can come out with the truth.  Along the way he has to battle lightning storms, sinkholes, underground fires, flash frosts, and angry neighborhood associations.<br /><br />That's the plot in its barest form.  As I've copied it down here, I haven't even begun to delve into the fact that Paul transfers himself from his local hoity-toity school in the suburbs to a far more rough and tumble public facility.  He makes friends with the kids in that school, faces racism on the part of his old school chums, and begins to understand a little more about white privilege.  What other school age novel deals with racism, classism, social consciousness, and environmental concerns and so well at that?  The precarious nature of Paul's new home becomes clearer and clearer when expensive koi fish are eaten by the native ospreys, muck fires spring up regularly in the backyard, and termites start eating the houses.  The more the humans attempt to bend nature to their will, the funnier the situations become.  This would not be a bad book to pair with the similarly Florida set story, \\"Hoot\\".<br /><br />I was a little surprised at the psychopathic nature of Paul's brother.  Having just finished reading Diana Wynne Jones's excellent, \\"Archer's Goon\\", which contains the most evil little sister in literature, I was amazed to find that my next book, \\"Tangerine\\", contains the world's worst elder brother.  Erik and his brother have exactly one conversation in this entire novel.  Beyond that, all we know of Erik comes from Paul's slowly clearing memories about the accident that damaged his sight and Erik's own actions.  As Paul's parents strive to prove that they're a perfect family, things become worse and worse.  I liked that Paul was as mature a kid as he was.  Though he certainly says words and thoughts that are a little old for a seventh grader, you feel safe with him as your narrator.  When he overreacts, you understand why.  The same goes for when he doesn't react at all.<br /><br />I'll skip telling you about the symbolism that also went into this tale.  Needless to say, if you've a kid that needs to read a book that's rife with it, just pick this one out.  I'm still amazed that this was Edward Bloor's first novel.  The level of the writing is not only impressive, but also intense.  This is the first book I've read (outside, I'll admit, of Harry Potter) that actually made me interested in sports.  I loved reading about Paul's soccer games and how he compares them to football.  Best of all are the characters in this tale.  Even Paul's parents, horribly flawed but earnest, are at least trying to be good people.  The book is, above all, honest.  And I appreciated that.<br /><br />The highest praise I can offer \\"Tangerine\\" is this:  Long after I finished a chapter or two I would find myself puzzling over the multiple meanings and layers of the text.  Whole sentences and ideas kept popping up to be reread and regurgitated.  If you want a children's book that will make you think about a host of different ideas and points of view, read \\"Tangerine\\".same goes for when he doesn't react at all.<BR> <BR>I'll skip telling you about the symbolism that also went into this tale.

A great book with a great story and a great moral and it brought me down low.  But that's okay.  I got over it.  I was doing all right.  Then I idly picked up John Marsden's, \\"The Rabbits\\" in my local lending library.  Suddenly all the feelings I'd ever felt after reading \\"The Lorax\\" were back, but stronger.  I came to the realization that this book was better than the Seussian creation.  It carries a different message, but the idea behind the tale (and the method of teaching it) is the same.  Once you've read \\"The Rabbits\\", you can't unread it.  It sticks in your brain and you start to see its scenes replaying themselves in your mind at the oddest of times.  The best word I can conjure up to describe this book is \\"haunting\\".  It's like nothing you've ever read before.<br /><br />To read this book requires understanding a little about its background.  Originally published (as far as I could ascertain by the nationalities of the author and illustrator) in Australia, the book is about the effects of colonization.  As you may recall, rabbits were once a foreign species that was introduced to the Australian wildlife with disastrous results.  Devouring the native resources and spreading like mad, both they and cane toads are considered dangerous pests.  Taking that idea as a starter, we follow the arrival of civilized rabbits on a vaguely Australian-like land.  The story is told from the point of view of some brown curly tailed spear carrying native animals.  As the book begins the native animals say, \\"At first we didn't know what to think.  They looked a bit like us.  There weren't many of them\\".  Time passes and more and more rabbits come to the land.  They build their own kinds of houses and introduce their own animals.  When the native creatures (bush babies, perhaps?) fight back they loose because there are too many rabbits.  The rabbits destroy the land and (in the worst and most heart-wrenching scene in the book) they, \\"Stole Our Children\\".  Rabbit driven planes fly away with little baby creatures in kites trailing behind as they parents run along the ground, their arms extended.  In the end, the land is bare and all the animals are gone.  In a final picture, a native creature sits across from a rabbit next to a tiny puddle that reflects the stars, the ground littered with trash.  The animals asks, \\"Who will save us from the rabbits?\\"<br /><br />Sad?  You don't know the half of it.  It was delightful seeing how many details in this tale were particular to the Australian aboriginal people.  The fact that their children were taken by the white settlers to be taught in white schools.  Pictures of the fights (natives destroying the rabbit proof fences).  Symbols repeat in illustration after illustration.  The rabbit's flags look British, until you realize that the lines on them are arrows pointing everywhere.  The guns and houses of the rabbits are inscribed with the words, \\"Might = Right\\".  If author John Marsden is clever, illustrator Shaun Tan matches him pound for pound.  This tale is artistically and morally interesting.  I've spent more time than I like to think about poring over these pages.  The book is covered in the most minute and fascinating details.  Notice the single yellow flower that grows in the rabbits' town.  The fact that the rabbits are partitioning out the land, even as they draw topographic lines on the ground. The cows that are permanently attached to milking machines and that already have their tasty parts outlined on their bodies.<br /><br />It all comes down to that final question: Is this a book for children?  Originally I said no and my husband said yes.  Then I looked closely at the book.  It's not without a glimpse of hope, you know.  Even as the little creature at the end asks, \\"Where is the rich dark earth brown and moist?\\", there's a rabbit sadly dropping the dry rotten dust of the ground from its hand.  The final shot of the two creatures facing one another across the tiny pond suggests that the only one to save them from the rabbits are the rabbits themselves.  If enough see what has gone wrong, that is.  Some children will understand this story intrinsically while others will be brought down low by it.  Know your child before you decide whether or not to share this book with them.  If you decide they might not be ready yet, buy it anyway for yourself.  Books like this one are rare pieces of art that disappear so quickly.  This tale is ideal for those adults that are learning to read as well.  Honestly, I don't know what more I can say to make you want to buy this book.  If I have to, I'll beg you.  Please.  To read this is to experience something deeply touching.  People so rarely get a chance to see books this well made.  Take the chance and find it.e ground from its hand.

Not that you'd necessarily know it from this book, but David Shannon is perhaps one of the best children's author/illustrators out there today.  Are you at all familiar with \\"Duck on the Bike\\"?  You should be.  How about the gorgeous \\"The Rough-Faced Girl\\"?  Run and purchase it immediately.  \\"No, David!\\" strays a little from these other books, not only in terms of picture quality but also in text and narrative.  Though certainly an original idea and a fun creation on the whole, I'm afraid that this particular Shannon offering is a little less impressive than its picture book brethren.<br /><br />David Shannon was sent a small book by his mother, prior to writing this story.  A little book that he created as a boy, the only words that appeared in the text of the tale were the words, \\"No\\" and \\"David\\".  The pictures showed David doing the very things he was not allowed to do.  Using this idea as his springboard, Mr. Shannon has remade his little book into a wild raucous retelling.  Here's David once again, doing all the things he shouldn't.  His antics aren't particularly vile or disgusting.  In one picture David has tracked mud into is living room.  In another, we see the merry naked backside of the boy springing down the street.  All this culminates with the moment David accidentally breaks his mother's vase and is relegated to the corner of the room.  With big arms we see him run towards his mom, finally enveloped in a big ole hug with the final words, \\"Yes, David...I love you\\".  Thereby reinforcing the idea that no matter how bad David gets, he's still loved at the end.<br /><br />The illustrations for this tale are a kind of slightly modified version of the one's Mr. Shannon presumably drew as a young `un.  David has the triangle notes and closed off body parts usually found in children's pictures.  Just the same, there's sophistication clearly apparent from page to page.  The final shot of David being held by his mother gives the boy a sweet loving countenance (complete with the first appearance of his eyelashes).  I've read some reviews of this book that complain that children might be scared by David's teeth.  And honestly, they have a point.  David has anywhere from six to nine sharp pointy objects in his mouth that become more or less pronounced as his activities grow more or less violent.  Some children are not going to like `em, while others will love pointy-tooth David and his antics.  The best way to gauge a kid's reactions to this book would be to simply show them the cover.  If they think it's swell or horrific, you'll know right away.<br /><br />As for me, the book's not too terribly original.  There are plenty of books drawn to look like their authors are four (both intentionally and not) and as for bad boys you need only locate Max from \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\".  This isn't a bad book but nor it is particularly striking or memorable.  Feel free to purchase it.  Just understand its limitations beforehand.e with the first appearance of his eyelashes).

619212:US	49148452	R20IAA77H03W59	0060298898	804242939	Archer's Goon	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Hare today, goon tomorrow	I'm not gonna lie to you.  This book is about a Goon belonging to Archer.  To be exact, it is about the repercussions of living with a Goon for an extended amount of time.  I've slowly been devouring the collected works of Diana Wynne Jones and so far I haven't been disappointed by a single one of her titles.  Each book is even odder and more bizarre than the last, often causing the reader to clasp his or her head from time to time and shout, \\"How does she think this stuff up?\\".  \\"Arthur's Goon\\" is no exception to this rule.  A brilliantly warped view of absolute power corrupting absolutely and the power plays that go on between siblings (no matter what their age), this book deserves to be remembered as one of the best children's novels out there today.<br /><br />Walter comes home one day to discover a Goon sitting in his family's kitchen.  Your typical hired heavy, the Goon has been sent by the mysterious Archer to collect from Walter's dad about 2000 words.  It seems that for the last 13 years Walter's father (Howard) has been writing 2000 words a month and sending them off to a mysterious somebody.  Now the words have become misplaced and the Goon has been sent to collect.  As Howard steadfastly refuses to type any more, things start to go a little crazy.  It isn't long before Walter and his family come to realize that their town is run by seven power mad sibling wizards.  These wizards have been trapped in the town and each one runs a different part of it.  For example, Dillian farms (that means runs) the police force while Shine farms crime.  Now it's up to Walter to solve the mystery of the seven mysterious beings and to figure out who exactly is behind their entrapment within the town.<br /><br />Author Jones is equally a master at engaging peculiar characters as she is creating complex multi-layered plots.  You grow to love the Goon as he grows horribly lovesick for a young college student staying with Walter and his family.  And who wouldn't identify with Walter when he has to deal with his appropriately nicknamed little sister Awful.  I would venture to guess that she's the worst little sister character I have ever encountered in a kid's book, and that's saying a lot.  Then there's the mystery to contend with.  As Walter meets more and more of the seven the reader slowly is given clues to understand who's behind it all.  Not since Raskin's, \\"The Westing Game\\" did I have this much fun with a mysterious kid's book.  And to be honest, I never guessed the ending until I was told.  The surprise twist this book carries is a doozy.  If you figure out who's behind it all before they tell you then you're probably the kind of person who downs Agatha Christie novels like pop tarts.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have a bone to pick with this book.  Sad to say, either I wasn't bright enough for some of the loose ends here or they were just too darn loose.  The ending of this story is never fully explained and (to be frank) I don't believe we ever do find out EXACTLY how the seven brothers and sisters were trapped in the town at all.  Some of these points are glossed over so beautifully that it takes a full three hours after putting the book down to realize what it is that you have missed.  Now I'm 26 years of age and if I can't understand parts of this tale it's probably a fair guess that your average 10 year-old reader with have similar problems.<br /><br />Still, that's my only quarrel.  There's so much to love here that I feel a little dour making these kinds of comments.  I mean, how can you dislike a book where a character like Awful is constantly asking the seven wizards where they come in order of birth so that she can better understand the pecking order in the family?  It's a delightful tale about family fights and what it is that exactly makes up a family at all.  And then of course there's the goon.  Last of all I display for you the fabulous goon that starts this book rolling and, quite possibly, ends it.  Here's to goons, ladies and gentlemen!  May they grace the pages of more and more children's books in the future.nd gentlemen!  May they grace the pages of more and more children's books in the future.	2004-06-22

The first two being, of course, \\"Love You Forever\\" and \\"The Giving Tree\\".  I don't feel like explaining why this statement is not only brilliant but sublime, so instead I'm going to review this seemingly innocent little picture book.  Here we have a very dull book with a very poor message.  In my humble opinion, it hardly deserves much notice.<br /><br />Originally a Swiss picture book (who knew?), \\"Rainbow Fish\\" tells the tale of a little sparkly fellow below the sea.  The Rainbow Fish glitters and glides in the ocean's depths, ignoring the calls of the other fish to come out and play.  One day a little fish asks for one of his shiny scales.  The Rainbow Fish is not exactly polite in his refusal, but for some reason this is the comment that causes all the other fish to make him a social pariah.  The Rainbow Fish is a little upset by this and asks the advice of a wise old octopus.  Unfortunately the octopus is of the opinion that Rainbow Fish should give away the very things that make him special.  His shiny scales.  Once he has given a scale to all the other fishes he'll look exactly like everyone else and be happy.  He does and then is.  The end.<br /><br />I suppose if you looked at this book from a religious context it might make a little more sense.  But even then the moral would still run along the lines of give-up-your-worldly-possessions-and-everybody-will-like-you.  Hm.  What makes this book so offensive to some readers is the simple fact that it's is preaching a kind of same = good mentality.  Tis better to meld with the crowd than to hold onto that which makes you an individual and unique, it sayeth.  Then there are the illustrations to contend with.  In an interesting marketing technique, the shiny scales Rainbow Fish sports are small hologram-ish cut-outs that line his body.  Little kids will, presumably, see the shiny things on the cover of the book and immediately grab it.  But how stand the rest of the illustrations?  Certainly the colors in this tale are luminous and lovely.  Pfister has developed a lovely watercolor technique wherein the blended shades of the scenes work perfectly within the context of the story.  Unfortunately, the actual illustrations themselves are fairly hum drum.  Don't expect the breathtaking loveliness of Eric Carle's \\"Mister Seahorse\\" or even the originality of a similar seaside tale, Irene Haas's, \\"The Maggie B.\\".  Characters here never change expression (except that once in a while their little fishy mouths curl either up or down as appropriate).  As a gimmick, the shiny scales work well.  Just don't pay much attention to anything else in this tale.<br /><br />The best advice I can give regarding \\"The Rainbow Fish\\" is to recommend Leo Lionni's classic picture book, \\"Swimmy\\".  Like The Rainbow Fish, Swimmy's a little guppy who's different from everyone else.  But rather than, oh say, changing his scale color to blend in, Swimmy uses his unique position in society to help those around him while remaining true to himself.  A powerful statement that \\"The Rainbow Fish\\" sorely lacks.  I'm not saying this is the worst picture book ever written, mind you.  Just a mediocre one.  With all the wonderful picture books out there, why not grab the best and leave the rest?  Or, if we're going to take the advice of the Rainbow Fish to heart, do what everyone else is doing and strive for mediocrity.

Mem Fox fans are a livid crew.  If you've ever met one then I think you might know what I mean.  When you meet a Mem Fox fan, it is more than likely that you may find yourself grabbed bodily as your arms start to fill with Mem Fox book after Mem Fox book.  Mem Fox fans love her work and are quick to recommend everything she's done in a thrice.  If you should feel like giving in and reading her works, then let me recommend that you begin with the delightful, \\"Wilfrid Gordon McDonald Partridge\\".  A touching tale of a boy and his elderly friend, the book explores the nature of memory itself in a way that children can understand.<br /><br />Wilfrid Gordon McDonald Partridge lives next to an old folks home and (as the book is quick to point out), \\"he wasn't very old either\\".  Just a scrappy young boy, Wilfrid likes all the old people in the home, but his favorite is Miss Nancy Alison Delacourt Cooper because she has just as many names as he does.  One day Wilfrid hears his parents tsk tsking over the fact that Miss Nancy has lost her memory.  Wilfrid asks what a memory is and his pop explains that it's something you remember.  This definition doesn't sit well with young Wilfrid, however, and he runs over to the neighbors to get a little more clarification.  What he finds instead, however, are mixed messages.  I mean, Mrs. Jordon says a memory is something warm, while Mr. Hosking says it's from long ago.  Mr. Tippett says it's something that makes you cry while Miss Mitchell claims it's what makes you laugh.  And to top it all off Mr. Drysdale says it's as precious as gold, period.  Using his head, Wilfrid decides to put things from his own memories into a box to give to Miss Nancy.  After giving her the things one by one, Miss Nancy suddenly realizes that she does remember bits and pieces of her life by going through the objects.  We watch as a medal reminds her of her brother who went to war and didn't come back, and a puppet reminds her of one she herself owned and would entertain her sister with.  And that is how a small boy helped Miss Nancy find her memory again.<br /><br />The fear behind a book such as this is that it might unduly raise the expectations of those kids whose beloved grandparents suffer from such memory sapping diseases as Alzheimer's or dementia.  After all, Wilfrid makes it look so easy.  But if used conscientiously the story is a sweet intergenerational tale for all kids to enjoy.  Who wouldn't want to run around playing with a bunch of wise elders like this crew?  There is a definite sense that Wilfrid is a great comfort to these people and his easy going camaraderie with them is a joy to behold.  The story is a well told one, hinting at the backgrounds of these different men and women but never exactly telling anything specifically.  I was also pleased to find that Miss Nancy's memories were not purely cheerful ones.  She remembers sad facts as easily as happy ones, suggesting that perhaps nothing is worth forgetting.  And where else will preschoolers be given the chance to discuss the nature of memory itself?<br /><br />Add to Mem Fox's adept narration the color imbued illustrations of artist Julie Vivas and you've got yourself a hit!  Vivas has such an original eye-catching style that it's difficult not to recognize it instantly.  It's a little like a rounded out Patricia Pollacco.  Here the elderly sport slippers and elastically-challenged socks as well as fabulous multi-colored dresses and baggy pants.  Wilfrid is your average kid, skateboarding in the old folks home and climbing hither and yon.  I was especially taken with the shot of him lying upside down between his parents as he father lazily carries his teddy bear.  Most interesting are the pictures of Miss Nancy's past.  Here the young red headed Miss Nancy (looking a little like Wilfrid's older sister, perhaps) sports lank black tights, high brown button shoes, and eclectic purple silk loose-fitting chemises.  Kids won't notice the obviously oddclothing, but parents may pause a moment and wonder just how exactly it is that Miss Nancy found such clothes back then.<br /><br />Still, it's a lovely tale.  Full of wit and imagination.  Many picture books contain active elderly characters, but few contain so many within a single book.  Here we have a story that gives respect to the older AND younger members of our society at the same time.  We owe so much to both that it's nice to see a story that gives them the fun color filled adventure they so richly deserve.hing, but parents may pause a moment and wonder just how exactly it is that Miss Nancy found such clothes back then.  <BR> <BR>Still, it's a lovely tale.

He is fan-freakin-tastic	Is there any higher praise an author/illustrator can receive than to hear a reviewer say, \\"Well, I never really loved anything else this person did, but I think this book is bloody brilliant\\"?  Probably.  But I for one feel that Gerald McDermott (who I've always respected but never felt any real affection for) really hit the nail on the head with this book.  \\"Zomo\\" has the near impossible task of being both amusing and informative.  So many African folktales relayed in children's picture books end up being a little dry and dated.  For example, the book \\"Zomo\\" most resembles in plot is, \\"A Story, A Story\\" by G. Haley.  Yet that book is a dour dull creation when compared to this amazing little concoction.  This is a book that every child should read at least once in their lives.<br /><br />As you open the book you see a clever little rabbit all decked out in kinte cloth.  The text reads, \\"Zomo!  Zomo the rabbit.  He is not big.  He is not strong.  But he is very clever\\".  When Zomo decides that being clever is not enough and that he wants wisdom as well he quickly requests it from the Sky God.  To attain wisdom's secrets, the Sky God commands Zomo to fetch him the scales of Big Fish of the sea, the milk of Wild Cow, and the tooth of Leopard.  Zomo immediately sets out to fulfill these tasks.  For the fish he plays a catchy tune on his drum, so entrancing the sea dwelling creature that it dances its scales off.  The Wild Cow is lured into a tree and, while stuck, Zomo milks it.  As for Leopard, some of the slippery scales dropped into slippery milk cause the feline to slip and knock out a tooth.  When Zomo presents these items to the Sky God he is instantly told that wisdom consists of courage, good sense, and caution.  Zomo has thus far had the first two, but now with three new enemies he should exercise the last for a while.<br /><br />I think what I loved best about this book was Zomo himself.  This is a remarkable thing too.  Too often the cocky hero of a tale (especially a trickster tale) is too brash and self-important to garner any real love from the reader.  But Zomo's different.  He's sprightly and a joy to follow.  From the geometric patterns of his face to the energetic dancing of his little black furry feet, he's a pure pleasure to watch.  The illustrations themselves are so bright and cheery it puts such similarly colorful stories like, \\"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom\\" to shame.  But best of all is the narration.  I've given you the first sentence of the book, but the rest reads just as well.  It's catchy and delightfully placed upon each and every page.<br /><br />Some books you pick up and groan when your kids want you to read them forty or fifty times in a row.  Other books you wish they'd ask you sixty or seventy times more.  \\"Zomo\\" is in the latter category.  A fun filled romp with a delightful West African base, the book is one of the best I've ever had the pleasure to peruse.

Books that break stereotypes rarely do it as intelligently and simply as Charlotte Zolotow's remarkable, \\"William's Doll\\".  Usually if a picture book has something to say, it'll announce the fact to you with great pomp and flair, and maybe a little more pomp.  It'll take its message and shove it down your throat, attempting to cram every little bit of lesson into you.  This is not the case with this book.  In \\"William's Doll\\" you've a delicate tale told in such a way that its message, while remaining very powerful, is spoken in a small quiet voice.<br /><br />William is a boy who wants a doll.  He wants to play with it and hug it.  He wants to tuck it into bed at night and wake it up in the morning and pretend that it's his own child.  Needless to say, this plan is met with not a little bit of derision by his peers.  His brother thinks it's creepy and the boy next door even goes so far as to call William a sissy.  As for William's father, he decides to stem the boy's desires by purchasing manly toys for him.  Basketballs, and trains, and tools.  The only one who understands William is his grandmother, a wise woman who gives William his heart's desire and patiently explains to his father that there is nothing odd or abnormal about a boy wanting a doll.  After all, if girls play with dolls to be good mothers why shouldn't boys play with dolls to be good fathers?<br /><br />There's a bit of a satirical bite to the end of this picture book that I enjoyed.  When the grandmother explains why Williams needs a doll, she tells his father that he needs it so that he'll know how to take care of his own baby, \\"and bring him the things he wants, like a doll so that he can practice being a father\\".  Which is basically her way of saying to William's pop, \\"Obviously you never had a doll as a child, so you're not as prepared a father as William someday will be\\".  Nice.  The book treads a delicate line as well.  Many families today may recognize the fact that it's perfectly possible that William is just as likely to be a boy who wants to be a good father as it is that he may someday be gay (obviously his father's big worry).  And there's nothing wrong with that.  But whatever William's reasons for wanting a doll, this book makes it plain that gender stereotypes are wrongdy wrong wrong.  So I was very taken with the story.  The illustrations are rather nice as well.  The book was written in 1972, and as such there are some incredibly 70s children here.  William looks half a step away from joining the Partridge Family on their bus.  His brother and brother's friend look normal enough, but they're fans of wearing tennis sweaters and white shorts, something seen rarely today.  Illustrator William Pene Du Bois conveys the tender feelings William wishes to lavish upon his doll perfectly.  His pictures are just as adept at placing a sly look into the protagonist's eyes when he beats his brother and pal at basketball as when William stares longingly at the neighbor girl's doll.  The result is a perfectly written little work that stands to be remembered today.<br /><br />It's a little sad that the idea of boys playing with dolls is just as scoffed at today as it was in 1972.  Not much progress has been made in that area, I'm afraid.  If you don't believe me, just check out the section of Toys R Us labeled \\"Boys\\" and the section labeled \\"Girls\\".  Gender stereotyping is prevalent in our society, and will likely remain so for a long long time.  That alone is reason enough for books like \\"William's Doll\\" to remain in circulation.  As long as a book is capable to teaching both kids and adults an important lesson, it will remain an influential work.  So a tip of the hat to \\"William's Doll\\".

It had all the markings of it.  Animals in clothing tricking one another out of food of one sort or another.  The hero was a hare and the villain a bear.  But on reading this book I was in for a shock.  A staple of the Brer Rabbit tales is the idea that sometimes luck and laziness go hand in hand.  Brer Rabbit is forever tricking the other animals into doing his work for him rather than the other way around.  But in \\"Tops and Bottoms\\" we have a very familiar message to contend with.  Hard work pays off.<br /><br />The book is drawn in a rather original format.  Rather than holding the book with the spine horizontal, instead this tale can only be read with the spine completely vertical.  Pictures are long here, rather than wide, and the result is an eclectic new way of telling a tale.  It's enormously effective.  In this story, a lazy bear owns most of the land.  One day, Hare decides its time to buy some of his own land back.  He strikes up a deal with the prematurely hibernating neighbor and the two become business partners.  If Hare does all the work, Bear can chose the part of the crop he prefers.  Either the tops or the bottoms.  It soon becomes clear that Bear is no match for the sly hare.  After all, when Bear chooses the tops, Hare plants carrots.  When Bear understands his mistake he chooses bottoms and Hare plants lettuce and celery.  And when Bear demands both the tops AND the bottoms, Hare plants corn and gets the middle.  In the end, Bear learns the benefits of hard work (and staying on top of things) and Hare has enough money from the crops to own his own land again.<br /><br />A word of caution: If you're using this book with the intention of utilizing it to teach youngsters about farming cycles, cease and desist.  In the course of this tale, Hare harvests his crops three times over the summer months.  His youngsters also weed the garden of unusually hardy dandelions each and every time Bear instructs Hare to plant again.  Still, as complaints go this one's fairly petty.  The story is funny and well written.  Hare has a wonderful way of roping Bear into the deal, coming off with phrases like, \\"Yes, sir, Bear, we're in this together.  I'll work and you sleep\\".  Better still are the illustrations.  From Bear's permanently loose tie and oversized shoes to Hare's gaudy carrot covered Hawaiian shirt, the characters here are alive and kicking.  Stevens also has a great talent drawing vegetables.  I've rarely seen the stems of radishes as wonderfully rendered as they are in this book.  And best of all, Hare is aided and abetted by his hard working kin.  Baby rabbits fill the pages, usually hiding over, under, above, and through every vegetable in the book.  My favorite moment was the scene in which Hare presents the tops AND bottoms of the corn.  There, in the lower left hand corner stands Mrs. Hare, studiously removing the roots of the plant to place in the \\"bottoms\\" pile.<br /><br />In effect, Janet Stevens has taken the essence of the Brer Rabbit tales and switched the message about 180 degrees.  And you know what?  It doesn't matter.  Because Hare still gets the best of Bear and the story is a well-told romp.  Add in the gorgeous pictures and the amazing format and you've got yourself a bonafide hit.  As great read aloud books go, this is definitely one of the best.  A highly recommended story time favorite.youngsters also weed the garden of unusually hardy dandelions each and every time Bear instructs Hare to plant again.

I've rarely seen the stems of radishes as wonderfully rendered as they are in this book.  And best of all, Hare is aided and abetted by his hard working kin.  Baby rabbits fill the pages, usually hiding over, under, above, and through every vegetable in the book.  My favorite moment was the scene in which Hare presents the tops AND bottoms of the corn.  There, in the lower left hand corner stands Mrs. Hare, studiously removing the roots of the plant to place in the \\"bottoms\\" pile.  <BR> <BR>In effect, Janet Stevens has taken the essence of the Brer Rabbit tales and switched the message about 180 degrees.  And you know what?  It doesn't matter.  Because Hare still gets the best of Bear and the story is a well-told romp.  Add in the gorgeous pictures and the amazing format and you've got yourself a bonafide hit.  As great read aloud books go, this is definitely one of the best.  A highly recommended story time favorite.	2004-06-17

Yet another African alphabet book.  It wasn't too long ago that I read, \\"Jambo Means Hello\\", the Swahili alphabet book by Muriel Feelings that was published in 1974.  That book was okay, but I was disappointed that it didn't distinguish between tribes or acknowledge the advance of technology in Africa in the 1970s.  Then I picked up this 1976 Caldecott winning book and upon reading it I was stunned.  This book is everything that \\"Jambo Mean Hello\\" SHOULD have been.  With meticulously researched information, delicate details, and stunning illustrations this book deserves to be read to every single child in elementary school for as long as there are either children or schools.<br /><br />The book goes through the alphabet by naming a different tribe for each letter.  First of all, I was surprised that there actually was an African tribe for every letter in the alphabet.  Shows what I know.  As we view each tribe we get a stunning illustration of their clothing, towns or villages, and activities.  Author Margaret Musgrove describes their life, picking out the most interesting details for each.  Through this method we learn that in Baule legend the crocodiles aided them when they were at war with the Ashanti.  Or we find out that in the Tuareg tribe the men are veiled and the women do most of the talking, storytelling, and poetry.  From A to Z we see a wide spectrum of African inhabitants, ending with a map of Africa that shows where each tribe resides.<br /><br />But it doesn't stop there.  Feelings explains in her Author's Note in the front that modern technology is changing the face of African life, though she contends that the traditions pictured in this book are still being passed on from generation to generation.  She points out that some customs mentioned here are unique and relate only to that particular tribe while other values and philosophies are shared by all.  She is even so careful as to point out that many (not all) African language prefixes are added to denote the plural.  She, however, has used the root words throughout the book for simplicity's sake.  Should you have any doubts about the background of this author, you can read in a tiny note on the publication page that she lived and studied in Ghana for years and a list of publications consulted is included.  And if you've any doubts about the illustrations, don't.  As noted, even the interwoven designs at the corners of the pages are based on Kano Knots.  Every article of clothing, every animal, every home depicted here is accurate and beautiful.<br /><br />I don't mean to pooh-pooh \\"Jambo Means Hello\\", but that book hasn't got anything on the amazing \\"Ashanti to Zulu\\".

Originally published in 1988, \\"Matilda\\" was one of the last books author Roald Dahl wrote before his death in 1990.  Most authors as they age become more cynical and dour.  Think of the final writings of Dickens or Twain and how bitter they seemed in their late years.  Then look at \\"Matilda\\".  Here we have a sweet charming little piece of literature about a girl that is both good and interesting.  Creating characters that you identify intrinsically with is not only difficult but (in children's books) sometimes near impossible.  Reading \\"Matilda\\", it becomes clear that Roald Dahl never lost his touch for creating wonderful original characters and situations.<br /><br />The heroine of this little book also carries its name.  Matilda is incredibly intelligent, even as a small child.  Living with her boorish parents and oblivious brother, she teaches herself to read from the various magazine and newspapers lying about the house. Her parents are completely indifferent to their only daughter and it is only by playing small tricks on them when they've been particularly nasty that little Matilda is able to keep a hold on her sanity.  By age five and a half Matilda has read all the children's books in the library and quite a few of the adult ones as well.  On entering school for the first time, our protagonist comes face to face with a very worthy enemy.  The Head Teacher, Miss Trunchbull, is the worst kind of dangerous violent adult.  It is only through Matilda's cleverness that she is able to come to the aid of her teacher, Miss Honey, and save the school from the Trunchbull's insanity.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, Matilda is just the nicest kid ever.  Intelligent without ever becoming pig-headed.  Nice without becomes precious.  She's just a swell child all around.  Through her, Dahl takes some mighty fine cracks as his fellow kiddie lit authors.  I was especially fond of the portion in which Matilda points out that though C.S. Lewis and Tolkien are fine writers, \\"There aren't many funny bits\\".  And as we all know, Dahl is the master of the funny bit for kids.  This book is chock full of them too.  It contains all the usual peculiar Dahl touches (like kids being swung out of the playground by their pigtails) as well as practical jokes and nasty adults.  The Trunchbull is perhaps THE nastiest adult ever to grace the pages of the Dahl world.  Definitely unhinged, she abuses the children around her, coming just shy of actual physical contact.  It is amazing then that Dahl doesn't dispatch of her in a violent or crazy fashion.  She merely...disappears.  Likewise Matilda's parents get their comeuppance by merely fleeing the country to Spain.  Dahl was quite soft in his old age, it seems.<br /><br />Reading this book today I was struck by how much Lemony Snicket owes to Mr. Dahl.  Not just the usual adults-are-nasty-cruel-and-possibly-batty take, but the narrative voice as well.  It took me a couple minutes to realize that this was Dahl talking and not Mr. Handler.  Illustrated by Quentin Blake, the book is perfectly complimented by the illustrators' insane imaginings and concoctions.  The Blake/Dahl pairing is often inspired, and it works to its best advantage here.  I can't imagine this book without Blake's particular little pointy nosed heroine gracing the pages.  For those parents who either don't approve of Dahl or just don't \\"get\\" him, I think \\"Matilda\\" is the perfect story to win them over.  You'd have to be pretty hard of heart not to love its little heroine and the troubles she gets into.  A charming treat to be enjoyed for years to come.en't many funny bits\\".

The all-encompassing success of German writer Cornelia Funke's \\"The Thief Lord\\" has certainly garnered the most attention, but a certain amount of credit should be handed to British writer Mary Hoffman as well.  After all, she's the one responsible for \\"Stravaganza: City of Masks\\", the first in her Venetian minded \\"Stravaganza\\" series.  A writer adept at evoking the most romantic and mysterious elements of Venice's past, she is slightly less than able at plot and moral aptitude.  But with a package as beautiful as \\"City of Masks\\", it's doubtful the reader will really care.<br /><br />Hoffman's premise is, initially at least, a shaky one.  Lucien is a boy recovering from the chemotherapy that comes with his cancer treatments.  He's fifteen years old and one day receives a gift from his father of a beautiful blank book with marbleized covers.  Lucien falls asleep with the stories of Venice his father has told him, only to awake in a world that is like and unlike Venice itself.  This is Bellezza, a canal based city ruled by a ruthless leader known to all as the Duchessa.  Here Lucien (or, to the people here, Luciano) is free from disease.  It seems the mysterious book he held is the answer to this mystery of stravagation (the means by which a person travels between two worlds).  While he is in Bellezza, Lucien's other body remains in his own world in a kind of coma.  In no time, the boy finds himself in the center of a political thriller involving the Duchessa, assassination attempts, masked balls, mirrored rooms, and a villainous family that will stop at nothing to gain power over the land.<br /><br />As I said before, Hoffman has created her alternate land perfectly.  Here, silver (rather than gold) is the metal of the most worth.  Words are slightly different and what we would call magic in our land is considered science in theirs.  There's a lot to love in this story as well.  From the idea of using lace as a means of secret messages to a permanently masked ruler that will kill anyone who sees her face.  But to be truthful, it was the Duchessa herself that was the biggest problem the book had.  Hoffman works very hard to make it clear that the Duchessa is brilliant and beautiful but utterly ruthless.  When we first meet her we know that she is, at least, a sexual predator.  She chooses her gondoliers (here called mandoliers) from the handsomest young men in the city to be her lovers.  For a moment it almost looks as if Lucien himself will be roped in as one of her many partners, though this idea is quickly averted by the author.  Soon, however, it's clear that the Duchessa hasn't any problems at all with coercing the ones who love her into doing her bidding and that torture is a routine form of getting answers out of prisoners.  The final straw, for me, was when the Duchessa knowingly leads a stupid if simple-minded girl to her death and then feel zippo remorse about the fact.  The horrible thing is that the reader is supposed to be unequivocally on the Duchessa's side through all of this.  Lucien thinks several times how happy he is to not be the Duchessa's enemy.  I suppose this is supposed to be some sort of relief to the reader as well, but it just means that our hero has allied himself with a different kind of evil.  If Hoffman acknowledged that the ruler of Bellezza was evil or twisted it wouldn't be so bad, but she stands firmly behind all the Duchessa's decisions.  The Duchessa's closest equivalent in children's literature might be Mrs. Coulter from the \\"His Dark Materials\\" books by Philip Pullman.  The difference being, of course, that Pullman had the guts to acknowledge that Mrs. Coulter was evil if also containing the capacity for change.  Hoffman fails to make this concession and the book is weaker as a result.<br /><br />Just the same, this is a fun read.  Ignoring the Duchessa, all other plot points and moments in the story areenjoyable and lovingly rendered.  I can say with certainty that you will look forward to reading the other books in this series after reading \\"City of Masks\\".  And I give Hoffman points for including a note on the science of Stravagation at the back of the book.  If nothing else, she is very adept at keeping her book free from loopholes or mistakes in the narration and storyline.  Also, of the four websites Lucien explores in this book, one of them (VirtualVenice.com) does actually exist.  I highly recommend it as well.  From this book's beautiful cover design to its gorgeous descriptions and well-wrought characters, readers will be clamoring for more.  They are certain to be pleased.le and lovingly rendered.

On picking up this book I was greatly afraid that perhaps I'd be reading some dour staid careful accounting of the exact facts surrounding Noah, his ark, and the animals that stayed on it.  Instead, I was somewhat relieved to find that this was a rather cheery offering.  Here, wry wit and realism pop up in the most unexpected of placed.  To my mind, there is no story so great that a little humor can't make it even better.  \\"Noah's Ark\\" backs up this belief.<br /><br />We begin with the oddest of two page spreads.  On the left page, in the distance, we see an army marching away from a burning city.  Along the side of the road, men and cows have been indiscriminately slaughtered, and they lie in small pools of blood in a dead burnt field.  On the right page, Noah is tenderly harvesting his grapes.  A single shaft of light illuminates him and in the distance we see his house and livestock, awake, alive, and contented.  All the text says here is, \\"...But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord\\".  Thus begins our tale.  Slowly (and wordlessly) the ark is built.  Opposite a page where Noah's sons are loading up the ark with a host of necessary provisions (things like shoes, hoes, rakes, barrels of food, watering cans, etc.) is \\"The Flood\\" by Jacobus Revius (1586-1658).  Author Peter Spier has taken the liberty of translating this from the original Dutch, and the poem consists mostly of a listing of the kinds of creatures that boarded the ark.  This is the only explanation of plot the book contains.  From here on in, \\"Noah's Ark\\" is a wordless affair, reminiscent of the books of Anno.  We watch as animals are collected and gathered.  The floods rise and Noah & Co. deal with the little day-to-day problems of taking care of all the animals in the world.  Baby animals are born and, in the end, the ark stops atop a mountain and the world begins anew.  The final words in this story are placed against a scene of animals grazing once more under a beautiful rainbow in the sky.  As Noah works in the field it reads, \\"...and he planted a vineyard\\".  So it goes.<br /><br />The humor is evident right from the start.  I knew I was in good hands when I saw an imperial Noah shoo away a flock of bees from a hive.  Only two fly inside.  There's a donkey that refuses to be coaxed inwards as well.  Best of all, the shot of Noah mucking out the animals' stables (a large job in and of itself).  Spier chooses to separate his scenes with moments of quiet reflection.  A m&eacute;lange of animal and Noah pics is followed by a two page blue and white spread that contains a tiny silhouetted ark on the distant seas.  There are a couple sad moments in this book as well.  No child is going to enjoy the shot of the extraneous animals standing morosely outside the now full ark.  As the water rises the animals disappear from view, obviously drowned.  It's a touch dark.<br /><br />All in all, this is a fine piece of work.  There is a dearth of quality wordless picture books out there.  To find something as beautiful to look at and pleasurable to glance through as Spier's, \\"Noah's Ark\\", is a rare treat indeed.  All at once tender and detailed, colorful and creative, it's a sure fire favorite for any kid with a yen for a good story.  This book is certain to retain its status as beloved of adults and children alike.aced against a scene of animals grazing once more under a beautiful rainbow in the sky.

Since this impressive debut, Bear has gone on to appear in further Karma Wilson outings.  Yet it all began here, with a tale of hibernation and a friendly hootenanny of wild animals.<br /><br />A big brown bear, his teapot and other cave utensils strewn hither and yon, is hibernating in the winter.  Outside it is blustery and cold but (as we are repeatedly told), \\"The bear/ snores/ on\\".  One day a timid mouse enters the lair and lights himself a small fire for warmth.  No reaction from the snoring bear.  Soon a hare joins the mouse and they have a cup of tea.  No bearish interruptions.  Then there's a badger.  Then a mole, and a wren, and a raven, and a gopher.  In no time at all a full flown party is in swing, ending when a small fleck of pepper causes the bear to sneeze.  Suddenly he's awake and he's angry, but not for the reason you'd think.  No, Bear's just upset that everyone had a party without him.  But soon, the animals reassure the bear that the party can definitely continue with him, and their host entertains by telling them stories far into the night.  By morning everyone is fast asleep.  Except (oh irony) the bear.<br /><br />There's not much to the tale, honestly, but it's not the plot that's important.  Ms. Wilson has an ear for delightful cadences and rhyming sequences.  Just listen to the following sequence, \\"An itty-bitty mouse/pitter-pat, tip-toe/creep-crawls in the cave/from the fluff-cold snow\\".  I love how that (and every other) line scans.  Accompanying these deft syllables is the art of Jane Chapman.  With her guidance, the walls of the cave (illuminated by a crackling fire) glow a homey auburn.  Characters are both realistically rendered and adorably fuzzy.  I was particularly fond of a scene from out in the blustery snow where, looking into the cave, we see the black silhouettes of the dancing creatures against the yellow glow of the fire.  Color and texture are alive and well with this artist, I assure you.<br /><br />\\"Bear Snores On\\" isn't the MOST memorable of picture books, but its pleasant enough.  It's perfect for the child that is frightened easily (nothing bad happens, unless you count bear growling at one point) and gentle in its characterizations.  All in all, a class act all around.  If you need a good bedtime story to tuck the little ones in with, I highly recommend the electric boogaloo that is \\"Bear Snores On\\".llow glow of the fire.

I was very partial to \\"Uncle Andy's\\" when it came out last year, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.  And this is a real shame when you sit down to look at it.  Imagine, if you will, being related to one of the hippest New York artists working in the Pop Art scene.  James Warhola has taken one of his childhood experiences and woven it into a faabbbulous story about visiting his rather well known uncle, Andy Warhol.<br /><br />Living with his family in the countryside just a little ways from Pittsburgh, James Warhola always looked forward to the regular trips to Uncle Andy's.  James's father was Andy's eldest brother, and worked in a junkyard.  Always taking Andy a couple choice junk pieces, the family would pile into their station wagon and make the trip to visit Andy and their Grandmother Bubba.  Once there, Andy's home was a kid's dream house.  It was filled with crazy junk, pop art, and millions of different peculiar odds n' ends.  It had twenty-five cats (all named Sam), paint by number paintings, wigs, art, you name it.  Warhola goes on to recount some amusing problems that would arise from staying with Andy.  For example, Andy was prone to staying out late partying and then sleeping in.  One morning, James's little sister Maddie got tired of waiting for Andy to wake up so she walked right in.  The house was pierced with a shriek (on the part of Andy) when it was clear that he hadn't put his wig on yet.  James then goes on to explain that everyone in the family knew that Andy was bald, and that once Andy sent a box of his old wigs to his brother, allowing the family to goof around and try them all on.  In the end the family would usually leave in the early morning when Andy was asleep, but he'd always leave a box of gifts for the kids by the front door to take home with them.<br /><br />There's something so bizarre about this story that it makes perfect sense.  For anyone doubting the possibility that Andy Warhol (he dropped the extra \\"a\\" from the end of his name when he moved to New York) would have country nieces and nephews, you need only look at a photograph supplied on the back book flap.  There, beside two clean-cut early 1960s youngsters grins a devilish Andy Warhol, sunglasses and white wig intact.  The authenticity of the tale doesn't stop there, however.  Warhola has a wonderful sense of detail and intricacy that help him to tell his story well.  When little James wakes up in a makeshift bed (a door set atop four strategically placed paint cans) he finds himself in a room filled with junk, art, and scattered clothing.  There are Fantastic Four comic books and cats perched in every nook and cranny.  Every picture in this book has at least fifty different tiny details and moments in it that make it worth rereading again and again.<br /><br />So let's say you want to introduce your children to the great artists of the 20th century, but the last thing you want to do is to bore them.  \\"Uncle Andy's\\" is not only the perfect choice, it is the ONLY choice in many respects.  You can keep your Jasper Johns and Sally Manns to yourself.  I'm an Andy fan through and through.  And unlike other biographies of artists, this book is remarkable because it is:<br />a) A true story<br />b) A tale in the vein of \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  You know.  The mysterious proprietor and his amazing collection of wonders and marvels.<br />c) Well illustrated and well written.<br />There are other reasons to read this book to your kids (or to have them read it to you) but I think the ones I've listed should be sufficient.  There may have been only one Andy Warhol, but he was a heckuva uncle and friend to his nieces and nephews.  Take a little time to read something a little wild and I guarantee you'll enjoy it.

I always have a great deal of difficulty giving poor reviews to books that fill a need.  And I especially find it hard to give a tough review to a book that not only tells a tale about a boy of Latin American descent, but also won a coveted Pura Belpre Honor.  Nevertheless, I have to admit that I was unimpressed by author L. King Perez's foray into the world of children's picture books.  Though a well-meaning tale about standing up for one's self, the story is an overly familiar one and its packaging is nothing to write home about.<br /><br />Our hero is a boy named Chico.  Chico moves with his family up and down California as they pick fruits and vegetables to support themselves.  Now it is September when the grapes are ready to be picked and Chico is not particularly fond of the idea of going back to school.  He moves around quite a lot and is familiar with bullies and kids that tease him because he is different.  In this particular school, however, something changes.  His teacher likes him, he does particularly well in math, and he finds a way to deal with the bullies that he meets.  As the book flap says, \\"This story of personal triumph is a testament to the inner strength in all of us\\".  Well...sort of.<br /><br />The fact of the matter is, there's not a lot here that hasn't been hashed and rehashed in better books.  Want to read a story about a child that deals with some prejudices that are less obvious than the ones dealt with in this story?  Try finding A.F. Ada's, \\"My Name is Maria Isabel\\".  Like the idea of a child of migrant workers that finds strength in standing up to people without relying on violence?  Look at fellow Pura Belpre winner, \\"Harvesting Hope: The Story of Cesar Chavez\\" by Kathleen Krull.  These books have a style and wit all of their own, and they're well worth seeking out.  \\"First Day In Grapes\\"?  Not so much.<br /><br />Here were my problems with the book.  First of all (and there's no getting around it) the book's boring.  I'm sorry, but there it is.  Moments of tension aren't properly built up.  Accompanied by illustrator Robert Casilla's interesting but by and large mediocre pictures, the book has a kind of dragging feel.  Then there's the method by which Chico defeats his bullies.  I have little doubt that there are ways to outsmart such villains.  You'll just have to forgive me if I don't think shaming them with math skills is one of them.  The ending is a bit patchy, and more than a touch unbelievable.  I can hear people claiming that such a thing could happen.  And maybe in a better book I would have bought it.  But L. King Perez, while having an interesting story on her hands, hasn't sold it to the reader properly.<br /><br />My final call?  Some kids will dig this book, but most won't.  Its themes and ideas are so common in children's literature and picture books that I can say with almost absolute certainty that you will have minimal difficulty finding them in other better pieces of kiddie lit.  While I agree with almost every Pura Belpre Honor book there is, I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this one.  That's all.here it is.  Moments of tension aren't properly built up.

Sometimes a well-established author will be paired with an up-and-coming illustrator, and sometimes it's the other way around.  In an ideal situation, the text and the art compliment one another flawlessly, making it so that the reader finds it impossible to imagine any other pairing for that particular book.  If I had been Penny Pollock, I would have been initially overjoyed to learn that Ed Young had been selected to illustrate my work.  After all, Mr. Young is a winner of the prestigious Caldecott Medal.  His books include the beyond beautiful \\"Lon Po Po\\" as well as the technically adept and gorgeous \\"Seven Blind Mice\\".  Which makes it all the more painful that Ed essentially slept through the making of \\"The Turkey Girl\\".  While the book has a rather interesting and remarkable story, Young's illustrations look slapdash and amateurish.  This is a book that has been ruined by its pictures.  Worse still, it's been ruined by a formerly very talent artist.<br /><br />This Zuni tale is a kind of Cinderella story with a dour ending.  It tells the simple tale of a girl who lived in her village and was very poor.  Her only means of sustenance came from tending the turkeys of the rich, thereby earning her the moniker, Turkey Girl.  One day the Turkey Girl overhears that there is to be a fabulous harvest dance that everyone may attend.  The Turkey Girl understands that she hasn't the clothes or appearance for such an event, so she contents herself by telling her woes to her only friends, the turkeys.  To her amazement, however, the turkeys respond by talking to her.  Not the dumb birds we have taken them for, the turkeys present their mistress with a beautiful dress and jewelry for the dance.  They insist, however, that she return to them that night before the sun sets.  If she does not, they will fly far away and never return.  The Turkey Girl promises and goes off to join the dance.  She's a hit, but as the afternoon turns to evening she keeps putting off her return to the turkeys.  Finally she tears herself away, only to find that they've all gone and that her dress has been returned to rags.  As Pollack says in her Author's Note, this book (like some other Native American versions) ends with, \\"the hard truth that when we break our trust with Mother Earth, we pay a price\\".<br /><br />Though it's a little depressing in the end, I liked what this tale had to say.  The author has an excellent voice, and the scenes are beautifully presented through her narration.  Then we get to the pictures.  At first, I was captivated by Young's style.  Using pastel and oil crayon, Young works with colors that are native to the American Southwest (where this tale takes place).  Though a little fuzzy at first, I was more than willing to give Young the benefit of the doubt.  The fuzzy image of the Turkey Girl leading her charges out of the pueblo village looks as if we are viewing the scene through the wavy lines of heat you get on especially bright sunny days.  But as the book continued I realized that this style of drawing, while lovely, was completely misplaced here.  Though the action in the text becomes interesting and intense, the illustrations are static and without any detail at all.  In the section where the Turkey Girl goes to a spring and hears the other girls gossip (soon followed by the announcement of the dance), the picture shows a fuzzy white image of a girl perched on top of (why?) a pueblo as similarly fuzzy images walk away with pots of water on their heads.  The scene where the Turkey Girl receives a beautifully described dress of, \\"white doeskin...belted with red-and-yellow cloth\\", is accompanied by a shot of two or three somewhat grotesque turkeys taking up 1.25 pages.  Worst of all is the dance.  The closest we get to seeing ANYTHING at all is a washed out watery shot of eight or so legs that are, for all intents and purposes, not moving.  How hard would it have been for Young to infuse a little life into these pictures?  Or even, heaven forbid, a little detail.  The illustrator seems to be under the impression that to show any intricacies would be to betray the story itself.  If so, allow me to assure you Mr. Young that we would have been GLAD to read a book where in the event that a character does something...you see it!  Instead, a section that says that, \\"The Turkey Girl danced every dance, her heart beating in time with her stomping feet\\", is accompanied by a lazy-hazy view of slightly turkey-shaped clouds against a peach background.  If I have no patience for this, then I can guarantee that a five year old being read this story is definitely not going to have any patience with it either.<br /><br />Which is a real pity.  Though Pollock's tale is a bit dark and sad at the end (not only is the Turkey Girl tawdry once more but she's also out of a job) it could easily have worked beautifully with some well placed illustrations.  I just can't understand how Ed Young screwed this up.  Maybe he was really busy the month he was supposed to be drawing this.  Perhaps it didn't pique his interest.  Whatever the reason, this book looks like nothing so much as some rudimentary studies of Zuni color schemes hastily scrawled onto a series of pages.  If you'd like an adept and haunting Native American picture book fable, allow me to recommend, Rafe Martin's \\"The Rough-Face Girl\\".  An Algonquin (rather than Zuni) Cinderella tale, that book has the life and energy that this book lacks.  All I can say is that I feel very badly for Penny Pollock.  I hope that in the future she's given an illustrator that spends a little more time and energy on the final product.  For as much as I admire Ed Young, I cannot understand how he allowed himself to produce such a drab creation.  I guess it just happens to the best of us sometimes.  Maybe.not moving.

Good David Small books are usually (though by no means always) written AND illustrated by David Small himself.  Bad or poorly created David Small books are usually written by someone else, using Mr. Small's talents as a kind of afterthought.  The exception to this rule (and all rules, as you well know, must have exceptions) is the pairing of David Small and his wife Sarah Stewart.  After creating the fabulous \\"Money Tree\\" and the bibliophilic, but somewhat disturbing, \\"The Library\\", the two combined their talents yet again to write a gentle story of love, gardening, and family.<br /><br />The year: 1935, and Lydia Grace Finch is being sent from the country to go live with her Uncle Jim in the city.  Lydia Grace faces this challenge with resolve and a little sadness.  After all, she is leaving her family behind, the effects of the Great Depression having taken their toll.  The city is a gray dirty place and Uncle Jim is kind but he never smiles.  Soon, it's Spring again and Lydia has found a place to call her own (the building's abandoned roof).  Her number one goal is to get Uncle Jim to smile, and she's fairly certain that the answer to this goal is just around the corner.<br /><br />What Stewart and Small have accomplished here is an evocative sense of metropolitan dank and pastoral greenery.  The pictures are deeply moving sometimes, and gently humorous others.  One picture that particularly took by breath away was the shot of Lydia Grace standing in the train station alone.  She is singled out, a blue dress wearing, green hat donning, red-haired little girl.  The rest of the scene is all gray slashes of people walking in the distance and filthy light streaming through huge windows overhead.  It's a gorgeous picture.  Uncle Jim is just the right companion for the spunky little heroine too, looking like nothing so much as a 1930s version of Gene Shalit (sans the hair).  What I appreciated most about this story was that it accepted the fact that some people in this world express their emotions and feelings differently from others.  Not to give anything away, but Uncle Jim never smiles.  And you wouldn't want him to either.  Human beings can place importance in other things, like hard work and discipline.  Uncle Jim is one such person.<br /><br />If I have any objections to this book at all, it comes at the expense of Lydia Grace herself.  This is a wonderful character and a great gal, this is not a child.  David Small has, for reasons best known to himself, drawn a girl that looks like nothing so much as a shrunken adult.  I've never had this objection to any of Mr. Small's characters before, so it was a bit of a shock to me to have such an objection now.  Just the same, the eloquent story and excellent evocative scenes more than make up for a flaw that, let's admit it, probably only I could see.<br /><br />Gardeners get short shrift in books, especially books for kids (unless you count stories like, \\"The Carrot Seed\\").  In this particular case, I think anyone,regardless of whether or not they can tell a petunia from a tulip, will enjoy this book.  Its pace is a little slower and quieter than that found in other picture books, but for some kids it's just the right combination of simplicity and sweetness.about this story was that it accepted the fact that some people in this world express their emotions and feelings differently from others.

629999:US	49148452	RMRY4GT9K74OL	0375826688	342317933	Eragon (Inheritance)	Books	2	7	10	N	N	Somewhere we've all been before	The current marketing ploy gaining favor amongst publishers these days is the old \\"a teenage wrote this book\\" trick.  Books like \\"The Secret of the Stones\\", \\"Please Don't Kill the Freshmen\\", and \\"Eragon\\", have all hit the heights that they have because their authors are so doggone young.  Of the three I've just mentioned, \\"Eragon\\" is universally acknowledged to be the best written.  A fantasy of epic proportions I continually found myself cooing over writing styles and plot points that were remarkably well thought out for a fifteen year old.  Then I realized what I was doing.  What if I hadn't been aware of the author's age?  What if, instead, I had just picked this book off of the shelf and read it without any prior knowledge of the hype surrounding this first novel?  So I am going to pay Christopher Paolini a dubious honor.  Rather than review this book as if I was writing some dumbed down version of what I was actually thinking, I'm going to treat Mr. Paolini as I would a real author.  Criticism intact.<br /><br />\\"Eragon\\" is the tale of a boy and his dragon.  Living in a mythical land named Alagaesia, we meet our hero.  Eragon is fifteen going on sixteen and an excellent hunter.  Living with his uncle and cousin, one day he stumbles across a beautiful large blue stone.  It isn't long afterwards that he discovers that the stone is actually a dragon's egg, and the creature inside comes out to befriend him.  Named Saphira, the two become inseparable, and Eragon finds himself in the middle of a centuries long conflict.  The dragon Riders have long since disappeared, but Eragon's appearance means that there may be hope in defeating the evil King Galbatorix who rules Alagaesia with an iron hand.  Along the way Eragon befriends swordsmen, saves an elf from prison, and battles an evil being called a Shade.<br /><br />This is definitely somewhere we've been before.  That would be all right, though, if it didn't have so many other problems.  For one thing, there are some literary conceits here that I thought we'd moved past.  Let's examine the role of women in this book.  Every male character in this tale is ready and willing (if stout hearted and true) to fight.  Women, however, or generally weak.  When evil monsters threaten a hidden land, the women and children are taken away.  We do have two that remain to fight, but they're definitely not the norm.  Then there's the fact that no character in this story is allowed to have a living/breathing mother.  If you're under the age of 30, it's ten to one that your mother probably abandoned you or died when you were little.  Finally there's the small matter of names.  Now I'm sorry, but don't you consider it the slightest bit confusing that Eragon fights the Ra'zac with Zar'roc?  Just move the letters around for a little while.<br /><br />So the ideas are a little weak.  And the writing itself?  How well does the author weave a plot for children?  In many ways, his writing is adept.  If Paolini excels at anything, it's description.  Just read this:  \\"The second man had a florid face.  The skin around his jaw was dry and corpulent, filled with lumps of hard fat, like cold butter gone rancid\\".  Such eloquent passages pop up regularly, but description isn't everything.  The story of \\"Eragon\\", though derivative, is also prone to acts of extreme violence.  Babies are impaled on spikes.  A relative of our hero is subjected to cruel tortures.  There's even a threat of rape lobbied against one of the few females to grace the book's pages.  Though the author understands that you must convey the threat posed by the bad guys, he does so in a sometimes heavy manner.<br /><br />Finally, my favorite objection to this book.  It got to the point where I started keeping track of the times that Eragon went to sleep.  As it stands, the book is a hefty 497 pages of text.  Perhaps this could have been halved if Paolini hadn't decided to spell out every single time Eragon beds down.  Of direct references alone(not moments alluded to, though there were plenty of those as well) I counted 19.  If you want to have some fun, read the first sentence of the 4th, 12th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 23rd, 27th, 29th, 31st, 34th, 35th, 36th, 38th, 39th, 41st, 45th, 48th, 52nd, 54th, 56th and 57th chapters.  I've never witnessed a character that did so much waking up.  Even more fun was counting the number of times Eragon is knocked unconscious.  A book reviewer once commented that you can sometimes tell how good a book is by how many times its hero is knocked out.  This is usually a literary technique that allows the lazy writer the chance to move from one scene to another without a lot of exposition.  \\"Eragon\\" contains at least six such moments.  Six.<br /><br />So the book isn't the best written in the world, no.  Just the same, I can see plenty of parents eagerly purchasing it for their kiddies.  There's violence, but few adults monitor this kind of material in stories.  If I've seemed a little mean in this review, I'm sorry.  I think Christopher Paolini has a lot of talent.  I do!  I just think he should start using that talent to write something a little more original.  There is some comfort in the fact that as he ages, his writing will probably mature.  Unfortunately, we have to witness the stages he's going through until it does.  My advice to the man is this: Ease up on the Tolkein, and shy away from the Star Wars.  Try not to foreshadow things too intensely (if the reader doesn't figure out who the Varden spy is by the end of the book, they'd have to have been reading the book backwards).

630408:US	49148452	R9SSDP1AEPEPP	0688162800	73097514	Molly's Pilgrim (Customized Book Bundles)	Books	4	49	51	N	N	The wonderful book that brought me down low	Ladies and gentlemen, I come before you today with a confession.  I, knowingly and without malice, am a wimp.  I am a wimp of the finest pedigree, forged in the wimpy steps of my wimpy forebears.  This loathsome quality only cares to show itself in the oddest of moments.  Normally, I feel relatively safe reading children's books and, especially, picture books.  Certainly the protagonists in these tales have their trials and tribulations to endure, but they usually do so with relative good faith and their enemies are by and large trampled soundly at the end of their tales.  Usually.  Then there are books like, \\"Molly's Pilgrim\\".  Ladies and gentlemen, if your child can read through this book in its entirety without feeling overwhelmed by a sense of misery and woe then they're a stronger man or woman than I.<br /><br />In this classic tale, a little girl named Molly is having problems at school.  Her classmates tease her relentlessly, usually making fun of her funny accent and supposed un-American ways.  Molly, you see, immigrated to this country with her mother and father from Russia.  Jewish in faith, they originally lived in New York City, but now Molly's father has found steady employment in Winter Hill.  Here, Molly is the only Jewish girl around, and she suffers mightily at the hands of the other girls.  One day, Molly's teacher, Miss Stickley, decides that the class is going to do something a little different for Thanksgiving this year.  Each child will design a pilgrim or an Indian for a little diorama and present it to the class.  Molly is assigned a pilgrim, and she eagerly tells the assignment to her mama.  Her mother, however, listens to the description of what a pilgrim is (someone seeking religious freedom and a life free from persecution) and creates a doll that is a small Russian immigrant.  Of course, the other kids at school deride this idea of a pilgrim, until Miss Stickley explains that Molly's doll is perhaps the most appropriate of all.  After all, the very idea of Thanksgiving is based on the Jewish harvest holiday of Tabernacles, and unlike any other student in the room, Molly is the real pilgrim.<br /><br />I have absolutely no problems with this story.  I mean, how can you not like it?  And how many adults, if you stopped them on the street today, would be able to tell you what Jewish holiday the pilgrims, that came to our land, based Thanksgiving on?  Few, I suspect.  Molly is an incredibly sympathetic character, and that's probably where my own problems stem from.  After all, there's a significant lack of comeuppance in this tale.  Molly suffers relentless teasing and problems from other children her age, but that's never really resolved.  The evil Elizabeth is never reprimanded for her actions, nor even made to think twice about treating Molly like a human being.  Instead, she's nasty from page one until the end and stays that way.  Which, honestly, was probably the best way to go.  I mean, vengeance doesn't really have a place in children's picture books, does it?  But how hard would it have been for Elizabeth to get what's coming to her?  Even a little?<br /><br />What I had a hard time with in this story was Molly's pain.  Barbara Cohen describes it beautifully, and we've plenty of gorgeous illustrations by Michael J. Deraney (if that's the version you're purchasing) showing Molly huddled in misery on a swing, running with tears in her eyes from the girls, crying on her Mama's chest, dreading entering her school building, and miserably hiding her doll when other children mock it.  It's a lovely book, but distinctly and incredibly painful for me and, I suspect, for certain types of children.  For some, however, this book will be a kind of balm.  They will see that they are not alone in being teased by other kids, and that Molly suffers just as they suffer.<br /><br />The story is excellent.  The illustrations superb.  The moral, unequivocal.  If you would like an excellent tale to tell around the Thanksgiving season, you really couldn't find one better.  Just be aware of what you're getting yourself into ahead of time.  It's a great book, but for some people a distinctly depressing one.g season, you really couldn't find one better.

The friend allowed them to sleep in his bedroom, and there on the shelf was the infamous Judy Blume book, \\"Forever\\".  Remembering the whispers and rumors surrounding the novella, the boys immediately snatched it up and tried to discover its secrets.  Says my husband now, \\"I had thought in Middle School that the government had banned the book.  That it was an officially banned book\\".  It was, after all, the most sought after of all the forbidden works out there.  After flipping through (and locating the sexy passages)the boys were a bit disappointed and perplexed.  There's nothing particularly shockig in this book.  From the hype it receives you'd think it was a slightly modified version of \\"The Story of O\\".  Instead, what you have is a well-written story concerning the course of a single relationship and the consequences of young love.<br /><br />Katherine is in love with Michael.  And Michael is in love with Katherine.  As we read, the book follows their growing trust, from their early tentative days, to a growing dependence, to their final words together.  Katherine's life is easier than most.  She has two wonderfully caring parents, a talented younger sibling, and a wise-in-the-ways-of-the-world grandmother who always gives her good advice.  Katherine is eighteen years of age, and privy to all the advantages and problems that such an age entails.  Just the same, she understands that her relationship with Michael is special and different.  No one is going to keep them from loving one another.  Except possibly themselves.<br /><br />To be honest, I have a hard time figuring out why teens enjoy this book as much as they do (apart from the sex).  To me, the adult reader, Katherine is consistently remarking that adults like her parents don't understand her situation or that they're needlessly thoughtless and uncaring.  Any reader with a lick of sense will notice that Katherine's assessments are, like many teens', skewed by emotion.  She IS rather innocent in the ways of the world.  Fortunately, one of Blume's hallmarks is that she remains a distinctly understanding writer.  Being young and hormonally screwed up does not mean that your average young adult is incapable of making thoughtful intelligent decisions.  This idea is part of the reason Blume's books are banned as often as they are.  I mean, honestly, let's consider \\"Forever\\" today.  At this moment in time there are teen books out there named things like, \\"Doing It\\", that are far more graphic and sexually liberated than the relatively tame \\"Forever\\".  These books (appealing in large part towards young male audiences) have proliferated like mad and are particularly obsessed with sex rather than love.  In this light \\"Forever\\" is almost an innocent ing&eacute;nue.  It is certainly one of the first books to have spokenly openly about teen sexuality, but why is it still being banned in certain schools and libraries today?  Personally, I suspect that it has to do in large part with the fact that it is dealing with a GIRL's sexual feelings.  Books about boys and sex are as old as the hills themselves.  But put a book like this with a female narrator and her friends discussing getting laid with all the frankness and intelligence they are capable of... well friends, that's a heap o' trouble for a lot of folks.  In an interesting side note, the more recently published copies of \\"Forever\\" have included a note by author Judy Blume discussing sex, and how the face of sexuality has changed since the advent of AIDS.  She even goes so far as to include contact information to Planned Parenthood.  And when you consider that the grandmother in this tale works for that self same institution, there's little doubt left that Blume's a gutsy gal.  Plenty o' adults will bristle at the very thought of giving kids that much information.  Plenty more will approve.<br /><br />As you can see, if nothing else \\"Forever\\" is a great book for starting discussions with teens about sex.  But I'd be dishonest if I said that was the focus of the book.  It's not.  The book is about relationships in general.  How they grow, how they change, and how they end.  After all, the title of this tale wasn't (the aforementioned) \\"Doing It\\", but the wistful \\"Forever\\".  It's a promise that no one should ever be held to while young.  As for people who want to dislike this book based solely on its content, nothing I write here is going to change their minds that this book isn't the spawn of Satan, a corrupting influence, should be in the adult section of the library, etc.  For as long as there are talented writers like Judy Blume out there (and let us hope that it's for a very long time) there will be complaints by overprotective adults.  Just read through \\"Forever\\" before you judge it.  You may be shocked to discover that it's a rather tame ride into the heart of the American teen.> <BR>As you can see, if nothing else \\"Forever\\" is a great book for starting discussions with teens about sex.

After creating a series of deft and meaningful illustrations for Kathleen Krull's heartfelt Cesar Chavez picture book, \\"Harvesting Hope\\", she wrote and illustrated a second 2003 Pura Belpre winner.  \\"Just a Minute\\" is both a trickster tale and a basic counting story.  Taking the dark conceit of outwitting death through meticulous partying, the story is a delightful dance with the macabre.<br /><br />It is Grandma Beetle's birthday, and a most unexpected guest is at the door.  Standing as nice as you please is Senor Galavera.  The handsome skeleton informs the older woman that it is just about time for her to go away with him.  Grandma Beetle delays him, asking to have time to sweep her ONE house.  Then she has TWO pots of tea to boil.  Next, it's THREE pounds of corn to make into tortillas.  As more and more time goes by the previously patient Senor Galavera becomes more and more impatient.  Finally, it's party time and the finicky skeleton finds that he's had so much fun that he'll be sure to come back for Grandma Beetle's birthday at the same time next year.<br /><br />Who can resist the idea of outwitting Death himself through a simple counting game?  Better still, for every English number pronounced there's a Spanish one for easy translation.  But as fine an author as Ms. Morales is, she's an even better illustrator.  First of all, Senor Galavera is a fabulous site.  Anyone familiar with a skeleton from the Day of the Dead will appreciate his appearance.  Sporting a jaunty fedora and a delicately detailed body, he's really quite attractive.  His mouth is a series of blue and orange alternating stripes.  His eyes are the stars of the anise seed.  Better yet, along his vertebrate, forearms, forehead, and kneecaps are tiny intricate details.  Grandma Beetle is more than a match for this supposedly dire apparition.  She's even able to coerce him into donning an apron (falling loosely on his bony hips) and mixing some pots of delicious food.  Kids reading through this book several times will enjoy locating the sly kitten that follows our two heroes about from page to page.  To my mind, the best part of these pictures is their luminosity.  They pulsate with the deep blues, greens, reds, and other shades that line the pages.  \\"Just a Minute\\" has rapidly become my number one favorite illustrated picture book of the year 2003 (outside of my beloved \\"Diary of a Wombat\\" that is).  A book that intrigues, teaches, and is filled with a deep emotional warmth such as this book has is a rare find.  Be sure to read it and then share it with everyone you know.food.

634112:US	49148452	R1AXZR7KCK9F7F	0380977788	425362981	Coraline	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Down a dark hall	Everyone seems to have a clear idea in their heads about what kids do and do not want and what kids should and should not want.  There are experts out there that will quote you statistics and parents who will tell you exactly what their children are NOT allowed to read.  I am not an expert in the area of emotional and intellectual growth of children, nor (to come clean) am I a parent.  All my expertise regarding kids comes from my own not-so-long-ago experience as one.  I remember reading the books that I was told were trash and despicable.  Remember the \\"Scary Stories To Tell In the Dark\\" series?  Loved it.  Badly written Apple paperbacks that had titles like, \\"Ghost Cat\\"?  Loved `em.  And had the book \\"Coraline\\" been written in my youth I would have loved it very dearly as well.  Far better written than the books I've already mentioned, the tale is almost certain to be banned, denounced, and derided by overprotective critics.  And it's well worth the publicity, I assure you.<br /><br />Part \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" with a heaping helpful of Roald Dahl thrown in, the story follows our heroine, Coraline.  She's just moved into a big house with her parents. The house is so large, in fact, that Coraline's family only occupies the middle level of the building.  A slightly daft old man obsessed with mice lives on the top floor, and two ladies (once women of the stage) occupy the lower level.  Coraline likes nothing better than to wander around the grounds of her new home, meeting the local stray cat, and viewing the old abandoned (and boarded up) well.  One day she finds the day to be a dank drizzly one.  There's nothing much to do inside, but a useless door in the parlor that leads only to a brick wall catches her eye.  One day, when her parents are out, Coraline opens the door only to find that instead of a brick wall, there's a long dark hallway.  And at the end of the hallways is a house exactly like her own.  And there's her father and her mother...but different.  For you see, this father and mother have buttons instead of eyes, and can promise to give Coraline everything she's ever wanted.  In no time at all, it becomes very clear that Coraline is in direst peril, and that her very soul is being threatened.<br /><br />This synopsis sort of hints at the dank disgusting things found in the story, but I'm unable to convey them properly.  The millions of children that read this will identify with Coraline intrinsically.  She's interested in things that are a little different.  She wants to be original and apart, but her mother and father are only able to give her the things that all good parents try to give.  Love, support, and a sense of stability.  The book is especially excellent at drilling a couple moral lessons home (lessons that I suspect some adults should read and make note of).  These include: 1. Being brave isn't just doing something courageous.  It's doing something courageous when you're afraid and you don't want to do it.  2.  Kids want a lot of stuff but not really.  What kids really want are boundaries and limits, so that they know that their parents love them.  There are other lessons as well, but these are the ones that stick out in my mind.<br /><br />The best way of recommending the book to you is to show you the quote that begins it.  It reads...<br /><br />\\"Fairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten\\", - G.K. Chesterton.<br /><br />Please don't read this tale and assume the proverbial dragons in it are going to be interpreted by children as existing.  Instead, understand that books like this prove to kids that their deepest nightmares and fears can be beaten if they just use their heads and act intelligently.  \\"Coraline\\" is worthy of all praise I can give it.  What other book has blurbs on its back from Diana Wynne Jones, Terry Pratchett, AND Lemony Snicket?  Many children out there that are drawn to scary stories and frightening tales will love this story.  For everyone else, they can just snuggle up with their \\"Princess Diaries\\" and avoid anything complicated or intellectually challenging.  And a final word?  This book will probably scare the pants off of anyone who reads it.  It's just that good.l love this story.  For everyone else, they can just snuggle up with their \\"Princess Diaries\\" and avoid anything complicated or intellectually challenging.  And a final word?

Newbery winners are a touch and go lot, and a lot of kids avoid them like the plague.  I've always been particularly interested in those award winning books that appeal to kids just as much as they appeal to the adults that shower them with praise, moolah, and awards.  For instance, many adults felt that the book \\"A Single Shard\\" was well written, while a host of kids looked on it as dulldy dull dull.  Both children and adults have agreed that \\"Holes\\" and \\"The Tale of Despereaux\\" are great books that are fun to read.  Then you come to \\"The View From Saturday\\".  Honestly, I thought this was a fabulous book.  It was the rare children's novella that took the great risk of offering wisdom to its readers.  It dares to make you think about life, the world, and how one interacts with other people.  I can tell you a million reasons to love it, but I honestly haven't a clue if kids would enjoy it.  Therein lies the mystery.<br /><br />\\"The View From Saturday\\" follows the lives of four sixth grade quiz bowl champs and their paraplegic coach/teacher.  Alternating their final quiz bowl championship match with short stories about the different journeys each kid has had to make, the book is adept at distinguishing between each individual in the group. We begin by listening to a story told by Noah.  Noah reminded me of nothing so much as the spaz boy in the spelling bee documentary \\"Spellbound\\".  A bit of a nerd, but pleased with his own inventive thoughts and ideas, Noah becomes the best man at a geriatric wedding.  Then we hear Nadia's story about staying with her divorced father and newly remarried grandfather (hence the Noah connection) in Florida.  This flows nicely into Ethan's story.  His grandmother married Nadia's grandfather, and he overcomes his reluctance to interact easily with others with the help of his new friend Julian.  Julian is the least troubled of the bunch, a boy of Indian heritage who is coming to America after living on a cruise ship.  Together, the four band together into a group called The Souls.  They are selected by Mrs. Olinski (though for a long time she doesn't know why) as her newest Quiz Bowl team and work effortlessly together in a group as friends and teammates.<br /><br />A synopsis of this tale really doesn't do it justice.  Konigsburg is an adept writer and she knows exactly how to balance a story with both emotion and humor.  I was particularly taken with Nadia's tale about living in Florida.  Somehow, the author was able to conjure up feelings of being ignored and abandoned perfectly.  As Nadia feels an (in my opinion) entirely justified sense of self-pity, we as readers understand what she's going through perfectly.  Little triumphs are measured with small defeats.  One of the things this book dares to say, and says so well, is how awfully mean people can be.  That's a pretty loaded idea.  Books today enjoy showing a mean person and then revealing the back story to their crimes.  Here, we understand that sometimes a person's just mean to be mean, and it makes them unsuitable as friends as a result.<br /><br />Then there's Konigsburg's usual jabs at adults in positions of authority.  In this particular case she's aimed her sights at people who naturally expect themselves to be smarter than children, yet constantly make mistakes regarding multiculturalism, grammar, pronunciation, etc.  And she doesn't drill this idea home by ever putting the adults in situations where they spar with the kids.  Instead, they tend to spar with Mrs. Olinski, assuming that because she is a) Just a teacher and b) Confined to a wheelchair she must therefore be less worthy of intelligent human discourse.  The result is usually both funny and profound.<br /><br />Funny and profound is a good way to describe this entire offering, actually.  It has its oddities, that's for sure.  You have kids in this book saying sentenceslike, \\"Oh, that is too bad. Dad is picking me up before supper, and he will be disappointed if I do not eat with him\\".  Not a contraction in sight.  Do sixth graders actually act like the ones in this book?  Probably not.  Will you be amused by them anyway?  Probably so.  Will actual living breathing sixth graders be amused, intrigued, and challenged by this book?  I have absolutely no idea.  Maybe yes, maybe no.  Whether or not they will, the book is fabulous, fun, and wise beyond its years.  It's like a little dose of Zen religion without hokey mysticism or flowery prose.  This book respects you, it respects your opinions, and it respects your sense of self-worth.  If you have any desire to read something that accomplishes all this and more, pick it up for a glance.Oh, that is too bad.

Take a gander at Margot's excellent \\"It Could Always Be Worse\\".  Thrill to Harve's \\"The Liar\\", complete with shocking ending.  Then come back to the 1974 Caldecott winning \\"Duffy and the Devil\\".  After reading the first two, you will understand perfectly how the Zemachs used their considerable skills and talents to bring to the world a wide variety of fabulous folktales.  In this particular concoction our authorial duo offer unto us a retelling of the old Rumplestiltskin story.  The result is charming.<br /><br />In Cornwall there was once a rich Squire by the name of Lovel of Trove.  He lived with his ancient housekeeper, a woman so old she was unable to properly mend and knit her employer's clothing.  One day, the Squire sets out to find another housekeeper when he hears a local woman berating a girl because she is shiftless and lazy.  The girl, Duffy, is immediately hired by the Squire (who apparently isn't put on guard by her reputed sloth) and the two go to his home.  When confronted with her duties, the lazy Duffy somehow finds a way to destroy the only sewing machine.  Uttering an oath, she is quickly joined by a little three-foot tall devil.  The devil informs the girl that he will do all her chores and after three years he will take her away with him.  That is unless, of course, she guesses his name within those three years.  Duffy is a careless sort, and she readily agrees.  The clothes the devil makes are fabulous and after a while the Squire and Duffy wed.  When the time comes to pay the devil's due, Duffy panics and finds she cannot discover his name.  With a little help from Old Jone, the older servant, the problem is solved and everyone is able to get back to things the way they used to be.<br /><br />Don't you love picture books that some people hate for no good reason?  I will now draw your attention to the fact that this story uses one little motif that sets the good Christian conservatives of the world on their ear faster than anything.  It shows a little devil.  Not THE devil, mind you.  Just an underling.  The story also shows a bunch of witches dancing about the fire.  Now, what I like about all of this is that these characters are clearly evil, and the devil himself is destroyed at the end of the tale.  But some people will not be appeased.  They will lobby cries of \\"Satanism!\\" and \\"Evil\\" against this poor little picture book.  Better still, they'll insist that elements of this tale (based, no less, on a popular Cornish play performed in the nineteenth century) be changed.  That the author should have taken out the devil.  Such suggestions are as ill advised as they are innocently insulting.  There is nothing perverse or bad about this story.  But if you feel it would be an evil presence in your home then by all means avoid it.<br /><br />It is a good story, though.  Not only are the words well recorded but the pictures are a stitch.  The devil is a plump fellow with a tale that's longer and grosser than any rat's.  I was particularly impressed that illustrator Margot Zemach understands the logistics of spinning wheels.  Here marks the second picture book I've ever seen that shows how spinning wheels actually work (the first being Paul O. Zelinsky's elegant \\"Rumplestiltskin\\").  The casual reader might point out that, in a way, Duffy is rewarded for her laziness.  That's one possible interpretation.  Another might be to add that this book is potentially a comment on the idle rich.  Industrious workers like the old servant remain in their station while the lazy cheaters join the hoity toity ranks of other lazy cheaters.  Such is the way of the world.  Another way to look at this book is to simply give it the due offered to so many fairy tales out there.  After all, we've never objected to the ending of the real Rumpelstiltskin, have we?  So how is this story any different?  That's just my take.<br /><br />In the end, the book's a fun romp.  Kids will be just as amused by the feisty little devil as they will by the Squire loosing all this clothing in the end (making careful use of his top hat, I might add).  If you care for a good folktale told with the appropriate amount of fun and ridiculousness, look no further than \\"Duffy and the Devil\\".  It's an adorable concoction./>In the end, the book's a fun romp.

As an author, Rylant has penned books that speak to the quiet still voice in all of us.  Her, \\"When I Was Young In the Mountains\\" is a delicate return to the Appalachia of her youth.  More recently her, \\"God Went to Beauty School\\" gives us a book that is both succinct and grandiose.  With these works (and many others) in mind I decided to take a gander at her early reader series starring the irascible Henry and his sweet natured St. Bernard (or so I assume him to be) Mudge.<br /><br />In this, the second book in the \\"Henry and Mudge\\" series, we follow our intrepid duo through three bite sized adventures.  In \\"Snow Glory\\", it's Spring and Henry has fallen head over heels in love with a small blue flower that has bloomed.  Though his mother tells him not to pick it, Henry is entranced by the plant and confesses this love to his dog.  Unfortunately, Mudge listens intently to Henry and then proceeds to devour the plant.  Initially angry, Henry understands that it is necessary to forgive his pet and the two continue companionably.  In the second tale, \\"Puddle Trouble\\", Henry forgets to inform his father that he and Mudge are going puddle jumping in the wet April weather.  When his pop comes looking for the two, his intentions are not as dire as they may first appear.  Finally, the third tale in this collection, \\"The Kittens\\", is for me the best written of the bunch.  The cat who lives next door to Henry and Mudge has kittens, and the two friends have a great deal of fun watching the sweet little balls of fur play.  The neighbors like to put the kittens in a box on the porch in the sun to give the mama cat some time to rest.  Mudge is greatly attached to the little creatures, and when he suspects that they are threatened, he retaliates in a fashion unseen until now in the series.<br /><br />Each story in this collection deals with a serious topic, lightly told and playfully presented.  The first is about forgiving people for being themselves.  The second informs people to act responsibly and, when appropriate, irresponsibly too.  The third, my personal favorite, is about finding hidden reserves of strength.  Mudge is such a lovable clumsy fellow that for most of the book he's featured as a happy-to-lucky kind of pup.  When he sees something he loves threatened, however, he reacts with a great deal of self-possession.  Accompanying Rylant's sly tales are Sucie Stevenson's illustrations.  Admittedly, I can take or leave these pics.  They're certainly lighthearted and fun and they get the story across without difficulty.  Just the same, it might have been nice to give these tales a little more depth or feeling.  So thought I until I saw the last illustration.  After the kittens have been threatened and a potentially dangerous dog has left the premises there is an excellent shot of Mudge with his paws protectively around the sides of the kittens' box.  His head is down but he looks completely alert and ready, in case of further trouble.  It's an image that stays with you.<br /><br />Good clean fun sums up the \\"Henry and Mudge\\" series fairly well.  But what separates these books from other series like \\"Junie B. Jones\\" or \\"Cam Jansen\\" is their moral core.  Rylant has given these books some heart and a little soul.  In a series, this is extraordinary.  For an author of Rylant's skill, however, it's just to be expected.<br />Each story in this collection deals with a serious topic, lightly told and playfully presented.

To the bafflement of most of the knowledgeable children's literature world, \\"Ella Sarah Gets Dressed\\" garnered itself the prestigious and highly sought after Caldecott Honor Award in early 2004.  It beat such potential contenders as Peter Sis's, \\"Tree of Life\\" and Gerald McDermott's, \\"Creation\\", both far worthier (in my humble opionion) winners.  This isn't to say that the book is bad.  As a charming tale about a stubborn toddler and her intense desire to wear the clothing of her own choice, the book is sweet and good-natured.  Just the same, I was amazed by its reception.<br /><br />As far as the plot goes, it's fairly basic.  Ella Sarah plods around the house in her sheep pajamas, a floppity stuffed animal (with the nose and mouth of a martini glass) accompanying her wherever she goes.  Right from the start, our heroine knows exactly what kind of clothing she would like to wear.  Says she, \\"I want to wear my pink polka-dot pants, my dress with orange-and-green flowers, my purple-and-blue striped socks, my yellow shoes, and my red hat\\".  Her mother complains that the outfit is too dressy.  She suggests an alternative, which is met with Ella Sarah's reiterated desire.  Her father says it's too fancy and she repeats her outfit (this time accompanied by a very realistic tantrumesque stamping on the floor).  Her older sister says it's too silly and offers some clothes she's outgrown.  Now the stuffed animal goes flying, as Ella Sarah proclaims her perfect outfit for the last time.  Carefully she dresses herself in the colorful eclectic ensemble.  When the doorbell rings we see that her friends are just as snazzy as our intrepid heroine.  And with that, the four friends sit down to tea and donut holes.  It is a colorful sight.<br /><br />Cute plot all right, but it's the illustrations that really take your breath away.  Using a kind of paper cutout style (the publication page is a little unclear about this, content to merely call the process, \\"a variety of printmaking techniques\\") everyone is presented with a series of rounded colorful forms.  We never see the heads of Ella Sarah's parents or older sibling, which makes perfect sense.  After all, we're on a toddler's level with this book.  No surprise there.  Especially enjoyable are the printed backgrounds that make up the wallpaper, bedspreads, and rugs in this story.  As for the outfit Ella Sarah eventually dons, it's a pip.  If there is an award winning moment in this book then it is the two-page spread of the protagonist doffing a bright red hat.  The hat is not only colorful, but also tilted at a rakish angle.  It's just a quick moment of kiddie noir before we're back to the usual story.<br /><br />Kids reading this tale will be inspired by it.  It has the capacity to not only send a message like, \\"Just be yourself\\" but to also encourage kids to learn how to dress themselves.  And heck, any kid with a wardrobe like Ella Sarah and her friends will probably want to learn how to dress forthwith.  As you can see, this is a darling tale.  It's not the most inspired or original in the world, but it has a very particular knack and charm to it that's adorable.  A tale that will entice not only the parents of the world, but their kids as well.ues\\") everyone is presented with a series of rounded colorful forms.

Says Shah, \\"It is quite usual to find collections of tales arranged according to language or country\\".  One need only scan their local library to prove that this is indeed the case.  Books like this abound.  Far less common, however, are books that acknowledge the similarities between different stories around the world.  We are all familiar, on one level or another, of the different types of Cinderella stories found in every culture from Vietnam to Scotland.  Less well known are stories like \\"The Bird Maiden\\" found in \\"The Arabian Nights\\" and told amongst some Southern American Indians.  Collector Idries Shah marvels at the extraordinary connections between different cultures held together by similar stories.  How did these stories get around as widely as they did?  Is there some innate connection between all human beings that allows them to make up similar tales?  As if in answer, Shah has used his thirty-five years of experience working with written and oral sources to present sixty-five tales.  Each tale can be found in several different cultures with slight variations.  Yet in spite of their subtle differences, each story is undoubtedly related to another, a fact that may give you reason enough to pause.<br /><br />Originally published in 1979, the book is not without some factors that date it.  I am referring, of course, to its accompanying illustrations.  For the most part, these are lush lavish affairs.  Having read portions of this book as a child, certain images presented here have effectively embedded themselves in my tiny brain for years and years.  I could recall perfectly the vision of Death rising from its fig bottle prison, the Gollum-like Ghoul that crouches in a tree, or even the image of Psyche on the rocks approached by Cupid.  Looking at it now, however, I was a little shocked by some extremely dated illustrations here and there.  In a tale called \\"The Traveling Companion\\" a picture that looks like nothing so much as a poorly airbrushed rock n' roll cover (complete with a hot winged babe) accompanies the story.  In \\"Catherine's Fate\\" (a tale I love because it involved the conceit of deciding whether the first half or second half of your life should be the happiest) we see an odd MTV-like scene that looks like it's part Poltergeist part Exorcist.  You get the picture.  Fortunately, even the most ludicrous illustrations in this tale are still gorgeous and worth at least a glance.  Utilizing the talents of some 37 illustrators, these tales get the attention they so greatly deserve.<br /><br />Each tale in this book is preceded by a small explanation of its history, its meaning, and where you can find it throughout the world.  Shah is good about citing his sources, for the most part.  After reading his version of \\"The Algonquin Cinderella\\" I was amazed at its similarities to Rafe Martin's picture book, \\"The Rough-Face Girl\\", down to almost every word.  Both obviously drew upon the same sources, but since neither has gone so far as to say EXACTLY what that source was, we the readers are left somewhat in the dark.  Just the same, this isn't a scholarly work that requires footnotes, endnotes, and a fifty-page long bibliography.  In many ways, this is a book written merely for the enjoyment and wonder of child and adult readers alike.<br /><br />There is nothing in this collection that will displease you.  Though a collection of tales and fables, children may be a little bored at the longer stories that are not accompanied by constant pictures and illustrations.  Certain tales in this book have been already translated into picture book form anyway.  \\"The Rough-Face Girl\\" is one version, and \\"Seven Blind Mice\\" is a take on this book's, \\"The Blind Ones and the Matter of the Elephant\\".  In short, the book is really meant to be read by discerning adults.  If you're able to seek out and purchase a copy of this collection, I highly recommend it.  Well worth the price, this is an excellent compendium of the best stories the world knows well.

Name the best-known Japanese picture book author/illustrator read in the United States today!  Give up?  Well due to the fact that you've decided to look up a review of a book by the ever-popular Mitsumasa Anno, you've probably guessed the answer with minimal difficulty.  Yes, Anno is the man I mean.  Best known, perhaps, for his intriguing wordless books (highly recommended) the author's focus has shifted dramatically with this intriguing retelling of Aesop's classic tales.  Creating a book that is as original as it is faithful to its sources, \\"Anno's Aesop\\" is a complex interweaving of text and reinterpretation.<br /><br />To begin, we are told a story of little Freddy Fox.  Running through the woods one day he stumbles across a book of Aesop's fables.  After presenting this book to his father he yearns for the stories to be read to him.  We are given the distinct impression that Mr. Fox doesn't know how to read, but he's not about to lose face in front of his son.  The result is that Mr. Fox gives his own unique spin on the pictures that follow.  As the book progresses we are given 2 stories (usually) per tale.  At the top of the page, amid the illustrations, is the actual Aesop fable, complete with moral.  At the bottom of the same page is Mr. Fox's tale.  His versions are usually concerned primarily with small details that aren't readily apparent with the story's first telling.  Therefore, a story about the goose that laid the golden egg and whose picture contains a cat is suddenly (in the Fox's version) in his version all about the feline.  Children reading these fables are given a choice of either believing that one tale is superior to the other or that they are both possible interpretations of Anno's cleverly detailed illustrations.<br /><br />The book may be a little confusing at first, but once the reader (and the children) get into it, it's a lot of fun.  Mr. Fox is obviously clueless about a vast majority of the stories, and sometimes it takes some gentle nudging by his son to remember that he's supposed to be \\"reading\\" these tales.  As for the tales themselves, Mr. Anno has meticulously researched and translated quite a few of them.  An Editor's Note in the back of the text tells us that for some of the more obscure stories, Anno relied on books that were a little harder to find.  These sources are cited for further reading by adults, if they so chose.  Additionally, the book has some factual information about the man known as Aesop, including details on his life and even his death.  As for the illustrations in the book itself, fans of Anno's other works will find only one picture that resembles books like \\"Anno's Journey\\".  Unlike his other books, we see some fine details and facial expressions here.  It is obvious that Mitsumasa Anno is a better artist that he'd ever like to let on.  And we are the ones who benefit from his talents.<br /><br />Altogether, the book is almost postmodern in its take on tales and the relation a reader has to illustrations in a text.  Says Anno himself, \\"a child who cannot yet read words can still learn many valuable things by thinking creatively about what he or she sees in the pictures in this book, just as Freddy Fox does\\".  Anyone interested in the fate of illustrations and how picture images are changed in the mind of the reader should take extra care to read this book sometime in their travels.  Advanced enough to be pondered by adults, and amusing enough to be enjoyed by children, this book treads the fine line between what parents expect a book to provide and what kids want in their literature.

The amount of picture books told solely in photos today is slim at best.  No photographic picture book has ever won the coveted Caldecott Award.  No photographic picture book has even so much as made itself into its own specific genre.  Much as photographs are given short shrift in art galleries (there are those that claim its very mechanics keep it from attaining the status of \\"true art\\"), photos are also fairly ignored as a medium through which to tell tales to children.  Working to remedy this problem, photographers Carl R. Sams II and his wife Jean Stoick have captured a series of winter pictures taken in the wilds of either Canada or the upper Midwest.  Yet while these photographs are stunning as a whole, the text fails to live up to its potential.<br /><br />The book begins like so:  \\"The snowflakes were resting after their twisting twirling dance through the crisp night air\\".  The reader is privy to a beautifully white clad snowscape, every tree and bush covered in a thick coat of winter snow.  As we watch, animals call to one another with a warning.  There is a stranger in the woods.  The birds are the first to announce this unprecedented event.  A blue jay perched on a branch gives hew and cry.  An owl (sadly, the book does not say what kind of owl it is) asks a myriad of different questions about the stranger.  After the birds have had their say, the mammals chime in.  Neither muskrat nor deer has seen the stranger pass, but a squirrel is quick to spot the red hatted one.  Ever so slowly the animals approach, soon fighting over who should be the first to reach the stranger.  A chickadee takes the lead, perching on the stranger's fine carrot nose.  After it announces that this odd white creature is covered in tasty treats, everyone wants to come close.  It has nuts for eyes, and a hat full of seeds.  Even the timid doe is bold enough to snatch the creature's nose.  Unseen, two children crouch behind some oddly computer manipulated greenery, replenishing their snowman's hat, eyes, and nose so that the animals will have more to eat another day.<br />As I've said, the pictures are lovely.  This is winter at its brightest and bleakest.  The sky is a permanent grey with cheery trees and grounds of white.  Children reading this book will be delighted at the prospect that kids like themselves could come so close to the variety of different animals and birds that live in snowy woods in wintertime.  Many of the photographs are digitally manipulated, but the manipulation (with the exception of the aforementioned weirdo trees the kids hide behind) for the most part is not jarring to the eye.  Unfortunately, when photographers decide to write children's books, they should consider hiring a writer as well.  While the story the book tells is inviting, the text is sadly stilted.  Some of the book rhymes, but it can't seem to make up its mind whether to rhyme all the time, or only in sections.  Therefore, a section reading \\"Wow!  A carrot!  Do I have to share it?\\" is followed by \\"What is this? questioned the fawn as he passed a curious object in the snow\\".  Beyond the obvious objections such as these, the book reads without much in the way of flair or verve.  Textually it's like every other mediocre picture book out there.  The only difference is that its matched with beautifully staged photographs.<br />Author/photographers Carl R. Sams II & Jean Stoick would have done well to consult similar picture books about different animals interacting with humans in the winter months.  Sadly this book does not live up to the standards set by such lush winter fantasies as \\"The Big Snow\\", a Caldecott winning book written and illustrated by another husband and wife team, Berta and ElmerHader.  If you'd like a wintery tale that is well drawn as well as well written, seek that book out ASAP.  If, on the other hand, you don't mind reading something that's a little dull but pretty to the eye, by all means go to \\"Stranger In the Woods\\".  It's inoffensive enough, but when you can consider all the wonderful picture books available to kids today I can't really recommend the title wholeheartedly.  It's a nice book.

Funny, that is, because she finds everything in the world so very amusing.  I'll begin by stating that this 1973 Caldecott winner is probably not very accurate in its representations of Japan.  That said, let's move on and examine a story that contains elements of everything from \\"Strega Nona\\" and the song \\"On Top of Spaghetti\\" to that ancient tale of the \\"The Gingerbread Man\\".<br /><br />This is the story of a funny little woman who lives all by herself in her own little hut.  She's a dumpling maker by trade, and one day a naughty dumpling escapes down a crack in her floor.  As she reaches for it, the floor gives way and the woman finds herself on an ancient road surrounded by statues of gods.  The statues warn the woman not to attract the attention of the local Oni (an evil demon) but the woman's giggles can't keep her hidden for long.  Soon she's cooking for all the Oni in their homes with the help of a magic paddle.  By the end, however, the woman wishes to return to her house and it is only when she is able to make the Oni laugh at her (rather than vice versa) that she is enabled to escape and prosper.<br /><br />Like all good folktales, this one contains elements that are familiar throughout the world.  Illustrator Blair Lent (also of \\"Tikki Tikki Tembo\\" fame) has outdone himself with these pictures.  The castles of the Oni are a deep jade green.  When the funny little woman runs before them, her bright orange dress glowing brightly and the contrast is superb.  The story is one that kids will enjoy as well.  Though the Oni are fearsome, the threat they pose is somewhat minimal.  After all, they just want to be fed.  The added element of having the woman laugh at unexpected (and sometime unwarranted) times gives the story an extra-added kick.  Kids will really enjoy the picture of the demons sitting, their cheeks full of river water and their bellies distended.<br /><br />Though this tale really doesn't have the staying power of its better-known predecessor, it is still a worthwhile read.  Anyone interested in reading a story that examines the perils that come with living in an enchanted world will enjoy this delightful tale.heeks full of river water and their bellies distended.<br /><br />Though this tale really doesn't have the staying power of its better-known predecessor, it is still a worthwhile read.

By my estimates, there are roughly one million \\"just be yourself\\" picture books available on the market today.  These range from Madonna's uber-hokey \\"The English Roses\\" to older and far more adept books like Leo Lionni's classic, \\"Swimmy\\".  In the case of \\"Widget\\", author Lyn Rossiter McFarland and her illustrating husband Jim McFarland have taken a slightly different route.  By using a story in which being true to one's own self (apologies to W. Shakespeare) is not only desirable but also necessary, they have written a truly sweet story.  Cat and dog lovers alike should be pleased.<br /><br />Widget is a small white dog and if I knew my dogs better I could probably tell you his breed.  Possibly a terrier.  A stray, he finds warmth and shelter in the home of one Mrs. Diggs.  Unfortunately, Mrs. Diggs (having not yet reached \\"crazy cat lady\\" status, but certainly on her way there) owns six finicky felines that don't like dogs at all.  Noting their disapproval, Widget sets out to show one and all that he can be just as cat-like as any of them.  If they meow, he meows.  If they puff up and hiss, he puffs up and hisses.  In fact, Widget is so complete in his cat-like activities that he even purrs, plays with toy mice, and (I'm sure many dog lovers would kill for their pets to learn this one) uses the litter box.  Stunned, the cats accept him and Widget eventually forgets that he's a dog at all.  One day, however, Mrs. Diggs has an accident and Widget comes to the unarguable decision that sometimes being a dog is a very useful thing indeed.<br /><br />Anyone familiar with that old Disney cartoon about \\"Lambert, the Sheepish Lion\\", in which a lion tries to pretend to be a sheep and ends up saving the flock from a wolf?  This isn't exactly that story, but it's pretty darn close.  The difference here, however, is the clever turn in events.  When Widget decides that barking is the only way to get the neighbors attention (and help for his fallen mistress), the cats decide to bark too.  This is a far more satisfying ending than one in which the dog, who has capitulated to the desires of his fellow pets, is alone in acting like his natural canine self.  After pretending to be a cat for so long, it's only fair that the kitties should eventually follow his lead and become like a dog too (when necessity calls, that is).  Lyn McFarland's text is nice and clear.  It is fortunate, however, that her husband Jim McFarland is the illustrator.  This tale could easily have been given to an artist less adept in the ways of cats and dogs.  It could have become hokey or, worse still, sacchrine.  Fortunately, you're in safe hands here.  Widget is cute without being cloying.  And the cats are disapproving without ever becoming nasty or cruel.  McFarland's watercolors perfectly compliment a story in which an adorable animal finds shelter, love, and (eventual) acceptance.  I was impressed with his delicate lines, his subtle gradations of colors, and even his ways of displaying the tenderest of emotions on a face of a faithful pet.<br /><br />\\"Widget\\" really hasn't been recognized formally by the picture book community.  As it stands, it has not won huge prestigious awards or garnered worldwide attention.  Instead, it is a soft subtle little tale that makes everyone reading it happy.  If you're a cat or dog lover, I can't imagine you wouldn't take to it.  If, instead, you just want a well-written picture book to read to your kids, this is an ideal choice.  It's a top notch book all around.  Well done, McFarlands.too.

Like a lot of children, I came to discover Miss Nelson in a kind of roundabout way.  A child of the 80s, I am a first-generation \\"Reading Rainbow\\" graduate.  Which is to say, I watched it from the beginning.  One of the earliest episodes of this remarkable PBS program was a reading of the story \\"Miss Nelson Is Back\\".  For years I lay under the mistaken impression that this was the first, heck the ONLY Miss Nelson book put together by that crazy duo of Harry Allard and James Marshall.  Imagine my surprise when I discovered (much to my delight) the delightful \\"Miss Nelson Is Missing\\".  Here is where the Miss Nelson saga all started, and it is a joy to page through.<br /><br />As the book points out immediately, the kids in Room 207 were the worst behaved class in the whole school.  They were rude and nasty and they didn't pay any attention to their sweet-natured teacher Miss Nelson.  One day, however, Miss Nelson does not come to school.  In her place is the nasty, mean, foul-tempered witch Miss Viola Swamp.  A true crone through and through, Miss Swamp immediately whips the children into shape.  They are crushed by homework and forced to work that's long and hard.  It's not too long after Miss Swamp's arrival that the children start yearning for the lovely Miss Nelson.  Unfortunately, no one seems to be able to find her.  Finally, one day Miss Nelson comes back and the class is as well behaved as it can be.  Only the telltale black dress hanging in Miss Nelson's closet suggests that there may have been more to the class's transformation than initially met the eye.<br /><br />The story is one that children instantly love.  After all, they feel incredibly intelligent when they discover on their own that Miss Nelson and Miss Viola Swamp are one and the same.  Combine the funny text with James Marshall's goofy pictures and you've got yourself a fabulous classic.  Mr. Marshall once noted that he based the design of Miss Viola Swamp on a teacher he once had (and disliked so much that he was able to reincarnate her years later as the world's ultimate horrible teacher).  There's a lot to love in these pictures as well.  When a child writes math problems on the blackboard, some of the answers are a little off.  Children carry textbooks that read \\"Facts and More Facts\\" on their spines.  Best of all, Mr. Marshall never fails to put a little drop of his beloved Texas into the pictures somewhere.  Altogether, this book's a joy to flip through.<br /><br />If you've a kid who has a quirky sense of humor and likes to see naughty children put in their places, definitely give this book a shot.  It's a beautiful undertaking filled with great visual gags and an amusing text.  Also be sure to seek out its sequels.that he was able to reincarnate her years later as the world's ultimate horrible teacher).  There's a lot to love in these pictures as well.

Having learned his lesson from his encounter with the mice in \\"Chato's Kitchen\\" this kitty cat is now at peace with every animal he encounters.  So much so, in fact, that he is quite the partier.  While attending the birthday celebration of the dog Chorizo, Chato discovers a sad fact about his buddy Novio Boy.  Originally from the pound, Novio Boy never knew his mother and never had an official birthday.  That's all the info Chato needs as an excuse to throw for Novio Boy one of the biggest birthday celebrations ever.  He hires a dj, buys tons of food and presents, even purchases a gigantic blow-up dog to fight with.  As the guests arrive, however, one fact remains alarmingly clear.  Novio Boy was never invited to his own party!  After some scrambling and a mistaken death everything turns out for the best and Novio Boy has one of the best pachangas a cat could hope for.<br /><br />If you've never read a book that combines the effortless writing style of Gary Soto with the eye-popping grandeur of Susan Guevara, you're in for a treat.  Like \\"Chato's Kitchen\\" this book provides a useful Spanish/English glossary for quick referencing.  Spanish words pop up in appropriate places, never sounding forced or out of sync with the storyline.  But illustrator Guevara has truly outdone herself here.  In the previous Chato book the crazy energy and color of life was remarkable but not overwhelming.  Here, on the other hand, Guevara's pulled out all the stops.  From the guardian angel-like imagery of Novio Boy's mother that flies, unseen, from picture to picture, to Chorizo's beret and the repetitive phrase (which I loved ) \\"We are not a minority\\" that appears in a couple scenes in the background, this book has it all.  Best of all is the moment in which each character (thinking Novio Boy dead) stands and thinks of what they liked best about him.  As they do, Novio Boy appears on each person's head, acting out their compliments.  Guevara also has a sense of movement that allows each character to slouch, run, relax, or dance in a natural free flowing way.  It's a talent most illustrators pray they'll attain in their lifetimes.<br /><br />Some people might be put off by the energy and dynamics in this book.  If so, I am truly sorry.  My advice would be to flip through this book to make sure you're up to the challenge of reading it to your kids.  After all, if your reading style is flat and colorless, this is not the book to put your children to bed with.  You are, in fact, unworthy of the text.  If instead, however, you have a sense of style and flair that can match this eloquent book, definitely seek it out.

King of the road.	\\"Adam of the Road\\" is daunting, no question.  Kids who have no difficulties lugging huge Harry Potter sized tomes might quaver a little at the 317 page density of this 1943 Newbery winner.  If they go so far as to actually begin to read the book, however, they might be pleasantly surprised to find it not only readable, but enjoyable to boot.  On its most basic level the book is a tale about a boy, his father, and his dog.  Beyond that, however, the book quickly becomes a quest novel where our hero picks up friends and foes along his path.  In the end, a richly satisfying creation.<br /><br />Our tale begins in June of 1294 in a little English abbey named St. Alban's.  Here, our hero Adam has been left by his father, Roger the minstrel.  Adam anticipates Roger's return (he never refers to his father by anything but the man's name, interestingly) any day.  In the meantime, he has his friend and fellow student Perkin and his cocker spaniel Nick to keep him company.  With an appropriate amount of pomp and flair, return Roger does.  With his pop now a minstrel for a fine Lord, Adam is whisked away from the Abbey to join his father on the road.  They adventure hither and yon, charming some people and amusing others.  After some unfortunate run-ins with a less than chivalrous fellow minstrel named Jankin, Adam finds his dog stolen.  So eager is Adam to get Nick back that in the course of his pursuit of Jankin he also loses his father.  Thus, an eleven year-old boy must face a cold world with just his harp and minstrel skills to earn him food and shelter as he continually seeks his dad and dog.<br /><br />As I read this story, a lingering memory began to form in my mind.  Middle ages England... Minstrel & jesting skills... A boy and his father (or father-figure)... By George this is a remarkably similar plot to the 2003 Newbery award winning book, \\"Crispin: The Cross of Lead\\"!  Certainly there are vast differences between the two as well, but people who wish to tie \\"Crispin\\" to another text would do very well indeed to consider the worthy \\"Adam of the Road\\".  Now \\"Crispin\\" is a very socially conscious novel, pondering the fate of the poor and their servitude to the rich.  \\"Adam of the Road\\", much to my surprise, was also fairly socially conscious (considering its publication date).  Here the gentle reader may find complaints that the members of Parliament are all of noble birth and decide the rights of the people without asking for input from those they have (virtually) enslaved.  There is a healthy amount of skepticism and careful examination of the religious leaders that have such a powerful hold over their communities.  And most impressive of all was a section in which Adam seriously considers the double standard to which women were held at that time.  In this scene, Adam has been informed that ladies may not chose their mates according to their hearts as the romantic ballads have said.  The book says:<br />\\"The tales Roger told were full of the reverence and devotion that knghts paid to fair ladies and the desperate dangers they met gladly in order to win a smile from the ladies or a favor to wear on their sleeves.  But in real life, it seemed, a beautiful young lady like Emilie was only a girl and it did not matter what she wanted because she had to do what she was told.  It was very strange-\\".<br />Not only unromantic, but a hardship on the women themselves.  Nothing like a little knowledgable reasoning within a children's book, eh?<br />There's plenty of rip-roaring adventures in this book, as well as amusing games that boys at that time liked to play.  I'll admit right now that I was shocked to enjoy this book.  When you've slogged through such Newbery winners as the tedious \\"Dobry\\", the mildly offensive \\"White Stag\\" or the incredibly racist \\"Daniel Boone\\", an actual honest-to-goodness fun book like this takes you completely by surprise.  And did I mention the illustrations by Robert Lawson?  You may remember this talented artist from such books as \\"The Story of Ferdinand\\", \\"They Were Strong and Good\\", and \\"Mr. Poppin's Penguins\\".  If you've never seen a Lawson illustration, this book would be a wonderful place to start.  Riddling the tale with entrancing pictures and illustrations I really feel that Lawson is the extra nudge that pushes \\"Adam of the Road\\" from midly amusing to downright fun.  The book looks daunting, but definitely pick it up.

Until I read this book I had never seen a dedication in a picture book in which the illustrator thanked the author.  Yet lo and behold, at the beginning of \\"Diary of a Wombat\\" read the words, \\"Thanks for letting me play, Jackie.  This was fun\\", signed by illustrator Bruce Whatley.  He's not wrong either.  The book is a heaping helpful of fun, starring a cuddly adorable little wombat and her low key adventures.  Having been published at the same time as the similarly titled (and, in my humble opinion, less impressive) book, \\"Diary of a Worm\\", \\"Diary of a Wombat\\" never really received the praise and adoration it so rightly deserved.  To me, this book is the perfect balance of cute and sly (a difficult mixture indeed).<br /><br />We follow our heroine, a rolly-polly little unnamed wombat as she goes about her days.  For a wombat, life doesn't consist of much more than sleeping, munching on some grass, and sleeping again.  The first few days we spend with the wombat proceed at about this pace.  All that changes when the wombat acquires some new human neighbors.  A family of wide-eyed Australians first meet the little creature when she decided to use their picnic area as her own personal dustbath.  Please note the shocked lovebirds perched on a nearby birdbath.  As the days go by the wombat slowly but surely teaches her humans to feed her carrots as well as oats.  By the end, she comes to the undeniable conclusion that, \\"humans are easily trained and make quite good pets\\".<br /><br />I can't imagine a single objection that could be successfully lobbied against this tale.  Let us consider, first of all, the wombat herself.  Think of a teddy bear with a slightly larger nose and I think you'll have a rough idea of what I'm describing here.  The wombat is incapable, it seems, of anger or malicious intent.  All the damage she does comes from a self-absorbed sense of what is best for herself.  Wet laundry in the way?  Get rid of it.  Humans not feeding you lately?  Make a ruckus with their metal garbage can.  She is drawn particularly realistically, which of course makes her all the funnier.  It is a relief that the humans have not yet taken steps to rid themselves of this particularly intense and likable little pest.  Who can resist her half-closed eyes as she chews contentedly on a freshly grown carrot?<br /><br />Not only does Jackie French tell her tale with just the right amount of humor and timing but Bruce Whatley outdoes himself with his whimsical illustrations.  Wombats never had it so good.  If you're looking for something cute but witty, that treads between the humorous and the tragic with fantastic results (not to mention being more than a little kid-friendly), then I present for your reading enjoyment, and the enjoyment of your peers/children, \\"Diary of a Wombat\\".with their metal garbage can.

The version repeated in that book and then retold in \\"The Rough-Face Girl\\" is almost perfectly identical.  In a way, this proves the entrancing nature of this tale, and its capacity for retellings.  With Rafe Martin's book, one of the best Cinderella stories from around the globe (if not THE best) is accompanied by David Shannon's fabulous illustrations.  The combination is incredible.<br /><br />In this tale, once an Algonquin girl lived with her father and cruel older sisters.  These girls forced their younger sibling to feed their fires, causing her arms and face to become burnt and scarred.  Her hair became charred and lifeless as well.  Also in this village was an invisible man who was rumored to be rich and powerful.  One day the sisters decide to wed the Invisible Being (I guess they both figured on sharing him).  When confronted by his sister, the girls are asked to describe his bow and the runner of his sled.  Unable to do so, they are sent away.  The next day the rough faced girl goes to do the same and she too meets with the sister of the Invisible Being.  You can probably guess the rest.<br /><br />As Cinderella tales go, this one gives its heroine more of an active role than the European Cinderella ever had.  Where Cinderella relies on a magical fairy godmother and a prince to track her down, the rough faced girl fashions her own clothing and sets out to meet the Invisible Being despite the taunts of the villagers that doubt her.  True, this is a fairy tale and therefore subject to the idea that for women, fulfillment comes with a good marriage.  But honestly, most tales rely on this conceit.  This tale has elements of the Cupid/Psyche stories, Beauty and the Beast, and many others, while at the same time remaining a true and accomplished original.<br /><br />Shannon's accompanying illustrations are very interesting.  Most artists that depict Native Americans in storybook form (like, say, \\"A Boy Called Slow\\") don't draw characters that display much in the way of emotion.  Call it a different kind of racism, if you will.  Shannon, however, seems to have taken heart from the fact that this is a fantasy and not a piece of non-fiction.  His evil sisters sneer and flounce.  As they parade through the village in their new clothes their noses are held quite high.  His rough faced girl is never viewed directly, so long as she remains scarred and unhappy.  The closest moment we get is when she is crouched beside the fire, the shadows playing on her face and bandaged arms.  When at last she bathes in a lake and is revealed to be beautiful the moment, while nice, is accompanied by an odd illustration that conjures up the word \\"pin-up\\" more than anything else.  In my favorite illustration, we see the Invisible Being towering over his new betrothed, obviously a really good looking dude.  Shannon has a way of playing with light and shadow in this book that conceals as much as it reveals.  I was particularly taken with the clever picture that displayed the Invisible Being astride the milky way, his waist made up the three stars that represent Orion's Belt.<br /><br />Truthfully, I am not well acquainted with the Algonquin way of life.  I therefore cannot vouch that this book is perfectly faithful to the mode of dress and lives of its people.  What I can ascertain is that the book is respectful to its subjects as well as its subject matter.  It's a fabulous looking and sounding creation that every child, teen, and adult should be well-acquainted with.

A wonderful range of different names and titles were spouted and amongst them was the book, \\"Children of the Wolf\\".  After reading through it, I'm happy (and sad, I suppose) to say that the person suggesting it was correct in their assessment of the novella.  It is both really quite good and really quite forgotten.  For all you Jane Yolen fans out there, I highly recommend you give a glance to \\"Children of the Wolf\\".  For all you fans of well-written children's literature, ditto.<br /><br />We find ourselves in India in the early 20th century.  Our hero, Mohandas, is a child of an orphanage run by kindly British missionaries.  After the Rev. Welles is asked by a superstitious member of a nearby village to rid the land of an evil ghost, Mohandas takes a trip with some men to find out what all the fuss is about.  The group discovers that rather than spirits of the dead, two feral girls raised by wolves have been roaming the land.  In an act of supposed Christian charity, Mr. Welles takes the girls back to his orphanage and places Mohandas in charge of their education and upbringing.  What Mohandas and his friends are soon to find is that while it may be easy to take the girls out of the forest, it is far less easy to take the forest out of the girls.<br /><br />The story is somewhat like \\"The Jungle Book\\" rendered slightly more realistic.  There are no talking animals here and unlike Mowgli these girls are thoroughly wild.  Their very bodies have adapted to their environments and they seem incapable of undergoing \\"civilizing\\" influences.  Basing her story on a \\"true\\" discovery of two such girls in October of 1920, Yolen points out that this is not meant to be a factual tale necessarily.  Rather, she prefers (quoting Emily Dickinson) to, \\"dwell in possibility\\".  It does not matter if the reported \\"facts\\" of the case are true or not.  What matters is the story Yolen is able to weave out of such a tale.<br />And weave she does.  It is unfortunate that the book is as sparse as it is.  Written at a scant 136 pages, you get a very clear idea of the girls and the narrator but not much of a fleshing out of anyone else.  I would have liked to have known more about the other children in the orphanage, kids prone to cruelty at a drop of the hat.  I would have liked to have learned about the missionaries that ran the orphanage and what their story was.  But the author has focused her attention very narrrowly on the here and the now.  The story is not necessarily a happy one, but it is an interesting one and it is written well.  For those readers that enjoyed, \\"The Jungle Book\\", (and I know they exist), further tales of children unbound by rules or \\"civilized\\" society can be very intriguing indeed.  It's a rousing good story.  I recommend you take a gander if you think it might be your cup of tea.What matters is the story Yolen is able to weave out of such a tale.  <br />And weave she does.

647737:US	49148452	R1MAW1YY68UV20	0375828192	839301586	Lyra's Oxford	Books	4	5	5	N	N	A tightly woven fable	Taking his fan base completely by surprise (those members of his fan base that aren't ardent followers anyway) Philip Pullman has added a new chapter to the \\"His Dark Materials\\" saga.  The series that catapulted Pullman from a minor children's literature existence to magnificent and overwhelming kiddie lit super-stardom has a new book to its name.  Entitled \\"Lyra's Oxford\\", the book is consists of the following:  A quote, an introduction, a story, and ephemera.  This book is merely a small link to the further adventures to follow, it seems.  As such, it stands as a perfect little entity within its own right.<br /><br />The plot found in this book is nothing so much as a short story.  Some 43 pages long it tells the tale of Lyra and her daemon Pantalaimon.  A quick note: If you haven't read any of the other \\"His Dark Materials Books\\" you could probably slog through this novella, though I wouldn't recommend it.  Exposition isn't dwelt on here.  The tale begins when Lyra and Pan spot a wayward daemon of a witch being attacked by a flock of starlings.  After rescuing the much maligned creature the daemon bird tells them that he is frantically searching for a man named Makepeace.  Lyra and Pan are charged to find this man and help the daemon save his mistress from death.  Stirring stuff and a nice little story in its own right.  Here we finally get a glimpse into Lyra's daily life.  Jordan College has been fleshed out a little more and we meet various professors and students as Lyra searches for information about Makepeace.  By the end of the tale, more questions have been raised than answered but barring the unfortunate death of the author (not likely) we'll have further Lyra goings on to look forward to soon.<br /><br />If I've any problems with the book they probably stem from a single moment.  Not to give anything away, Lyra is faced at some point with almost certain danger and/or death.  In summoning her courage the girl thinks to herself, \\"Will-Will-be like Will-\\".  Huh?  This is the first moment our spunky heroine has EVER pretended to be anyone else in order to face her fears.  This suggests that we are dealing with a softer gentler Lyra, a thought confirmed when Pullman writes that for Lyra, \\"the slightest thing had the power to move her to pity and distress\\".  I miss the old headstrong Lyra.  The strong independent Lyra.  There are glimpses of her here, but not enough to fully put my mind at rest.  I can only hope that the future books will remember that old Lyra better than this book does.<br /><br />Now the story I was describing was actually entitled \\"Lyra and the Birds\\".  \\"Lyra's Oxford\\" is the name of the book itself and it is a great deal more interesting.  Here we can find maps of Oxford, postcards (one from Mary Malone herself!), photographs, advertisements, pages from old books, and a variety of other odds and ends.  The effect is nothing so much as a childlike version of the \\"Griffin and Sabine\\" books, once so popular.  In his introduction to the book, Pullman reflects that these little bits and pieces of ourselves that are sometimes the most telling.  While their importance may remain hidden to us for now, readers are advised to hold onto this book tightly for future reference.  It is obviously awash in clues that will become clearer in time.  I myself was particularly interested in one of the advertisements for a book entitled, \\"The Bronze Clocks of Benin\\".  Its author, Marisa Coulter, may stir a couple memories here and there.  And there and here.<br /><br />Altogether, I'd say the book's a delicate and successful composition.  Its back cover advertises it as \\"beguiling\\" and I am inclined to agree.  Some people may complain that for its price it is relatively small.  Others will pore for hours over the various countries in Lyra's world (advertised by the \\"Globetrotter\\") and possible cruise destinations.  If you're a fan of a book that will allow you to pick apart thousands of ideas and clues, I think you'll find \\"Lyra's Oxford\\" charming.s Oxford\\" charming.	2004-05-31
647897:US	49148452	R2BE2N910F9FK6	0440212669	167772423	BELOW THE ROOT (Laurel-leaf Books)	Books	5	60	61	N	N	To the green wood, green wood tree.	I suspect that I'm the only one who remembers this.  In the early to mid 1980s I owned a Commodore 64 computer game (yes, I am that ancient and wise) called \\"Below the Root\\".  In this game you could chose to be one of four players.  A small boy named Raamo, a small girl named Pomma, a tall boy named Neric, or a tall girl named Genaa.  The goal was to travel under the root, so to speak, to rescue a boy of great power.  You had all sorts of cool powers, depending on which character you were.  Some characters could pense people, thereby determining their emotions (hence I learned the word \\"avarice\\" at a very young age).  Some could kiniport objects without touching them.  Others could grunsprek, creating roots and plants that would allow you walk, virtually, on air.  I loved the game and it was one of the few I actually won.  Now, years and years later, I find that the basis of this favorite computer game was a well-written and infinitely entrancing novel of the same name.  Authored by the accomplished Zilpha Keatley Snyder, the book speaks freely about the price of creating and maintaining a free society.<br /><br />Raamo is thirteen years old and lives happily in a land called Green-sky.  His world is a society created in the tops of the trees.  Here, people have fashioned a wonderful peaceful life for themselves, never engaging in violence or negative feelings of any kind.  The only source of distress, in fact, comes from the evil Pash-shan that live below the surface of the earth below.  Inhuman creatures that steal children and adults when they can, the Pash-shan are imprisoned in their lairs by a thick vine called the Wissenroot.  Now Raamo has been given the chance to join the spiritual and governmental leaders of the land, named the Ol-zhaan.  Fame and glory are his, but the intervention of a fellow Ol-zhaan named Neric throws everything Raamo thought he knew about his world into chaos.  What if there is more to the Pash-shan than meets the eye?  What activities do the Ol-zhaan really engage in?  What are the secrets that seem to be destroying society as Raamo and his friends and family know it?  And what is the price happiness?<br /><br />Beginning this book I was immediately struck from the outset on how similar it was, in many ways, to Lois Lowry's \\"The Giver\\".  Both books are futuristic dystopian tales that focus on a boy learning that he is to be given a job of great importance.  Through this job this boy learns that his society is not perfect in the least, and that he must personally work to change the way things are.  But this book is also incredibly similar to H.G. Wells's \\"The Time Machine\\" too.  In both cases we have the happy dwellers above the earth and the miserable dwellers below.  Yet this book isn't like either of these novels at its heart.  Instead, it is a truly original tales about a society that has taken extreme measures to maintain the serenity and innocence of its tree-dwelling population.<br /><br />The characters in this book are fully developed and wonderfully flawed.  There's nothing worse than reading a story in which every person you meet is either a coal-hearted villain or a pure sweet-blooded soul.  Our hero, Raamo, is uncertain of himself and his world.  Unlike his companions he is reluctant to jump to conclusions at any time and it is his nobility and refusal to be considered above his peers that truly sets him apart.  His fellow Ol-zhaan Genaa is far more likely to rush to conclusions in pursuit of her own goals, but she's a good person at heart.  The sexy Neric (my interpretation, not the book's) is also apt to leap before he looks, but his intentions are pure.  The book also ends with a satisfying \\"to be continued...\\" feel that leaves you wanting more without feeling cheated.  A difficult task to say the least.<br /><br />Poor \\"Below the Root\\" has been forgotten over the years, y'know.  When people discuss good fantasy books, its name is rarely mentioned.  Nonetheless, I feel this series is one of the best there is.  If you happen to get a copy of this book (and being out-of-print that might be a bit of a trick) make certain you get one that contains illustrations by the adroit Alton Raible.  Perfectly complimenting the text, Raible's interpretations of certain scenes are not only adept but near perfect (with the exception of a single shot that is more bizarre than apt).  I really can't recommend this book enough.  It's true that there's a fair amount of exposition here and there, but I think kids that wade through it will be amply awarded.  This hereby ranks as my favorite book discovered by way of a computer game.  Great praise indeed!f the best there is.

In remembering the story of \\"The Velveteen Rabbit\\" I had placed it somewhere on par with syrupy sappy stories like \\"The Giving Tree\\" or \\"Love You Forever\\".  I had believed for quite some time that this book was an old but nonetheless overly sentimental tale that even the most dewey-eyed of youngsters would have some difficulty swallowing.  Then I reread it recently and I found that I was not correct in all of my assumptions.  Yes, \\"The Velveteen Rabbit\\" has its flaws.  It is prone to a couple ooey-gooey moments here and there, but on the whole it is a strong well-written work.  This is not a book that has earned its title as one of the best known and beloved works of fiction for children lightly.<br /><br />All children wish that their toys were real and could have feelings like the rest of us.  This kind of desire is what has spawned everything from the movie \\"Toy Story\\" to the classic Newbery Award winning book, \\"Hitty: Her First 100 Years\\".  In the case of \\"The Velveteen Rabbit\\", this wish is taken to an entirely different level.  In the beginning, a boy is given a fluffy stuffed rabbit made of softest velveteen.  The rabbit is told by an old skin horse about the wonders of one day becoming real, and it becomes the rabbit's deepest wish.  As the boy grows to love the rabbit and wear him down, the rabbit feels that he has indeed grown real.  One day the boy comes down with scarlet fever and it is necessary to burn the rabbit along with all his other toys.  Fortunately, the rabbit is saved by a magic fairy that turns him into a real rabbit.  A little time later the boy is out playing when he sees a rabbit that looks just like the old toy he used to own, little knowing that his toy has come back briefly to bid him one last look.<br /><br />I'm particularly attached to the editions of this tale that are accompanied by Michael Hague's illustrations.  Very popular in the 1980s, Hague has the ability to draw illustrations that are at once touching and at the same time a little realistic.  His pictures are filled with little touches and details that clever eyes might enjoy locating.  For example, a page displaying the velveteen rabbit and other toys shows a small frog toy looking very much like the Frog character from Hague's version of \\"Wind in the Willows\\".  On the bookshelf sits his edition of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", easily identifiable by its spine.  As for the characters in the pictures, they are delightful.  The rabbit grows floppier and more raggedy as the book goes on (not suprising when the boy enjoys dragging it about by one ear). The boy himself is a ruddy faced youth, as apt to tease the bunny as he is to lavish it with love and affection.  Hague has a way with light and color that make these pictures virtually leap off of their pages, and the result is a beautiful and elegant series of prints.<br /><br />I am pleased to report that \\"The Velveteen Rabbit\\" is just as important today as it has ever been.  This beautiful tale should always be accompanied by beautiful pictures, and so we are fortunate that Michael Hague lent it his skills.  I have no doubt that your children will be entranced by this tale.  I have even less doubt that you will find something in it yourself to make you pause and think over.

When you think of fantasy books in which characters band together to go on a mysterious quest, you think of one place.  Britain.  Most quest stories for children either are written by Brits or take place (as in the case of Lloyd Alexander's \\"Prydain Chronicles\\") in a European setting.  Honestly, the most notable exception to this rule is also the oldest.  \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" is a proudly American tale, beginning in Kansas and continuing in a land that has a particularly Yankee feel to it.  So it should come as no surprise that the man to follow in the late great L. Frank Baum's shoes should be none other than Michael Chabon.  An author mostly associated with books for adults, he has tried his hand at penning the ultimate American children's fantasy.  And to his credit, he nearly succeeds.<br /><br />\\"Summerland\\" begins on Clam Island where our hero, Ethan Feld, lives with his inventor father.  The two are relative newcomers to the isle, but they participate whole-heartedly in the local youth baseball team.  Ethan, unfortunately, is a horrendous player.  He dislikes the sport and is perfectly aware that he is the reason the team has lost its last seven games.  On one particular day, however, Ethan finds himself scouted by a local group of fairies or, as they prefer to be called, ferishers.  The ferishers are looking for a hero, and their hero scout has come up with Ethan.  Suddenly the boy that couldn't hit a baseball to save his life finds himself in charge of saving the universe in a world that couldn't possibly be any more different from his own.<br /><br />First of all, I should state that if you do not like baseball in the least, do not read this book.  \\"Summerland\\" hinges on the idea that in the Summerlands (a world like and unlike our own to which Ethan travels) baseball is a sport that absolutely everyone plays.  Entire civilizations have been destroyed by the designated-hitter rule.  Giants are capable of throwing thunder and lightening itself.  And in the end, existence itself is decided after nine straight innings.  The crazy crew of characters Ethan teams up with become his own private baseball team, and Ethan himself learns how to swing a mighty, if painful, bat.<br /><br />I enjoyed all the particularly American aspects of this tale.  The ferishers do not look like magical leprechauns or British elves.  Instead, they bear some resemblance to Native Americans and they play a mean game of ball.  Our heroes come across the ultimate trickster god/villain Coyote, and it is his plans that need to be changed for the world to keep on going.  They meet up with a group called the Big Liars, a motley assortment of some of the best tall tale legends ever to walk the American soil.  They befriend a sasquatch.  What Chabon is doing here is incorporating a variety of enjoyable motifs and images that conjure up some of the most beloved images of the United States itself.<br /><br />Which isn't to say the book is entirely a success.  There is a definite trend amongst established adult writers these days to switch focus and write for children.  Clive Barker, Joyce Carol Oats, Elmore Leonard, etc.  Chabon is just the latest author to jump aboard the kiddie lit bandwagon, but he's got a ways to go.  After all, it takes a fair amount of skill to successfully pen books that kids will not only read but also enjoy.  I can't fault Chabon's ideas, plot, or characters in \\"Summerland\\" because they are, one and all, entrancing.  That leaves the writing itself, and I'm afraid its just not up to par.  Chabon has a nasty habit of not explaining things, a writing style that works perfectly well for adults but is a strain on younger readers.  Large shifts in the plot occur from time to time without much in the way of explanation.  One of the characters, for example, explains how Coyote promised her a little brother but it turned out badly in the end.  A fair amount of guesswork has to go into understanding this speech and when all is said and doneit's still fairly unclear.  A multitude of different problems like this one sprout up all over the book.  It's almost as if Chabon hasn't yet discovered his children's literature voice as of yet.<br /><br />There's a lot to love in \\"Summerland\\" just the same.  Ethan Feld, our reluctant hero, is nothing so much as a slightly modified Charlie Brown.  Here we have a character that never succeeds without luck or a vast amount of effort.  He doesn't suddenly wake up one morning and decide that he's going to be heroic or superior.  And for the most part he's treated exactly like the boy he is by the other characters.  Unlike almost every other person in this story, Ethan is completely normal.  He has a deep wisdom that surfaces from time to time, but otherwise he's a believable child.  A person dissecting this book to pieces might well argue that the entire point of the story can be summarized as, \\"Magical events teach a boy to love baseball\\", and that wouldn't be far off.  It's the journey that takes him from disenchantment to a steadfast love of the game that makes the novel worth reading.  Other touches, like classic Native American folktales, the fate of men that place discovery over reason, and the names of the giants, all combine to make this little epic enjoyable and a stitch.<br /><br />It's not perfect, no.  It's not.  Michael Chabon has some practicing to do before he is included on the list of \\"Great Crossover Writers For Adults and Children\\" but he's definitely getting there.  He's accomplished something with this book that most writers never come to.  He's made an original American fantasy novel.  It's no \\"Wizard of Oz\\", but it's getting there.  And it is definitely worth your time and money to read it.  If you like stories where the heroes are good, the villains complex, and the situations dire if not hopeless, read yourself a little \\"Summerland\\".  It's a pip.fairly unclear.

Curse my name unto the heavens and wish me only vile tortures and various fates worse than death!  Why?  Because I did not like \\"The Christmas Witch\\".  Worse still, I kinda loathed it.  Before you judge me too quickly, allow me to explain.  I am a Steven Kellogg fan of the highest order.  I think Kellogg is the bee's knees.  His books raised me as a child and I cannot recommend highly enough his superb \\"The Mysterious Tadpole\\", his eloquent \\"Island of the Skog\\" or his urbane \\"The Day Jimmy's Boa Ate the Wash\\".  The man is a master at what he does, whether he is merely illustrating a book or taking on the role of author as well.  So imagine my shock and horror when I picked up \\"The Christmas Witch\\", read it through once, read it through twice, and came to the undeniable conclusion that the book is just plain awful.<br /><br />First of all, there is the title to contend with.  Perhaps Mr. Kellogg was unaware of the already existing and very charming \\"Christmas Witch\\" fable told throughout Italy and extending as far as Russia.  For those of your interested in THAT story, I direct you to \\"The Christmas Witch\\" by Ilse Plume.  Better yet, read \\"Baboushka and the Three Kings\\" by R. Robbins (a Caldecott winner, no less).  Both are wonderful Christmas stories.  And both are heads and tails better than this little droplet.<br /><br />I will explain further.  The plot of this book is a little intense.  Kids ready to be primed for Harry Potter will delight in this alternative tale of a witch attending the Academy for Young Goblins and Witches.  A bit of a failure in the broom department, a little witch named Gloria one day stumbles on (bear with me now) a holy angel reading Christmas stories to magic elves.  The angel takes Gloria on an intergalactic trip (who knew witches liked to travel in space?) to a planet where two factions (the Pepperwills and the Valdoons) are fighting a long war.  Gloria sets about bringing the two sides together by fixing up an abandoned castle (with the help of the magical elves) and inviting the enemies to in on alternate days.  One day she tricks the two sides into partying at a masked ball with one another, just as the evil Madame Pestilence (head of Gloria's old school) sets about ruining Chrismas.  In the end, however, all is well and the Pepperwills and Valdoons decide never to fight again.<br /><br />It sounds reasonable enough on paper.  I was a little confused by the disparate elements of 1) Witches 2) An entirely different planet and 3) Elves and angels.  To my mind, none of this mixes particularly well.  It's almost as if Kellogg has tried to incorporate too many elements in too many different ways.  Then too, his writing is rather bad on this book.  It's difficult to write a story about a holiday as beloved as Christmas without becoming schmaltzy.  And let me tell you, any book that can contain (without irony) the words, \\"Remember how happy you were when the magic of Christmas entered your hearts?\\", is drowning in goo.<br /><br />None of this is to say that Kellogg's drawings suffer at all.  Frankly, he's done a wonderful job with them.  With the possible exception, of course, of little Gloria throwing out her arms to her masquerade guests, ridiculously large tears careening down her face.  She looks like a slightly altered big-eyed child poster circa 1964.  Otherwise, however, all the old Kellogg touches are there.  The sight gags.  The reoccurring characters.  The colorful lines and shadings.<br /><br />The book has a bad beginning, a shabby middle, and an awesomely awful end.  I, for one, did not much care for it.  There are thousands of worthwhile Christmas tales to tell to your little ones.  I've already suggested two but there are many many more worth sharing and discovering.  Don't waste your time and energy on this sub-par offering.  Instead, locate a worthwhile Kellogg title and discover the meaning of Christmas with some other author.  Preferably someone who can deliver a message with a wry smile and a wink.o can deliver a message with a wry smile and a wink.	2004-05-31

What could be more natural?  This poet shares her gifts with the small people that inhabit her hometown (in this case, Chicago).  What did surprise me was the original publication date of this title.  Now I read through this entire collection of urban poetry and I had a fairly clear idea that these poems must have been written in the 1970s.  After all, collections of poems featuring African-American children were just beginning to blossom after the Civil Rights movement.  I was feeling pretty smug until I glanced at the date in question.  1956.  So roughly twenty years before the United States understood the importance of creating children's literature for people from all walks of life, Gwendolyn Brooks was taking matters into her own hands.<br /><br />\\"Bronzeville Boys and Girls\\" collects thirty-four short poems about children into a single compendium.  Each poem contains the name of a child.  This child is either the subject of the poem, or the person delivering it.  Taken as a whole, the book feels like nothing so much as a slightly updated series of nursery rhymes.  Brooks is an accomplished poet and there is something about the way her lines scan that feels old and established.  Take, for example, this poem entitled, \\"John, Who Is Poor\\".  \\"Give him a berry, boys, when you may/ And, girls, some mint when you can/ And do not ask when his hunger will end/ Nor yet when it began\\".  For me, these poems acknowledge the struggles that all children, regardless of race, face in the world's poverty laden big cities.  Though most the poems have an element of whimsy or light-heartedness to them, many are socially conscious.  The boy who does not receive what he wants for Christmas reflects, \\"To frown or fret would not be fair/ My Dad must never know I care/ It's hard enough for him to bear\\".  You won't find any poems about some of the harsher aspects of city living (drugs, prostitution, etc.) that are so common these days, in part because this book was published so very long ago.  Also, it is written with a distinctly young age group in mind.  Accompanying Ms. Brooks's verses are various illustrations by Ronni Solbert.  The combination of words with images felt almost like a predecessor to Shel Silverstein at times, though I'd be hard pressed to tell you exactly why.  It's just something about the occasional silliness of the children pictured.<br />At the moment, the big urban nursery rhyme crowd pleaser is the accomplished, \\"The Neighborhood Mother Goose\\".  But that book just restructures old nursery rhymes for contemporary kids.  Gwendolyn Brooks went so far as to create new and exiting nursery rhymes for the children of her day and age.  Today, most of them read as crisp and clearly as they did the day they were made.  There are some exceptions, of course.  A couple poems feel a little stilted or overly formal towards the kids reading them today.  But many are fine examples of superior writing.  If you ever find that you are able to locate a copy of \\"Bronzeville Boys and Girls\\", I suspect that you will not regret the fact any time soon.ts of city living (drugs, prostitution, etc.) that are so common these days, in part because this book was published so very long ago.

There's something about Crockett Johnson (real name David Johnson Leisk) that is instantly recognizable.  Like Matt Groening of \\"The Simpsons\\" fame, Johnson had a particular style of drawing that was both simple and infinitely adaptable.  Though he drew the comic strip \\"Barnabus\\" and the incredibly simple, \\"The Carrot Seed\\", it is \\"Harold and the Purple Crayon\\" that won Johnson the fame he has today.  The story has been ripped off a million times in a million different ways, but we can all credit this original as the first of the first.  All hail that spunky Harold and his oh-so purple crayon.<br /><br />When we first meet Harold he and his magical purple crayon are already well acquainted.  No picture in this book appears that Harold does not draw himself (aside from Harold himself).  Our intrepid hero sets off on a series of small adventures that are both intentionally and unintentionally caused by his crayon.  Drawing everything from the moon (which makes a point to appear on every single page that Harold finds himself on) to dragons to flying balloons to a policeman, Harold has a gay old time.<br /><br />Wanna hear a petty complaint?  A petty, insignificant, hardly-worth-listening-to complaint?  Okay, here goes..... it bothers me that Harold's crayon never gets smaller.  By logical extension it should, shouldn't it?  Of course, by logical extension I should remember that this is, after all, a MAGIC purple crayon.  Maybe magic crayons don't get smaller.  Obviously I don't know the rules that govern crayons particularly well.  If I did I wouldn't be having these problems.  In any case, that's my only objection to this book.  It is, I know from personal experience, a heavily adored and respected story.  People will carry copies of this book with them all their lives.  There is something about Harold and his tiny adventures that speaks to the hearts of millions.  If you've never had the pleasure of reading a Crockett Johnson book, this is the place to start.  If you have read this book, read it again.  It's just that good.read this book, read it again.  It's just that good.	2004-05-27

If you are at all familiar with Peter Sis, then you linger under the incorrect impression that you know what to expect from him.  Carefully researched subjects.  Illustrations containing infinitesimally small people, places, and things.  Engaging and entertaining plots.  I tell you now, ladies and gents, \\"Tree of Life\\" takes all of this and multiplies it.  Quadruples it.  You have never seen a picture book like this before.  When you are dealing with a book that cares to discuss the origins of life itself, you need an author/illustrator comfortable with details.  In this, Sis is your man.<br /><br />This is a summarization and encapsulation of the life of Mr. Charles Robert Darwin.  The book begins like so:<br /><br />\\"Charles Darwin opens his eyes for the first time!  He has no idea that he will (a) start a revolution when he grows up, (b) sail around the world on a five-year voyage, (c) spend many years studying nature, and (d) write a book that will change the world\\".<br /><br />From here on in we watch Darwin learn and grow.  The text is separated, initially, into two parts.  One portion is in bold and discusses the facts of Darwin's life.  An italicized portion below this talks about Charles's passions and desires.  Up above we see little images and factoids strewn about the page willy-nilly, giving us a better sense of the times and people involved in the naturalist's life.  This form and style goes out the window when Darwin joins up with the Beagle.  Suddenly the pages become drawings of creatures and sights.  There is a magnificent two-page spread of boxes, each one carrying an interesting fact, animal, moment, or image that Darwin encountered.  It's as if his very experiences have been cataloged for the reader's viewing pleasure.  Eventually Darwin returns and as he does so the pages themselves return to the previous layout.  Now, however, Darwin's life has been divided into three different parts.  He has a public life, a private life, and a secret (read evolutionary) life.  Every individual life is outlined on each page and as we read on we understand how a single person's dreams can be affected by their personal and private triumphs and catastrophies.  When, \\"On the Origin of the Species\\" is published we find a full pull-out four page spread encompassing the enormity of this publication.  Images on the pages become less straightforward and more dreamlike.  At long last, accompanying a vision of a solitary Magritte-like Darwin surrounded by a clan of death's head hawk moths are the words, \\"Charles Darwin died on April 19, 1882, and was buried in Westminster Abbey\\".<br /><br />According to the book's author/illustrator, Darwin was, himself, unable to draw.  So rather than sketch the wonders he saw while on the Beagle, the naturalist would describe his visions with great detail.  In this way, Sis has become Darwin's right hand.  It is impossible to flip through this book and not be amazed at the intricacy of the project.  Sis is almost a pointillist at times, his Seurat-like dots forming everything from the galleys of a ship to thousands of tiny houses in London.  A child reading this book could pore over a single page for hours, interpreting and reinterpreting each digression and off-hand comment.  Honestly, you've never seen a book like this one before.  The image that stands out most prominently in my mind is that of Darwin astride a giant rock dove that is made up of a thousand domesticated descendents.<br /><br />Which brings us to the idea of a children's book concerned with evolution in the first place.  \\"The Tree of Life\\" is hardly alone in this respect.  For example, the ambitious \\"Our Family Tree\\" by Lisa Westberg Peters is far more direct in voicing the facts of evolution than this book in many respects.  Here, Sis seems to avoid controversy as much as possible.  The spread that describes every chapter and thought that went into the making of \\"On the Origin of the Species\\" is accompanied by the caveat, \\"Darwin did not say that God had not created life on earth. What he said was that creation did not happen all at once\\".  Take that.  Some time is spent examining the Bishop Samuel Wilberforce's objections and the Great Oxford Debate of 1860, but it is given far less time or energy than the book's page on, say, the Galapagos Islands.  I would have liked some explanations on why some people didn't (and still do not) like Darwin's theories.  Even a cursory explanation of the opposition wouldn't have been inappropriate considering the subject matter. Alas, here Sis is lacking.<br /><br />All this notwithstanding, this is a fine piece of kiddie lit.  If you remain unconvinced and require just a little more information about this book's fine nature, I merely direct you to the endpapers.  In most picture books, the endpapers in the front of the book match and duplicate the endpapers at the back.  Yet even here, Sis has not skimped.  From the evolving feet of horses to the hand of Michaelangelo's God reaching towards Adam's, these pages are all individual and unique, making them just as important as any other portion of the book.  I shudder to think what will happen to them when this book comes out in paperback.  Though some will argue that this book is too advanced for children, challenge this statement.  Test it for yourself.  Any child that likes detail, precision, and nature will at least enjoy portions of this book.  In a word - fabulous.say that God had not created life on earth.

In this book, a fox walks through the forest and grows quite thirsty.  Seeing a pail of milk sitting unattended, he quickly laps it up.  Unfortunately, he is caught and an old woman in her anger cuts off his tail.  The fox pleads with her to sew it back on, but the woman is stubborn.  To get his tail back he must give her some milk.  The fox then asks a cow for some milk and is told that he must first bring it some grass.  The fox asks the field for grass, but it insists that he bring it some water.  This goes on and on until at long last a miller with a kingly disposition turns everything around by helping the poor little fox.<br /><br />In some ways, the illustrations in this tale are not too dissimilar from those of the far more contemporary Patricia Polacco.  Though the pictures here are nothing to go too crazy about, they do have a nice feel to them.  I admired the delicate embroidery work on the old woman's hem and headscarf.  I liked the endpapers of the book, colored in with lush green trees and sunny spaces.  Hogrogian uses a nice full pallete of colors that cover the entire rainbow without ever becoming gaudy or intense.<br />The book also struck me as very familiar when I first read it.  That shouldn't be too surprising when you consider that it is based on an old old fable.  The most recent version of it that I have seen in picture book form is \\"The Bossy Gallito\\" by L.M. Gonzalez.  Personally, I prefer Gonzalez's version.  This Caldecott award winning book is all well and good in its way, but it hasn't the zip or verve of the gallito's tale.  Just my two cents.<br />Unless you've huge objections to fairy tale conventions like cut-off tails, there shouldn't be anything in this book to offend or distract you.  It is all very pleasant in its way.  As Caldecott winners go, there are better and bigger books than this out there with flashier pictures and fabulous words.  This book by comparison is rather small and unassuming.  Just the same, I suspect that it is greatly loved by a great many children in the world.pictures and fabulous words.

Rumor has it that the number one least appreciated and fantastic fantasy writer of the English language in the United States is Diana Wynne Jones.  Rumor also has it that one of her best written works (little known) is the delightful \\"Dogsbody\\".  Truthfully, I hadn't heard anyone give this book any credit until I decided to work my way through all the great unknown children's books.  This book falls squarely into the slightly more adult kids fare (as will be explained) but that doesn't stop it from being a really wonderful work of art.  This is one of those book gems one often wishes they could find but so rarely do.  Beautifully written, it's a classic.<br /><br />The great Dog Star Sirius is on trial for his life.  Though we puny humans don't know it, the stars, planets, and even satellites have their own distinct lives and actions.  When Sirius finds that he has been falsely accused of murder, he is sentenced to live out his days as a real honest-to-goodness dog on Earth.  If he can locate a weapon of mass destruction belonging to the Luminaries that has fallen to earth and retrieve it in his doggie state, he will be returned to his original form.  This is not only a story about learning to control one's own actions, but a touching tale of a girl and her not so ordinary pup.<br /><br />Originally published in 1975, the book is one of those stories that make you sit up and say, \\"huh?\\".  Where did Diana Wynne Jones even get this idea?  Reading through this book I got the same feeling I received as when I saw the movie, \\"Being John Malcovich\\".  Mainly, a sense of \\"how could a person think this up?\\".  As it is, the book could easily have fallen victim to its fantasy elements.  Instead, it's a wonderful tale of pet love.  Both dogs AND cats get a fair amount of attention in this tale, so don't fear.  Just because the hero is in a dog's body, that doesn't mean felines are naturally made out to be the villains.  What's really a joy about this book is the amount of time the author spends on Sirius's dog nature verses his luminary nature.  From interesting smells to a female dog in heat (nothing graphic occurs, so qwitcherbelliaking) we truly understand what a canine must go through every day of its life.<br /><br />Jones is just as canny with her human subjects as she is with her animal or ethereal ones as well.  Sirius is rescued as a puppy from a river by a young Northern Irish girl named Kathleen.  The girl lives with her aunt, uncle and two cousins (all of whom are English).  Though her cousins act as boys are wont to do (they're neither villains nor saints, that's for sure) and her uncle is kindly but distant, Kathleen's aunt is the real terror in her life.  A prejudiced mean Irish-hating creature, she takes a special delight in tormenting her unwanted charge.  Only Sirius's presence keeps Kathleen happy and sane, though the threat of being put to sleep hangs over his head as long as Aunt Duffie is around.  What I loved about all the people in this story was their capacity for change.  Basil, the elder of Kathleen's two cousins, appears to be a real beast at first.  He teases Sirius and occasionally lashes out at him, but it's clear that this is just the boy's misguided way of showing affection.  No one is irredeemable in this book (though two rougue luminaries hunting for Sirius in his dog-form come close).  Even the mythical being that appears at the end of the tale (Earth's darkest son) inspires more pity than fear.<br /><br />If you want a good dog story and you don't mind a bit of fantasy as well, then I just can't recommend \\"Dogsbody\\" enough.  Somebody ought to film this book.  Better yet, author Jones should seriously consider writing a sequel.  Though to the best of my knowledge no sequel was ever written, this book leaves itself wide-open for future furry adventures.  For any kid who has ever loved an animal, this book is a standout, a knockout, and a sure-fire crowd pleaser.  The best I've read in a long long time.author spends on Sirius's dog nature verses his luminary nature.  From interesting smells to a female dog in heat (nothing graphic occurs, so qwitcherbelliaking) we truly understand what a canine must go through every day of its life.  <BR> <BR>Jones is just as canny with her human subjects as she is with her animal or ethereal ones as well.  Sirius is rescued as a puppy from a river by a young Northern Irish girl named Kathleen.  The girl lives with her aunt, uncle and two cousins (all of whom are English).  Though her cousins act as boys are wont to do (they're neither villains nor saints, that's for sure) and her uncle is kindly but distant, Kathleen's aunt is the real terror in her life.  A prejudiced mean Irish-hating creature, she takes a special delight in tormenting her unwanted charge.  Only Sirius's presence keeps Kathleen happy and sane, though the threat of being put to sleep hangs over his head as long as Aunt Duffie is around.  What I loved about all the people in this story was their capacity for change.  Basil, the elder of Kathleen's two cousins, appears to be a real beast at first.  He teases Sirius and occasionally lashes out at him, but it's clear that this is just the boy's misguided way of showing affection.  No one is irredeemable in this book (though two rougue luminaries hunting for Sirius in his dog-form come close).  Even the mythical being that appears at the end of the tale (Earth's darkest son) inspires more pity than fear.  <BR> <BR>If you want a good dog story and you don't mind a bit of fantasy as well, then I just can't recommend \\"Dogsbody\\" enough.  Somebody ought to film this book.  Better yet, author Jones should seriously consider writing a sequel.  Though to the best of my knowledge no sequel was ever written, this book leaves itself wide-open for future furry adventures.  For any kid who has ever loved an animal, this book is a standout, a knockout, and a sure-fire crowd pleaser.  The best I've read in a long long time.	2004-05-26
654974:US	49148452	R2HB586AQJ16A0	078680646X	489526198	Mama Does the Mambo	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Hey mambo!	Every child wants to believe that his or her mother is the prettiest in the world.  That no eye can compare to her, nor any other mother for that matter.  In \\"Mama Does the Mambo\\", we watch a mother who was once most beautiful when she was dancing.  The book is a delicately structured tale of how families must adapt and change as their situations change as well.<br /><br />Sofia's mother hasn't danced since her Papa died.  Living in Havana, Sofia's parents would cut a rug any chance that they got.  They could do the merengue, the tango, the rumba, and the chachacha.  The dance Mama loved the best, however, was the mambo.  Now Sofia's Papa is dead and her mother never dances any more.  People in the neighborhood keep hinting that her mother should find a new dance partner.  Sofia is fairly certain that no one but Papa could dance with her mother, and this is confirmed by the appearance of Eduardo.  Sofia and Eduardo get along splendidly and his courtship of her mom is slow and delicate.  Unfortunately, Eduardo can't dance to save his soul.  Sofia knows that for the next Carnival her mother must must must dance.  Come Carnival, dance her Mama does, but not necessarily the way that Sofia had planned.<br /><br />This story doesn't focus its attention on how well Sofia and Eduardo get along, though that is undoubtedly one of the many threads keeping the narrative together.  So you won't necessarily be able to pidgeonhole this book as a \\"new parent\\" tale.  Instead, the drama of this book comes with its focus squarely on Sofia's mother.  Her grief for her lost husband is evident primarily in her lack of movement and rhythm.  Maybe she wants to dance, but it's hard to do so after losing a partner as wonderful as her husband was.  What Sofia is able to do is to help her mother accept his loss and act in his stead as her mother's new partner, daughter though she may be.  The final parting shot of the two women spinning and dancing is a wonderful mother/daughter moment that far more treacly and sugary picture books have attempted to present and have failed.<br /><br />Katherine Leiner's text is wonderfully paced.  The book begins with an acknowledgement immediately that Sofia's father has died.  We then get some wonderful memories and flashbacks of him in his life (how he died is never mentioned).  Later, it is clear that Eduardo is a great guy.  A pity he can't dance.  Accompanying this book are Edel Rodriguez's pastel, gouache, spray painted illustrations.  These pictures throb with life and energy.  I was especially taken with a section of four pictures displaying Sofia's parents doing four different dances.  Should you wish to know the difference between a tango and a rumba, these pics may help.  Most impressive, to me anyway, was the picture of the green/blue streets of Havana found in the book's endpapers.  This is a truly beautiful book to pick up and view.<br /><br />I'm fascinated by the negative reviews this book has garnered.  It almost seems as if I've read a book that's completely different from that of the other reviewers.  Where they were bored, I was entranced.  Where they moan about how the setting seems too researched to be real, I not only read but felt the entrancing locations and colors of the tale.  Most interesting is the reviewer who feels that this book is a deliberate rip-off of someone else's story.  I can't comment on that, since I honestly don't know the details.  They may be completely correct in their assessment or they may be mistaken.  Whatever the case, if the original \\"author\\" of the tale is able to pen anything half as colorful, eclectic, and a fun as this book, they'll have done a great job.  \\"Mama Does the Mambo\\" is a sweet tale about making changes in one's life.  The interactions between the characters are worth the price of admission alone.  If you like a little high-stepping action in your picture books (or you wish to infuse your child's world with such images) you can do no better than to readthem this book.  It's a jolt of pure energy disguised as a dance.book.  It's a jolt of pure energy disguised as a dance.	2004-05-25

It is the number one bedtime story parents have sought out for years and years and years.  It is colorful and sober.  Elegant and peachy keen.  The truth of the matter?  I was never too attached to \\"Goodnight Moon\\" as a child.  Raised on a diet of Steven Kellogg and Richard Scary I had a hard time adjusting to the low key murmurs and repetitive phrases of this most ancient of picture books.  Looking at it now I am bowled over by its original publication date.  1947.  Amazing.  Who would or could have thought that this little unprepossessing story would come to win the hearts and minds of as many millions of parents and children as it has?  And, more importantly, continues to do so.<br /><br />You all know the story but I'm going to sum it up for you anyway.  There is a bunny.  It is attempting to go to sleep as an unnamed old lady says hush.  The viewer is given the chance to look and and peruse the various objects around the room.  Everything from the two kittens on the rug to a brightly lit little toyhouse.  As we watch, the shadows lengthen and the room grows dimmer.  Time on the clock passes.  Finally, the restless little hare resigns itself to sleep and even the kittens cuddle together in the still quiet night.<br /><br />Brown has written the book with enough simple but easy-to-understand words for your average preschooler.  I have always felt that the point in the book where she cheats a little is when she writes, \\"Goodnight comb, and goodnight brush, goodnight nobody, goodnight mush\\".  Goodbye nobody? Surely something could have been drawn there instead of a blank page.  Nonetheless, it is not a boring book.  Sleepifying, yes.  Drowsy-making, yes.  But not dull.  As I've said, it is not my favorite children's picture book, but even I can see that it is well-constructed and well-written too.  With the derth of really effective bedtime books out there that have the ability to put you to sleep on purpose, a title like, \\"Goodnight Moon\\" stands out with its simple methodical goodnights.e like, \\"Goodnight Moon\\" stands out with its simple methodical goodnights.	2004-05-25

In the case of Yoshiko Uchida, the notable Japanese-American children's author has made her career in writing about Japanese, Japanese-Americans, and their place in history.  With \\"The Invisible Thread\\" the author has decided to write a work that is a little more personal.  This autobiography marks a departure for Uchida, leaving behind the fictional past for the real one.  In it, kids learn first-hand about a particularly shameful (and shamingly recent) chapter in America's history: the degrading Japanese internment camps.<br /><br />A good author writing about a catastrophic event leads up to the moment cautiously.  If you're showing a difficult moment in a person's (or persons') life, you don't just run headlong into the moment without giving a little background first.  In this way, Uchida sets the stage for the reader.  Yoshiko grew up as a second generation Japanese-American in California in the 1930s.  Born of parents that had both immigrated to the United States separately, Yoshiko was privileged to live in a fairly well-to-do area in Berkley, California.  Living with Japanese ancestry in the U.S. at that time was not an easy thing, but Yoshika was hardly about to challenge the system.  As we watch the author grows up, goes to college, and makes numerous friends.  Her life, such as it was, was fairly uneventful.  Then, just about halfway through the book Pearl Harbor is bombed and everything changes.  Yoshiko and her family are sent packing from their beloved home (and dog) to temporary quarters in an old racing track.  The story picks up as she learns to teach and exist in her new environment, detailing the dehumanizing effect that such living has on human beings.<br /><br />What I liked about this book was the real sense one got of the difference the America of that time and the American of today.  Uchida puts it best herself in a passage found in the chapter, \\"Prisoner of My Country\\".  In this passage she writes:<br /><br />\\"Resistance or confrontation such as we know them today was unthinkable, for the world then was a totally different place.  There had been no freedom marches or demonstrations of protest.  No one had yet heard of Martin Luture King, Jr.  No one knew about ethnic pride.  Most Americans were not concerned about civil rights and would not have supported us had we tried to resist the uprooting\\".<br />Educators using this book today could easily point out that though we are not interning people of Middle Eastern descent today, we are certainly not making America a place that is much more hospitable today than it was for the Japanese at that time.  The book is a useful tool for placing a moment in American history within its context.  I was especially thrilled to find that there are additional resources and books listed in a neat bibliography for both kids and adults wanting to know more about Japanese internment camps.  What is remarkable is that the book makes the event real to the reader, allowing us to feel a little of what the author, her family, and friends went through at the time.  In the end, Uchida is an accomplished writer that knows exactly how to bring children into a dangerous past without horrifying them with too many of the details.  It is a delicate line to walk and Uchida treads it with the utmost care.book was the real sense one got of the difference the America of that time and the American of today.

After LeVar Burton introduced the child viewers to the nature of farms and farm life we listened to a reading of this book and I took a great deal of pleasure in its pictures and storytelling.  Unfortunately, television was then (and remains today to be) incapable of displaying this book properly.  Like all Kellogg illustrated creations, the story is filled to the brim with tiny delightful details that compete with one another for the viewer's attention.  Reading this book on my own some twenty odd years later, I can finally settle down and enjoy this combination of delicate text and fantastic illustrations as I was menat to all those years ago.<br /><br />A girl comes home to make herself a sandwich and chat with her mom after a long day on a class trip to the farm.  The girl's story works backwards at the beginning.  Slowly, tantalizingly, she leaks out the details of the trip.  After all, it didn't really get exciting until the cow started crying.  When asked, the girl admits that the cow was crying because the farmer hit a haystack on top of her.  Why did he do that?  Well, he was distracted by the pigs that had overrun the bus.  And so it goes.  Slowly the mother gets the full story of how fellow classmate Jimmy took his boa constrictor (a dew-eyed sweetie pie of a snake) to the farm and how all havok broke loose as a result.  In the end, Jimmy left the boa there and adopted one of the pigs that never left the bus.  The parting shot is of our narrator, suited up with Jimmy in silver racing outfits, barreling down a park path with the new pet pig in the back seat.<br />Kids reading this story get the double pleasure of watching chaos reigning in a farm setting and of reading a rollicking good story.  Is there anything a kid likes more than to see a teacher covered in eggs?  Or to view the cute animals that make up the farm?  Kellogg has a way of drawing cats that I've never seen paralled.  Who else could draw wide-eyed smiling felines as well as he does?  Jimmy and the narrator apparently have a class of only eight children, so as the book progresses you can see how each person reacts to each and every situation.  Kellogg isn't afraid of multiculturalism either, making the book a nice read-aloud for a variety of audiences.  Originally published in 1980, you do have to contend with the clothing, an odd combination of 80s fashion and 70s hair, but that's the book's sole flaw (if it can even be called that).<br />If you have kids that enjoy reading about fiascos (and this is an especially brilliant higgledy-piggledy fiasco if ever there was one) then this book's a pip.  From the flying eggs, to the screams of the farmer's wife, to the slow exhaustion of the school's bus driver, it reads brilliantly.  Credit Trinka Hakes Noble's witty retelling in a format not usually found in children's literature.  Altogether the combination of eloquent text and amusing pictures place this book in the higher echelons of picture books.  A brilliant, fun, and rousing book.mals that make up the farm?

Her adventures tend to be as large or small as the daily activites that children themselves partake in.  Appearing in cleverly constructed (and mighty strong) books, Maisy is cheery without ever becoming pendatic.  She's light-hearted but never tiring.  Maisy is, in fact, the perfect companion for any child beginning to read.  She is also a great help to those parents that want their kids to see reading as a fun activity.<br /><br />In this particular Maisy venture, the little white mouse wants to go swimming.  The weather outside must be frightful because our heroine is covered from tip to tail in warm woolly winter clothing.  It is up to the child reader to remove each article as instructed.  So off goes the hat!  Open goes the coat.  Away goes the sweater, the trousers (love those Lucy Cousins British words), t-shirt, socks, and bright orange underwear.  Then the child places the swimsuit onto Maisy and off goes the cheery mousey for a dip in the pool.<br /><br />The book's a treat, no question.  Parents reading it to their children had better put the book back together correctly before another reading, however.  No child would want to read through a book where Maisy's hat was already off or her swimsuit was already on.  That would spoil half the fun.  The trick of removing or outfitting Maisy in these articles of clothing come in the book's clever construction.  Using thick paper that can stand up to little hands, it's a treat to watch Cousins's thick lined drawings moving up or down.  The only part of the book that's a bit flimsy is, sadly the last picture.  In theory, if you pull on a specific tab, Lucy goes bobbing along in the water.  In practice, she's more likely to get stuck, or the tab may just get pulled out altogether.  On the whole however, this a cute creation.  Any child who's a fan of Cousins, mice, or just the trick or interacting with a book's character physically will have a ball with Maisy's small scale adventure.  A bucket o' fun.	2004-05-20
660707:US	49148452	RWDK3C4QE29DZ	0385730284	443629566	A Great and Terrible Beauty (The Gemma Doyle Trilogy)	Books	3	253	318	N	N	60% great, 20% terrible, 20% beautiful	What, in your opinion, is more important: What an author has to say or how an author chooses to say it?  Take, for example, Libby Bray's, \\"A Great and Terrible Beauty\\".  Set in a Victorian era girl's boarding school, the book has the uneasy task of having a great voice and yet not much in the way of a plot.  Bray struggles to weave together the different components that made up (wealthy) women's lives in 19th century Britain.  At times she is exceedingly gifted.  At others, she falls short of the mark.<br /><br />Gemma Doyle was born and raised in India with her mother, father, and brother.  Having just turned sixteen she is like any other adolescent girl, getting into squabbles with her mom and pouting that she cannot go to live in England.  Deliverance for Gemma comes as a very mixed blessing when she witnesses her mother's suicide (in a vision, no less) and is sent to an all-girl's finishing school outside of London.  Falling into the usual petty squabbles of popularity and independence, Gemma eventually comes to realize that there is more to the Spence Academy, and herself, than she could ever have known.  In a madcap tale of gypsies, magical powers, and deep dark soul-sucking evil Gemma has to face up to her own personal demons as well as the very real spirits that wish her, and her friends, harm.<br /><br />One one level, this is just your typical romantic bodice-ripper complete with virile dangerous young men and the comedy of manners that set the standards so long ago.  Reading this book really seemed to me to be a kind of \\"The Craft\\" meets \\"The Little Princess\\".  Gemma befriends both popular and unpopular alike and much of the book dwells on the problems haunting each of her friends.  While Bray has an excellent voice for dialogue and situational comedy, I couldn't quite figure out what she was trying to say with her characters.  One minute the two popular girls, Pippa and Felicity, would be playing incredibly cruel tricks on their classmates.  Next, Gemma is their best friend and they all bare their souls over cups of whiskey.  While the story really does make you feel as if these girls are getting closer, I found it very weird that when some of the girls go over the edge and deal in dark magics and (in a sense) murder, Gemma is perfectly willing to forgive them three pages later and never mention it again.  There is no blame in this novel, a thing I found peculiar (especially when you're dealing with sixteen year-olds).  When Gemma's friends get an innocent teacher fired, Gemma minds for maybe two hours and then, once more, forgets.<br /><br />Then there's the fact that we never meet the villain.  This book might have just as well plastered the words, \\"SEQUEL COMING SOON\\" on its cover for all that it alludes to future books.  It is very rare to read an entire book about a villain whose name appears from page seven onwards, and yet we never meet them even once.  The resolutions in this book are shaky at best and though the bookflap for \\"A Great and Terrible Beauty\\" states this this is \\"the story of a girl who saw another way\\" out of the standard roles written for women, by the end Gemma really hasn't changed anything in the least.<br /><br />And finally there are the gypsies.  Why is it that gypsies are always the standard ethnic group for magical doings?  There are actual gypsies in the world, you know.  This book, however, prefers the romantic version, choosing to forget that they are an actual culture with actual dealings in the world.  Turning gypsies into the mythical magical people that exist only in the minds of over-romanticizing white people not only does real gypsies a disservice but it makes books like this one offensive.  I won't even dwell on how Bray chose to display natives of India as well.  Let's just say this book reads best if you like rooting for Anglo-Saxons.<br /><br />I'm being harsh on this book, and for good reason.  Bray is capable of wonderful writing.  The slow building threat of Gemma's situation,and the fact that she is repeatedly told to cease and desist all magic or pay the consequences, all this is very good and dark.  Unfortunately, there's never a payoff at the end.  The gypsy Kartik tells Gemma to stop or else, but he never makes good on his threat.  Gemma never really pays for anything she's done either.  I was so confused by what was good and bad in this story that I spent three quarters of the book believing that Gemma's mother, for all intents and purposes, was an illusion or an evil creature in disguise.  That's just me, but in all other ways the book is very bad at rewarding the reader for slogging through the foreshadowing.  And boy oh boy is there a LOT of foreshadowing.  In any case, I think with a little rewriting this could have been an excellent novel.  Unfortunately, we'll never know now.<br /><br />None of this is to say that \\"A Great and Terrible Beauty\\" isn't a great read.  It really is exciting and interesting.  I'm simply warning you that it is possible that you might feel a little let down or cheated at the end.  The climaxes never climax as much as they could.  The fearful moments are never quite fearful enough.  It's a book of halfs, never a whole.  But for any reader who wants to dwell in the darkness a little and read a tale about a girl who has the capability of giving herself a great deal of power, go to it.

This particular tale focuses on a bear, his small unassuming quest, and the girl that eventually becomes his friend.  The book feels more like, \\"The Velveteen Rabbit\\" than \\"Toy Story\\", but kids will quickly come to enjoy (or at the very least, understand) Corduroy's wish for a child to love him.<br /><br />Living in a department store with other toys and dolls, Corduroy is a stuffed teddy bear in overalls.  One day a doe-eyed girl and her patient mama spot the bear and the child is instantly entranced.  Unfortunately, her mother points out that the bear is a little worn down and is even missing one of the buttons on its overalls.  Upon hearing this, the bear is distressed and resolves to, that night, locate the missing item.  After taking an unexpected ride up the escalator, Corduroy finds himself in the store's bedding area.  He tries (unsuccessfully) to prise a button off of a nearby mattress, but succeeds only in alerting the local night watchman to his presence.  The next day, however, the girl returns with her own allowance money and quick as a wink purchases the bear, missing button and all.  She even sews a new button back onto his overalls, and the two are fast friends.<br /><br />The book, when you look at it closely, almost seems to resemble a series of woodcuts, painted with watercolors later.  I don't know if this was the case, but if so the author/artist, Don Freedman, is certainly adept.  I've never seen woodcut faces as well presented as the ones here.  People are smooth and rounded, and Freedman apparently doesn't have any problems with round curves.  Moreover, I was impressed that the little girl and her mother that view Corduroy are black.  Originally published in 1968, this was a bit of a big deal back in the day.<br />Today, the story of the little bear who wanted a friend is as poignant and simplistic in its telling as it was when first it came out.  Anyone who read (or had read to them) this book as a child will instantly remember the scene of Corduroy tugging and tugging the button on the mattress in an attempt to remove it for himself.  It's a sweet story all in all.  I think people feel a great deal of affection for \\"Corduroy\\" because they can identify with the little unwanted fuzzy guy.

A prequel to the previously popular and delightful \\"Ginger\\", Charlotte Voake's, \\"Ginger Finds a Home\\", gives us a little background information about one very special house cat.  While in \\"Ginger\\" the cat is a fat comfortable fellow with little time for the ragtag mechanisms of a new kitten, in \\"Ginger Finds a Home\\" our hero is a skinny alley cat who doesn't know where his next meal is coming from.<br />The Ginger here is a wild thin creature that lives at the end of a garden.  He never knows where he'll be getting his next meal.  One day, Ginger finds a plate of cat food waiting for him to eat.  The next day, when he goes back to the same spot he sees his benefactress, a little girl.  Soon a trust grows between the two (slowly and with time) and eventually the girl invites Ginger home.  The cat easily grows skittish in the new environment and the little girl is distraught, fearing she's pushed him too far.  But the cat comes back and now the two live together peacefully with Ginger visiting his patch at the end of the garden to sunbathe only.<br />It's nice to see a story that talks of patience and slow understanding.  Voake is an adept writer and though I felt this wasn't quite as satisfying a story as \\"Ginger\\", the book has a charm all of its own.  Ginger is quite full and healthy looking at the end of the book, though his tail remains as skinny and raggedy as ever.  Owners of their own cats will be pleased to note that the little girl knows exactly how to hold Ginger, carefully placing an arm underneath his lower legs when she picks him up.  Those readers who chose to glance at the author's note on the back inside flap (aside from seeing a parting shot of a happy Ginger in his cat basket) may be delighted to find that the story is based on a real Ginger who decided to live with the Voake family in England.  Truth be told, there is a rather English flavor to the book.  It is both understated and touching.  In the end, a perfect compliment of tones make \\"Ginger Finds a Home\\" an excellent edition to any home library.  For the cat lovers of the world, it's a keeper.e book.

Ladies and gentlemen I direct your attention this evening to \\"The Day the Babies Crawled Away\\".  Now this is a tale told entirely in silhouette.  It is accomplished and witty, ending with a touch of sentiment that brings an actual honest-to-goodness tear to the eye.  And yet what did author Peggy Rathmann win the Caldecott Award for?  For the phenomenally less deserving and trite, \\"Officer Buckle and Gloria\\".  A fine book, but not even a hair close to the brilliance of this, her latest text.<br /><br />The book begins in the early morning.  A fair is being set up next to a group of houses.  The narration speaks to the reader.<br /> \\"Remember the day<br /> The babies crawled away?\\"<br /> And later...<br /> \\"Remember the way<br /> You tried to save the day?\\"<br /> So we follow our protagonist, a boy in a fireman's helmet as he frantically follows five fast moving babies.  The boy follows them from the woods, to the swamps, into caves and on ledges.  The babies find themselves in perilous situations, and the intrepid young boy must find a way to save them all and get them back home safe and sound.  When he returns to the fairgrounds, babies in tow, the grown-ups cheer him soundly.  That night, boy and babies fall asleep in their parents' arms after a long and exhausting day.<br /><br />It sounds cutesy, no question, and it isn't.  Not in the least.  First of all, technically it's remarkably adept.  The silhouettes are so detailed and delicate that you find yourself discovering all sorts of tiny details on every page.  Is that Officer Buckle and Gloria on the title page?  Is the trophy given to the boy at the end topped with a pie?  And how did Rathmann draw an exploding water balloon so well in silhouette?  Looking at the babies, you can see that each one is differently drawn.  There's the bonnet baby, the baby with one curl, the cornrows baby, the dredlocks baby, and the smallest baby of all that spends almost all of this book upside down.  Rathmann uses the silhouette technique to her own advantage at critical times.  When the babies collapse as a sleepy pile on top of their boy rescuer, the viewer can only make out a hand here, a heel there, and a wild assortment of perching birds, butterflies, and frogs.  As for the text, it really does give credit where credit is due.  The boy has saved the babies and as a reward we are shown a scene that touched me deeply.  The boy sits on his mother's lap in the fading evening light.  His fireman's hatted head is tipped gently towards his mama who is kissing him sweetly.  In her hair, a butterly perches and the book says, \\"You told me your story, I brewed you some tea, then you fell fast asleep in a small pile on me\\"  It's enough to break your heart.<br /><br />And I haven't even gushed to you about the shifting colors of the day from early morning to the bright light of noon, and eventually the cool colors of twilight.  For a book that deals up a healthy heaping of black, this is one of the most colorful (and lovely) picture books out there today.  There's something about a story in which a toddler can be the ultimate hero that appeals deeply to children.  The adults (incapacitated by a pie-eating contest) are useless here and it is up to a small boy to save the day.  Rathmann had always struck me as the poor man's Steven Kellogg until now.  With \\"The Day the Babies Crawled Away\\", I think she's really come into her own.  It is perhaps the most charming toddler empowerment book I have ever seen.  More importantly, it is simultaneously witty and beautiful.  With so few books managing to be either one or the other, we should be careful to praise the few (like this one) that are both.upside down.

Not, as you may have guessed, a book in the famous \\"The Cat Who\\" series by Lillian Jackson Braun.  Instead, this is a simple tale of a man and his cat.  Stories of this ilk are nine times out of ten relegated to the dogs of the world.  We can find a million \\"a man and his dog\\" books out there, so it is that much more impressive when the companion of the tale is a little more feline.  Author Terry Farish, previously disposed to writing books for young adults, and the remarkable Barry Root have teamed together to bring us a story of good old-fashioned friendship and bonding.<br /><br />The book begins, \\"There was an old man, an ol' Texas boy, country-raised, don't you know\\".  He lives alone with his cat, to whom he is very attached, \\"but not so's you'd notice\\".  Man and cat live a nice peaceful life.  When the man goes out to fish, the cat sits on the prow of the boat, though she never catches anything.  Truthfully, she's never caught a thing in her whole life, a fact that the man brings up regularly.  But they share bowls of potato soup together and are quite contented with their lot.  You get the distinct feeling that the man is retired and that this is how he prefers to spend his days.  One day, the man finds that the cat is still sleeping when he's ready to go fishing.  Not one to wait too long, he leaves without her, reasoning that he doesn't need her.  When the cat wakes to find the man gone (a thing that has never occurred before) she leaves home.  The man comes back to an empty home and for three days the cat does not return.  One day he comes home and there's the cat on the porch, one paw on the biggest fish you ever did see.  The cat howls her story, which the man picks up on pretty well, and at long last the two are back in the goods.  \\"And he loved the sight of her, oh, and this time you'd notice\\".  And in time the cat forgives the man and, \\"then came sweet peace\\".<br /><br />There's a tone to the dialogue and text of this book that's as easy and pleasant on the ear as you could hope for in a picture book.  The man, for his part, is the type to mutter words like, \\"Fool cat. You ain't nobody's prize. Never killed nothin'\\".  These two could be living anywhere in the continental United States, honestly.  The man's grouchy, but he's never downright mean, and the cat matches him in spirit, sticking up for herself when she needs to.  Alone, the book's a great read.  Paired with Root's illustrations, it's a dream come true.  Barry Root has somehow captured the feel and tone of this story perfectly.  From the man's small ramshackle little house (note the toilet bowl under the mailbox that reads, \\"Junk mail\\") to that baseball cap the man always wears, to the truck he drives.  Heck, I even liked box of Kleenex that sits forlornly on the man's dining room table.  If I have any problems with the pictures in this book, perhaps Roots didn't make the man as curmudgeonly looking as he is in the text.  But this is a minor/ tiny/ petty/ miniscule complaint.  The book's a fantastic looking piece of work.  Though you never learn the name of either the man or the cat, you don't need to.  They stand on their own well enough.  And this isn't a book about some grand rich person or even a person who works in a professional manner.  This is about a guy who'd like nothing better than to live on his own with his cat and to go fishing every day.  Remarkably, it makes fantastic reading for the young ones.<br />The best way to tell if you're going to like this book or not is to just take a gander at the cover.  Blow it up big so that you can get a good long look at it.  If the shot of that cat (her mouth smiling and the man in the back of the boat) doesn't appeal to you then you probably won't enjoy this book.  But if you like cats or men or just honest straightforward storytelling, then this is the book for you.  It does not aim beyond its station, but it's a strong well-told tale that you could read again and again and get a little more out of every time.  I wish that all picture books could do half as much.ime.  I wish that all picture books could do half as much.	2004-05-20

What I found was a book that was a little like \\"The Secret Garden\\" and a little like the beginning of \\"The Wolves of Willoughby Chase\\".  It is, all in all, a very pleasant story about a boy and his ghostly companions.  There are brief moments of conflict, but on the whole only good things happen to the protagonist.  For children, this is an excellent introduction into the world of mysterious goings on.<br /><br />Toseland (or Tolly for short) has just been sent by his father in Burma to live with his great-grandmother in jolly old England.  Tolly is a little nervous, not knowing quite what to expect.  What he finds is a magical castle called Green Noah, presided over by a loving kindly grandmother.  But strange dealings occur in the house when Tolly arrives.  A snatch of laughter here, reflected children's faces there, and inanimate objects that have the tendency of coming to life.  To Tolly's delight there are three children in the castle, cheery ghosts of siblings that lost their lives in the Great Plague.  Don't expect any meanderings on the meaning of life after death, or any explanations for that matter.  The children are perfectly happy flitting about from inside to outside, and in time they and Tolly become good friends.  It is only the malevolent presence of the nasty gypsy-cursed tree Green Noah that keeps Tolly from perfect happiness.<br /><br />When you pick up a book in which a veritable orphan is being sent to live with previously unknown relatives, you usually do not find an idyllic situation.  Anne of \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" had her problems.  So did the Baudelaire orphans of \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\".  Which makes Tolly's story all the more interesting.  For quite a while I was convinced that there would be no real conflict at any point.  Tolly's days are fun, improving when he comes to know the children better.  Reading this book, I was reminded of my own childhood days and the millions of ways kids can find to have fun on their own.  When Green Noah makes his appearance in the tale he is a truly odd spectacle.  I was delighted to find, however, that when the tree decides to blindly come after Tolly it is a moment of real heart-stopping terror.<br />The writing in this book may strike some as a little pendantic.  So I cannot say whole-heartedly that every child will like it.  But some will love it, I can tell.  L.M. Boston is the kind of author who can write deeply evocative sentences in a children's book and never appear ridiculous for it.  I was particularly taken with a passage that read, \\"In front of him the world was an unbroken dazzling cloud of crystal stars, except for the moat, which looked like a strip of night that had somehow sinned and had no stars in it\\".  The book is full of beautiful lines like this one, yet it retains the interest of the child reader.<br />Kids who like fantasy but find some books a little too scary or nerve wracking might take to \\"The Children of Greene Knowe\\" very readily.  Any kid who has loved Frances Burnett, Edward Eagar, or E. Nesbit will adore this story.  Get `em while they're young and they may even wish to read this book's multiple sequels.

The book strives to present East African lifestyles for the viewer using a technique that produces the 24 letters of the Swahili alphabet.  Each letter is the beginning of a word in Swahili, and the text and pictures illustrate how this word fits into the daily interactions of Eastern Africans.  From the \\"A\\" of arusi (a wedding) to the Z of the zeze (a stringed instrument) the reader is given a series of interesting situations and illustrations.<br /><br />Now when this book first came out it was unique in its field.  Since the 1970s, however, our standards for non-fiction picture books have risen a little and \\"Jambo Means Hello\\" is not necessarily the best book of its kind anymore.  Looking at it today is an interesting exercise in changing perceptions.  First of all, I'd like to commend author Muriel Feelings for her incredibly informative Introduction.  Producing a map of Africa that clearly delineates the countries where Swahili is the primary language, she explains about the continent, the people, and the fact that Swahili hasn't a Q or X sound.  The book then enters into the letters, accompanied by Tom Feelings's pencil and ink drawings.  These pictures are entirely respectful of their subjects.  People, objects, and the land itself are presented beautifully here.  Though the illustrations are all black and white, you do not feel the lack of color is a loss of any kind.<br /><br />I haven't any problems with the illustrations of this book, but I do feel that the text is a bit outdated at times.  First of all, the author makes rather grand sweeping statements about East Africans, lumping them all into a group and making it seem as if people from the Congo partake in the same ceremonies, customs, and dress as the people of Somalia.  This is my primary problem with the book, but there are other small difficulties as well.  For one thing, there aren't any signs of modernization or contemporary attitudes in this book, which is odd.  Large cities and technological advances are pretty much ignored on the whole.  Then there is the introduction's statement that this book is specifically for children of African ancestry, as if kids from other cultures wouldn't get anything out of this collection.<br /><br />Still, these problems aren't huge and a little well-placed modernization and editing could eliminate them altogether.  Kids reading this book will delight to recognize such Swahili words as Rafiki (friend), remembering that charming monkey from \\"The Lion King\\".  They'll enjoy the elegant sweeping pictures and depictions.  An enjoyable (and greatly needed) book, this is certain to continue to garner fans as the years go by.  Though bigger better books exploring the nature of Africa and its inhabitants exist, I recommend you at least give a glance to the charming, \\"Jambo Means Hello\\".ntemporary attitudes in this book, which is odd.

By mistake, I accidentally picked up the first Martha book, \\"Martha Speaks\\", in which a clever canine who can speak (due to a healthy diet of alphabet soup) foils a burglar's plot.  The book was fine.  Not particularly different from any other, except perhaps that it used cartoonish bubbles to convey speech (not too common in picture books as of now).  So I returned it and located \\"Martha Calling\\" next.  To my chagrin, the book is not quite as good as its predecessor.  Yes, we still have that lovable puppy dog yabbering away and causing all sorts of kooky adventures, but the emotional impact found in the first book is lacking here.<br /><br />Martha's just as talky as ever, but her new favorite toy is undoubtedly the phone.  One day Martha's non-stop mouth helps her to win a radio contest.  The prize is a free weekend for four at the cozy Come-On-Inn.  Unfortunately, no dogs are allowed at the inn in question.  Disguising the dog as Grandma Martha, the week-end goes kablooey when a well-meaning housekeeper falls under the impression that Martha the dog has eaten Martha the Grandma.  After some explanations on our protagonist's part, all ends up well and the inn remodels itself as a dog-friendly establishment.<br /><br />Where in \\"Martha Speaks\\" we felt Martha's pain at being chastised for talking too much (a thing many children have to deal with once they themselves learn to talk), here the book is dealing with discrimination.  Somehow, the more serious subject matter is less effective in the long run.  There is plenty to be amused at in this book, no question.  But it's just fluff in the end.  Which is fine if all you're looking for is a bit of entertainment to read to the kiddies at night.  Martha is a fine pooch to watch and there are plenty of little tiny tidbits to catch the eye.  I was particularly taken with the final picture in the book of the many dogs and their owners dining at the now renamed Sit-n-Stay Hotel.  To one side a cat crouches, eyeing the other animals while its owner cries, \\"Leave those dogs alone Liebchen!\\".  I've suddenly been inspired to name my own cat Liebchen someday.  By the way, make sure you understand who the SPCA is before reading this book with the kiddies.  Martha mentions it more than once in her \\"No Dogs Allowed\\" anger.

The classic tale of how a single man is able, with the help of his clever friends, to fulfill every task the local ruler (in this case, the Czar) sets before him is both a pleasure to read and a joy to reread.  In the case of the 1968 edition of this story, illustrated by Uri Shulevitz, I can't say that this is the definitive version of the tale to read to your kids.  It's enjoyable, yes.  It has a nice text and it flows rather well.  Unfortunately, the illustrations are a bit lax and while the book is a good read, it doesn't endear itself as much as it might to the average child reader.<br /><br />In this book, there was once a boy who was a fool who had two elder brothers who were intelligent.  The Czar commands that whosoever brings before him a flying ship shall marry his daughter.  Intrigued, the elder brothers take off to do the deed and are never heard from again.  The fool also goes off and in his travels he meets a wise old man.  After sharing his repast, the old man gives the lad some strict instructions that sound ridiculous but ultimately lead to a beautiful flying ship.  Once the lad takes off he gathers with him every man he sees on the road, no matter how bizarre.  After landing in the Czar's backyard, the peasants on the ship do not sufficiently impress the lofty ruler.  He then proceeds to set a series of incredibly difficult tasks for the fool, but in the end the magic men and the boy overcome every last one.  Finally, the fool marries the princess and (as a result of his riches) is now handsome, clever, and impresses everyone he meets.  The end.<br /><br />Completely disregarding an ending where not only do the clothes make the man but wealth as well, the book is a good one.  Randsome has a nice grasp on the best ways in which to tell this tale, and the escalating silliness is impressive.  I don't wish to put down the art that illustrator Uri Shulevitz worked so hard to produce for the book, but let's face facts.  This is fairly bland stuff.  Drawn with rather sketchy pencils and lines, the book is adequate but by no means overwhelming.  The fool appears as an apple-cheeked young rapscallion but you don't really feel anything for him.  Undoubtedly there are those that have loved these pictures since their youth and will be deaf to any criticisms I might offer.  In such cases as those I'll merely say that should you wish to purchase this story, I recommend you sample other versions as well until you find just the right one.  I doubt you'd be disappointed by a little comparison shopping.  Though a fine creation and a loving book, it could do with a little pepping up in the art department.to produce for the book, but let's face facts.  This is fairly bland stuff.

Fans of Ezra Jack Keats's fabulous (and better known) 1962 book, \\"The Snowy Day\\" should be pleased to discover this other piece of Keatsian lore.  Published originally in 1964, \\"Whistle for Willie\\" is a sequel of sorts.  Starring Peter, that lovable kid whom we first saw tromping about in his red snowsuit, the focus shifts from cold snowed in city streets to warmer days in a kid-friendly metropolis.<br /><br />Peter would like to whistle.  He would like it very much, but try as he might he just cannot figure out how to do it.  Though Peter sees other kids whistling for their dogs, when Peter whistles for his dauchund Willie he finds he hasn't the skill.  We observe Peter as he goes about his day, trying to whistle between spinning, hiding in boxes, coloring with chalk, pretending to be his father, and walking the cracks in the sidewalk.  At long last, after many failed attempts, Peter successfully whistles for Willie.  Delighted, he shows his parents and after being sent to the grocery store he whistles all the way there and all the way back.<br /><br />First of all, this is the book to present to those people that believe that children's short attention spans are a new occurrence.  Observe, if you will, the multitude of activities and games Peter partakes in, usually leading back to his attempts to pucker up his lips and blow.  This is one active (though not necessarily hyper) kid.  You have to like Peter, just as you have to like the story in which he has been placed.  It's a nice one, with realistic dialog and funny moments for kids to enjoy.  When Peter puts on his dad's hat and pretends to be him, his mom plays right along.  There's a real sense of trust to this book as well.  Undoubtedly some kids living in big cities might read this and wonder why their own moms don't let them run in the streets alone or walk to the store to get some groceries.  Prepare to unleash the dreaded phrase, \\"It was a simpler time\\" in such events.  As for Keats's illustrations, they are as rambunctious and amusing as ever.  I was particularly taken with a scene in which Peter spins himself around and around then suddenly stops.  As we watch, the whole world tilts back and forth, the stoplight's lights floating out of their base and Peter swinging his arms to stay upright. As always, the textures, background prints, and clors in this book are fabulous.  And in an improvement on \\"Snowy Day\\", Peter and his dog are allowed facial expressions where once Peter had none.<br /><br />From the subtle endpapers to the beautiful and bizarre artistic graffiti on the walls, this book is a big city hit.  Anyone who has ever wanted to experience the metropolitan districts with a small child as their guide would do well to snatch and grab the admirable, \\"Whistle for Willie\\".

In those 26 years I've learned a lot about children's books.  I've learned which ones are considered the holiest of holies and which are to be condemned and spat upon.  So I was completely taken aback when I learned that there was a 1938 children's book that absolutely no one had ever told me to read before.  \\"Mr. Popper's Penguins\\" was a delight to discover.  Suddenly I was privy to reading a charming story of a man and his penguins, and I had never even heard a peep about this tale from anyone.  What gives?  Why isn't \\"Mr. Popper's Penguins\\" as well-known and well-read as \\"Cheaper by the Dozen\\" or \\"Stuart Little\\"?  There is no answer to this question.  There is only this wonderful book, well-illustrated and magnificently written for the younger set.<br /><br />Mr. Popper is a house painter, and mostly a good one.  True, he does sometimes fall into fits of fancy, dreaming about the Arctic explorers and the ice floes to the North and South.  His wife and children don't necessarily understand his dreams, but that doesn't sway Mr. Popper.  One day, out of the blue, he receives word that one of the great explorers he wrote, Admiral Drake, read his letter and is sending him a present.  As any child who remembers the title of the book might guess, a penguin comes hopping out of a newly delivered crate the next day.  Mr. Popper is charmed by the little guest, and names him Captain Cook.  Cook is a curious beasty, and the Poppers do everything from outfitting their refrigerator to taking Captain Cook for walks.  When the penguin falls into a deep depression it is only the delivery of a second penguin from the zoo, Gerta, that cheers him up.  Soon the penguin pair lay some eggs and the Popper household is privy to ten more lovely jumpy penguins.  With money hard to come by it takes a clever Mr. Popper to come up with a way to make his penguins not only profitable, but stars.<br /><br />First of all, make certain that if you are reading a version of this story that you have grabbed one that has Robert Lawson's beautiful illustrations.  The same illustrator that's responsible for the lovable picture book, \\"Ferdinand the Bull\\" has switched his focus from beef to fowl.  These penguins are remarkably well drawn, from their inquisitive little eys to their ugly webbed feet.  If you've never seen a Lawson illustration, here would be a good place to start.  The writing of Richard and Florence Atwater is extremely readable for anyone of any age.  The phrase, \\"they just don't make `em like that anymore\\" is unfair, but also kind of true.  There's something to the simplicity of this book that you just can't find anywhere else.  It is, all in all, just fantastic.  And with Lawson's adept renderings of all the characters and situations, you are left in no doubt that this is one of the best books of this or any other age.<br /><br />So a great wrong has been righted.  I am no longer in the dark regarding \\"Mr. Popper's Penguins\\".  If you'd like to introduce your kids (or, heaven forfend, yourself) to a fantastic piece of penguin rookery, grab yourself a copy of this l'il number.  It's bound to make you a fan.n of this story that you have grabbed one that has Robert Lawson's beautiful illustrations.

I really couldn't tell you why.  I've nothing against Spot, really.  I've nothing for him either, and herein lies the problem.  Spot is a bland \\"Ziggy\\"-like creation.  The books that present him are neither particularly interesting, witty, or sublime to the average adult reader.  Critics would argue that this is precisely the point and that children don't need the same kinds of books as adults.  I remain unconvinced and point out that when there are such marvelous and simple children's books as \\"Olivia\\" or \\"Rosie's Walk\\" or \\"Gossie and Gertie\\" for kids today, why turn around and pick up the fine but dull \\"Where's Spot?\\"?  One has to wonder.<br /><br />In this book, Sally (perhaps the parent of the elusive puppy) is searching for the book's title character.  As she runs around the house the viewer is able to open doors, lift bed curtains, and pry into the cabinets that Sally spies as well.  Behind each, a different animal (or animals) stands there saying, \\"No\\" when asked if Spot is hiding there.  I'll hand this to the creator.  The 1994 edition I was handling held up very very well over the years.  This book has been constructed with tough pages that little one's hands are adept at opening without the rippage usually so common.  The animals are cute and the parents can maybe name them with their kids as they go.  Just the same, don't be surprised if the crocodile under the bed gives a couple squeamish children the creeps for a while.<br /><br />In conclusion...eh.  It's not bad, it's not good, it's not much of anything.  It doesn't teach and if it entertains then that's fine.  If you've a tender place in your heart for the other books in the Spot series, go wild.  This book will certainly live up to expectations.  If, however, your expectations are built on such solid kid-friendly yet really amusing stand-bys as \\"Sesame Street\\" or other witty genres, prepare to be disappointed.  While a fine story, it leaves much to be desired.e story, it leaves much to be desired.	2004-05-17

Now reissued with a whole new illustrator, we members of the United States finally get a chance to read this rather adorable tale.  Though not a cutesy story in and of itself, illustrator Paul Howard has drawn a book that has perhaps set the standard for adorable barn owl tales everywhere.<br /><br />Plop (an unfortuanate name, but whatcha gonna do?) is a small barn owl.  Plop is also afraid of the dark.  Though his parents attempt to inform him that there is nothing to be afraid of, he remains unconvinced.  Finally, they tell him to ask various people and animals for information about the dark.  From a boy the owl learns that the dark is exciting, with fireworks and such.  From an astrologer he learns that the dark is wondrous, allowing us to see the many constellations in the sky.  And so forth.  In the end, Plop is convinced and is able to safely fly in the sky with his mother and father without fear.<br /><br />If you'd like to read something to your little one that doesn't contain much in the way of tension or drama, this book's your ticket.  Though Plop does partake in various escapades, none of these ever become dangerous.  I was particularly interested in a section where he asks a black cat about the night.  Considering that a cat would undoubtedly view a baby barn owl as a yummy snack, I was a bit amazed that nothing bad happened between the two.  Nothing so much as the cat licking his chops or thinking to himself, \\"Boy could I go for a little fowl right now\\".  Nuthin'.  Which is fine.  Illustrator Paul Howard has added pictures drawn with pastel pencils.  The result is that Plop is the fuzziest, cutest, cuddliest little fluffball of an owl to ever flutter across the pages of a picture book.  In addition to being a useful book for children that are afraid of the dark, it is also a good story for convincing children that owls are nothing, in and of themselves, to be afraid of.  Just don't pair this story with Avi's \\"Poppy\\".  All in all, this is a sweet little story with fuzzy-wuzzy pictures.  Cuddly and adorable all at once, it is certain to be a child's favorite as the years go by.to be afraid of.  Just don't pair this story with Avi's \\"Poppy\\".

Maurice Sendak could never have imagined that his canny \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" would not only capture the Caldecott Award of 1963, but go on to be hailed by critics, loved by librarians, and considered by parents to be one of the finest works of picture book art ever concocted.  Is the book deserving of its praise?  I suppose.  But honestly, it is very difficult to read it today without getting caught up in its publicity and hype.  On the whole, though, it is an enjoyable read and few can resist its charms.<br /><br />We begin the book with two small vignettes of the naughty things Max does that get him sent to bed.  Max is a boy outfitted in a wolf suit, and after being sent to his room he finds his boudoire changed completely into a wild forest.  After hopping a nearby boat and traveling, \\"In and out of weeks and almost over a year to where the wild things are\\" he is in a land of monsters.  Taming them by staring them down, the Wild Things make Max their king and celebrate his crowning.  Max proclaims that a wild rumpus should start, and start it does.  When it ends, however, Max decides that he needs to be near someone who loves him.  He leaves his beloved Wild Things, sails back into his room, and goes down to dinner where, on a single white page, we are told, \\"it was still hot\\".<br /><br />Simultaneously combining the wish to be a wild naughty creature uninhibited by love, or rules, or society and at the same time revealing the human need for comfort, the book is a success.  In its illustrations, those wild crazy creatures with their too large eyes and sharp razor-like claws, it is a success.  In its text, the elegantly presented last line or the repetition of wild things saying \\"I'll eat you up\\", it is a success.  Heck, the book is good.  And really, what more is there to say?  Reviewing classics like this one is a pointless job.  I'm not going to be shocking and say that every reviewer since the 1960s is wrong about this book, cause they're not.  They're right, it's great.  Does it deserve the huge publicity and love its garnered?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  But the adults like it and the kids like it, and that is (as they say) enough.  So take it home and love it yourself.  It is a great book.ike this one is a pointless job.

Ahem.  Ms. Virginia Euwer Wolff allow me to thank you for writing such a wonderful book.  I've read many many young adult books in my day, but your book is one of the first to move beyond the text in the millions of ways that it did.  You've penned a book that is as carefully written as it is fantastic.  So, Ms. Euwer, why on earth did you give it the namby-pamby title \\"Make Lemonade\\"?  I've never read a title that made me want to avoid a book more.  Something called \\"Make Lemonade\\" sounds like a more sentimental version of the \\"Chicken Soup for the Soul\\" books.  Your other books, like \\"True Believer\\", have somewhat bland titles, but at least they don't actively scare away the intelligent teens that wouldn't step foot near a book with the overly optimistic title that this one has.  To sum up, great book, hate the title.<br /><br />In \\"Make Lemonade\\" we have a story about self-discovery and self-recovery.  LaVaughn is fourteen years old and is going to go to college someday.  She knows this fact better than she knows anything else.  Of course, that means she needs money, and so she answers an ad for a babysitter.  The woman (if you can call her that) advertising is Jolly, a seventeen year-old single mother of a two year-old and a baby.  As LaVaughn and Jolly get to know one another, the younger girl begins to see clearly the cracks and fissures in Jolly's madcap desperate life.  As the two grow closer LaVaughn has to try to simultaneously help Jolly out while maintaining her own integrity and dealing with the guilt and enabling issues of being her employer's only friend.<br /><br />The book is just as much about the trials of being poor in America today as it is about two girls trying to learn how to create a life of self-sustainability.  LaVaughn isn't exactly from the suburbs herself, so she understands the world Jolly is coming from.  Even so, she has to figure out to what extent she's holding Jolly back from taking the necessary steps to ensure a better life for herself and her kids.  If Jolly's so poor, should LaVaughn give her back all the babysitting money she's earned?  Is LaVaughn helping Jolly live in denial if she's merely offering help?  Is it wrong that LaVaughn is taking the money of a desperate woman so that she herself can go to college and escape the viscious cycle of poverty?  The book moves from practical situations and motions to philosophical ponderings about the nature of existence itself.  Written entirely in free verse in a series of sixty-six poems (of a sort) we learn more about the characters and their lives through this unique medium than we could have ever hoped to with prose.  Wolff is an accomplished writer, her stories capturing the honesty of the hardships that come with poverty.  You won't find any miracles or sudden changes in human behavior in this book unless they come through good hard work.  This book can make you simultaneously love and resent Jolly, just as LaVaughn loves and resents her herself.  For a book that the author says came out of a dirty highchair, this goes on my list as possibly one of the strongest teen books to have ever been written.  Better than \\"Speak\\".  Better than \\"Dinky Hocker Shoots Smack\\".  Better, perhaps, than even \\"The Chocolate War\\".<br /><br />With the exception of its ludicrously optimistic title, this book is without flaw.  A heartwrenching and exceedingly honest tale, it never bores or cheats.  If you want to find an honesty that is at once heart-wrenching and ultimately triumphant, read \\"Make Lemonade\\".  In our day and age, it should be assigned alongside \\"Nickel and Dimed\\" all the live long day.olding Jolly back from taking the necessary steps to ensure a better life for herself and her kids.

Like many of his tales, the remarkable, \\"Dragonwings\\", reflects on the Chinese experience in America.  Says Yep in his author's note, \\"I have tried to make some of these dry historical facts become living experiences\\".  The result is a book that certain kids will grow attached to and respect.  Admittedly, it is not a book for all children, but for what it offers it is an impressive work.<br /><br />The plot follows Moon Shadow, a boy sent from his native China to live with his father in the Land of the Gold Mountains a.k.a San Francisco in 1903.  While there, Moon Shadow learns a great deal about the ways the white settlers (referred to in this text, without exception, as demons) reacted to the Chinese in California.  Yep does not play down the characters' difficulties, but Moon Shadow and his father, Windrider, learn the ways in which they may live their lives acceptably.  They befriend their white employers, survive the great San Francisco earthquake, and finally Windrider follows his dream of making a flying machine just as the Wright Brothers did.  This portion of the book is based on the true story of a Chinese immigrant that on September 22, 1909 flew from the hills of Oakland, California.  As Yep points out in his author's note, this book is a historical fantasy and not an actual factual construction.  Nonetheless, Windrider's quest is such that you feel just as caught up in the excitement of the moment as he is when at last he is able to test his creation.<br /><br />What is so impressive about Lawrence Yep's writing is how he accepts that there are no hard and fast rules about the ways in which people act and react.  The Chinese are constantly set upon by the white majority, yet there are good Tang people and bad Tang people just as there are good whites and bad whites.  The sentence that really drilled this home for me was one referring to a white female friend Moon Shadow and his father made the acquaintance of.  Miss Whitlaw befriends our heroes, as well as the patriarch of their company, referred to mostly as \\"Uncle\\".  The section I love reads, \\"I won't say that Miss Whitlaw and Uncle became the best of friends, but they came to like each other as much as two such difference people could\\".  To me, this is an eloquent description of how two people from remarkably different backgrounds can become close without ever reaching the closeness that comes from being with someone like yourself.<br /><br />So here's the real test of this book; Do kids actually like reading it?  Published originally in 1975, I remember hearing about this story when I was in elementary school.  And, admittedly, I never so much as picked it up.  For those kids that do glance through it, or are assigned it in school, what is their reaction?  Honestly, I thought the book began rather slowly.  Yep is introducing his subject honestly and with tact and feeling, all of which make the beginning a small slog for the average child reader.  Those kids that stick with it, however, will find fights, natural disasters, and attempted throat slittings galore.  To my mind, Yep's \\"Child of the Owl\\" is a lot more kid friendly than the well-written but ultimately measured \\"Dragonwings\\".  So if I were to give a child I knew a good, if more contemporary, book reflecting the experiences of Chinese-Americans, I'd probably offer them the former.  None of this is to say that there aren't children out there that consider \\"Dragonwings\\" to be their favorite book ever.  I just suspect they are a minority.<br /><br />In the end, \\"Dragonwings\\" has won more awards and garnered more praise than I think Lawrence Yep could have ever hoped for.  It is a fine noble creation and well deserves the attention it has received.  Whether kids will ever willingly open its pages is open to debate, but it is definitely a fascinating look into the lives of a people that could well have remainedunknown but for the superb prose and experienced writing of one of the finest American writers of our day and age.for the superb prose and experienced writing of one of the finest American writers of our day and age.	2004-05-13
669428:US	49148452	R3KFL6YP4WJXT8	0060283637	117356664	Patrol: An American Soldier in Vietnam	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Endpapers of camouflage	All at once lush and frightening, Walter Dean Myers has penned a tale that seeks to remind us what war really is.  There are \\"Enemies\\" that are old men and babies.  \\"Enemies\\" that sit beneath trees and contemplate their loved ones.  Never have the lessons of Vietnam been more poignant or needed than they are right now.  In writing this book, Myers has sought to present war beyond gore and gloom, looking instead at the very essence of death itself.  Helped in this attempt by the award winning collage artist Ann Grifalconi \\"Patrol\\" is a frightening story that may hit a little too close to home for some, and not close enough for others.<br /><br />Told in picture book format (a format that I suspect will raise a few eyebrows right there) the story follows one man throughout his day in Vietnam.  The man is frightened.  He knows that his enemy is nearby and wants to hurt him, just as he (on some level) wants to hurt his enemy.  The man's patrol burns down an innocent village that may house members of the enemy.  He calls in bombs and dives into elephant grass for cover.  There, he accidentally runs face to face with the enemy.  \\"In a heartbeat, we have learned too much about each other\\".  Both men escape and the patrolman goes back to base camp to write a letter to a loved one.  He writes, \\"I am so very tired of this war\\".<br /><br />Taken in total, the book is a m&eacute;lange of beauty and fear.  Grifalconi has deftly intertwined illustration and photograph in the pages of this book.  There are extraordinary pictures in which men drawn only with the slightest of pen lines crouch beneath huge overblown tree leaves.  When bombs burst in the distance, planes are both the actual cut-outs of airplanes and the hollows cut out of a misty sky.  The men watching are bathed in the orange light of the distance.  Myers' text is up to the challenge of confronting what war is.  Though the author never goes so far as to condemn the idea of war itself, he finds other ways of showing how ludicrous some wars really are.  When you're as good an author as Walter Dean Myers, all you have to do is write the truth and your message will appear for you.<br /><br />The inside cover of this book proclaims that its age range is 8-12, which is patently ridiculous.  I won't debate if it is appropriate or inappropriate for an eight year-old.  That is left entirely up to the reader (though there is nothing gory or horrific enough to shock a kid of that age).  What I take issue at is the age of 12 designated as the oldest age at which a person would want to read this book.  First of all, this book is perfect for teens and even college age kids and adults in giving a good eye for eye glare at the horrors of being caught in a fighting situation.  Second, this book has a myriad of different uses.  Teachers and librarians are constantly on the look out for picture books that are mature enough for those adults learning to read.  What better purpose could this book have?<br /><br />When Walter Dean Myers joined the army at the age of seventeen, he had to come to grips with Vietnam and the fact that his brother died in combat.  For this author, this book strikes close to home, revealing the stupidity of fighting.  With our nation constantly in combat these days, it takes books like this one to remind us of the dangers of acting as a nation without thought or intelligence.  \\"Patrol\\" gives us many lessons to learn.some wars really are.

670015:US	49148452	R2G3O6N04LOS1N	0689860080	601203914	Dragonsong (Harper Hall Trilogy, Book 1)	Books	5	35	38	N	N	Pern and it's magic dragons	For the child that loves dragons and stories about dragons, only one book series comes to mind that has successfully created an entire complex world of dragons and the people who love them.  Anne McCaffrey's dragonriders of Pern series has existed since the 1970s and it is still as popular as ever.  Author McCaffrey has written intricate imaginings about Pern and its inhabitants.  At once sci-fi and fantasy, she is an adept writer that fully deserves the popularity she has received.  For the child that wants an easy introduction into this world, there are two options.  They could begin at the very beginning of the series and slowly work their way through all the Pern books.  Or, second option, they could start with a book that is both kid-friendly and a wonderful Intro to McCaffrey 101.  \\"Dragonsong\\" was a book that I personally picked up in sixth grade and loved.  It is the perfect way to learn more about the dragons of Pern, their riders, and the people of the planet.<br /><br />McCaffrey is smart.  She knows that this book series is so complex that it there is no way in which to begin any plot without a recap of past events.  She includes in this tale a map of Pern, a useful character list, and a Forward that deftly explains the history of the planet and its dragons.  Then we meet Menolly.  Born in a small fishing village, the girl is the most talented musician in the village, but she yearns to become a professional Harper and create music as well as sing/play it.  Unfortunately, no woman has ever been a Harper before and her conservatively minded family is determined to squash this dream of Menolly's before she shames them in some way.  When life for Menolly becomes too harsh, she escapes into the wide world and takes shelter in a cave.  There, she discovers a cache of fire lizards, small cousins of the dragons that protect Pern.  By witnessing the birth of nine of these pet sized dragons and tending to them, Menolly acquires nine faithful affectionate companions that will help her as she determines how best to live and survive.<br /><br />I don't think I've adequately conveyed the plot as well as I would have liked.  Needless to say, long before Tamora Pierce made her name as the primo Heroines-In-Fantasy genre writer, McCaffrey was writing fantastic stories such as this.  Boys reading this book will undoubtedly enjoy it, but I feel that like myself when young, girls will really gravitate towards the reading.  Menolly is incredibly talented, but smothered and unappreciated by her family members.  The fact that she possesses a brilliance with music and nine tiny dragons makes her special and different and you really want people to turn around and cheer her.  When such a thing finally happens in the book, the reader is awash in joy for the character.  McCaffrey is so adept that reading this book is just a delight.  The only real problem with it comes with an odd backstory about the dragonrider Brekke.  Up until that point, the book has mostly been easy to follow and read. Suddenly Menolly is talking with Brekke's step-daughter and the reader, if they haven't read the previous books in the series, is momentarily confused and bewildered by this plot that's flown in from left field.  Otherwise, the text is perfectly good.<br /><br />If you've a kid who likes fantasy (or heck, an adult for that matter) then you cannot do better than Menolly's series of Pern books, referred to as the Harper's Hall Trilogy by some.

Needless to say, long before Tamora Pierce made her name as the primo Heroines-In-Fantasy genre writer, McCaffrey was writing fantastic stories such as this.  Boys reading this book will undoubtedly enjoy it, but I feel that like myself when young, girls will really gravitate towards the reading.  Menolly is incredibly talented, but smothered and unappreciated by her family members.  The fact that she possesses a brilliance with music and nine tiny dragons makes her special and different and you really want people to turn around and cheer her.  When such a thing finally happens in the book, the reader is awash in joy for the character.  McCaffrey is so adept that reading this book is just a delight.  The only real problem with it comes with an odd backstory about the dragonrider Brekke.  Up until that point, the book has mostly been easy to follow and read. Suddenly Menolly is talking with Brekke's step-daughter and the reader, if they haven't read the previous books in the series, is momentarily confused and bewildered by this plot that's flown in from left field.  Otherwise, the text is perfectly good.<BR> <BR>If you've a kid who likes fantasy (or heck, an adult for that matter) then you cannot do better than Menolly's series of Pern books, referred to as the Harper's Hall Trilogy by some.

Renowned Puerto Rican children?s book author (and, better still, children?s librarian) it is a pleasure to finally read one of her books.  As you may or may not know, the American Library Association distributes the distinguished Pura Belpre award to noteworthy South American children?s books.  As such, it is an honor to finally read one of the author?s best known stories.  The tale of Perez the mouse and Martina the Spanish cockroach.<br /><br />Martina lives all alone in her very own home.  One day she finds a shiny peseta and decides to spend it on a box of powder for her face.  After a good powdering she dresses in her best dress, takes her fan, and sits on her porch.  As she does so, various male members of the community repeatedly come up and ask Martina for her hand in marriage.  This is the part I would have loved as a kid.  I adored stories where characters wanted to wed.  Martina, however, is able to put off each potential suitor by merely asking how he will speak to her one they are married.  Senor Cat would say, ?Miaow, Miaow, Miaow? which would frighten her, Senor Cricket would say, ?Coqui, Coqui, Coqui?, which would make her sad, and so on.  It is only when Perez the mouse, a creature adept at the beautiful bow, asks for Martina?s hand that she agrees.  They have a lovely wedding and Martina performs a fabulous Spanish dance for her Perez.  Then one day while Martina is cooking, Perez falls into the pot and is cooked to death.  The end.<br /><br />Feel the ending is a little abrupt?  So did I.  I?ve a very distinct feeling (though I?ve no facts to back this theory up with) that many a parent in the past has simply ended the book after Martina does her beautiful dance.  I was completely shocked when I reached the picture of Martine staring dumbfounded at her kettle on the fire, Perez?s little well-shod feet sticking straight out of the broth.  It?s such a sad and violent moment that I wondered if I?d idylly wandered into a Grimm fairy tale along the course of my travels.  Just the same, I don?t think the ending is enough to scare children or anything of that nature.  It?ll only depress them.  The last line of the book is, after all, ?And to this time, she still sings, she still plays, and she still weeps for her little Perez to come back to her!?  Sniffle.<br /><br />But I really was very fond of this book.  Carlos Sanchez?s illustrations are both colorful and sprightly.  There?s a beautiful opening shot of Martina sitting on her balcony as Perez croons to her a love ballad beneath a shiny yellow moon.  Sanchez has few problems with making his characters look exactly as they would appear in nature.  Martina may be pink and have a human-like body, but she definitely has the head of a cockroach.  I loved the vibrancy of the pictures as well.  The shot of Martina dancing with maracas in her hands is a lively wonderful piece of fairy tale fare.<br /><br />All in all, if you can get beyond reading a book to your kids about a pair of lovers that ends with one accidentally cooking the other, then I commend you.  It really is a well written story with a superb feel to it.  Just don?t be surprised when you reach the finale.fairy tale along the course of my travels.

I bet they watered it down and made it syrupy.  There's no way this kind of kid's book (in which a father and his four children of different hair colors go hunting for a bear) is going to actually end with the family finding the bear and getting chased back to their house\\".  Well, you can just color me wrong all over.  Not only is the book faithful to the original song, but it's a hoot to boot.  The words are those old familiar ones we all love so well, and the pictures are a high-stepping romp complete with adventure, daring, and danger.  Everything, in fact, that a good picture book could hope to be.<br />If you've ever heard the song \\"We're Going On a Bear Hunt\\" then you know the way the story goes.  A father and his rambunctious youngsters are setting out to locate one bear.  They're not actually on a hunt in terms of carrying guns or anything of that sort.  In fact, these people haven't anything with them but one another and the clothes on their backs.  With their border collie along with they successfully cross the tall wavy grass (swishy swashy), ford the deep cold river (splash splosh), tromp through the ooey-gooey mud (squelch squerch), wander through the deep dark forest (stumble trip!),  run through a whirling snowstorm (Hoooo woooo), and at last enter a deep dark cave (tiptoe).  It's the dog that sees the malicious bear first and the brave troop run back over every place they'd been before to escape.  In a moment of frenzied activity they enter their house only to discover that they've forgotten to shut the door.  At the last minute they get it closed (angry bear safely outside now) and everyone crawls into bed and under the covers.  The final shot in the book is one of the bear as he tromps solemly homeward again.<br />This is quite an exciting book.  Author Michael Rosen has captured the enjoyable sounds of the story quite well, and the high tension towards the end is just delightfully scary enough for the youngsters.  But it is illustrator Helen Oxenbury that really lets this puppy shine.  She has the ability to create scenes in which characters are interacting with one another against huge evocative backgrounds.  I'm very partial to a scene in which the family is joyfully running through the tall grasses, dotted occasionally with deep red poppies.  The sky is a blue one, filled with light puffy clouds and in the distance a flock of birds travels up and away.  Admittedly, I love a good pastoral illustration, but this kind of care for illustrations is visible in all Oxenbury's color pictures (each appearing on every other page).  If you're at all familiar with Helen Oxenbury then you'll find numerous scenes in this story that remind you of her other books.  The baby found here looks like nothing so much as a clothed version of the infant in, \\"Big Mama Makes the World\\".  The muddy squelchy vista in another picture is reminiscent of the barnyard takeover attempt in, \\"Farmer Duck\\".  She knows how to pick `em, Helen Oxenbury does.<br />Will kids be scared by a family chased by a bear?  Pleasantly so, I believe.  The shot of the bear walking home is enough to convince even the worry-wartiest of children that the family is not going to be eaten in the near future.  All in all, this is just another one of those great picture books that fill the world.  It reads aloud very well, so if you need a book to present to a large group, I've found the perfect match for you.  If you like high adventure and a good tale, \\"We're Going on a Bear Hunt\\" delivers both in spades.

671617:US	49148452	R15LU59LOV22VX	0590522485	56775622	The Hickory Chair	Books	3	4	5	N	N	See with your heart	I'll come right out and say it.  I had a very very mixed reaction to this book.  Very indeed.  Partially, this reaction can be blamed on my initial response to, \\"The Hickory Chair\\" when I picked it up.  I thought to myself something along the lines of, \\"oog\\".  Because, you see, I was instantly turned off by the illustrations.  Now I recognized that this was a very unkind thing to feel about a book that, honestly, I hadn't even read.  So I read it through intently.  Then reread it.  And I came to the inescapable conclusion that this was an exceedingly well-written story.  And I also came to the inescapable conclusion that no matter how many times I read it I was not going to be convinced that the illustrations were a good compliment to the text.<br /><br />The story of \\"The Hickory Chair\\" sounds a little bleak when summarized.  In it, a blind boy named Louis is very close to his grandmother.  They've spent good times together playing hide-and-seek, sitting in the attic listening to the wind sing on the roof, and reading by the grandmother's old hickory chair (carved, you see, by a single hickory tree that grew on that very spot so many years ago).  When his grandmother dies, Louis and his family gather to hear her will.  In a final game, they find that their deceased matron left little notes all around the house saying what each person would receive as their legacy.  Louis is exceptionally good at finding everyone's note but his own.  Finally he turns to the hickory chair and searches it, finding a slip of paper just as he knew he would.  Unfortunately the note is only an old shopping list and the family has to face up to the fact that somehow Louis was forgotten.  Later, Louis is given the chair anyway and he decides that the lost note isn't important.  He knows that his grandmother loved him.  It's only years later, when Louis is old and his granddaughter is asleep in that same chair that she discovers, inadvertently in the batting of the cushion, a note that reads, \\"For my favorite youngest grandchild with blind sight\\".  His grandmother's final lost bequest.<br /><br />It's a very touching story, you know.  Author Lisa Row Faustino has penned it well.  Perhaps most wonderful, and extraordinary, is that this book features a boy that is blind without making that plot point THE crux of the story.  Instead, Louis's blindness is just one of those things.  The real focus of this tale is the love shared between Louis and his grandmother, a love that lasted generations.  The bittersweet ending and great evocative characters really make this a great tale.  But then there are the illustrations to contend with.<br />I feel bad about not liking them.  They're very artistic, you know.  According to the bookflap, illustration Benny Andrews has presented his work at the MOMA, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, etc.  He's obviously well regarded in the world of fine art.  But for me, Andrews doesn't translate well to the picture book stage.  There are inconsistencies and abnormalities about this book that bugged me.  For one thing, granny's skin color changes every other page.  The artist has wisely cast the characters in this book as black, and the story works perfectly as a result.  With the possible exception of granny.  The woman on the cover of this book is completely different from the woman handing Louis a flower on the dedication page.  One minute granny's black with grey hair.  The next she's white with black hair.  Then it's back to black but with white hair.  No other character shifts like this in the book, and you kind of have to wonder what the artist was thinking.  People in his pictures in general are a bit expressionless, though this is more the author's technique than any real flaw.  Far more condemning is the illustrator's inability to match his pictures, at times, to the narration.  In a particularly confusing sequence, Louis's mother talks about how when baby Louis was rocked by his grandmother in the hickory chair, he somehow managed to forced his hand into the chair's batting so that when she stood the chair came with her.  It's a little hard to understand just through reading, and well nigh impossible if you look at the picture.  A similar situation takes place at the end with Louis's granddaughter doing the same thing with the batting with her own hand.  The picture however shows her draped over the chair's arm, no hole in sight.  You can argue that these are slight inconveniences in the narration, but I really do feel that they detract from the entire book.  The illustrations do not serve to help the story in any way and I feel that had the artist been trying he could have done a lot better.<br />In the end, loving a book really just boils down to personal preference.  There is not a sliver of doubt in my mind that there are huge Benny Andrews fans out there that will fight to the death to preserve his good name as a children's picture book artist.  Be that as it may, I didn't think he added anything to Lisa Row Fraustino's otherwise very capable and well-written tale.  For me, a better illustrator could have done a far more moving job than the one we see here.  If you'd like to read a touching book about an intergenerational love that can touch you deeply to your core, I really do highly recommend this book.

Bush named as his \\"favorite book\\".  Ignoring the fact that the Mr. Bush was born in 1946 and the book was published originally in 1969, it's a good idea to reexamine \\"The Very Hungry Caterpillar\\" on the basis of its own merits.  It is the best known Eric Carle book by far and has remained a beloved text since the day it was conceived and published.<br /><br />Here's the plot, inasmuch as there is one.  A caterpillar (make that a very HUNGRY caterpillar) proceeds to eat his way through an amazing and amusing assortment of fruits, sweets, and (in time) leaves.  After becoming quite a fat little fellow, the caterpillar makes a cocoon for himself and eventually emerges as a splendiferous butterfly.  The end.<br /><br />I'm going to ignore the fact that as a child I found this book a bit repetitive.  We are told that children like to hear repeated phrases in books, and perhaps this is true.  From what I can recall, however, this book bugged me with its continually repeated, \\"but he was still hungry\\"s.  Looking at it now, though, it is a lovely little work.  The caterpillar has far more expressions on his face than I initially remembered.  When he's searching for food he has a somewhat bewildered look in his eyes.  When he's eaten an amusingly large assortment of foods his eyes droop as he attempts to live through his own stomachache.  Oddly, the time he looks the most distressed is after he has turned into a beautiful butterfly.  Now his face is contorted in such a way that his drooping eyes and open mouth make him look as if he is crooning a sentimental sad ballad to the viewer.<br /><br />To be frank, I'm not the biggest Carle fan in the world.  But he really was one of the forefathers of the collage picture book.  And though I might prefer some of his later book to the caterpillar, there's no denying that the book has had the kind of staying power most authors only dream of.  So by all means pull up a chair and take a gander at the very hungry caterpillar.  It's a nice tale that amuses and entertains even as it helps children to count.dream of.

Long before Harry Potter would have had us believe that boggarts were spirits that took the form of your darkest fears, Susan Cooper had the right idea.  The author of the magnificent and accomplished, \\"The Dark Is Rising\\" series (not to be mistaken with the \\"His Dark Materials\\" series), Cooper set her sights a little younger with this loving free-flowing tale of the ultimate mischevious creature.  Though relying on a couple ideas and motifs that will date this book far more than her better known series ever will, the story is a complete and wonderful accomplishment for an already accomplished artist.<br /><br />The Boggart is an Old Thing, from the days of dark deep magic.  It cannot die and lives only to play pranks and tricks on foolish humans.  For countless centuries this particular Boggart has lived in the Castle Keep on an old abandoned island off the coast of Scotland.  It loves the land and the man who lives in the castle, but when the old owner dies the Boggart is forced to meet the castle's new owners.  That would be Volnik clan, with children Emily and Jessup in tow.  The family is Canadian and it is only through a miscalculation on the Boggart's part that they find themselves shipping the wayward spirit back to Toronto where they live.  After figuring out that their house is now home to the pranks of a Scottish spirit, the kids set about finding a way to send the Boggart back to his castle and his land.<br /><br />Cooper's \\"Dark Is Rising\\" series always suffered a little from too many descriptions and distractions.  Such is not the case here.  In \\"The Boggart\\" we get to know an array of different characters exceedingly well.  The children are interesting and lively without ever disintegrating into brattiness.  The parents are delightfully eccentric while remaining loving and concerned.  Sixteen year-old Barry (who hangs out with ten year-olds) is a bit odd, so while you feel for him you don't necessarily blame Emily and Jessup's suspicious mom.  As for the Boggart itself, it encompasses everything that is wild and untamed.  The Boggart is the \\"other\\", and that otherness is felt in its sublime British nature.  I should note that though Cooper is English by birth, she captures perfectly the feeling Americans and Canadians have on visiting the British Isles.  One would almost think she was from our side of the ocean, the way she accurately describes a Yank's reactions to the natural beauty and wonder of the Scottish land.<br /><br />The only flaw in the book as I see it is the use of computers.  Bearing in mind that this story was published in 1993, one has to expect some problems with the plot.  Therefore, hearing that a boy's new computer has a black and white screen, or the very description of its computer programs themselves, it's hard not to see that this book is rather out-of-date.  Then again, given a little time this book may merely appear to be a piece of historical fiction.  No harm there.  The book does pull a kind of \\"Independence Day\\" scheme where two computers, one in Canada and one in Scotland, apparently are the same make and model and can switch files and games without the book ever saying as much.  But these are tiny concerns, honestly.<br /><br />If you're looking for a tale that incorporates the ancient mystery of the Celts, dark abandoned castles, and a michevious sprite, this is an ideal story.  It is a fantasy for those kids that have grown tired of dragons for a little while.  And its myriad of different settings (a castle, a home, a theater, an antique shop) are a blast to visit.

Jean Fritz is perhaps best known for her short picture book biographies of Revolutionary War Heroes.  I was anxious to read this particular book, and to my great surprise found it to be much longe than her usual fare.  Just the same, the book carries the same spirit and adept interesting writing Fritz has employed on her other ventures.  I had some disappointments with this book, it's true, but all in all I think it's a fine biography and the best one out there for any kid interested (or required) in reading about our odd twenty-sixth President.<br />We begin with a small sickly boy.  Young Teddy (a name he accepted but disliked) was asthmatic and, as a result, of poor constitution.  Pressed by his adored father to make something of himself, Ted set about exercising and pushing himself so as to become strong and tough.  This man was truly an embodiment of all that was masculine.  As he grew he was continually obsessed with nature, and it was assumed that he would someday go into the field of naturalism.  As it happened, Teddy got waylaid and after taking some law went into politics.  What was to follow was a madcap series of election losses, faithful Republican supporters, and, in time, a war.<br />Now it is around the time that Fritz starts describing Teddy's involvement in the Spanish-American War that she loses me.  What separates Fritz from James Giblin or Russell Freedman (two excellent historical biographers for children in their own right) is that she refuses to blame Teddy for anything.  As a writer she obviously admires her subject, and you can see why.  There was much to admire about the man.  At the same time, however, this was a fairly war-hungry fella.  Unlike Giblin, who has written such wonderful biographies as \\"Charles Lindbergh: A Human Hero\\", Fritz doesn't show the problems that came with Teddy's choices.  There is little doubt to my mind that Teddy saw the Spanish-American War as a \\"just\\" war.  There is also little doubt that it most certainly was NOT a just war.  Even when it becomes clear that the American public was misled in its thinking that war was the only answer (\\"Remember the Maine\\" anyone?) and that Teddy was a part of that misinformation, Fritz ignores such controversial topics.  And what of the muckrakers?  Where's Teddy's famous dismissal of hard-hitting journalism?  Too much is left unsaid or avoided in this book to allow it to be considered one of the great children's biographies out there.  Additionally, one does have to take issue with Fritz's portrayal of the Native Americans.  As a previous reviewer has pointed out, Fritz's facts (though she includes a lovely bibliography of sources) seem sketchy.<br />Which isn't to say there isn't a lot to love here.  There are Fritz's thrilling tales of Mr. Roosevelt's life.  As an author, she has packed a great deal of info into this book.  Everything from ponies in the White House to the origin of the teddy bear is included here.  Accompanying Fritz's narration are some great illustrations by Mike Wimmer.  My objection to them might be that even when we are viewing a young 20-some year-old Teddy, the illustrations are clearly of an older man.  How hard would it have been to erase the waddle on the twenty-three year old Ted?  Even shots of our protagonist as a boy show him with his head almost completely turned away from the viewer.  It would have been nice if Mr. Wimmer had had a little more confidence in his own artistic abilities.<br />On the whole, it's a nice book.  I know I've talked it down and pointed out its inconsistencies, but in spite of my own personal feeling, Teddy Roosevelt is a subject well worthy of a biography.  This, after all, was the pro-environment president.  The president who fought against huge corporations and went head-to-head with J.P. Morgan.  The times in which we live today could use another Theodore R.  When big business is just as large as ever and the national parks Teddy created are threatened by drilling, we shouldlook back at heroes like the one found in this book and remember that sometimes a single man can accomplish a lot in his day.d look back at heroes like the one found in this book and remember that sometimes a single man can accomplish a lot in his day.	2004-05-11

Together, these two have successfully rendered the world of nursery-dom topsy turvey, beginning with the clever, \\"The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs!\\".  At long last, the viewer has a chance to look past the biased press and (undoubtedly) stacked juries to hear the true story from the lips of Mr. Alexander T. Wolf himself.<br />As Wolf puts it, the whole thing was just a big misunderstanding.  One of those events that get blown way out of proportion.  See, it's like this... the wolf was just looking to borrow a cup of sugar for his poor bed-ridden granny.  He wanted to make a cake for her, but finding himself lacking the necessary ingredients he went to his nearest neighbor to borrow some.  Now here's where it all went higgledy-piggledy.  The pig (living in a straw home) didn't answer the door and the wolf had a bad cold.  By pure bad luck he accidentally sneezed the home down and, in effect, killed the pig.  Thinking it a bad idea to waste pork, the wolf ate the pig and decided to try another neighbor.  And so it went until he got to the brick house and was shortly, thereafter, arrested.  Poor poor wolfie.<br />Here's what you have to contend with if you read this book to l'il uns.  Yes, you have a wolf eating pigs.  Which is, to be fair, what wolves do.  Now you never see the wolf actually put each pig in his mouth.  And you never see the pig's faces prior to their devourement.  So, frankly, how much worse is this than your average fairy tale?  Trust me, the kids'll get over it.  After all, the book is aligned in such a way that your sympathies really do side with the wolf himself.  I was especially amused by the book's take on the \\"biased\\" media.  Says the wolf, the truth was kind of dull, \\"So they jazzed up the story with all of that `Huff and puff and blow your house down.' And they made me the Big Bad Wolf\\".<br />Aside from the great story, Lane Smith really did a nice job with the illustrations on this one.  Tiny details spot every scene.  Notice, if you will, the brick car parked next to the third pig's brick house.  Notice that all the reporters are pigs (as is the jailor at the end).  Best of all, check out the wolf's portrait of his grandmother looking suspiciously like another wolf of classic lore.<br /><br />It's a great book and an amusing (if somewhat overdone these days) story.  Like a good ironic twisty tale?  Enjoy seeing a fairy tale creature protesting the media?  Dislike pigs?  Then pull a chair up and take a gander at that wonderful 1989 concoction, \\"The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs!\\".

Come on, everybody!  Say it along with me... Tikki Tikki Tembo-No Sa Rembo-Chari Bari Ruchi-Pip Peri Pembo.  Whew!  It's a mouthful, which is of course the point.  In this book (originally published, I kid you not, in 1968) we learn about the dangers of over-monikering one's own offspring.<br />Two boys live with their mother near an old well.  The eldest is considered the more important of the two, and his is the extraordinarily long name.  His younger brother is named Chang.  Chang and Tikki love one another, and when Chang falls into the well his brother rushes off to save him.  Tikki fetches the old man with the ladder, who rescues the sodden boy.  Later (not the same day, thankfully) the boys play around the well again and this time it's Tikki who has fallen in.  When Chang attempts to tell his mother what has happened, it's all he can do to spout out that enormous mouthful of a name.  When his mother finally understands, he too is sent to the old man with the ladder and a very similar scene occurs.  In the end Tikki is rescued, though his prolonged well-exposure leaves him sick for a little while.  Hence (according to this tale and, yes yes, not historically accurate in the least), \\"the Chinese have always thought it wise to give all their children little, short names instead of great long names\\".<br />When I was read this book as a kid I remember disliking small sections of it (whilst enjoying the entire thing as a whole).  I felt bad for Chang, a boy whose name translated roughly to \\"little or nothing\\".  Yet Chang and Tikki don't engage in any sibling rivalry or bad feelings.  They play together as happily as can be.  And though their mother does refer to Tikki with such names as \\"my first and honored son, heir of all I possess\\", the final shot of the book is Chang seated snugly on his mother's lap as they speak with the bed-ridden Tikki.  So is the book racist?  I dunno.  Not to my eyes, though I've already admitted that having been read this book while a child, I'm biased towards it.  I really don't think there's anything in here to seriously offend someone, unless becoming offended is their goal.  Yes, we can all agree that the clothing is Japanese while the characters are Chinese.  Confusing, certainly.  And the last line in the story is a bit odd, but personally I don't feel it will turn your children into raving-mad racists.  It's just an amusing story told with a great deal of zip and verve.  Author Arlene Mosel has told it in such a way that the reader really enjoys repeated passages that say things like, \\"He pumped the water out of him and pushed the air into him, and pumped the water out of him and pushed the air into him\\".  Blair Lent's illustrations are just as amusing and fun.  Though a book of limited colors, it almost seems to the reader as if there are millions of subtle variations on the blues and greens shown throughout the story.<br />The fact of the matter is, this is just a great book.  Top drawer.  If you've an ability to tell a tale well, then it is a crime and shame that you are not reading this book to a little one right now.  For as long as children enjoy hearing rhymes and syncopated rhythms, this book will remain a popular item.nugly on his mother's lap as they speak with the bed-ridden Tikki.  So is the book racist?

It's just a pleasant pleasant story to read through.  Based on a classic Chinese folktale, the book follows an old married couple and their life.  The two live in utter simplicity, only eating the food from their garden and occasionally selling the surplus when they get the chance.  One day the old man, Mr. Haktak, is digging in the garden when he finds an old pot.  He brings it home to his wife (after a fair amount of struggling and straining) and it isn't long before the two discover that the pot is magic.  Indeed, after Mr. Haktak's purse and Mrs. Haktak's hairpins fall in and wondrously duplicate the two come to the rather obvious conclusion that the pot doubles anything that falls into it.  They're right of course, and the pot truly seems as if it is too good to be true.  Unfortunately, the day Mrs. Haktak accidentally falls into the pot herself, things become a little more complicated for the two...three...four people.<br /><br />The book is utterly charming.  Filled with author/illustrator Lily Toy Hong's roly poly people, the humor of each and every situation is undeniable.  There's a great moment when Mr. Haktak is pulling his wife from the pot, only to find another pair of legs are kicking in her place.  The book also has (if this makes any sense) a rather contemporary feel to it.  Though it may well be an ancient story, the way in which Ms. Hong has written it makes it feel as fresh and lively as the day it was conceived.  There are wonderful little details in some of the more crowded scenes and each illustration is drawn with thick pleasant colorful lines that are enticing to the eye.  Should you be looking for a good Chinese folktale to entertain the little ones with, and you'd rather not read anything too old or possibly racist, then this book is a perfect fit.  Simultaneously elegant and easy to understand, it's sure to be beloved by the whole fam.	2004-05-11

To assail with contemptuous cries or other expressions of disapproval or contempt.<br />(This definition has been brought to you courtesy of \\"Webster's Third New International Dictionary\\").<br />A clever title for a book that is, in and of itself, pretty darn smart.  Penned by a man better known for his adult detective tales, \\"Hoot\\" garnered a fair amount of praise when it was first published.  It did win the 2003 Newbery Honor Award, after all.  No small feat with the sheer amount of well-written children's literature out there.  The book is deceptively simple, excellently written, and a great addition to the canon of kids-taking-on-corporate-monoliths-with-grassroots-intervention genre.<br />Roy has just moved to Florida from Montana, and he hates it.  No wonder too.  In Montana he had mountains, and cowboys, and fresh cool seasons.  In Florida he has flat flat landscapes, a bully that wants to squash Roy in a variety of different shapes, and detestable summery sticky seasons.  Things start looking up, however, when Roy spots a barefooted boy running at top speed away from the school bus on a weekday.  Sensing a mystery to the boy, Roy gets involved in a plot involving the local burrowing owl population.  It seems as if a huge chain entitled Mother Paula's All-American Pancake Houses, Inc. has decided to build its next yummy store smack dab on top of the owls and their homes.  Joining with the barefoot boy (nicknamed Mullet Fingers) and the boy's soccer playing tough-girl step-sister Beatrice, the three work to put an end to the dastardly plot to bury the burrowers.<br />I'm coming at this book from a number of different levels.  To begin with, it does my aging (albeit 26-year-old) hippy heart glad to see a book in which grassroots organization ultimately topples large competitors like Mother Paula's.  What really is impressive is one of the many morals of the story.  Roy is told by his parents to balance the wishes of his heart with his head.  Obviously he cares for these tiny owls and their homes, but engaging in vandalism like Mullet Fingers (harmless vandalism, yes, but illegal just the same) isn't going to solve anything.  What Roy has to do, ultimately, is to go the relatively boring route.  Get the facts on paper.  In the end, the solution to the problem is as much legal as it is moral.  Hiassen does take the easy route out by having the owl be an endangered species.  I would have personally enjoyed the story more if this was just a tale about a couple kids trying to save perfectly normal and common burrowing owls, but oh well.  It's a tiny complaint.  On another level, how many books do your read these days where a) The main character has caring parents b) The main character has caring parents that are intelligent and c) The main character has caring parents that are intelligent AND to whom the main character reveals everything when asked.  When Roy's dad asks him to explain himself, he does.  This is such a rarity in children's literature on a whole (usually because it's easier to write disobeying children than obeying ones) that it deserves to be commended.  So well done, Mr. Author-sir.  Well done indeed.<br />The characters are particularly well drawn as well.  Hats off to Carl Hiaasen for his excellent depictions of women-folk.  Beatrice Leep is a soccer jock, blond, and wears glasses.  Ooh!  Quick quick, who can spot the character that doesn't rely on ancient stereotypes?  I can I can!  Beatrice ain't no one you've met before, honey.  She has a horrible family life, a step-brother she must protect at all costs, and sharp pointy teeth.  I was particularly taken with the moment in which Beatrice decides to knaw her mother's toe ring off her nasty stepmother's foot.  Rounding out the unusual characters is an officer that's simulataneously a lummox and redeemable, a foreman that's a boor but amusing, and a bully that never really tries to becomea good guy in any way, shape, or form.<br />I could go on and on, but Amazon.com limits reviews to 1000 words, so I'll just stop here.  The point I am making is that this book isn't just moral and isn't just well-written, but is also (most importantly) fun.  It's amusing to read.  You just want to zip through it when you start your perusal.  If Hiaasen isn't satisfied with merely snatching the Newbery Honor, then I personally would like to request that he strive for the top honor again.  Write another book, Mr. Hiaasen!  If it's even half as good as this one, you can rest assured that I'll be reading it soon.ecome a good guy in any way, shape, or form.  <br />I could go on and on, but Amazon.com limits reviews to 1000 words, so I'll just stop here.

It's 1968.  America is unofficially (according to all \\"reputable\\" sources) at war in Vietnam.  It's the sixties.  People are experimenting with drugs and the whole psychedelic scene.  Enter the Caldecott Award winning, \\"Drummer Hoff\\".  To the person who was writing the book jacket flap, this story, \\"will inspire a smart salute and a march about the room\\".  To anyone who reads this book today, however, this is quintessential anti-war propaganda.  And it's a marvelous read.<br />Throughout this tale, Drummer Hoff (who fired it off) and his fellow bespangled soldiers, officers, corporals, etc. construct, before our eyes, a canon.  As the verses continue we see each member of the company adding his own touch to the proceedings.  For example, Corporal Farrell brings the barrel.  Major Scott brings the shot.  You get the idea.  This all culminates with General Border who, in the end, gives the order and Drummer Hoff (finally abandoning his baton) fires it off.  Suddenly the world is engulfed in blood red smoke, Hoff knocked slightly to one side, the extravagantly illustrated word, \\"KAHBAHBLOOOM\\" appearing.  In our final scene the canon sits there, abandoned by the men.  Baby birds grow in its mouth.  The name of the canon (Sultan) has been buried and we now only see a smiling sun on its side.  Grasshoppers frolic, a spider spins its web, and flowers are everywhere.  Make of it what you will<br />So let's look at it again.  The words are very much like an old English series of verses.  They could be 40 years old or 400.  Now look at the illustrations.  I think I'm truthful in saying that I have never read a children's book that looked like this.  From the odd thick black lines that permeate every tiny detail of each page to the delicate trussing up of each member of the army, this book is fabulous.  I just stare at the double page spread of the canon firing and I'm agog.  It may not be drug induced, but this book certainly had something to say about its copyright date.  Honestly, you've never seen a story like this before.<br />Today we are living in a time when violence and war seem as normal as bacon and ham.  With the world around us as dangerous as it is, the time has never been better to pull out our older copies of \\"Drummer Hoff\\" so as to take another gander.  Read it through carefully.  Appreciate the beauty of its lines and pictures.  Then turn to that last page and just ponder it for a while.  The book deserves that much, at least.had something to say about its copyright date.

Instead, this book examines a girl and her inability to face up to the harsh realities of her life.  A 1967 Caldecott winner, \\"Sam, Bangs, and Moonshine\\" follows Samantha (commonly known as Sam), her cat Bangs, and her extraordinary imaginings that inevitably lead to a heap of trouble.  A tale that is simultaneously quiet and riveting, the multitalented Evaline Ness wrote a book that examines, in a roundabout way, how the death of a parent can change a child's very perceptions.<br />Sam and Bangs live in a fishing community, where her father works with the other men at sea.  Prone to telling tale of gross exaggeration, Sam is warned repeatedly by her father not to tell \\"moonshine\\" (as he refers to her tales and stories).  One day, Sam's father encourages her to go a whole day without indulging in moonshine, and then he's off.  While gone, Sam's younger friend Thomas arrives to inquire after her supposed pet of a baby kangaroo.  Every day Thomas asks to see the pet, and every day Sam tells him that it just left and where Thomas can go to find it.  On this particular day Sam sends the boy to a \\"cave behind Blue Rock\\".  As Thomas leaves Bangs remarks (as the wise old cat was wont to do) that the tide rises early at Blue Rock that day.  Sam doesn't wish to have anything to do with the matter so Bangs goes himself to find Thomas.  When the rain begins to fall heavily and neither Thomas nor Bangs return, Sam gets a rude awakening as to the extent to which moonshine can harm the ones she loves.<br />The book ends happily, I assure you, but there are some harrowing moments.  The scene in which Sam sobs against her father's chair, her dad sitting with his back to her and his face sorrowful and long, is heartwrenching.  I really did feel that the book was a cut above the other picture books out there on a variety of different levels.  The story is exceedingly well written.  In the climax of Sam's self-discovery, she sits in bed pondering (at her father's suggestion) the difference between real and moonshine.  \\"Moonshine was a mermaid-mother, a fierce lion, a chariot drawn by dragons, and certainly a baby kangaroo...Real was no mother at all.  Real was her father and Bangs.  And now there wasn't even Bangs\\".  Here we get a glimpse into what makes Sam tick.  Her mother died long ago, leaving her little daughter to pretend that it was not so.  What child could easily face her mother's death at such a young age?  Sam is undoubtedly not the first child to pretend such glorious things when she is blue.<br />Ness's story is remarkable, but her illustrations are really what gave this book the attention it deserved.  Ness was a commercial artist at one time, and her pictures are an amazing mixture of print, pen and ink, and a four-color pallet of blue, maroon, navy, and mustard.  She is simultaneously realistic and fantastical.  Also, she has drawn the most lifelike cat I've seen in a book in a long long time.  Bangs is spot on.  I can only assume that Ness used a real cat as a model, so well done is the feline.<br />Altogether \\"Sam, Bangs, and Moonshine\\" is a beautifully laid out piece of, to my mind, relative obscure material.  Only its Caldecott Medal status has kept it in the public eye for as long as it has.  This is a bit of a shame when you consider how great the book is when discovered.  Should you happen to have a child that is prone to extravagant imaginings and lurid tales, this may be the book for them.  Should you happen to have a child that lost a parent at a young age, this may be the book for them.  And should you happen to have a child period, this may be the book for them.  It's an excellently written picture book that fully deserves both its credit and its praise.of Sam's self-discovery, she sits in bed pondering (at her father's suggestion) the difference between real and moonshine.  \\"Moonshine was a mermaid-mother, a fierce lion, a chariot drawn by dragons, and certainly a baby kangaroo...Real was no mother at all.

This isn't one of those books that you quickly glance through then immediately write your response on.  It's that rare kind of book that you read, and stop, and then think about for long periods of time.  It's the book you carry with you to quiet places, like park benches or sloping green hills, just to read it to yourself.  It's a book that sings without straining, that ropes you in with its words and then traps you with its images.  I shouldn't be writing this review now.  I should stop and think more about this book, ponder it a while, and when I figure out what to make of it THEN I'd write this review.  But I'm afraid that if I wait to puzzle this book through completely, I'll never get around to writing anything at all.  And that would be the worst response to something this good, I suppose.  So it is with great reluctance that I'm going to try to convey to you what this book feels like to read.<br />A little background first.  Written by young adult book god Walter Dean Myers, the author switches his focus from long prose to picture book form.  Accompanied by Christopher Myers (an artist in the sense that what he draws drips into you) the two have concentrated on the blues.  There's a fabulous author's note at the beginning explaining what the blues is and how it was born.  From the call and response singing form, found on the continent of Africa, this type of music mixed with European English to create the final product, the blues.  Myers puts it this way, \\"When art from two cultures comes together, the result is often an exciting new experience\\".  He goes on to explain a couple terms and how the blues moved from the fields to the cities.  Then the book begins.<br />I don't know enough about the blues personally to be able to tell if all the different lyrics found in this book can be individually assigned to a particular singer or situation, though I assume that this is the case.  Likewise, I'm not certain if the illustrations in this book are based on photographs, but again, I assume so.  After all, I recognized the reference to \\"strange fruit\\" one one page, and on another I remembered seeing the photo of the two boys sitting on the street curb, one turning his head away to sob. The book does something near impossible.  It conveys misery without depressing.  Reading through these stanzas, it's almost as if the book is one multi-veined blues song itself.  The illustrations compliment this perfectly.  The book is black and blue, brown and white.  But mostly blue, to be honest.  My favorite two-page spread features women hanging their sheets to dry on one page, and a woman reaching towards a flying blackbird on another.  I could sit and stare at these pages for hours, if I had a mind to.<br />The books ends with a timeline of significant moments in the blues as well as a glossary of terms.  Y'know, there are hundreds of books out there today about jazz and the importance of the jazz musicians.  Why have the blues been so ignored?  I can only assume because jazz is the easier subject to write about.  Writing about blues, you're in danger of only showing the depressing aspects of the genre, and not the art.  It takes an artist to convey this particular form well.  We are fortunate that not one, but two artists took it upon themselves to do just that.

I decided to check out the infamous \\"Nappy Hair\\", once considered so damaging by so few (and yet so vocal).  So I flipped through it.  Then I read it once.  Then I read it twice.  Then I tried turning it upside down and reading it from back to front because I just couldn't see how anyone could raise a ruckus over such a great little old story.  The fact of the matter is, ladies and gentlemen, that this is a great book.  A fun to read tale of accepting one's own self despite physical aspects that some members of society might not approve of.  In short, having nappy hair.<br /><br />Now the book opens with the family's Uncle Mordecai telling a tale.  The whole book is, in fact, in Uncle Mordecai's voice and as he speaks about little Brenda, her nappyness, and the nature of African American hair itself, his family is getting ready to sit down to a summer picnic of hot dogs, side dishes, and pie.  In his story, Mordecai talks about the very essence of Brenda's hair.  How hard it is to untangle, the sound it makes when you try, and who Brenda is herself.  He then suddenly lauches headlong (despite the repeated groans and moans of his extended family) into telling how God himself proclaimed this hair to be as it is.  We do not, for the record, see God.  We just hear Him as He states that this child will have at least eight complete circles in her hair per inch (a line that I love).  As a result, here is a girl that avoids the straighteners, the relaxers, and the processes that would render her hair flat and dull.  The book even goes so far as to explain about Africa and how this hair came straight over the slave ships and, \\"wouldn't stop for nothing\\".  And then here we have her.  A girl that can dance, \\"right on through all the wimp hair\\".  She's proud of her hair of her head and her life.  The final parting shot sees her standing with all her family, smiling at the viewer, perfectly content with who she is and what she has.<br /><br />Now I haven't a clue how one goes about reading this book to groups and for a very simple reason.  The book is written as a kind of call and response.  Uncle Mordecai will make a statement like, \\"And I'm gonna tell y'all how she came up with all this nappy hair\\", and the various relatives will reply, \\"Brother, will you stop\\".  The entire book is like this.  A line or two by Mordecai, then a reply that's sometimes short and sometimes a little longer.  How do you read that?  Some people might have relatively little problem with the words and the stanzas.  Others would definitely struggle.  Should you intend to read this book for your child, sit down and go through it a couple times first.  Get a feeling for the ebb and flow of the language because until you feel comfortable with what you're reading, you're not going to be able to convincingly persuade your child that this beautiful style is worth their listening.<br /><br />Complimenting Carolivia Herron's words are Joe Cepeda's illustrations.  The book is full of interesting details and delicate touches.  Notice, if you will, that the angels that argue with the Lord that the child should not have nappy hair are, in fact, members of the girl's family.  Take some time to observe how well Cepeda draws the single strand of Brenda's hair.  Or, my personal favorite, the image of a girl with nappy hair sitting in Africa staring at the shocking orange sky.  As she sits she is bedecked in a glorious green woven cloth, her neck, wrists, and ankles decorated.  It's a moment of reflection, for both the character and the reader.  It is also, in many ways, the quintessential climax of the tale.<br />So as you can see, this is a rare rare book.  You won't find many like it in your schools, libraries, and bookstores.  It's difficult to write a story about being proud about something that society, as a whole, may sniff at.  I think Herron and Cepeda did the best that they could and that no humanbeing could have said what they said better.  \\"Nappy Hair\\" is a beautiful success story of a book.ld have said what they said better.  \\"Nappy Hair\\" is a beautiful success story of a book.	2004-05-07

With its distinctly metropolitan tone and feeling, this book is undoubtedly takes place in New York.  Yet as I was reading it I kept feeling that I was looking at something distinctly British.  There is, after all, a simplicity to the British picture book that most American tales don't contain.  And then there's, \\"What James Likes Best\\".<br />A quiet collection of toddler vignettes, the book examines several activites that small James partakes in, and then asks the readers' opinion as to which of those activities James liked the most.  For example, in one such story James visits his Aunt and Grandma.  He plays with a purple car, eats cheese from a tiny fork, and goes for a ride in a taxi.  So which of these does James like best (or was it Auntie's hair that caught his little heart)?  The words in this story are very simple and very straightforward.  They feel perfectly composed and ideally written so as to convey the plot of this little book.  The illustrations are also rather simple, but they go above and beyond James' storyline.  Many of these pictures show James having fun, while in the background the grown-ups are given a chance to mix and intermingle with one another.  I enjoyed watching the father of James squeeze himself into a tiny zoo train car or patiently carry home a potroast from a visit with the relatives.<br />Books that speak to children clearly and effectively and yet can be read multiple times by adults are worthwhile reading.  Should you so feel inclined, I highly recommend you pick up a copy of \\"What James Likes Best\\" for your own perusal.  A fine flavorful tale.	2004-05-07

These books, on the whole tend to be written with the older child reader in mind.  Swiveling her head a full 90 degrees to the left, Lowry has now decided to write a book with the younger child readers in mind.  Hence, the creation and subsequent publication of the adorable, \\"Gooney Bird Greene\\".  Tis a tale of one girl, her stories, and her awe-stricken/hand-raising/wide-eyed classmates.<br />When Gooney Bird Greene arrives in Mrs. Pidgeon's second grade class unannounced, nobody knows quite what to make of her.  Decked out in pajamas and cowboy boots, and holding her lunch with a dictionary, she immediately becomes the class's star pupil.  For you see, Gooney Bird Greene was blessed with the gift of storytelling.  By sheer coincidence, Mrs. Pidgeon is attempting to teach the class all about the different parts of a story.  As the book progresses and Gooney Bird tells her \\"absolutely true\\" tales, the book carefully examines what it is that makes a story either good or bad.  By the end, Gooney Bird has influenced all the students (and even Mrs. Pidgeon) to tell their own stories just as she has.<br />The book's top notch, really.  Both children and their parents reading this book will be entranced by the notion of how Gooney Bird's outrageously titled tales really do turn out to be true in the end. The tale entitled, \\"How Gooney Bird Came from China on a Flying Carpet\\" turns out to be about how Gooney Bird and her family moved from their small town of China in their car, and how GB accidentally flew out of the car while in the center of the family's old rolled up carpet.  The tale, \\"Why Gooney Bird Was Late for School Because She Was Directing a Symphony Orchestra\\" is about how she directed a bus full of musicians to the local town hall where they were to play.  You get the idea.  The only tale GB tells that strains at its wording is, \\"Beloved Catman Is Consumed by a Cow\\", though you'll have to read it yourself to see if you agree with me or not.<br />When I first read the description of this book, I was greatly afraid that this would be a younger person's version of Jerry Spinelli's \\"Stargirl\\".  I thought (and was completely wrong) that the book was about a girl who's completely different from her classmates, they they all initially love her but then eventually despise her, and that she would befriend the trouble making kid and the shy and quiet kid in the course of her adventures.  Wrong.  Wrongdy wrong wrong.  This book is, in fact, about a girl and the great awe inspiring talent of spinning a good yarn.  Accompanying Ms. Lowry's adept words and motifs are the illustrations of Middy Thomas.  These help to drill home the fact to kids of how very cool Gooney Bird really is.  I highly recommend, by the way, that all you adults out there read the back inner flap of the book for the author/illustrator description.  It's very amusing.<br />How rare to read a book that is intended for such a young audience but is still so well written.  If you've a child that tells stories all the time and is the right age for this book (it's an early chapter book, so you can decide how well it fits them yourself) then I highly recommend that you go out and get this item immediately.  Similarly, if you've any interest in all in teaching the kiddies about the parts and features of a good story, go and get yourself some \\"Gooney Bird Greene\\".

Warning: By reading this book to your children you may be inadvertently encouraging them to force-feed their puppies alphabet soup.  Creating a book that is as much comic strip as it is enjoyable picture book, Susan Meddaugh's enjoyable 1992 creation follows the adventures and misadventures of Martha the talking pup.  After being fed a bowl of delicious alphabet soup, Martha, the family pet, begins talking in complete grammatically correct sentences.  For the family, this new occurrence is initially a boon.  Martha is able to explain all kinds of doggish mysteries, hitherto unexplained to humans.  She answers the door to the pizza delivery girl, much to family's amusement.  She amazes both family and friends.  Unfortunately, there are downsides to owning a talking dog.  Martha, once she learns how to dial the phone, is prone to ordering large quantities of barbecue beef.  She doesn't understand such social niceties as not commenting on someone's appearance loudly in pubic (especially if that someone is fat).  And she talks constantly about nothing at all.  When the family finally proclaims that Martha's talking is too much, the humbled doggie falls into a deep depression and refuses to devour anymore alphabet soup.  Fortunately the appearance of a nasty burglar in the home gives Martha the opportunity to save the day and reinstate herself as the family's favorite talking dog.<br />The book's an original, no question.  Martha's constant chatter appears as speech balloons over her head.  If you get this edition in hardback, I highly recommend that you flip to the author's photo on the back inside cover to see a picture of a dog that looks very much as if it might have been the inspiration for Martha's cuddly form.  The illustrations are sweet and inticing and Martha says everything you'd expect a dog to say (if neutered).  The double page spread of her blowing away the family with an incredibly long speech is particularly impressive.  I suspect that if you were to read this book to your little one they would insist that you read every single word that pops out of Martha's mouth.  All things considered, this might take some time so prepare to set aside some 20 minutes for a full and unabridged reading of the delightful \\"Martha Speaks\\".  As for the use of the term, \\"shut up\\", (which the family yells at Martha when they canst takes it no more) this is left entirely up to the reader's discretion.  If you live in a home where the phrase is considered impolite, you may wish to read it aloud from the book in a silly way, or simply disguise it as the less controversial \\"Be Quiet\\" (which I do not, personally, endorse).  If this phrase is not considered impolite in your home, let rip and let go.<br />This is altogether a fine book and an amusing story.  This is an excellent choice for those children interested in the intricacies of canine yabbering.d this book to your little one they would insist that you read every single word that pops out of Martha's mouth.

I had been under the impression (an impression I now see was thankfully false) that \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" had fallen into relative obscurity in the last 20 years or so.  I'm basing this impression on the fact that you just don't hear anybody mention it anymore.  Not librarians or booksellers or teachers or anybody.  You don't read current criticism of the book.  There aren't huge theses based on its plot or reasonings.  And yet...  It is a great story with great writing, a lovely (if sometimes overdone) plot, and a merry cast of characters.  Accompanied by the delicate illustrations of one Jules Feiffer, the book deserves to be remembered for all time.  Hopefully, it will be.<br />We follow the adventures of Milo in this story.  Milo is ennui incarnate.  Nothing interests the boy and he has a very difficult time seeing the point in anything at all.  One day Milo walks into his room with the plan of finding disinterest there and finds instead that he has been given a large present.  It is, according to an accompanying note, one genuine turnpike toolbooth.  After assembling the creation, Milo decides to play with it for a little while.  He hops into his electric car (possibly the number one toy most desired by children reading this tale), plops some money into the toolbooth, and finds himself in a completely different, and oddly unnamed, new land.  It is there that Milo meets and befriends a variety of different creatures and beings.  Ultimately, the boy is sent on a journey to locate the princesses Rhyme and Reason from their imprisonment in the sky.<br />But the brunt of the book, and the parts that most people remember, are the warlike words between the king of Dictionopolis and the Wizard of Digitopolis.  In fact, all that I could remember about this book (years after reading it and moments before rereading it) was that the debate was the question of which was more important; words or numbers?  Being an English major I'd probably throw my cap in with the former, but, as the princesses Rhyme and Reason make clear, the two are of equal value.  The book's plot is not a particularly new one.  Anybody familiar with any basic quest story, be it \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" (to which this has many similarities), \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\" or even \\"Haroun and the Sea of Stories\\" will recognize this book's form.  What sets it apart from the rest is not only the world in which Milo finds himself abroad, but the character of Milo himself.  Here is a boy with a serious deficiency.  He is Maurice Sendak's \\"Pierre\\" and he simply does not care.  By meeting the residents of a world of everything from words and numbers to colors and sounds, Milo comes to understand that the more one learns, the farther one can travel.<br />Filled with sly puns and clever ideas the book is a real delight.  The king of Dictionopolis is named Azaz.  There is a boy who is only .58 of a person and who patiently explains that in his land every family has 2.58 children. He is simply that .58.  Things like that.  A lot of this books sails swimmingly over the heads of children, while a couple other moments sail swimmingly over the heads of most adults.  It's worth it to pay attention to Juster's writing too.  Though prone to silliness, the author is equally comfortable spouting text like, \\"Have you ever heard the wonderful silence just before the dawn?...Or the quiet and calm just as a storm ends? Or perhaps you know the silence when you haven't the answer to a question you've been asked, or the hush of a country road at night, or the expectant pause in a roomful of people when someone is just about to speak, or most beautiful of all, the moment after the door closes and you're all alone in the whole house?\\"  I love passages like this.  Juster is the rare author that can make you laugh and then pause for thought within a scant two or three sentences.<br />As I said at the beginning, in spiteof all the good reviews this book has received, I still feel that, \\"The Phantom Toolbooth\\" is unappreciated in this day and age.  Where's its movie?  Its official fan club?  Its annotated editions?  Alas, I feel we'll have to wait until the novel receives the acclaim of which it is utterly and entirely deserving.

It's funny, because though I clearly remember seeing images from this book on the walls of libraries, cut out in bookstores, and displayed proudly in textbooks, I never read it myself.  And you know what?  It's an absolutely wonderful book that I am repeatedly regretting and regretting not having read.  This story is right up my alley, and it's an amazing tale.  In effect, it is a book about the power of redemption and the simplicity of doing what is right, no matter how late in the game.  Said author/illustrator Tomi Ungerer himself, \\"Whatever the color of money, it is never too late to make good use of it\\".  For me, this book is the story of how to make the most of your goods while you've got `em.<br /><br />The tale concerns itself with the doings of three fierce black-clad robbers.  Outfitted with a blunderbuss, a pepper-blower, and a huge red axe, the three had a pretty good gig going.  One robber would stop carriage horses with his pepper spray, another would stop the carriage completely by destroying the wheels with an axe, and the third would rob the passengers by holding them up with his blunderbuss.  Honestly?  I just like writing the word blunderbuss.  That's a great word.  Anyway, one day the men stop a carriage containing a small orphan on her way to live with a \\"wicked aunt\\".  They rescue her and take her home to live with them.  When the child asks them what they intend to do with all of their money, the men are stumped.  Their solution is round up all the, \\"lost, unhappy, and abandoned children\\" they can find, buy a castle, and move in with all the children.  In the end the kids grow up and build three tall high-roofed towers in honor of their foster fathers, the three robbers.  The end.<br /><br />I don't really know why I love this tale as much as I do.  Partly I think it has to do with the illustrations.  The robbers are black on blue, their white eyes floating in front of invisible blue faces.  Their weapons, colorfully displayed against a sharp black background, are a beautiful mixture of oranges, blues, and swirling reds.  Cheery and intense.  After they move in with the children, however, the black and blue palette changes completely and suddenly it's all bright reds (as the children are wearing) and deep spring greens.  Accompanying this adept change of pace is Ungerer's text.  The book never really explains the robbers' change of heart.  One suspects they robbed without entirely knowing why they did so.  And isn't that the case of most rich robbers?  It is apparent that their care for the children is true and tender.  I was especially attached to the shot of the once malevolent robber cradling the sleepy orphan girl in his warm cape as he took her home to stay.<br />The tale has a moral that changes with every reading.  Suffice to say, for me this book was about the human heart.  Sometimes it takes very little to change behaviors that once seemed so cold and logical.  Any picture book that can present such an interpretation deserves a close reading.  \\"The Three Robbers\\" fits that bill nicely.lly displayed against a sharp black background, are a beautiful mixture of oranges, blues, and swirling reds.

Sort of. Fixing his attention wholly on India, the author has penned another fantastic series of adventures. The basis of this books are the classic fairy tales, folktales, animal fables, and teaching-stories found throughout Indian culture and history. As such, this story could have felt like a mad-cap gluing together of all these disparate stories. Instead, the book is a smoothly flowing, if naggingly familiar, epic for the young.<br /><br /> King Tamar is young for his station in life, but he rules his small kingdom with grace and skill. When a fellow king arrives one day and insists on an all-stakes gambling match with Tamar, the younger man finds himself having bet away his own life to the fellow. Soon thereafter no one else in his palace remembers the mysterious visitor, but Tamar finds himself wearing an iron ring, the very physical embodiment of his debt. To determine whether not his wager was real or just a dream, Tamar embarks on a quest to find the other king and to settle once and for all what he owes. Along the way he picks up a variety of traveling companions. Amongst them are his own tutor Rajaswami, the beautiful gopi Mirri, Hashkat who is king of the monkeys, the ever complaining eagle Garuda, king Ashwara, and a very odd fellow named Adi-Kavi. Have no fear. Their names, as well as the names of every other character in this book, are collected in an index for easy reference for the easily confused reader. Embarking on a series of adventures with his crazy crew, Tamar learns much about the world outside his kingdom and what it truly means to be a warrior and a king.<br /><br /> This book was so similar to several of the &quot;Prydain Chronicles&quot; that it was all I could do to keep from noticing the fact on every other line. Consider. In the &quot;Prydain Chronicles&quot; a boy named Taran must learn to control his aggression in the face of hostility, discover what it truly means to be a warrior, and deserve the love of the fair Eilonwy.

Some of these attempts verged on the callous (paper cut airplanes flying into paper cut buildings) while others were nice thoughts but ultimately raised more questions than they answered (\\"Fireboat\\", for example).  In the case of Mr. Mordicai Gerstein, however, a happy medium was reached.  Here is a book that is all about the Twin Towers, but it does not linger on their fate.  A mere two years after the events of 9/11, this book is an eloquent and elegant elegy to a moment when the Twin Towers helped to bring the world a great deal of wonder and joy.<br /><br />The story is based on the true tale of one Philippe Petit.  A French aerialist, Petit was adept at juggling, unicycle riding, and (as it happened) tightrope walking.  When construction finished on the Twin Towers in 1974, Petit happened upon the crazy notion of walking between them.  The man was no stranger to such a stunt.  He had, after all, walked between the towers of the Notre Dame Cathedral back in his native France.  After asking the Tower's owners for permission, his request was quickly declined.  To be allowed would fly in the face of a million safety regulations, after all.  The quick thinking Petit reasoned that all that was left was to go ahead and do it anyway.  Involving some friends, a construction disguise, and a four hundred and forty pound reel of cable, Petit successfully made it to the roof of one tower in the night and connected the line between the towers with help.  Then, as the dawn broke, he did his famous walk across.  Once finished, Petit was sentenced by a judge to perform for the children of the park as his penance; a punishment the artist suffered gladly.  The book concludes the story on a wistful note.  We view the space where once the towers stood and read, \\"Now the towers are gone\\".  A ghost of the Two appears on the next page and the book says, \\"But in memory, as if imprinted on the sky, the towers are still there.  And part of that memory is the joyful morning, August 7, 1974, when Philippe Petit walked between them in the air\\".<br /><br />What Gerstein has done is give us a memory of the Twin Towers that is a good and joyful one.  This is no mean task, especially when you consider the horrors that were to follow.  I've heard an interesting assortment of objections to the book in my time.  Some people argue that no book about the Twin Towers is appropriate for children, whether the book concentrates on 9/11 or not.  Such sentiments are silly.  You can't ignore the past and, when done tastefully, a book about a significant event can teach more to children than a lesson plan could ever hope to.  Other objections say that the book glorifies a silly stunt.  Considering the fact that Petit was well trained, took all the necessary precautions, and did what he did for the love of his art, this objection is petty at best.  Some say that this is not Gerstein's strongest work and that he should have won the Caldecott for another book instead.  I have not read other Gerstein creations, so my experience is (like that of the Caldecott committee) limited to only his most recent creation.  But to say this book is not medal worthy is patently ridiculous.  Just at glance at the book is enough to tell you that.<br /><br />Look with me.  The text is not only true, it is respectful.  What I'm about to write here is second-hand knowledge garnered from a children's literature listserv, so I can't vouch that what I'm about to say is true.  However, I believe that before this book was published Philippe Petit knew that it was being written and requested a look at the galleys prior to publication (not a ridiculous desire considering he was the book's star and hero).  Such a look was not granted but just after publication Petit was allowed a copy of the story and he greatly approvedof it.  The only correction he wished to make was the section discussing the thickness of the cable he walked across.  I believe he wished it to be changed from five-sixths of an inch to seven-eights of an inch.  Future books have been published with this change, so if you happen to have an earlier printing of the story you may have a collector's item on your hands.  My point with this story is the pains with which the author has taken to render everything in it factual.  On top of that, it's very well written, with the viewer gasping and cheering with every close shave and near accident Petit incurs.<br /><br />As for the illustrations, they are utterly lovely.  From the windswept cover (note the very American bald eagle flying below Petit) to the large pull out sections showing both Petit's walk and the height at which he was walking.  If you can read through this book and successfully suppress all shudders then you're a better man than I, Gunga Din.  Best of all is how evocative the tale is.  The title page displays the towers being built on a snowy day, and there is a repetitive motif of parents holding up babies to look at Petit.  This book is filled with delicate wonders and scintillating details on every page.<br /><br />I can't imagine how anyone could dislike this story, but some do.  Just the same, if you want a picture book filled with beauty and breath-taking adventure, with one happy ending and one wistful ending apiece, select Gerstein's award winning creation.  It deserves its applause.The only correction he wished to make was the section discussing the thickness of the cable he walked across.

It's redundant.  Yes, of course the poor Baudelaire siblings are in dire straights.  But as it happens, this book is a little different from the others in the series.  Suddenly the siblings are placed in the predicament of attempting to save someone other than themselves from the evil Count Olaf.  Worse still, they have to actively try to find the Count when the heat is on.  Such a strange reversal of fortunes is just what the series needed to liven it up a bit.  Consider \\"The Ersatz Elevator\\" very lively indeed.<br />No more boarding schools for the Baudelaire orphans.  Mr. Poe, their ineffectual guardian, has once more placed them with relatives, no matter how distant.  In this particular case, the Squalors are the couple of choice.  Horrendously rich and living in a ridiculously large penthouse, the children find themselves with a woman who is apparently solely concerned with what is \\"in\\" and what is \\"out\\".  Acqueous martinis (water with an olive) are in.  Elevators, especially the one that would let the children get to the penthouse with ease, are out.  Orphans, as it happens, are also in.  Unfortunately, before the kids can find out what happens to orphans when they become \\"out\\" they run once more into the nasty Count Olaf.  Disguised now as a foreign auctioneer, the Count seems to have increased in both nastiness and cleverness.  It takes everything the Baudelaires have to work against this man and try to locate their friends, the captive Quagmire triplets.<br />The book is, more than anything else, a delightful trumping of the rich.  With his finger planted firmly on the elite's obsession with the latest fad, Esme Squalor is nothing so much as a living breathing caricature of sublime ineptitude.  When asked why she won't give money to a family who is poor and has lost their home, she reasons that if she gave them money they wouldn't be poor anymore.  Such is the mindset of the many people who just don't happen to put it in so many words.<br />There are some real surprises in this latest book.  I don't mind telling you that there were two moment of real breath taking shock for me in this book.  The first occurred after Violet, Klaus, and Sunny discover something unexpected at the bottom of the ersatz elevator.  The second occured when a character plunged the Bauldelaires into terrifying and certain danger.  Fabulous.<br />The ending of this book is a little more dour than that of the previous ones, but let it never be said that the author doesn't end the books on a hopeful note.  Rest assured that in the end, the three siblings can stand strong as they always have, no matter what horrendous things happen to them.  And just a note: The plot is thickening more and more.  Characters are giving away clues to the mysterious VFD.  Beatrice's name is coming from a mouth other than the author's.  And the Baudelaires find themselves in a very familiar sooty place, much to their amazement.  Be sure to read the most exciting Unfortunate Event yet!  It'll be sure to raise more questions than it answers...hey wouldn't be poor anymore.

I think the kind of Kellogg book you love says a lot about the kind of person you are.  For example, I'd probably have my doubts about being stuck in an elevator with anyone who professes a love for Kellogg's \\"How Much is a Million\\" books.  And as for the person who gravitates towards the \\"Pinkerton\\" series, that's the kind of human being I'd be comfortable sharing a cup of cocoa with.  Now myself, I'm torn.  The vote really falls between Kellogg's fascinating \\"Island of the Skog\\" and \\"The Mysterious Tadpole\\".  Both books are fabulous forgotten classics.  But \\"The Mysterious Tadpole\\" is better known and perhaps deservedly so.<br /><br />Louis has just had a birthday, and his eccentric Uncle McAlister has sent him the best present ever.  A small lovable tadpole arrives in the mail, and Louis sets about making his new pet at home.  Contrary to expectations, however, the tadpole (named, curiously, Alphonse) grows by leaps and bounds.  When Louis's parents protest that Alphonse is too large to keep in the home, Louis improvises by placing his pet in the Junior High's swimming pool.  But when even that clever plan goes awry, it's up to  Louise and the local librarian Miss Seevers to concoct a plan to keep Alphonse happy and free.<br /><br />Perhaps it was this book, read to me countless times in my youth, that is responsible for me becoming the librarian I am today.  Miss Seevers isn't your frumpy hair in a bun, glasses on her nose, shushing librarian either.  She's a smart witty woman who helps Louis to save the day.  In fact all the characters in this book are imbued with a certain amount of pep and verve.  Louis is just the kind of kid who wants to keep his tadpole/loch ness monster safe.  And Alphonse, though he never says a word, is a child's ideal pet.  Imagine it.  A big friendly adorable brown-eyed monster that would like nothing more than to eat some cheeseburgers, romp, and play fetch.  As for the story itself, it's got it all.  A funny plot, a memorable solution, and a sly surprise ending with a whole different story suggested.  The book is also filled with Kellogg's wry understatements.  In this book, Louis's teacher Mrs. Shelbert has asked him to bring Alphonse in continually so that the class could see how a tadpole becomes a frog.  Soon enough Alphonse is romping around the room, roughly five children on his back and more clammering to climb aboard, paper airplanes flying, and desks askew.  As a disapproving teacher looks on, the text merely says, \\"One day Mrs. Shelbert decided that Alphonse was not turning into an ordinary frog.  She asked Louis to stop bringing him to school\\".  Understatement at its finest.<br /><br />Kellogg's illustrations really give this book the extra little nudge it needed to cross over from \\"merely good\\" to \\"fantastic\\".  Alphonse, for one, could not be cuter.  Those big brown puppy dog eyes would inspire you to buy him a million hamburgers, if you could.  Kellogg is also adept at filling each scene in the book with tiny amusing details.  For example, when Louis smuggles Alphonse into the Junior High, you can see the name of the school is the \\"Jesse James Junior High School\\".  Two masked and armed statues hold their guns on either side of the entrance.  At another point, Louis thinks horribly of his pet being placed in a zoo, while a dreaming Alphonse pictures himself as tiny next to the largest cheeseburger in the world.  The book is filled with delights such as these.  My personal favorite is perhaps the most controversial section of the book.  When Miss Seevers proposes locating some sunken pirate treasure sunk in the city's harbor, there is an image of Miss Seevers and Louis imagining the sinking of the ship.  A huge ship (named the Poison Prune) sinks in the harbor, filled with nasty evil pirates.  The cause of the sinkage?  A single Native American, smiling, shoots arrows into the hull.  I love it.  The Native American is obviously in command of the situation while the pirates, for all their guns and nasty looks, are bound for the briny deep.  It's a great moment, though I've no doubt there's the possibility that people might find the scene offensive.  Frankly, it's not, but you'll just have to take my word on this one until you read the book yourself.<br /><br />So there you have it.  One of the world's best books written by one of the world's best author/illustrators and virtually forgotten today.  If you can get your hands on a copy of this book, do so immediately.  It's a fine piece of well wrought literature, enough to make you wish there had been a sequel.  If this book had been written today, I've no doubt that there would have been.  As it stands, however, this book is the one and only.  And it's well worth any price you could pay.an is obviously in command of the situation while the pirates, for all their guns and nasty looks, are bound for the briny deep.

On perusing it, the reader would almost think Mr. de Paola stole Mr. Marshall's sketch book to concoct it.  Filling his tale with an assortment of well dressed animals, author/illustrator Tomie de Paola makes a quick departure from his usual picture book fare.  Originally published in the book, \\"Four Stories for Four Seasons\\", this is a light hearted look at summer and the pleasures that come with having good friends for company.<br />Our tale concerns four Victorian-aged ladies and gentlemen; Mister Frog, Mistress Pig, Missy Cat, and Master Dog.  Their adventures are rather low key, as is best befitting well-to-do animals.  The four take strolls, go boating, and plant gardens for their own enjoyment.  The arc of this tale is a droll one.  No great catastrophic occurrences take place, unless you count Mister Frog upsetting the boat whilst singing a line from \\"H.M.S. Pinafore\\".  All in all, it's a hazy lazy story that simply looks at the characters and views them enjoying one another's presence.  There are no morals to learn nor surprise endings (though some might contest me on that).  The illustrations are entirely in keeping with the late Victorian feel.  The ladies carry parasols and wear elaborately concocted hats.  The gentlemen sport jaunty beanies and straw hats, as well as bow ties and neckerchiefs.  The color scheme is a light-infused pastel outing and the entire enterprise is simply laid back and peaceful.  Though not my favorite de Paola by far, this book is sure to attract some admirers, if only for its take on what some might have called a \\"simpler time\\".	2004-05-03

I was read this book repeatedly as a child and the images in it made a deep deep impression on my young moldable little brain. A classic tale of letting one's children lead their own lives (and about seeing the world a little) was much beloved by a much younger me. Better still, I think it really is the primary reason why I love autumn so much. No book better captures the scents, smells, and crisp fall feeling than this wonderful (and out of print) picture book.<br />Mother Mouse lives beneath the roots of an old oak tree with her three children, Minnikin, Midgie, and Moppet. The children dream of someday living in homes of their own. Minnikin imagines he will live in a farmer's barn. Midgie dreams of a home by the markets. Moppet decides to someday become a city mouse and live in a city apartment. When the time comes to leave, Mother Mouse decides to visit each of her children after they establish their new homes. As she goes to each child, Mother Mouse finds their living situations strange and scary. By the end, however, she realizes that every home has its attractions and perils. And eventually the children return to the meadow to take care of their mother, wed, and raise their own mouse families in the roots of the old oak tree.<br />The story is quite interesting in its narrative and morals. As far as I can determine, the book is basically saying that while it is well and good for the young to traipse off to exciting and dangerous places while they've their youth, when it comes to settling down it's nicest to find a safe meadow where you can raise a family and take care of your mother. Not your usual pre-school plot, by far. I love how Adelaide Holl has chosen to describe scenes in this story. The dialogue is a little formal but it never sounds forced or strained. Accompanying the tale are Priscilla Hillman's masterful illustrations. These are what really stuck with me over the years. They contain some of the most realistic mice I've ever seen, albeit wearing dresses and overalls. Their big black pupil-less eyes and quick furry noses are just adorable. While the mice do not usually show much in the way of expression, whenever they close their eyes in sleep or joy you can see just a hint of a smile curling at the edges of their mouths. But it's food and the seasons that are done best here. I remembered well the spicy sausages and delicate gourmet cheeses. The huge orange pumpkins and ripe round apples. But best of all are Mother Mouse's trips through the countryside. Hillman has perfectly captured the craggy tattered elements of the fall.

Having just finished reviewing \\"Swimmy\\", the 1963 predecessor to \\"Finding Nemo\\", it seems fitting that I should also review \\"There's a Nightmare In My Closet\\", the 1968 predecessor to \\"Monsters, Inc.\\"  Looking like nothing so much as an alternative, \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\", Mercer Mayer's late 60s concoction is a tale of how a small boy stands up to his fears and finds them not to be as scary as he had thought.<br />Told in the first person, the story tells how a young boy, outfitted in those cute footie pajamas with the flap in the back, used to be scared of the nightmare in his closet before going to bed.  Each night the boy would close the closet door then hide under his sheets.  That all changes the night the boy pops on his general's helmet and outfits himself with a toy canon, toy soldiers, and a pop gun to rid himself of his nightmare once and for all.  Sure enough, when the lights are out the monster comes creeping and perches on the foot of the bed but the boy is ready.  He threatens it to leave and when he shoots his pop gun the nightmare bursts into tears.  It's really a pitiful sight.  Relenting, the boy tucks the monster in his bed, closes the closet door, and snuggles down to share the bed with his nightmare.  As the boy ends the tale with, \\"I suppose there's another nightmare in my closet, but my bed's not big enough for three\\", sure enough, another monster sticks out his head and smiles winningly at the reader whilst the two others sleep blissfully.<br />When you think of all the mediocre monster books out there, this story really is remarkable.  Compare this book to \\"Go Away, Big Green Monster\\", for example.  There's just no comparison.  And for its 1968 publication date, the story really feels very contemporary.  The adept pen and ink illustrations combine successfully with the no-nonsense tone of the narration to produce a real class act.  The boy in the pictures really does resemble All in all, this is just a nice story about confronting your fears and finding that sometimes they're not as bad as you think.  You have to love the illustrations as well.  The single shot of the nightmare tucked in the bed gesturing worriedly at the open closet door is so very sad.  Any child that's a fan of the aforementioned \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" will love this story as well.  A sweet tale with a lovely moral.  I just can't recommend it enough.this is just a nice story about confronting your fears and finding that sometimes they're not as bad as you think.  You have to love the illustrations as well.

Remembering reading a myriad of different reviews for this book when it first came out, I can recall some of the strongest criticism of it at the time.  \\"Oh the book's too adoring of Kurt Cobain\\".  \\"Oh the book spends too much time idealizing a dead drugged out rocker\\".  \\"Oh the book can't be good because it's subject is so grimy\\".  I'm paraphrasing of course, but these were the general comments directed at K.L. Going's first young adult novel.  So I picked it up and read it and found that I relearned something that I need to constantly be reminded of time and again.  Sometimes reviewers haven't a clue about really well written and worthwhile material.  With that statement in mind (and me perfectly aware that I'm going to follow it up with, bum bum ba dum, a review) I present to you a book that I felt was deeply moving, touching, and downright hilarious.<br />We open with our hero, Troy Billings, contemplating whether or not his suicide in front of a subway train will be amusing to the passersby.  Troy is, after all, gargantuan.  He's seventeen, six feet tall, and about three hundred pounds.  He's lived his life in the face of constant ridicule and for once he's contemplating ending it there and then.  His life is spared, however, by a chance meeting with a dirty grungy krustypunk kid sitting on the ground.  This kid, as it turns out, is Curt MacCrae, local dropout rock god.  An unlikely friendship blooms between these two, and Curt becomes absolutely 100 percent convinced that Troy is the drummer for him.  Troy, of course, hasn't touched drums since the seventh grade, but Curt is oblivious to the problem.  As the book follows these characters, Curt saves Troy's life in a myriad of different ways and Troy, ultimately, finds a way to save Curt's.<br />This is the ultimate anti-b.s. book.  Troy says exactly what he's thinking without fooling either himself or the reader.  No fool, Troy is constantly aware that people find him peculiar to look at.  To the book's credit, when Troy is convinced that something is going to fail he sometimes does.  And Troy is capable of some magnificent failures in this story.  At the same time, he's witty and urbane.  And [attractive].  This guy is like any other seventeen year-old boy, and he's really got a thing for the wrists of attractive waitresses.  The book uses slang without sounding dated or affected, and there's enough good natured profanity to lure kids into reading it.  Curt is also the perfect spaz foil to Troy's oversized self.  A sneaky slimy but ultimately fantastic friend to T (as he likes to call Troy) Curt is what Kurt Cobain could have become if he'd just befriended someone like the T-man at age twenty.  You never doubt Curt's love for his new friend, even though his steadfast acceptance of Troy and all of Troy's fears is somewhat difficult to understand.  Troy himself doesn't understand it fully, but it's everything he's ever wanted.  This is the story of the unpopular fat kid getting picked by the popular punk at school and how it changes both their lives.<br />I was hoping to get all the way through the book without hitting any snags or plot devices.  For the most part, this book's pretty snag free.  Sadly, though the book was written by a woman, the women portrayed in the story are few and far between.  They pretty much end up being either waitresses or groupies.  Hopefully Going's next book will give her gender a little more breathing room.  Also, after reading through this tale I did end up wishing that Going had left it up to the reader to understand why Troy gained weight after his mother's death without explaining it, but it ties in nicely with the ways in which Troy's dad and brother also dealt with the tragedy.  I loved how Troy could detect fear or emotional distress while watching others eat.  And I just liked Troy.  He's a likable guy, which is a huge bonus if you're going to read a book like this.  If you didn't likeeither Troy or Curt you'd have a rough time getting through the story.  Fortunately, Going is a skilled enough writer that you can read Troy's many worries and fears about his size without finding him whiny or oppressive.  He has a sardonic sense of humor that saves him every time.  I was disappointed by the ending of the book, though.  Up until then, I had been pleased to see that Going wasn't making anything easy for her characters.  Unfortunately the finale (and I won't give it away) seems a bit too pat.  Too neat.  And, in a way, too easy.  I didn't want an unhappy ending, mind you, but I didn't like the way in which Troy instantly becomes close to his father and brother after years of estrangement.<br />One last note on Going's writing.  This is a woman who knows how to write a good musical sequence.  I haven't read such poetic descriptions of rock since Emma Bull's lively, \\"War of the Oaks\\".  This is a woman who knows how to make the pages wail with sound and color.  When Troy feels elated at his first concert, you stand right there feeling elated with him.  The book's all right.  It's perhaps not the best teen novel out there these days, but it's a pretty good one just the same.  I suggest you try it on for size.  Even if you can't stand rock or Nirvana, this tale has the ability to take you out of yourself and into the head of a three hundred pound boy.

Better still, I think it really is the primary reason why I love autumn so much.  No book better captures the scents, smells, and crisp fall feeling than this wonderful (and out of print) picture book.<br />Mother Mouse lives beneath the roots of an old oak tree with her three children, Minnikin, Midgie, and Moppet.  The children dream of someday living in homes of their own.  Minnikin imagines he will live in a farmer's barn.  Midgie dreams of a home by the markets.  Moppet decides to someday become a city mouse and live in a city apartment.  When the time comes to leave, Mother Mouse decides to visit each of her children after they establish their new homes.  As she goes to each child, Mother Mouse finds their living situations strange and scary.  By the end, however, she realizes that every home has its attractions and perils.  And eventually the children return to the meadow to take care of their mother, wed, and raise their own mouse families in the roots of the old oak tree.<br />The story is quite interesting in its narrative and morals.  As far as I can determine, the book is basically saying that while it is well and good for the young to traipse off to exciting and dangerous places while they've their youth, when it comes to settling down it's nicest to find a safe meadow where you can raise a family and take care of your mother.  Not your usual pre-school plot, by far.  I love how Adelaide Holl has chosen to describe scenes in this story.  The dialogue is a little formal but it never sounds forced or strained.  Accompanying the tale are Priscilla Hillman's masterful illustrations.  These are what really stuck with me over the years.  They contain some of the most realistic mice I've ever seen, albeit wearing dresses and overalls.  Their big black pupil-less eyes and quick furry noses are just adorable.  While the mice do not usually show much in the way of expression, whenever they close their eyes in sleep or joy you can see just a hint of a smile curling at the edges of their mouths.  But it's food and the seasons that are done best here.  I remembered well the spicy sausages and delicate gourmet cheeses.  The huge orange pumpkins and ripe round apples.  But best of all are Mother Mouse's trips through the countryside.  Hillman has perfectly captured the craggy tattered elements of the fall.  The grey skies that at any moment can open up into rain and the warm comfort of a bed when you're scared.<br />\\"Minnikin, Midgie, and Moppet\\" is one of the best little known picture books out there.

White's, \\"The Sword in the Stone\\" and I've a funny bit of affection in my heart for the Disney animated version of the film.  Coming to Robert San Souci's 1997 version of the story (one in a series of tales told about the younger versions of characters in the Arthurian tales), \\"Young Arthur\\" had some definite potential.  Robert San Souci has, after all, retold multiple adept classics like, \\"Sootface\\" or \\"Fa Mulan\\", amongst others.  So I opened up this book and found, to my amazement, that is was just no good.  Not a jot.  It is sloppily told, poorly illustrated, and a great deal less interesting than its original sources.<br />The story follows the birth and subsequent discovery of Arthur, son of King Uther.  We begin with a bizarre view of Stonehenge (yes, Stonehenge) where the king and Merlin (who is never really described or explained in this book) view the shape of a dragon, apparently foretelling the greatness of Arthur.  When evil rebels (?!) threaten the life of the child, Merlin hides the babe with a Lord and Lady to be raised by them.  The boy grows up with his foster brother Kay and is squired to Kay when the elder brother becomes a knight.  When Merlin produces the sword in a stone as a means of locating the kingdom's rightful ruler, Arthur is the only one able to pull it out and he goes on to unite his people and free the land of tyranny.  The end.<br />The text of the story is, according to an author's note, drawing on at least nine different Authurian sources.  Everything from Alfred Lord Tennyson's, \\"King Arthur: Tales of the Round Table\\" to Geoffrey Ashe's \\"The Quest for Arthur's Britain\\".  I wish I could say that it is as full and rich a story as you could hope could be attained from such prestigious sources.  Alas this is not the case.  The story seems like nothing so much as a variation on the Disney movie, recasting Kay as a greedy unlikable older brother and Arthur without flaw.  Because the tale does not end with Arthur's coronation, we are privy to scenes of him fighting rebels, flying with Merlin, and defeating others in battle.  For those kids interested in war, this is a fine (if uninformative) text.  All in all, though I was unimpressed with the final product, the book could have remained perfectly all right if the narrative was the only flaw.  There is, however, the illustrator to content with.<br />From the moment you view the cover of this book, you may begin to suspect you're in trouble.  Illustrator Jamichael Henterly has created a work that, despite its 1997 publication date, looks like nothing so much as a product of the late 1980s.  The phrase, \\"poorly drawn\\" doesn't do it justice.  This artist has no sense of movement or proportion.  In a fight scene between Kay and Arthur (Kay looking roughly 39 and Arthur 35 despite their stated ages of 19 and 15, respectively) Kay has apparently swung his sword at his brother.  But the picture looks static and posed.  In every shot of this book, characters seem to have been froze just after or just before they were about to move.  The shot of Arthur pulling the sword from the stone in front of a crowd had a very He-Man from Masters of the Universe feel.  Entirely apart from that is just how cheap the entire enterprise feels.  The book is gaudy.  It seems to try to minimize the poor illustrations of the people by occasionally tossing a Celtic band or design on the opposite page.  Characters with sometimes wear Celtic broaches or fight in halls where dragons appear on tapestries.  Too little too late, says I.  Henterly obviously didn't do any research or take any real interest in the authentic Arthurian England, leaving most of these pictures to appear as the cardboard cut-outs we've already seen so many times before.  There is nothing new, exciting, or different about this book.<br />To call this picture book a travesty is a bit much.  Let's just call it a failure.  The pictures are poorly drawn, the story is repetitive and dry, and the entire presentation is cheap.  There are plenty of lovely Arthurian stories out there.  Most will have illustrations that impress and some may even take your breath away.  Why waste your time pouring over this pale pitiful hodgepodge of legend, myth, and text when there are so many better books in the world?  Please don't waste a flicker of an eyelash (let alone a cent) on this book.  It's just not worth it.ry is repetitive and dry, and the entire presentation is cheap.

This interesting monstrosity takes a book that was previous perfect and renders it perverse.  I am reviewing the original Beatrix Potter edition of this tale, but because Amazon.com doesn't like to differentiate reviews, I'm fairly certain that this review will also appear for the McPhail book as well.  Please, dear readers, do not in any way shape or form purchase the McPhail version if you want the original adept \\"Peter Rabbit\\"!  Where Potter is adept and charming, McPhail is syrupy and doe-eyed.  Where Potter is subtle, McPhail is over the top.  Where Potter succeeds, McPhail fails.  To locate an original edition of \\"The Tale of Peter Rabbit\\" click on the author \\"Beatrix Potter\\" as it appears at the top of this screen.  That should bring you to a selection of choices, one of which is the original \\"The Tale of Peter Rabbit\\".  Oddly, the only way to purchase that particular original version of the tale is to select her name.  I don't know why.  Call it a flaw in the Amazon.com system, if you will.<br />Now, why doesn't Peter Rabbit age?  I'm not being literal here, people, so please don't inundate me with explanations that patiently explain that fictional characters in books cannot get old.  I won't hear a word of it.  Reading \\"Peter Rabbit\\" today is just as fresh and new an experience as it was one hundred years ago.  Author Beatrix Potter created the story of Peter Rabbit for a young boy with whom she was acquainted.  Using the novel idea of drawing animals as they appeared in nature, just in funny clothes and talking, her books are remarkable because she had a dual talent for both illustration and clever narrative.  Now after all these years I opened up \\"Peter Rabbit\\" to see why I loved it as much as I did as a kid.  And the fact of the matter is, it hasn't aged a smidgen.  A remarkable and astounding feat for a story originally published in 1903.<br />Peter lives, as many of us know, in a large fir tree with his mother and his siblings Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail.  His father was baked in a pie (a fact that many parents have decried as too dark for children, and that many children have shrugged at without a second thought).  Though instructed by his mother NOT to go digging in Mr. McGregor's garden, he's a naughty little thing.  His tasty trip is brought up short, however, when he stumbles across the farmer himself.  In the course of their chase Peter loses his little blue jacket with the shiny brass buttons and must return to his mother (after a series of close shaves) without it or his shoes.  He is promptly put to bed with a cup of camomile tea (a fate we non-camomile tea drinkers must assume is harsh) while his siblings eat the tasty blackberries they picked that morning.<br /><br />Beatrix Potter claimed that though she was adept at illustrating animals, she had the darndest time (my words, not hers) drawing people.  You will note, therefore, that Mr. McGregor is a bit of a featureless wag.  The story was remarkable in that it was the first time (I believe) that animals drawn in a picture book actually looked like real animals.  Peter is exactly the kind of bunny you'd expect to catch in your yard, except that he's occasionally wearing jaunty spring wear.  The similarities in this tale to that of the Brer Rabbit tales of the American South is interesting but due to the fact that Potter was writing this story in 1903 Britain, she probably didn't steal the plot.  The book is a classic in the purest sense, of course.  If you can get a copy that is small (intended from the start to be the size that little hands could open easily) do.  It's a beautiful tale that is as fresh and green today as it was when written long long ago.

687071:US	49148452	R3EXUIFM25BXYB	0833578642	138228017	Nine Days to Christmas	Books	4	11	12	N	N	On the ninth day till Christmas my true love gave to me...	I've never seen a book quite like it.  Originally published in 1959, and winner of the 1960 Caldecott medal, \\"Nine Days to Christmas\\" is the tale of Ceci and her pi&ntilde;ata.  Ceci is five years old, and at long last her mother has consented to hold a posada (Christmas party) that Ceci may attend.  Ceci is delighted, and when choosing a pi&ntilde;ata for the posada she grows horribly attached to one in the shape of a beautiful star.  When the time comes to break the pi&ntilde;ata into pieces, however, Ceci is understandably distraught.  Fortunately, the very nature of pi&ntilde;atas rectifies the situation and Ceci finds comfort in the season.<br />Both visually and textually this book is an original.  Ets's Ceci is definitely five years of age.  Her every move and thought confirms her youth and excitement at finally getting to participate in the first of nine Christmas parties.  What's nice about the story is the amount of time and attention the author pays to the day-to-day living of a wealthy Mexican family like Ceci's.  She displays the world around Ceci without ever ignoring the poor or impoverished.  Though Ceci is too young to make any judgments about the way the world is, she knows enough to observe a man too poor to own shoes or village women selling flowers.  The book never trivializes the situation of the people, and it grants servants the same respect as their employers.  I was especially taken with the section in which the servant girls mix and mingle while waiting for the garbage truck to arrive.  It's nice to see someone besides the rich having lives of their own in a picture book.  My only objection is the author's dedication at the front.  She writes, \\"To all the little Mexican friends and relatives who helped us make this book\\".  I'm going to assume that by \\"little\\" she is referring to the children.<br />The story is rather original for its publication date.  I can't imagine that too many kids books with South American plots were making their way into mainstream America in the late 1950s.  Above and beyond the storyline, however, are Aurora Labastida's amazing illustrations.  Here is an illustrator that matches Ets's well-paced story and dialogue with a true knowledge of Mexican culture.  It's such a relief to see Ceci staring transfixed at a Christmastime market that looks so doggone realistic.  And when Ceci and her mother stand on the street, the stores and marquees they pass are all written in Spanish (with the possible exception of the transposed Dairy Queen).<br />Labastida's style is particularly original as well.  Most faces of characters are realistic to the point where I began to wonder if Labastida was drawing from photographs.  These characters are drawn with pencil, as are the backgrounds and settings.  Yet minute carefully selected portions of each picture are colored in beautifully.  Ceci's clothing is always colorful and easy to spot.  Using this technique, the artist is able to draw the viewer's eye to the parts of the illustration she wants you to pay the most attention to.  The effect is both appropriate and beautifully done.  If I've any real criticism of the pictures presented in this book it might be directed towards the pi&ntilde;atas.  For some reason, Labasta has drawn incredibly cartoony pi&ntilde;atas, floating in an otherwise realistic setting.  The effect is jarring, without necessarily ruining the experience of reading the book.  I was also a little taken aback at how rarely we ever see Ceci's face, front and center.  In most of this book we get a very nice view of the back of her head.  Why this is, I'm uncertain.  But again, it's a stylistic choice that fits the book itself without drawing any particular attention to itself.<br /><br />In the end, I'm happy to report that \\"Nine Days to Christmas\\" is fully deserving of its Caldecott medal.  This was hardly a forgone conclusion.  I've read plenty of award winners that could have stood a little less attention.  In this book, however, you have a wonderful introduction for children into customs and celebrations sometimes found in Mexico.  Such a story rarely goes out of date.  In this case, I don't think it ever will.n for children into customs and celebrations sometimes found in Mexico.  Such a story rarely goes out of date.

The book combines your average counting book (or, in this case, counting backwards book) with a bedtime sleepy story.  Utilizing bright colors, interesting characters, and an eye for textures, author/illustrator Molly Bang has created a sweet simple story that does not annoy or condescend to the reader.<br />An African-American girl and her father count down to bedtime.  There are ten toes on her feet.  Nine fuzzy friends (including a clever and playful kitty).  Eight windowpanes displaying the snow outside.  It goes on. Each view of the bedroom is a comforting one.  The observant reader might wonder why there are only seven shoes straightened under the crib, only to find that when we observe the five buttons on the girl's gown, the cat is proceeding to happily gnaw on the missing shoe. The delicate interactions between the girl and her father are undoubtedly the most tender parts of the story.  Oftentimes we switch in the story from viewing things from the child's point of view (like her toes or her seashell mobile) to looking at the girl as she perches in her father's lap.  After some goodnight kisses and a big hug to her furry bear pet, it's off to bed for the sweet sleepy little one.  There is nothing in this book that will necessarily grab you by the guts and make you want to give this story to every man, woman, and child you know.  It's just a delicately woven lullaby that expresses almost wordlessly the affection that exists between a father and his daughter.  From the opening shot of the girl running to be in her dad's outstretched arms, to the final tucking in at the end of the night, the book touches a chord in the reader.  It is sweet without overpowering you with its saccharine nature.  Adorable without going overboard.  It is a beautifully balanced work of picture book art.	2004-04-29

The publishing world is always on a constant prowl for the \\"next\\" Harry Potter series.  Who is it that will steal the crown from Britain's reigning fantasy king?  One of the newest contenders comes in the form of Jonathan Stroud's detailed \\"Bartimaeus Trilogy\\".  The first book in this series \\"The Amulet of Samarkand\\" (other books have not, as of this review, been published in America yet) begins what many hope will become the new \\"it\\" series.  Cleverly combining facets of European and Asian lore, the book is a fascinating character study into the nature of good and bad.  Filled with far more complex imaginings than your average fantasy let's-throw-in-some-brief-historical-facts book, this tale is penned beautifully and is a worthy series within its own right.<br />We begin with a bang of a beginning.  Most authors, no matter if they are writing for adults or children, like to start slowly and build their tale with a heaping helping of exposition.  Not Stroud.  In this book we begin with an exciting summoning of the djinni Bartimaeus by a twelve year-old boy.  The boy, Nathaniel, wishes to avenge himself against a powerful wizard.  As the plot follows Bartimaeus's quest to retrieve the Amulet of Samarkand (as the boy has instructed him to do) we are simultaneously brought up to speed on Nathaniel's life and world.  This is London, but a sort of alternative reality London.  In this world, wizards rule over the commoners (non-magic types) in government positions and teach children as apprentices.  Nathaniel is such an apprentice, bound to an incompetent master.  When he is shamed in front of a group of wizards by one Simon Lovelace (a man far more powerful than his own master) Nathaniel seeks nothing but revenge.<br />So there you have it.  This is a tale about a boy and his smart alecky djinni.  As the book takes pains to explain, demons (like the djinni) are regularly summoned by wizards to do their dirty work.  Humans are, by and large, incapable of magic and simply summon spirits of one sort or another to do magic for them.  Bartimaeus isn't thrilled by this proposition, but he is unwillingly bound to a boy that burns with hate and a bit of the old \\"eye for an eye\\".  The djinni's displeasure is regularly voiced by clever footnotes placed strategically at the bottom of several pages.  Often Bartimaeus's commentary is the great spice of the book.  Nathaniel is a less than humorous individual, though he is capable of deadpan humor.  The book is, itself, an interesting fantasy.  Like the Artemis Fowl books, it has presented the reader with an unsympathetic hero.  In this case, you're dealing with a proud and intelligent but ultimately foolish boy.  Nathaniel is nothing so much as another version of Ged from Ursula LeGuin's \\"The Wizard of Earthsea\\".  The difference here, however, is that Nathaniel doesn't grow as much as you might suspect throughout the course of the story.  And here's where it all gets very very interesting.  The essential nature of what is good and what is bad is all topsy-turvy.  Bartimaeus is the rare character I've read in a fantasy story that is truly of an alien nature.  If he does good things for others, it's usually out of some self-preserving intention or accompanied with a sly jab.  Usually, Bartimaeus is willing to kill anyone and anything about him, including his own master.  Don't expect these characters to follow the old buddy movie routine and grow closer over the course of the tale.  These two have a lot of healthy distrust growing between them, and it's a pleasure to watch.  But how easy is it to read about two people that are, for all intents and purposes, fatally flawed?  Quite, as it happens.<br />I'm always amused at the amount of anti-\\"magic in Harry Potter\\" outrage there is in the world.  Let us consider this book, for example.  In this story you have characters regularly drawing pentacles on the ground to summon up demons from another realm.  If there's a more objectionable idea lodged ina children's book to a heavily religious right-wing Christian conservative, I'd love to hear it.  I will say right here and now that I, personally, don't find anything objectionable in this story.  Bartimaeus himself makes it very clear that he despises this system wherein demons are forced as slaves to work for humans.  On meeting up with an Uncle Tom type of demon, his venom is clearly displayed.  Moreover, the series seems to be taking a rather anti-magician stance, though this is elaborated on less in the plot of this first book than it will in future books in the series, I imagine.<br />The book is nothing so much as a cross between Artemis Fowl (more likable) and Harry Potter (more detailed) with a dash of Wizard of Earthsea for color.  Stroud's writing is fantastic.  He has obviously detailed every inch of this new world out to the nth degree, and you never get the sense that the book has gone on too long (a flaw I found in \\"Inkheart\\") or that he doesn't know how to end it.  I will state for the record that this is an incredibly enjoyable read.  Bartimeus even allows himself a small jab at the Harry Potter series (see page 85 for his quip about wizards being bussed to boarding school) which is utterly in keeping with his character.  And though this book wasn't overflowing with strong female characters, they exist.  I suspect we'll be seeing far more of them in the future books in the series than we have thus far.  Call it a hunch.<br />Currently this book stands at 462 pages.  A hefty read, but nothing a fascinated kid won't be able to handle.  I recently wrote in my review of \\"Mortal Engines\\" (highly recommend it, by the way) that that book was the true successor to Harry Potter.  I may have to extend that compliment to the \\"Bartimaeus Trilogy\\".  Droll and fast-paced without ever growing tiresome or annoying, this is one of the best dern books to be placed in the hands of fantasy-loving kids in a while.

689447:US	49148452	R25AQ4JJD23W62	1929766556	857491176	The Story of Little Black Sambo	Books	4	52	56	N	N	They do not want it Sam I am	Well, it raises enough issues to keep literary scholars blabbing on for years and years.  Following in the mighty footsteps of two other recent \\"Little Black Sambo\\" adaptations (one Fred Marcellino's \\"The Story of Little Babaji\\" and the other Julius Lester's complete reinterpretation \\"Sam and the Tigers\\") Christopher Bing's version of Helen Bannerman's original 1899 children's book is perhaps the purest retelling of the tale.  Using the author's own words while replacing her pictures with beautiful woodcut-like illustrations, the story is a true labor of love.<br />Where to begin?  When Helen Bannerman first wrote the story of Sambo for her children, she had no idea that her Beatrix Potter-like invention (both women began publishing children's books in similar ways) would be the source of so much controversy and contempt.  So let's say that we're a child that has stumbled across this edition without knowing a thing about its history.  To them, this is a gorgeous story filled with light and color and a young boy beating those more powerful around him.  The book has stayed true to the original in that it is set in India but features black characters.  So there's some danger that kids will believe some Africans live in an India-like country.  Otherwise, there's not much fault (in terms of the book in and of itself) to find with this retelling.  Bing has obviously spent an inordinate amount of time researching and questioning his creation.  We shouldn't ignore the fact that the great Henry Louis Gates Jr. (the Chair of Afro-American Studies at Harvard, doncha know) not only approved of this work but encouraged its publication.  So for me, it's a success (though I'm a little leery of the Bing picture on the bookflap presenting him as a colonist).<br />For some people, however, the very names of the characters (Sambo, Mumbo, and Jumbo) combined with the history of the tale are reason enough not to approve of this book.  To them, a story like this can only make it seem \\"okay\\" that children be called Sambo.  For others, the true crime of the original was not the story (in which a black boy outwits nasty predators) but the pictures.  Remove the offending articles and replace with far better ones and the problem is completely solved.  For me, I dunno.  There's little doubt in my mind that Bing's book is breathtakingly beautiful.  But every adult I've showed it to so far has been unable to get past the title.  I would show them the gorgeous endpapers and faux aged binding (meant, I can only assume, to recreate the book as it SHOULD have appeared those one hundred odd years ago).  I would patiently explain that Ms. Bannerman did not intend the story character, Sambo, to be associated with blacks in the United States.  But even today the sting of that name is as powerful as ever.  It may take one hundred or two hundred more years to undo some of its damage.  Maybe at that point people will be able to read this particular edition for what it truly is.  A loving work of beauty and skill.  If you've any problems with the idea of making \\"Little Black Sambo\\" palatable to members of the 21st century, do not buy this book.

I know the Baudelaire siblings weren't very happy when they found themselves in the clutches of Count Olaf in their first adventure.  And it cannot have been pleasant to find good old Uncle Monty dead in the second.  And certainly there was a lot of danger and difficulty in sailing across a leech filled lake in the third.  But to find themselves essentially child slaves working in a mill (and paid with coupons) for an employer whose name they don't even know... well that's just plain awful.<br />Things look pretty bleak for the Baudelaires this time, but they are determined to keep fighting.  In \\"The Miserable Mill\\", Snicket draws the undeniable differences between keeping one's chin up while accepting one's own problems and being an incurable optimist.  The Baudelaires meet an optimist in a fellow worker at the mill, and somehow the man's cheery euphemisms miraculously do not send the kids over the edge.  Then there's Count Olaf to deal with.  Dressed in his silliest disguise yet (and that's saying something) the Count is determined to use everything from hypnotism (all thanks to the help of the wonderfully monikered Dr. Orwell) to death by saw mill itself to get the orphans and their money.  In the end the children succeed, though I was somewhat confused by their wish to remain at the miserable mill.  Certainly they did not have fun there, but who am I to say?  In any case, the book is a delightful addition to the Series of Unfortunate Events.  One can only hope their next home will be a little more enjoyable (though the likelihood of that is....).	2004-04-27

Books	5	18	19	N	N	Here I come to save the day	Described in its day as attaining, \\"a fluidity rare in the medium\\", this illustrated book of woodcuts tells a simple fable that has remained beloved for decades.  Claiming to be a tale told from ancient India, the story follows a man, a mouse, and the downfall of pride.  A wise hermit lives alone in the forest when he happens to spy a mouse about to be eaten.  Fearful for the little creature, the man changes his new friend into a cat.  When a dog threatens his cat, he turns the mouse into a dog, and then (after a similar situation) into a tiger.  Now a fine feline of a beast, the former mouse lords his newfound state over the other animals of the forest.  After planning the death of his benefactor, the man changes the tiger into a mouse again and everything goes back to as it was (with the mouse, I suspect, a little wiser).<br />The woodcuts are fine indeed.  Delicate little illustrations imbued with life and verve.  From snarling dogs to transformed mice the images stand for themselves.  I hadn't been aware of the author/illustrator's work before reading her winning, \\"Stone Soup\\".  After comparing the two, I have to say they're definitely of equal interest.  It's nice to see a book giving a clear sighted look at a fable from another country (in this case, India) without any stereotypes or racism.  All in all, it's a nice little book with a strong moral core.	2004-04-27

It has everything a classic folktale should have and it tells its story with a coy courteous eloquence.  Few picture books are half as classy as \\"Strega Nona\\".  It is perhaps the world's best.<br />Strega Nona lives by her lonesome in a small cottage in Calabria, Italy.  A witch by trade, she cures the townspeople of their ailments, warts, and headaches.  When Big Anthony is hired on as Strega Nona's servant she gives him very strict instructions on what he is required to do, and what he is forbidden to do.  Quoth Strega Nona, \\"The one thing you must never do is touch the pasta pot\\".  You can probably guess where this is headed.  After seeing the witch conjure delicious cooked pasta fully formed from the pot, Anthony is eager to prove this miracle to the people of the town.  When Strega Nona leaves on a trip, Anthony speaks her spell and feeds everyone in the vicinity delicious piping hot pasta.  Unfortunately, Anthony didn't quite catch the way to make the pasta stop flowing.  As the villagers attempt to prevent the growing pasta from destroying their town, Strega Nona arrives just in time to put everything right again.  Anthony receives a just comeuppance and all is well in the world.<br />I can't pinpoint what exactly it is about this book that touches me so deeply.  Maybe it's the imagery in the illustrations.  Strega Nona has a prominent recognizable nose and a babuska's kerchief on her head.  She is constantly surrounded by large rabbits and peacocks, setting the tone of the life she leads.  Tomie de Paola's illustrations always contain an element of spirituality in them, and in this case it comes in the form of the priest and nuns living in the town.  I also am greatly attached to the book's choice of words.  There's not a syllable out of place in this tale.  Not a wasted consonant or a superfluous adjective.

Little did I know then that the adept writer would pop up later in my life with the book, \\"The Holy Twins\\".  Examining the lives of St. Benedict and Scholastica from childhood to their deaths, the book is a careful examination of the path to spiritual enlightenment.  To me, this book falls firmly into the category of picture-books-for-adults.  The book is a spiritual journey, one that could easily bore children but that contains enough life and verve within its pages to retain interest amongst the older crowd.  Illustrated by Tomie de Paola, the book is also bound to garner some interest amongst the \\"Strega Nona\\" fans as well.<br />The story follows the twins, Benedict and Scholastica.  As children they played together in the hills of northern Italy.  As time passed, however, they were separated and went their different ways.  Scholastica joined a convent and Benedict studied, eventually becoming a holy man of sorts.  The book mostly examines Benedict and his life, from one near poisoning to another.  When the siblings are united their personalities haven't changed much since their days as children and they still react to one another similarly.  In the end, Scholastica is the first to pass away and Benedict decrees that he be buried with his twin when he too dies.  An author's note at the end (also accompanied by de Paola's illustrations) explains the rule of St. Benedict and gives some additional information about how Benedict influenced monasteries for centuries to come.<br />As I mentioned before, I personally can't see the little ones put to bed with this as their bedtime story.  Certainly the words are simple enough but there's a sophistication to the plot and language that suits an adult reader better.  That and the fact that not a whole lot happens in this tale.  The book's exceeding interest in Benedict who, as the book itself notes was, \\"extremely strict and demanding of the monks\\", and others, is baffling.  Why not give us more of a glance on the life of Scholastica?  This character obviously has a sense of humor but one minute she's a girl entering a convent and the next she's greeting her grey-haired twin brother.  Why the lapse?  Benedict's preferential treatment belies the title of the book that would have suggested the tale told the stories of both the characters.  Alas that this is not the case.<br />No objection could possibly ever be made to de Paola's illustrations, by the way.  He is just as talented today as he was when he first began illustrating.  The use of distance and multiple actions taking place on a single page is impressive.  All in all, the tale is given a respect and dignity that a lesser illustrator might have squandered.  Such is the beauty of a de Paola book.<br />Should you wish to teach the tale of two saints from birth to death, this is a good resource to have. But for fun recreational reading, I direct you to look elsewhere.  It's a great book, but dry at times and skimpy on the details at others.

These days the classic tale of how to make stone soup has been told in a myriad of different tellings and versions.  But if you harken back a little to Marci Brown's 1947 concoction, you see clearly that the story can be a little more sardonic than its alternate versions.  In this tale, villagers are tricked out of their greed and fear into sharing and enjoying life with their neighbors.  And it's all thanks to a soup that doesn't even exist.<br />Three soldiers make their way home from an unnamed war in an unnamed country.  Passing a village, the men ask the townspeople for some food and warm beds.  Unsurprisingly, the peasants (who, one presumes, have been violently scared into this state of distrust through years of misuse at the hands of soldiers such as these) feign a lack of food or room for the men.  Thinking on their feet, the soldiers proclaim that there is nothing for it then but to make stone soup.  The astonished town watches and aids the men in their task, providing them with a huge soup cauldron, water, and whatever ingredients the soldiers casually mention.  By the end of the evening everyone sits down to a hearty meal and after a good night of carousing the men are given the best beds in town.  \\"And fancy, made from stones!\\"<br /><br />The soldiers in this tale are jovial fellows, just as comfortable fooling foolish peasants into acts of selflessness as they are dancing with pretty maids and drinking.  That so much joy can come simply from sharing with your fellow man is a moral insinuated from the tale, rather than explicitly spelled out to the reader.  Brown's accompanying illustrations encompass roughly four colors; red, black, white, and grey.  Though a subtle palette, the figures readily express all the emotions, fears, and energy of the people and their soldier guests.  I was charmed by the final throwaway line in the book, written below the peasants as they wave goodbye to the three men.  \\"Such men don't grow on every bush\\".

This books wins the award for Subtlest-Book-About-Diversity for 1963.  It is wholly and entirely charming.  Swimmy is the only little fish amongst his brothers and sisters who was born black instead of red.  A faster fish than all of them, Swimmy has the mixed blessing of being able to out swim a big fish that has come to devour his family.  Poor Swimmy is left all alone in the world, but his sadness doesn't last for very long.  The undersea world is full of wonders, including medusas made of rainbow jelly, a forest of seaweeds growing from sugar candy rocks, and sea anemones that look like, \\"pink palm trees swaying in the wind\\".  When Swimmy stumbles across another group of small red fish, his quick thinking helps them to band together to fight the larger fish in the sea.<br />For any kid that loved \\"Finding Nemo\\", I think this book would be an excellent companion.  The lesson is twofold.  One is that when people band together they can fight the unnaturally large problems facing them.  Another is that being different, like Swimmy, can be a wonderful thing.  I'm sure you're going to read reviews from people decrying this book as Communist propaganda (after all, it's a bunch of red fish finding strength in numbers to defeat the more powerful members of society that were previously eating them), and that's fine.  It could definitely be read that way, and there's nothing wrong with that.  But for those of you who feel that the book was probably meant to be read as a story for children and that's that, you're undoubtedly more correct.<br />Leo Lionni is a magnificent artist, by the way.  No one draws jellyfish with as much light and airy oomph as he does.  The sea's wonders are all alight here, with little black Swimmy eyeing each and every one.  There's a beauty to these watercolors that is difficult to find anywhere else.  Even today, with our high tech picture book wizardry and computer generated images, nothing looks as pleasing to the eye as Lionni's tendrils of swaying anemones.

Continuing where, \\"The White Mountains\\" left off, the book follows the adventures of Will and his fight against the Tripods and their alien masters.  The book furthers our knowledge about the invaders of Earth and their personal lives.  Will and a fellow uncapped boy are given the chance to enter into the home of the Tripods.  Once there, Will finds himself a slave to one of the aliens that live in the city and his companionship with this creature leads to further knowledge.  This book also marks the point at which Will learns of the aliens' final solution (referred to here as The Plan) for earth's original inhabitants.<br /><br />I found myself enjoying this book far more than \\"The White Mountains\\" itself.  Though the first book in the series was far more action packed and filled with gripping chase and escape sequences, the second book is filled with fascinating descriptions of the Masters and their alien lifestyle.  This is the kind of book we've been waiting for.  Who are these creatures that fit every human with a silver mesh of a cap, making them docile and compliant?  Where are they from?  How extensive is their knowledge?  And, most importantly, how can they be beaten?<br /><br />Christopher has inserted a clever handicap into this tale that keeps Will from doing anything rash or careless.  Neither Will nor his fellow uncapped slave can reveal their true intentions.  From the moment they enter the city of gold and lead (so nicknamed for its design and intense gravity) to the moment they are supposed to leave, our heroes mustn't reveal to the Masters that they are uncapped or that a resistance has been planned.  The writing in this tale never lingers unduly and the narrative is crisp and swift.  Even reluctant readers will breeze through this tale, stopping to marvel at the amazing world the author has created within the boundaries of the city.<br /><br />I'll admit it right now.  Until this book I never really noticed the similarities between this series and H.G. Wells' remarkable \\"War of the Worlds\\".  Certainly both stories rely on the world being conquered by huge tripods from outer space.  In both cases, the aliens responsible for earth's enslavement are unwilling to consider human beings' rights.  But the final similarity, and the most striking, is the physical resemblance between the aliens found here in \\"City of Gold and Lead\\" and the Wells classic.  Both books contain aliens that have tentacles and can't breathe Earth's air.  Has Christopher stolen his ideas and made them palatable to children?  Perhaps.  If so, I've no real objection to his strategy.  Slightly more infuriating is his continued dismissal of women in general.  If there are female aliens, we're never told of them.  As for the girls sent, like the boys, to the city to work as slaves for the Masters, they are quickly dispatched.  Apparently Christopher reasoned that while men can handle physical labor and pain, girls cannot.  As such, women are killed and the most beautiful amongst them are placed in glass display cases to be observed.  Forget trying to search for any symbolism here.  It's obvious that the aliens, in addition to being wholly male, are just as sexist as their human counterpoints.  While the first book in the Tripod series had a few weak willed females here and there, this book hasn't a single living woman in it AT ALL.  This is fairly weird, even for a boy's adventure novel.  So on a level of one to five (one being the least chauvinist and five being the most) I'd place this book squarely at 4.7.<br />Otherwise, I've no objections at all.  The book is well paced, well written, and well thought out.  All in all, a delightful read that makes one even more eager to read the final chapter in the trilogy.<BR>I'll admit it right now.

A story that begins by uttering factual possibilities (as science fiction does) will not fare well in the face of fantastical elements.  And then you read a miraculous story like, \\"Enchantress From the Stars\\" and it all goes higgledy-piddledy out the window. Sylvia Louise Engdahl's 1970 classic isn't just well written.  It is also a deeply moving work that seeks to answer questions we may have about our own innate morality and future prospects.<br />In this story we meet our heroine Alana.  Alana spells out clearly the three phases of humanity.  In the first phase, people are superstitious and primitive.  In the second, they are scientific and logical.  In the third (and this is the phase to which Alana belongs) people remember the spiritual side to life and enter onto an entirely different plane from that of their forebears.  Those planets and people in the universe who have advanced to the third phase have joined together to save those in the first phase from those in the second.  In this particular story, Alana joins both her father and her lover on a planet not too different from that of Earth.  Their goal is to save the planet's fledgling civilization from a group of colonizers from another planet.  To do so, Alana must enlist the help of a man living in an age of chivalry and a man living in an age of science.  As these three worlds intersect, the book thoroughly examines where it is humanity is heading and what we have to look forward to.  In short, it is a book about faith.<br />How easy it would have been for author Engdahl to screw up while writing this.  She could have made it too long (and it's not a quick read at that).  The pace could have dragged.  The characters (and jumps between different people's perspectives) could have rung false.  Instead, the book is nearly perfect.  Alana has sworn an oath to protect the secret of her advanced world's existence from the people she interacts with.  At the same time, however, she wonders if it is proper to question the oath's policy.  When she asks her father this question he responds as such:<br />\\"We are sworn to carry out Federation policy, yes, just as a policeman is bound to uphold the law; but that doesn't mean we suspend our own ethical judgement\\".<br />So Engdahl smoothly works in questions of ethics vs. morality as well.  The book goes far beyond the normal sci-fi/fantasy literature it has been so unfortunately paired with.  Rather, it is a deeply moving and deeply felt story that reaches for the Big Questions and, on top of that, is an enjoyable read.

I love Robert Lawson and I love Munroe Leaf, but ladies and gentlemen these two men are definitely less great unless paired together.  In undoubtedly my favorite children's book from the 1930s (so sorry, \\"They Were Strong and Brave\\"), these two titans of the picture book world created the most adorable story to have ever involved cork trees, bulls, and sweet smelling flowers.<br />Ferdinand is none too different from \\"The Reluctant Dragon\\".  He may look fierce and strong, but underneath that hard exterior lies a bull that is perfectly content to just sit beneath his favorite cork tree and smell the flowers all day.  Ferdinand was gentle even when young, and he has no desire to go needlessly ramming his head with the other bulls in the field.  When some wonderfully illustrated men arrive to find a bull worthy of their bull-fighting arena, Ferdinand is accidentally selected as their choice.  Once in the arena, however, Ferdinand proceeds to humiliate the matador and his cronies through simple peace-loving flower-smelling.  In the end, Ferdinand is returned to his cork tree and the world is as it was.<br />There's a definite pacifist feel behind the old Ferdinand tale.  In what other story will you have a creature not fight back despite all provocations, only to win in the end?  Moreover, a male character that prefers pretty sights and smells to violence and uber-masculinity.  Lawson's pen and ink drawings expertly compliment Leaf's tale.  Through them we see the high balconies of Spanish towns, and the serene fields where little bulls may play.  I was especially amused by the cork tree, from which actual wine corks hang.  I suspect many a child has subsequently believed for years that corks really do grow on the vine as Lawson displayed them.  Lawson isn't above other humorous tweaking beyond that.  On the front and end papers of the book is an image of children gawking at a ferocious picture of \\"angry\\" Ferdinand.  The poster goes on to advertise treats at the bull fight including \\"hot dogos\\" and \\"chocolato\\".  Apparently any word with an appropriate \\"o\\" tacked on the end is instantly Spanish.<br />\\"Ferdinand\\" is the sweetest of the Leaf/Lawson tales.  However you feel about the nature of violence (and about how it is almost required of the males of society) this is the quintessential story about being yourself.  The angry over-masculine bulls may fight and brawl but peaceful Ferdinand is the one to outwit the men in the end.ght including \\"hot dogos\\" and \\"chocolato\\".

Where else are you going to locate a loving family story that contains a nose-pierced tattooed mom and a earring sporting side-burn shaved pop?  Maybe there are plenty out there, but how many are good?  Author/illustrator Bob Graham has penned a touching tale of a girl's wish for a dog of her own.<br />Kate hasn't had a pet since her cat died.  Enthused one morning she leaps into her parents' bedroom proclaiming the need to get a pup tout suite.  Her parents, a grungy amiable crew, agree immediately and it's off to the nearest pet shelter.  Once there, they immediately locate a cute lively puppy that meets all their needs.  But on the way out a big old dog named Rosie captures their hearts as well and it is with a sad heart that they leave without her.  By the end, however, everything has worked out for the best and now the two dog family can get back to normal.<br />This is just a great book.  Apart from the enthusiastic and enjoyable illustrations, there's a real sense of \\"home\\" to this story.  This is one of those rare picture books where you feel you could really walk into this house and feel it was a real place.  There's clutter and mess, but nothing more than you'd find in your average house with a kid.  The dad makes lame jokes, the mom wears burkes and has the odd pantyhoe sticking out of her dresser drawer.  And Kate, the kid, is just your usual ragamuffin urchin, hankering for a pet or two to sleep with her at night.  I don't know why, but I really felt this story took place in Seattle too.  Something about the people and the views of the town from their front door.  And the story's just great.  It's all about loving dogs regardless of age.  About making a home out of different kinds of people and creatures.  It's a book about family in the best of ways.<br /> Here's the last two sentences in the book:<br />\\"It seems like Dave and Rosy have always been there. Their weight is comfortable and reliable, and will stop Kate's bed from floating away into the night\\".<br />When it comes down to it, \\"Let's Get a Pup!, Said Kate\\" is just a joy to read.  Those parents who are uncomfortable with families that are a little different will undoubtedly dislike this book.  For anyone with an open mind and a big heart, this is a wonderful tale.bed from floating away into the night\\".<br />When it comes down to it, \\"Let's Get a Pup!, Said Kate\\" is just a joy to read.

For those of you who have never met the charming Olivia, this is probably the best book to begin with.  Less pretentious than its sequels, in it you meet Olivia, her family, and her penchant for extravagant imaginings.  Drawn in beautifully shaded black and white, this particular tale is dotted with brilliant flashes of Olivia's red belongings.  Her adventures are quite tame.  Following the day to day adventures of an average child, the viewer views Olivia going to the beach, into her closet, to the museum, and at last to bed.<br />Reviewer Dwight Garner recently noted in his New York Times Book Review that, \\" `Olivia' is one of those kids' books... that hip mommies and daddies like to give to the children of other hip mommies and daddies in order to demonstrate, yet again, what delightfully hip mommies and daddies we all are\\".  There's no denying that this book is decidedly hip.  I've yet to see a mom in a children's book look as particularly metropolitan (read: New Yorkish) as Olivia's black clad momma.  And when Olivia creates a castle, she doesn't go halfway.  She creates a sand-skyscraper.  Mr. Garner does bring up an interesting point, though.  Is \\"Olivia\\" something kids actually love and hold dear to their hearts, or is it something that parents love and hope their kids will get into?  Who doesn't want their children to be inspired by a character that reads about Maria Callas before she goes to bed?<br />I don't know how kids feel about the story.  But what I do know is that it's a quality piece of work.  The art is beautiful.  The story sublime.  Plus it's a riot.  Olivia stuffed into one of the legs of her mother's pantyhose is a black and white joke hidden in the corner of a colorful montage of Olivia wearing her full wardrobe (love the ballgown).<br />\\"Olivia\\" is not going to change the world of children's book publishing.  And perhaps it's only ever going to be fully appreciated by people over the age of 18.  But with all the crummy two-bit picture books out there (\\"Love You Forever\\" anyone?) sometimes it's just a small slice of heaven to read something to your child that's enjoyable to them and fun for you as well.e ballgown).  <br />\\"Olivia\\" is not going to change the world of children's book publishing.

The story was not long or drawn out, and the words in the books were simple and pure.  You might expect that in a picture book anyway, but there's a difference between saying what you want clearly and directly and simply being brief.  Rylant never says any more nor less than she has to.  It's a talent that has served her well in the past and made possible the succinct eloquence that is, \\"God Went to Beauty School\\".<br />I don't know if this book is profane or the holiest collection of poems I've ever read.  I think maybe it's a little of both.  Unabashedly Christian (with nods of the head to Buddhism) the book is a series sweet simple views of how God goes about His day.  23 poems in all, the book shows God getting a dog, ordering a couch from Pottery Barn, seeing a movie, and so on.  These are small vignettes that take a what-if stance and enjoy what they conjure up.  The great danger of the book, I suppose, was that it might fall into that old, \\"What If God Was One of Us\\", trap.  Some could argue that this book is unnecessary if you believe that Jesus was already God.  Rylant anticipates this point in the final longest poem, \\"God Died\\".<br /><br />The book is simultaneously funny and touching.  I have heard that Bible study groups use the poems to study.  That groups of people without religion will ponder the poems line by line.  The nicest poem in the group is, to my mind, \\"God Went to India\\".  I have heard that people have read this poem at funerals.  That it encompasses something in all of us, touching us deeply, revealing the truth that everything changes from one thing into another.  The book is small and it does not impose itself upon you.  It invites you to read it and whether you love it or hate it, it will not attempt to convert you one way or another.  It is a book to love.	2004-04-23
695342:US	49148452	R3QAM5DJOM92R5	0786805684	394193021	Ella Fitzgerald: The Tale of a Vocal Virtuosa	Books	4	20	20	N	N	Ella enchanted	You open this book and the endpapers swirl and glow like black painted silk.  They're the first indication you receive that this book is something special.  Something different.  Something apart from the rest.  Using the narrating character of one Scat Cat Monroe, an actual well-dressed feline, the story follows Ella from child to lady of the stage.  As we watch, Ella moves to Harlem thinking she's gonna make it big through dancing.  Once there, however, she switches her focus and unleashes her fabulous voice.  She pairs up with the Chick Webb Orchestra and Al Feldman.  She then bebops with Dizzy Gillespie and earns herself the name \\"The Queen of Scat\\".  It's a fabulous upbeat tale that takes the spirit of Ella Fitzgerald and lets her shine.  The best possible tribute to her name.<br />The text of the story is especially amusing.  Sometimes a book will attempt to speak in a jiving slangy sort of way and simply come off as annoying.  Other times, the author sounds as if he/she is trying too hard.  Fortunately, Andrea Davis Pinkney has everything under control so that when the book says something like, \\"She won the contest straight up, kicked her dance dreams to the curb, and pinned all her hopes on being a singer\\", you know it's true.  There's a poetry to this book's speech that never crosses the line from authentic to agonizing.  Instead, it's got a rhythm all its own.<br />Accompanying Andrea's text are Brian Pinkney's illustrations.  At first I was a little put off by the amount of magical realism evident in its pages.  Then I read Brian's inspirations (William H. Johnson, Aaron Douglas, the Art Deco movement, etc.) and it all made sense.  And there's no arguing that the pictures here are fan-freakin'-tastic.  Brian Pinkey has used scratchboard to make these images as bright and free flowing as they are.  The result looks like nothing so much as woodcuts on acid.  There's breath and movement to these pictures, and Ella herself has been granted the power of appearing larger than life.<br />If I've any objections to this book, maybe it comes with the choice of creating Scat Cat Monroe.  Do we really need an anthropomorphic cat to lure children into this story?  But it's a small complaint.  Andrea Pinkney is kind enough to supply a biography, bibliography, videography, and selected discography at the end of the book for future reference.  Always a nice touch.  The Pinkney duo have truly created one of the best picture books encompassing the jazz, scat, and bebop movements of the past.

Making use of every bookflap, endpaper, table of contents, flyleaf, and ISBN box, Jon Scieszka (go on...pronounce it) and Lane Smith teamed up to bring us the picture book that gives kids a lot more credit than most.  Many adults will sit their little ones down with the same boring fairy tales with the same boring fairy tale lessons.  Kids like fairy tales, no question, but kids also love the subversive.  So if you hand them a book like, \\"The Stinky Cheese Man\\", that undermines everything fairy tales stand for, the children will fall on their knees in praise.<br />The book is a madcap collection of dismembered tales and stories.  Didn't much care for the ending of the original \\"Ugly Duckling\\"?  Well here's your chance to see the real (and realistic) finale to the tale.  Think \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" could be pepped up a bit by calling it, \\"Little Red Running Shorts\\"?  Go wild.  Scieszka is one of those rare authors that know exactly how to get little kids in stitches without resorting to the usual scatological humor and innuendo.  This book is one wild ride.  Characters frequently break through the fourth wall to confront the reader directly.  There's a mixing and melding to the book, sometimes ending with the untimely demise of boring or annoying characters.  I think it is safe to say that prior to reading this story, I had never had the pleasure of watching Foxy Loxy get pummeled by a book's Table of Contents.  So thank you, Mr. Scieszka.<br />But thanking Scieszka without tipping one's hat to Lane Smith is like feeding bananas to buffalos.  It just doesn't make sense.  Smith is every bit up to the task of matching Scieszka feather to feather and foul to foul on this intrepid fairy tale adventure.  Characters appearing in this book look like nothing so much as a nightmare of texts, fabrics, and shapes.  Lane has always reminded me of graphic novelist Dave McKean (of \\"The Wolves in the Walls\\" fame), but with a few more childlike sensibilities.  These pictures are meant to disturb, but not scare.  Rather than finding Lane's grotesqueries fierce, children are endlessly amused by them.  And to be frank, so am I.  They're great.  This book, is great.  And the experience of reading it is nothing but a fan-freakin'-tastic experience.meant to disturb, but not scare.

Such a move might be enough to worry any child, but Amada feels alone in her fear and worry.  Her brothers, after all, don't seem to find anything problematic with the plan, and her parents are as prepared as they can be.  Packing up and moving in with their relatives until their green cards come through, Amada's father searches for work and she writes her adventures in her diary.  The book tells her story both in Spanish and in English, making it the perfect way to introduce a multitude of people to a single text.<br />Author Amada Irma Perez has based this tale on her own experiences growing up.  Like the protagonist she moved to America when she was a young girl, and the trip and relocation ultimately made her a stronger person.  Perez is to be commended for this story.  Because this is a children's book, it cannot directly tackle the worst aspects of immigrant life.  Instead, it gently alludes to the myriad of problems awaiting the newest American citizens.<br />The book has many wonderful aspects, but there are a few inconsistencies I had trouble getting past.  At one moment, Amada receives a letter from her father who is toiling in the fields of California.  He says that a man named Cesar Chavez is there and that perhaps good unions will form.  I love Cesar Chavez and I feel he was one of the great American heroes, but suddenly the text jars horribly with the illustrations.  Up until this point, this book could have taken place today in this day and age.  After all, what female child in the 1950s wore jeans all the time or, for that matter, flip flops?  It's as if the illustrator decided that this book was going to be contemporary, Cesar Chavez reference or no Cesar Chavez reference.  It's a blemish on what is otherwise a very well put together book.<br />Despite the Chavez allusion, I would recommend this book as a look on the current Mexican immigrant life and lifestyle.  A great story for those kids who read English, and those that read Spanish.  Anyone who peruses this story will instantly connect with the characters and their plight, making this a tale that needs to be told to little ones again and again and again.ids who read English, and those that read Spanish.

Not too long ago I had the great delight in reading Ilse Plume's enjoyable, \\"The Christmas Witch\\".  The story is an Italian legend about a woman that serves as a sort of Santa Claus for the children of Italy.  A lovely book.  Can't recommend it enough.  Anywho, I read and reviewed that puppy and then set about reading some more Caldecott winning picture books.  Imagine my surprise when I discovered \\"Baboushka and the Three Kings\\".  To my amazement, here was the same story.  Oh, a little different here and there.  Now we are in Russia rather than Italy (those Wise Men certainly got around!) but the story is essentially the same.  As a woman who went for 26 years of her life without hearing this story once, I was more than a little shocked to realize how prevalent it is around the world.  It just falls into the category of being one of those stories they simply do not teach you in school.<br />Baboushka lives on her own in a small house in Russia.  One day, the Three Wise Men arrive with a huge procession of (what look to be) armed guards.  The three knock on Baboushka's door and ask her to accompany them on their quest to find the Christ Child.  Baboushka still has some chores to finish up so the men proceed onward without her.  Filled with a desire to see this miracle, however, she fills a bag with presents and sets out to find the babe.  Unfortunately, the time has passed and Baboushka cannot locate either kings nor child.  It is said, therefore, that every year around Christmastime Baboushka renews her search, leaving presents for other children along the way.<br />The book itself is small and drawn in a peculiar blocky style.  I was reminded of nothing so much as Mondrian's paintings while reading.  Artist Nicolas Sijakov had a way of drawing that was uniquely his own, and the book compliments that.  Whether he is displaying small wooden villages or grand spires and towers, nothing but Baboushka is in color.  I was particularly taken with the section where Baboushka is left standing in the doorway of her home as the kingly procession leaves to follow the star.  Here we have a small red dot watching forlornly as a line of multicolored dots leave her behind to tramp into the blue snowy wilderness.  The story is a little sad, leaving Baboushka forever on her impossible quest, and in a way I preferred \\"The Christmas Witch\\"'s more upbeat ending.  Just the same, it's a great tale to tell around Christmastime.  If you would like to inform children of the myriad of different Santa-claus like tales out there, this Caldecott winning story wouldn't be a bad place to begin.lor.

Unprecedented.  Here, at last, was a picture book in which the protagonist is black.  It's not an overtly political book, mind you.  Just a nice story about a kid in the city playing in the snow.  Having heard about this story for a long time, I decided now was the moment to see how well this book has stood up over time.  Ezra Jack Keats has long passed from idle picture book author to a somewhat god-like figure of the children's book world, so does this early work stand out even today?  If it was introduced for the first time now, would it be considered as good as it is?  Yes and no.  The book is both a fabulous creation, and a very simple, very normal, tale that everyone on one level or another is familiar with.<br />In this book, Peter wakes up to discover that snow has covered the city in the night.  Delighted, he pulls on his bright red (and now world known) snowsuit and plunges into a day of exploring and playing.  He makes fun tracks, and hits snow off the branches of trees.  He constructs a smiling snowman and slides down steep mountains of snow.  At the end of the day his mother gets him out of his wet clothes and gives him a nice hot bath.  The next morning the snow is still there, and an ecstatic Peter calls up a friend to do the whole day over again.<br />When I was a child I loved (and still do) stories that took place in the big cities.  Keats never draws an inordinate amount of attention to Peter's surroundings.  So while you won't see skyscrapers or taxi cabs, there's a distinctly urban feel to the lay of the land.  The text is nice and easy for the youngsters to understand.  As for the cut-outs, they're a delight to look at.  Picture books featuring cut-outs may be remembered best as belonging to such artists as Eric Carle or Leo Lionni, but I consider Mr. Keats to be the granddaddy of the art form.  Aside from the beauty of the landscaping in this pictures, I loved the papers used in the book.  The section in which Peter sits on the snow, a snowball embedded on his chest, the black sky is a-swirl in greens, blues, and browns.  When Peter slides down a snow covered embankment, the sky is then a delightful twisty series of white smoke-like curlicues.  And Peter's home itself is eloquently rendered.  From the wrought iron bed frame to the multicolored wallpaper and tiles that enhance the setting, the book is the best possible combination of elegance and realism.<br />If it came out today, \\"Snowy Day\\" wouldn't garner an overly enthusiastic response from publishers and critics.  Which isn't to say that it's unworthy of the praise already received.  As I've tried to show, the book is a wonderful amalgamation of text, pattern, and emotion.

I sort of lump Jerry Spinelli and Kate DiCamillo into the same category.  Though Spinelli has always been more prolific than DiCamillo (partly because he's been working longer), both authors create similar upbeat-but-acknowledge-the-world's-problems type children's books.  And people love Spinelli and DiCamillo.  Love them because they want to feel that these books really capture the unattainable good within the bad that is so very hard to write about.  Personally, I'm not a huge fan of DiCamillo, and Spinelli's \\"Stargirl\\" left me kinda cold.  So I picked up \\"Maniac Magee\\" with a kind of vain hope.  Maybe this book would be better than I'd expected.  Maybe it wouldn't drown the darker elements of life and society in the ooey-gooey syrup of a \\"Full House\\" episode.  Maybe, in fact, this would be a great book.  And you know what?  It kind of is.<br />This is a tall tale.  The awesome story of Maniac Magee.  He was the fastest, smartest, coolest kid you'd ever meet.  He could untie any knot you handed him, and outrun anyone you could name.  He was tough and funny and never went to school.  He was a living legend in his day and was colorblind as they come.  When Maniac Magee moves into the black side of town, his appearance there and subsequent actions trip off a series of events that lead, if not to greater understanding between townspeople, then to a lessening of prejudices.<br />This is what I liked about \\"Maniac Magee\\".  I liked that this book didn't end with Maniac ala Keesha Knight Pullman in \\"Polly\\" destroying the barriers between the white side and the black side of town single-handedly.  I liked that he didn't destroy racism itself and that the ending of the book, rather than clearing up the town's problems, cleared up Maniac's problems.  I liked that he had problems in the first place and that though he was an extraordinary human being, he made mistakes.  I liked Mars Bar Thompson, a boy that is, in a way, a tall tale of his own and Maniac's worthy rival.  I liked all these things, and more.  I liked the story itself.  It knew where to draw the line, how much to say, and how much to leave unsaid.<br />This is what I didn't like about \\"Maniac Magee\\".  I didn't like that the book never really explained why the blacks hated the whites so much.  Once in a while a black character would get angry at Maniac's appearance on the wrong side of town and yell at him things like, \\"Never enough, is it, Whitey?  Just want more and more.  Won't even leave us our little water in the street\\".  The man who says these things to Maniac has obviously suffered heartily at the hands of whites in the past, but Spinelli paints the character as more of a crazy aberration representing a minority opinion.  He doesn't explain WHY the African Americans wouldn't want a white person amongst them, and kids reading this might just think the guy was mean or unbalanced.  To read this book is to already understand the underpinnings of racism.  Otherwise, you might get a little bent out of shape reading a story in which a white kid beats a black one so badly that the white kid is able to run backwards over the finish line, effectively humiliating his black opponent.<br />There are things to love and dislike about \\"Maniac Magee\\".  All in all, I found it fairly strong.  The tall tale aspect of the storytelling, the rhythmic rise and fall of the action and words, and the book's telling conclusion all make it a rather good piece of writing.  It's not as neatly tied up as much as it could be at the end, and that's just fine.

All in all, I found it fairly strong.  The tall tale aspect of the storytelling, the rhythmic rise and fall of the action and words, and the book's telling conclusion all make it a rather good piece of writing.  It's not as neatly tied up as much as it could be at the end, and that's just fine.  Though I might not have handed it a Newbery award, it's well worth perusing and deserves to be on every child's reading list for a long long time.	2004-04-22

Tuesday, Wednesday break my heart	We've all heard the stories of the skies, for whatever reason, raining frogs on innocent town travelers.  This natural occurrence of the wild is one of the great weirdnesses of life.  So how much odder is it, really, to consider frogs flying?  They have all the self-possession required of such a task.  Frogs are a uniquely calm species.  Confident even.  In Dave Wiesner's essentially wordless book \\"Tuesday\\", amphibian folk are given the unexplained power of floatation.  In his tale, Wiesner considers what exactly frogs would do with the gift of flying if it was granted them.<br />One of the best pictures in this book is on one of the first pages.  There, a turtle cowers into its shell as black eyed pupil-less frogs rise on their lily pads out of the water.  The frogs descend, so to speak, on a nearby suburb, and proceed to wreak some minor havok.  They disturb a man pausing to eat a late night sandwich.  They disturb laundry and enter old ladies' homes to watch a little telly.  And they take a great amount of pleasure in scaring a dog that would undoubtedly eat them if it had the chance.  As the book ends, the frogs are relieved of their otherworldly powers and hop back to the swamps, leaving only their lily pads behind them.  The next Tuesday, at the same time, we're given a hint of how a more porcine animal will handle flight.<br />Wiesner is a genius at the visual gag.  His illustrations are simple watercolors, well-detailed and in-depth.  Wiesner knows when to give an animal human expressions and when to leave it looking particularly froggy.  He gets every single one of those frogs' spots down , and can manipulate his illustrations in such a way that you never doubt for a moment the ridiculous things you're seeing.  To top it all off, the man's a master at conveying light.  I'm particularly attached to a scene of flying frogs watching t.v., a wary cat crouching in the background.  The old lady asleep in the chair is wearing glasses that are reflecting the light of the television perfectly.  On top of that, this is exactly what a room lit only by a single screen looks like.  Wiesner's details are marvelous.  Make sure to notice the frog appreciatively eyeing the old lady's painting of the forest.<br />There aren't that many wordless picture books out there these days though Wiesner has made a name for himself by specializing in this area.  After reading \\"Tuesday\\", you can understand why he deserves this honor.  Both witty and perverse, this author/illustrator lets you see into worlds you never could have imagined existed before he came up with them.

An unseen narrator (who we assume must be a child of some sort) narrates a tale of unprecedented zooish generosity.  After asking the zoo for a pet, a series of animals are sent in the hope that the child will want them.  Unfortunately (and as the book makes clear) many of animals one finds at the zoo are inappropriate pets.  Each animal that arrives is hidden beneath a flap.  When you lift the flap the children to whom you are reading this tale are supposed to delightedly cry out the name of that particular animal.  In this way, you can teach kids the kinds of animals that live at the zoo.  For the narrator, though, elephants are too big, lions too fierce, monkeys to naughty, and frogs too jumpy.  In the end, the narrator receives a small hamper with the note, \\"From all your friends at the zoo\\" containing the perfect pet.<br />As an early book, this story and its accompanying illustrations are very very simple.  I was a little disappointed at the flimsiness of the flaps children are supposed to lift or turn.  The copy I paged through had been scotch taped and re-scotch taped several times to keep the book in any kind of semblance of order.  It is also a pity that the animals in this book aren't named ever.  I don't doubt that kids will, mostly, be able to name them anyway, but it's nice to learn to read the names along with the pictures of the animals.  Still, the book is satisfying to read.  No subtext here.  Nuh-uh.  Just a very basic story about a zoo, some friendly animals, and the reasons (or lack there of) of keeping them.  For another interesting and enjoyable zoo book, try \\"Good Night, Gorilla\\" by Peggy Rathmann (a personal pet favorite of mine).	2004-04-21

Now our Baudelaire friends have been plunged into the depths of academia.  In effect, they are no longer being put into the perilous hands of pseudo (and increasingly dying) relatives.  Instead, they find themselves plunked into Prufrock Prep (motto Momento Mori).  Their Vice Principal Nero is just as insane as their last guardian, but at least his set of crazy rules aren't too terrible.  Though the Baudelaires do have to sleep in a dank, crab infested, fungus dripping shack, they're given enough to eat and new friends.  Enter the Quagmire Triplets (of which there are two).  Like the Baudelaires, their family died under mysterious fire related circumstances.  Such similarities don't end there, however.  The Quagmires also have a fortune awaiting them.  With these new friends, the Baudelaires face up to the newest evil scheme of Count Olaf and his ridiculous disguises.  This time, however, something goes terribly wrong.<br />You know what I'd like to see in the series?  I've only read five of these books thus far, and maybe this has already happened, but what I would really like to see someday is Count Olaf actually fool the Baudelaires with a disguise.  Wouldn't that be interesting?  But I suppose part of the point of the books is that Olaf really is a terrible terrible actor, despite his aspirations.  This particular book in the series is a welcome addition.  The first book established the plot, and the next three had a similar formula.  With \\"The Austere Academy\\" we get a whole new element thrown in.  The Quagmires are basically just as kind and intelligent as the Baudelaires, but with (ha ha) a little less luck.<br />I've come to view these books as a kind of updated \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" for our generation.  Like the Alice books, the Baudelaires are the only sane people in a world of half-crazed, maddened, and useless adults.  Unlike Alice, however, they've an evil Count on their trail, constantly attempting to get his oily paws on their fortune.  This is also the first book that I've noticed where Sunny begins using real words on a regular basis.  It just goes to show that though the formula may remain the same, the characters are growing in spite of their circumstances.  It bodes badly for the Baudelaires, and well for the series in general.his oily paws on their fortune.

Not only is this the first teen novel ever recognized as such, but it is also one of the first books publicized as, \\"About teen-agers, for teen-agers, by a teen-ager\\" (according to the original hardback's bookflap).  Written by a seventeen year-old girl, cleverly hiding her first name behind initials as so many female authors still do (paging J.K. Rowling).  The book is still taught today and has slowly graduated from a contemporary tale using new slang and terms to a historical view of kids living in an urban setting before the massive takeover of drugs and electronics.<br />In this book, the lines are clearly drawn.  You are either a Greaser or a Soc.  Socs are rich over-privileged kids (all white) given too much license and too little interest by their parents.  Hinton suggests that the only way they can \\"feel\\" is to fight the Greasers in the town.  Why anyone in their right mind would want to fight a Greaser is beyond me.  Greasers are the poor kids (all white) that live on the wrong side of the tracks.  Everyone's familiar with the stereotypical John Travolta in \\"Grease\\" type character.  They're harsh and mean but, as we see in this tale, they have good hearts every one.  Our hero is one Ponyboy Curtis.  Apparently 1967 was the last year you could be named \\"Ponyboy\\" and not get daily thrashings from your peers for having such a la-de-dah name.  With his crew of fellow Greasers and friends, Ponyboy's a great student and a nice guy.  When he gets involved in a game of murder by bad luck, he's finds himself on the run with fellow innocent wide-eyed Greaser Johnny.  From this experience the two learn what is really important, and Ponyboy finds the strength to tell the story of this friends and their lives.<br />The idea that this book was written by a seventeen year-old is still shocking to me. There's a real maturity to the text, no question.  Sure, some ideas are pounded into the reader over and over until you're completely sick of them.  But the characters really do exhibit a sense of affection for one another.  You believe that Ponyboy, Sodapop, and Darry are brothers.  You understand the love Dally felt for the puppy dog-like Johnny.  The book does take on a kind of \\"West Side Story\\" track at certain times, no question.  On their way to a rumble, the characters actually burst into song ala \\"Officer Krupky\\".  And where are all the minorities?  Severely lacking (and therefore making this book less of a great choice to teach in high schools these days).<br />Hinton, being a woman, has an odd take on females in this book.  Ponyboy is not interested in the girls in his social set.  Greaser girls are, according to him, too harsh and unfeminine.  The Soc girls, on the other hand, are just his type.  Personally, I was a little offended by the idea that the richer a girl is the more desirable she becomes.  But what's a classic tale without some archaic elements?<br />It is a little hard to forgive the slang of this book at times.  But compared to some other slangy novels, this one's pretty good.  There is the occasional, \\"You dig okay\\", and other unfortunate phrasings, but they're kept to a bare minimum.  I'm not surprised this book is taught in high schools around the country either.  Swearing is non-existent and violence is, while common, deplored.  This is a pretty darn squeaky clean story.  Fortunately, it's eminently readable and somewhat deserving of its status as a \\"classic\\".But the characters really do exhibit a sense of affection for one another.

Painfully, wretchedly, miserably disappointed.  Author Jerdine Nolen and illustrator Kadir Nelson attempted something marvelous.  They were going to write a tall tale about Thunder Rose, the African-American cowgirl of the west.  She would have lightning and thunder in her veins and be the kind of child that could wrassle a steer to the ground.  This was going to be the new picture book classic.  It had all the markings of one, there's no doubt.  Sassy heroine.  Good set of ideas and the illustrator of the fabulous \\"The Village That Vanished\\".  And best yet, Jerdine Nolen wrote that wonderful, \\"Harvey Potter's Balloon Farm\\" (which, if I were you, I'd run out and grab this instant).  So what happened?  This book had everything going for it, and it fell flat on its face.  But I'll start from the beginning.<br />Here's the plot of \\"Thunder Rose\\".  As I mentioned, Rose was a remarkable baby.  She was able to juggle lightning and thunder mere minutes after she was born and speak in complete sentences.  If she got thirsty she'd merely pick up the nearest cow and drink her dry.  As she grew older, Rose constructed her very own thunderbolt out of scrap iron and named it Cole.  At twelve she could stop a stampede and ride a steer like a horse.  When rain won't come to the prairie, Rose takes it upon herself to draw the rain from the sky and finds instead that she must do battle with a tornado.<br />Okay, fine.  Tall tales usually have this kind of rhythmic rise and fall to the action.  As a story goes on. the hero's accomplishments are supposed to get grander and more ludicrous, culminating in a showdown of some sort with either a force of nature of a force of man.  Unfortunately, the words and pictures used to illustrate this text aren't up to the challenge of complimenting such a grandiose story.  The narration is particularly difficult to both read and understand.  I'm not talking about drawl.  A good story has an ear for well spoken dialogue.  Unfortunately, the dialogue in this here tall tale is sparse.  Mostly, we get narration that makes some fairly odd statements.  For example, after creating a barbed wire fence for her parents, the two ask Rose where she got the idea.<br /><br />\\"Oh that,\\" she said.  \\"While I was staking the fence, Pa asked me to keep little Barbara Jay company.  That little twisty pattern seemed to make the baby laugh.  So I like to think of it as Barbara's Wire\\".<br />This is supposed to be an amusing explanation as to why we refer to barbed wire as such.  Now, I'd just like to point out that this statement on the part of Rose comes clear out of the blue.  Who the heck is Barbara Jay?  This is a character never mentioned in the text except for this moment and there certainly isn't a single picture of a baby apart from young Rose in the book.  It's such a random section in such a random scene (and believe me, it is not the only one) that I can only assume that the editor trimmed out the scenes that referred to this character beforehand and then failed to catch this non sequitor of a section later.<br />The whole pace of the book is just off, and it makes for awkward reading.  Worse still is the melding of text and illustration.  I'm the first one to say that illustrator Kadir Nelson is a genius.  Thunder Rose is absolutely perfect in this book.  Her gait, her expressions, and her attitude is dead right.  This illustrator imbues her character with just enough oomph and polish to make you fall in love with her instantly.  Unfortunately, these delightful pictures of Rose don't always work well with the story.  If I read on the left page that Rose constructed a building \\"tall enough to scrape the sky\\", I don't want to look on the right page and see Rose sedately carrying milk buckets.  And if the left page says that a churning tornado split into two and came at Rose from two opposite directions, I do not want to just see Rose sitting on her bull looking up at a single solitary twister.The pictures in this book are phenomenal.  They just don't go well with the story at times.<br />So you see why I was disappointed.  I was expecting a book that had the visual draw and narrative pull of Anne Isaacs's \\"Swamp Angel\\".  \\"Swamp Angel\\" is pretty remarkable and it's not fair to compare the two simply because they're both modern tall tales told about strong females.  On the other hand, there is no reason in the world why this book shouldn't have been one of the best new picture books of the last few years.  Instead, it's so close to being a great book, and so very very far.  There's stuff to love in this story, but for me it's these wonderful details that bring to book's faults staggeringly to light.  A real pity.The pictures in this book are phenomenal.  They just don't go well with the story at times.<br />So you see why I was disappointed.

Books	5	1	1	N	N	Australian slang and wombats galore	It's no secret that there are thousands of fantastic unknown children's books out there.  I would even go so far as to estimate that over 60% of the best kid books disappear without so much as a ripple under the waves of subsequently published literature.  So this is all the more reason to appreciate a well-written unknown book when you find it.  That book, such as it is, is Elizabeth Honey's \\"Don't Pat the Wombat\\".  A fine frolicsome Aussie import, this tale of kids, camp, and canoes is one of the best kept secrets in fiction today.  And it's freakin' hilarious.<br />The plot follows a group of roughly ten year-old boys called The Coconuts.  They named themselves that after the narrator(nickname: Exclamation Mark)'s mom drove them around singing, \\"I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts...\\"  The other boys include Wormz, Nicko, Azza, Mitch, and Jonah.  Jonah, to be honest, is the real hero of this tale.  A calm silent boy, Jonah earns the wrath of the school's most dreaded teacher, The Bomb.  When the boys head out for summer camp (an event that included not only the boys but their teachers from school and two parents) it's just their bad luck that The Bomb comes along for the ride.<br />First of all, this book is undoubtedly one of the funniest I've read in a very long time.  Funny books never get any respect, you know.  Not adult funny books, nor children's funny books.  This is a story where the narrator's mom plays on a basketball team called The Cellulites.  The pictures, supposedly drawn by the author, are a hoot and a holler (and frighteningly similar to pictures an actual ten year-old would draw).  And the storyline has the boys pulling the kind of innocent pranks you'd expect of them.  I was particularly taken with a moment where the boys (after a rousing mud fight) decided to play dead to see what their German counselor Helmut would do:<br />\\"Oh, they're dead!\\" goes Helmut.  \\"What a pity, I'd better bury them,\\" and he started shoveling mud on us.<br />It's that kind of story.  On top of that, there's some interesting Australian language to grapple with.  America is the kind of country that takes great pains in changing words in the Harry Potter books that appear \\"too British\\" for delicate American children's ears.  Apparently, Australian slang is a completely different matter.  Initially I was quite taken aback by the amount of words I either couldn't understand or couldn't pronounce.  Here's a great example.  It describes the teacher nicknamed Chook:<br />\\"If something goes right, she says, `Jolly beaut!' and if something goes wrong, she goes, `Blinking heck!' For something amazing, she says, `By jingo!' She wears Daisy Duck shoes\\".<br />The book's full of this kind of thing.  When a boy calls his teacher a nerd his mother patiently corrects him and says the terms he's looking for is \\"duffer\\".  Slang includes words like \\"derr\\" as well.  I mean, I think it's great!  More books should be coming into our country with these kinds of words.  But if you're not prepared for them, it's a bit of a shock.<br /><br />If I have any objections with this book it's that it's too darn short.  Too short by far.  You finally are beginning to get a little more insight into the characters and before you know it, time's up!  Story's done.  All in all, however, I consider this book one of the lost greats.

If someone asks you to state an opinion one way or another, whether you're asked if you'd like a slice of cake or how you would like your hamburger cooked, you give an answer.  If you chose to say, \\"I don't care\\", however, you are to be subjected to unending torments.  For two minutes.  The classic Sendakian classic, \\"Pierre\\", understands the horrendous nature of this sin.  Taking a sort of \\"Mrs. Piggle Wiggle\\" type of extremist cure (in this case, getting eaten by a lion) the book examines Pierre's sin of noncommittalness and treats him accordingly.<br />Pierre is a well dressed lad.  Sporting a jaunty blue suit and no shoes or socks whatsoever, he lives with his respectable mama and pop.  In the first chapter, Pierre's mother attempts to elicit some sort of a decision from her son aside from, \\"I don't care!\\".  Failing to do so, chapter two follows Pierre's father, who attempts the same thing.  In chapter three a lion appears and the oblivious Pierre is eaten, after much dialogue with the aforementioned feline.  By chapter four the parents have discovered the sickly lion (Pierre didn't go down so well, I suppose) and swiftly take the lion to the hospital.  Happy ending, chapter five, the doctor merely shakes the lion and out pops Pierre.  From then on, Pierre cares.<br />The book has much in common with the classic Little Red Riding Hood tale.  Fortunately, rather than cutting Pierre out, the doctor (looking like nothing so much as a slightly modified Mr. Magoo) removes Pierre by upending the lion.  The lion has seemingly learned his lesson as well, and serves as a mode of transportation for the transformed Pierre and his loving, well dressed parents.  The story is small, simple, and easy to read.  It's also one of the odder morals out there.  But then again, maybe it's a lesson that we all should have learned long ago.  It is better to care than to remain indifferent.  A difficult thing to teach, but by no means impossible.  In my opinion, one of Sendak's best books ever.means impossible.  In my opinion, one of Sendak's best books ever.	2004-04-18

There are relatively few picture books out there that follow the adventures of Inuit girls.  I'm not the world's foremost expert on what Inuit books have been written for youth in America, but I am certain that amongst them, this is one of the finest.<br />Pani and her grandmother live alone in their own igloo.  Pani yearns to become a hunter and bring good food to herself and her grandmamma.  However, as a young girl, she must content herself with merely fishing with a lure that once belonged to her mother.  Galled by the comments of her peers who claim that girls can never become hunters, Pani spies a dying polar bear cub in the cold wilderness.  It would be easy enough to allow the bear to die, thus bringing food and fur into her home and earning herself the long desired title of hunter.  Compassion wins over such desires, however, and Pani works to save the bear's life.  After having done so, the bear speaks to her and brings her to his home.  Pani is rewarded with the gift of a pouch that shall always contain food and furs a-plenty for Pani and her grandmother.<br />The tale is, according to the book's bookflap, a traditional Inuit legend.  Just the same, it contains many elements found in myths worldwide.  The young girl taking pity on a stronger creature and helping it to live.  A packet that is always filled with food.  The desire to prove oneself to one's peers.  It's all here, but wrapped up in an entirely new light and story.  Buskey's writing is crisp and clear, telling a straightforward tale in such a way that the reader never feels bogged down by the dialogue or narrative.  Complimenting this tale adeptly are Vladyana Langer Krykorka's incredibly beautiful illustrations.  Each page seems to glow with a mix of melded iridescent colors.  The pictures here throb with a life entirely of their own.  Not only is Krykorka respectful in her depictions of Inuits and their life but she makes a land that some would consider barren look absolutely gorgeous.

She knows what she's good at and she doesn't stray from her particular brand of storytelling.  If you've ever read a Jan Brett story then you're already familiar with her style.  Each tale usually exists in a snow covered land, where vaguely European peasant-like people go about their daily lives.  You're not going to read a Jan Brett that's set in the grimy suburbs of southern Philadelphia or the desert-like atmosphere of Bahrain.  And that's fine.  Here, with \\"The Gingerbread Baby\\", Brett has taken a classic fairy tale and given it a twist of an ending.  The result is an effective retelling that should please even the most die-hard traditionalists.<br />First of all, the book explains EXACTLY why the Gingerbread Baby appears in the first place.  In the original tale, a woman cooking the gingerbread merely opens the oven door and out pops the cocky cookie.  In this story, however, a boy (Matti) and his mother are following the recipe found in a worn-looking cookbook.  Though the recipe instructs to bake a gingerbread boy for a full eight minutes, \\"No more. No less. DO NOT peek\\", Matti cannot resist taking just a little glance at the yummy pastry man.  Too late he realizes his mistake and the Gingerbread Baby (it's still too young to be a gingerbread boy, you see) leaps out to its freedom.  The next few pages show the various modes of escape the creature uses to keep from being eaten by everyone from Matti's parents to dogs, goats, pigs, peasants, and a crafty fox.  In the traditional story, the fox is the clever party that devours the Gingerbread Boy.  Not so here.  In an interesting twist, Matti bakes a gingerbread house for the naughty baby, and rescues his creation from the villagers by simply luring the Gingerbread creature into its home.  The final panel shows the delighted Gingerbread Baby dancing about its little home safe and sound while Matti looks on.<br />Personally, I was rooting for the fox.  But this ending will certainly please any parent who's child has seen \\"Shrek\\" fifty plus times over and cannot contemplate such a dire fate for the partying pastry.  So while I feel the original tale had more kick and verve, I don't have any serious problems with this tale.  Brett gives the Gingerbread Baby enough of a sense of humor to tie the braids of his female pursuers together as well as leaping onto an ice floe when danger comes ever nearer.  Brett's illustrations are the real stars of the show, however.  Very very few illustrators pay half as much detail to their entire books as Brett does to a single square inch of any page.  Her pictures are as adept at displaying blue porcelain mixing bowls and copper pans and teapots as they are at flesh tones, fur, and wicker.  When you see a person with braids you can almost count the hairs on their head, they're so individualized.  Brett also excels at knitted objects.  This is an illustrator who understands the nature of knitting.  You can actually count the stitches on Matti's red sweater in this book.  And look at the minute details in the clothing each character wears.  Or the intricate scrollwork of their furniture.  Or the different borders surrounding every page, or the tiles, or the oven, or....  It just goes on and on.  There's no other illustrator like her.  If you've a penchant for the kinds of kids books you can read over and over to the little ones that contains tiny details in every crack and corner, this is the book for you.t this ending will certainly please any parent who's child has seen \\"Shrek\\" fifty plus times over and cannot contemplate such a dire fate for the partying pastry.

An artist becomes so famous and influential that they're eventually able to go back to some of their earlier works and (to their mind) improve them.  Steven Spielberg did it with \\"E.T.\\"  Singer/songwriters are constantly reinventing their old classics.  Eric Carle did it with \\"Papa, Please Get the Moon For Me\\".  And though I usually object heartily to artistic preferences changing old classics that technically belong to the masses (ya hear that Speilberg???), in Carle's case I'm willing to make an exception.  Changing a mildly interesting story into a complicated (but hearty) pseudo pop-up book, Carle has recreated his art the only way an artist should: he has made it better.<br />Following in the tradition of such children-asking-their-parents-for-the-moon classics as \\"Many Moons\\" (highly recommended!), in this simple story a girl asks her father to please get her that large circular piece of rock in the sky.  The father complies, hauling out the longest ladder anyone has ever seen and taking it to the tallest mountain in the world.  Initially depressed by the fact that the moon is (surprise!) too large to bring to his daughter, the father is eventually comforted by the moon itself.  It tells the man that if he just waits for it to wax and wane, it'll become a manageable size in no time.  This turns out to be the case and the little girl is delighted when the father hands her the sliver that is the moon to play with.<br />The book flap says that by reading this book, children will come to realize that, \\"even a seemingly unreachable goal can actually be attained\\".  I dunno about that.  If that's the moral of this story, then I want no part of it.  No, the message I received from this tale is that a man will sometimes move heaven and earth to bring his children the things they want the most in the world.  They might not always succeed, but if a man were able to get the moon for his daughter, he'd do so.<br />Carle's illustrations are classic Carle.  I'm personally a little lukewarm on him.  The pictures here are a little more swirly and paint based than his usual cut paper concoctions.  The book flap mentions that for the reissue of this book Carle, \\"created new illustrations for his original story\\", so I do not know how much he has changed.  If the pictures are lovely, however, they are merely a compliment to the book's real joys.  Pages in this story fold out to reveal the enormity of the father's task.  A single ladder, once the pages are unfolded, takes over a four page spread.  And the moon itself, when at its full capacity, opens up to become larger than the book that holds it.  The effect is stunning and enjoyable for those kids that love interactive pictures.  Nicest of all is the durability of the paper used for these effects.  I'm sure we've all seen the effects a three-year old can wreak on a pop-up book it loves.  I took this book, published in 1986, from my local library and the pages STILL work just as well as the day they were made.  If that's not sturdiness, I don't know what is.<br />Should you be scientifically inclined and you object to such notions as a moon being physically smaller when it is but a crescent, avoid this story.  If, on the other hand, you enjoy a good fold out pop-up book enlivened by colorful cut-out illustrations as much as the next guy, then I highly recommend this delightful piece of lunar propaganda.  It is certain to be beloved of millions of star gazing children worldwide.lassic Carle.  I'm personally a little lukewarm on him.

In this simple 1957 Caldecott winner, the author and illustrator take a little time to give their full attention to the glory of trees.  In simple easy to understand sentences we hear about all the wonderful things trees do for us.  From protecting houses from dangerous winds to shading us from the sun's strong rays, this is all about the wonders of foliage and greenery.  Written in 1956, it's definitely lacking in the minority department.  You might be able to make the case that some of the kids are Asian, but on the whole there are a ton of children in this story and they are white white white.  Then too, even in a book about the timelessness of trees, there are dated elements to the story.  In one section the author revels in the wonders of autumnal leaf piles.  She then goes on to say, \\"We build playhouses out of the leaves.  Then we pile them up with our rakes and have a bonfire\\".  Accompanied, of course, by a shot of a kid standing next to a smoldering pile.  Better explain quickly to your children why setting huge piles of leaves on fire, as the child in the picture is, probably isn't the best of ideas in this day and age.<br />Altogether though, I've few complaints.  The pictures are truly stunning and the story a nice quiet read.  I was a little baffled by the gargantuan apple tree the kids climb at one point.  Where the heck do they grow apple trees that TOWER over the land like this one?  But this is a great tale to read in terms of environmental consciousness.  The story ends by telling the reader that if he or she plants a tree of their own, their friends and neighbors will see how much fun it is and suddenly wish that THEY had a tree to plant as well.  So the cycle continues.  Consider bringing this book up on Earth Day.  It's a nice compliment to a simple staid message.	2004-04-16
706591:US	49148452	R2XW7NE1G80U9Y	0670715123	775902033	Time of Wonder (Viking Kestrel picture books)	Books	4	24	25	N	N	Time keeps on slipping	(...)<br />The story, such as it is, follows a family in their summer home on an island in the ocean.  Mostly following the children, the story reflects on the wonders of nature itself.  The kids walk out into the mist on warm summery mornings.  They leap from high ocean rocks, and sun themselves as the rocks grow warm.  They sail a boat at night (they've fairly trusting parents, I'd wager) to spy on deep water crabs.  Eventually, a hurricane comes to batter the family in their sturdy little home.  In the end, the family must return to their real house/life/school and wait to return to the island another year.  As they leave, the narrator opines that such moments as these make living a real time of wonder.  A time for pondering things like, \\"I wonder where hummingbirds go in a hurricane\\".<br /><br />Working in a medium unlike his usual pencils and inks, McCloskey seemed to draw the images in this book from a very private source.  Though you may never have been in a summer home such as this or experienced moments like the ones the children go through, you feel the nostalgia embedded in this story.  I may not have ever summered in places where I could make forts out of huge sea stones, but after reading this book I know what it would be like.  People may say books such as this don't move quickly enough for kids today.  Don't believe it.  Kids are kids and good books are good books.  The child that appreciates Elmo's World is still going to feel a sense of (for lack of a better word) wonder when they stare at the picture of the hurricane blowing the house's inhabitants in all directions.  Kids interested in technical ship jargon and the process of buying supplies before a big storm will be fascinated by this tale as well.  Some stories do not age.  Others, age in such a way that they become deep and full-bodied like a good fine wine.  \\"A Time of Wonder\\" falls into the latter category.  Take a moment to enjoy it fully.	2004-04-14

I'm always pleased when an author and an illustrator of equal talents are placed together by a clever editor so as to produce a wonderful piece of picture book art.  Jane Yolen is the author of, honest to goodness, more than two hundred books for both children and adults.  Just pause a while and marvel at her consistency, if you will.  Mark Teague may not have that many works under his belt, but what he lacks in proliferation he makes up for in downright fabulous illustrating.  If you've read his charming \\"Dear Mrs. LaRue: Letters From Obedience School\\" then you are aware of how amazingly adept this man is.  Taking those monstrous creatures co-opted by children as their favorite animals, Yolen and Teague have created a book that proves what we've suspected all along.  Your children are merely little dinosaurs in disguise.<br />The premise of this book is simple.  Sleepy dinosaurs do NOT want to go to bed at night.  The book ponders just how exactly these dinos do say their goodnights to their parents.  The parents in this book, by the way, are always human while their dinosaur offspring fill their bedrooms from ceiling to floor.  So how do dinosaurs say good night?  Well, they can insist on reading one more book.  They can fall onto their beds in tears.  They can slam their tails about and pout too.  But no, my friends.  In the end, dinosaurs do none of these things.  Instead, they give their parents a big kiss and a hug, tuck their tales into their beds, and say good night.  Just like a good little dinosaur should.<br />The hope after reading this tale is that kids will understand that all the naughty behavior exhibited by the dinosaurs in the early parts of the book will be negated by the good behavior exhibited at the end.  How well this works, I do not know.  One thing is for certain, however.  Mark Teague is a genius.  Oh, I'm sure Jane Yolen put a lot of work into this puppy as well.  Yes yes.  But Mark Teague... now there's a man who knows how children react at nighttime.  These pictures are just a scream.  Each father or mother than enters the dinosaur's room is usually accompanied by some cowering pet, either a dog or a cat.  The dinosaur's rooms are outfitted as a child's would be too.  Teague has helpfully included each animal's name (from the roaring Triceratops to the piggy back begging Ankylosaurus) somewhere in the picture too.  I was also well pleased with the parents in this book.  A good multi-racial cast, they don't give an inch to these plying crying dinos.  And you haven't lived until you've seen a Tyranosaurus Rex kissing his Donna Reed look-alike mother.  More recently popular dinosaurs, like the Velociraptor, do not appear in this tale.  Probably a good idea in retrospect.<br />All in all, this is one of the most successful new bedtime books to come around the pike.  For those kids bored to tears by the far calmer \\"Goodnight Moon\\", this will be just the exciting bedtime tale to get them tucked away for the night.  A fabulous creation that fully lives up to its popularity.t at nighttime.  These pictures are just a scream.

I have a horrible nasty habit that I've been fighting against for years and years.  When I see that a book, whether for adult or child, has won an award of any sort, I immediately become the Queen of the Critique.  Suddenly, no matter how wonderful or well written the book is, I'm continually underwhelmed.  I read through the tale and think to myself, \\"Well, it was good.  It just wasn't THAT good\\".  Now that is my usual reaction.  Thankfully, it is not my only reaction.  And after reading \\"My Family Plays Music\\", I am proud to say that it wasn't my reaction in the least.  My response to this fine creation was something far more along the lines of, \\"It WAS that good!  Well, I'll be darned\\".<br />Following a spunky girl sporting cornrows and a purple bow smack dab in the middle of her head, we observe her pointed observations about each member of her family.  The child of a uniquely musical fam, each person related to her excels in a different genre.  Her mother plays in a country western band, as her father lends his talents to a string quartet.  Some people in this family play rock and roll.  Others pipe out cool jazz in clubs like \\"The Blue Note\\".  There's swing music, and bongos in poetry cafes.  The girl even has relatives involved in everything from church organs to (and my credulousness was stretched a bit on this one) polka bands.  Mmm.  Nonetheless, everyone has their part to play.  As each person is described, the young girl plays some type of a percussion instrument to accompany them.  I liked this fact, if only because it gives percussionists the respect they are due.  This girl is every bit as much a musician as her family members, whether she's beating out a tune on a soup kettle, cowbell, and woodblock or shaking her tambourine and maracas.  This swell story focuses on diversity without making its point and shaking it in your face.<br />A helpful glossary is included in the back of the book that explains each term that might be considered difficult for kids to understand.  These are accompanied by small pictures that define the terms clearly and concisely.  Anyone wishing to explain the difference between woodwind and brass instruments will be able to do so with this resource.  In terms of the book's construction itself, Judy Cox has written a great story.  Elbrite Brown's illustrations act as a perfect match, making it difficult to believe that this is the illustrator's first picture book.  I've rarely seen cut paper pictures that get the small details down so well.  Whether he's creating a tiny finger lifted from a fiddle or the delicate black lines that make up a man's goatee, Brown is adept at his work and we are the ones who benefit.  All in all, a great book that is entirely deserving of the 2004 Coretta Scott King Award that it has received.kids to understand.

What better way to get a grasp on the elusive Mr. Boone (who, unlike Mr. Crockett, hasn't even a catchy Disney tune to hold on to) than to read the 1941 Caldecott winning bio \\"Daniel Boone\\" by James Daugherty?  Here we have the Boone myth displayed in all its ambiguous glory.  And here too, a shameful episode in America's past brought once more to light.<br />I'll admit it right now.  Critiquing a bio-pic (at least that's what it felt like) of Daniel Boone for racism is like shooting fish in a barrel.  A biography of Mr. Boone written today would have a mightily difficult time giving Native Americans any real depth or character.  Now consider a Daniel Boone book written in the 1940s, and you see just how badly, how racist, and how cruel a children's book can be.  I could go through this book chapter by chapter and pull out every instance of anti-\\"Indian\\" sentiment and place it before you in a huff.  Instead, I'm just going to copy down here a section from the book that, to my mind, sums up the Native American feeling perfectly.  This section describes an attack on an Indian village:<br />\\"...I saw some warriors run into a house, until I counted forty-six of them.  We pursued them until we got near the house, when we saw a squaw sitting in the door, and she placed her feet against the bow she had in her hand, and then took an arrow, and raising her feet she drew with all her might and let fly at us and she killed a man, whose name I believe was Moore.  He was a lieutenant and his death so enraged us all that she was fired on, and had at least twenty balls blown through her...We now shot them like dogs; and then set the house on fire, and it burned it up with the forty-six warriors in it.  I recollect seeing a boy who was shot down near the house.  His arm and thigh were broken, and he was so near the burning house that the grease was stewing out of him.  In this situation he was still trying to crawl along; but not a murmur escaped him though he was only about twelve years old.  So sullen is the Indian when his dander is up that he had sooner die than make a noise, or ask for quarters\\".<br />I could say something snarky in response to this passage, but I think it speaks for itself.  Now, to be fair, this is a section quoted in the book itself from \\"The Autobiography of David Crockett\\" by an unnamed woodsman.  But it appears as part of the narrative of this story and it is never challenged in any way.  Great reading for the kiddies, eh?  Especially when the book later goes on to state that the Native Americans were a dying race whose members, \\"met the personal tragedy of violent death with a serene indifference\\".  Forgive me if passages like this make me mad.<br />The book follows Boone's life from birth (in the 1730s) to his death (in 1820).  It displays him finding paths into Kentucky, getting captured many many times, and killing \\"Indians\\" left and right.  You see his family members get slaughtered and his defense of the white settler forts.  Sadly, the book is rather dull in its passages.  Homestead life, as told here, is less interesting than anything found in your average \\"Little House on the Prairie\\" tale.  In fact, the most interesting aspects of this book are the fights against the \\"Indians\\".  But Daugherty wants it both ways.  Even though he consistently refers to Native Americans as \\"varmints\\", \\"red\\", and \\"savages\\" he is considerate enough to note that some \\"Indians\\" aren't bad.  He names the Native Americans by their tribes when he can.  Oddest of all, Daugherty includes a long passage from Henry Beston's, \\"American Memory\\" in which a Seneca named Red Jacket decries the betrayal of his people by the white settlers.  The passage is moving and heartfelt and, to be frank, utterly out of place in a book that celebrates the genocide of an entire race.  It's almost as if Daugherty wantedto show the other side of the story.  Instead, it's just a glimpse of the truth muffled under a book of lies, half-truths, and myths.<br />How much is actually known to be true about Boone is hard to say.  And it's not as if Daugherty has included source notes with his tale.  In any case, this book cannot be considered non-fiction.  Too often does the author say what Boone is thinking, dreaming, or planning.  Half the tales could be complete fabrications for all we know.  The accompanying illustrations look like nothing so much as modified Thomas Hart Bentons.  Men have rippling, almost grotesque, muscles and women sport overlarge feet and bosoms.<br />All in all, this book is woefully out of date and a sad testament to a style of writing that was once so prevalent.  The only reason this book is even remembered today is because of its unfortunate Newbery Award.  It's a sad case and an even sadder piece of writing.  As a historical document into the racism and Manifest Destiny mode of thought once (and perhaps still) so prevalent in America, it's a striking testament.

This book in the Prydain Chronicles is, truth be told, far more usual than its predecessors.  While the first two books in the series were fairly new and different adventure tales, this one falls back onto the standard rescue-the-princess-from-the-evil-enchantress mode.  Eilonwy is in trouble, and we learn much more about her background and history than ever before.  Added to the usual mix of characters for spice (the dwarf Doli fails to make an appearance in this tale and, I assume, leaves a gap) is another unwanted Prince.  This time it's Prince Rhun, a good-hearted if completely incompetent young man.  His betrothal to Taran's beloved Eilonwy does nothing to make our hero love him more, but the prince's sweet nature and good spirits eventually win everyone over.  Also introduced by the cat loving Alexander (remember, this is the author of the interesting \\"Time Cat\\") is Llyan, an over-sized mountain cat that has taken quite a liking to bard Fflewddur Flan's harp playing.  All in all, it's a pleasant mix of lovable characters.  As you might be able to tell, this is not a good book to begin the series with.  At this point, we know these people (and animals) fairly well and nothing they do will come as much surprise to anyone.  It still amazes me to no end how prolific kings and princes are in this land.  Though I understand that much of the point of these books is to show how little birthright counts when it comes to being good and strong.  And it is quite a relief to see Taran doing something other than hot-headedly rushing into danger as he's done in the previous two books.  Alexander's characters are growing, slowly but surely.

Beginning this tale with words that essentially paraphrase Rudyard Kipling's \\"The Cat Who Walked Alone\\", this tiger-based picture trail starts with a proud, \\"I am the tigress.  I walk alone\\".  From this point onward we follow a realistic story of a tiger and her cubs.  We see her hunt alone, and tend to her babies.  We see the family move on to new homes when there's a threat, and we watch the tigress teach the cubs to hunt on their own.  Finally, the children leave their mother and she is left alone once more, repeating, \\"I am the tigress.  I walk alone\\".<br />The pictures, supplied by the adept Laura Regan, are rendered in oil and goache and look as if they were real enough to pounce.  The story itself is simple.  Any child obsessed with these overlarge kitty cats will instantly take to the book's delightful rendering of all things striped.  Of course, these are hunting animals, so there is death as well (though skillfully left to the reader's imagination).  Admittedly, it's just a nice story.  Nothing new or brilliant about it.  It fills a niche that has been filled before and will be filled again.  But those in this world that love tigers will be grateful for it.  And in a way, that's all that matters.	2004-04-10

What's odd about this fairly peculiar little picture book is that I found myself enjoying the plot and pictures far more than the actual illusions themselves.  The storyline is as follows: Marva is your typical inventor.  One day she finds herself an accidental redhead (thanks to a ketchup based explosion) and then, in turn, an orangehead.  As Marva tries to change the color of her hair, she also finds herself having problems doing her laundry.  Colors mix and switch and soon poor Marva is changing the color of everything she owns.  Along the way kids learn about various color based optical illusions and what colors will change shades when mixed with other primaries.  In the end, Marva finds love in the handsome laundrette owner Hari Panjabi.<br />I'm having a hard time conveying what it is I liked about this book.  Apart from the fact that I LOVE that this book had a character named Hari Panjabi (quick: name three picture books that contain romantic Indian characters..... GO!) I also enjoyed the illustrations.  Marva's a hoot.  She's a short haired artistic type, prone to all black outfits and wild purple hair.  Admittedly after seeing the cover of the book I had a bit of a shock when I found out that Marva was a girl (she's definitely a little boyish sometimes) but on the whole she's great.  The illustrations work well when they're explaining color combinations.  I had some difficulty making the occasional illusion work.  Try as I might I just could not get green spots to appear on Marva's face.  But most work just fine and help the story along.  If you want something lively and a touch bizarre, this is a good choice.  I can pretty much guarantee that you've not seen anything like this ever before (and will probably never see again, I'd wager).	2004-04-10

Have you ever heard of Major Taylor?  Possibly, since you've come to look up reviews of this book.  Now there are a lot of African American greats out there that have, for one reason or another, sunk into relative obscurity.  I don't think I'm amiss in saying that Major Taylor is one of those greats.  This is the man who won the 1899 World Championship title in America and made a successful European tour of 1901, yet died a pauper's death.  Now at last there is a proper book commemorating his life and times.<br />Born in 1878, Marshall Walter Taylor (later to earn himself the nickname of \\"Major\\") led a surprisingly good life for a black man in the late nineteenth century.  Belonging to a household that educated him and gave him his own bicycle, he quickly learned to do a variety of tricks on it.  When the chance to race came along, Taylor quickly started earning himself a variety of accolades.  Just as important as the races he won, however, were the ways in which he dealt with the open racism and poor treatment of other cyclists.  Taylor was patient and a winner.  His mantra, \\"I simply ride away\\".<br />The book itself has a couple flaws here and there that I found it hard to get around.  The story of Taylor's life really take a wonderful turn when he joins up with the racer Louis \\"Birdie\\" Munger.  Yet no picture of Birdie, important as he is, ever pops up.  Also, the book culminates with a huge race between Major Taylor and the already established French champion.  But try as I might to find out what the name (and significance) of this race was, I came up short.  The race, oddly enough, is never named.  In the end, the appeal of the book may or may not be all that great on the part of kids.  Some may be interested in a bicycling champion that began by doing bike stunts.  Some may not.  The book is followed by a quick note at the end of what the rest of Taylor's life led to.  It is not a particularly happy ending (he separated with his family, died a pauper's death, and was buried in an unnamed grave until exhumed and placed in a better spot).  Just the same, it reflects on what Taylor meant to the rest of the world and what he stood for.  Though this is not the most thrilling book in the world, it's a useful one and serves its purpose as well as it can.his family, died a pauper's death, and was buried in an unnamed grave until exhumed and placed in a better spot).

But, just the same, a worrisome tale.  In this classic Steig work, a young donkey comes across a magic pebble.  The pebble is round and smooth and a brilliant red.  Entranced by it, Sylvester finds that he can wish for whatsoever he chooses and instantly receive it.  Overjoyed he turns for home, but finds himself confronting a hungry lion.  In his haste and fear, Sylvester accidentally wishes he were a rock.  Unfortunately, this wish works but leaves Sylvester trapped in his new rocky form.  And when his parents look for him high and low and cannot find him, Sylvester is believed to be forever lost.  But as I said, all turns out well in the end.<br />This story is somewhat heart-wrenching to parents.  Certainly the kids that read it will understand how sad Sylvester would be to potentially never return home again.  And parents reading this will be overwhelmed with the emotions involved with the loss of a child.  Perhaps this story won the 1970 Caldecott medal because it does go so far as to directly touch on this most sensitive of topics.  At the same time, this may be a kids book but it's too much for me.  Silly, isn't it?  I can zip through William Styron's \\"Sophie's Choice\\" and have a grand old time, but \\"Sylvester and the Magic Pebble\\" reduces me to a pile of wobbling jello.  Enjoy with caveats galore.	2004-04-10

Dr. Seuss's popular elephant starred in not one but two of Theodore Geisel's great picture books for the kiddies.  Now with the 100th Anniversary of Dr. Suess's birth nigh upon us, it's a good idea to take a look at some of his most successful books to appreciate them fully once again.<br />Mayzie bird is a lazy bird, and would much rather be flying off to somewhere fun rather than tend to her egg.  But when friendly (and gullible) Horton passes by her, Mayzie sees her chance to grab a little R & R in sunny Palm Beach.  She convinces Horton to sit on her egg, a ploy that works despite Horton's concerns.  Once gone, however, Mayzie decides \\"never\\" to go back to her nest again.  Horton, stuck with the egg on his own, does everything he can to ensure it's safety.  Through blizzard, teasing, capture, and seasickness Horton is faithful to his promise, \\"One hundred percent\\".  When the egg finally hatches (and Mayzie insists on claiming it once the work has been finished) the result is a surprise and delight to the patient elephant.<br />There's a lot to love in this old story.  The Seussian rhyming schemes (often parodied but rarely equaled) have the perfect amount of syllables per line.  Every page scans easily, and you cannot help but hear the words spoken in your brain as you read them.  I remember growing up in Kalamazoo, Michigan as a child and delighting at the reading of the places Horton travels (ala circus) that mentioned my own rhymable home town.  Such lines are coupled with the fabulous illustrations that show every minute of Horton's misery in wrenching detail (though not so much that you ever think the elephant is under too serious duress).  Thus the payoff at the end is even better than you could hope for.  It's amazing how memorable I find these illustrations, even now some twenty years later.  There's something about Dr. Seuss that just connects with children on the deepest level imaginable.  And there's something about \\"Horton Hears the Who\\" that deserves that connection.\\"Horton Hears the Who\\" that deserves that connection.	2004-04-10

Over the years I remembered odd snippets of the story.  The old abandoned house.  The portraits of beautiful women that moved.  The shoe repairing leprechaun in the garden.  It was only recently that I decided to track down this story and reread it for myself.  You see, my fourth grade teacher never finished \\"The Wicked Pigeon Ladies In the Garden\\" (since renamed \\"The Wicked Wicked Ladies In the Haunted House\\") and, when last heard from, the heroine of the story was in dire straights.<br />In this tale, a bratty young girl gets the ultimate comeuppance.  Having broken into an abandoned old mansion, she quickly finds herself at odds with the horrible inhabitants.  When Maureen (the aforementioned girl) steals a bracelet belonging to one of the long lost daughters of the house, she sets off a chain of events that takes her back in time.  Along the way, she makes the acquaintance of a leprechaun, who offers her the only way possible back home to her family.<br />So I reread the story in its entirety.  Originally published in 1968, I was disappointed to find the writing mediocre.  For some reason, author Mary Chase was excellent at making memorable characters and plot points while not being particularly good at writing itself.  In this story, seven vain sisters from the Victorian era break their parents' hearts by turning themselves into pigeons and flying away.  The leprechaun muses that perhaps a greater good will come of it.  Unfortunately, that greater good is apparently the same moral Dorothy in \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" learned.  Namely, teaching our heroine that there's no place like home.  So ruining the lives of two people is worth one young bratty girl learning a lesson.  Mmm hmm.  There are other problems as well.  I remember being very confused as a child as to the fact that the girl, Maureen, is never helped by the one pigeon lady who she was nice to.  And then there's just the writing itself.  It's not awful.  But any kid who's suddenly thrown into the past is going to catch on pretty quickly that they aren't in the present day.  For Maureen, it takes roughly 36 hours.<br />This isn't a terrible story, mind you, but there are better ones out there.  Still, there's no arguing with the fact that this book made a huge impression on me when I was young.  For the kid interested in mysterious goings on and ladies in beautiful evening gowns, this book is a great read.  So sayeth my former 10 year-old self.one pigeon lady who she was nice to.

Let's take a gander at the beauty of this cover, ladies and gentlemen.  First of all, it's beyond beautiful.  It's stunning.  Two women, one grown and one small, gaze coolly at the viewer.  They are surrounded by the elements of their trade, namely herbs with a pistle & morter.  I salute the cover artist in this case.  Both characters are unaccountably and undeniably right.<br /><br />Wise Child lives in an early Scottish community.  Her mother left her long ago and her father is a shipman, ever away at sea.  When her grandmother dies of old age, Wise Child is nine years old and utterly alone in the world.  Taken in by the local witch, Wise Child is initially reluctant to live with someone potentially evil.  In time, however, she comes to love her guardian, Juniper, and the two become close.  Even as Wise Child's mother, an evil sorceress, lays claim on her child and the villagers grow restless at having a witch in such close proximity the two stick together.  This is a story about finding the person who loves you and bearing with them through thick and thin.  It's about love.<br /><br />Furlong's an elegant writer, and this was an amazingly well wrought tale.  Juniper is almost without fault, though she is by no means unlikable because of her perfection.  Certainly I felt the woman's hands off approach towards raising a willful child was a little bizarre.  Juniper is almost never angry with the initially spoiled Wise Child, and one has to wonder what a less well-behaved tyke would have done in her place.  Wise Child herself is entirely human and full of the kind of flaws that make her real and interesting.  She's rarely in complete control of any situation, but she knows her own mind.  The book itself is very appropriate for younger viewers.  There's relatively little violence and zippo inappropriate language.  Even Wise Child's flighty parents were married when she was born.  You probably would have a hard time finding a book more appropriate for those kids that want a fantasy but are also attached to stories with a good solid grasp on reality.  I myself was drawn to the idea of the strong wise woman raising a girl child on her own.  The book works best when it recognizes different points of view and calmly points them out without screaming or battering you over the head with the moral.  In fact, even as I write this, I realize that this is a story about morality in the finest sense.  It's about accepting others and being true to what is good and pure in human beings, regardless of religion or beliefs.  And in today's madcap world, that's exactly the kind of message we should be striving to get out there more and more.  A gem.propriate for those kids that want a fantasy but are also attached to stories with a good solid grasp on reality.

Though a worthy subject and a fascinating tale, this particular biography of the great Bessie C. is an awkwardly formal affair.  Containing no source notes aside from a brief authorial thank you at the start of the book, most of the facts surrounding the life and times of Bessie Coleman are credited to Marion Coleman, Bessie's niece.  Reading through this tale, I could only conclude that it was a pity that such a dry product could come from this powerful woman's life.<br />Bessie Coleman was a sharecropper's daughter in Waxahachie, Texas.  Having grown up poor, Ms. Coleman moved to Chicago, Illinois to make a name for herself.  After years of hard work, Bessie determined that the only job she wanted was to become an aviatrix.  Scrimping and saving allowed Bessie to travel to France, where she was able to earn her pilot's license.  Throughout the years Bessie would wow American audiences everywhere with her tricks and derring-do.  In the end, Bessie died in a plane crash and was buried in Chicago once more.  Her life allowed her to become the first African-American to earn a pilot's license.  Not the first black woman but the first black person ever!  Fairly impressive stuff.<br />There's a kind of disconnect between the words in this book and the images on its pages.  Both the words and the illustrations are rather stiff and formal.  Each illustration is contained neatly within its own little space and every narrative sequence is typed in nice little sections.  It's funny that I felt the book to be so blah.  There's no one moment in the story where I could say to myself, \\"Now THAT is why I find this telling so dull!\\".  For the most part the story is factual (to the best of my knowledge), the only exception possibly being the moment when the text says the following about Bessie's license:<br />\\"It was the very best license to have:<br />With it, Bessie could fly anywhere in the world.<br />Nobody could say, `You're a Negro woman, you can't fly.'\\"<br />Well.... actually they probably could.  That's a bit of a problem with this book.  Racism is just sorta understood to have existed in some form.  But it's never confronted directly.  Most of the pictures in this book are of (sorry but it's true) smiling happy black people.  No white person is ever singled out as racist or contributing to the system of racism.  Bessie herself must have encountered several instances of it within her lifetime, but they are never mentioned.  The fact that Bessie has to learn to fly in France is said matter of factly.  Yet the comparative European openness towards African Americans is never mentioned.  All in all, a kid's going to need a lot more explanation about WHY Bessie had problems during her life since this book's not about to clear up such questions.  It's a worthy effort, but it falls well short of the mark.`You're a Negro woman, you can't fly.'\\"<br />Well.... actually they probably could.  That's a bit of a problem with this book.

In John Steptoe's elegant, \\"Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters\\", careful readers pick up echoes of such myths as Psyche & Cupid, Cinderella, and Roses & Pearls.  Yet the story is inspired by an original folktale from 1895.  Dedicating this book to the children of South Africa, Steptoe has created one of the most beautiful and eloquent picture books of our time.<br />Once there was a man with two beautiful daughters.  Both were equal in loveliness, but different in temperament.  While Nyasha was kind and good, Manyara was vain and cruel.  When the king announces that he would like to meet these two girls and decide, between the two of them, which one he shall wed, the sly Manyara does her darndest to become queen and make her sister her servant.<br />The tale is vaguely disturbing in all the right ways.  When Manyara sets out to get a jump on the king's affections by reaching the palace first, she comes across a series of odd sequences.  A boy (with ears Spock himself would envy) is denied food, laughing trees are laughed back at, and a man with his head under his arm is ignored callously.  The moral of the story is, of course, that to be good and kind is far better than to be cold and mean.  Steptoe's illustrations lift this tale from being merely good to extraordinary.  There is a realism to the characters that leaves the reader with little doubt that they were fashioned on real people.  Steptoe has likewise stayed faithful to the land of Zimbabwe, where this tale is set.  He has been inspired by everything from the architecture to the flora and fauna.  But what I liked best was the clothing.  The garments and jewelry of this story encase the characters, making each person practically a member of royalty.  Take especial care to note the wedding clothes at the end of the story, as well as the view of the village.  The story is gorgeous in both what it says and how it says it.  One of the best books for children ever written.  Ever.the best books for children ever written.  Ever.	2004-04-10

Suteyev (Rise and Shine)	Books	4	7	7	N	N	One side makes you taller, the other side makes you small	A somewhat oblique tale about how sharing/love/goodwill towards your fellow man leads to an increase in even more sharing/love/goodwill.  Adapted from the Russion of a one V. Suteyev, this soggy tale follows a small ant in the rain.  When the sky begins to pour, the little ant has only just enough room to fit under a tiny mushroom.  Soon, more and more creatures arrive to take refuge under the fungus.  Finally, the animals band together to hide a rabbit from a hungry fox, making their toil well worth the effort.  As the rain abates, the little ant ponders why it is that the mushroom was able to accommodate so many woodland creatures, and he learns a little about what mushrooms do in the rain.<br />The story is illustrated by the talented Jose Aruego (of \\"Leo the Late Bloomer\\" fame) and is rather amusing.  Colorful too, in a sense, though nothing compared to \\"Leo\\".  Aruego has a good sense of humor.  As each animal or insect crawls under the mushroom, we are privy to a montage of different positions and poses as the other creatures move about to accommodate him/her.  This is especially amusing when the fox inspects the mushroom's inhabitants for its bunny prey.  He pokes and prods and even goes so far as to lift the entire mushroom onto one side (with the rabbit cleverly ensconced on the other).  I was half expecting this story to turn out like so many other animals-trying-to-fit-in-a-small-space books.  Usually this kind of story would end with the mushroom exploding into a million pieces with all the animals getting wet.  Not so here.  I give author Ginsburg/Suteyev a lot of credit for not taking the easy ending on this tale.  It's much easier to end a story with a big ole explosion than with a quiet understated moral.  All in all, successful.	2004-04-10

In this particularly charming tale, a curious duck eyes a shiny red bicycle on the farm.  Judging himself a worthy rider, Duck hops onto the bike and visits all the other animals on the farm.  Each animal responds with their own particular sound (moos, meows, woofs, etc.) but think what they will about Duck's exploits.  When a large bike riding group of youngsters arrive on the farm and head inside the house, their own bicycles become too much of a lure for the barnyard fellows and soon the yard is full of wheeling critters.<br />Using a selection of beautiful paints, novel characters, and interesting angles, author/illustrator David Shannon (of \\"No, David\\" fame) has created a truly delightful tale.  His attention to detail is remarkable.  Kids that remember that when Duck passed the goat his thought was, \\"I'd like to eat that bike!\\" will be rewarded if they notice that once on such a contraption, the goat makes a point of chewing on the available basket.  And honestly, who else could draw a horse sneering any better than Shannon?  The curl of the lip is an expression I've often expected on certain finicky animals.  Safety conscious parents will note that the pack of kids arriving on the farm, aside from being nicely multicultural and of different genders, are almost all wearing safety helmets.  So well done there.  And as a personal note, I always give extra points to those illustrators that understand the beauty of the silent gag.  The two page spread of the animals eying the new bicycles eagerly will make parents laugh in appreciation and make gleeful those kids that can figure out what is about to occur.  And much like the more recent \\"Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus\\", we can appreciate the troubles that might come from Duck's curious perusal of an unmanned tractor on the last page.

I hadn't read \\"Curious George\\" in years, and I was admittedly a little hesitant to do so when I saw the copyright date.  1941.  Now due to the fact that George is originally from Africa, I had a sneaking fear and suspicion that there would be some terrible racist images to contend with.  Imagine my surprise when I found that, as it happens, not a single horrid stereotype appears!  Just the same, I have to point out that at the same time not a single positive stereotype appears either.  This is a book bereft of people with skin that isn't white as newly driven snow.  Bear this in mind.<br />Curious George does his darndest to live up to his name.  A naughty little monkey, he is swiftly captured in Africa by the Man in the Yellow Hat (one prays he's no relation to \\"Tuck Everlasting\\"'s Man in the Yellow Suit).  George is taken from his jungle paradise en route to the zoo.  Along the way, George has a series of wild adventures.  He takes a dip in the ocean (throwing up an amazing amount of saltwater and fish while he's rescued).  He calls the fire department and is jailed.  He escapes and flies around, balloons in hand.  In the end, George is reunited with the Man in the Yellow Hat (who, despite the damage George has inflicted on the world and its civil servants, compensates only the balloon man).  In the final parting shot of George, the monkey is happily ensconced in his new zoo life with the caption, \\"What a nice place for George to live!\\"  This is definitely a pro-zoo book.<br />Personally, I've always been kind of taken with The Man in the Yellow Hat.  Who the heck is this guy?  Apparently he's a jaunty world adventurer with a penchant for monkeys.  Most interesting is his striking resemblance to the pop on \\"Father Knows Best\\", pipe stuck squarely between his teeth, wise countenance advising his monkey ward.  He isn't the best monkey watcher.  Some might even argue that he's a bit lax in his attention, but he gets the job done.  And you just gotta love the hat.  Faaaabulous hat, yellow guy.  All in all, it's a fine story.  For kids who're interested in either monkeys or fiascos, this is a good monkey/fiasco tale.  I'm a fiasco fan myself, so this book suits me fine.

Read them this book.  Have a child interested in dark gothic tales involving secret passages and cruel hungry wolves?  Read them this book.  Have a child?  Read them this book.<br />An admission: When I was a child I avoided this book like the plague.  Why?  Because I grew up in a time when books about girls and lovable wolves/dolphins/ponies (etc.) were what all the young ladies were reading.  In a kind of rebellion against my sex I steadfastly decided not to read anything girly.  Looking at \\"The Wolves of Willoughby Chase\\" I simply saw the word \\"wolves\\" and moved on.  I probably thought it was something akin to the pandering \\"Julie of the Wolves\\".  Had I been a little more vigilant in my cover perusal, I might have notices that the aforementioned wolves are pictured slathering and drooling in anticipation of eating two young girls dressed all in furs.  This is not one of those I-Love-Wolves books you hear so much about.  It is rather, an old fashioned anti-wolf tale that delves into the seamy underbelly of class and corruption.  And it is remarkably good.<br />Young Sylvia is being sent to live with her cousin Bonnie.  Sylvia is an orphan, raised only by her elderly Aunt Jane and she is a frail lonely child.  Bonnie, by contrast, is a rich boisterous young girl with a house full of pretty things and kind servants.  When Bonnie's parents leave for several months, the girls are placed in the care of the vile Miss Slighcarp and her partner in crime, Mr. Grimshaw.  Soon enough the children are packed off to a horrendous boarding school and must find a way back to their house and home using their wits and a couple faithful friends.  The tale is rife with all the aspects of a Dickensian style novel made palatable to younger children.  There are caricatured men and women with over-stylized names.  There are moments of dire peril (without ever becoming too too dire) and lovely descriptions of pretty clothes and delicious food.<br />The book does rely on a couple old-fashioned stereotypes, but this is not particularly surprising.  Like many a Victorian novel, the true villains of this piece are members of the lower classes that wish to use any means to be above their stations.  Hence, a governess that goes about wearing the clothes of her employer is considered the height of evil itself.  But if the book is a flashback to the past, it's a flashback we've all needed for some time.  Pat Marriott's original illustrations in pen and ink deftly create the atmosphere so needed for this kind of a story.  Elements of this tale will remind children of other famous books they may have read in the past.  The thin Miss Slighcarp and her overweight boarding school friend Mrs. Brisket (could it BE any more Oliver Twist?) are not too dissimilar to the evil aunts in \\"James and the Giant Peach\\".  And the plucky young lad Simon who lives alone and on his own is not much different from Dickens in \\"The Secret Garden\\".  But just because these elements seem similar, this is not to say that the book feels repetitive or overdone.  Instead, it's an interesting story that contains just enough danger to make the plot interesting without scaring younger kid readers too much.  A success as a book and a wonderful tale.>The book does rely on a couple old-fashioned stereotypes, but this is not particularly surprising.

He has now been colored brown.  Very interesting choice on the part of the publisher.<br />I hereby nominate Rosemary Wells the winner of the Cute But Never Saccharine Picture Book Award printed between the years of 1800-2589.  You are familiar with her work, even if you have never read it.  Best known for her early board books starring the irascible Max and his patient elder sibling, the author also did slightly older fare.  In every book, however, Wells takes the side of the underdog.  The littlest sibling.  The one most prone to feeling left out.  In \\"Morris's Disappearing Bag\\" this theme has become all encompassing.  Here is a story that truly captures what it feels like to be ignored and unwanted by your siblings.<br /><br />It is Christmas Day and Morris is delighted.  As he and his three elder siblings open their presents, each rabbit (for so they are) is enraptured by their gift.  Victor gets a hockey outfit, Rose a beauty kit, and Betty (just to smash a couple stereotypes while we're at it) a chemistry set.  Morris gets a lovely bear, but it soon occurs to him that his siblings don't appreciate his present.  While they switch one another's gifts and experiment with them, Morris is left all alone.  No one wants to play with his bear.  It isn't until Morris locates an extra unwrapped present containing a bag of invisibility that Morris finally has a gift cool enough to lure his elder sibs with.<br />Is there a moral to be learned here?  I dunno.  If there was it would probably be something along the lines of \\"Get a better toy and win the love of your fellow man\\".  I don't buy it, personally.  I think this is just a fun adorable tale illustrated with Rosemary Wells's fantastic pictures.  No one draws adorable bunnies like this woman.  Or so perfectly evokes a child feeling sorry for himself.  Morris sitting all by himself with his ears at half mast is so simultaneously cute and pitiful, you just want to give his roly-poly little body a big big hug.  All in all, this is a fantastic book (the older brother applying make-up to his face is worth the price of admission alone).

In this simple tale, Anna is the daughter of a bookbinder.  Her father is slowly loosing his business to the new competitive binderies, and her mother is pregnant with their second child.  When the unexpected birth coincides poorly with an urgent binding order, it's up to Anna to practice the family art and save the day.<br />First of all, I'd just like to say what a relief it is to have a heroine in a picture book wearing glasses.  Usually if a girl is in a book and there are glasses on her head, the ENTIRE storyline concentrates on her acceptance of the glasses or she is a computer/science/math genius.  In this story, no mention is made of them, so well done there.  The plot and setting of the story, however, are a bit unclear.  It appears that this tale takes place somewhere in Europe, possibly before World War Two.  Anna and her family could well be Jewish, but if so the author's not telling.  The plot is intricately tied to the classic Aesop tale of the Tortoise and the Hare, with the motto \\"Slow and steady wins the race\\"  (Anna's mantra).  Just to be facetious, I'll point out that though the book rails against binding books with glue, \\"glue will get hard and the books' spines will crack\\", this book itself is glue bound.  But all in all, it's a fine story.  Not particularly thrilling or different, but nice.  If you've a kid into book binding, I couldn't think of a better choice (mixed praise, I know).	2004-04-10

Primarily, it is considered \\"The Great Lost Young Adult Novel\\".  The one that got away.  Everyone remembers \\"The Chocoate War\\" or \\"The Outsiders\\".  But how many high schools teach \\"The Quartzsite Trip\\"?  How many would dare?  In this day and age, it is still possible to locate copies of this once beloved teen book.  And it is still a fairly good read.<br />I'll be blunt.  I wasn't as taken with \\"The Quartzsite Trip\\" as I should've been.  Considering the hype it's received (author Joni Richards Bodart once referred to it as, \\"one of the quintessential novels of adolescence\\") I expected something overwhelmingly brilliant.  Instead, it's a good natured romp into the fearful, fun, and often disgusting lives of teens.  Just think of it as \\"American Pie\\" meets \\"School of Rock\\" (in terms of its teacher) meets \\"Survivor\\" the television show.  That about sums it up.<br />Every year, thirty-six high school Seniors accompany madcap teacher P.J. Cooper on his annual Quartzsite Trip.  The trip is a bus ride into the desert, where for five days these rowdy randy teens are virtually free of supervision.  P.J. Cooper is the lord and master of this trip, and he is the one responsible for choosing who gets to go.  His choices are seemingly random and encompass the broad spectrum of 1962 teen society  Only this year, P.J. goes a little too far.  And it costs him.<br />Author William Hogan is perhaps the first male author I've ever read that truly understands the intricacies of female menstruation.  It is with grace and aplomb with which he is able to describe its pains and frustrations.  In fact, William Hogan has the uncanny ability to understand the nature of most women and men dealing with adolescence at its grimiest.  On top of that, he has created the very first teen society drama that acknowledges nerds.  Read \\"Speak\\" or any other contemporary high school novel and you'll understand what I mean.  Hogan has grasped that sometimes there are people out there that just don't fit in.  His character of Margaret Ball is so pitch perfect you want to cry.  In fact, many of Hogan's characters are so realistic (despite their oft repeated 1962 setting) that you may find yourself pointing at them and matching them up with people you once knew from your own high school days.  This is Hogan's strength.<br />Unfortunately for the book, Hogan is far too reliant on his charismatic teacher P.J. Cooper.  P.J. is that teacher you find in movies every once in a while that lets the children think in new and interesting ways.  Robin Williams in &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;.  Such characters are magnificently hard to write, and I'm afraid Hogan has some difficulties with P.J.  Here we have a character that is supposed to be as charming as he is irresponsible.  P.J.'s own principal writes of him, \\"He seems more interested in winning their (the students') affection than in providing the disciplined framework they need to become self-controlled citizens\\".  Though this is the evaluation of an uptight disciple of \\"the man\\", the principal has a point.  P.J. will do anything to appear as a god to his students. He'll fake hangovers to make them love him.  He'll torture the self-possessed to make a point.  Hogan suggests that P.J.'s eventual fate is directly connected to this egotism, but that's not my problem with the character.  My problem is, P.J. isn't likable.  His wife regards him as childlike, and I'm afraid I have to agree.  He's rude and unthinking and egomaniacal.  He's supposed to be the kind of teacher you'd lay down your life for.  Instead, he comes off as too darn precocious and precious.  Though there are definitely interesting aspects to this character (his collection of the first page of different self-written novels is one of the highlights of the book) he doesn't come off as someone you'd particularly miss when he's gone.<br />But that's just me.  I mean, the book's a wild romp.  And I'd be a fool not to recommend it to you (if you could find a copy).  It's well worth reading ESPECIALLY if you're a teen.  In some odd way, I wish I'd found it myself years and years ago.  The book remains as fresh as ever and proves one unalterable point.  No matter how the world around us changes and people grow attached to technology, teens will always be exactly as they appear in \\"The Quartzsite Trip\\".

Though I think this is a great book and a really interesting way to introduce kids to notion of personal injuries, I also know for a fact that I could NOT have enjoyed this book as a child.  Mind you, this is a strictly personal matter.  I well remember another cat based picture book that worried me to no end as a child.  If any of you have ever read \\"The Patchwork Cat\\", you'll know what I mean.  I had a very hard time reading stories where cats were unhappy or in pain.  In this particular book, a cat is being taken to the vet because he is acting as if he's hurting.  The book doesn't dwell on this aspect and the cat is perfectly fine by the end of the tale, but it probably will disturb some of the more squeamish children out there.<br />In this lovely intergenerational tale, a boy accompanies his broken cat, his mother, his grandmother, and his aunt to the doctor's office.  To comfort the cat, the boy asks his mom to recount how she once broke her own arm.  The mom's story of getting \\"fixed\\" is paired with the cat's own tale of recovery.  Perkins, author of the lovely \\"Snow Music\\" (big big recommendation on that one, people!), has penned a really nice story.  The best of its kind, perhaps.  There are a few books for kids that explain the process of breaking bodily parts and the fixing that follows, but I don't think many are as eloquent as this.  Topping off the tale are Perkins' adept illustrations as well.  Anyone who has seen a cat in pain will recognize how well the author/illustrator has captured this feline's tightly squeezed eyes and flat ears.  At times the pictures slip into a kind of dreamscape.  A page quartered into four views of the boy and cat in bed look out on stars, an evening meadow, a misty night, and sunny green field.  Other times, there's a nice melding between the text and the pictures.  I was especially taken with the title page, on which the portrait of the boy's mother as a girl, pets the cat held by the boy in an opposite portrait.  It's a great story with likable characters and an interesting plot.  And to top it all off, it serves a need.  Simply great.trait.

Using 4\\" x 5 \\" and 8\\" x 10\\" view cameras, photographer Walter Wick has done what many would have thought was well nigh impossible.  He has systematically photographed some of the world's best known optical illusions.  Happen to like the M.C. Escher print where people walk up stairs to a balcony equal in height as to where they started?  It's in here.  How about cubes whose arms twist in depth defying ways?  In here too.  Walter Wick is best known for his I Spy book series.  With this book, however, he has created a series of amazing oracular photographs that are just as interesting to figure out as they are to look at.  Fortunately for the reader, Wicks has included short explanations of how some tricks work and how others fool the eye.  He explains how he created his photographs and why some of them work as well as they do.  For any child (or, heck, adult) interested in some true to life optical illusions, this is the best book on the market today.  But bear in mind, even when Wick's explanations are said and done, some of these photos bear some going over.  I, personally, had to read the following sentence five times: \\"The balcony is attached to the arches in the foreground, but the top of the foreground archway is cut at an angle that matches the angle of the walkway's bottom edge\\".  I'll be honest.  I still don't quite know what that means.  So if your kid doesn't mind reading some fairly complex explanations like the one above, this book is ideal reading material.  If they do mind, best that you find them something a little less brain/word twisting.	2004-04-10

Illustrator Barbara Cooney has adapted the \\"Nun's Priest's Tale\\" to picture book format, turning it into a tale that warns against flattery.  I'm just glad she didn't think of adapting \\"The Wife of Bath\\" tale.  Thank goodness for small favors, eh?<br />In this story a widow and her two daughters live by themselves in the countryside.  The focus of the story rests squarely on their cocky (ha ha) rooster Chanticleer.  A bird with a harem (the book flaps description, not mine) of seven hens, Chanticleer has a fairly restive life.  One day, however, a sly fox comes with flattering words and tricks poor Chanticleer into closing his eyes.  It is only through the rooster's quick thinking that he is able to escape the fox and get away.<br />I've never read the original tale, so I'm not certain how this story adds up against it.  Needless to say, I found it a funny amalgamation of several Aesop stories.  Flattery was always utilized by Aesop in ways similar to this tale.  In fact, Chanticleer's escape from the fox is nothing so much as an alternate version of the old story about the fox and the crow with a hunk of cheese.  Cooney's illustrations do much to help this tale along.  Using gorgeous pen and ink drawings and selective sections of color, this books at times looks like nothing so much as a collection of cheery Edward Gorey prints.  The tale is quick and clean and I imagine many children will be fond it this particular retelling.  All in all, an enjoyable book.	2004-04-10

Why do the best picture books explaining color involve solely, and with few exceptions, mice?  I mean, just consider Denise Fleming's fantastic \\"Lunch\\" or Ed Young's stunning, \\"Seven Blind Mice\\".  For some reason, mice are just prone to well written color-infused storylines.  \\"Mouse Paint\\" is no different.<br />Three adorable albino mice (able to hide from clever cats by standing on white pieces of paper) come across three jars of pain.  On is red, one is yellow, and one is blue.  Thinking, in a typical mousy fashion, that the jars of paint are Mouse Paint, the three climb in.  Next, they set about dipping their toes in other colors, creating whole new combinations.  Thus, kids learn that when a red mouse does a jig in a puddle of yellow paint, his feet will eventually turn a bright cheery orange.  By the end of the tale, the mice are painting all sorts of colors hither and yon, mixing and matching shades in all sorts of new and exciting ways.<br />The book is made from a series of cut-paper collages.  You wouldn't necessarily know this when looking at it, however.  These mice have verve and pep.  Their puddle dances are lively and entertaining.  There are subtle in-jokes, such as the mice washing themselves clean in a large bowl that reads, \\"CAT\\".  And to top it all off, they're pretty darn cute to boot.  Though I've seen good books explaining colors to kids, this is the best I've seen that explains how to create a new color out of the combination of two others.  All in all, it's a good read and an entertaining one as well.	2004-04-10

Like \\"Frog\\", this is a picture book based on a classic folk song.  It is simultaneously a counting tale as a well as one of the first cutsie baby animal books published in the United States (origianally published in 1957).  A lovely look at the creatures in the fields, though not particularly memorable.<br />In this tale we get an opening shot of a myriad of creatures sitting, standing, or perching in the light of the meadow.  As the song progresses a turtle asks her single offspring to dig, and he does so.  Then a fox tells her two cubs to run, and they follow her suggestion.  This continues, with each animal accruing more and more offspring, instructing them in different ways.  The robins sing, the chipmunks play, the bees hum, etc.  Finally, after the ten rabbits hop, we get this double page spread that is downright out of place.  Suddenly it is night and an owl and a fox are out looking for prey as bunnies and gophers run for their lives.  It is a beautiful and deeply evocative scene that has virtually nothing to do with the rest of the book.  Then the book is over, with the exception of some helpful music sheets and chords for playing the song's tune.<br />John Langstaff hasn't done much to put his name on the tale, aside from breaking up the verses.  It is really Feodor Rojankovsky's impressive illustrations that place this book apart from others.  Alternating between the colorful and the subtly shaded, Rojankovsky adeptly portrays every animal from bird to bee.  It's a nice effort and a nice book.  Just the same, if you'd really like to see Langstaff and Rojankovsky at their best, I highly recommend the Caldecott winning, \\"Frog Went A Courtin'\\" for all your picture book needs.	2004-04-10

A story that combines the traditional Christmas tale of the birth of Christ with the modern day desire to give presents around that time of the year.  The Italians are on the ball when it comes to tying such divergent activities together, and Ilse Plume's \\"The Christmas Witch\\", shows us how.  No large North Pole dwelling elf for Italian children.  They've their very own gift giving witch (complete with invisibility and magic powers too!).<br />In this classic story, we learn of Befana.  Once this woman lived in the hills of Italy, healing the sick and telling fortunes.  One day, while bringing in some wood, she came across the Three Wise Men.  The Three told Befana of the birth of Christ and she begged to come along.  Unfortunately, by the time she'd hauled her wood back to her home and returned to follow, the men were gone.  Nonplussed, Befana locates a bag of toys she would give and treks off to find Christ herself.  For years and years she traveled, never finding him until one day she was given the job of giving away presents to every child in whom the spirit of Christ lives.  Batta bing batta boom, the yearly Christmas witch.  Like Santa, she prefers to give coal to naughty children.  Unlike Santa, there's a real connection between her penchant for gift giving, and the religious subtext of the season.<br />The book itself is fun.  But while the story is great, the illustrations suffer.  A bit flat, they contain a certain 2-dimensional cartoonish feel.  Just the same, there's a lot to love in this story.  I was particularly taken with how a religious figure like Befana can be a devout Christian and, at the same time, a witch.  Take that Harry Potter haters!  This would be a particularly good book to read to the kiddies around the Yuletide.  It combines a known figure (the person who gives them mysterious X-mas goodies) with an unknown figure (Befana herself).  A great read and an interesting story.  Parents will find themselves learning just as much as their children, I'll warrant.their children, I'll warrant.	2004-04-10

Now that's a pretty negative opening comment about a book that is, all in all, an amusing story about a man and his eclectic dog.  And I'm not saying that this book is THE worst Caldecott winner to have ever existed.  That honor belongs to the ludicrously racist and factually inaccurate \\"Abraham Lincoln\\" by the Parin d'Aulaires.  Certainly this is a nice little tale about safety, and it presents actual important safety tips in a fun and original manner.  But it's hardly deserving of a medal.  Hardly.<br />In this tale, Officer Buckle finds that his school safety tips are being met with more than a little disregard on the part of the students.  Kids are just snoring in the aisles when Buckle reads the list of tips.  All that changes when the Officer acquires a police dog named Gloria.  Suddenly the kids are wide-awake for Buckle's safety demos, and it's no wonder.  Gloria is faithfully acting out each and every safety tip as her owner reads them out.  From \\"Never leave a thumbtack where you might sit on it\\" to \\"Do not go swimming during electrical storms\\".  Of course, Officer Buckle has no clue why there has been such a rise in his own popularity.  But when watching a taped recording of his own program, the law enforcement agent must decide whether or not he is of any real importance to the community, or if it's all Gloria's glory.<br />There's a lot to love in this story.  Rathmann has fitted many a scene with tiny interesting details.  Buckle fans (as well as the Officer himself) sport anti-banana peel badges and t-shirts.  Officer Buckle's book collection (containing such titles as \\"You Can't Be Too Careful\\" and \\"Safety in Numbers\\") is held together by Gloria shaped book-ends.  And check out Buckle's final safety tip written in front of him while angrily refusing to do anymore speeches (#100: Never turn your back on a strange dog).  The plot is cute as well.  It's nice to see an energetic dog in the vein of Snoopy or Mark Teague's Ike that's female for once.  And there is a real affection between Buckle and his trusty canine friend.  I think back to the scene of the policeman feeding Gloria an ice cream cone after she's given a stint of autographs to waiting fans.  Finally, there's no denying that Buckle has come up with some really good safety tips.  The front and end papers of this book show some useful stars containing Gloria acting out why one should or should not follow such n' such a tip.<br />Now when I said the book didn't deserve the Caldecott, I meant it.  It's a swell book with a fun story and lovely pictures.  But it's not superb.  I can only assume it won solely on the basis that it is the only Caldecott book to discuss safety in any serious manner.  And it does so without causing undue fear or worry on the part of the small child reader.  Which is good.  So by all means, go out and read this nice little story.  Just don't expect to be blown away by its wit or depth.ic dog in the vein of Snoopy or Mark Teague's Ike that's female for once.

And may I say, how pleasant it is to read you once again.  I know it's been at least 20 years since I was but a wee tot on my mother's knee.  She would read \\"The Amazing Bone\\" to me time and time again, and I really did find it a delightful story.  Now, years and years later, I read it again.  There's something about a good Steig book.  And to me, this is the most evocative of his stories.  Oh, there are people firmly devoted to \\"Sylvester and the Magic Pebble\\".  And I daresay \\"Shrek\\" and \\"Doctor De Soto\\" have their fans as well.  But give me \\"The Amazing Bone\\" over these trifles any day.  It's a warm ribald thoroughly satisfying tale of a young pig, a talking bone, and the troubles that ensue.<br />Pearl is a sweet young pig winding her way home one day.  Enjoying the people around her, the clean crisp air, and the softness of the flowered glens, Pearl is a bit like Little Red Riding Hood.  She is in no particular hurry to get home.  When Pearl stumbles across a magical talking bone, she is delighted.  The bone too is quite happy and the two make a delicious pair.  When robbers (frightfully dressed in scary masks and carrying guns & knives) attempt to rob little Pearl, the bone successfully drives the bandits off with scary sounds.  Some parents find this an inappropriate portion of the tale and will make a very big deal about it.  Honestly?  It's just a little too weird to seriously freak out a child.  I daresay parents are the ones frightened by this part of the book.  Not kiddies.  Continuing in the story a dapper fox is less gullible than the silly robbers.  When he decides to make Pearl his meal, the bone's cries are in vain.  It is only through a series of fortunate turns of fate that Pearl and her bone may return safe and sound to her home and her parents.<br />Don't get me wrong.  The story is doggone bizarre.  One of Steig's weirdest by far.  Steig was a fan of the small common object (bone, pebble, etc.) containing great grandiose powers.  His stories often focus on the little fellow outwitting the big (sometimes literally).  And foxes were his favorite villains.  Often elegantly dressed, they have the capacity for pity.  They just ignore it. This particular story is especially disturbing because of the nature of Pearl's abduction.  The fox forces her into his abandoned shack, leaving her cowering on the floor of a room.  Want to drill into your children the horrors of strangers and the dangers of going anywhere with them?  I can't think of a better method of getting this point home (though, admittedly, I don't remember getting that message when I myself read this story as a child).  Though the book certainly contains creepy possibilities, the story is a good one.  You're safe with Steig. And just a word on the beauty of his illustrations.  Though Steig obviously preferred to grow messier and squigglier in his creations as he aged, no scene in children's picture books is more perfectly pastoral than the shot of Pearl reclining amongst the flowering trees and fields.  All in all, a great story couched in a great book.iose powers.  His stories often focus on the little fellow outwitting the big (sometimes literally).  And foxes were his favorite villains.

The old, if-one-more-person-gets-into-this-boat/mitten/car/etc.-bad-things-will-happen genre.  Jan Brett's \\"The Mitten\\" does it.  The more recent \\"One Dog Canoe\\" does it.  But one of the first stories to have done it (and have a moral to boot) is the 1970 story \\"Mr. Gumpy's Outing\\".<br />Mr. Gumpy (who is not grumpy in the least) lives on the banks of a river, and owns a boat.  As he goes for a boat ride, two children ask to come along.  Mr. Gumpy gives them instructions on what not to do, and they join him.  Next a bunny comes along.  Mr. Gumpy tells it what not to do, and it joins him.  As Mr. Gumpy poles his boat down the river, more and more animals join the party, each receiving a stipulation from Mr. Gumpy on what behavior is appropriate.  After the boat fills, the animals suddenly ignore Mr. Gumpy's requests and begin to misbehave.  As a result, they all topple headlong into the river, retiring to Gumpy's for tea.<br />Originally published in England (and if Mr. Gumpy isn't THE most English picture book gentleman you've seen outside of Paddington Bear himself, I'll eat my hat) the story is incredibly civilized.  There's nothing like seeing a sheep delicately sipping from a straw to drill home the essential manners and protocols essential to everyday interactions.  The illustrations are especially nice.  Mr. Gumpy never looks particularly upset or angry by anything that happens to him.  As he poles his boat a black and white pen and ink drawing on the left pages shows the boat and it's inhabitants.  On the right page is a colorful drawing of the animal(s) asking to be allowed to join.  The book, despite the whole falling into the water bit, is calm and peaceful.  Just the kind of fun story you'd expect to be read on a cold rainy day.  Highly recommended (especially with crumpets and bit of toast with marmalade).	2004-04-07

Have you ever tried to locate a list of books, fiction or non-fiction, that deals with Somalia but is written for young 'uns?  Try it sometime.  I guarantee you won't be able to find more than three.  Four tops.  And why is this?  Somalians are some of the most interesting people living in the world today.  They're fascinating people.  Yet the spell checker on my laptop computer doesn't even RECOGNIZE the word Somalian.  I've lived in Minneapolis, Minnesota where the Somalia immigrants are a wonderful addition to the previously white bread Minnesotan population.  Wanting to find out if my local library had anything about Somalians for kids, I was able to locate only this book on the topic.  And boy oh boy does it illustrate how dire the need is for this kind of literature.<br /><br />First of all, this book is, without a doubt, solely intended to be used for 5th grade research projects.  Author Mary Virginia Fox has written several books in this \\"Enchantment of the World\\" series, and I can only hope she's imbued a little more life and verve into the other books she's written.  On opening the book, we are never given a map of just Somalia.  Rather, we have to hunt and peck to locate it on the Rand McNally provided atlas that shows some of the nine or ten countries located in Western Africa.  If you prefer to look at a map of just Somalia, there's a tiny colored one at the back of the book.  The book then leaps immediately into Somalia facts, not even pausing to have some sort of an introduction or briefing on why Somalia is interesting.  The facts the book presents must be accurate, but we are seriously hindered from using the book's sources because ZERO sources appear credited at any time.  Where the heck is Fox's bibliography?  The closest she comes to crediting anyone is a brief mention of Robert F. Gorman, the Professor of Political Science at Southwest Texas State University.  Surely she opened an encyclopedia once in a while to get these numbers, but no such credit exists.  Bad, Mary Virginia Fox!  Bad!<br />On the other hand, Fox wins points for the beautiful color pictures sprinkled throughout the text.  The reading can be interesting, though at times it drags under the weight of the fact upon fact.  The history section regarding colonialism (a section that should, by its very subject matter at least, be interesting) is dull dull, deathly deadly dull.  Also, Fox isn't a fan of explaining anything.  For example, she might say, \\"In spite of their extensive coastline, Somalis traditionally dislike fish and disdain people who eat fish\\".  Interesting.  Why do Somalis dislike it?  Well, we'll never know because Fox offers no backup information on the topic.  Though great on the straightforward info, don't come running to this book if you want any interesting reasons behind why such n' such is true or false.  Fox is at her best when discussing more recent events in Somalia, and what the UN should have done to cease the fighting.  Then too, there's a helpful section of general information, a timeline, important people to know, and an index in the back.  There are undoubtedly better books about Somalia out there, written with kids or young adults in mind.  If you find any, grab ahold of them with both hands and don't let go.  The alternative is books like this one.  Very good on facts, to be sure.  But skimpy in its presentation altogether.west Texas State University.

Why are children in school encouraged to read \\"The Chocolate War\\" but not the latest Lurlene McDaniel?  Usually the reason is because the writing in a good YA novel is superior to its competitors.  But to make a harrowing story not only poignant but memorable, there has to be that one extra element.  In \\"Speak\\", the extra element is humor.  Author Laurie Halse Anderson has taken a painful life-changing moment of horror and imbued its subject with a sardonic sarcastic wit.  As a result, I was able to not only read this story all the way through (I have trouble reading painful books sometimes) but enjoy it and look forward to picking it up again.<br />Melinda is beginning her high school career as the official outcast.  Over the summer Melinda dared to call the cops to a kick-ass party being held and now all the kids she has ever been friends with have abandoned her.  On top of that, there's a secret Melinda's harboring that threatens to destroy her from the inside out.  Only her sympathetic art teacher, Mr. Freeman, gives Melinda any direction or support she so clearly lacks from both her home and school life.<br />In some ways, I was a little disappointed that Anderson chose to make it so obvious that this book was tailor made to be read and reread by kids in high school English classes.  For example, Melinda discusses a day in which her English teacher (deemed Hairwoman for a badly neglected dye job) attempts to teach the class about symbolism.  Melinda thinks symbolism is kinda cool, and likes finding examples of it in \\"The Scarlet Letter\\".  It's a good thing Melinda likes symbolism too because this book is OVERFLOWING with it.  A few examples: The weather outside vs. Melinda's internal changes.  The name of her favorite teacher is Mr. Freeman.  The tree she works on in art class.  And so on.  The nice thing about this use of symbolism is that Anderson never makes it too too blatantly obvious, or runs it into the ground.  Rather, the teen reading this book might pick up on it on their own and think it was an intelligent thing to have spotted.<br />But as I said before, humor is real breakthrough factor in this story.  Melinda is funny funny funny.  Even when she in the darkest deepest depths of despair, she has the ability to point out what's what.  One of the best of the book's motifs is the school's constantly changing mascot.  The school changes from the Trojans to the Devils because of the condom association.  Then they change from the Devils to the Tigers because of the Satan association.  Then they change from the Tigers to the Wombats because of the animal rights association.  Then they change from the Wombats to the Hornets because they don't want to be associated with foreign marsupials.  Finally they attempt to no longer be the Hornets because the cheerleaders have started a cheer that goes roughly along the lines of...<br /> \\"We are the Hornets,<br /> Horny, Horny, Hornets!<br /> Everywhere we go-oh,<br /> People want to kno-oow,<br /> Who we are, so we tell them . . .<br /> We are the Hornets,<br /> Horny, Horny, Hornets!<br /> (and on and on and on)\\"<br />This is funny stuff.  And real.  Goodness me is the stuff in this book real.  Admittedly, I can't imagine someone like Melinda existing in my own high school.  The idea that an ENTIRE high school could blackball you for a party that (I guarantee you the uncool kids wouldn't have attended) you broke up is a bit of a stretch.  But the teachers, parents, and other incompetents in this book are presented in a well-wrought light.  You like Melinda too.  You sympathize with her completely.

My oh my how she worries. It's amazing the girl can even get out of bed in the morning, she's so wracked with worries morning, noon, and night. She doesn't take the advice of her grandmother half as much as she should. Her grandmother (a sweatshirt wearing, roller-blade enjoying, high-tops sports shoe figure) is constantly advising Wemberly that she is carrying, &quot;Too much worry&quot;. And on top of everything Wemberly is about to go to school for the first time. Rest assured that by the end of the tale, Wemberly's worries have at last been put to rest.<br /><br /> I've always liked Kevin Henkes's portrayal of fathers in his picture books. I like his other characters as well, of course, but Henkes just has dad's down pat. Take a gander at the dad in &quot;Wemberly Worried&quot; for example. Here's a nice pot-bellied father mouse (usually seen in close conjunction with the mother mouse) wearing different colored vests and striped shirts. Be sure to spot the special Halloween bat vest he sports as well! He's great. And so is the book.<br /><br /> Fans of Henkes's other mouse based picture books won't be disappointed with this one. The clever child might even locate a disguised Lily and little brother Julius (two of Henkes's best creations) hidden in one the pages. This book is a good choice for the child that shows a little reluctance towards that first day of school. Though Lily finds her solution through a similar friend, there are other ways of dealing with scary times in school. Be sure to pair this book with other first-day-of-school stories for a well-rounded view of that undoubtedly worrying time.	2004-04-06

There are lots of contenders for the title; from the definite rip-off Charlie Bone series to the sly slightly evil Artemis Fowl.  Personally, I've read a great deal of these and none really hit me as having the same moral core or elaborate well-constructed world that the Potter books conjure up.  Until now, that is.  With \\"Mortal Engines\\", the first in author Philip Reeve's \\"Hungry City Chronicles\\" we have the privilege of finally reading about a world that is just as creative, enjoyable, and exciting as anything J.K. Rowling could ever have imagined.<br />It is the future, and the world is not as it was.  After humanity almost destroyed itself entirely in what became known as the Sixty-Minute War, civilizations have taken it upon themselves to become mobile.  Cities, townships, and even suburbs now move across the land, eating anything smaller than themselves.  This system is referred to as Municipal Darwinism with the strong eating the weak.  The city of London is a particularly vicious devourer of smaller villages and it is here that we meet Tom.  A young Historian, Tom idolizes the famed Historian and explorer Thaddeus Valentine and his lovely daughter Katherine.  When Tom narrowly keeps a severely deformed girl from assassinating Valentine, he finds himself wound up in a series of betrayals and adventures that may well lead to the end of civilization once more.<br />The book is filled to the brim with interesting characters.  There Grike, the last survivor of the old world who is more machine than man.  Or Anna Fang, the red clad aviatrix that fights against the moving cities as an Anti-Tractionist.  Or the pirate Chrystler Peavey that commands a posh pirate suburb and dreams of becoming a proper gentleman someday.  You care for these characters, which makes it all the more painful when Reeve decides to kill them off.  I've never read an author so ready to end the lives of his heroes with as much aplomb as Mr. Reeve, though I should've caught on when he killed off my favorite character almost exactly halfway through.  Much like fellow British author Philip Pullman, Reeve has a knack for juggling multiple points of view and storylines without loosing his narrative thread.  And like Pullman his story involves airships and a boy and girl on a quest to (in effect) save the world.  Unlike Pullman, Reeve less interested in the how the characters' actions will affect the universe, and instead will affect their world.<br />I was especially taken with the theme of obsession in this book.  The evil Mayor Chrome, leader of London, is obsessed with making his town reign supreme over the rest of the world.  Hester Shawn, deformed by the blade of Thaddeus Valentine, is obsessed with killing the man who murdered her parents.  And Grike, the man machine that was one of the millions of walking dead soldiers participating in the Sixty-Minute War, is obsessed with a kind of love for Hester Shaw (though he spends much of his time in this book hunting her down to be killed).  It might have been nice to spend a little more time getting to know what the characters' lives were like before this book ever took place.  I ended up wanting to know a lot more about Tom and Hester's families and the lives they lead, but there didn't seem to be enough time to linger over such details.<br />One objection to the American cover of  \\"Mortal Engines\\".  For the most part, the cover is very impressive, showing airships blowing up in front of the structure that is London.  In the corner however are, who I can only assume is supposed to be, Tom and Hester.  Tom is clutching a book, an odd choice since there is no point in the story where a book is important to his character.  Hester, however, is completely wrong.  The book describes her as have a huge gash down her face with a scar splitting her in two.  Her nose is mashed in and she only has one eye.  Now look at the cover.  Apparently the cover artist decided that putting a deformed female would hurt \\"Mortal Engines\\"'s sales.  So instead we've this cute little waif.  Half her face is in shadow, yes, and there is the slightest hint of a scar on her forehead.  But her nose is completely intact and she's smiling cheekily at the camera.  Forgive me, but this is not the death obsessed horribly disfigured often crazed and violent Hester I came to love so much.  Mr. Cover Artist, for shame.<br />The book itself, however, is a delight.  I can't recommend it enough.  Go out, buy it, read it, and tell me that you didn't think it was the greatest addition to the teen literary futuristic canon to come down the pike since \\"The Giver\\".

The rare Halloween children's classic!  Every Halloween seems to bring a rash of holiday centered picture books.  Some are okay and most are simply terrible.  This Halloween, I ask that you consider a story where the word \\"Halloween\\" never even enters the text.  In \\"The Little Old Lady Who Was Not Afraid of Anything\\" we read a story that has all the markings of a classic folktale.<br />As a little old lady makes her way home through a dark and scary forest, she comes across a pair of old shoes that walk all by themselves.  Assuring the shoes that she is not afraid of them, she next comes across a floating pair of pants.  A shirt follows the pants, gloves and hat follow the shirt, and finally a huge scary pumpkin head follows them all.  In the end the brave little old lady finds a use for the floating objects and everyone ends happily.<br />The book conjures up images of other pop culture touchstones where clothing floats all of its own accord.  The well-known \\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\\" for example.  And like \\"Bedknobs\\", the clothes in this story are definitely malevolent.  Stalking the nice old lady through the woods, each article has its own specific sounds.  The boots go \\"CLOMP CLOMP CLOMP\\", the shirt goes, \\"SHAKE SHAKE\\", and the pants (for reasons best left to the author) go, \\"WIGGLE WIGGLE\\".  As the number of objects increase, the number of sounds increase as well.  A good oral reading of this story will give each sound a scary touch to drill the point home.  The illustrations accompanying the story are rather nice.  They are equally adept at displaying the old lady's grey skied country home as they are the dark bleak autumnal night where she meets the frightening accoutrements.  It's a great story with a rousing plot.  Anyone familiar with fall in the countryside (and anyone who just loves Halloween in general) will enjoy this great old-fashioned book.	2004-03-31

They are malicious (Count Olaf), benign (Uncle Monty), or useless (Aunt Josephine).  In this particular book we meet the ineffectual Aunt Josephine, the third of the Baudelaire's guardians and, perhaps, the most useless of them all.  I mean, certainly it is unfortunate that Count Olaf was their first, and continually follows them from home to home, always wearing disguises.  But he was not useless.  In fact, he moves the plots along quite nicely.<br />In \\"The Wide Window\\", the unfortunate three have landed on the shores of Lake Lachrymose (lachrymose here meaning, \\"given to tears or weeping\\", as I am sure the children were feeling at that moment).  They have been placed in the care of Aunt Josephine, a woman afraid of everything.  Still, this new home is not too too bleak.  The children have a large library to go through (albeit a library full of grammar books) and things appear to be going fairly smoothly until they run across their nemesis Count Olaf yet again.  This time, he is disguised as Captain Sham (love the name) and his new plans to get his hands on the orphans is just as devious as ever.<br />For vocabulary reasons alone these books are a wonder.  Any parent reading them to their children would do well to explain all the little in-jokes that appear along the way (always assuming that the adults themselves GET the jokes in the first place).  This book also is one of the first Baudelaire sagas in which the orphans actually see their guardian dispatched before their very eyes.  Of course, you can't feel too badly about Aunt Josephine's death.  She did attempt to sacrifice the orphans' lives for her own, in an act of cowardice that doomed her to death by (ugh) leeches.  All in all, a wonderful continuation of A Series of Unfortunate Events.	2004-03-31

Author Pete Hautman has over the years been slowly but surely making a name for himself amongst the juveniles and teens of the world.  In this tale written long before the haunting \\"Mr. Was\\" and National Book Award winning, \\"Godless\\", Hautman takes a classic idea (a plague destroys most of the population of the world) and gives it a couple fancy twists.  The book remains relatively unknown, but with Hautman's growing reputation that may not be the case for long.<br /><br />Split into four parts amongst four young protagonists, this is a story about the end of an old world, and the birth of a new.  The bulk of the narration in this tale is given to Ceej.  Living with his sister and his uncle just beside the Grand Canyon, Ceej gets occasional visits from his friend Tim and Tim's father.  The book is occasionally interrupted by small passages from \\"A Recent History of the Human Race\\" (copyright 2038) which helpfully explains how the plague started and how life after its appearance adjusted accordingly.  This is lovely conceit and saves the narrators from explaining details that they themselves wouldn't realistically be discussing with the reader.  When Ceej's uncle and Tim's father decide to take a trip to a nearby dam so as to prevent a natural disaster, the two go missing.  Logically, it's up to our intrepid heroes to try and save them.  And the most perilous danger facing these hardy teens is a band of survivors of the flu (which renders anyone who's lived through it hairless and slightly altered) called the Kinka who've become a dangerous and violent cult, threatening our heroes' actions at every turn.<br /><br />The plot that I have just described is a really good one.  There's a lot of well thought out details involved and I was delighted to find myself really enjoying it just about until we meet the Hopi girl.  Suddenly the book swerves from science fiction into fantasy.  Ceej and Tim run across Bella, a girl in the woods who's been surviving on her own with little effort.  Bella is searching for the Sipapuni a (and I'm quoting the book's jacket on this one), \\"mystical portal that the Hopi believe leads to another world\\".  That's all fine n' dandy, but I found the character of Bella somewhat stereotypical and needless.  She could have been an excellent foil for the other characters.  Instead, she's rendered rather two-dimensional.  Bella has lived much of her life as any normal kid.  Yet when we meet her in the story she seems, amongst other things, incapable of conjunctions.  While most of the characters speak without affectation, Bella has a halting overly formal speech that just rubbed me the wrong way.  On top of that, she's a guide to the Sipapuni, a master of healing, has a way with animals, and speaks regularly with her grandfather (deceased).  You just want to ask Hautman why he decided to write such a stiff caricature of a Native American.  Why didn't he let Bella be a realistic person?  Why is she placed in that long tradition of stereotypical \\"wise Indian\\" parts that have been around as long as \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\"?  I found Hautman's choice to display Bella in this way needless.  But hey.  That's just me.<br /><br />Apart from Bella, the writing falters when our characters start concentrating on the mystical Sipapuni; a land without disease.  Harryette, Ceej's sister, is a deaf mute and a survivor of the disease.  Hautman makes numerous references to the fact that Harryette can't hear things going on.  Fast forward to the end of the story where Harryette twice miraculously recovers her hearing.  Is this a miracle of desert life?  No, it's the book momentarily forgetting that Harryette is deaf.  Hence Harryette, \\"Faintly, in the distance\\", heard Bella cough.  Later when Harryette and Tim are climbing down a steep crevice, \\"A few minutes later I heard his voice\\".  Sloppy writing, heck.  Sloppy editing.  On top of that we've the suddenlyfantastical element of the Sipapuni, standing at odds with the wonderfully science-fictionist feel of the rest of the book.<br /><br />The finale of this story is open-ended, which is fine.  It does certainly stare you in the face and seem to scream \\"SEQUEL!!!\\" in your ear, but so far fans of the book have been disappointed in that respect.  As it is, it stands well enough on its own.  On the whole, it's a fun book.  I just wish it could have been rewritten a little to avoid mistakes, stereotypes, and shifts in genre.  But if you're looking for a great tale of future woe, you could not do much better than this story.<br /><br />This is the review (with some minor changes) as I wrote it way back in March of 2004.  In 2005 author Paul Hautman contacted me and let me know that I'd been a bit on the sloppy side and had screwed up my facts about the book.  I print his points on the matter here.  If you would like a balanced view of \\"A Hole In the Sky\\", then please read Mr. Hautman's counterpoints as follow.  When I write that the book conveniently forgets that Harrryette is without hearing, Mr. Hautman writes that:<br /><br />\\"Harryette is not deaf, a point which is made clear (to most readers) earlier in the book.  She hears just fine, but she is unable to process language--a condition well-known to medical science.  I never suggest that Harryette 'can't hear things going on'\\".<br /><br />To my point that the book switches gears from science fiction to fantasy, Mr. Hautman writes:<br /><br />\\"There are no fantasy elements in this book.  You have chosen to interpret the Sipapuni as fantasy.  It is not.  The Sipapuni is a real place, sacred to modern Hopi, many of whom still believe that it is--or once was--a portal to another world.  Understand that all four POV characters in 'Hole' are unreliable narrators.  Just because a character believes something fantastical does not make a book a 'fantasy.'   I would call the book straightforward science fiction with a suggestion of mysticism\\".<br /><br />In response to Mr. Hautman's points I suggested that I add his rebuttal to this review, which I have.  I hope that this will give the readers a view of \\"Hole In the Sky\\" that they might not have gotten otherwise.  Whether you love the book or hate it, I think that it should be clear from this review that this is a book worth discussing with others.

The painful story of one boy's steadfast refusal to sell chocolates for his high school, and the consequences he faces for such a decision is as brilliant and difficult to read as ever.  This isn't to say that the book is difficult to read stylistically.  Instead, it's a well written tour de force that slyly invites the reader to know more about the characters, even as the situations described grow worse and worse.<br />Cormier is to be commended for creating one of the world's first young adult psychological thrillers.  Though the end of the book does disintegrate into needless violence, most of this story concerns mental anguishes and locked horns as characters vie for superiority over their fellows without fisticuffs.  There's some interest in figuring out who the book's protagonist is too.  Our sympathies lie, of course, with poor Jerry Renault.  Here's the single man poised to challenge the universe around him.  Then there's Archie Costello.  Leader of the school's secret society and an interesting portrait of someone both evil and amazingly confident he works his hardest to bring Renault down.  Both boys (men?) fight.  One for what he believes is right, and the other for his own selfish desires.  In the end, it is difficult to accept that the man who has ended up on top is entirely less deserving.<br />The book's downbeat ending, in which our hero declares that it is never wise to buck the system, has always brought the book under a certain amount of fire.  Adults who read this book find themselves trying to shield it from their own kids.  Which is, of course, patently ridiculous.  Any kid who has ever attended activities with others their own age will instantly recognize the fear and intimidation their peers can inspire.  The book's excellent understanding of how large groups of people will stay silent when one of them is being persecuted, because none of them want to be singled out, is drilled home in the story's final climactic boxing match.  Better still, Cormier truly explores the nature of violence in every human being.  Archie understands it, and sets up a situation where the kids of the school participate in something akin to the gladiator fights of ancient Rome.  The final atrocity Archie manages to perpetuate against Jerry is that he makes the kid himself want to taste blood.  To give in to the violence around him.  It's heartbreaking and amazingly well written.<br />The fact that there's a sequel to \\"The Chocolate War\\" depresses me on some level.  This is one book I really felt stood on its own.  We can imagine the repercussions that occur later well enough without having to rely on a continuation of some sort.  Either the sequel will simply establish the first book's moral (disturbing the status quo may well kill you) or it will trump everything the first book ever proposed (now the good guys win and the bad guys suffer).  In any case, \\"The Chocolate War\\" is well worth reading.  Painful reading, yes.  Sometimes difficult and sometimes unsentimental.  I myself am going to go curl up with \\"Charlotte's Web\\" to get the taste of the book out of my mouth.  But every kid in the world should read it.

Scanning the shelves of your local library you'll find one or two of that specific genre.  But how many picture books are historical looks at girls playing sports?  Few.  And how many cite specific historical characters, like the legendary African-American baseball player Josh Gibson?  Fewer.  Definitely fewer.  Finally, how many are worth reading to your kids over and over, filled with impressive pastel illustrations?  Very few indeed.<br />Enter \\"Just Like Josh Gibson\\".  Another worthy picture book from the multi-talented and remarkably gifted Angela Johnson.  Book editors like to pair Johnson with an array of different illustrators, and it is just our luck that the one chosen for this particular book is the multi-talented Beth Peck.  The story is told by a grandmother to her granddaughter about her baseball playing past.  Here we see the grandmother as a skinny black child in a long pink dress.  Taught to play baseball by her father she's a natural at the game.  The balls she hits soar out of sight, though those watching her chant to themselves, \\"But too bad she's a girl... Too bad she's a girl...\\".  The girl's chance comes at last when one of the boys, her cousin Danny, on a local baseball team hurts his arm.  Changing into her cousin's shoes (pink dress still firmly in place), she wins the game and remembers years later how good it felt to hear the cheers while stealing home.  The book ends with a historical note about the legendary Josh Gibson (a player that the Grandmother always idolized) as well as additional information (well cited) about the role of women in the game.  I was especially interested in learning that a woman once played in the Negro Leagues when slugger Hand Aaron left to join the Braves.  But as the book itself points out, \\"the gender barrier to the `big leagues' still exists\\".  It's refreshing to read a book that identifies and decries an inequality that exists to this very day.  Few books written for adults make such charges, let alone picture books for kids.<br />Accompanying Johnson's narration are Peck's pastels.  Set against a backdrop of stark houses and outhouses, the pictures are beautiful.  One picture in particular caught my attention.  There's a moment where the little girl has swung her baseball bat and is looking off into the distance with the catcher and the umpire as it soars.  Just look at the drawings in this scene.  Peck's careful use of lines slash and cut to make the girl's dress appear to have folds, stretched fabric, and momentum as well.  Now that's just good drawing.<br />In the end, I suspect \\"Just Like Josh Gibson\\" will be relegated to the pile of forgotten children's classics someday.  But if you know any child that loves sports, and baseball in particular, I urge you pick up this book.  It does more to advance the cause of women in sports for little children than anything else I've read in a long time.w books written for adults make such charges, let alone picture books for kids.  <br />Accompanying Johnson's narration are Peck's pastels.

It is the rare children's book that instantly greets you with a pure black page.  The word CREATION stands out like granite against the dark.  Reading through the story, author Gerald McDermott has drawn this telling primarily from Genesis 1:1 through 2:3 of the Hebrew Bible.  Mentioning this in an opening author's note he goes on to explain how he used handmade mulberry-bark paper to create the beautifully colored papers found within.<br />The book is an unapologetic recreation of the Creation story, told in the Judeo-Christian tradition.  The narration is from the point of view of God, it seems.  The opening reads, \\"I was before time.  I was everywhere.  There was nothing.  I was there.  My spirit moved over the deep.  I floated in darkness\\".  The text by and large continues in this vein.  The narrator separates light from darkness and out of the sea brings forth the earth.  In the end, man and woman are created and the final parting shot is of a single human baby floating in a circle of red with the words, \\"I am all this.  All this I am\\".  There is no fall in this picture book.  No serpent and no tree of life.  As such, it is a surprisingly satisfying retelling.<br />The text is good, yes yes.  But the pictures... oh the pictures.  My gut reaction is something along the lines of, \\"McDermott wuz ROBBED of a Caldecott.  Robbed I sayz!\\".  This is an incredibly lovely concoction.  Colorful doesn't even begin to describe it.  From the deep greens and blues of the seas brimming with creatures to the bright and colorful birds of the sky, one is easily blown away by the depth of the artwork.  Those parents uncomfortable with reading a Christian based story to their little ones, take heart.  You could easily show how this book is a tight encapsulation of evolution as well.<br /> McDermott has this to say of his book: \\"As in all of my work, Creation is an outer expression of the inner reality that connects every human soul\\".  Enough said.soul\\".  Enough said.	2004-03-27

Today, this is not the case.  The story of the frog dandy and his lovely rodent bride is no longer sung half so much as it once was.  What is to blame for this strange turn of fortune?  Interspecies dating fears?  A loathsome repugnance to frog songs?  I have no idea.  Just the same, it's a delight to think that books like the 1956 Caldecott winning \\"Frog Went A-Courtin'\\" can carry on the song's tradition, regardless of how often it is sung today.<br />In a respectful author's note at the beginning, writer John Langstaff explains the origins of the song.  Transposed from Scotland to America (there's a wonderful picture of a small yellow frog jumping from one bank entitled \\"Scotland\\" to another bank entitled \\"America\\" accompanying the explanation) the song has changed and grown over the course of many many years.  Langstaff is quick to give credit where credit is due.  Says he, \\"Sometimes the grownups might forget some of the words, and the children would make up words they liked better, and put them in the song\\".  As a result, Langstaff credits the song to the hundreds of adults and children that passed it on to one another.  His version is a combination of these, and perhaps the best possible.  The narration is smooth and the lyrics scan perfectly.  All in all, an enjoyable tale.<br />The illustrations are really what make this tale top notch.  Artist Feodor Rojankovsky paired with Langstaff on a number of different picture books over the years.  In this story, every scene is well thought out and delicate.  The details are brought fully to life through Rojankovsky's adept inks and colored pencils.  The froggy wears shiny black boots with spurs, flipper shaped for his comfort.  Bugs and beetles wear the latest 1955 fashions and gleam blue-black against their surroundings.  Totally aside from the beauty of the illustrations is the fact that every animal in this book is perfectly presented.  You have little doubt that Rojankovsky spent much of his time discovering exactly how many legs a bumblebee has so that he could draw one playing the banjo [just] right.  In a lovely parting shot the mouse and the frog are on a steamer headed for a honeymoon in France.  Froggie has doffed a beret and the two are reclining on the deck, happy as you please.  The book is endlessly charming and entirely too wonderful to ever be forgotten.

For me, reading \\"The Monkey and the Crocodile\\" was particularly eerie.  I felt as if I had read this story in some slightly altered form not too long ago.  It was only when I recalled that this tale is told in Katherine Paterson's, \\"Of Nightingales That Weep\\", that I realized where I'd heard it before.  Truth be told, the tale is much older than even that.  Based on a Jataka tale from India, the story is (according to its Library of Congress heading), \\"A retelling of one of the Indian fables relating to the former births of Buddha in which as a monkey he manages to outwit the crocodile who decides to capture him\\".  No real mention of Buddha is made in this story, however, so it is left up to the reader to make such a connection on his or her own.<br />When a crafty crocodile sets his sights on a tasty monkey in the trees, he tries a variety of methods to eat the furry primate.  Each time, however, the cheeky monkey finds a way to get around being eaten.  In the end, the crocodile admits defeat.  \\"Monkey, I thought I was cunning, but you are much more cunning than I.  And you know no fear.  I will leave you alone after this\\".  The monkey accepts the crocodile's compliment but makes it quite clear that he will be watching out for the crocodile anyway.  The story, being a classic, is good.  Unfortunately, Paul Galdone's illustrations do not live up to the tale.  Though the crocodiles are particularly fun to look at, the monkeys are not very well drawn.  You can feel a threat emanating from the pictures of the slick green reptiles, whereas the monkeys are rather cartoonish and sloppily illustrated.  While a good story, a better illustrator could take this tale to an entirely different level.  On the whole, it's a pity the book hasn't better pictures.  But for an excellent collection of mean looking crocs, go no further than this.	2004-03-27

I became interested in reading this book after it won prize upon prize upon award in 2003 and 2004.  The book effectively straddles the line between young adult and adult fiction and has accrued praise from both age groups.  So I picked it up, read it, and can now faithfully say that it is unlike any other book I have read before.  Books about various mental illnesses and problems abound in the world.  This, however, is the first book I have ever read that places the viewer squarely in the head of a boy quite like Christopher. A fifteen-year-old autistic boy.<br />Christopher lives will his father in Swindon, England.  His life is very comfortable and he is looking forward to taking his A-level maths soon.  Fifteen is a young age to be taking such a test, but Christopher is particularly good at math and physics.  Being autistic he has difficulty understanding other people and understanding their emotions and intents.  When Christopher finds his neighbor's dog dead, he decides to do some detective work ala his hero Sherlock Holmes.  What Christopher doesn't understand, however, is that though he may believe himself to be similar to Sherlock, he cannot deny his own emotions when the mystery comes shockingly close to home.<br />I do not know much about autistic persons.  So in truth, I can't say whether or not this book is particularly accurate in its depiction of a fifteen-year-old autistic kid.  What I do know is that Haddon is remarkably sympathetic towards his subject.  The challenge in writing this book was to make Christopher someone you sympathize with, even as he makes incorrect assumptions and violent gestures towards those he loves.  You can see where Christopher is coming from, even as you determine where he makes his mistakes.  This is especially impressive when you consider that Haddon is writing a character that cannot hug, understand love, or figure out how to care for others outside of himself.<br />However, it is the depiction of those who love Christopher that is Haddon's greatest strength.  How rare it is to see things that your narrator cannot see.  To understand where people are coming from even as you see them through the eyes of a boy who is incapable of understanding.  No adult in this book is perfect, but they are all interesting and real.  You comprehend the motivations behind each person's actions.  They are all capable of inappropriate anger and exasperation.  Best of all, the book is incredibly interesting.  Broken up by maps, graphs, equations, pictures, and drawings, the book is continually drawing your eye in a variety of different ways.  It is a wonderful story for anyone into math, but if you are like my pretty self and don't particularly care for sums it is still a wonderful read.

A girl in her class, Olive, has been killed in a car accident.  Though she did not know Martha at all, Olive's mother gives the girl a page from Olive's diary.  In it, we learn that Olive had three wishes, and the last was to become friends with Martha, \\"the nicest person in my whole entire class\\".  Martha is stunned by this discovery, but it's not long before she and her family are going to visit her grandmother on the seashore, and she has little time to ponder this statement.  What transpires is a tale of summer love, shame, understanding, and acceptance.<br />I'm going to state right here and now that this is not a book for the reluctant reader.  Some kids are willing to put a great deal of effort into reading a slow solid story such as this.  But for others, this book's gonna bore them to sleep.  This isn't anyone's fault, least of all author Kevin Henkes.  When you write a story of this nature, you have to chose whether to make it appeal to kids who love to read or kids that need a hook to get them interested.  \\"Olive's Ocean\\" is of the former category.  For the child willing to stick it through, however, there are definite rewards.  Henkes remembers early adolescence eerily well.  Embarrassment is perhaps his most remarkable accomplishment.  I've rarely read an author who can pinpoint shame to such an accurate and alarming degree.  Similarly, the tunnel-vision effects of a first love are given the right amount of depth and respect.  The book attempts to speak of large grand things in a simple narrative style and for the most part it succeeds.  It's hard to find fault with this book, though I admittedly felt it slowed significantly at certain key areas.  Just the same, it's worth a shot.  For those kids that haven't ever had to confront death directly before, this may be just the story to introduce them to that grandest of wild adventures.g degree.

My husband doesn't mind, but neither does he show an inordinate amount of interest in them.  Enter \\"Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel\\".  Suddenly my husband was elated by the appearance of this book.  \\"This was the only book we had in my Kindergarten class!\\", quoth he.  After he'd picked through it once more, I had my chance to glance through the story. Admittedly, I did not know of the adventures of Mike Mulligan or trusty Mary Ann until rather late in life.  But looking at my hubby's gleeful expression on seeing it again, I know that this is one of those classics that sits in the back of the memory for years and years and years.<br />Mike Mulligan (Irish, according to the book flap) runs a delightful steam shovel named Mary Ann.  The opening spread shows Mike waving at the viewer, while meticulous arrows indicate every lever, cog, and line in Mary Ann's hull.  In a rather John Henryish turn of events, Mary Ann is eventually determined to be obsolete in the face of the fancier gasoline, electric and Diesel shovels.  Mike refuses to give up his precious steam shovel, however, and a race to prove that Mary Ann can dig as much in a day as a hundred men can dig in a week explodes in a riveting (ho ho) finish.<br />Books about trucks, construction equipment, and planes is commonplace today.  But such modern day classics as \\"I Stink\\" owe a great debt to the path that \\"Mike Mulligan\\" paved.  Here we have a beautifully illustrated (in color at that!) story about two of the best friends in the world.  Those kids interested in the technical aspects of steam shovels will be in heaven.  And those that just like a rip-roaring yarn about a race against the clock will have a ball as well.  Interestingly, author/illustrator Virginia Lee Burton chooses not to close up on Mike Mulligan's face at any point.  When we do see him, he's usually viewed at a distance, waving, weeping, and smoking to his heart's content.  It's Mary Ann that get the full frontal treatment, and she's a joy.  Who could have thought a steam shovel to be so eloquent and emotional?  That's the joy of this story and the genius of Virginia Lee Burton's masterwork.that get the full frontal treatment, and she's a joy.

Not a lot of the time, it's true, but sometimes.  Reading the cover flap for \\"Lunch\\", the book had this to say (about itself), \\"this is one book about colors that makes the plain old primaries look positively pale\\".  Hrmph, said I.  We shall see.  So I flipped through this picture book, preparing to read the same old same old.  And the fact of the matter is, the book flap was absolutely right.  This book has the two elements absolutely necessary to becoming successful.  It's amazing to look at and it's funny as all get out.<br />A small mouse sniffs curiously out of his hole.  His little arms reach yearningly off to the side.  The little mouse is very hungry.  So he climbs up the nearest black and white checked tablecloth and proceeds to eat every beautifully colored fruit and vegetable he sees.  Beginning with a purple turnip, moving onto an orange carrot, yellow corn, etc.  As the little mouse eats (and his aplomb and enthusiasm is highly addictive) he covers himself more and more with particles of the foods he's just devoured.  By the end of the story the author includes a picture of the now completely multi-colored mouse with helpful notations as to what each item on his person is.  On his tail are green peas, for example.  Reading the artist's statement, I didn't realize right off the bat that just as the mousey's food items change color, so too does the background of each and every scene.  Additionally, the tablecloth itself is a calming black and white, ably setting off the mouse and his gluttonous rampage.<br />When you first hear how artist Denise Fleming went about creating the pictures for this book your initial reaction is something along the lines of, \\"Whaaaa?\\".  Why go to all that bother and work?  I urge you to purchase a hardcover copy of this book (I can't vouch for the paperback) because the book flap goes into incredible detail describing Fleming's incredible process.  Suffice to say, no paint or brushes created a page of art in this book.  Instead, each page is a meticulously hand-crafted process that results in handmade paper with these images intact.  It blows the mind, it does.<br />The rare spectacular picture book is interesting to children, interesting to adults, and manages to sneak in some sort of learning.  \\"Lunch\\", however, doesn't bother with any sneaking.  It blatantly teaches children the names of colors (as well as healthy foods!) and everyone ends up winning.  This book is simply fabulous.  Seriously consider adding it to your collection immediately, if not sooner.no paint or brushes created a page of art in this book.

And even if we haven't, we know the type.  The ancient trickster sprite found in every land around the world is a common creature.  In \\"Puck of Pook's Hill\\", however, Rudyard Kipling establishes Puck as the very soul of England itself.  Using Robin Goodfellow as a guide, Kipling is able to adeptly describe a range of important factors that lead to the glory of late nineteenth-century Britain.  The result is an enchanting story featuring a beloved literary figure.<br />Two children living in England decide to act out a scene from \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\" on Midsummer Night itself in an old fairy ring of darkened grass.  In so doing, the two accidentally conjure up Puck incarnate.  Puck is as old as the land itself, and while all the other fairies and sprites have long left England (all thanks to Henry the VIII, as it happens) he remains.  Over the course of the next months, Puck is able to bring forward figures from the English past to speak with the children and tell them stories.  These figures include a knight carrying a runic sword, a Roman conqueror (born and raised in England), an artist, and a Jewish money lender who is responsible for the signing of the Magna Carta.<br />Admittedly, it would help to have a basic working knowledge of English history when approaching this text.  Know your Saxons from your Normans.  Understand the reasons the Picts hated the Romans (though Kipling is clearly on Rome's side in that struggle).  Other details are easily filled in by the author himself, and Kipling is more than willing to use Puck to fill in gaps and misunderstandings for his readers.  The piece of land the book takes place on was the actual English land that Kipling himself owned at the time.  The modern reader will find a couple usual stereotypes of the era.  Africans are like children, ditto the Picts, and I won't even go into the Chinaman included.  The Jews, by comparison, are shown a great deal of compassion by the author.  Kadmiel (the Jew in question) is an impressive figure that speaks with more nobility than any other figure in the book.  So kudos to Kipling for at least one interesting and three-dimensional minority.  Bravo indeed.<br />Some will find this particular Kipling outing slow going.  I, personally, thought the book was written quite well.  I felt no shudders when I lifted the book up again to peruse it, and despite its deceptively long length it's a quick read.  Anyone who wishes to have a basic working knowledge of fairy doings in merry old England would do very well to give old Kipling a look-see.omparison, are shown a great deal of compassion by the author.

For many, the delightful \\"Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile\\" is a perennial favorite.  I, myself, had never read it before.  When first we see Lyle, he's standing in the center of Central Park (this is most definitely a New York based book) feeding the ducks.  Occupying a swank apartment (you should see his bathroom!) with the Primm family, Lyle is everyone's favorite crocodile.  He's polite, helpful, and wonderful at double dutch.  The ever dour Mr. Grumps next door has problems with the beloved Lyle.  Mr. Grumps continually threatens to send Lyle away, but it isn't until an unfortunate department store incident that Mr. Grumps makes good his threats.  In the end, however, all turns out for the best and Lyle is reunited with his loving family.<br />There's a certain amount of suspension of disbelief involved in this tale.  Apparently it is not a particularly odd thing to live with a crocodile.  I was especially taken with Mrs. Primm's relationship with the lovely reptile.  The two do their shopping together and take a turn about the ice skating rink.  (...)  Mr. Grumps refuses to even speak with Lyle until a fortunate accident towards the book's finale.  And in the end, it's just a lovely book.  The writing is superb.  The illustrations adorable and evocative all at once.  The book has CLASSIC writ large all over it.  If you've any wit or intelligence about you (and you wish to pass such virtues onto your darling children) pick up the wonderful \\"Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile\\" immediately.	2004-03-22

To look at \\"Snow Music\\" you wouldn't necessarily think much of it at first.  On the cover is a calming image of a snow globe sitting beside a snowy window.  Inside the book, however, the author/illustrator Lynne Rae Perkins has created a collection of delicate watercolor pictures that deftly encapsulate the experience of a single snowy day.  When a boy accidentally loses his dog in the snow he sets out to find it again, experiencing the sights and sounds of winter on the way.<br />My description of the plot is exactly the same as millions of plots about snowy days in children's picture books.  There's not a word in that description that's going to convince you that this book is any better or worse.  Well it IS better, gol durn it, and I fully intend to show you why.  First of all, let's examine a two page spread that appears after the title page.  The page is full of blue, purple, and violet circles, each containing the word, \\"peth\\".  The instruction simply reads, \\"Everyone whisper:\\".  A whispered \\"peth\\" is indeed the sound snow makes when it falls on a silent night.  The opposite page is a single spotlight lit on the side of the road, illuminating the flakes that fall beneath it.  As the book continues we read small animal poetry.  One is a deer haiku (almost), the other the thoughts a squirrel may have as it hunts for food.  Two kids meet up and one explains his current situation.  \\"I just opened the door to look out and he bolted\\".  I love this line.  The kids trudge off to find the dog and we read three different kinds of snow music in a row.  One is the sound a car makes when it drives with the radio playing.  Another is a VERY realistic truck salting the road.  The third, the dog jingling in the snow.  As you may have guessed, this dog is eventually found and the last dialogue we hear is this:<br /> \\"Good boy.\\"<br /> \\"Why are you saying he's good?\\"<br /> \\"So he'll like coming home\\".<br />The snow falls again after the sun melted it during the day and we are instructed this time to whisper \\"fep fep fep\\".  End of story.<br />Aside from the words, which are superb, the art is as evocative as it gets.  Perkins lives in northern Michigan and her book is a lovely view of rural Midwest snowscapes in the wintertime.  This is the best picture book I've seen that evokes what it truly feels like to watch snow covering the land during the night.  As lovely to hear as it is to read, it's one of the best winter stories I've ever had the pleasure to pick up.ructed this time to whisper \\"fep fep fep\\".

If you were to walk up to the first person you met on the street and asked, \\"Are you familiar with the works of Mr. Ludwig Bemelmans?\\", you would probably get a funny stare.  If, however, you were to walk up to another person on the street and said, \\"In an old house that was covered with vines lived twelve little girls in two straight lines\\", you might still get a funny stare but at least they might be familiar with darling \\"Madeline\\".  Though its author hasn't received much interest over the years, the Madeline books have garnered a great deal of love from many members of the literary world.  And of these, the only Caldecott winner was \\"Madeline's Rescue\\".<br />Just as they do every day, the little girls attending a French boarding school (run by the pleasant nun Miss Clavel) take a walk across the Seine.  On one day in particular, however, the feisty Madeline (who beyond her near drowning gets short shift in this book) falls into the river and nearly drowns.  Thanks to a plucky mongrel nearby, Madeline lives and the dog is adopted by the school.  To the dismay of the students, however, several trustees coming for an annual inspection are chagrined that such a dog (a mixed-breed undoubtedly) would be allowed to live in one of their schools.  Genevieve (for such is the dog's name) is cruelly turned out into the streets and it's up to the girls to rescue their faithful pup.<br />The book is ostensibly for children, but I suspect it is far more loved by Paris-adoring adults.  As the little girls search for their doggy they walk about a variety of well known Parisien sights.  Here they search amongst the patrons of the trendy Deux Magots.  Yonder you can see them in a breathtaking search across Le Pere-Lachaise.  I ask you, in what other picture book are you likely to see a full quote on Oscar Wilde's tomb (not to mention nods to Chopin, Moliere, Balzac, and more)?  Bemelmans has a lovely lilting ear for his own prose as well.  Just consider the line...<br /> \\"Miss Genevieve, noblest dog in France,<br /> You shall have your VEN-GE-ANCE!\\"<br />You just can't beat it.  On top of that are some wonderful illustrations.  Though most of the book is black on white with yellow, there is always the occasional full page spread that is deftly colored in deep greens and dark blues.  On the whole, there is much to love in this book.

I suspect that no adult that read this book once (and only once) as a child remembers it correctly.  For example, if you had asked me, prior to rereading it, what the plot of \\"Harriet the Spy\\" was, I could have summed it up like so:  Harriet the Spy is about a girl who wants to be a spy.  She spies on lots of different people and writes in a notebook, but one day all her friends read the notebook and none of them like her anymore.  That is the plot of \\"Harriet the Spy\\".  And I would be half right.  Surprising to me, I found I was forgetting much much more.<br />In truth, \\"Harriet the Spy\\" is about class, loss, and being true to one's own self.  Harriet M. Welch (the M. was her own invention) is the daughter of rather well-to-do socialites.  Raised by her nurse Ole Golly until the ripe old age of eleven, Harriet must come to terms with Ole Golly's eventual abandonment.  Ole Golly marries and leaves Harriet to her own devices just as the aforementioned tragedy involving her friends and the notebook occurs.  The combination of the nurse's disappearance from Harriet's life (leaving behind such oh-so helpful pieces of advice as, \\"Don't cry\\", and the like) and the subsequent hatred directed at Harriet by her former friends makes Harriet into a veritable she-devil.  A willful child from the start (punishments are few and far between in the Welch family) Harriet slowly spirals downward until a helpful note from Ole Golly gives her the advice she needs to carry on.<br />So many things about this book appeal to kids.  The realistic nature of peer interactions is one.  Harriet randomly despises various kids, even before her notebook is read.  After making their lives terrible, she eventually has to experience what they themselves have had to deal with.  Author Louise Fitzhugh is such a good writer, though, that even as you disapprove of Harriet's more nasty tendencies you sympathize with her.  Honestly, who would want ink dumped down their back?  As Harriet observes various people on her spy route, she writes her observations about them as well as about life itself.  She hasn't quite figured out the differences between her life and the life of her best friend Sport (the son of an impoverished irresponsible writer) though she does briefly ponder if she herself is rich (the fact that she has her own private bath, nurse, and family cook never quite occurs to her).  On the whole, the book contains a multitude of wonderful characters.  Harriet's parents are both amusing and annoying, completely dedicated to their daughter and completely clueless about her needs.  I was especially shocked by a section of the book in which Harriet asks her mother if she'll be allowed to eat dinner with her parents that night. Gaah!<br />Accompanying the text are Fitzhugh's own meticulous line drawings.  They're fantastic and eerie.  Combined with this timeless story (timeless in all the good ways) the book deserves its status as one of the best books for children.  Read it again to remember.  You'll find a whole lot more than you bargained for.heir back?  As Harriet observes various people on her spy route, she writes her observations about them as well as about life itself.

It is an early reader story that looks death straight in the eye without blinking or making up wild stories.  It is honest and pure and the best kind of book for adults or children and I love it very much.<br />The plot begins with the best possible opening sentence:<br />\\"Where's Papa going with that ax?\\", said Fern to her mother as they were setting the table for breakfast.<br />Papa is, of course, going out to kill Wilbur the runt piglet.  Saving him from this fate, Fern takes a personal interest in the pig, raising him by hand until he is bought by her uncle.  On the farm, Wilbur makes the acquaintance of Charlotte A. Cavatica, a beautiful kind spider.  The two grow to become good friends, and it is through Charlotte's cunning that she finds a way to ultimately save Wilbur from becoming bacon for breakfast  The book not only gives sympathy to pigs as adorable little creatures (as back-flipping Wilbur, helped by Garth Williams's illustrations, most certainly is) but also to spiders as well.  Charlotte is beautifully written.  A perfect lady with an amazing vocabulary, she is the height of poise and good manners.  The grand dame of the barnyard.  E.B. White brilliantly captures emotions that all children can identify with.  Loneliness, fear, friendship, and love.  The story is simple, but undoubtedly White's best.<br />Disney approached White about animating \\"Charlotte's Web\\", an offer White adamantly refused.  Years later the film was animated instead by a studio that was not Disney, making a truly terrible movie out of a pretty spectacular book.  This is for the best, though.  Had Disney succeeded in getting the rights, we would probably be remembering the movie and not the book (much as when we think of Mary Poppins we forget it was once a story).  Hence, \\"Charlotte's Web\\" remains a masterpiece.  A quiet lovable masterpiece.	2004-03-22

Using a beautiful amalgam of line, space, and form, this 1952 Caldecott winner is truly worth of the award it won so long ago.  In this simple story, two dogs (Nap and Winkle) dig up a bone together in the yard.  The two find themselves unable to determine who the bone belongs to, however, due to the fact that Nap saw it first and Winkle touched it first.  The dogs then proceed to ask a variety of different people (a farmer, a goat, an apprentice barber) who the bone belongs to.  The people they ask, however, each have their own agendas and leave the dogs no wiser than before.  It's only after the two ask a fellow dog that they come to a single conclusion about the bone's rightful owner.<br />Ostensibly, this is a book about sharing.  But I like to think the plot is a little more complex than that.  Sure, sharing comes into it, but the story really seems to show how people are only interested sometimes in satisfying their own needs, rather than the needs of others.  Even the big dog at the end is more partial to the bone for his own purposes than the purposes of Nap and Winkle.  So what we have here is a deceptively simple plot wrapped in an easy to understand package.  The plot alone is enough to keep it memorable for years to come, but then you get to the illustrations.  Ladies and gentlemen, I need only direct you to the first title page spread show how adept and spectacular this book truly is.  This picture displays all the characters in the book interacting in interesting ways.  All well and good, but the impressive nature of the picture comes through when you realize they've all been drawn against a black background.  Suddenly the illustrator is using negative space in creative new ways (as well as placing the colors you'll find in the book as outlines).  This is really a remarkable story.  Only the colors red, black, white, and yellow appear in the illustrations but their adept combinations make the book both a fascinating look at 1950s design as well as the perfect compliment to a great story.  On the whole, I give this book two thumbs way way up.  I can't promise you that the book hasn't grown a little dated over the years, but the kids who loved it back in the day will be equal in numbers to the kids who love it today.perfect compliment to a great story.

Some books speak directly to this need, focusing on sibling relations.  Others, like \\"Ginger\\", tell a story from an entirely different point of view.  A distinctly feline one at that.<br />Ginger is a pampered happy orange tabby.  When his normal routines are upset by a new grey kitten, Ginger is incensed.  In a fit of pique Ginger leaves home.  It is only when the little girl who owns the cats gives each animal his own space (separate food dishes, separate sleeping spaces, etc.) that Ginger and the little grey truly start to get along.  The book speaks as much to parents as it does to children.  In short, you cannot just throw two people (or animals) together without giving each their own space at first.  If the story is charming (and it is, it is), then the illustrations match it perfectly.  Voake has a wonderful grasp of cat positions and attitudes.  When Ginger is curled up in his cat hamper with one paw placed gently across his eyes, he is both adorable and entirely cat-like.  Likewise the kitten's playful attack on Ginger's tail is perfectly drawn.  If you're searching for either a good introduction-to-a-new-sibling book or just a cute kitty story, \\"Ginger\\" is sure to please either way.	2004-03-22

Here, author and illustrator Base has combined the gimmick book (a water hole is cut out of each page, growing smaller as each animal drinks from it), with the counting book (each page displays a larger number of animals), with the informative travelogue (each page appears somewhere new in the world with animals from that region), with the hidden surprise book (you can see tons of different animals hidden in each scene).  It's as if Base sat down one day to draw the impossible and did so with a mere flick of the pen.  The book is amazing.<br />If you're unfamiliar with Graeme Base, allow me to sum him up.  Here we have an illustrator able to draw animals that are undoubtedly not photo-realistic, but remarkably real looking.  These creatures are both cartoony and lifelike.  Colors imbue every scene to the point of wonder.  Base also is adept at the tiny details that make up much of his work.  Because a lot of the fun from this story comes from finding animals hidden within the trees, weeds, bamboo, etc. that surround the water hole, Base must be especially cunning to make them both obvious and yet a part of the landscape.  And I haven't even mentioned the pictures that run along the frame of each water hole scene.  For each two-page spread, the artist has provided black silhouettes around the border that display the animals you can find hidden in the pictures, as well as their names.  Don't know what a gharial or a tapir is?  You will.<br />At the end of the book, Base provides each number and the part of the world it belongs to.  These range from India and Africa to Europe and the Galapagos Islands.  The book is, quite frankly, exhausting.  I've summed it up, but there is always more to tell.  I haven't mentioned the tree frogs that dot every scene or the sub-committee of ladybugs.  You will simply have to read it yourself.  The book deserves to be remembered as one of the most beautiful (and clever) counting books ever devised.  My advice is to snap it up, post haste.oned the tree frogs that dot every scene or the sub-committee of ladybugs.  You will simply have to read it yourself.

In the long and varied history of Ms. Mother Goose, so many collections and books of nursery rhymes have been made that it's a wonder anyone keeps track anymore. Certainly I was a child when this particular treasury originally came out and until my current grown state I'd never even heard of it. Illustrated by Arnold Lobel (the nice man who introduced the world to \\"Frog and Toad\\") this book is nothing if not extensive. It runs the gamut of rhymes, from classics like \\"Three Blind Mice\\" to limericks to tongue-twisters. It is a breathtaking achievement.<br />Many a nursery rhyme book, if extensive, will place two or three rhymes on a page and choose to illustrate only one. Not so Mr. Lobel. It is with great manual dexterity that he has found ways to merge, combine and bring together like-rhymes so as to combine their illustrations into a single motif. Consider his page containing romantic poems. Under around and through a single arbor dwell characters that act out such poems as \\"Something old, something new\\", \\"I love coffee\\", \\"Roses are red\\", and \\"If you love me, love me true\\". Poems about the weather, food, and royalty are similarly grouped. Longer poems, such as the classic \\"Partridge in a pear tree\\" are given full page multi-spreads. Lobel is nothing if not meticulous in his craft.<br />I did have an occasional objection. Though the book is expertly indexed, there is not so much as an author's note or preface explaining where he got these poems. The title page merely reads, \\"Selected and illustrated by Arnold Lobel\\", with scant attention to exactly WHERE he got them. This isn't idle curiosity either. More than one of these poems contains wordings different from those known to the pubic at large. For example, instead of the poem \\"London Bridge is falling down\\" we read that \\"London Bridge is broken down\\". Or smaller changes, such as making a ha' penny a half penny in \\"Christmas is coming\\".<br />Diligent parents beware. This book abounds with capital punishment and death. Much like the early fairy tales, nursery rhymes weren't always for the kiddie set. Adults liked them just as much. In the edition I happened to borrow from the library, some extraordinarily concerned parents took offense to a couple phrases in \\"This is the house that Jack built\\" (changing \\"That killed the rat\\" to \\"That bumped the rat\\" and \\"That waked the priest all shaved and shorn\\" to \\"That waked the minister all shaved and shorn\\"). Oog.<br />In the end, this is really a fabulous collection. The illustrations are adept (containing some very funny interpretations as well) and the rhymes not only familiar but enjoyable.

Now let's say you're that same parent, but you'd like to instill the wonders of Jack Webb in your little one.  Enter Margie Palatini and Richard Egielski's, \\"The Web Files\\".  More \\"dum de dum dum\\"s than you could shake a fist at.<br />Bill and Web (partners) are working the barnyard shift when they hear trouble ah-brewing.  Someone's been pirating a peck of purple peppers (ready for pickeling).  It's off to confront he usual suspects, when our heroes get a lead.  In the end, you can rest assured that the dastardly villain will have met his just desserts and our brave ducktectives can work another day.<br />There are people who will buy this book, read it over and over, and love every minute of it.  They'll revel in the exceedingly terrible puns that crop up with frightening regularity.  They'll soak up the detective atmosphere (a combination of \\"Dragnet\\" and Ed McBain).  They'll never get bored with this puppy, and that's all right.  There really are some nice things in this book.  Egielski's adept illustrations compliment the rising action, best displayed in a scene in which a variety of fairy tale characters hound the police precinct with tales of woe.  I was especially taken with the third degree our heroes give a distraught Little Boy Blue.<br />As for myself, the aforementioned scenes are gold.  But the puns.... lordy begordy the puns.  Admittedly I have a low pun tolerance.  If you can read the following sentence without twitching, then this is undoubtedly a good book to get:  \\"A lot of squawking going on down in the coop area, Ducktective Web.  Looks like fowl play.  Report says feathers are flying.  Chief says we should check out the chicks.\\"  You get the idea.  I, personally, had problems with that sentence, but that's just me.  Other people will adore this book.  It does have some nice touches here and there and is chock full of enough movies and cop shows to bring a chuckle every other page.  If you like a good rousing yarn and don't mind slightly painful text, this is the perfect book for a dark and rainy night.  Hint:  Have your kids hum the \\"Dragnet\\" closing music when the book's villain is tried and convicted.

Drawing on everything from \\"The eensy, weensy spider\\" to \\"The lion and the unicorn\\", this is an excellent introduction to many a rhyme.  Accompanying the classic texts (and it is important to note that she has used the versions best known) are Cousins's own brightly construed creations.  The effect is both slapdash and carefully thought out.<br />For all that Lucy Cousins is British, this collection of nursery rhymes has a distinctively American tone and flavor to it.  Certainly the poems listed here all originated in Europe.  No question.  But just consider the fate of the poem \\"Ladybird ladybird fly away home\\".  Now we're hearing about a ladybug.  Were these words changed for the U.S. edition of the title?  On the other hand, it's a huge relief to be reading nursery rhymes in their original violent states.  There's nothing worse than a watered down version of Goosey Goosey Gander or the Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe.  Nope.  Now there's whippings and plenty of old men thrown down stairs.  Don't think I advocate whippings and the throwing of geriatrics, but isn't it nice to read the nursery rhymes you remember as a kid yourself?  And you turned out okay, didn't you?  Just a thought.<br />The pictures are broad colorful concoctions.  Lots of bright colors and thick black lines.  I wouldn't go searching for delicate linework in this book.  The drawings are rather childlike in and of themselves, possibly inspiring the youngsters to draw some nursery rhymes of their own.  The pictures are nicely multi-ethnic too.  If you'll note the King's Men in the Humpty Dumpty rhyme, you'll see what I mean (though I do worry about a few of those eyeless soldiers).  On the whole, this is a great book.  Fun and jumpity.  Pretty and bright.  It's not my favorite version of these rhymes (hats off to Arnold Lobel for that honor) but it deserves an honorary spot on every child's shelf.

Starting with \\"Caddie Woodlawn\\" (1935), continuing with \\"Roller Skates\\" (1936), and capitulating with the delightful \\"Thimble Summer\\" (1938) these books all followed spunky independent females with little to no regard for the traditional roles women had always carried.  But while \\"Caddie\\" and \\"Roller Skates\\" were period pieces that ultimately ended with the girls giving in to society's restraints, \\"Thimble Summer\\" trumps this trend.  In it, we have a farm girl named Garnet who has a load of exciting summer adventures and who ends her tale wearing sailor pants doing hand stands over and over again in a pasture.<br />The tale of \\"Thimble Summer\\" begins when Garnet finds a silver thimble in a nearby dried lakebed.  According to Garner, the summer's wonderful aspects only take place after this key event.  Her father receives a loan from the government allowing him to build a new barn.  Her family meets and virtually adopts an adorable homeless boy.  Garnet shows her favorite pig at the state fair and wins a blue ribbon.  All these events are told with a marvelous simplicity and a real sense of being there with Garnet.  From the very first page of this book, you notice the author's excellent writing style.  About the heat of the summer Enright writes, \\"It was like being inside of a drum. The sky like a bright skin was stretched tight above the valley, and the earth too, was tight and hard with heat\\".  You're in safe hands with this writer.  Don't believe me?  Here's another wonderful descriptive passage.  \\"Her shoes hurt her; and with aching feet and her bundle and empty pocketbook she felt like an old, old woman coming home from seeing grandchildren who didn't love her\\".<br />But observe this book within its 1938 context.  Here's a girl that does a boy's chores.  We never see her darn socks or cook, though she's often seen working in the fields.  She's nine or so, so she doesn't go about falling in love (not even with the adorable homeless boy).  She wears pants most of the time, is never badgered by either parent to be more feminine and (the coup de grace) at the end of the story she plans to someday have a farm of her own.  Fabulous.  Then there are those wonderful little details about the past.  Kids reading this book may not get the references to G-men, Zeppelin shaped balloons, or the running boards of cars.  Fortunately these spots of the past are either<br />self-evident or mercilessly scant.<br />Is the book flawless then?  Almost.  There are a couple tiny flaws here and there.  The line drawings accompanying the text (drawn by the author herself) are magnificent.  Unfortunately, there's one time they belie the text.  If you've a child who's overweight in any way, this may not be the best book to show them.  While Garnet's best female friend Citronella is continually called \\"fat\\", in the book's pictures she's the most average kid you've ever seen (compared to the waiflike Garnet, of course).  Any child with body image problems is going to see the pictures, read the text, and come up with some pretty heart-wrenching conclusions.  If Garnet is normal then...  You get the picture.<br />I don't really understand why kids don't know this book better.  Anyone who's ever wanted to live on a farm in the country would enjoy it.  Anyone who's ever wanted to hitchhike like Garnet, spend a night in a library, or swim rivers on their own would like it.  It's a pip, this one.  It's got moxie.  Don't forgo the pleasures of \\"Thimble Summer\\" simply because it's old.

Or rather, the home country hero.  With the massive collection of British fantasy writers out there, sometimes it's nice to reflect that at least we have Lloyd Alexander.  Fantasy author extraordinaire.  As prolific as he is talented, his books have remained in circulation since the 1960s.  Therefore, it was with great surprise that I consulted the copyright date on his delightful \\"Time Cat\\", only to find that my newly published paperback copy was the latest edition of a title that originally came out in 1963.  1963 was a long time ago, yet this book has stayed relatively fresh for a historical fantasy.  There are problems with it, no question.  But on the whole it's an interesting story that holds up in the end.<br />In \\"Time Cat\\" there are two protagonists.  One is Gareth, a cat capable of talking and time traveling when it pleases.  The other is Jason, Gareth's human friend.  At the insistence of Jason, the two set off on a series of cat-based adventures around the globe at different points in the past.  They find themselves entertaining a pharoh, running from the witch-obsessed Germans of the 1600s, prisoners of Incas, and friends with Roman conquerors.  For the kid who likes cats and likes adventures, this book is ideal.  If, on the other hand, the reader doesn't particularly care for felines, they'd do well to choose another book.  This is strictly a cat-lover affair.  Each time period, in its way, relates to a period of history in the cat species.  We see the way the Manx cats got their names, how cats were worshipped in Egypt, and called the devil in the 17th century.  Jason and Gareth also proceed to make the acquaintance of several historical figures, from St. Patrick to Leonardo Da Vinci.  There is even a chance meeting with an Irish lass that acts so much like the lovely Eilonwy from the \\"Prydain Chronicles\\" you find yourself wondering how she hopped out of those books and into this one.  The reading level of this book is less difficult than Alexander's \\"Prydain Chronicles\\", and makes for a good early fantasy tale.<br />Of course there are problems with the book.  Since Alexander is asking us to believe that Jason and Gareth are attending events that happened in the world's past, there's an understanding that what we read is based on fact.  So when we read interpretations of the past that are clearly untrue, it's cause for concern.  For example, the section on Leonardo Da Vinci needs some work.  It is true that Da Vinci did some wonderful character studies of cats.  However, as the illegitimate son of a gentleman, Da Vinci was unable to enter into a respectable profession and was, in a sense, forced to rely on his artistic talents.  In this book, however, there is no mention of illegitimacy, Da Vinci's father treats him as his natural son, and attempts to get his boy to become a notary.  Blatant historical untruths are not overly common in this book, but they do pop up every once in a while, causing the reader a bit of discomfort.<br />And then there are the problems with the time traveling itself.  In an effort to get the story rolling higgledy piggledy, Alexander has eschewed any real explanation of how Gareth's time traveling works.  This is all well and good, except that it makes one wonder why Gareth and his boy do not simply vanish to another time when they are held captive again and again and again.  Constantly coming into danger, one wonders why Gareth chooses only calm moments to travel.  Are there rules here we know nothing about?  One would beg a little more information.  Otherwise you don't feel particularly concerned when our intrepid heroes are in mortal peril.  After all, they could just leave.<br />Finally, there are the natives.  Jason and Gareth consistently find themselves joining up with invaders of one sort or another.  Sometimes they're preparing to invade Briton.  Other times, they help their friend the \\"nice\\" conquistador.  For a 1963 book, Alexander is fairly good about portraying different races.  He is sometimes prone to statements like, \\"These Britons are like big children\\" (enough to make a Celt's blood boil), but on the whole he does fairly well.  I did have a small difficulty with the sympathetic conquistador bit.  From reading this book you'd think the Incas and the Spanish lived happily and peacefully together for years to come after Jason and Gareth's visit.  And this is not the case.<br />For the child that knows his or her history and has a bit of a kitty obsession, this is an ideal story.  There's fighting, adventure, friends, foes, and an interesting plot.  It is not a perfect book, but it's worth looking into, no question.  To sum up; A swell romp.about portraying different races.

Not I said the .... you know.  This is the classic song in which, \\"the solution proves worse than the predicament\\".  In other words, the cure is worse than the disease.  Here we have the supposed old lady (though I have my doubts considering her strong physique and lovely red hair) who has swallowed a fly.  And whatta fly it is!  This isn't your usual tiny crawling insect.  On every other page we view a whopping magnificently HUGE fly, roughly the size of the old lady's head.  Most of the creatures the old lady swallows to catch the previous animal are similarly horrific in some way.  If your kids weren't afraid of spiders before this book, they will be now.  And whatta hairy red-eyed sharp toothed bony kneed spider it is!  This is followed next by the scariest chicken you ever did see (again red-eyed) and then a pupil-less (but nonetheless red-eyed) cat that stares off into space.  You get the idea.  The text is a little different from the versions of the song I remember from my own innocent youth.  Instead of vaguely supposing, \\"perhaps she'll die\\" at the end of every line, this book comes to the absolute conclusion that \\"I guess she'll die\\".  Seems logical.  And sure enough the last page displays a blank tombstone with a single blue bottle containing three woebegotten red flowers sitting on the grass.  Read this book well (or sing it) and the kids'll come screaming for more.  But boy is that one creepy fly!  If nothing else, this book will teach the kiddies the dangers of fly knoshing.

If you've stumbled onto the Lemony Snicket series by chance, I wouldn't necessarily command you to read the first book before this, the second.  But you'd probably wish to do so yourself.  Following the further adventures of the unfortunate Baudelaire orphans, we find our intrepid trio finally living with a relative they've grown to love.  Uncle Monty (as he prefers to be called) is a herpetologist of the finest pedigree, and he offers the siblings the first real home they've had in a while.  Unfortunately, misery continues to dog them in the form of the evil Count Olaf.  Donning one of his many disguises, Olaf does his darndest, yet again, to get his oily hands on the Baudelaire fortune.  And so forth.<br />One of the finest books in the series, no question.  And, perhaps, one of the saddest.  After all, Uncle Monty is one of the few guardians with whom the orphans feel a real kinship.  Snicket does a lovely job displaying their affection for him which simultaneously not making you too too terribly unhappy when that joyful confluence must break apart.  Happiness is not in store for the Baudelairs for some time now.  We shouldn't be wishing it too soon.  Still, Uncle Monty's exit is a real blow to the series in that you really do come to like him before his removal from the book.  Just the same, there's plenty to love.  I, myself, was quite taken with the movie, \\"Zombies In the Snow\\", that the Baudelaires watch with heavy hearts at one point in the proceedings.  Hollywood should take note - \\"Zombies In the Snow\\" may be the next big storyline to hit!<br />For happy book involving ponies, locate one of the bazillion pony books out there.  For misery, delightful redundancy, and a truly gross villain I direct your attention to Snicket's latest.  Tis a wonderful read for the whole gosh-darn family (though he'd be loathe to say so himself).	2004-03-13

In today's high tech, fast-paced, Internet age it's a calming thing to stop a think a little bit about Easter eggs, and the trees on which they hang.  \\"The Egg Tree\\" won its Caldecott medal in 1951 and became the selection of choice of the Institute of Graphic Arts.  Here, author Katherine Milhous has taken the lively colors and sweeping designs of the Pennsylvania Dutch and applied them to a tale of Easter discoveries and mild fame.<br />Siblings Katy and Carl are spending their Easter seasons with their Grandmom and cousins.  This being their first Easter with such relatives, they are woefully unprepared for the annual Easter Egg hunt.  Katy is disappointed when she cannot find any eggs, but discovers a cache of beautifully hand-painted eggs tucked away in the attic.  This leads to Grandmom teaching all the kiddies how to paint their own eggs, culminating in an egg tree that displays their work (and garners widespread fame as well).<br />Children unfamiliar with the Pennsylvania Dutch lifestyle will undoubtedly wonder why the characters in this tale look Amish.  Some simple explanations (always assuming the parents themselves understand the distinction) may be in order.  After that, expect to be fielding requests for egg painting as well.  Helpful instructions detailing how one goes about egg painting are included on the back of the book jacket.  Certainly the book and the instruction make egg blowing seem to be the simplest thing in the world.  Just don't be surprised if you have a mighty difficult time blowing egg yolks out of tiny tiny holes.<br />On the whole, the book is strong.  The colors are a little more muted than those of books today.  And apart from Katy's initial fears that she would not find a single egg, there's not much in the way of dramatic tension.  But that's all right.  This book's a class act through and through.  It may seem a bit dated, it's true.

I don't demand much from my young adult novels.  Some interesting characters, a worthwhile plot, and a little depth and I'm content.  In \\"Hope Was Here\\", you have two out of three.  Unfortunately, the two include the characters and the plot.  As for depth, you're better off searching a Pokemon cartoon for more subtle variations of human emotion and capabilities than you have here.  Though a book that undoubtedly serves a need, \\"Hope Was Here\\" is one of the most shallow two-dimensional written works to be created in the last ten years.  The good are good, the bad are bad, and all the children are above average.<br />In \\"Hope Was Here\\", young Hope (who renamed herself after twelve years of carrying the moniker \\"Tulip\\" against her will) and her aunt are moving from Brooklyn to Wisconsin.  Their restaurant was plundered by a wily colleague and the two, who've been together through it all, are hoping this next job won't suck.  No fears there.  Moving to Mulhoney, Wisconsin they find a range of friends and foes.  The town is currently coming on to election time, and the proprietor of the Welcome Stairways Diner, G.T., is running against the currently crooked mayor.  As the book flap says, \\"What follows - as Hope meets politics, corruption, and her past head-on - is at the heart of this memorable, laugh-out-loud story about honor, trust, and serving up your very best\\".  Sounds good.  Doesn't deliver.<br />Here's the problem.  From the minute Hope meets a character in this book you know instantly if they are good or bad.  From the black waitress Flo (her actual name, I swear), the immigrant busboy Yuri, and the short-tempered (with a heart of gold) waitress Mary Lou, to G.T., the saint with cancer who's running for mayor.  G.T., by the way, hasn't a flaw in his body save the leukemia.  You kinda wish G.T. would throw a brick through a window or show SOME sign that he has dark thoughts.  Those rare scenes in which he and Hope's Aunt Addie supposedly spar are so washed out and light that you're left feeling a little cheated.  Take, for example, a fight between them that Hope calls their \\"worst face-off\\".  Says Addie...<br /> \\"I'm hard on myself because that's the only way food is elevated\\".<br /> \\"Maybe you'd have more fun if you backed off a bit\\".<br />Her response to this biting heart-wrenching insult?  \\"G.T., there's too much onion in this dish and I'm not going to serve it until I've got it right\\".  Take that G.T.<br />To allow any good guy in this book a moment of real unrighteous anger or a spew of biting insults would be to give them too much humanity.  You could no more see G.T. grumble at someone on a particularly painful day (he's allowed considering he has CANCER, people) than you could find one of the corrupt politicians in this story reading a bedtime tale to their little one.  Bad guys are corrupt all the way through.  Good guys get a little sad sometimes, then shake it off.  Hope herself is flawless, only growing angry at people who truly deserve it and THEN never taking her frustrations out on anyone who cares for her.  A real teenager would probably fight with her aunt or her mom at least once during their acquaintance.  Not our Hope.  No teen in this book ever does anything less than saintly, save two working poor villains brought in to terrify our heroine for one brief convenient plot point.  On top of that, G.T. spouts more platitudes during the course of this story than any philosopher ever could.  I did hope, in some part of my heart, that this book wouldn't have the happy-happy-happy-plus-one-tragic-death, ending once so common in bad teen lit.  Not to ruin it for you, but that is exactly what Bauer serves up.  We aren't even allowed an ENDING with moral complexity.  *sigh*<br />There are people in this world that need books that talk about good and evil and hope in straightforward ways.  This book is for them.  Consider it comfort food.  Then there are people who like books in which their characters, for all their good, still harbor dark places in their hearts.  This book is not for them.  That book would be, \\"True Confessions of a Heartless Girl\\", a kind of Canadian version of this story without the meaningful life lessons every other line.  If a well-written book is on your menu, head thataway.  But if you'd like a story that doesn't challenge you, doesn't contain any good guys with emotional damage, and has a faux happy ending, welcome to \\"Hope Was Here\\"., for all their good, still harbor dark places in their hearts.

If you haven't read a book that combines the individual talents of Lester and Pinkney (Julius Lester writes, Jerry Pinkney draws) then this might be a good place to start.  The two artists have reinterpreted a variety of classic African-American tales to their own liking.  From their, \\"The Tales of Uncle Remus: The Adventures of Brer Rabbit\\" to the more recent \\"Sam and the Tigers\\" (a reworked \\"Little Black Sambo\\") they are nothing if not prolific.  With this book they tackle one of this country's tallest tales.  The legend of John Henry.  And whether you delight in their version or cling to the story you learned as a child (as I confess, I did while reading it) you have to step back and admire their enthusiasm.<br />In this version of \\"John Henry\\" the duo has consulted a variety of texts and versions, adding some special touches and flourishes of their own.  This John Henry is a baby one day and an adult the next.  He can outrace the meanest man in town and carve through solid rock with a rainbow draped across his shoulders.  When the final showdown against a steam drill comes,  John Henry's ready.  He beats that drill only to die from a burst heart.  We are assured, however, that he is buried on the White House Lawn and that at night you can hear his voice singing.<br />There's some getting used to here, certainly.  No refrain of, \\"I'm gonna die with a hammer in my hand\\" is chanted.  And John Henry doesn't work the railroads with everyone else.  Rather, he accidentally stumbles across the man with the steam engine while on travels of his own.  And then Lester has tried to make the story applicable to the youth of today.  He did this in \\"The Tales of Uncle Remus\\" too, and I had some very similar problems.  In this particular book, for example, it mentions early on that, \\"That day John Henry helped his papa rebuild the porch he had busted through, added a wing onto the house with an indoor swimming pool and one of the jacutzis\\".  Personally, I don't see why this helps the text at all.  I dunno.  Maybe kids like hearing about Jacuzzis in their picture books.  But for me, at any rate, it distracts.  Pinkney's illustrations, on the other hand, are above criticism.  Here we have a Ferret-Faced Freddy that has a mean weasel-like face.  We see John Henry grow older and older as we watch, as well as taller and taller.  I liked the clothes, the setting, and the landscapes.  I especially liked the fact that John's gap-toothed grin is with him from infancy through adulthood.<br /><br />The world is sorely in need of more African-American fables as remarkable as this one.  And it goes without saying that everyone EVERYONE should know the ballad of John Henry by heart.  I'm not willing to drop the towel and declare this particular version the epitome of all John Henrys, but it is still a noble work.  Feel free to criticize it, but don't discount it.

Looking at Karen Baicker's enjoyable, \\"And I Can Do It Too!\\", I'm struck by how she has taken such a simple subject and applied it to a variety of situations.  More impressive by far, however, are Ken Wilson-Max's brave and deceptively simple illustrations to the story.  If you're looking for something to read to those antsy early readers that let's them play along and join in on the chorus, this book's for you.<br />The book jacket to this story puts it best when it says that this is truly a tale about, \\"growing up surrounded by love\\".  The little protagonist in this story is doing her darndest to do everything the grown-ups around her do.  Her dad pours orange juice? \\"I can do it too!\\"  Her grandpa reads to her?  \\"I can do it too!\\"  You get the idea.  The thick paints employed by skillful Wilson-Max are bright and colorful.  They expertly convey everything from a fancy tea to a tender moment of hugs.  Additionally, the sturdy pages in this book hold up well to little hands.  As for the pictures, there are no tiny details here, making this book a perfect one for group storytimes.  You can make out every person and action in this tale from quite a distance.  And those brushstrokes.  Those wonderful wonderful brushstrokes.  You can tell Wilson-Max had a lot of fun painting these pictures.  It's a lovely story told with eloquence and style.  A perfect story for any little one that's just getting the gist of everyday chores and actions.	2004-03-13

As I read Peter Sis's spectacular \\"Komodo\\", I was finding myself switching into worry mode as I went through the text.  The story, if you are unfamiliar with it, follows the obsession of a boy who loves dragons more than anything else in the world.  Being the doting parents they are, the boy and his mom and dad take a plane trip to Indonesia to see some komodo dragons for themselves.  While waiting for a dragon to appear for some tourists, the boy separates himself from the party and finds himself face to face with his own komodo dragon.<br />Now as I read this I found myself mentally berating Peter Sis.  Saying things along the lines of, \\"Why isn't he telling kids how dangerous komodo dragons are?  That a single bite could kill you with its bacteria?  That they're not the cuddly lizards so imagined in this book?\\"  At which point I suddenly realized how stupid I sounded.  Let's face the facts.  As Mr. Sis himself recounts, the komodo dragon is native to one, count `em, one country in the world.  Children reading this book are not going to run into the street, find a komodo dragon, and try to make it a pet.  So let's just settle back and admire Sis's illustrations and text for what they are.  Thoughtful and meticulous.<br />If you've never viewed a Peter Sis illustration closely, I highly recommend it.  It's a trip.  Using the tiniest black pen strokes imaginable, Sis conjures up miles and miles of details in each thoughtful illustration.  The very first double-page spread is of the narrator's class picture.  He notes that it's very easy to locate him because of his dragon t-shirt.  Anyone unfamiliar with this picture, however, will be stunned by the vast sea of children presented, our narrator wearing his trademark jaunty red cap and white dragon shirt.  And what child wouldn't want to live in a house that's wallpapered in dragons?  Or a bedroom chock full of everything from a dragon punching bag to a real skull.  This kid's got it made.  The book's colors shift slowly from the warm reddish tones of the boy's bedroom to the mysterious deep green foliage of Komodo Island.  Keep an eye out for all the komodos hidden in the leaves, trees, grass, etc. too!  A helpful fact section located at the back of the book is the perfect compliment to this gripping subject.<br />Kids need obsessions.  They need animals that are cool but not done to death like dinosaurs or elephants.  The komodo dragon offers the perfect combination of deadly abilities and cool looks.  Now we have a book to encompass all the wonders and looks of this incredible animal.  This book is truly a finely honed piece of work.nching bag to a real skull.  This kid's got it made.

Like a moral of a story has been staring you in the face and you're just too slow or dim-witted to get it?  Such was my reaction after reading Leo Lionni's elusive, \\"Little Blue and Little Yellow\\".  I liked it.  Of course I did.  But on my honor as a gentleman I just did NOT get the book's message.  Which is perhaps exactly as it should be.<br />We all are familiar with Leo Lionni's work, even if we don't initially think we are.  Whether you've seen his cut out mice or forest scenes, his is a recognizable style.  In this particular book Lionni has relied on roughly hewn pieces of brightly colored paper (or is it fabric?) to tell a story.  The tale follows two blobs of color.  On is Blue.  The other is Yellow.  Yellow and Blue are good friends and lead productive blobby lives with their other little friends.  They play games, attend school, etc.  One day Blue looses Yellow for a little while and when they are reunited they hug until they meld into a single splotch of green.  The single green splotch, however, looks nothing like Blue or Yellow.  Whatever will our intrepid heroes do?<br />Suffice to say, all turns out well in the end.  The status quo is maintained, peace reigns, yadda yadda yadda.  So what's the moral of the story?  Just to help you figure it out, the last two pages of the text display Blue and Yellows momma and poppas hugging one another until THEY turn green.  Maybe it doesn't mean anything at all.  But it certainly does make for an interesting tale.  Nothing like simplicity to tie up the ole synapses for a while.<br />I can see children enjoying this book.  I can also see different children growing bored with this book.  It really is going to depend on the child more than anything else.  If you have a kid that likes rousing adventures about (oh I dunno) tangible objects, this may not be the book for them.  If, however, you've a child who's a little more dreamy.  A little more open to different kinds of stories and characters, consider this book a perfect fit.  Colorful, interesting, and unique.  Lionni does many things with this book, but he does not disappoint.f stories and characters, consider this book a perfect fit.  Colorful, interesting, and unique.

Based on the real life adventures of Molly Bannaky, the book traces Molly's life from English servant to American indentured servant to a free woman with a land of her own.  Molly's tale is remarkable not only because it is based on fact, but because hers is a story of interracial adoration.  Molly buys an African slave named Bannaky to help her on her farm, later freeing him and marrying him as well.  In time, Molly's own eldest daughter would do the same, finally having the child Benjamin Banneker; the grandson of Molly.<br />Though Benjamin Banneker certainly deserves a fabulous picture book of his own, I found it fitting that this story focused more squarely on Molly herself.  The text is respectful without fawning.  It explains difficult aspects of the story without bogging down the action.  Accompanying Alice McGill's words are Chris K. Soentpiet's amazing illustrations.  From the cover of this book Molly regards the viewer with a cool clear eye, neither appraising nor disapproving.  No one in this book comes off as gorgeous or a standardized beauty.  At the same time, Soenpiet's characters are individuals.  Bannaky, Molly's husband, is especially interesting to watch from scene to scene.  If I had any objections to this book at all, it might concern the choice of ending.  It's rather abrupt, never explaining the significance of Benjamin Banneker, though an interesting Historical Note is tacked on at the end.  It would have been nice for the plot itself to have wrapped up neatly without relying on the factual record to sum up for it.<br />Molly Bannaky did what few other women could.  From owning her own farm to deciding who she loved and why, Molly is an above par woman of the 1700s.  We don't know much about the individual women of this time period.  Quite frankly, you're rarely going to find a woman in a play or film based on that era who isn't accusing or being accused of witchcraft.  What a relief it is then to see a tale about a woman who lived her life according to her own rules, despite what the moralists about her might have said.  She was a role model then.  She is a role model now.e a tale about a woman who lived her life according to her own rules, despite what the moralists about her might have said.  She was a role model then.

I was read \\"The Twelve Dancing Princesses\\", illustrated by Errol Le Cain, repeatedly as a child and it has stuck with me ever since.  Some books just do.  For the entirety of my childhood life I loved \\"The Twelve Dancing Princesses\\" more than any other fairy tale, and it was all due to this beautifully mesmerizing book.<br />The classic story of how a king attempts to discover the reason why his daughters wear out their shoes every night is rendered here in sumptuous detail.  Artist Le Cain spent much of his life in Singapore and India, and his early experiences are well represented in his work.  From the gloomy caverns through which the princesses must walk, to the glittering gold, silver, and diamond forests located below the castle, I am still truly mesmerized reading this story.  Every page opposite the text contains a border of delicate imaginings and illustrations.  Heck, I've noticed things in it now that I never even THOUGHT to discover as a child.  Who knew that the good fairy spied on the final wedding?  Not I.<br />It's, to my mind, the most beautifully illustrated fairy tale ever made.  If you doubt me, I only ask that you look at the last picture in the book.  A parting shot of the abandoned princes, waiting for the princesses to return to their underground realm.  Each looking depressed and unhappy as the fake stars and moon hang glittering in the underground sky.  Beauty incarnate.	2004-03-07

How to write a story about a man that was simultaneously brilliant and woebegotten?  Who spoke out for racial equality, strength among the masses, and freedom while also leaving every family who ever loved him?  Partridge has done as good a job as could be done, considering her circumstances.  The result is a meticulously researched labor of love that is just as much tribute as it is tell-all.  As Pete Seeger himself has said about the work, \\"The best book about Woody ever written\\".<br />Woody Guthrie was born in 1912 in Okemah, Oklahoma to a mother with Huntington's Disease and a father who joined lynch mobs and Klu Klux Klans.  Talking about this point in Woody's life, Partridge simultaneously displays all the harsh horrible things Woody had to deal with growing up without actually condemning anyone.  In fact, the portions of the text that talk about Charley Guthrie (Woody's father) joining in the persecution of African-Americans aren't related with any commentary at all.  It's as if Partridge is working on the assumption that the readers will be able to process these facts and come to their own conclusions, rather than have interpretations rammed down their throat.  It is also the first moment the author gives the audience the benefit of the doubt.  It is not the last.<br />Moving on through Woody's life, we see him grow up, loose his parents (one way or another), and join various bands.  We also see him beginning to travel all across the country on his own.  At last, Woody marries and it becomes clear that he is not exactly prime husband material.  Abandoning his wife regularly to travel (sometimes when she's just about to give birth), Woody joins various causes around the country.  When Woody and his wife finally break up, her narrative abruptly ends.  Patridge has a habit of following the people in Woody's life meticulously right up until the moment Woody breaks off all contact with them.  Then, their story ends immediately.  We never really learn how Woody's father ended his life.  Or what became of Woody's children by his first wife (though an afterword in the back of the text explaining Huntington's Disease explains that all but three of his children died either of the disease or of car accidents).  Do we criticize Partridge for her choice or narratives?  Or do we accept that she really couldn't continually follow Woody's friends and relatives because of space and narrative issues?  I'm inclined towards the latter, though it would have been nice to see a little afterword that explains what became of everyone.<br />Moving towards Woody's second wife, the war, and his battle with Huntington's, Partridge nicely melds text with social commentary.  Woody's acceptance of all people, regardless of color, is especially well done.  As he sinks further into Huntington's, and has an affair with a pretty young folk singer, the reader sees how Woody finally loses control.  A little more information about the talented Arlo Guthrie (his son) would not be out of place at this point, but this is Woody's story, I suppose.  Finally, we read Woody's death.  The story ends.<br />Partridge is to be commended for how interesting this book is.  As I read it, my husband continually asked me why this was considered a juvenile book.  Apart from being published by a press for young readers, I have to assume it's considered a youth text because its so doggone interesting.  The words are a little larger than you'd find in an adult biography.  The pictures a little more interesting and consistent.  On the whole it's a great read.  Most wonderful of all is how well the book has been researched.  Partridge includes an Afterword about her own personal connection to the subject, a tribute to the Woody Guthrie Foundation, information on Huntington's Disease, Acknowledgements (in which she mentions her interviews with Arlo Guthrie and Pete Seegar), Source Notes, a Bibliography, an Index, Picture Credits, and Permissions.  She is nothing if not extensive.<br />\\"This Land Was Made For You and Me\\" is not the world's most definitive biography written with youth in mind, but it comes pretty darn close.  But don't limit it to the kids.  Read it yourself.  Learn a little more about what made the great man tick.  Though it's over-quoted, here's what Woody himself had to say about his music:<br />\\"I hate a song that makes you think that you're not any good.

People lacking an understanding of the intelligence of children do not like these books.  And people lacking the comprehension that sometimes a story is good simply because it turns classical conventions on their head do not understand these books.  \\"The Series of Unfortunate Events\\", ever popular and entirely urbane, began here in 1999 with the simple story.  \\"The Bad Beginning\\".  They have been making cool millions ever since.<br />Elegantly bound and rendered beautiful by artist Brett Helquist's adept illustrations, the books tap into that sense of macabre that lurks at the heart of every girl and boy.  Picking up the book, the reader is instantly told not to read the thing.  Says its back, \\"It is my sad duty to write down these unpleasant tales, but there is nothing stopping you from putting this book down at once and reading something happy, if you prefer that sort of thing\\".  It's the old reverse psychology ruse.  Tell the children not to read the story and they'll come screaming at you for more.  The story itself is simple.  The three newly orphaned Baudelaire siblings have been sent to their nearest relative to live; one nasty Count Olaf.  Prepared to do whatever it takes to get his hands on the Baudelaire fortune (a fortune the children themselves cannot inherit until the eldest, Violet, is of age) the Count makes the children's lives miserable, even as he schemes to get their moolah.  Don't think, however, that the children are entirely helpless.  Using their cunning and special skills the kids are more than adequate adversaries to Count Olaf and it is due to their brains that they are able to fight another day.<br />The book uses a lot of classic motifs to appeal to its young readership.  Often the narrator will address the reader directly, either imploring them to go do something cheerier or defining unfamiliar terms for them.  Author Daniel Handler (pen name Lemony Snicket) is an adept writer.  Though the Count is threatening and dislikable, his violence is mostly implied rather than overt (with some definite exceptions).  Kids are safe reading this series and, though they do encounter corpses once in a while, nothing too terrible ever befalls the children.<br />The mystery behind the series has yet to be revealed.  Certainly there are many loose ends to be tied up by the end of these books (there will be, the ever apt, 13 in all).  How did the children's parents die?

Children like stories where characters have mistaken ideas of what the moon is.  The Caldecott winning book, \\"Many Moons\\" (which I HIGHLY recommend you run out and read immediately if not sooner) supposes that the moon is no larger than a thumbnail and made of pure gold.  In this book, \\"Happy Birthday, Moon\\", a small cuddly bear supposes that the moon is like any other creature and, if you get close enough, you can have a conversation with it.  Through a series of misadventures (echoes, trees, and winds) Bear comes to the conclusion that the moon would like a beautiful hat for its birthday.  In the end, he and the moon have (in his mind) grown closer over the course of the story.<br />And boy oh boy is this picture book simple.  No extraneous details or folderols here.  The lines are clear cut and smooth.  From the perfectly circular and yellow moon in the sky to the deftly lined Bear, not a single line or color is out of place here.  For those parents wishing to calm their little ones down with a simply told, simply drawn story, this book is ideal.  Concepts are not difficult to grasp and words never get any more difficult than \\"birthday\\" or \\"beautiful\\".  It is a nice little book.	2004-03-07

In the case of \\"Saffy's Angel\\", author Hilary McKay has combined two or three different fantasies a child might enjoy.  The fantasy of belonging to a big crazy artistic family.  The fantasy of living in a big crazy house full of mysterious boxes and items.  And the fantasy of solving a mystery of one's very own.<br />In this story, young Saffron (Saffy) finds that she is not her parent's child after all. In fact, she was the daughter of her mother's sister, adopted at a very early age.  When Saffy's grandfather dies and leaves her, \\"Saffy's angel\\", the girl sets off on a quest to recover that which is rightfully hers.<br /> The book isn't too dissimilar from \\"From the Mixed Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler\\" in that the story revolves around a mystery (solved by children) and a statue.  The story itself is bright and lively and never gets bogged down by characters, plots, or settings.  McKay too has created imaginative people, each with a distinct and subtle personality.  Many parts of this book are quite amusing (for instance, Saffy's mother leaves a note that tells the others that she'll be hanging the paintings done by the juvenile delinquents she works with that reads, \\"hanging Young Offenders in the library\\").  And the story is a good one.  Top notch, in fact.<br />My qualms (and I did have one or two) involve that old bugaboo \\"the artistic vs. the sane\\".  How often do we read stories in which nice sensible people are considered troglodytes because they act normally and with reason, rather than scatterbrained and \\"artistic\\"?  In this case, the reader is well set up to dislike Saffy's adoptive father.  Bill mostly does not live with the family, preferring to live in London with his art and visit occasionally.  Everyone is perfectly happy with this arrangement, and Bill is often set up as the jerk with too much common sense.  Whenever somebody dies he inevitably acts the pompous unfeeling cad.  On the other hand, the book really doesn't give enough credit to the fact that though an unwelcome parent, he's obviously far more capable than his too often negligent wife.  When the children become ill, he is the one to separate them so that others do not become sick.  He is capable of saying no to the children when they do something stupid or potentially dangerous.  His wife, on the other hand, is completely unfit to be in charge of children.  She spends all her time out of eyeshot or earshot of her kids in a shed where she paints.  She never says no.  When the children (miraculously, only one is a complete brat) act in inappropriate ways, \\"Eve (their mother) always stuck out these grim times as bravely as she could.  After all, she would tell herself, she had known from the day the children were born that they were in every way more talented, intelligent, and wise than she would ever be\\".  Which is her excuse for letting them drive to Wales with her terrible driver daughter at the wheel, sit on window ledges paralyzed with fright, or eat paint found in garbage cans.<br />I loved this book.  I disliked the mother.  Beyond that flaw, it's an enjoyable romp with children that (with the exception of the youngest little spoiled creature) you grow to love slowly but surely.  I would recommend this readily without any hesitation to anyone wishing to read a fun British adventure.  It is truly a book that should be better known.n sense.

Putting your work out there to speak for you.  The criticism of hundreds of thousands of adults just waiting to tear you apart.  It takes even more guts to write a non-fiction picture book.  Now you have to deal with parents passing over your story for, oh I dunno, \\"Mr. Peabody's Apples\\" because they're afraid that they themselves will be bored.  Pompous adults like that.  And finally, it takes a kind of bravery most humans would be lucky to possess to write a non-fiction picture book that sports the word, \\"evolution\\", on its cover.  So please take a moment to mentally applaud the gutsy efforts of one Ms. Lisa Westberg Peters and one Ms. Lauren Stringer for their moxie laden little number, \\"Our Family Tree: An Evolution Story\\".<br />A delicate rendering of Lascaux acrylics on watercolor paper, the story is one of the oldest ones on earth.  Peters begins, \\"All of us are part of an old, old family.  The roots of our family tree reach way back to the beginning of life on earth.  We've changed a lot since then\\".  Slowly we learn about DNA and the birth of cells in the seas.  We hear about oxygen filling the planet and how the seas rose and fell, changing the landscape.  About how animals crawled up onto the land and how after an asteroid our particular branch of the family tree survived.  Finally, the monkeys evolved, and we evolved out of the monkeys.  The book ends with further details for the inquisitive child about each step of the family tree.  A helpful timeline follows these facts at the end.<br />For those human beings that dislike the notion of evolution and prefer a more creation-laden viewpoint, this is not the book for you.  It's pretty darn clear in the text that life began 3,800 to 3,600 million years ago.  End of story.  You will not find a religious note in this book.  It's scientifically written and happy to remain that way.  Not that the facts presented are full-proof.  I may be wrong, but I don't believe the asteroid theory has ever matter-of-factly killed off the dinosaurs as it does here.  Also (as more professional reviewers have pointed out) the timeline really does make it look as if it was just a hop, skip, and a jump from single celled organisms to wormlike vertebrates.<br />On the whole, however, this is a good informative text.  Children reading it should be a little older, in order to fully grasp exactly what is being said.  For them, however, this book serves as an excellent resource.  The pictures are lovely and the facts are mostly on the ball.  A lovely addition to any children's evolution library.eroid theory has ever matter-of-factly killed off the dinosaurs as it does here.

Let it never be said that fantastic female illustrators are a new phenomenon. Margaret Bloy Graham's attention to detail and delightful characters back in the day resulted in this lovely tale of a filthy dog. Perusing the pages of &quot;Harry the Dirty Dog&quot;, the reader is drawn into a delightful story that encompasses all times and all places. It is a story that has stood up well over the years.<br /><br /> Harry is a white dog with black spots who is NOT fond of baths. After hiding his scrub brush and hi-tailing it away from his home, Harry becomes so terribly dirty that he resembles a black dog with white spots. When his own family doesn't recognize him, Harry must take drastic measures to make his way back into the family's heart.<br /><br /> Harry's an adorable little mutt. The book isn't making any intentional social commentary, but I did love the variety of places Harry got into. Look, he's playing near the construction workers! Look, he's down at the railroad! Look, he's sliding down a coal shoot! It's nice to see jobs in a kids book that aren't all posh upper middle class desk occupations. Admittedly, sometimes the book's published date is obvious. Where, after all, are all the black people? Any minority at all? This is a world full of white white whites. Still, how much do you hold a book accountable for such things when it is thoroughly lacking in any other problems?<br /><br /> Harry's family members look like nothing so much as early prototypes of Harry Bliss (the New Yorker cartoonist who wrote the children's book, &quot;Don't Forget to Come Back&quot;), by the way. Those big black Orphan Annie eyes. Altogether, this is a good book for any adult that wants to remember a time tinged in nostalgia. Kids will feel for Harry, just as they are relieved that he makes back home okay in the end. Any child that loves doggies will adore this book. It may even serve those adults that want a story that applauds the virtues of keeping clean. A fine piece of work.ce of work.	2004-03-07

In my own humble opinion, after reading this book, I can't imagine how any other was even seriously considered a contender.  \\"Walk Two Moons\\" is a book as infinitely wise as it is funny.  The rare book that can serve up a rousing good story while teaching you a little about the very nature of life, death, loving and grieving.  This is a book ostensibly written for children but so incredibly mature that after finishing it you just sit staring at the picture of author Sharon Creech on the book flap thinking over and over in your head, \\"How did she do it?  How did she do it?  How did she do it?\\"<br />\\"Walk Two Moons\\" follows the tales and travels of Salamanca (Sal) Tree Hiddle.  Traveling with her parents to Idaho in the hopes of bringing her mother back with her, the juggles two storylines simultaneously.  On the one hand, we have Sal, trying to deal with the fact that her mother left her.  On the other is Sal's story of her friend Pheobe who's own mother up and left her family one day.  While dealing with the painfully realistic reactions children have to such departures on the part of their parents, it also gives us glimpses into families that are rock solid in their love and devotion.  You have Sal's grandparents that are taking the trip to Idaho with her.  As you learn more about them, you realize how wonderful and tragic their life has been, with a deep abiding love.  Also, Sal's friend Mary Lou's family is a rambunctious crew of crazy wonderful people, always messy and always affectionate.<br />Just describing the plot of this book really doesn't do it any justice.  There are just so many things to admire about it.  Through her narrator Creech somehow is able to convey a wisdom that goes beyond Sal's own understandings and words.  Moreover, though Sal is perhaps one of the sanest people in this story, she is also an incredibly unreliable narrator.  I admit, the ending caught me completely off guard.  I should have seen it coming, and I didn't.  This is the kind of book where you have to read it all the way through once, and then read it all the way through a second time just to pick up all the tiny clues you missed the first time.  Along the way, everything from the heart of life to the despair of death is explored carefully and respectfully.  Creech is able to repeatedly bring up the motif of \\"Don't judge a man until you've walked two moons in his moccasins\\", without ever becoming preachy or didactic.  How does she do it?  How is this amazing author able to tie every little metaphor and plot point up so perfectly by the book's end?<br />Critics of the book like to dismiss it for a variety of sins.  They claim it hasn't any strong female characters.  Apparently Mary Lou's working mom doesn't count.  Nor Pheobe's neighbor, a woman who had to deal with the death of her husband and blindness of her mother all on her own.  Nor, for that matter, Sal herself.  An amazingly capable young woman who is not perfect, but contains all the qualities of a person learning what life is all about.  Critics also claim the book is dull.  Sorry, folks.  It ain't.  The book does not suffer from pages of descriptive passages.  The characters speak with zing and verve.  The plot is fascinating.<br />I have only ever read two Newbery winners that I truly felt were some of the best children's books ever written.  The first was Louis Sacher's \\"Holes\\".  The second was Sharon Creech's \\"Walk Two Moons\\".  If you ever read two books intended for kids, I suggest you pick these two without hesitation.

You thought \\"Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel\\" was a tad bit too masculine for your kids?  Then forgo the wonders of \\"I Stink\\".  A rip roaring celebration of the joys of sanitation (THERE's a new word for your kids to learn!) this book follows the daily work of a garbage truck as it makes its daily rounds in the wee hours of the day.  The book is so good natured in its exclamations you just can't help but love it either.  And trust me, the kids will.<br />Here's how the book begins.  No namby-pamby openers for this morning vehicle.  \\"Who am I?  I've got lights. Ten WIDE tires.  No A.C., not me.  I've got doubles: Steering wheels, gas pedals, brakes.  I am totally DUAL OP\\".  You half expect this truck to disintegrate into a series of well-chosen cuss words, it's so certain of its own glory.  Acting more like an Oscar the Grouch in garbage truck form, the dirty monstrosity exhibits its own forms of belching before launching into the ABC's of its morning diet.  A word of warning: don't read this book too early in the morning.  You may find yourself growing nauseous (even as your kids howl for more) reading about fish heads, ugly (stained) underpants, and year-old yams.  The authors aren't squeamish about defecation either.  Here we can clearly see dirty diapers, kitty litter, and puppy poo (not to put too fine a point on it).  The truck then explains how indispensable he (I'm only assuming it's male, but it's a pretty clear guess) is summarizing the predicament we'd be in.  Without the Sanitation Department, \\"You're on Mount Trash-o-rama, baby\\".  Never thought you'd ever hear a garbage truck call you \\"baby\\"?  You obviously could not have predicted this book.<br />The authors are careful to thank not only garbage men Earl Harrington and Billy King in their opening, but also \\"everyone at the New York City Department of Sanitation\\".  It is a fitting tribute, and an excellent book to offer unto them.  Capped off by beautiful endpapers (displaying our friend the Garbage Truck in mesmerizing shades of deep blue and turquoise) this disgusting, smelly, filthy book is a class act through and through.  Kids love it, grown-ups (that aren't prone to sickness) really get into it, and the world is a better place for it.  Garbage workers rarely get their due.  Now, they're not only commended for their work, but lauded as well..

I've enjoyed reading through the vast variety of responses to this book, and mostly they bring up some interesting points. &quot;Go Away Big Green Monster&quot; is ostensibly a book that is meant to (and I'm quoting the back of the book here) &quot;chase away their (kids') nighttime monsters&quot;. All well and good. This doesn't give the book much in the way of plot development or character analysis, but it sure does create one heckuva scary bed time monster. By flipping through the pages the book slowly creates, then disposes with a big green boogie man.<br /><br /> I was a bit amazed at the cut out construction of this tale. It's cleverly done and expertly woven. But as some reviews of this book have pointed out, it's probably a book best written for kids who ALREADY are afraid of big green monsters. If you've a child who's never considered that monsters might be out there with &quot;a big red mouth with sharp white teeth&quot; this might suddenly inspire them to become afraid for the first time. Sort of the antithesis of what the book is supposed to accomplish. I mean, it's a cute book. No question. Just make certain that you're handing it to a little one that is not innocent in the ways of monsters and monster appearance.<br /><br /> Oh, and as a personal side note, I love the cover. The big green monster stares out at the viewer in a perfect Kilroy-esque appearance (his big ole nose hanging like a blue cucumber over the yellow wall). Any book that references Kilroy is a-okay by me.	2004-03-07

A splendid m&eacute;lange of color and cut outs, \\"Beautiful Blackbird\\" is the story of how the birds of the world got their black spots and stripes.  It's not too dissimilar from Rudyard Kiplings Just-So story of \\"How the Leopard Got Its Spots\\" in this way.  When all the multi-colored birds of Africa beg blackbird (the most beautiful of all the birds) to paint some black on them, the able creature readily agrees.  Thus, the world today is filled with birds of every shape and color, all touched by black in some way.<br />No need to go digging for a metaphor here.  The chorus sung by the happy aviary ranges from, \\"Blackbird is the most beautiful one\\" to \\"Black is beautiful, uh-huh!\\".  And these birds know how to dance too.  Here's a lyric from their party:<br /> \\"Tip tap toe to the left, spin around,<br /> Toe tap tip to the right, stroke the ground.<br /> Wings flip-flapping as you glide,<br /> Forward and backward in a Show Claws Slide\\".<br />As always, I must warn you that if you intend to read this book to children you must have at least one musical or rhythmic bone in your body.  This book sports a bouncy catchy beat.  To deny it is to deny much of the nature of the book itself.  A great resource for those parents that want to make it very clear from the beginning that black is the most beautiful color of them all.  It's a color readily shared, though, as Blackbird himself points out, \\"Just remember, whatever I do, I'll be me and you'll be you\\".	2004-03-07

I may be completely wrong in saying this, but I do believe this is the first Caldecott Award winning book to incorporate both English and Spanish phrases in its text.  Taking a sweet story and extending it into a tale of patience and perseverance, author Leo Politi wrote a wonderful intergenerational tale.<br />The story follows Juan, a young boy living in the California town of Capistrano, and Julian, an elderly man who works at the nearby mission.  Juan and Julian get along peachy keen.  In a \\"Secret Garden\\" like turn of events, Juan notices the sparrows in the garden.  Julian teaches the boy their ways and how they leave every fall, only to return on Saint Joseph's Day.  How do the birds know to come back that day?  Says Julian, \\"That I do not know\\".  Juan watches with sadness as the birds leave exactly as Julian said they would, but prepares a small garden at his own house in the hopes of attracting a sparrow family of his own.  When, on a late Saint Joseph's Day, the birds do come back, Juan is delighted to find two of them perched in front of his home as happy as can be.<br />My initial glance at this book was one of disappointment.  At first I found the pictures toneless and flat.  On a second look, however, I realized how nicely they compliment the story.  Sometimes the illustrations are painted in mild greys and pinks around the borders of the pages.  Other times, they are grand colorful two-page spreads displaying everything from a bird's eye view of Juan running into the Mission's enormous gardens to an aerial shot of the countryside as the sparrows wind their way south for the winter.  The illustrations of the sparrows themselves are especially nice.  It is clear that Politi took care to render them realistically and with affection.  I was especially taken with the shots of the two sleeping sparrows cuddled close to one another under a mild pink moon.<br />Most picture books of this age retain something mildly offensive about them.  It's not their fault, necessarily.  They just convey messages we deem irresponsible today.  In this case, the book is mostly politically incorrect-free.  A single exception could be Julian's loving description of the missionaries of California.  According to him they used, \\"to take care of sick Indians\\" as well as bringing them \\"many of the things they needed in their daily life\\".  Frankly, I think the Indians were doing just fine without the supposedly nice missionaries, but this is Julian's story.  I'm sure he believes what he is saying, and I'm quite certain that author Politi does as well.  This section is brief, and has little to do with the rest of the book.  If you find yourself overwhelmingly offended by it, it's the easiest thing in the world to simply skip these pages when reading to the tiny tots.<br />In general, this is a strong story.  Sweet in its storytelling, impressive in its execution, and enjoyable in its use of Spanish, I think it's a tale that resonates as magnificently today as it ever did.  Take the time to discover it, if you can.  Tis a pure expression of the idyllic years of childhood.them.  It's not their fault, necessarily.  They just convey messages we deem irresponsible today.

Certainly you'll find them shuffling around the edges of various Australian based books.  But they're never the heroes.  There was Anita Hewett's charming 1958 concoction, \\"Think, Mr. Platypus\\", but it's a little old.  So FINALLY we find Chris Riddell's 2001 picture book, \\"Platypus\\".  It's a little repetitive and it certainly doesn't explore the lifestyle or appearance of real platypuses (platypusses? platypi?) but for the preschool set this is just the story to be told.<br />A young platypus named... um... Platypus (no real creativity there) sets about his day collecting fun things to add to his special box.  When he comes across a large curly shell, Platypus is certain he has found exactly the object he's been looking for.  After taking it home, however, Platypus finds it missing.  He locates it and brings it back only to find the same thing happen the day after that.  What is going on?<br />The story isn't too complex, that's for certain.  But I can see the occasional child growing quite fond of the rolly-polly little mammal.  Author Chris Riddell draws in a style not too dissimilar from that of early Berkeley Breathed.  There's a real Opus quality to his Platypus character.  The story seems a tad dated.  Aside from two old shoes (one of which is a yellow high top) Platypus seems to have a yen for collecting toys circa 1952.  Marbles, bottle caps, and the like.<br />On the whole, this is not a book that's gonna blow you away.  On the other hand, it's not going to offend you either.  And kids may enjoy figuring out why the shell moves away on Platypus before he himself does.  So while I can find no real reason to dislike \\"Platypus\\", the book is lacking that something extra separates the merely good books from the excellent ones.  For the kid obsessed with Australian animals, this is a good starter story.  For everyone else, you're not going to miss out if you somehow skip this book in your storytime.ry.

Running to tell the king she meets up with a range of different avian types until finally coming to crafty Foxy Loxy.  This 1968 creation undoubtedly won many a supporter back in its day.  A classic story, it deserved a classy set-up.  Unfortunately, the book has not aged as well as it might have.  Illustrator Paul Galdones story is a bit dull for a while, and then it suddenly becomes a little shocking at the end.  In true fairy tale fashion, Foxy Loxy and his brood have a fine feast from their silly feathered friends.  Theres nothing particularly gratuitous about this.  You dont see Henny Penny & Friends actually eaten.  Nor are there any leftover remains when we view the parting shot of Foxy Loxy and his family.  On the other hand, children who (for whatever reason) have grown attached to the silly birds arent going to enjoy the black page that simply reads, From that day to this Turkey Lurkey, Goosey Loosey, Ducky Lucky, Cocky Locky, and Henny Penny have never been seen again.  I dunno.  Maybe Im being too modern.  If the children of the late 1960s could take this book, shouldnt we assume our kids can today?<br />Perhaps.  On the other hand, theres no getting around the fact that the book is (forgive me, but it is true) not particularly well illustrated.  Its not badly illustrated, mind you.  Just the same, the pictures arent anything to crow about.  Theyre flat.  Colored occasionally in red, green or yellow.  The three color palette may suit some, but it does grow a little wearisome to the wandering eye.

A book that secretly promotes the benefits of \\"yummy vegetables\\" without drumming the lesson into the heads of innocent children!  Candace Fleming has penned a fun frolicsome tale of bunnies, gardeners, and ingenious methods of munching.  In this tale, Mr. McGreely (why is it that bunnies always run into conflicts with men sporting Irish or Scottish names?) decides to fill his tiny backyard plot with vegetables of his own growing.  As his veggies grow, however, three inspired rabbits set about eating the delicious greens.  The more complex Mr. McGreely's defenses grow (walls, moats, and eventually an enormous maximum security system that defies belief) the more adept the bunnies become at scaling, burrowing, and otherwise getting past the blockages.<br />It's a little amazing that Mr. McGreely even HAS any vegetables left at the end of the tale, if the bunnies are so doggone hungry.  I half expected the moral of the story to disintegrate into some preachy morality tale where Mr. McGreely learns that walls may keep out the bunnies but they also keep out the sun and the veggies die.  As it happens, veggies aren't particularly upset by walls, though it becomes clear that Mr. McGreely truly has built them in vain.  This is really just a classic story of the little guys beating the big guy through style and cunning.<br />Candace Flemings text is jumpy and bouncy (just like the hares themselves).  Here's a two page spread of the text accompanying pictures of bunnies swimming the moat, scaling the walls, and settling down to eat.<br />\\"Tippy-tippy-tippy, pat!<br />Dive-paddle, splash! Splash! Splash!<br />Dig-scrabble,<br />Scratch! Scratch! Scratch!<br />Spring-hurdle,<br />Dash! Dash! Dash!<br />Muncha! Muncha! Muncha!\\"<br />That's catchy stuff.  Sadly, I wasn't as taken by G. Brian Karas's illustrations.  They're cute enough, sure.  Just not particularly grabbing.  The three bunnies are fairly indistinguishable from one another, save for their different colored shirts.  The pictures don't really detract from the reading but they don't add anything either.  My advice is, come for the nice story and catchy phrases.  Stay for the messages about carrots being nummy!The pictures don't really detract from the reading but they don't add anything either.  My advice is, come for the nice story and catchy phrases.

And of these, 99% are just awful.  Really terribly written wish fulfillment stories in which the characters are poorly fleshed out, the prose is repugnant, and the book itself a minor (or major) disgrace to that author.  Which is why The Woman In the Wall is so wonderfully extraordinary.  Patrice Kindl has taken a plot that millions of children would be able to identify with and has fleshed it out, given it new life and verve, and written a fiction story that I would have KILLED to read at the age of nine or ten.  This is a wonderful and little acknowledged tale.<br />Anna is shy.  Not the kind of shy where people blush when theyre spoken to in public by strangers.  More the kind of shy where people would rather build an entire world within their own home so as to avoid coming into contact with even their most beloved family members.  When young Anna is told that shell have to attend school soon, she uses her wits and cunning to fashion a living space for herself within the walls of her home.  It is only when she finds a mysterious love letter pushed underneath one of the walls of her home that she must decide whether to make contact, or whether to continue to hide away.<br />The premise is fairly light.  Any child that has ever felt a need to blend in with their surroundings will gravitate to such a tale.  But Kindl has actually gone a step further.  This is also a story of growing from childhood into adolescence.  As Anna grows and learns, so too does her own body.  She finds herself a young teenager with hormones just as raging as any other girls.  Furthermore, in the course of this relatively short story (my edition was a scant 185 pages) Anna learns not only to confront the world but also to deal with the disappearance of her own father.  The book is an allegory for growing up and making the world notice you.  It is also the tale of how, for many, childhood is not a time to revel in, but a time to avoid until you reach an age where things are just a little better.  Kindl discusses all these topics AS WELL as working in a clever lunar moth metamorphosis metaphor as well.  All this, and its a fun read.<br />Someday I will write a list of the 100 childrens books every human being should at least have a passing understanding of.  The Woman In the Wall will not be number one on that list.  It will not be number two.  It certainly wont make it into the top 20.  But it will be on that list, and anyone who has ever felt the insanity of adolescence would do well to pick it up, read it through, and discuss it with their friends.ldhood is not a time to revel in, but a time to avoid until you reach an age where things are just a little better.

Author Louise Erdrich, a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Ojibwa, has written a story of 1847 Ojibwa life.  The book is truly a labor of love, including such amazing elements as a detailed map of the area in which her story takes place, a glossary of terms, and multiple sources considered during the writing of this tale.  Even more, the book is a compact series of small vignettes of standard Ojibwa life, crushing stereotypes and myths with sure swift prose.  Erdrich has written a story that has truly created its own separate niche.<br />Omakayas (or Little Frog) lives in a sturdy birchbark house in a land doomed one day to become Wisconsin.  With her family we see her step through the paces of day to day existence.  The book encompasses a single year in Omakayas's life; one filled with as much terror and despair as love and hope.  Helping her family to battle smallpox, find food in a desperate winter, and deal with the small details imperative to survival, we watch Omakayas grow from an uncertain young girl to a competent, if still learning, young woman.<br />The book is almost an answer to the Laura Ingels Wilder tales.  Truth be told, the two titles have much in common.  Both deal implicitly with Native American/white settler relations.  Both look at the details of daily life, realistically describing everything from food preparation to parties.  Even the illustrations of the book (drawn by author Erdrich herself) bear a great resemblance to the Garth Williams' pics we remember so well from the Little House books.  But Erdrich has the benefit of hindsight and (let's face it) superior knowledge concerning the ways of both the whites and the Ojibwa.  Her writing expertly allows her to create interesting variegated personalities that trump the one-dimensional stick figure Indians Wilder relied on so heavily.  These characters have a harsh, but really great life.  There's the buffoon, Albert LaPautre (half French) who continually claims to have had meaningful visions and dreams.  There's Old Tallow, a powerful woman of her own means, surrounded by a pack of wolf-dogs and wearing coats woven from a variety of different furs.  And then there's Omakayas herself, dreaming true visions and meeting true woodland creatures, even going so far as to train a crow of her own.<br /><br />The books ends with this sentence, \\"Omakayas tucked her hands behind her head, lay back, closed her eyes, and smiled as the song of the white-throated sparrow sank again and again through the air like a shining needle, and sewed up her broken heart\\".  It's an ending that contains a lot of hope for the future.  Erdrich does not dwell on the fate that may lay in store for Omakayas and her beloved family.  We know what will happen.  It's enough to see them happy at this moment alone.  \\"The Birchbark House\\" is a courageous creation, one that I'm certain will please even the most merciless of Erdrich's critics.  Full of well rounded characters, a gripping plot, and wonderful tangents it's one of the best ways to introduce kids to a different time and place.ad meaningful visions and dreams.

This is not the book you are looking for.  Yes, both books were published in 2003.  Yes, they are both picture books.  But though this may seem a tempting purchase, you would be mistaken to lay down your cold hard cash for it.  If, on the other hand, you know perfectly well which book this is (thank you very much) then I invite you to read my humble review.<br />Meet Johnny MacGuffin, a boy with a permanent curl-lick of the bangs and round horn-rimmed somewhat-Harry-Potterish glasses who is in a predicament.  His mother has left him in the basement of an enormous Marshall-Fieldsesque store with his aunt while she goes shopping for, \\"just a minute\\".  Johnny's concept of time flutters and fails him in this time period, and while she is gone he imagines (panic-striken all the while) that years have passed.  One minute it's Christmas.  The next, he's grown a beard.  Next (and most improbably) he's, \\"gotten married, had five kids, and bought a house on the hill, waiting in Bindle's department store\\".  Love the goatee.  Finally, after he's become a grey-haired old man, his mother appears again looking faaaaabulous.  Johnny is once more a child and the two set off for... more shopping.<br />There's no denying the vivacity of this book.  When Johnny isn't pressing his nose to the windows of the store he's drowning in a strange sea as the sun burns, \\"to a cinder of vermilion\\".  The colors are bright and lively and the illustrations well composed.  Details (like Johnny's glasses suddenly becoming bifocals when he's an old man) will continually catch your eye.  Kids might enjoy finding the odd large-beaked bird that appears in the oddest of moments throughout the tale.<br /><br />But I was not overwhelmingly impressed.  Here's the deal:  Though Johnny may only be pretending that he's growing old as his mother is upstairs, it's unclear that this is all (in some odd way) a dream.  When the very store itself crumbles from the force of an earthquake, kids are going to wonder how and why it's happening.  Moreover, when Johnny's mother reappears and everything looks exactly the way it was... heck I was confused for a while.  Why does Johnny need to learn, \\"how to walk again\\" at the end?  Why, when he's told at the end that there will be more shopping, do his hands suddenly quake and steam?  I know this is all a metaphor for how children feel when their adults abandon them for the supposed \\"minute\\" but couldn't this have been conveyed with a little more clarity?  In the end, the book's going to raise a lot more questions than it could ever answer.  The literal minded child will not take to this book.<br />The open-minded child just may like this story, however.  If you've a hankering for a tale that displays a childish mindset in the face of abandonment, this might be the book you'd like.  But if it isn't, don't be too surprised.  It may simply be a matter of taste.unclear that this is all (in some odd way) a dream.

Books	5	29	33	N	N	Cookie cookie cookie starts with C	\\"If You Give a Mouse a Cookie\\" really has been the \\"It\\" book for some time.  Parents love this story, and their children really get into it as well.  On and off, I'd heard various things about it, but nothing that so sparked my interest that I ran to my nearest library to peruse its pages.  Now, however, I've grown old and wise in the ways of kiddie lit. and I found myself wanting to know what all the fuss was about.  Was this book really as overwhelmingly fantastic as everyone said?  Was I doomed to fall desperately in love with it like 98% of the population of known Western Civilization?  The answer is a resounding yes yes yes.  I had counted on finding some mild enjoyment with a fun story.  Was I got was extreme enjoyment from a sly, understated, exceedingly clever story.<br />As we open, a small mouse treks down a hill on its own as a boy contentedly reads his comic book, munching on a bag of delicious chocolate chip cookies.  After the boy offers the mouse a cookie (not knowing what such an action has wrought) the mouse asks for milk.  Milk leads to a napkin.  A napkin leads to a mirror (to check for a milk mustache, of course).  A mirror leads to a hasty haircut.  A haircut leads to sweeping up.  And so on.  All the while the boy gamely follows his rodent friend over, around, and through the different parts of the house, ever supplying the guest with whatsoever it may require.  By the end, the house is in shambles, the boy exhausted on the floor (parents will relish this picture above all) and the mouse has just started in on a second cookie.<br />Some books expertly place kids in the position of their parents.  In the picture book, \\"Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus\\", kids are allowed to finally tell someone (the someone in that instance being a naughty pigeon) no.  In this book, the kids are now the patient parents, forever cleaning up and amusing the endlessly enthusiastic and hepped-up mousey.  The pictures are deceptively simple, drawn with pure pen and ink.  Just the same, millions of tiny details are apparent in every shot.  The boy's refrigerator displays (oddly) a newspaper clipping of a car crash.  The mouse's drawing of his family displays some pretty original dresses on his mother and sister.  And I'll leave up to your imagination the variety of odds n' ends surrounding the depleted boy at the end of the story.  Suffice to say, ladies and gentlemen, this book has it all.  And it's a delightful story to boot.ink.  Just the same, millions of tiny details are apparent in every shot.  The boy's refrigerator displays (oddly) a newspaper clipping of a car crash.

765028:US	49148452	R3QB4VO01B62UG	044040830X	112488870	The Little Island (Dell Picture Yearling)	Books	3	10	17	N	N	The weather started getting rough....	Published just after the end of World War II, \\"The Little Island\\" garnered itself a prestigious Caldecott medal for exemplary plot and illustrations in a picture book.  Looking at it today, I'm a little surprised.  The book does have a sweet little story.  Describing the daily events that occur on a small island in the beautiful blue ocean, the story eventually focuses its attention on a black kitten that visits the island for a while.  The kitten explores and speaks with the island and its fish, discovering the nature of, \\"how all land is one land under the sea\\".  In the end, the kitten leaves and the island is subject to the wild storms and animals that seek its shores.<br />I like the story of the kitten and I like the words Golden MacDonald has chosen to convey nature's mysteries.  \\"The cat's eyes were shining with the secret of it.  And because he loved secrets he believed. And he let the fish go\\".  So no quarrel here with the text.  Top notch.  Two thumbs up.  It's the illustrations I have a bone to pick with.<br />When you think of the fine illustrators of the past, geniuses like Robert McCloskey or James Thurber come to mind.  Less likely to appear in one's brain is a Mr. Leonard Weisgard.  In creating this book, Weisgard begins strongly.  The opening pages reveal a black and white kingfisher smiling benignly at the viewer.  The little island, obviously somewhat close to North American shores due to its pine trees and native plants, is rendered lovingly in the first few spreads.  But then the descriptions increase and the pictures do not compliment the words.  We are told that, \\"Small flowers, white and blue and violets with golden eyes and little waxy white-pink chuckleberry blossoms and one tickly smelling pear tree bloomed on the Island\\".  Great.  Now where are they?  Because in the picture facing these descriptions we see one tree with white yellow blossoms (not white-pink), some small flowers that are white, blue, red, and violet (but NOT violet with golden eyes), and not a pear tree anywhere in sight.  Hm.  Eventually we come to a picture of two kingfishers preparing, supposedly, to build nests.  This may have been the illustrator's intent, and perhaps I have a dirty mind, but I have never seen a clearer picture of a male kingfisher mounting a female kingfisher atop a dead tree.  So there's bird sex to contend with as well. Not the illlustrator's purpose, but an undeniable image.  oog.<br />Finally, we get to the little kitten and all attempts at composition and proportion go flying out the window, never to return.  The kitten is, from the first shot, about half the size of its humans.  Then it leaps into the air and appears to be flying over the island.  Next, it catches a fish, its legs having shrunk into its body so that it now looks to be one of those cats bred to have purposefully short legs.  In the end, the cat leaves (thank goodness) and we return to some interesting illustrations that bear little or no resemblance to the text that author Golden MacDonald took such pains to write.<br />There's great danger in critiquing books of a certain age.  People who grew up loving \\"The Little Island\\" will not want this book to be so poorly reviewed.  But if you pull away the sentiment and look at this story with cool clear eyes you will see that it is the unfortunate pairing of an excellent author with an inferior illustrator.  It is an interesting book, there is no question.  But today it cannot be considered anything but a sub-par Caldecott finalist.golden eyes), and not a pear tree anywhere in sight.  Hm.

Would someone PLEASE take the time and effort to tell me exactly why it is that I had never heard of this book until the good people of the New York Public Library placed it on their, \\"100 Picture Books Every Child Should Know\\"???  Why isn't this book being handed out to every kindergartner that walks into school on their first day?  Why isn't there a \\"Farmer Duck\\" Day where we all get to take off work and revel in the sublime pleasures of this text?  And why, oh why oh why, was this book never recommended to me in any way, shape, or form?  Ladies and gentlemen, I place the blame fully on a nation in which Madonna can create best-selling children's books because, according to her, there are NO good books for her kids (I'm having a hard time typing as I gag), while my beloved, \\"Farmer Duck\\" remains a small perfect gem in a sea of terrible literature.  But I digress.<br />\\"Farmer Duck\\" follows the unlikely premise of a duck that runs a farm all by his lonesome.  The actual farmer in charge of the place is a lazy no good so-and-so who would rather eat bon bons in bed than take the time to do any work.  While the man relaxes in his shirtless luxury (occasionally shouting out a helpful, \\"How goes the work?\\") the duck cuts the wood, weeds the gardens, washes the dishes, irons the clothing, and pretty much does everything that needs doing.  When at long last the duck grows, \\"sleepy and weepy and tired\\" (what a great way to describe any child that has gone too long without a nap, by the way), the other farm animals decide that enough is enough.  Joining forces they run that rotten farmer out of town and set about all doing the chores equally with the duck in charge.<br />The plot is good.  The illustrations are brilliant.  Illustrator Helen Oxenbury (thank you, oh England, for sending us such a talented artist) has taken watercolor to a whole new level.  In a scene as rife with melodrama as any film noir, we see the sheep, the chickens, and the cow walking into the farm house just before dawn.  Those moments before the sun has risen have never been so expertly rendered on paper until now.  Oxenbury has created subtle gradations of grey and white, steeping the scene in a fuzzy day-for-night that is absolutely stunning.  And the details!  If you examine the scene closely you can see three watching sheep (one with head relaxing on its front hoofs) as the intrepid heroes creep away together.  I'm sorry, but my written abilities are inadequate in describing this scene.  Suffice to say, it's gorgeous.<br />What a relief to finally read a farm story in which the animals really like one another (though, technically, the farmer is the most animal-like of them all).  In the canon of ducks-as-heroes picture books, place this story squarely on the shoulders of the funny \\"Duck on a Bike\\" and \\"Make Way For Ducklings\\".  Any child that wants to know anything about farming will do well to read this book.  I'm gushing, and I don't care.  It's the best farm story ever drawn.  You will enjoy every second of reading it.  And that's all I have to say about that.chickens, and the cow walking into the farm house just before dawn.

Perhaps Mars was rising in the Pisces and all the stars were in correct alignment when it happened.  Perhaps it was predicted by a seer decades before it could actually occur.  Or maybe it was just one of those strokes of luck that produce books of pure perfection without ever meaning to.  Whatever the reason, in the end their collaborative \\"The Fortune Tellers\\" is what you would expect of two geniuses.  It is perfect.<br />The story concerns a young man who wishes to seek his fortune and escape the drudgery of carpentry.  After visiting a fortune teller the young man is convinced he will someday attain wealth, love, and long life.  But on returning to the fortune teller's lair later, he finds the old man gone and people mistaking HIM for a fortune teller.  In the end, he gains everything he ever wanted by telling people a caveat-laden series of predictions.<br />The story is nice and funny.  It's told well and children will get the key to the fortunes easily on their own.  But honestly, this book could have been made or broken by its illustrator.  In the wrong hands it could easily have gone beyond poorly drawn into offensive.  Therefore, we should all give a great big sigh of relief that it was instead placed in the capable and multi-talent hands of Ms. Hyman.<br />Basing her pictures in Cameroon (a land where her son-in-law was originally from), Hyman has produced a plethora of drop-dead gorgeous drawings.  Says Hyman in her bio about this creation, the book is illustrated with her, \\"memories of the incredible beauty, strength, and diversity of the landscape and people of Cameroon\\".  Certainly the landscapes are lovely.  From fields of grassland, mountain ranges, and wooded boulevards it stuns.  But I was most taken with the people in this book.  Honestly, I don't know how Hyman did it.  Every single woman in this book is wearing several different printed cloths.  Every man is different from every other.  Every baby completely easy to distinguish from every other.  If you want to be blown away, you don't even have to open the darned book.  Just turn it over and look at the group of ten people standing on the back cover.  From the coy baby to the pair of brothers to the girls that regard the viewer with matter-of-fact eye contact, I was just stunned.  And I haven't even begun to tell you about the millions of tiny details in EVERY single picture.  There are hundreds of things to discover.  For example, the old fortune teller owns a French to English dictionary propped up in his bed.  Small lizards are identifiable in almost every picture if you care to seek them out. Observe also the interactions between friends and neighbors.  Amazing.<br />My words are inadequate.  This book deserves every drop of attention you have to spare.  Kids will love it.  Adults will feast their eyes on every scene.  It is the most beautiful of Hyman's creations, and truly an effective labor of love.  I adore this book.d cloths.

Observe also the interactions between friends and neighbors.  Amazing.<br />My words are inadequate.  This book deserves every drop of attention you have to spare.  Kids will love it.  Adults will feast their eyes on every scene.  It is the most beautiful of Hyman's creations, and truly an effective labor of love.  I adore this book.	2004-02-29

Forever to be doomed to the non-fiction section of the library where, occasionally, a student will pull one out to help with their school's science project.  I've always found children's scientific picture books to be especially depressing little creations.  More often than not they're drawn or illustrated in such a way that their messages go out of date, even as their science remains correct.  Fortunately for us all, I don't think this will be the fate of \\"I Face the Wind\\".  True, it's trendy.  But it is also such a nice little compilation of facts and experiments that I hope it doesn't disappear too quickly in the unused library shelves for all time.<br />The book begins with a \\"Note to the Reader\\".  That reader, as it happens, is actually the adult who will be reading this book with their child.  The note implores \\"readers\\" to allow their children to first read about the experiments and then find their own results before moving on in the book.  This might get a little tedious if the experiments were vast complicated affairs.  Fortunately, author Vicki Cobb has limited experiment materials to those objects people already have around their house(tape, wire hangers, etc.).  No experiment is dangerous and none of them require adult supervision in any way.<br />The book is sort of an Intro. to Science for younger children.  Kids will enjoy the bright colorful illustrations.  Each scene takes place across a pure white background, occasionally dotted by a window or a tree.  The pictures will certainly date in 5 to 10 years down the road, but if you want something that will make your kids interested in science NOW, then this is the book for you.  And hey, it won the Robert F. Sibert Honor in 2004!  If you're brave enough to take a chance introducing your kids to a little well wrought non-fiction, this here's a good starter book for them to consider.	2004-02-29

Sometimes authors can be separated into \\"Authors That End Their Depressing Book Hopefully\\" and \\"Authors That End Their Books In Deep Dark Dank Despair\\".  Robert Cormier is of the latter category.  In his remarkable, \\"I Am the Cheese\\", Cormier tells the technically adept tale of Adam Farmer.  Cutting between scenes in which Adam tries to remember the events of his past and scenes of him riding his bike on a small quest to find his father, the book is a deft portrayal of what is real and what is imagined.<br />More than anything else, this is one of the rare psychological thrillers written specifically for youth.  As Adam realizes what has happened to him, so too does the reader.  And as Adam starts to mistrust his interrogator, ditto the reader.  Clues to Adam's past come to him slowly, their subtlety impressive.  For example, Adam discovers that his has two birth certificates.  One says his correct birthday.  The other, a birth date in a completely different month.  This is a small discovery on his part, but a perfectly chilling one.  He doesn't understand the significance of this discovery, nor does the reader, but we're compelled to discover what it all means.<br />If you've a kid who'd be interested in a book with an unreliable narrator, you couldn't do much better than this.  Adam is sympathetic, but ultimately not in control of any of the forces that guide his travels.  He is the world's victim, a fact explored fully at the novel's shocking close.  DO NOT read the last page of this book if you want to be surprised.  I, myself, caught an accidental glance and knew more than I ever wanted to as a result.  This is not a book for anyone who likes their protagonist to overcome his/her personal struggles and triumph in some small way in the end.  Nor is it a book for those who like the protagonist to use his/her brains to outwit his/her enemies and triumph in the end.  This is more a book for those who like their protagonist to be helpless in the face of an unspeakable accepted evil and who will not triumph in any way at all in the end.  Not your cup of tea?

Not so \\"The Big Snow\\".  A delicate little Caldecott winner, the tale told is not particularly new or deep.  But it's a charmer, no question about it.<br />The story follows various woodland creatures as they prepare for the winter months ahead.  Though a couple birds fly south and several mammals prepare their burrows, the majority of furry folk decide they won't have to worry about making it through the winter.  When a huge snowfall occurs, however, it takes the kind ministrations of two snow-suited humans to feed the hungry animals.<br />As a story, it's fine.  Nothing particularly good or bad about it.  Gardeners reading this tale will cringe inwardly when they hear a mama rabbit (suspiciously named \\"Mrs. Cottontail\\") instructing her child to eat the cabbage and carrots in the garden.  Similarly, the meadow mouse that lives in tunnels that \\"led to sweet plant roots and to the tulip bulbs in the garden\\" may seem cute but explain that to the men and women who sweat and strained to plant those bulbs in the first place.<br />It's the illustrations that really give this book a life of its own.  Each little furry or winged animal is rendered realistically without sacrificing any adorableness.  The baby rabbit munching on carrot tops comes particularly to mind.  Black and white pen and ink drawings (or perhaps they're pencil...) contrast nicely with full page color spreads.  This heightens the tension in the scenes.  The first glance of the countryside bathed in heaps of snowfall is a color shoot.  Likewise, the scrambling of the animals to eat the breadcrumbs spread by the nice human couple.  On the other hand, scenes of the field mice dancing in the silvery light of the moon are charmingly rendered.  They are undoubtedly the best thing in the book.  And the humans here are well drawn.  Sometimes artists that know their ways around animals have a very difficult time drawing people.  Not so here.  In fact the book flap informs us that Mr. and Mrs. Hader (the authors) purposefully made the humans themselves.  In fact, there's a charming shot of the two of them, snow shovels in hand, on the copyright page.<br />If you live in a climate where an abundance of snow is a regular wintertime occurrence (paging Minnesota), kids will like seeing what the animals of the woods do.  If you live in a temperate climate with balmy breezes and mild winters (paging Arizona) you may find the children who read this fascinated by the myriad of different ways snow can affects creatures from all walks of life.  This is a beautiful story, lovingly rendered.  Enjoy at your leisure.ys around animals have a very difficult time drawing people.  Not so here.

The father of the delicately shaded picture book, his stories always contain simple plots and a bundle of warmth.  \\"Make Way For Ducklings\\" (which battles with \\"Blueberries For Sal\\" for the title Best-Known-McCloskey-Story) is one of the author's strongest efforts.  Bringing elements of rural and urban life together, it not only tells a great tale but remains timeless in its telling.<br />The story follows Mr. & Mrs. Mallard, a realistically portrayed duck couple.  No animals in funny clothes here.  The two settle on a small metropolitan island to lay their eggs.  Once hatched it's up to Mrs. Mallard and her troop to walk to their new home in the central park with the help of their local police force.<br />In the sixty some odd years since its publication, \\"Make Way For Ducklings\\" has remained exactly the same.  The closest it comes to dating itself (aside from the stately cars and \\"lending library\\") is that Mr. Mallard abandons his family to fly ahead to the save island.  That's one way of looking at it.  Another way is to point out that Mrs. Mallard is a capable mother who knows exactly how to lead her small brood.  The book is fun, diverting, and illustrated beautifully.  It does not pretend to be anything it isn't.  It is the classic above all other classics.  And it is McCloskey's greatest invention.	2004-02-22

If you haven't a rhythmic bone in your body, you'd best not be reading \\"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom\\" anytime soon.  This book is arguably the best known alphabet book on the market today.  Telling a tale of alphabetic foolhardiness, a troop of lower case letters (all of them, in fact) go bounding up the nearby coconut tree for a variety of reasons.  When the tree can no longer support their weight the little letters find themselves splayed out on the ground.  Fortunately the big letters come along to comfort the little ones, though it's obvious by the end that not all have learned their lesson.<br />Verses of the letters' exploits are intermixed with chants like so;<br />\\"Chicka chick boom boom!<br /> Will there be enough room?<br />Here comes H<br />Up the coconut tree\\"<br />The text has a nice rhythmic quality to it.  A kind of onomatopoetic elegance.  And the illustrations, while not particularly stunning, fulfill their purpose excellently.  It's a good read-aloud story for kids learning their alphabet, and would fit into any storytime excellently.  A fun feisty book.	2004-02-22

I don't know a darned thing about imperial Japan in the 12th century.  So I really don't know if author Katherine Paterson meticulously studied the history and language properly.  And I don't know if this book is the very essence and spirit of all things Japanese.  All that I know is what I read in this book.  A portrait of a spoiled samurai's daughter, \\"Of Nightingales That Weep\\" traces her journey from potter's field to palace to exile with Japan's royal family.<br />The book doesn't begin particularly well.  The kid who wants to read this book has first to stumble through a page describing the correct pronunciation of Japanese names and, following that, a long section dedicated to the historical figures presented in the book.  Kids reading this must wade through sentences like, \\"This intense rivalry came to its first climax during the Hogen Insurrection (1156-1159), which found the two clans supporting opposing elements within the Imperial household\\".  I myself had more than a little difficulty getting through this section, and I'm 25.  When at last, however, I stumbled through I finally got to the story itself.  I can't help but wonder if the Historical Note containing this information wouldn't have been better suited to exist at the end of the story.  That way, kids wouldn't immediately be put off by a complicated set of rivalries and battles of which they do not care, yet.  Once they've read the story, the notes would serve to give a little background.  And you really don't need these notes to read the book.  I read the notes first and I couldn't keep track of what was going on anyway.  Lord help the ten-year-old who does the same.<br />The story itself is interesting.  Protagonist Takiko is proud but also given a strong point of view.  Readers will sympathize with her, even as she displays disgusting shows of self-interest.  Her callous rejection of her step-father, her dismissal of all servants, etc.  Takiko eventually finds herself supporting the royal family and fleeing with them from angry warlords.  As she does, she finds herself falling in love with the enemy... a man as vain as herself.  Paterson adeptly draws you to Takiko's point of view, but it's difficult not to despise her when her own wants overwhelm the needs of her family.  In the end, the moral of the story is a bit askew.  As far as I can tell it boils down to, \\"Be good or eventually you'll have to bear the child of your deformed step-father\\".  Oog.<br />Sex and death opponents, beware.  Though sex is never described in much detail (the most we get are suggestive poems about bird's nests and scenes that end right before the supposed act) but there are a couple moments where Takiko understands that she's being hit on (at fifteen) and must either lure the man on or find ways to break it off.  And the violence is a little less harrowing that the sheer amount of death.  Boy oh boy do a lot of people die in this puppy!<br />I love Katherine Paterson.  I loved \\"The Great Gilly Hopkins\\" and \\"Road to Terebithia\\".  I like her style and the pace she takes with her books.  Quite frankly, however, I can't whole-heartedly recommend this one.  Though it does give a new look at life within imperial Japan, the way in which it is written is not going to necessarily interest the kiddie set.  Read it if it really interests you.

In her author's note, Kathleen Krull points out that Cesar Chavez continues to remain a controversial figure in the United States today.  The fact of the matter is, he followed perfectly in the footsteps of the men he admired; St. Francis of Assisi, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, and Gandhi.  Helping to lead migrant workers in the first successful agricultural strike the U.S. had ever known, he is best remembered worldwide as a hero.  In her book, Krull follows Chavez from a happy early childhood in Arizona to an unpleasant shift to the fields of California.  As we watch, Cesar grows from a boy forced to endure the humiliations of the fields (and the poor schooling as well) to a man capable to leading workers in a non-violent protest against the grape growers of Southern California.  Especially impressive are the ways in which Krull ties in young Cesar's lessons about life (his mother cautioning him to use one's head to work through conflicts) with their actual implementation years later.  Illustrated by Yuyi Morales, the book looks like nothing so much as Jonah Winter's fabulous biography of Frida Kahlo.  Beautiful surreal images meld with sweeping panoramas of a life of difficulty.  You'll find yourself reading it over and over again just to look at the pretty pictures.<br />The fact of the matter is, there's not a single misstep in this book.  Anyone familiar with the previous Pura Belpre winner, \\"Esperanza Rising\\" will see that this book succeeds where \\"Esperanza\\" was apt to fail.  But, quite frankly, it's unfair to compare the two.  Fiction will always pale in comparison to well-written non-fiction.  In this book you have an honest story told simply with an elegance all its own.	2004-02-22

In this day and age there's an abundance of sly hip little books like \\"Olivia\\" or \\"Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus\\" everywhere you look.  But clever picture books are by no means a new creation.  I invite you to take a gander at the 1940s Caldecott winner, \\"Many Moons\\".  If you don't find it the most sublime little work of art, I daresay I'll eat my hat.<br />In this story a little princess of ten years (going on eleven) become ill from eating, \\"a surfeit of raspberry tarts\\".  The only cure she wishes for is for someone to get her the moon.  Her father, the king, calls in his cleverest advisors, but no one can think of a way to bring the princess the moon.  The court jester comes up with the answer, though by the end of the tale it is the princess who has shown true wisdom.<br />Author James Thurber is as equally well known for his witty cartoons in the \\"New Yorker\\" as he is for his books and articles.  In this little gem he has taken his audience down a notch.  Recognizing that wit and long words are just as appropriate for a five year old as a person of fifty, the book contains a series of delightful asides and ideas.  For example, after listing his brilliant accomplishments to the king, the Royal Wizard points out that he also gave the king a cloak of invisibility.<br /> \\"It didn't work,\\" said the King.  \\"The cloak of invisibility didn't work.\\"<br /> \\"Yes, it did,\\" said the Royal Wizard.<br /> \\"No, it didn't,\\" said the King. \\"I kept bumping into things, the same as ever.\\"<br /> \\"The cloak is supposed to make you invisible,\\" said the Royal Wizard.  \\"It is not supposed to keep you from bumping into things.\\"<br /> \\"All I know is, I kept bumping into thing,\\" said the King.<br />That's the kind of stuff I'm talking about.  It's funny.  It's well-thought out.  And it's a joy to read.  Coupled with a series of splendid illustrations by Louis Slobodkin (whose style is suspiciously reminiscent of Thurber's own) the text is complimented excellently.  If you're ready to read words to your children that consist of lines like, \\"midgets, and mermaids, frankincense, ambergris, and myrrh\\", then you're in good hands with this author.  To be perfectly frank, rather than write this review I'd love to just copy down the entire book word for word and show you myself how good it is.  But then you wouldn't see the pretty pictures and this WAS a Caldecott winner, after all.  So I'm just going to have to trust that you understand how supremely good this book is and that you'll rush right out this very minute and get it for yourself.

For those cave dwellers amongst you who've finally crept out of your hermit-like existences to gain a little knowledge about the wide world of children's picture books, the name \\"Eric Carle\\" will be unknown to you.  For everyone else in the universe, however, Mr. Carle is undoubtedly one of the best known illustrators of the Western world.  The father of \\"The Very Hungry Caterpillar\\" and the more recent \\"Slowly Slowly Slowly Said the Sloth\\", his earlier work, \\"Brown Bear\\", is a sweet simple storyline that remains timeless.<br />In this story, different animal characters, cut cleverly from a dazzling array of colored papers, tell the viewer what it is that they see.  The cat sees a dog, the dog sees a sheep, the sheep sees a goldfish, etc.  Now when I said this story was timeless, I wasn't kidding.  Honestly, I'm having a great deal of difficulty finding ANYTHING about this story that's going to date it in one or two hundred years down the road.  Originally published in 1967, the book is particularly impressive because of the shot of children it cuts to towards the end.  Suddenly the viewer is observing kids of a myriad of races and skin tones.  In 1967.  And these are not your white-kids-painted-brown type pictures either.  And they're not all just black or white!  There's the most surprising thing of all, to my mind.  In an age when illustrators were having a devil of a time remembering to even include black kids in the occasional book, here we have a book that is including everything from Asian to Native American children, front and center.<br />On a completely unrelated side-note, the mother in this book bears a striking resemblance to a LOT of very hip mommies these days.  From her dark rimmed Harry Potteresque glasses to her well coiffed hair, this is a mother on the go.<br />To be perfectly blunt, I'm not an Eric Carle fan.  He bores me, and I have distinct memories of finding \\"The Hungry Caterpillar\\" annoying as a child.  But at the same time I'm having a lot of difficulty finding anything at all wrong with this book.  It's not the most exciting picture book on the market today.  It will not grab you, necessarily.  It doesn't demand the spotlight or find itself in intellectual discussions about the nature of animal representation for the pre-adolescent set.  It's just a good book with a nice plot and pretty pictures that teach kids about colors and animals.

In this story, a boy's handicap becomes a strength, and then an unwanted power.  Following the adventures of a Native American boy, the story explores the nature of desire and our own darkness.  The book was, in my opinion, well written and at no point relied on stereotypes.  The book's Native Americans are never named, and this makes perfect sense.  It reminds of that play, \\"Fifth of July\\", where an old hippie remarks that Eskimos call themselves \\"the people\\" and everyone else, \\"the other people\\".  To which his co-horts exclaim, \\"Of course they say that.  Everyone says that!\\".  This came to mind while reading this book.  I liked it.  I liked the plot and the characters.  I liked the odd jealousy the weroance had for her brother, and how the book didn't condemn her for it.  I liked the descriptions of the land of water the most.  I wasn't particularly taken with the magical realism concerning the disappearance of Gray Fire, but then it wasn't a bad way of presenting his disappearance.  In the end, it's a strong story with a couple odd twists and turns.  It would read aloud very well, and could pair with \\"A Boy Called Slow\\" as a story of a boy becoming a man.	2004-02-22

This tale follows the trials and tribulations of a young girl (Beetle) in early medieval times.  Finding herself apprenticed to the local midwife, the girl learns the tricks of the trade, even while gaining a little more wit and confidence in herself.  The heroine is ignorant at the beginning and, quite realistically, does not suddenly end the book with a head full of knowledge and wisdom in everything she does.  The arc of this book is especially remarkable.  Following Beetle's successful delivering of a calf she also manages to deliver a baby to a poor woman that the official midwife left.  Interestingly, this doesn't mean that Beetle is suddenly endowed with perfect midwifing abilities.  Failing to deliver another child, she must rely on her mentor once again, crushing her burgeoning ego.  The moral, that nothing is easy and that you must work at what you want, is a good one.<br />There were some slightly odd moments in the book.  The midwife is described as being an envious/jealous type who cannot abide the notion of having a rival.  Yet she is overheard later in the book, almost praising the girl's abilities.  Still, this is a small quibble.  I enjoyed reading about the girl's progress.  It would be wonderfully paired with \\"Crispin: The Cross of Lead\\".  Both stories follow ignorant orphans who learn a new profession and end their stories by going into the respective honest professions they desire.  The time periods are not far off either.  This book may or may not read aloud well.  I don't know.  There are some touchy moments (the near rape of Beetle by drunken boys, the midwife's affair with the baker, the well described births) that might make the squeamish (or their parents) uncomfortable.  Nonetheless, I found this an important book and one worth remembering.	2004-02-22

In \\"Lives of the Musicians\\", however, eccentrics with talent not only were discovered, but lauded long past their own lifetimes.  Author Kathleen Krull has partnered with illustrator Kathryn Hewitt to create the world's first interesting children's collection of biographical information concerning some of the best composers ever to breathe.<br />The book spans the field of music from Verdi to Woody Guthrie.  Each entry (there are sixteen in total) contains one picture and one description of the artist's life.  These descriptions, as described by the author herself, \\"are offered now as a way of getting closer to the musicians - and the music\\".  Every quirk and interesting tidbit is laid before the reader in the most wonderfully entrancing ways.  Did you know that Bach once got into a knife fight in the streets?  Or that Sir William Gilbert owned a bee named Buzfuz?  It might be interesting to collect such fun but otherwise meaningless tidbits about composers' sometimes sordid lives, but Krull goes a step further.  Facts included in each life explore the necessary details of their birth and death dates, how they were introduced to music, their lives, etc.  Each section is also followed by information about their best-known works.  What I liked about this book, however, was that the author did not choose to linger over their individual creations.  A kid reading this book is not going to want to hear a long drawn out account of exactly why Chopin chose to write his Funeral March the way he did.  You can find this information in a standard biography of Chopin's works.  No, this is a book gives children the chance to acknowledge that all those hoity-toity names they've been forced to digest in elementary school music classes actually had interesting and sometimes wacky lives.  Plus, the author is kind enough to include a section of musical terms, an index of composers, and a list meant, \\"For Further Reading ... And Listening\\", for those kids who wish to know more about these fascinating heroes of music.<br />Krull's method of writing is particularly adept when conveying irony.  In her section devoted to Erik Satie (a perfect choice for this book, if ever there was one) she describes the composer's reaction to his own poverty.<br />\\"He once remarked, `It's odd. You find people in every bar willing to offer you a drink.  No one ever dreams of presenting you with a sandwich'\\".<br />The next line then states off-handedly, \\"He died of cirrhosis of the liver at age fifty-nine\\".  Kids may not get the joke, but I for one whole-heartedly approve of the author's choice to mention that fact after such a statement.<br />Because the book only contains sixteen composers, you can't help but wonder what the author's method of selection was.  These composers certainly define the canon of Western music, with two women, an African-American, and a man of Jewish decent serving to bring a little diversity to the list.  But why include Charles Ives and not Claude Debussy?  Why Stravinsky and not Wagner?  The only reasons I can find for some choices would be because some composers lived far more interesting lives than others.  Certainly the range of oddities Krull has collected is fascinating.<br />This book is probably best for slightly older children.  Krull is an honest biographer and does not skirt around the fact that Chopin and George Sand never married, or that Tchaikovsky was undoubtedly a homosexual.  She does not fudge facts to make them more interesting or record hearsay and rumor (though she is prone to mentioning \\"legends\\", like that concerning Beethoven's death).  All in all, you will not find a better or more entrancing way of introducing kids to the classical composers.  And for those of you that wouldn't be able to tell Prokofiev from Stravinsky if you bumped into him in the street, let me recommend that you take a gander at this puppy as well.  It's a heckof a lot of fun, and a hoot to boot.It's a heck of a lot of fun, and a hoot to boot.	2004-02-22

I imagine that author Chris Van Allsburg must be tickled pink by way his book, \\"The Polar Express\\" has slowly gained increasing attention and praise as the years have gone by.  Though not my favorite Van Allsburg (a tip of the hat grants his miraculous \\"The Stranger\\" that honor) this book is perhaps more perfectly his style than any of his other texts.  And in that way, it is truly wondrous.<br />In this story, a young boy travels at night by a train bearing the book's title to the North Pole with a host of other antsy children.  This combines the dual pleasure kids would feel in getting to staying up late AND taking a train all by themselves.  Once at the North Pole, our hero asks Santa only for a silver bell from his reindeer's sleigh.  Santa complies and though the boy looses the bell on his way home, Santa returns it to him.  For years afterwards, only those who truly believe can hear the bell's magical ring (which, actually, explains why adults cannot hear Santa fly overhead at night, I suppose).<br />It's a lovely story, complimented nicely with Van Allsburg's realistic (but not photo-realistic) illustrations.  Particularly nice is how the story does not date.  Though it clearly takes place at a time when children wore dressing gowns, it does not feel as if it is a period piece.  The kids traveling on the train are slightly multi-cultural and the waiters on the train delightful in their white puffy hats.<br />This book is so well loved that it has actually inspired whole communities to create their own makeshift Polar Expresses.  On these trains, kids are served hot cocoa \\"as thick and rich as melted chocolate bars\\" while grown-ups read them the book.  They then meet Santa and go home contented and happy.  Unfortunately, as charming as this may seem, it may be greatly exploited with the late 2004 release of the CGI film version of the book.  My advice is to grab this book right now, regardless of whether it's Christmas or not, and read it to your kids thoroughly.  Such nice stories as this deserve extensive attention.  Let us all hope that this story sinks deeply into the canon of picture books beloved by millions of kids the wide world over.

If you've a soft place in your heart for those buzzing swarming little blood-sucking fiends, you probably shouldn't peruse this particular book.  HOWEVER.  If you happen to enjoy a good \\"why\\" story from Africa, you could hardly do better than the lushly illustrated \\"Why Mosquitoes Buzz in People's Ears\\".<br /><br />In a kind of Chicken Little series of events, a lying mosquito sets off a chain reaction ending, ultimately, in the sun no longer rising.  When the animals of the forest slowly track down the reasons behind the sun's disappearance, they eventually reach the conclusion that mosquito is the one to blame.  Ever since, mosquitoes will sometimes ask people whether or not \\"everyone\\" is still angry at them.  The answer is a satisfying (I love this descriptive sound) KPAO!<br /><br />The illustrations are splendid.  During the day they are set against a white background.  By the time the sun disappears, they pop out of a black setting.  Kids will like finding the small smiling pink bird that cleverly pops up in every scene.  It's a fine fine text that bears more than a passing resemblance at times to the classic nursery rhyme \\"The House the Jack Built\\".  And who knew that the sound lions make when they laugh is \\"Nge nge nge\\"?  Not I, said the fly.  A lovely read.	2004-02-22

Were it not for them, Babar might not have ever been created and we would have to live in a wretched Babar-less world.  As it is, however, we are blessed to have this delightful story at our fingertips at any time.  The story of Babar was originally published in 1933, and it has stood the test of time with dignity and flair.<br />The story of Babar is simple.  After his mother is shot by a cruel hunter, the little elephant runs away to a metropolitan city.  Once there, he is taken under the wing of a kindly older lady.  Babar then proceeds to become the greatest dandy of children's literature today.  Here is the section I love the most:<br /> \\"Babar then buys himself: A shirt with a collar and tie, a suit of a becoming shade of green, then a handsome derby hat, and also shoes with spats\\".<br />Contrary to popular thought, an elephant in spats is the most dignified thing in the world.  With these purchases Babar has transformed himself from rural rube to the original metrosexual.  He becomes cultured, learning the rudimentary aspects of human civilization while regaling party guests with his tales of the forest (note his pin-striped pants and casual dinner jacket).  Eventually Babar is lured back to his jungle home and is swiftly crowned King of the elephants.<br />The 1933 setting in which Babar acclimatizes himself has grown more charming over the years.  And most remarkably?  Most older picture books contain at least one racial stereotype somewhere in the midst of a picture.  Not so our darling \\"Babar\\".  I feel safe in saying that you might search through any future adventure of the winsome elephant and not stumble across a single picture or piece of writing that causes you a twenty-first century gasp of disgust.  This isn't to say that there aren't some rather peculiar dated aspects to the book.  I read this book as a child and had a vivid visceral memory return to me when I saw the sickly state of the former King of the elephants who passed away after eating a bad mushroom.  That is a grotesquerie unknown to the kiddies today.  But all in all, \\"Babar\\" is without fault.  Certainly he's the essence of capitalism.  One might believe the elephants crown him king as much for his pretty red convertible as for his brains.  But Babar is still a unique and moving tale that will continue to entertain the masses of children for years and years to come.of the elephants who passed away after eating a bad mushroom.

Caldecott Award winner \\"They Were Strong and Good\\" has some remarkable qualities as well as some lamentable ones.  Created by the clever man who brought the world's attention to sweet \\"Ferdinand\\" the bull, Robert Lawson chooses here to tell the stories of his parents and grandparents.  As he himself points out in the beginning, none of them were great or famous but, \\"They all helped to make the United States the great nation that it now is\\".  Each grandparent hailed from a different country and each settled in the United States.  Some lived in the North and some fought for the South during the Civil War.  In the end, however, they were not remarkable people.  But they were strong and good.<br /><br />So be it.  I like this idea.  And I like the author's illustrations (for the most part).  Lawson's mastery of the pen and ink method is superb in this story.  An exceptional example is his illustration of the City of Paterson.  Using a \\"then\\" and \\"now\\" motif, he displays Paterson first in all its grimy Industrial Revolution glory and then in its previous pastoral perfection.  Lawson is also adept at the visual gag.  Once the author's Scottish sea captain of a grandfather and his Dutch grandmother wed, the next picture (rather than a frolicsome wedding shot) shows a woman heaved over the side of the boat.  Says the text, \\"My mother's mother liked the monkeys and the sugar cane and the parrots, but she did not like sailing on the sea\\".  Understatement at its finest.<br /><br />Which brings me to the parts of the book I don't like.  I really wish I could've loved this book wholly and without reservation.  Remember - this book was published in 1940.  I was willing to forgive the shot of a happy black boy in the Caribbean.  There may have been some.  I was willing to forgive the Native Americans that the author's mother did not like.  The book doesn't caricature them too badly and the worst they do is ask for food.  And anyway, she hated white lumberjacks too.  But then you start getting into the portrayals of African-Americans and the book loses me.  If the book had just contained that picture of a mammy-like servant threatening the Native Americans, I still wouldn't have objected too heartily.  She's actually not a bad caricature.  Though wearing the standard head scarf she isn't smiling with the big lips so horrid in some books.  It's the moment when the narrative switches from the Northerners' lives to the Southerners'.  The author's father owned a slave and two dogs.  Then war broke out and we suddenly have a shot of the whole family, slaves and all, weeping as father goes off to war.  A different mammy-like woman sobs on a porch.  The black slave boy sobs as well.  Just out of curiosity, folks, why exactly are the slaves upset?  Finally, to add insult to injury, we see another black slave riding into town to warn the citizens that the Yankees are coming.  To be honest, this is a bit puzzling.  Shouldn't the slave be riding TOWARDS the Yankees?  Or is that just revisionist history?<br /><br />In any case, these little touches all combine to make me less than absolutely in love with this story.  Though the premise is an excellent one, the racial tone makes it a difficult read today.  Not a poor read, necessarily.  But a read that will require a lot of explanation to those four year-olds that can't understand why the Indians went around demanding food all the time.And anyway, she hated white lumberjacks too.

Neither is subtlety (though you probably wouldn't know it when a 2-year old has decided to tell you \\"the funniest knock knock joke ever\\").  The creation of an effective picture book for small children has a variety of different tacks it can take, subtle being the most difficult.  But \\"Click, Clack, Moo\\", is beyond sublime, and it gets away with it too.  In it, author Doreen Cronin and illustrator Betsy Lewin have penned a delightful story about some dexterous cows with simple demands.  In this tale, Farmer Brown's cows have gotten ahold of a typewriter.  Now equipped with the means with which they can express themselves, the cows demand electric blankets forthwith.  Farmer Brown demurs (by throwing a small fit) so the cows join up with the chickens in demanding blankets for the chickens as well.  In the end, a solution is reached and all parties are satisfied with the outcome.<br />There is a single moment in this book that was, to me, the height of sophistication.  After hearing the cows demands, Farmer Brown types up a letter of refusal.  We next see a two-page spread of the long road to the barn.  A white duck, oversized letter in beak and a left foot poised in the air, walks alone.  The text reads, \\"Duck was a neutral party, so he brought the ultimatum to the cows\\".  I love using the term neutral party in a picture book.  I love that extravagant and elaborate word \\"ultimatum\\" bandied about a barnyard tale.  Every children's book should be so lucky as to have a moment such as this.<br />Honestly, though I enjoyed the pictures I was not overwhelmed by them.  Betsy Levin's style is a simple watercolor utilizing thick black lines and wide open-eyed expressions.  That's all well and good, but in some ways I wanted to see something a little more interesting.  But that's just me.  This book is a fun romp into \\"what if\\" territory.  Read aloud well, it could capture many a youngsters attention again and again and again.	2004-02-16

Accompanied by the excellent illustrator Diane Goode, the book is a straightforward look at life amongst the best-known American mountain folk.  Scenes of daily life include everything from needing a brave adult to accompany you out into the dark scary night (on your way to the outhouse) to getting baptized in the local swimming hole.<br />The book is remarkable for its lack of overt sentimentality.  Some might disagree with me, but I was struck by how this book did not fail to note the less than desirable elements of living in the wilderness.  Swimming in a swimming hole of your own might be fun.  Just watch out for snakes.  And baths required an awful amount of work.  Pumping the water.  Carrying it to the house.  Heating it.  Goode's delicate illustrations accompany the text of this story perfectly.  If Rylant says that the proprietors of the local store (Mr. & Mrs. Crawford) were identical, then gosh darn it, the people look identical.  And I especially adored the moment when the narrator's grandmother kills a big nasty snake in the woods.  The next picture displays the narrator, her brother, and two other red-headed childred posing sheepishly for a traveling photographer, gigantic dead snake draped across their heads.<br />I cannot think of many other book that take place in Appalachia.  And I certainly can't think of any that are better than this.  A sweet good-hearted story, \\"When I Was Young In the Mountains\\" understands what it meant to live a difficult life with pleasure and human warmth.	2004-02-16

Every country in the world will have it translated.  And every human being will know it.  Too high praise for a book that so few people (let alone librarians and booksellers) have heard of?  Not at all.  The amount of reception a book receives is not always indicative of how good it is.  And this book is good.  Boy oh boy, is it good.<br />Taking the perspective of a ten-year-old boy during the first year of World War One, Iain Lawrence draws on his own knowledge (and intense research as well) to bring us a story of children during wartime.  Johnny's father is a toy maker, and before going to fight the front lines he gives Johnny a set of handsome Nutcracker men to play with.  As the war continues, Johnny's father sends his son hand-carved soldier to fight the German Nutcrackers.  But Johnny comes to believe these soldiers carry a power beyond his own private games.  As he plays with his toys he hears of battles frighteningly similar to the ones he's created.  Soon Johnny comes to believe that the actions he takes in playing influence the real battles in France.<br />This book is about war.  The dirt, fatigue, and mindlessness of it.  Drawing on the Iliad, Lawrence draws definitive connections between Troy and World War One that are eerily credible.  As Johnny moves from loving the excitement of war (as a child does) to hating it (as an adult would) his opinion of fate, the gods, and God himself waver between fear and love.  Beautifully written passages display his father's disillusionment as he deals with constant shelling, death, and despair.  Though he never comes out and says it, the audience understands that this war really did mark the end of chivalry.  Certainly we remember some dashing figures from this time.  The Red Baron.  Lawrence of Arabia.  But for most soldiers it was a dirty filthy war.  Based on dirt alone I highly recommend pairing this book with Karen Hesse's \\"Out of the Dust\\".  You'll never want to leave your shower again.<br />After the story, Lawrence clears up many of the facts portrayed within the story, elevating it from interesting fiction to a novella based in reality.  Yes, there really was a Christmas Truce of 1914 where Germans and Brits climbed out of their trenches into the No Man's Land to celebrate Christmas together.  Yes the village of Cliffe had their railway bombed by the Germans.  Lawrence also notes that the supernatural was invoked more than a few times during the long years of the war.  This feeling is well replicated in his book.  The story wavers between what is real and what is imagined brilliantly.  It never changes its tone (which is to say, it never starts out as a historical drama and suddenly turns sci-fi) and there are moments of otherworldliness that are nothing if not poignant.<br />It is a gory story.  It has moments of horror and despair.  But it is also an honest story.  This tells a tale of a country in which war was seen as a glorious outing, only to turn into more death than anyone could have ever imagined.  Sound familiar?  When governments can make war seem wonderful, people will buy into the myth.  It takes books like, \\"Lord of the Nutcracker Men\\" to remind us of what's really important in life.<br />\\"We're getting better at fighting wars.

In it, Stanley Yelnats (note that his name is spelled the same, backwards and forwards) is sent to Camp Green Lake for a crime he did not commit.  At a detention camp in the middle of a desert, Stanley must dig a hole as long, wide, and deep as his shovel every day.  Along with his compatriots he seems to be searching for something.  But what?<br />The book follows Stanley, a fat white boy, and the variety of different kinds of people he finds himself encamped with.  After reading this book, my husband commented that it is a small encapsulation of white America's current state of slavery and the apologies we should make.  At first I couldn't see it.  Now I can.  In the climax of this story Stanley carries Zero, an African American youth abandoned by his mother, up a mountain fulfilling a curse placed on the Yelnats from generation to generation.  The camp itself is simply a slave state for kids that no one wants or cares about.  Themes of illiteracy and assumptions about what people can and can not learn are brought up.<br />The book is deceptively simple.  It reads particularly well for young readers but contains themes and thoughts larger than I thought you could place in a book so small.  It will not date. It will only grow more interesting over time.	2004-02-16

Jean Fritz is author of many an exciting children's biography.  If you've read \\"Why Don't You Get a Horse, Sam Adams?\\" or \\"Can't You Make Them Behave, King George?\\" then you know her works already.  Turning her talents towards a slightly more recent history, Fritz takes a good long look at her own life.  Having grown up in China in the early 1920s, this is a story of a child trying to discover where she fits in.<br />First of all, you have to admire Fritz's candor.  The very first thing she does is state in the Forward that she considers this a fiction.  Though the facts are true here and there, the author has taken some liberties with time and memory.  She obviously cannot remember everything that happened perfectly, so she has filled in the gaps as best as possible.  Though, she points out, \\"it does not feel like fiction to me. It is my story, told as truly as I can tell it\\".  THANK YOU, Jean Fritz.  How many books do we read where the author claims that everything within the book is the whole truth and nothing but the truth, while taking wild leaps in narrative and interpretation?  Finally, we have an author that admits that much of this book may be considered fiction, though she herself remembers it as fact.  Such honesty is admirable, and exceedingly rare in non-fiction writers.<br />As for the story itself, Fritz is very good at what she does.  The writing here is superb.  Living in a very sketchy time in China's history, little Jean was in the unfortunate position of living in a country where foreigners were finally not being tolerated with much kindness any longer.  Often times Chinese peasants rail against Jean for being the kind of \\"foreign devil\\" that is a bane to their country.  Fritz never condemns these people, and even makes note at the back of this book the reasons behind their dislike and distrust.  China was a country that was continually being divided into smaller and smaller pieces by the invading colonists.  Neither does the character of Jean ever forget that the servants who work for her are human beings as well.  Her parents often do fall into the master-servant manner of thinking, a fact that Jean objects to.  They do not learn much about the world in which they live.  They instead attempt to recreate their own American lives in a foreign land.  But Jean knows that there are aspects of Chinese life that she vastly prefers to the life of her parents.  The fact that she recognizes this is impressive.  The fact that she can relay it years after the fact in this book, is astounding.<br />If I have any objections to this book at all they are directed not at the author, but at the illustrator.  Margot Tomes has her points.  She is not necessarily a bad illustrator.  But in this particular book her pictures are superfluous and unnecessary.  Sometimes they even touch upon the offensive without really going there.  While Fritz never condemns the native Chinese for their opinions, Tomes draws them looking sneaky or sordid at inappropriate times.  One such example is in a scene where Jean's servants feed her cat outside, not knowing she's around.  The scene in the book is rather touching.  Until this time, Jean was half afraid her cook was trying to poison the family.  Knowing him to be a person capable of caring for her cat (as he says, \\"A cat is a cat.  There are no foreign cats, no Chinese cats, no capitalist cats, no Communist cats.  Just cats\\") she no longer fears his food.  Yet the picture accompanying this text shows a shifty eyed servant peering suspiciously over his shoulder as the cats eats.  Unnecessary.  Somewhat offensive.<br />Fritz ends this book with a series of photographs displaying her family, friends, and where she lived in China.  Combined with the book, these serve as an excellent document about a time little recorded in either adult or children's fiction.  Using a unique perspective culled from her own life, Jean Fritz has written one of the most interesting booksabout the Chinese/American experience existing today.  It is an honorable and impressive piece of work.about the Chinese/American experience existing today.  It is an honorable and impressive piece of work.	2004-02-16

However, this is more a moral for parents than children.<br />Just the same, kids will like Owen and those with their own comfort blankets will perhaps be inspired by his mother's ingenious solution to their woes.  In any case, any book that teaches children to love handkerchiefs (Fuzzy's eventual fate) has got to be doing SOMETHING right.	2004-02-15

One of my favorite plots involved a story in which all the grown-ups on my street disappeared and the kids had to fend for themselves.  O.T. Nelson has gone a bit further with \\"The Girl Who Owned a City\\".  In this book, all humans over the age of thirteen have been wiped out by a deadly plague.  It is up to Lisa, the book's protagonist, to found a new community where the children can live and work in peace without worrying about roving violent gangs.  This is a story that could have been written by me at ten.  Unfortunately, the writing itself seems as if it WAS written by a ten-year-old.<br />Don't get me wrong.  The idea of this book is a lot of fun.  What kid wouldn't want to own their own city?  To rule over a lot of other children?  To be their inspired leader?  So two thumbs up on the idea for the plot.  Two thumbs down for the actual book.<br />The real problem with this story is the poor poor writing.  Nelson fills this text with a myriad of different kinds of inconsistencies and B-movie dialogue.  For example, the book opens with this line, \\"At this time last Tuesday, she (Lisa) had been sitting, patiently, in fifth-grade social studies\\".  So the plague officially finished a week ago.  Fast forward seventy-five pages in a section that happens roughly four or five days later.  \\" `What will happen to us?' she wondered for the hundredth time since October\\".  This happens around Christmas day.  So apparently last Tuesday was roughly two months ago.  Other problems persist.  This plague happened so quickly that farmers were unable to free their livestock.  Yet not a single human body is ever found, or even eluded to.  And why do none of the characters in this book (save one, briefly) ever miss their parents?  I suppose Nelson reasoned that you can't have a fun post-apocalyptic story bogged down by actual emotions.  But couldn't the author have at least tried?<br />Compound little logical problems like this with the actual plot's problems, and you begin to see what I'm talking about.  There is no electricity in this world, nor plumbing either.  When Lisa decides to make a fortress out of the abandoned high school she thinks of everything.  Like a castle, none of the children will need to leave it.  Unlike a castle, its plumbing isn't working.  How are these 300 some kids showering and using the toilets?  Also, why are these kids the only ones who ever thought to seek out food in warehouses and to drive cars?  Wouldn't driving cars be the first things kids would do if their parents disappeared forever?<br />Finally, there is the big big problem of the moral of the story.  Lisa refers continually to her fortress as MY city.  The city that SHE owns.  Various kids point out that this isn't the smartest thing to go around doing.  After all, she hardly did all the work making it safe herself.  Yet the book firmly stands by her statements.  Lisa has an eminently interesting speech when one of her captains attempts to convince her that voting is a good thing.<br />\\"Do you think it would be fair for the group to decide that all the supplies I found were suddenly community property, and that I don't have the right to decide how they should be used?  What would stop them from deciding to vote away my right to the cars I find, now that I've taught children how to drive?\\"<br />So there you are folks.  If you have a charismatic leader who claims all authority and doesn't allow free elections.... well that's just swell.  People can't be allowed to have a say in their own governance.  They just mess stuff up.  I'd love to do a fast forward on this story, twenty years into the future when the protagonist is battling for continual unquestioned power from her people.  The blurb on the back of this book (in paperback form) compares this story to \\"Lord of the Flies\\".  Not an entirely correct statement (\\"Lord of the Flies\\" is, what we call, GOOD writing) but given enough time I've little doubt that the characters in this story will reach that sticky end soon enough.  Fortunately, I didn't have to spend any more time with this book than I already had.e doubt that the characters in this story will reach that sticky end soon enough.

A person can't go around giving EVERY good picture book five stars just because it's enjoyable.  When I review a book for younger children I like to point out its unique qualities.  It's artistic originality.  It's simple but brilliant storytelling.  And then you read something like \\"The Maggie B.\\" and it all goes flying out the window.  \\"The Maggie B.\\" is not particularly original.  Its art, while charming, will not bowl you over with its fantastical use of line and color.  It's story is told well, but simple.  And yet I would be a hard-hearted grinch if I gave this book anything less than the five stars it so richly deserves.<br /><br />The plot of this story is summed up by the Library of Congress like so:  \\"A little girl's wish to sail for a day on a boat named for her `with someone nice for company' comes true\\".  Maggie's little brother is that \\"someone nice\\" and the two of them spend the day on their little boat living the sea life.  The boat is fully equipped with an apple, peach and orange tree bearing fruit (and a beautiful toucan).  There is an abundance of fresh eggs and milk to be had from various chickens and the goat.  Maggie herself fishes and serves up sumptuous meals of lobster and peaches with cinnamon and honey for dessert.  The day is simple and homey, the only real source of concern a thunderstorm that crashes and booms towards the end of the day.  Even then, Maggie thoughtfully battens down the hatches and plays her fiddle to her brother, tucked snugly in his bed.<br /><br />There are only a few books that convey \\"comfort\\" well.  Tasha Tudor's books do to some degree, as does the occasional Steven Kellogg.  But this book tops them all.  Author/illustrator Irene Haas has developed a small lovely little tale of two children on the nicest ship in the world.  Any little boy or girl who has played house with a younger sibling will gravitate fully to this enchanting little tale.  It will not shock you.  It will not excite you.  But it will wrap you up in a big warm towel just as Maggie does her little brother after taking a splashy bath in the sink.  You will not want to leave the ship again..

In the long and varied history of Ms. Mother Goose, so many collections and books of nursery rhymes have been made that it's a wonder anyone keeps track anymore.  Certainly I was a child when this particular treasury originally came out and until my current grown state I'd never even heard of it.  Illustrated by Arnold Lobel (the nice man who introduced the world to \\"Frog and Toad\\") this book is nothing if not extensive.  It runs the gamut of rhymes, from classics like \\"Three Blind Mice\\" to limericks to tongue-twisters.  It is a breathtaking achievement.<br />Many a nursery rhyme book, if extensive, will place two or three rhymes on a page and choose to illustrate only one.  Not so Mr. Lobel.  It is with great manual dexterity that he has found ways to merge, combine and bring together like-rhymes so as to combine their illustrations into a single motif.  Consider his page containing romantic poems.  Under around and through a single arbor dwell characters that act out such poems as \\"Something old, something new\\", \\"I love coffee\\", \\"Roses are red\\", and \\"If you love me, love me true\\".  Poems about the weather, food, and royalty are similarly grouped.  Longer poems, such as the classic \\"Partridge in a pear tree\\" are given full page multi-spreads.  Lobel is nothing if not meticulous in his craft.<br />I did have an occasional objection.  Though the book is expertly indexed, there is not so much as an author's note or preface explaining where he got these poems.  The title page merely reads, \\"Selected and illustrated by Arnold Lobel\\", with scant attention to exactly WHERE he got them.  This isn't idle curiosity either.  More than one of these poems contains wordings different from those known to the pubic at large.  For example, instead of the poem \\"London Bridge is falling down\\" we read that \\"London Bridge is broken down\\".  Or smaller changes, such as making a ha' penny a half penny in \\"Christmas is coming\\".<br />Diligent parents beware.  This book abounds with capital punishment and death.  Much like the early fairy tales, nursery rhymes weren't always for the kiddie set.  Adults liked them just as much.  In the edition I happened to borrow from the library, some extraordinarily concerned parents took offense to a couple phrases in \\"This is the house that Jack built\\" (changing \\"That killed the rat\\" to \\"That bumped the rat\\" and \\"That waked the priest all shaved and shorn\\" to \\"That waked the minister all shaved and shorn\\").  Oog.<br />In the end, this is really a fabulous collection.  The illustrations are adept (containing some very funny interpretations as well) and the rhymes not only familiar but enjoyable.

Having immigrated to American with her parents from Korea at age four, Young Ju finds acclimation to their new life to be filled with personal difficulties and private accomplishments.<br />Many stories about immigrants coming to America pay the full brunt of their attention to how that child does at school.  More than one book is ALL about children trying to fit in with others and wondering why they are so different.  \\"Molly's Pilgrim\\" type stuff.  This book's focus, however, rests squarely on the story of Young Ju's home life and the difficulties she has dealing with her parents.  It is a clear-eyed look at how people come to terms with difficult circumstances.  For Young Ju's mother, life means working two jobs while maintaining a home and dealing with a difficult husband.  For Young Ju's father, life is filled with disappointments.  As his life seemingly disintegrates before his eyes, he takes out all his frustrations and anger on his cowering family.  His pride is a source of continual pain.<br />I marvel that this book was recognized for its beauty.  An Na does not flinch from the harsh details of Young Ju's family life.  Physical violence at the hands of her father is never treated lightly or accepted as a way of life.  Nor does the text demonize this man who has brought his family so much misery.  There are moments (moment Young Ju herself describes as, \\"not always, hardly even any\\") where Young Ju's father is shown as affectionate and caring.  A fun kind of dad that his children adore.  This same man, however, will kick his unsuspecting son in the stomach in the hopes of making him a man.  The book does not condemn Apa (father) with anything but his own actions.  By the story's end, Young Ju has found an inner strength that allows her to acknowledge the right thing to do, all the while seeing her mother for the amazing person that she is.<br />Finally, the book is so well written that it really does take your breath away.  Na is just as comfortable creating the thoughts and actions of a four year-old as she is a fifteen year-old.  You are in safe hands with this author.  Beautifully written.  Simple.  Perfect.so well written that it really does take your breath away.  Na is just as comfortable creating the thoughts and actions of a four year-old as she is a fifteen year-old.

That's what I thought to myself as I picked up this sly little piece of black and white elegance.  When I was a child I remember seeing this book in some form or context.  Literal minded child that I was, I was always a little perturbed by the content.  In this book, deceptively simple black and white photographs tell the story of a car trip to the city and then back home to the suburbs again.  To read this book, the teller reads it first one way to the city, then turns the entire book upside down to tell the story going back to home again.<br />To accomplish this trick, author/illustrator Ann Jonas utilizes her skills as a graphic designer to create pictures that use negative space adroitly.  This book is like a series of industrial M.C. Escher prints.  Jonas's book resembles her husband Donald Crews similar storyline in \\"Freight Train\\".  In both books, the focus is on moving through a landscape.  You never see people in either story.  But while the focus of \\"Freight Train\\" is to concentrate on the speed of a single object, this book looks squarely at the scenery.  Any child that has ever been forced to spend hours in the back of a car on the highway will recognize the sights seen along the road.  Sheep, lakes, and forest trails abound.  Though Jonas's technical wizardry almost steals the show, there is a lot to be said for the beauty of the images themselves.<br />Kids who have read this book more than once may find themselves having some difficulty seeing a single picture one way and not another.  I myself had to strain to make an image of smoky factories not appear to be a farmhouse upside down.  I don't see this as a book that children will necessarily scream for at night.  At the same time, it is just the kind of book that a child 20 years down the road might pick up in a local library, flip through absently, and say to themselves, \\"I remember this book!\\".	2004-02-15

The final chapter in the \\"His Dark Materials\\" chronicles and it's a doozy.  Leave it to Philip Pullman to come up with the slam bang finale to end all slam bang finales.  In this last look at his beloved protagonists Lyra and Will (until he publishes their new adventures, that is), the forces of earth, heaven, and a myriad of different worlds have aligned for a final battle for the destiny of humankind and the fate of life/death itself.  Booga booga.<br />There is some debate as to whether or not this is the weakest book of the saga.  The book is filled with vast and complex ideas and new and interesting creatures, but there are a couple questions left unanswered at the end.  Why was Dr. Malone the serpent?  How exactly did Will and Lyra change the movement of Dust?  Admittedly, these questions may be answered in the future.  Pullman isn't done with this world yet.  Some might say he's only just started, and this book is expertly woven.  With additional characters and plotlines mixed and mingled into a big furry series of battles, he doesn't leave the reader feeling unsatisfied.  Just a little sad.  And after all, isn't that how most good books should end?	2004-02-15

It's difficult for me to look at this book today and not be swept over completely by nostalgia and longing.  I especially remember the yearning I would feel after reading this book, when little.  In this simple story, a little girl asks her grandma what life was like when her mother was a little girl.  The grandmother relates the special activities that would occur seasonally, illustrating the children's life during that time.  Each month is accompanied by an appropriate quote that sums up the feelings of that time.  One month might have a quote from Mother Goose.  Another from Geoffrey Chaucer.  Children reading this quotes won't know who they are, but they'll enjoy reading such phrases as, \\"When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock\\" (James Whitcomb Riley), feeling the emotion behind each quotation.<br />But it's the storyline that gripped me so tightly as a kid.  I wanted to belong to the world Tudor conjured up.  An odd period of history that's not quite the pioneer days, but definitely not modern day.  Here, people have beetle races and make their own cider.  They have sugarhouses and eat maple syrup on the snow (something I always wanted to do).  Birthdays are celebrated in mysterious woodland grottos and birthday cakes are sent floating down rivers at night, lit for everyone to see.  And of course there are corgis and cats everywhere.<br />Tudor's illustrations go beyond her scenes.  Each picture is contained within beautifully embellished vines that mimic the time of year.  Sometimes you'll see red tipped blackbirds flying in the gutters between the pages.  Or pussywillows winding about the corners.  Then too, the people in these pictures are always having fun.  The kids perform their own Midsummer's Eve plays or have exciting Halloween parties.  Even those moments when someone is being scared at Halloween, you can usually see some child somewhere acting brave or fully enjoying his moment of surprise.<br />The only slightly objectionable moment in the book in this book may be a moment of charades in which two boys are dressed like \\"Indians\\" preparing to scalp their sister.  It's fairly tame when you look at it, and I've seen far more offensive stuff presented in older kids books since then.  Beyond that, there is not a single moment of discomfort to be felt.  This is a beautiful book that has retained its loveliness as the years go by.  Such sweet stories as this do not come along every day.  You'd do well to keep this one in mind.ise.  <br />The only slightly objectionable moment in the book in this book may be a moment of charades in which two boys are dressed like \\"Indians\\" preparing to scalp their sister.

Having been sent to obedience school for what he deems minor infractions, Ike LaRue finds himself writing pitiful letters to his owner afar.  Kids reading this book will have to distinguish between the overdramatic things Ike says and the colorful pictures that display how life really is.  As they read the book, children will see that while Ike may state some over-exaggerations, he truly does feel affection for his owner, Mrs. LaRue.<br />Author Mark Teague is hardly unknown to the world of children's illustrations.  The ever-popular \\"How do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight?\\" featured his own unique illustrating methods.  But he is just as able an author.  \\"Dear Mrs. LaRue\\", is an adept melding of text and artistry.  In each scene the viewer sees the truth in color, and Ike's fabulous imaginations in bleak black and white.  Interestingly enough, it is difficult to say exactly how much Ike says is fanciful.  For example, Ike's insistence that he has saved his owner numerable times from speeding vehicles turns out to be more than true at the end of the story.  Also, a final shot of the cats Ike has hounded suggests that they may not be the angelic creatures so believed of their owners.<br />The book is an excellent one for children, containing more than a few visual jokes for adults.  Parents can choose whether or not to explain what Ike's diagnosis of \\"hypochondria\\" really means or why they laughed when one of the final pictures displayed a jubilant display of people carrying \\"I like Ike\\" signs.<br />Mark Teague notes on the book flap that when his own dog wanted attention it would feign a limp, \\"But if he was distracted by something - a squirrel or an interesting smell - he was likely to forget which paw was supposedly hurt and give himself away\\".  With such an inspiration, this book wasn't necessarily bound to be good.  It just happened to work out nicely that way.t nicely that way.	2004-02-15

Ed Young is nothing so much as an artistic version of Eric Carle.  Not that I have anything against Eric Carle (author of \\"The Hungry Caterpillar\\") but in \\"Seven Blind Mice\\", the artist has imbued his book with such amazing colors and textures that it's a wondrous delight to look through.  The story is the classic folktale of the seven blind men and the elephant, rendered mousey.  In this story, seven blind mice (not the usual tailless three) come across a large elephant.  Each mouse feels a different part of the elephant and comes up with a different idea of what the large object blocking their path is.  The moral of the story is summed up nicely at the end as, \\"Knowing in part may make a fine tale, but wisdom comes from seeing the whole\\".<br />Each scene displays the colorful mice (each a different vibrant color) against a black background.  These cut-outs are positioned perfectly in each scene to convey movement, mindset, and personality.  Though they may be similar shapes, they are by no means identical.  But I really can't convey the beauty Young has created here.  The elaborate papers used for the elephant's skin or the evocative mind's eye scenes of what the elephant might be.  Each time a colored mouse describes what the elephant is (whether pillar or spear or cliff) that object appears on the opposite page in brilliant beautiful papers the color of the mouse describing it.<br />Pretty doesn't describe it.  Beautiful comes close.  But spectacular is the most accurate statement that can be made about this book.  Now go buy it.	2004-02-15

In this story, a lovely young girl marries a prince trapped, during the day, in the body of a lion.  When an enchantment forces him to fly away from his beloved in the body of a dove, she sets out to find her lover once more.<br />Initially, I was going to begin this review with a small rant.  Despite the fact that the characters in this book wear clothing, and live in palaces, of Indian or Eastern design, the people themselves are white white white.  Why?  Couldn't we have Grimm-like tale containing something other than the standard Caucasian skin tone?  So there we go.  That's my only complaint.<br />Onwards to my point.  The illustrations in this book are a step above breathtaking.  The pictures drawn by Laurel Long are so beautiful that every tiny centimeter is filled with the most delicate linework and livid colors imaginable.  From the folds of the young lady's dresses to the iridescent clouds surrounding the moon at night this book is fabulously beautiful.  The story itself isn't anything you haven't heard before.

If human eyes had the ability to see the diseases that flies spread, then this book is a fairly good indication of what the world would look like. This is, in essence, an alphabet book. On each and every page the naughty little fly (looking more like a Searle creation than anything else) bother and annoys every woman, child, and beast that crosses its path. This is not your sweet little baby alphabet book. No, this is an alphabet book of their nightmares. And it's pretty darn good.<br />Stephen Gammell's illustrations look as if one hundred and fifty flies sneezed a rainbow of colors onto the pages. Kind of a colorized &quot;Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark&quot; for the toddler set. The best use of this book would probably be to those children that have somehow failed to learn their alphabet and feel that they are too old for the everyday humdrum &quot;baby&quot; abc books you so often see on the market. Don't get me wrong. There is a real beauty to these paintings. The splatters and messes filling each page are a messy child's fantasy realm. Who wouldn't want to do all the wonderful horrible things this fly is capable of? The fly itself is shockingly realistic. Hairy and gross to the extreme. He isn't given any human qualities or emotions. This is a very realistic old black fly, and because of this, the things he's going to do are going to be a little disgusting. Don't miss the second to last SWAT in a two-page spread of exploding pink and brown cake. Says the illustrator about this story, &quot;This is the first book of the rest of the books I'll illustrate&quot;. I, for one, hope it isn't his last.	2004-02-07

Here is the quote that begins \\"True Confessions of a Heartless Girl\\":<br />\\"The American novelist John Gardner, I think it was, said there are, really, only two plot lines: a stranger rides into town, and a stranger rides out of town\\", - William Least Heat-Moon \\"PrairyErth\\".<br />This book begins with the former.  In it, seventeen-year-old Noreen Stall has arrived at the M.T. Caf&eacute; in a stolen truck, her pockets full of stolen money, and a baby growing in her womb.  She has arrived in a small Canadian town in the middle of nowhere without direction or hope.  Winner of the 2002 Governor General's Literary Award (think of it as the Canadian Newbery), this book is one of the most quietly moving pieces of young adult literature I have ever read.<br />Author Martha Brooks has created a small stirring story.  Individual characters meet and mix with Noreen, showing their own private sorrows and disappointments in life.  The girl herself seems to attract nothing but bad luck and trouble, and it's difficult to see how exactly she's going to change her life around.<br />This is not a story where everything slowly gets better and better for Noreen until, at the end, she's bursting with enough joy and happiness to fill her days.  It's subtler than that.  More realistic.  And filled with beautiful well-thought out characters.  Following in a long line of stories in which a single girl finds herself surrounded by occasionally understanding people, this book is nothing so much as an older version of \\"The Great Gilly Hopkins\\".<br />Moralistic parents beware.  This story does contain a fair amount of swearing (though I was amused by the Canadian/British bad word \\"bugger\\" showing up as well) in addition to discussions of abortion and miscarriages.  And I don't know how interesting this book is to kids and teens.  After all, much of this story concentrates on the thoughts and emotions of the middle-aged and elderly.  Not typical YA fare.  But for any teen that is looking for a book that shows real problems without becoming didactic, preachy, or condescending, this story is ideal.  There are no easy answers.  Noreen isn't going to be saved by the kindness of strangers.  This book deals with the truth and its ending is satisfactory in the extreme.that shows real problems without becoming didactic, preachy, or condescending, this story is ideal.

Originally an opera performed by the children of Terezin (a Nazi concentration camp) for those Germans who had to be convinced that everything was just ducky in the camps.  The children were, needless to say, killed after the final performance of this piece, and so the opera is as light-hearted as it is chilling.  In the plot, two children attempt to find fresh milk for their ailing mother.  Only milk will do.  But they are chased away by the nasty Hitler look-alike, Brundibar, and must gather their forces (some 300 children or so) to face up to the bully.<br />Sendak and Kushner have created a story that fulfills several needs.  It tells a story that has links to horrors unimaginable.  At the same time, they have created a whole new text that deserves examination.  That and it's darned purty.  The pictures in this book are amazing, filled with tiny details that make a person think.  When the brother and sister gather 300 children with them for aid, a Kilroy character holds a sign saying, \\"People are happy helping. It's never hard to find help. It is only hard to know that it's time to ask\\".  The fact that Kilroy is best associated with the American GI forces in WWII may or may not be important to the scene.  At any rate, it sparks dialogue.  The book is Sendakian in the extreme due to the odd combination of realism and outright peculiarity.  The ice-cream seller is going to give me nightmares for months, I'm sure.<br />I don't think this is necessarily a book for children.  And there is nothing wrong with that.  Why can't we have a couple picture books in this world that are NOT for children?  We have animated films for adults.  And video games for adults.  Why not picture books that tackle history and art in one fell swoop?  That isn't to say that this book is inappropriate for children.  It isn't.  They may, in fact, be enchanted by the tale.  But in the event that they are not, it comes as little surprise.  Kids aren't going to grasp the eloquent scene of children flying on blackbirds away from their sobbing mothers.  Or the black smoke that billows from the oven conjured up by the children's singing.<br />A problem with the book comes with the lack of further information about the story's origins.  The story never directly says anything about Terezin, and the brief bookflaps only mention the incident in passing.  Facts (that the children of Terezin died after the show, for example) are not gone into with any depth.  An author's afterword, or perhaps some sort of note explaining what inspired this story, would be greatly appreciated.  Similarly, the illustrations are filled with little details that would yield a lot of pleasure for readers if they understood their significance.  When the children are banned to the alleyway and sit under newspapers, what do the newspapers say?  What is \\"skola\\" as written on the fence in one scene?  Is it significant that the milkman is from Mekos Dairy?<br />\\"Brundibar\\" isn't a perfect creation.  But it's a necessary one.  Even if you don't understand it completely, you should at least try.That isn't to say that this book is inappropriate for children.  It isn't.  They may, in fact, be enchanted by the tale.

Inspired by a nightmare of one of his daughter's, author Neil Gaiman has developed a wonderful terrifying tale.  Lucy can hear wolves in the walls of her home.  She's quite certain of what she's hearing, but her family doesn't seem to believe her.  When the wolves come out, it is (as the family has always said) all over.  Lucy must find a way for her family to retake their home from the nasty, jam-eating, video game playing, tuba thumping wolves.<br />The pairing of Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean on this book is inspired.  Gaiman has often said in interviews that he sees this book less as a picture book and more as a graphic novel.  The distinction is slight.  In some cases the pages are separated into four panels (something you'd see in a comic book and not, necessarily, a story for children).  But I disagree with Mr. Gaiman.  This is a picture book and it shows.  McKean has taken Gaiman's wonderfully twisted tale and created pictures that combine such a huge amount of different media, it could blow your mind.  A single panel might have a gigantic wolf drawn in pen and ink with photos of socks on its feet and fabric beneath him for the bed.<br />Is the story too scary for children?  Well, sure.  For some children.  I'm not going to grab the your two year-old and force them to read it.  But kids with a healthy sense of humor and intelligence will like this book.  It will not give them nightmares.  It will not make them afraid of wolves for the rest of their little lives.  But it will peak their interest and curiosity.  I recommend it.  It's a one in a million book.	2004-02-07

The best known title of any of the books in the Prydain Chronicles (owing, probably, to that horrendous Disney movie from the 1980s).  In this beautifully woven tale, we return once more to meet Taran the Assistant Pig-Keeper of Caer Dallben.  With his faithful crew in tow (Eilonwy, Gurgi, Fflewddur Fflam, Doli, etc.) as well as new companions, Taran sets off to find and destroy the legendary Black Cauldron.<br /><br />Unlike the first book in this series, this story is beset by some small inconsistencies that hurt its storytelling.  At the end of the first book, Taran's hot head had been cooled by actual battle.  He understood what it meant to go to war, and was happy to return and stay at Caer Dallben once more.  Unfortunately, Taran goes right back to square one in this newest adventure.  Again he is the same rambunctious unthinking adolescent he was before.  I'm not saying this is necessarily an inaccurate portrait of an adolescent.  Just disappointing.  It would be nice to see Taran growing a little wiser with each book.<br />Still, there is much to love in this story.  Taran finally meets a boy that rivals and beats him in quick thoughtless action.  Flewddur the bard is still abandoning his kingdom to go fight and play the harp.  Princess Eilonwy is just as feisty as ever.  It's a wonder to think that even though this series was written at the same time as Britain's \\"White Mountains\\" chronicles, this particular group of books stands out for its far-sighted take on women and their abilities.  Eilonwy may not be invited to the men's war councils, but she objects heartily to the fact.  She fights as well as any (considering her circumstances) and is always of great help to others.  It's funny, but you can't help wondering how Taran keeps ending up in the company of so many members of royalty (Eilonwy, Fflewddur, Gwydion, etc.).  They seem to be as numerous as the leaves of spring.<br />In the end, \\"The Black Cauldron\\" (why wasn't it named \\"The Black Crochan\\" as the book calls it?) is a worthy, if slightly less impressive, successor to \\"The Book of Three\\".  Readers who decide to start the series with this book will have little difficulty catching up with the action at hand.

Vaunda Micheaux Nelson has penned an exciting tale of escape and freedom, set before the Civil War.  Children's picture books that follow the lives of slaves always run the risk of watering down their material.  It is exceedingly difficult to tell a story about slavery to little kids without making light of the nasty aspects of it.  In this book, however, Nelson has adeptly told a story of escape through the eyes of a rag doll owned by a little runaway slave girl.  She has done this without compromising any of the uglier aspects of the time, while softening the point of view to that of an inanimate object.<br />Matching Nelson's sure-footed storytelling come the illustrations of Colin Bootman.  His painting style uses thick oils and paints that somehow manage to convey emotion and depth.  And just for the record, the father of the little girl who owns the doll is probably one of the hottest men ever to grace the pages of a picture book.  I'm not kidding.  Go out, find this book, look at her dad, and tell me he's not absolutely drop dead gorgeous.  Wowzer.<br />In and of itself, this book is well-made but not extraordinary.  However, Nelson has included a couple instructional tidbits at the back of the book for further contemplation and understanding.  In an author's note, she tells how she came up with the idea of the story.  Kids can see a photograph of a real black rag doll form the 1800s.  Then Nelson explains what the Underground Railroad was and how it worked.  Finally, a glossary of terms that kids might not be familiar with (dear = expensive) is included for a final considerate touch.  It is not a book that will necessarily blow you away, but \\"Almost to Freedom\\" accomplishes the difficult task of telling a fearful story in a manner appropriate for the young.  No small task.	2004-02-07

The story is a slapdash combination served up in a range of colorful motifs.  In this tale, a young African-American girl's grandfather sends her a gigantic pig named Julius from Alaska.  Julius is rambunctious to say the least.  Though her parents aren't initially fond of the messy (and oh so slightly obnoxious) pig, they keep him because their daughter Maya loves him so.  Pilkey has combined a variety of different drawing styles to keep the illustrations in this tale interesting.  Fabric is used on almost every page as borders, wallpaper, clothing, suitcases, etc.  There's even a lovely patched together opening spread of Maya and Julius as quilted figures tromping through the flowers.  What Johnson has written in this charming tale is matched perfectly by Pilkey's wry flourishes that crop up here and there.  The angry glares Maya's parents shoot the slightly cowed grandfather when they realize they now own a pig is priceless.  Maya herself is so full of life and verve that you want to take lessons from her.  In some pictures she sports a colorful sombrero.  In others, she's in pearls and white gloves (while Julius doffs 3-D glasses).  No child reading this wouldn't want a gigantic pig of their own.  No adult would want to keep it from them.	2004-02-07

After beating his girlfriend, the sixteen-year-old offender finds himself attending group therapy and writing in a journal about the things he's done.  He's the son of an abuser, and it looks like that abuse has surfaced within himself.  The question is, can Nick recognize what he's done?  More importantly, can he change?<br />The premise is a complex one.  Author Alex Flinn set out to write about an abusive relationship from the abuser's point of view.  Now how do you go about doing that, exactly?  How do you write a story in which the reader has to simultaneously empathize with and abhor the protagonist?  The fact of the matter is, Flinn is so adept with her writing skills that she gets away with it.  The result is phenomenal.<br />The real strength of this story is the way in which the plot arcs and fools the reader.  Nick is hardly a reliable narrator (a fact that becomes painfully clear by the end of the story).  Yet when he writes in his journal, he feels unaccountably unable to lie about anything that happened.  Flinn slowly brings the plot in the journal, and the story of how Nick lives in the aftermath of his own violence, together by the book's end.  She does not compromise her position either.  As a woman who served as a lawyer trying domestic violence cases and as a volunteer at the Inn Transition facility for battered women and their kids, she knows from whence she speaks.  This isn't an author who is speculating on what violence does to families and friends.  She knows.  Better still, she can write about it.<br />This isn't a perfect book, I suppose.  Some jumps in the plot are implausible.  Some characters inconsistent.  But what flaws it has only serve to show how strong the story itself is.  There is no book on how abusers feel that is as available and accessible to young adults as \\"Breathing Underwater\\".  You will never regret having read it.	2004-02-07

At the very beginning it's the perfect story to read to any child you want to put to bed.  Halfway through, however, it becomes a lively rollicking/jumping/bouncing kind of tale.  The premise follows a grandmother, her grandchild, a dog, a cat, a mouse and a flea as they all nap (save the flea) on a wet and rainy afternoon.  Slowly, one by one they crawl on top of one another to sleep.  Quickly, one by one, they wake one another due to the untimely flea bite the mouse acquired.<br />Don Wood, the illustrator, has done wonders with the light in these scenes.  The dreary drizzly afternoon pours steadily, making the reader really want to snuggle up in a warm bed too.  Then also, his drawings are quite clever.  Each character appears in every single spread.  The flea is represented more as a circular black dot with a halo about it.  Almost as if the flea was lit from inside.  Kids will probably enjoy locating the mouse and the flea in each and every picture as the scenes change and the characters toss and turn in bed.  In the end, I was particularly taken with the grandmother.  Sleeping in her nylon-like socks, her reaction upon falling back upon her bed and breaking it is one of pure joy.  Atta girl, grandma!  In that second to last scene in the book, daylight streams into the room, the blue walls now a cheery and dazzling yellow.  Any child uncertain of the benefits of napping (of which there may be one or two) will enjoy seeing how lively and boisterous the characters are after getting a good afternoon's rest.  The last page of the book speaks volumes for the benefits of sleep.  A marvelous story.	2004-02-07

So well written.  So unaccountably flawless that you want to take Philip Pullman by the lapels and demand that he show you how he did it.<br />In this second book of the \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy, Pullman deftly continues the story of Lyra Belacqua and her adventures.  Added to the mix is young Will Parry.  A boy from our world, he and Lyra pair up to find his father.  Along the way they find new enemies (like the soul-sucking Specters) and allies (angels, as luck would have it).<br />What makes Pullman so adept is his readiness to shift between a myriad of different worlds with relative ease.  This author can have five different plots going on and the reader not only is able to keep track of them all, but also feels a great obligation to read every single one.  The creation of the Specters in this book is a particularly interesting one.  Similar, in some ways, to the Dementors of the Harry Potter stories, these creatures leave the body alive and wasted after doing their dirty work.<br />But best of all is Mr. Pullman's ability to make you really care about what is happening.  I've rarely felt so invested in the well-being of my protagonists.  Lyra is smart and clever without becoming precocious.  Will is serious and strong without bowling you over with his manliness.  The result is a classic book that will be well regarded for years to come.	2004-02-07

Let me begin by giving full praise to the original cover of \\"The Great Gilly Hopkins\\".  I've seen the reissued covers and they fill me with sadness.  On the original front cover is Gilly Hopkins herself.  Hands placed firmly on her waist, elbows akimbo, she's blowing a bubble the size of her head.  Her hair is short and mousy colored and she's wearing a shirt that I myself wore, I'm certain, in 1982.  On the back cover the bubble has popped all over her face, giving her an odd bubbley mask.  Compare such a beautiful illustration of this human being with the current spunky pink cheeked aw-ain't-she-sweet kid on the current covers.  For shame, Mr. Publisher.  For shame.<br />Now this book is great.  Doggone it, I do this with every Katherine Paterson book.  I walk in with the vague hope of not hating the book (paging \\"Bridge to Terebithia\\") and end up loving it as much as everyone else in the world loves it.  What is not to like about this book?  You begin with a thoroughly unlikable character.  Sure, maybe she's been having some ups and downs in her life, but she's a racist, thieving, conniving little brat.  And doggone it if you don't end up loving the little whelp by the end.  Gilly changes, the reader changes with her, and the people around her are great.  And the ending is far from perfect for poor Gilly, but she did bring it on herself and she's strong enough to survive it.  The book's got pep, the girl's got pep, and the whole thing is thoroughly enjoyable.  Two thumbs way way up for the Gilly gal.	2004-02-01

In it, a girl is approached by a boy from another world.  The two become friends, and he takes her with him into a place that no Topsider has ever seen.  When Lindsay (our protagonist) decides to discover the truth about the Downsiders, her actions have consequences far more reaching than she had supposed.<br />They say that truth is stranger than fiction.  Not long ago I had the chance to see a remarkable documentary entitled, \\"Dark Days\\", by a Mr. Mark Singer.  In it, the documentarian digs deep into the depths of New York City to reveal the homeless people that dwell in the abandoned subways stations below.  The film is an amazing series of stories, showing people with running water and electricity and living their lives out of sight below.  A year before this film came out, however, Neal Shusterman (children's author extraordinaire) wrote \\"Downsiders\\".  A similar, if significantly different tale of underground dwellers.  And, unfortunately, less amazing.<br />Shusterman is adept at weaving innovative ideas with actual historical fiction.  The story of Alfred Ely Beach and his pneumatic subway system, as well as the Great Sinkhole Disaster of 1885 are taken and then stretched a little further into fantasy.  Sometimes these stretches are inspired.  For example, the Downsiders' world contains such splendid places of art as a crystal filled underworld theater and subway token studded walls.  On the other hand, sometimes Shusterman stretches credulity into absolute goofiness.  I'm sorry, but I'm having a bit of difficulty believing that somewhere in the depths of the New York City underworld there are herds of wild bulls stampeding in the sewers.<br />In the end, Shusterman doesn't stretch his tale as far as he could.  He seems to be making some slight correlations between Lindsay's parents' divorce and the relationship between the Topsiders and the Downsiders but no real conclusions are made.  Also, inconsistencies abound.  At the end of the tale, Lindsay's mother appears (after hearing rumors of her ex-husband's notoriety) to whisk her elder child away leaving our protagonist to continue her own adventures.  Why would a mother fear for only one child's safety?  Especially when she spent years living with the other child as well?  Also, the Downsiders write a language of mixed English, Russian, Chinese, and other hieroglyphics.  Yet they not only speak English flawlessly (without even so much as an accent) but they also can read it without difficulty.<br />If you would like a good fun tale about a world not too distant from our own, \\"Downsiders\\" is a perfect Sunday afternoon read.

Also like \\"Bud\\", the book has probably garnered some criticism for its portrayal, or lack thereof, of active racism.  No character in this book ever confronts an actual racist personally.  Though the boys attend public school, there isn't even the slightest indication that Flint was any different then than it is today in terms of racial strife.  The family does stop briefly in Appalachia, fearing unseen racists in the woods about them, but that's the closest any plot point comes to it.  Just the same, the action in these stories is concerned primarily with the interactions between family members, and I am reluctant to criticize Curtis's choice of dramatic tensions.  This is a story I've never seen told in a children's novel, let alone told so well.  The character of By is more than just a two-dimensional bully, and the stories are downright fascinating in a couple instances.  Finally, I appreciated that the narrator is affected realistically in reaction to the 1963 Birmingham church bombing.  His nervous breakdown is done with dignity.  I've only a small qualm with the unexplained event of the boy's sister claiming he drew her out of the church before the bombing.  What does this mean?  It's left unclear, though By makes it perfectly obvious that no supernatural occurrence has taken place.  This book would either pair well with other stories taking place in 1963, \\"Through My Eyes\\", being only one example.  It would also pair well with some sort of a buddy story like the \\"Soup\\" books.  Or it would go well with \\"Stories Julian Tells\\", as a series of tales that take place between brothers.  Reading this book aloud would also work very well.  Because of its humor, it's a wonderful story.	2004-02-01

It has inspired numerous poetry slams in high schools across the country.  The book is beloved and honored everywhere.  I'm saying all this because I have a shameful shameful secret.  I didn't love this book like the rest of the world.  It was well-written, for the most part, and dealt with issues that are very rarely touched on in ANY books today, let alone books for young adults.  And yet I wasn't taken with it.<br />\\"Bronx Masquerade\\" follows the individual stories of the students of a poetry class taught in a New York public high school.  Each kid in the class begins with his or her own preconceptions about their fellow students.  During the course of the book/class, these preconceptions are pounded to dust as the kids write and recite poetry about their problems and dreams.  Grimes is adept at making each individual in the class a different and distinct personality.  In the end, no one dislikes anyone else and everyone has high hopes, or at least highER hopes, for their future.<br />The book is brave and endearing in what it wants to teach kids today.  But there are some real problems with it that make me doubt its future staying power.  To make this book realistic and applicable, Ms. Grimes has given the main character of the piece, Tyrone, some very slangy text.  Tyrone refers to his \\"homies\\".  He ends sentences with the phrase, \\"Word\\".  Now, it's 2004 as I write this, and already I know that these terms are out of date.  Any kid reading these phrases is going to doubt the legitimacy of the text.  In five years, the book is going to seem dated.  And in ten years it's possible the slang will obscure the message and render this book more of a historical piece than anything else.  This is a real shame too.  There's a lot in this book that the author is trying to convey, and in her opinion slang was the best way to become \\"real\\".  The fact that it may doom this book to future obscurity is a shame, but there's nothing to be done about that now.  It was a choice made.<br />Another slightly odd writing choice is how the author uses Tyrone.  As every single person reads a poem the Tyrone point-of-view says something along the lines of, \\"Frankly, I didn't know Raul had it in him\\", or, \\"So, the daydreamer speaks\\".  Tyrone, tough guy, never really ridicules any of the readers.  Not even the ultra-religious Sterling.  This strained my suspension of disbelief.  The story takes on the feeling of a fantasy when EVERYBODY is accepted by everybody else.  Couldn't Tyrone have disliked just one person and not accepted them instantly after reading a poem?<br />Ah well.  It's a nice book just the same.  Nikki Grimes is a poet in her own right.  And each child's writing is unique and distinct from anyone else's.  For those interested in poetry written by REAL kids in the Bronx, you might want to consider \\"I Heard A Scream In the Street: Poetry By Young People In the City\\", selected by Nancy Larrick.  It may have been written in 1970, but it speaks loud and clear to kids living today.e obscurity is a shame, but there's nothing to be done about that now.

But take a look at it, even once, and your perceptions will change instantly.  This book is about color.  And its photographs fairly throb with life and vitality, the like of which you'll have great difficulty finding in any kids books published today.<br />The book begins with a key.  Red, yellow, blue, orange, green, and purple are arranged next to corresponding circles of the same color.  As you flip through the book, these circles appear at the bottom of the page, indicating what colors can be found in each individual picture.  As the kids go through the book, they can flip back to the key at the front to determine what the name of each color is.  As they use this book, they will learn their colors, and eventually be able to use the text without constant flipping backwards and forwards.<br />And the photographs?  As an artist who has shown her works in the MOMA, Toban's photos are best described on the back of the book as, \\"an artistic statement as well as an introduction to reality\\".  The shots are of city scenes, brimming with color and action.  The children caught in these pictures are multi-ethnic, playing and running and posing.  Regardless of where a child lives, this book will inspire any kid who has ever wanted a look at a beautiful multi-colored America.  You could do worse than to buy this book for your kids.  And you could certainly do no better.	2004-01-30

The ultimate example of hitting yourself in the head with a hammer because it feels so good when you stop.  In this retelling of a classic Yiddish tale, the poor protagonist visits the local Rabbi with a complaint.  His house is too crowded and family members are constantly getting in one another's way.  As the Rabbi instructs the man to add more and more animals to his hut, the scene within turns from mildly disruptive to one of complete and utter pandemonium.  When the Rabbi at last tells the man to release all his farm animals from the hut, the man is delighted to find himself living a state of complete and utter peacefulness.  The fact that he cannot distinguish that what he has now is exactly what he started with his driven home by the Rabbi's side-ways roll of the eyes in the book's final picture.<br />The advantages of this book are many.  For one thing, this is a story with a lesson that children will get.  As a kid, I was read this book fairly regularly.  It wasn't one of my favorite stories, but I liked the ways in which Zemach displayed chaos incarnate.  At the end, I sided completely with the fed-up Rabbi.  Why couldn't this man see that everything was as it was?  And yet, the moral was comprehensible as well.  As the title says, nothing is so bad that a little effort couldn't make it even worse.<br />The illustrations in this book are especially impressive.  Set in a small village in what looks to be Russia, the inhabitants of this story fuss, fight, and attempt to do the daily chores inherent in their lives.  The mother cooks, the kids squabble, the grandmother brushes hair, and all this is done amidst charging goats, squawking chickens and howling cats.  There's a real sense of action and movement in this watercolors, as well as an appreciation for the source of the original tale.  A must-have for any collection of folklore, Jewish or otherwise.	2004-01-30

One of the earliest futuristic dystopian tales for children, the story is a harrowing one.  The race of man has been conquered by beings known only as the Tripods.  These gigantic three footed structures rule the earth, controlling the minds of the human race through \\"capping\\".  Once capped, a person is exactly the same, but bound to the will of the Tripod masters.  Will, his cousin Henry, and a French boy named Jean-Paul (but translated into the boys' speech as Beanpole), set out to find a place where men live free, without the caps or tripods.  The white mountains.<br />Now, in my description of this story I've relied on a the old fashioned method of speech that speaks about \\"the race of man\\" and \\"where men live free\\".  Why not the race of people... or where people live free?  Well, to be frank, this book is a bit lacking in the woman department.  Originally published in 1967, it is a victim of its times.  Women exist here as mothers and as docile servants of the Tripods.  In the story, those humans who have been capped sometimes respond violently to the process.  As a result, they end up insane and \\"Vagrants\\".  Usually this happens to people who are strong of will and resist the capping.  The author himself notes that, \\"it happened occasionally with girls, although much more rarely\\".  Sorry ladies.  Resistance must be a manly trait.  As for the girl Will befriends halfway through the book, she is described as having a \\"soothing gentleness\\" and is considered a remarkable woman for it.  This concept of women is more than a little backwards.  Even the photograph of a woman Will finds in an abandoned Paris is imagined in his head as playing the piano (as accomplished women would be wont to do).  The book is now being considered, I might add, by Steven Spielberg (unsurprisingly when you consider that the man is not usually prone to strong female characters in his own films).<br />Aside from the old-fashioned nature of the XX chromosomed, the book has many fine features.  There's a delightful tension running between the three boys as they make their journey.  Will often finds himself jealous of the camaraderie between his two companions, and will lapse into spitefulness as a result.  The story is well thought out and the dramatic high points very invigorating.  The ending, unfortunately, is very sudden.  Not to ruin it for you, but in a sudden \\"TA-DAH!\\" like sequence, the boys find themselves walking towards the white mountains one moment and suddenly IN the mountains the next.  The abrupt ending feels like nothing so much as an indiscriminate stopping point created with the sole purpose of leading the viewer towards the sequel.  And a map would have been a nice addition to the story.  A map that showed the boys' progress from England to the mountains past France.<br />I was very attached to this book while reading it, and in spite of all the problems I have with it, I recommend it highly.  Just bear in mind that unlike some of the other fantasy books of this ilk, \\"The While Mountains\\" has aged a little more poorly than its fellows.rone to strong female characters in his own films).<br />Aside from the old-fashioned nature of the XX chromosomed, the book has many fine features.

About 20% of this book is worthwhile reading.  The other 80% remains historically inaccurate, mythological, or downright offensive.  But I get ahead of myself.<br />In 1940 Ingri and Edgar Parin d'Aulaire won the Caldecott medal for their picture book, \\"Abraham Lincoln\\".  Like many idealized versions of Mr. Lincoln, this book relied on a couple old standbys.  Lincoln was born in a log cabin.  Lincoln wore a stovepipe hat.  Then it adds a couple new myths to the brew.  Lincoln apparently was friends with furry woodland creatures.  He fought pirates and carried a scar from a fight with them over his left eyebrow.  Finally, the book disintegrates into absolute fabrications.  Lincoln, according to this text, was rivals with Stephen A. Douglas for the hand of Mary Todd.  Not true.  He went to war without provocation specifically to free the slaves.  Not true.  But how much can you blame a story that was written in 1939?  It's possible that back then children's non-fiction books weren't held to the high standards they are today.<br />Entirely aside from the inaccuracy of the text, the story is deeply offensive to African Americans and Native Americans.  Here's a bit of what I mean.  As justification for the destruction of the Sauk and Fox tribes (who merely wanted to raise corn on land that had been taken from the Native Americans thirty years earlier) the book says:<br />\\"His tribe had sold the land to the 'paleface,' but Black Hawk said: 'Man-ee-do, the great spirit, gave us the land, it couldn't be sold'.\\"<br />Needless to say, the tribes aren't actually named in this book.  They're simply referred to as \\"Indians\\".<br />And the African-Americans?  Ecoute:<br />\\"The next day President Lincoln walked into the town, holding little Tad by the hand.  An old Negro recognized the long, thin man with the tall stove-pipe hat.  \\"Here is our saviour,\\" he cried, and threw himself at Lincoln's feet.  And suddenly Lincoln was surrounded by Negroes, weeping and rejoicing as they cried: 'Glory, glory hallelujah'.\\"<br />Totally aside from whether or not that actually happened, it's the accompanying pictures that really drill this image home.  The stereotypical African-American with the wide white eyes and big lips is everywhere in this book.  From a slave auction, where a mammy-like woman stands on a podium to the vision of a group of happy former slaves praising their \\"saviour\\", there are repeated visions of stereotypical blacks not usually found in children's literature.  In fact, many of the illustrations in this book suffer from a variety of ills.  Some are offensive (don't even start me on the pictures of the Native Americans).  Some are silly.  There's a shot of Abraham and his sister standing in the woods, stylized tears stuck to their faces.  The picture reminds you of nothing so much as one of those 1960s paintings on velvet of big-eyed children, once so popular.  Some pictures are poorly constructed.  The last shot of Lincoln suffers from such a lack of proper composition and perspective that you could spend hours trying to make it line up.<br />And what 20% of this book is worth reading?  Well, it's hard to get around the fact that there are shockingly few worthwhile books about Abraham Lincoln written with little kids in mind.  If you want a fabulous book for older children then run, don't walk, to your nearest independent bookstore and buy \\"Lincoln: A Photobiography\\" by Russell Freedman.  But for the little ones?  As far as I can determine, this is the best you're going to be able to do.  It does get kids interested in the life of Lincoln.  And it makes him an understandable human being, with hopes and fears of his own.  If you don't mind inaccuracies, the occasional poor illustration, and a tendency towards offensive images then this really is your best bet.ied: 'Glory, glory hallelujah'.\\"<br />Totally aside from whether or not that actually happened, it's the accompanying pictures that really drill this image home.

Admittedly, I'm not particularly familiar with a lot of translated South Korean books for children sold in America.  But due to the fact that, \\"While We Were Out\\", (originally titled in South Korea, \\"What On Earth Happened During That Time\\") is twice as adorable as 95% of picture books written in the English language, it's probably a fair guess.<br />In this simple book, the family rabbit goes exploring in her owners' house while they're away visiting grandma.  The family itself is never seen.  Instead, we follow the rabbit as she traipses from room to room, exploring and testing.  The rabbit applies lipstick to her face.  She settles in for a good movie.  She rollerblades (with the help of some strong chopsticks, of course).  All the while the little rabbit is determining her own taste and in the end she fully believes she's gotten away without the family ever knowing.  There's a cute (and very realistically rabbit-like) twist on the ending of this tale.  Anyone who's ever had a fluffy bunny as a pet will instantly understand that this is EXACTLY how their own rabbit might explore the home.  \\"While We Were Out\\" will not change anyone's life or bowl you over with its style.  It is a sweet simple tale told with humor and beauty.  Just the perfect book for any time of day.	2004-01-30

On is the ineffable J. Giblin (author of \\"The Life and Death of Adolf Hitler\\") and one is Russell Freedman.  Freedman is best known for his well-rounded and intensely researched biography of Abraham Lincoln (entitled \\"Lincoln: A Photobiography\\"), winner of the Newbery award.  Turning his sights to a slightly more modern personage, Freedman examines the life and times of Eleanor Roosevelt.<br />Every biography needs a hook.  It's not enough to lay out the facts of a person's life and let them speak for themselves.  Many times, a work examining a famous figure needs to go a little further.  To find out what exactly made this person tick.  Eleanor Roosevelt's life was not a common one, but it many ways it began ordinarily.  Born to beautiful but distant parents, Eleanor struggled with her plain looks and her inordinate shyness from day one.  Freedman is often in a position to demonize those people in Roosevelt's life that let her down, yet he never wishes to do so.  Rather than actually say, \\"Eleanor's parents were negligent baboons\\", the author instead places the facts before the viewer.  Examining them, we see that, yes, they were negligent baboons.  But we have reached that conclusion on our own, without being told what to think.  So goes the rest of Freedman's book.  As she grows, Eleanor matures, finds strength in herself, and eventually becomes the best known (and most widely respected) first lady of the United States.<br />There are a few problems with the biography, though they are small.  The book allows itself a small flourish occasionally.  One example might be Eleanor's death scene, wherein the author supposes that the former first lady may have seen the image of her father upon dying.  Also, though the sources cited are many, Freedman fails to footnote a single page in any way (a talent Giblin has always excelled in).  A timeline of Eleanor's life would not have been out of place here either.  Just the same, these are small potatoes.<br />This is a book written specifically with children or young adults in mind.  As such, it is interesting and informative.  Beautiful photographs accompany almost every page, and there is even a small photo album of additional shots in the back.  Hearsay and conjecture about Mrs. Eleanor's private life has been ignored entirely.  The book does observe FDR's romantic liaisons (some provided by his daughter, no less) but it does not dwell on them obsessively.  As Eleanor forgives but does not forget his dalliances, and so too the reader comes to forgive (maybe a little less) but not forget them either.  FDR is interesting, but this is a book about Eleanor Roosevelt and the life she led.  Anyone wishing to teach about a popular proto-feminist would do very well to use this woman as their primary example.  Freedman has treated her with the dignity she deserves.  It is a noteworthy accomplishment.out of place here either.  Just the same, these are small potatoes.  <br />This is a book written specifically with children or young adults in mind.

After reading a lot of children's books, a person comes to feel they've seen everything there is to see.  That nothing can surprise them anymore.  And especially, a person may feel that picture books older than thirty years of age are hardly worth crowing about.  Then you read a story like, \\"The Judge\\".<br />In this erudite little piece of work, a judge presiding over what looks to be a nineteenth century town locks up his fellow citizenry one by one.  As each citizen warns the judge that something terrible is coming, the judge pooh-poohs their cries of alarm and throws them swiftly in jail.  With each panicked person, the description of the horrible creature becomes longer and longer:<br /> Its eyes are scary<br /> Its tail is hairy<br /> Its paws have claws<br /> It snaps its jaws<br /> It growls, it groans<br /> It chews up stones<br /> It spreads its wings<br /> And does bad things<br /> If this story were written today the thing would turn out to be something harmless and the judge would let all the people out of the jail because, technically, they were right.  HOWEVER... this story was not written today.  It was written in 1969.  And the ending of this picture book is such a shocking Maurice Sendak-ish piece of work that I don't think anyone could truly appreciate it without seeing it.  As the book's blurb says so clearly, \\"justice is done...\\"  Without a doubt, there will be parents who object to this book's finish as surely as the sun does shine.  But there are also going to be parents with a sense of humor who love this book.  May I suggest you align yourself with the latter category.  It is a very interesting story.	2004-01-30

Hermux Tantamoq lives a quiet life as a watchmaker.  When a glamorous aviatrix, Ms. Linka Perflinger, appears in his shop and has him fix her watch, he has no idea that this simple act will start him on the adventure of a lifetime.<br />This is a story that is as cozy in its way as, \\"The Wind In the Willows\\" with a dash of \\"Basil of Baker Street\\" thrown in for a little mystery.  Unlike most anthropomorphic animal tales with mouse heroes, however, this one takes place in a modern day and age.  Hermux is truly a modern mouse with old-fashioned sensibilities.  The world in which he lives, a large city named Pinchester, is like New York but filled with furry woodland creatures.  Animals shop at high priced clothing stores named, \\"Orsik & Arrbale\\".  They attend fancy spas like, \\"The Last Resort\\".  And they create modern art installations in apartment lobbies.  Sometimes children's authors want to write stories about adults living in adult situations.  When this is the case they usually make the characters into animals, so as to draw in the kiddie set.  Would the \\"Redwall\\" books grab your interest half as much if they weren't furry?  Would \\"The Wind in the Willows\\" even be remembered today?  Probably not.  As such, this is an adult story given a soft fuzzy coating while retaining its crisp dialogue and artful storytelling.  Hoeye is an excellent author, there's no question.  He writes wonderful scenes of danger and daring-do without descending into pulp fiction.  Even better, he has a real ear for enjoyable names.  This book is filled with characters like Tucka Mertslin, Peer Smillendin, Conko di Claramoor, Trubby Tolkstottin, and others.  After all is said and done, it is shocking to me that this book isn't better known to every man, woman, and child in the continental U.S.  For excellent prose and rollicking good times, I present to you, \\"Time Stops For No Mouse\\".  A worthy peer to the millions of other mouse hero stories on the market today.or excellent prose and rollicking good times, I present to you, \\"Time Stops For No Mouse\\".

The story of Leo is the story of many a child.  He does not speak, or eat nicely.  He does not draw or do anything particularly well.  This comes as a bit of a concern to Leo's pop, but him mother reassures him that in time Leo will \\"bloom\\".  The story in and of itself could be made or broken by the illustrations.  Put into the wrong hands, this story could easily have been drawn in a syrupy ooey-gooey mentality.  There is a definite danger of cutesiness.  Illustrator Jose Aruego, however, never allows this to happen.  You've not seen such a sad little tiger cub as Leo.  In beautiful scenes of subtlety and oomph, Leo's environment, friends, and parents are rendered in interesting and unique ways.  The colors are lovely and evocative.  And the emotions of the characters are perfect.  Every stripe on Leo's body is an undulating shade of purple.  Aruego has advanced watercolor to the next level, creating a book that is (no doubt about it) art.  If you like art, or watercolors, or cute tiger cubs, then you won't want to miss out on this sweet little number, \\"Leo the Late Bloomer\\".	2004-01-30

They're just so darn pro-peace.  Didn't used to be that way.  Why take the fascinating novel, \\"The White Stag\\" as an example.  An amazing story that decides that Attila the Hun has gotten a bad rap.  In this book, he's still a psychopath, but he's a psychopath with a mission.  If you find yourself unfamiliar with this literary work, allow me summarize the major points found within.<br />To find their promised land, the Huns go on a years long rampage of pillaging and murder in the hopes of finding their own place to live.  It's like the Old Testament but without any of the good moral lessons.  For its 1937 publication, the book is remarkably pro-genocide.  As it briefly explains, the Huns find themselves in a kill or be killed mentality.  People who see them coming fight them instinctively so that the poor Huns are forced to become blood-thirsty.  They search day in and out for their own place to live, guided by their vengeful god Hadur.  In this light, Attila is the Moses that finally leads his people to a land flowing with milk and honey.  Whatta swell guy.<br />You may have picked up on the fact that I'm being sarcastic.  But how can I help it?  Just note the fate of pacifism.  When Bendeguz, father of Attila, decides that maybe the Huns should settle down in a rather nice land they've come to own and not go about slaughtering the innocent, he is berated soundly by the blind seer Damos.  Those who fight others without provocation are holy.  And those who would rather not go around killing, \\"will be punished for their weakness... Long after the Huns have found the promised land, they will be still homeless wanderers in the wilderness\\".  Um... okay.<br />There are things to like in this book, of course.  The prose itself is evocative and lovely.  If judged on the placement of words alone, this book deserves the Newbery.  And Kate Seredy's illustrations are impressive, there is no question.  They're a series of beautiful 30s illustrations, akin to the kinds of graphics you'd normally find in a Socialist rag.  If you can possibly locate a copy of this book with the original illustrations, you will not regret it.  It's just the moral of the story I have difficulties with.  It's supposed to be: Have faith in yourself and your beliefs and in the end all will turn out well.  Instead it comes off as: Kill lots of people because you're certain your god is the best, and all will turn out well.  Lots of other people will disagree with me.  But regardless if you're a hawk or a dove at heart, this book comes off as little more than a beautiful immoral tale.eries of beautiful 30s illustrations, akin to the kinds of graphics you'd normally find in a Socialist rag.

Above and beyond his myriad of accomplishments (scientist, inventor, artist) his life is one of adventure and interest.  The illegitimate son of a leading man of Vinci, Leonardo went into the artistic life precisely because he was considered too base for a, \\"noble profession\\".<br /><br />This book is a combination of good artistry and confounding problems.  On the one hand, Stanley has drawn beautiful accompanying pictures for each point in Leonardo's life.  On the other hand, these pictures sometimes take liberties with the few details of the artist's life we know of.  When the text states that Leonardo, \\"found a loving friend in his young uncle Francesco\\", the accompanying picture shows the boy piggyback on his uncle.  It would be nice if such facts were given appropriate footnotes, but all sources are listed in the end of the book without any references to pages.  Also, the aging of Leonardo is a little haphazard.  One moment he's a young man writing a letter.  The next moment he's bearded and about to slice up a corpse.  The Duchy of Milan is described as having black hair and dark skin, but appears to be more of a slightly tan Italian.  These are tiny details, but they distract from an otherwise interesting text.<br />Undoubtedly, the actual drawings and sketches Leonardo made in his lifetime are some of the best parts of this book.  It would have been nice if Stanley had included more of them in the story.  Leonardo's paintings are nicely presented, but they're usually seen from a distance.  At no point do we get a detailed and close look at any art that Leonardo created.  Finally, a timeline would have been helpful in this story, but it has not been included.<br />None of this is to say that Stanley hasn't taken a difficult subject and made an interesting book out of it.  The final product is a bit too advanced for those children accustomed to reading picture books, but older kids may shy away from the type of book they would consider \\"babyish\\".

Sometimes I'll stop and look at an Edward Gorey construction (like &quot;The Iron Tonic&quot;) and wonder to myself, &quot;How exactly was this book received in 1969&quot;?  Gorey spent years and years perfecting his craft to the best of his abilities.  In &quot;The Iron Tonic&quot;, hard core Gorey fans will not be disappointed.  Those unfamiliar with Mr. Gorey's books may find this one a poor first showing.  Advertised on its cover as a, &quot;Bracingly Bleak Tale&quot;, it is nonetheless amusing in its dourness.  Using his old reliable pen-and-ink, Gorey follows the trials of those attendees at a gothic grey hotel in the middle of an icy wilderness.  In the backgrounds of many pictures, the observant reader will notice numerous tiny figures dashing around in the background. Objects fall from the sky regularly, and it is not particularly alarming (or unnatural) to find the occasional dead orphan at the side of the road.  I can't say for certain that this book wouldn't be appreciated by some children.  Undoubtedly there are those out there eager to scarf up anything this well illustrated.  But the large majority of kids will find &quot;The Iron Tonic&quot;, unsatisfying, and that is as it should be.  If the large population of kiddie-dom was made up of Goreyphiles we'd be living in an eerie wonderful world.  That day may be coming, but it is not here yet.	2004-01-24

Have you ever entered into a book, not knowing what to expect but suspecting that it's not going to retain your interest for very long?  Knowing what little I did about \\"Child of the Owl\\", I walked into this gem of kiddie lit with more than a little trepidation.  What I found was a story that was funny, touching, and ultimately informative.  I'm naturally wary of books that are supposed to be \\"good\\" for children.  That will teach them lessons about diversity while maintaining a sticky sweet didactic tone.  But \\"Child of the Owl\\" isn't like that at all.  Instead, it is honest-to-goodness gold.<br />The plot is especially good.  Young streetwise Casey must leave her gambler father to live with her Grandmother in San Francisco's Chinatown for a little while.  Laurence Yep has effectively written a tale that captures the spirit of a person never fully feeling as if they fit in.  As the blurb on the cover of the books says, sometimes, \\"you can feel like a stranger, trapped in the wrong place, in the wrong time, even in the wrong body\\".  What makes the book so eminently readable, however, is the care with which Yep has drawn upon his own experiences in 1964 Chinatown, to explain and examine Casey's reactions to life in that once tiny neighborhood.<br />Now if I was going to make a collection of Top Ten Children's Books Set In San Francisco, \\"Child of the Owl\\" would be number one.  It would also be number one of Top Ten Intergenerational Children's Books and Top Ten Children's Books Containing Sarcastic Wisecracking Kids.  Sorry Gilly Hopkins.  Casey's got you beat.  As a heroine she's funny, smart, and filled with reactions appropriate to a pre-adolescent.  I highly recommend this book to any child wanting to learn more about the Chinese-American experience of living in America.  The book speaks volumes to those living then and now.

Books	5	420	439	N	N	One of the funniest picture books you'll ever peruse	Because this book won a 2003 Caldecott Honor, you're probably going to hear a lot of people complaining about it.  \\"Oh the art isn't beautiful\\".  \\"Oh my four-year-old child could've drawn it\\".  \\"Oh it isn't Caldecott-worthy\\" (whatever that may mean).  The fact of the matter is, I was a little shocked too.  This book won a Caldecott honor?  The one where an amusing pigeon tries every bit of persuasion he can think of to wheedle himself into the driving seat of a bus?  Now I've loved this book since it was first published.  When I first read it I laughed out loud.  Quick!  Recite the children's books you love that make you laugh out loud!  Not so easy to think of, are they?  So I've returned to this little treasure in the hopes of discovering why that Caldecott nominating committee loved this book as much as my pretty self.  Could it have been the artwork?  Deceptively simple is the best way to describe its style.  The pigeon isn't exactly a Michaelangelo.  He's drawn with thick black lines, shaded in with blue and yellow.  But has a Michaelangelo ever really amused you?  Look a little closer at this pigeon and you realize the book's genius.  His oversized eyeballs exquisitely display every emotion possible.  From sweet and innocent to consumed with an all-encompassing rage.  The pages wherein the pigeon completely freaks out and screams at the top of his lungs, \\"LET ME DRIVE THE BUS!!!\\" is the temper tantrum of a two-year-old rendered into an aviary form.<br />But do kids like this book?  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the answer is yes.  In fact, clever readers let the kids hearing this tale say, \\"NO!\\" every time the pigeon tries a new tactic.  When the pigeon says, \\"Please\\", the kids say no.  When the pigeon says, \\"I tell you what: I'll just steer\\", the kids say no.  When the pigeon says, \\"Hey, I've got an idea.  Let's play `Drive the Bus'.  I'll go first\\", the kids say no.  And when Mr. Pigeon collapses in a fury, the kids do not relent. Finally, they have been placed in the position of their parents.  They get to tell someone exactly what he cannot do.  And they love it.<br />In the end, it's hilarious.  Who can resist this foul when he pulls every trick out of his feathery bag?  From, \\"How `bout I give you five bucks\\", to a mock-innocent wide-eyed, \\"I have dreams you know!\\".  In the end, the pigeon goes on to bigger and better dreams (complete with CB radio) and the children reading the story know they've participated in the happy ending.  Joy all around.  Is this book deserving of a Caldecott Honor?  No ladies and gentlemen.  It is deserving of a Caldecott MEDAL.  But like the pigeon's, this is just a dream.d in the position of their parents.

A book that's dripping with sweetie-pie sentiments is always in danger of disgusting the discerning (and purchasing) parent.  \\"Good Night, Gorilla\\", on the other hand, balances deftly between sweet and smart, becoming both at once.  In a simple story, a night watchman at a zoo bids goodnight to each of his animals as a sneaky gorilla unlocks them one by one.  The unwitting watchman goes home (animals in tow) and it's up to his wife to put them all to bed again.  If I was a better writer I'd be able to tell you just how cute this book is.  It's SO cute!  But not stupid in the least.  Rathmann has filled this story with clever little subplots that kids will enjoy following.  A small mouse with a banana lugs the heavy object from picture to picture.  Rathmann even goes so far as to wrap a picture on the back of the book's cover around and into the inner fold where the tiny mouse stands by, patiently.  The book also emotes deadpan beautifully.  In one scene the watchman's wife says goodnight to her husband and the page goes black.  Next we hear each animal in the room (that crept in unbeknownst to her) saying goodnight back.  The two page spread that follows is just a single pair of wide open eyes in the black dark room.  The deadpan wit will not be lost on either kids or their adult parents.  If you'd like a book that you can read fifty times over without getting nauseated or bored, find yerself a copy of \\"Good Night, Gorilla\\", and count yourself lucky for having discovered it.	2004-01-24

For a lot of kids living today most of the fantasies contained in the classical canon tend to be Madeline L'Engle, C.S. Lewis or J.R.R. Tolkein.  Which is all fine and good, but once in a while you'd like to see something a little more recent.  None of this is to say that the \\"Harry Potter\\" books aren't classic.  Of course they are.  But the \\"His Dark Materials\\" series (of which \\"The Golden Compass\\" is the first book) fairly reeks of greatness.  It is a retelling of Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\" for children.  It is Dante and Nietzsche for the kiddie set.  And it is amazing.<br />For a lot of books I like to describe the storyline by beginning, \\"The plot is simple...\\".  Not so here.  The plot is complex, but not necessarily confusing.  In a world where the human soul accompanies each human being as an animal companion (or \\"daemon\\"), Lyra Belacqua and her daemon Pantalaimon become drawn into a series of mysteries.  Encompassing everything from the nature of the soul to armored bears to the origin of sin itself, the book it an amazing tour de force.  It has been universally acknowledged as near perfect, and interest in it will only grow.<br />The great irony of, \\"The Golden Compass\\" and its subsequent follow-ups, is the lack of interest the religious right has taken in it.  In a country where \\"Harry Potter\\" is banned like clockwork for supposed ties to witchcraft, here we have a book that is actually saying that the church (in Lyra's world anyway) is corrupt.  So where's the public outcry at Pullman?  The book burnings and rending of garments?  My suspicion is that we won't be hearing so much as a peep about the \\"evil\\" in this book until the movie comes out.  Just wait and see.<br />But is this a good book for children?  Well, yes and no.  If you have a child that is into \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and was able to read his or her way through that entire series, then \\"His Dark Materials\\" shouldn't be too difficult for them.  For others, they may wish to wait a little while before they plunge into its complex weaving of the nature of good and evil.  There are some pretty dark moments in this book, no doubt.  My mother is not a fan of \\"children in peril\\" and this book pretty much infuriated her at its end.  Thin-skinned readers beware... this book is not for you.  But for those adept at interpreting the written word, who have open minds and a penchant for a skillfully woven tale, \\"The Golden Compass\\" stands as the greatest literary achievement written in the name of children since \\"A Wrinkle In Time\\".oo difficult for them.

Take THAT Thomas Mann!  Her first work translated into English (and winner of the Mildred D. Batchler Award in 2003) was the much adored \\"The Thief Lord\\".  Set in mysterious Venice, the tale follows the adventures of Prosper and Bo.  Threatened with separation by an aunt who wishes to adopt only the angelic looking Bo, the two run away to Venice, Italy.  There, they are taken in by a kid known as the Thief Lord, and his raggedy crew of child thieves.  With Victor Getz the private detective on their trail, the kids become involved in escape and magic.<br />Funke has a lot of fun with this book, and it shows.  What kid wouldn't want to run away to an abandoned movie theater to live with his or her friends?  And in Venice at that!  A city of pure mystery, surrounded by canals and winged lions.  In this book, the author deftly captures the spirit of that beautiful town, as well as its history and inhabitants.  Anyone with a child that has visited or will visit Venice would do very very well to introduce them to this little fantasy.<br />Sadly, the book isn't perfect.  Many people reading it are saddened by the sudden switch in genre that happens almost exactly halfway through the book.  Beginning the tale, the reader believes that they are following a realistic story of what could actually happen to two kids on the streets.  Instead, the tale switches violently and is about a magical carousel and the human wish to be another age (whether older or younger).<br />Still, there is lots to love in this bubbily concoction.  The characters are well defined and interesting.  Scipio, the Thief Lord, is a fascinating creation.  No child reading this book wouldn't want to meet him.  And as for the detective Victor Getz, Funke herself has included a dedication in the front to none other than the actor Bob Hoskins (confessing that she believes he'd be perfect for the part).  Who knew the Germans to be such Hoskins fans!  The mind boggles.<br />Like her other American hit \\"Inkheart\\", Funke is quickly making a name for herself in the States.  This particular concoction has elements of Nancy Farmer's \\"The Ear, the Eye, and the Arm\\", as well as a dash of Charles Dickens's \\"Oliver\\".  For those kids pining away for Harry Potter's latest, this book may well make them pine for the next Cornelia Funke novelette.o knew the Germans to be such Hoskins fans!

The incomparable pairing of author David Greenberg and Victoria Chess has yielded a book of hitherto unavailable grossness.  Allow me to say here and now that kids have absolutely no problems with this book.  It's the adults that peruse it in bookstores or stumble across it in school libraries that find themselves completely disgusted with it.  And how couldn't they?  Slugs in ears, slugs between toes.  The whole book is about the wanton abuse of some very large slugs, ending with a twisted sluggish revenge.  The revenge at the end was always my sticking point with the book.  I just couldn't look on it with anything but horror.  But you know what?  That's okay.  This book wasn't written for me, and it wasn't written for you, and it wasn't written for someone's uptight Aunt Hilde living in Battery Park.  This book was written for the children who like their books a little risqu&eacute; and a little gross.  And to this end it succeeds like nothing else in the world.  It's not fine literature, no.  But it's funny and weird.  Seeing that it does everything it sets out to (and more) I hereby christian this book \\"Successful\\" and grant it full accommodations.  Your little ones will absolutely adore it BECAUSE it gives them nightmares.  And as I've said before, there's nothing else like it anywhere.	2004-01-24

Let's take \\"Regarding the Fountain\\" as our example in this case.  Here we have the modestly different idea of revealing a mystery through a series of letters and other forms of written communication in a small town elementary school.  I often have some difficulty determining how much a book should reveal if it wants its child readers to figure out the book's mystery on their own.  In this particular case, I can't help but conclude that the author gives far too much away in a plot that contains too little.  The book is engaging, but it's hard to say if this is because the form itself is different.  The letters, memos, newpaper articles, etc. that make up the plot are diverting, but there are a couple reasons this books isn't going to be remembered in ten years or less.  The illustrations are too cartoonish to effectively convey the story's otherwise realistic bent.  The characters, due to the nature of the book itself, aren't adequately fleshed out.  This applies especially to the students, of which the 5th grade seems to contains seven.  Finally, there's the odd psuedo-romance between the school's 5th grade teacher and the artist commissioned to create a drinking fountain for the school.  With a kind of \\"gotcha!\\" ending it is revealed that rather than proposing marriage the teacher has, instead, proposed painting lessons.  And did I mention the personality of the \\"artist\\"?  Here's where the book tripped from mildly amusing to downright annoying.  What we have in this book is the old story of \\"an artistic teacher/artist challenges the administration's understanding of \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\" and teaches the children that true art is within each and every one of them\\".  Which would be all well and good if (a) this storyline hadn't been done to death already and (b) it had been done well.  The principal of the school continually asks this woman for a price quotation which is comically refused him because, as a principal, he keeps asking his secretary to write his letters.  Which is apparently evil.  So no quotation comes and the reasons why this principal never asked any other vendor for a pricing is left unclear.  Other mysteries abound.  Why didn't the town investigate the sudden disappearance of water when the creek dried up if the economic stability of the city depended on it?  Why would the culprits place large maps of their crime in their offices?  Why would one of the culprits have done it so that she could get rich off of.... a single swimming pool?  Such clumsy mistakes are not missed by children's eyes, and the author of this sordid tale should pray that the originality found in the book's form more than makes up for the lack of originality found in her plot, setting, and characters.g his secretary to write his letters.

Here you have a hero that is an unwanted third child and whose life is in constant danger as a result.  Remarkably, this is the first in a series of books about the life and adventures of Luke.  The writing here is fine.  I won't praise it endlessly, but it has a nice set of ideas that are created in a set order.  This world is well thought out and the people believable.  I enjoyed one character's assessment of government and subversive propaganda, and how intelligent people find the truth somewhere in the middle.  Unfortunately the narrator is a fan of heavy foreshadowing.  There's enough of it in this book to make one feel as if the climactic occurrences that appear throughout the story have already occurred.  In the canon of sci-fi futuristic utopias in children's literature this will not make the top ten.  But it's worth reading and well thought out.	2004-01-18

The simpler the text, the harder it is to come up with something new and original to say.  I just read Donald Crews's \\"Freight Train\\" because it is widely hailed as a good book for children.  The story follows a freight train (after carefully identifying each and every car) driving through hill and dale.  Each car has a different color, following the classic Roy G. Biv configuration, culminating with the impressive black steam engine.  Viscerally, I liked the detail Crews took in illustrating the page presenting this impressive piece of machinery.  Every bolt and curve is outlined in a stately violet tone.  Meanwhile, black steam created by coal pours and gushes from the train.  This is a book about just how impressive the industrial age really is.  The speed of the train is praised to no end, colored cars blurring as the engine picks up speed.  Going through cities the rainbow carriages stand out against the stately repetitive buildings on the street.  For those children entranced by trains (thank-you, Thomas the Tank Engine, et. al), this book encapsulates everything they might want.  Reading it over and over again they'll enjoy the colors and train's increase in speed.  Reading it over and over again YOU will enjoy the artist's use of color and form, especially taking pleasure in such scenes as the train's blurred deep tones as it disappears into a tunnel.  I'll be honest.  I've read more interesting books in my day, and if you are purchasing this book for children that couldn't care less about trains, they may not take to this particular story.  But there is something to be said for beauty in all its forms.  Even, the coal-burning mechanical kind.	2004-01-17

There is not, in spite of the title, a single bust in this book (to say nothing of headlessness).  There is not even, I might go so far as to say, much of a plot.  But what there is lives in superb Gorey glory.  The best way to approach this book is to consider it a sequel to Gorey's \\"The Haunted Tea-Cosy\\" (which actually did include a cosy of spectral proportions).  Our heroes, Mr. Edmund Gravel and the Bahhumbug have finished saying goodbye to the last of their guests for the evening.  Ah, but a creature soon comes to spirit our protagonists, \\"from place to place, where there is shame, also disgrace\\".  The story uses such delightful and little heard words as \\"druthers\\" and \\"aubergine\\" while telling the lightly lamentable tales of a host of people.  Each situation is privy to a little four line poem in the style of a-b-a-b.  The subtitle of this book was \\"A Melancholy Meditation on the False Millennium\\" and by the book's end both the Bahhumbug and Mr. Gravel sit, drink their tea, and think about the new Millennium (looks of horror clearly plastered on their faces).  This being one of Gorey's later works, we can't criticize it too severely.  Mr. Gorey had a style all his own and there is a plot here, buried as it may be.  If you're partial to Fellini-esque tales of woe, you will like this book.  If not, best that you pick up a copy of something entirely different (like \\"Betsy-Tacy\\" or \\"Goodnight Moon\\") and leave this book to those who would enjoy it better.	2004-01-17

There are books in this world that deserve to be remembered and books that do not.  This book is perhaps THE funniest book of the 40s, and it is certainly one of the best.  The events recounted are based in fact (with a little literary license thrown in).  In real life, Frank Gilbreth was the foremost expert in the country on motion study and its effects.  Transferring this knowledge to his home life, Frank attempted to raise his twelve children according to his own unique set of rules and regulations.  The result was sometimes catastrophic, sometimes brilliant, and always funny.<br />As other reviewers of this book have mentioned, this book has nothing to do with the 2003 movie starring Steve Martin.  When I noticed that the poster of this movie was exhibited on the cover of this book and being sold in stores everywhere as its original inspiration, I was a little angry.  The movie and the book have exactly one fact in common.  Twelve children in a single family.<br />Like all books written in the past, there are elements to this book to be aware of.  There's a Chinese cook in the story that speaks broken English and occasionally reacts violently to the children.  When a birth-control advocate arrives at the house, the Gilbreths take the opportunity to turn the situation humorously to their advantage.  But really, in the scope of 40's children's literature, these are small potatoes.  To read this book as a kid is to love it.  Heck, to read the book as an adult is to love it as well.  Ten stars would I give it if I could.  Unfortunately, I only have five to work with.	2004-01-17

Trust me, these comparisons aren't that far off once you've read this book.  This story is a fairy tale at heart, but that heart is a pure one.  In it, a girl with the title's name comes to a very normal high school and (not to put too fine a point on it) turns the place upside down.  This is a girl who'll wear a kimono to school one day, and a Victorian wedding dress the next.  The narrator (who seems to have no family of his own whatsoever) falls head over heels in love with her.  In the end, however, he must choose between her love and the love of his peers (who don't take too kindly to the little strumpet).<br />The story is very simple in its conception.  You know where it's heading long before it does.  As for the writing, the prose is lovely but unchallenging.  Though the narrator of this book is a Junior in high school, I would have to suggest this book to readers of the younger set.  Kids and pre-adolescents.  After all, it has a nice little message about being yourself (without actually voicing those exact words) and contains no swearing, violence, or even (heaven forfend) suggested sexuality.  Read on a different level, this book is almost a Christian parable.  If you read the story with Stargirl as a Jesus-like character, it's not a bad match.  She even exchanges a slap to the face for a kiss.  Turn the other cheek indeed.<br />The ending is bittersweet (hence the Pied Piper similarities) but well wrought.  As I mentioned before, the narrator seems to serve only as someone for Stargirl to react to and garner reactions from.  He doesn't seem to have a home life, or even any parents.  His entire existence hinges solely on Stargirl and school.  In that context, it is easy to see why he reacts the way he does to both her and them.  And certainly the story is unrealistic.  As much as I like the ending, it's not particularly believable that a girl as unique as our pretty protagonist would earn the love of others (especially teenage others) through uninhibited actions. I can see this book joining hosts of others on children's bookshelves as beloved.  And certainly it won't actually change anyone's mind about treating those different from you with kindness, but it's a pleasant story and a pleasant read.as our pretty protagonist would earn the love of others (especially teenage others) through uninhibited actions.

The plot focuses on the real Queen Boadicea (or Boudicca) who fought the invading Roman hoardes in Britain in 62 A.D.  Told from the perspective of Boudicca's faithful harper Cadwan, the story follows the young queen from her birth to her death at the hands of the Roman hoards.  It is a dark story, filled with images of bloodshed and violence.<br /><br />The book was certainly written with teens in mind.  I myself was more than a little shocked when I found a particularly violent passage.  In it (just prior to fighting back) Boudicca is whipped half-naked before the Romans whilst hearing her teen-age daughter screaming as they are raped.  This scene is meant to be the proverbial straw that breaks the camel's back, forcing Boudicca to round up the different native tribes into her war host.  Just the same, don't go handing this book to a ten-year-old who's interested in battlescenes.  I'd even be a little hesitant to hand it to a fifteen-year-old, but that's just me.<br />The author's writing is rather lyrical in its passages.  There are beautifully evocative lines describing, \\"The dark, lifeless and lightless green of forest depths in late summer\\".  At the same time, it can be rough going.  Sutcliff is attempting to bring the reader fully into early Britain.  In doing so, she makes no social comment on war and the cruelty of armies.  Boudicca shows no mercy to the Roman men, women, and children she catches.  This book is filled to the brim with blood, gore, and muck.  It is difficult not to sympathize with the protagonist, but it is clear that she is just as depraved, in many ways, as the Romans she fights.  Throughout the book the author dots her passages with letters a young Roman sends to his mother at home, giving the reader a glimpse of the opposing side's point of view.  Admirable, admittedly.  Yet in the end the book suffers from the greatest flaw of all.  It's boring.  Anyone who has read the author's preface at the beginning knows that Boudicca is bound to fail, and that it is only a matter of 181 some pages before she does.  To slough through this story is hard going at times.  When Sutcliff writes dialogue or action, she is excellent.  But most of the book is bogged down in exposition, and I would be very surprised if younger readers take to the style.  A good effort made to glorify a worthy subject, but in the end a poor showing.read the author's preface at the beginning knows that Boudicca is bound to fail, and that it is only a matter of 181 some pages before she does.

Lemony Snicket is the most recent example, though the patron saint of the style is the indelible Edward Gorey.  In Gorey's \\"The Haunted Tea-Cosy\\", we find a very oddly written story made with more than its fair share of humor.  Even the title is funny.  How many Americans own tea-cosies today, I wonder.  And is the plural of cosy \\"cosies\\" or \\"cosys\\"?  Such answers will not be found in this book.  It is still worth a gander.<br />The plot, such as it is, follows a somewhat \\"Christmas Carol\\"ish venue.  In it Edmund Gravel is enjoying his yearly fruitcake and letter-writing when a large Bahhum Bug leaps from under Gravel's tea-cosy to proclaim, \\"I am here to diffuse the interests of didacticism\\".  I wish more characters in books would say this.  The bug and Gravel are joined by three spirits that show him (in this order) Affecting Scenes, Distressing Scenes, and Heart-Rending Scenes.  These scene include things like Alberta Stipple returning home to find the wallpaper in her drawing room gone.  In the end Gravel decides to throw a party (yay) and the show ends with some suggested pornographic dealings (possibly leading into Gorey's more disturbing story \\"The Curious Sofa\\").<br />Gorey is very much an adult's picture book author.  Kids will probably not be too terribly entranced by his fine pen-and-ink drawings or his cumbersome words.  But he's the best, Gorey is.  No one writes of disaffected despair more lightly or amusingly.  This book won't exactly become a Christmas classic, but its worth a perusal when you find yourself on a overcast Sunday in your home with nothing to do.	2004-01-17

Williams's best known book.  In this story a young girl, her single mom, and her grandmother all occupy the same apartment after their home is destroyed by a fire.  To fill their empty space the women scrimp and save for a big comfy armchair.<br />This is a story of perseverance, but it isn't preachy in any way.  The family looks to be South American, but this isn't drummed into the readers' heads.  All it's trying to do is tell a story about getting what you want when you've faced a disaster of some kind.  Though I've never really been a fan of Williams's art, this book is very well done.  Ms. Williams works with a rough watercolor style that leaves little room for fine details.  Just the same, when the mother in this book sees her house on fire after buying new pumps, the next picture displays the woman, new shoes in hand, sprinting towards the house.  It's the little touches that make any book interesting, and this book falls into that category.  Finally, it's a bright cheerful story that is smart enough to acknowledge sadness and hardship.  An excellent book for kids.	2004-01-17

Kind of pitiful isn't it?  I'm fairly good at ferreting out flaws in books that are widely acknowledged as superb.  Newbery or not, I like changing people's perceptions of old classics.  But \\"Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry\\" was too much for me.  I'm not going to shoot myself in the foot and pretend it doesn't have a couple small problems here and there.  But it is a marvelous book.  One of a kind.  In fact, I highly recommend you read Taylor's, \\"The Well\\", before reading this text.  Taken together the two books span the epic history of a Southern black family struggling to maintain their land.  And that, ladies and gentlemen, is all I have to say about that.	2004-01-17

Two of the most dour staid artists of their day have come together to bring you a work of absolute perfection.  T.S. Eliot is well known as the author of, \\"The Wasteland\\" and other books of that ilk.  So it is undoubtedly odd that he should have decided to write this book, \\"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats\\".  Likewise, the somber (though infinitely amusing) Edward Gorey is often attributed with dark Victorian scenes of murder and amusing death.  Here he has laid aside his more macabre inclinations and produced a series of pictures featuring roly-poly kitties in all sorts of interesting arrangements.  The combination is inspired.  If you have ever seen the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical \\"Cats\\" then I pity you.  You will find yourself unable to read a single one of these poems without the accompanying music jangling in your head.  If, however, you don't find this a flaw, then by all means read this book.  The poems are nothing if not charming.  Where else will you find poetry suitable for children that contains words like, \\"succulent\\", \\"quorum\\", and \\"physiognomy\\"?  And as for Gorey, his pen is without equal.  The book is delightful, and kids (especially those who've actually seen \\"Cats\\") will like it very much.	2004-01-17

The author William Steig will be forever missed for his clever and delightful stories for the kiddie set.  In \\"Doctor De Soto\\", Steig places the action in a land where such stories as \\"Sylvester and the Magic Pebble\\" have taken place.  In the story, animals of all types interact just as humans do, all the while retaining some very wild aspects.  The story takes place in what looks to be the 1930s.  As in Steig's \\"When Everybody Wore a Hat\\", the animals look as if they'd be comfortable listening to the radio and discussing President Roosevelt's reforms before going to bed each night.  Dr. De Soto is a mouse dentist, who runs a quiet family practice with his wife.  Normally, the De Soto's do not treat carnivorous animals but that rule changes when a pitiful fox comes to them with a toothache.  Steig's drawings are sometimes easily dismissed as simplistic.  This is not the case.  Tiny details dot the illustrations, giving each page the feel of a snapshot into another world.  The stairs leading to the De Soto office are separated into two types, large for bigger animals (donkeys, pigs, etc.) and smaller for woodland creatures.  Dr. De Soto himself has set up a series of pulleys that allow him to work in the larger animals' mouths.  Kids will like the book, gleefully observing the picture where a bloody infected tooth is pulled from the fox's mouth (little droplets of blood falling to the ground).  If there is a moral to the story, it's probably to be vigilant.  But who picks up a Steig book for a moral?  This is just a fun piece of kid literature that everyone will like.  It probably works best as an introductory text to the world of William Steig.  Just be sure not to miss it.	2004-01-17

Following up the eleven children's wild exploits, the book continues the Gilbreths adventures after their patriarch, Frank Gilbreth, dies of a heart attack.  Suddenly Mrs. Gilbreth is off to take his place, speaking across the country and the kids are looking out for themselves.  Admittedly, this book isn't as strong as its predecessor.  While it does tell some mighty amusing stories (threatening to roast a peeping tom comes to mind), it peters out at the end.  But there's a lot to love here.  In what other children's book are you going to find a mother trying to find reasons NOT to smoke and failing?  As she lists the reasons not to smoke she says, \\"It's bad for your health.  That's open to debate.  Not so bad as overeating, or not getting enough sleep\\".  Oh Mrs. Gilbreth.  If only you had known.  And this little instance is well coupled with the family's handyman bottling his own moonshine in their basement.  Now, admittedly I'm picking out the tiny sections here and there in this book which, by today's modern standards, make for pretty risky kiddie lit.  My point is, this is an interesting book.  Though dated a little here and there, it still tells the story of a woman of extraordinary strength and resiliency.  One who walked where few others dared in a male dominated industry.  Say what you will of this story, kids reading it will not get bored.  There are enough practical jokes and pranks to fill its ample 237 pages.  Pick it up, and regret will not enter your mind for having done so.	2004-01-17

Rowling may be remembered as one of the best fantasy writers to incorporate humor in her stories, she is by no means the first.  Nor is Lloyd Alexander, but you will quickly forget this fact when you read his works.  Endlessly exciting and amusing, \\"The Book of Three\\" is the first book in the well-known Prydian Chronicles.  In it, Taran the Assistant Pig-Keeper yearns for glory and honor as a warrior outside of his tiny province of Caer Dallben.  While chasing after his incredible ocular pig, Taran meets with an array of interesting characters and must face the horrible Horned King.<br />People enjoy making lists of \\"What to Read After You've Finished All the Harry Potters\\".  This book and its series should top those lists.  Alexander (one of the rare all-American fantasy writers) has incorporated Welsh myth with modern storytelling.  The result is delightful.  I originally read these books when I was ten or so, and though I'd forgotten more than I liked, much of these book stuck with me.  Fflewddur Fflam and his breaking harp strings.  Gurgi, the creature that is nothing so much as a hungry green Grover Monster from Sesame Street.  And the delightful Eilonwy, whose very presence makes Taran even more awkward than usual.  Eilonwy is particularly remarkable in that she is more than willing to fight, work hard, and help others without becoming wishy-washy or humorless.  It is Eilonwy that clearly points out when Taran has failed to take the feelings of others into account.  More interestingly, she is genuinely affectionate towards the awkard hero.  As the aforementioned hero, Taran is interesting as well.  Unlike some storytime protagonists, this boy is flawed from page one.  Hot-headed, impatient, and imperceptive, Taran is only eventually brought to a slow understanding of what it means to be great.  I've always enjoyed the fact that while every other character in this book is described from head to toe, Taran is never clearly described.  Some have theorized that this is because author Lloyd Alexander wants his hero to be a sort of everyboy that can look like whatsoever the reader wants.  Don't let that fool you.  Though this series will appeal to boys, girls will adore it as well.  While drawing on the same myths and legends of Susan Coopers \\"The Dark Is Rising\\" series and creating magic akin to Ursula Le Guin's \\"Wizard of Earthsea\\", Alexander has created something entirely unique.  Appropriate for many many ages.  The violence in this series is no worse than anything you'll find on kids t.v. today, and there is no swearing or suggestive behavior (oh la la!).  Instead, you've got a pretty darn good piece of work that kids will gravitate towards regardless of gender or age (I can personally vouch for all the 25-year-olds out there).ized that this is because author Lloyd Alexander wants his hero to be a sort of everyboy that can look like whatsoever the reader wants.

The story centers on a little girl in 189? named Lucinda.  With her cropped black hair, sailor hat, and roller skates she is a perfect little tomboy.  From the minute her parents leave her in capable hands in September to their eventual return in June, Lucinda finds herself free of the rules that will eventually twist her from a free spirit into a \\"lady\\".  In this blissful state of freedom, Lucinda makes friends with the working class, the poor, and those of other ethnicities.  She is the first to find the body of a murdered friend, she pulls practical jokes, and she challenges all notions of propriety.<br />The book is well-written, and must've been a little shocking for its time.  It's not every Newbery winner in which the 10-year-old protagonist condemns her prissy aunt to hell (unintentionally, mind you) on one page and sings a bawdy sailor song on the next.  Especially impressive is the range of people Lucinda befriends.  From the Irish to the Italians to a Chinese woman married to a white man.  However, author Ruth Sawyer is as much a victim of her times as anyone else.  Lucinda knows plenty of black servants, but she doesn't seem to see any need to befriend them.  The Chinese woman she shares the company of is referred to as a \\"heathen\\" and is eventually stabbed in the back.  This act makes Lucinda a little sad but not overly so.  In fact, Lucinda doesn't really feel sadness particularly well, unless it is transformed into anger.  When a small child who lives above her dies, she takes the news without so much as a tear.<br />Children reading this book may have some difficulty keeping the names of the wide range of people presented in it straight.  Certainly I had to continually flip back a couple pages every so often to remember exactly who such n' such a person was.  The people in this book get about a sentence of description and then are launched into the story head first (something that kids will probably have problems keeping up with).  But otherwise, this is a pretty rollicking book.  Lucinda hardly sits down for even a second, and the story runs over hill and dale just to keep up with her.  Plus, it has the added bonus of displaying a female character pulling a very funny practical joke on her school.  A rarity in any day or age.<br /> In the end, Lucinda is forced by her Italian street vendor friend to acknowledge that once her parents return she will never be able to mingle with people from all walks of life.  It is a sad moment for her, and it's a pity that Sawyer attributes classism with maturity.  Or maybe I'm not giving the author enough credit.  Maybe Sawyer is saying that in the late nineteenth-century there were elements of society that made this sad fact true.  I don't know the answer.  In any case, \\"Roller Skates\\" is a surprisingly good book with a spunky gal who won't easily slip from the reader's mind.

In this fine lighthearted little yarn, author Esphyr Slobodkina reinvigorates the folk tradition with a marvelous story.  In it, a peddler looses his hats to a tree of 16 chattering monkeys and must find a way to get them back.  There is no overwhelming complexity in the text of this tale, but sixty-some years after its original publication there is still great charm in its words.  Accompanying the staid story is a series of brightly colored illustrations.  The peddler seen here is not your classic workaday schmoe in dirty clothes and a five-o-clock shadow.  He is prim and pristine.  With a moustache like Hercule Poirot's, a smart black suit, and a pair of cheerful red spats he is a picture of competence and sterility.  Which makes his eventual foot-stomping, fist-shaking temper tantrum at the mischievous monkeys all the more amusing.  I was particularly taken with the monkeys response to the peddler's demands.  All they say is, \\"Tsz, tsz, tsz\\".  Who knew we shared this phrase with our simian kin?  Slobodkina has created a precise little tale.  Though she never says it, sixteen caps sit atop the peddler's head (his preferred method of peddling his wares, doncha know) and sixteen monkey pinch them.  The combination of bright colors, funny monkeys, and the dapper little peddler man make this a real treasure of 1940s children's literature.	2004-01-10

Once you understand the gist of the books take on life and liberty you can decide whether or not its politics are the same as yours, thereby allowing you to instantly love it or hate it without even reading it.  Books written by adults for children or teens that talk about politics also usually want you to pigeonhole them.  So went my thinking until I read \\"Dinky Hocker Shoots Smack!\\".  Ladies and gentlemen, I have just changed my worldview on politics in childrens books.  And its all thanks to this little number.<br />A plot synopsis.  This is a story about Tucker Woolf, his family, his friends, and his friends families.  In New York city, Tucker is fifteen years old and for the first time in his life hes seriously interested in a girl.  This interest isnt without its complications.  The girl, Natalia, attends a school for the mentally imbalanced.  And her cousin, Dinky Hocker, has issues of her own.  Dinky is overweight, an unsurprising fact when you consider her negligent, often cruel, parents.  From this unlikely set of characters comes a story about dealing with the problems of others, as well as yourself.  Kerr could have easily taken the easy route with this book.  How simple it would be to turn this plot into an After School Special, complete with everyone a little older and wiser at the end.  Instead, the author meets such ooey-gooey sentiments head on, challenging the hypocrisy people exhibit every day.  Along the way, other issues are brought up as well.  Originally conceived and published in 1972, the book deals with politics.  Everyones parent is a liberal of the 60s, though how they display this political leaning differs per person.  When we meet the radical P. John, Dinkys brief beau, the reader is suddenly shown a human being that doesnt fit neatly into any real category.  P. John is conservative, racist, intolerant, and honest.  To read his character is to question everything the book is saying about the political climate of this country.  But if you really read this book, really examine whats its saying, its clear as crystal that there is no single political stance taken in this story.  People are not all one thing or another.  Not all liberals are whining wimps waiting for a handout.  Not all conservatives remain unchanging and unsympathetic.  I can see how people would love this book and how people would hate this book.  All I ask of you is that you find yourself intrigued by this review and decide to actually read this book.  Draw your own conclusions.  Decide Im insanely wrong or absolutely correct.  The point is, this book should never be forgotten.  It is so well written, so interesting and full of great points that I cant even give you a glimpse of what it really means.  Youll just have to find out for yourself..  To read his character is to question everything the book is saying about the political climate of this country.

Aided by their mysterious guardian, Merriman, the kids solve riddles and try to escape the clutches of the Dark.  This is undoubtedly the most engaging book in the \\"Dark Is Rising\\" series, though the later books are certain more sophisticated.  Oddly bereft of magic, it taps into a lot of plot elements that kids love.  Mystery and escape.  A summer free of parents and school.  And a treasure to be found, thanks to a map in a dusty old house.  Heck, it even has an abandoned attic full of junk.  Whats not to like?<br />The kids themselves are particularly engaging.  Cooper has a good ear for dialogue, and the kids never sound like an age that they arent.  Too often Ill read books about eight year-olds that talk, walk, and act like theyre thirty-five.  Here, an eight-year-old is eight, and the reader never doubts the authors tongue.  As for the story, who could complain?  Susan Cooper knows how to instill fear.  Her villains are always most villainous when theyre cool and collected.  Her plots are carefully planned and rarely forced.  And her writing is melodic.  She does suffer from a dire need to often put rhymes and poems in her books that the heroes must solve.  But otherwise, one cannot complain.  If youve kids looking for something in a Tolkein vein, this is the book for them.	2004-01-10

If Maurice Sendak had sat in his office one day and pondered to himself, \\"I should like to stretch my artistic muscles a little\\", he could not have come up with anything better than the eerie \\"Outside Over There\\".  The plot is a classic one.  Big sister Ida cares for her little baby sister while her father is a way and her mother pines in the arbor.  When goblins steal the baby for their bride, it's up to Ida to go outside over there and get her sister back.<br />For those of you who thought Maurice Sendak made, \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" and then just stopped, you are in for a surprise.  This book is a fantastic series of images, exhibiting beautifully a young girl's love for her sibling.  Sometimes thought to be the inspiration for the movie Labyrinth (not true: the book \\"Labyrinth\\" by A. C. H. Smith was the real basis), the book is beautiful in a way that simultaneously enchants and disturbs.  For example, the hooded goblins are nothing more than babies themselves, and clever Ida finds a way to make them dance to their death.  The changeling exchanged for Ida's sibling is an eerie ice statue, the most Sendakian image in this entire book.  As for the pictures as a whole, the author has excused himself from his previous cartoonish style.  The people pictured in this book are strikingly realistic, and they display emotion beautifully.  The tender scenes between Ida and her little sister are touching.<br />This is not a book for everyone.  But then, many of Sendak's books are not for everyone.  To be a fan of the works of Maurice Sendak is to be comfortable with a certain amount nudity and oddity.  Just the same, there are so many things to like about this book that I'd be sad to turn anyone away from it.  I'll say this.  You will never find its twin.  This original piece of work is filled to the brim with interest and imagination, such as you will have a great deal of difficulty finding elsewhere.	2004-01-10

Already an established character in such books as \\"Bedtime For Frances\\" and \\"A Baby Sister For Frances\\", this next story observes Frances as she stubbornly believes that she would like to eat only bread and jam, rather than any other food.  Her parents oblige her willingly, and Frances comes to learn that a person should expand their tastes once in a while.  The book is charming and dated only in the slightest of ways.  Yes, Frances only wears skirts and dresses.  Yes, Mother is the only one making the meals.  But this is such a light happy little tale that these flaws are easily overcome.  Lillian Hoban's illustrations are as cute as can be.  The story itself is amusing (Frances often singing little songs to the food she dislikes out of earshot of her parents).  Sometimes you just want to read your kids something that doesn't involve huge battles, gross out jokes, or didactic morals.  If that's you, then allow me to introduce the perfect solution.... a little number I like to call \\"Bread and Jam For Frances\\".	2004-01-10

It isn't as if the author and illustrator are unknown.  After all, illustrator Crockett Johnson welded the pen that created \\"Harold's Purple Crayon\\".  Yet the book recommended on this list is certainly one of his lesser known titles.<br />\\"The Carrot Seed\\" is a simple story of a boy and his burgeoning carrot.  Informed by his family members, one by one, that his carrot will not grow and that any actions to help it are useless, he ignores them bravely.  Initially when I looked at this book I was certain that its protagonist sported a yarmulke.  This is not the case.  I believe it is more of a jaunty cap.  The book itself is very straightforward, with accompanying pictures of relative simplicity.  Additionally, the payoff at the end is sweet and funny, but not particularly unexpected.  You're not going to find any real surprises in this book and, admittedly, I'm a little amazed that it's so well remembered.  Much of its popularity stems, I'm sure, from the lesson learned.  This is a book about the benefits of perseverance.  If that's your cup of tea, so be it.  But if you'd like to delve into some of Crockett's better works, check out \\"Harold's Purple Crayon\\" or his little known (but lovely) comic strip \\"Barnaby\\".	2004-01-10

Here we have a small simple tale that takes about half an hour to read.  It is quiet and philosophical.  The plot, such as it is, follows a the Little Prince and his petite adventures.  The Little Prince loves a rose very much, but he must travel about the planets to better understand this love.  The book is so lyrical in its simplicity that it's no wonder that it's often given to graduating students each and every year.  More so than \\"Winnie-the-Pooh\\" or \\"Oh the Places You'll Go\\", this book encapsulates the world with pinpoint precision.<br />My confusion?  Why has this book been repeatedly ruined for kids?  Am I the only one who remembers that catastrophe that was, \\"The Little Prince\\", an anima television show that played on Nickelodeon in the 1980s?  How about the movie, starring Bob Fosse as the snake and Gene Wilder as the fox?  How does a book this perfect become so exploited?  I can only liken it to other books of its caliber.  Like \\"Alice In Wonderland\\", the absurd plot elements make the story poignant.  And like \\"Alice\\" (or the aforementioned Pooh) the book's simple writing is easily \\"improved\\" by the adults of the world.<br />I don't think \\"The Little Prince\\" is ideal children's literature, mind you.  Kids may humor their parents by listening to it, but when you sit right down and read the book, it is not gripping stuff.  The patronizing tone taken about \\"grown-ups\\", the Peter Pan-like elements, etc. all combine to make this a book that is ideally for children without actually saying anything to them directly.  This is a book for adults but ostensibly for kids.  Few children are going to be fooled by this.  They'd rather sink their fangs into something a little more along the lines of \\"Harry Potter\\" or Lemony Snicket.  But it is a piece of children's literature that will last beyond all our lives.  This is a classic for the 20th century, and \\"The Little Prince\\" fully deserves to take his place amongst the other classic kid characters encompassed in the cannon.

The plot follows a boy and his father as they make a life for themselves, living in an airport in 1991.  The boy draws hope from their situation by seeing a bird escape the airport itself and take wing.  The book's stark realism has many similarities to the more recent picture book, \\"Visiting Day\\", in which a little girl goes to visit her father in prison.  I don't know if this specific genre of book has a name.  Picture realism, perhaps.  \\"Fly Away Home\\" has often been attacked as \\"depressing\\" and not appropriate for children.  And admittedly, I do wonder how popular it is with the kiddies.  I don't see little children fighting to be the first one to be read this one before bedtime.  But this isn't to say it's a bad book.  Quite the contrary.  The writing and pictures are well done and the plot is informative.  In my opinion, kids who've suffered homelessness themselves will connect with the narrator of the story.  Those kids who haven't, may find the idea of living in an airport fun.  The book really serves, however, as a way to teach our children about homelessness and how those people who suffer from it shouldn't be shunned from society itself.  Should you chose to show this book to your kids, you may wish to tell them how this story could never be written today (what with our heightened airport security).  A fine well-written book.	2004-01-09

This work carries the distinction of marking the first time James Stevenson (the illustrator) worked with the ever popular Jack Prelutsky. A word of advice:  Do not read any Shel Silverstein books prior to this work.  Anything after \\"A Light In the Attic\\" is bound to feel a little paltry.  While the similarities between the two books is striking, \\"Baby Uggs\\" is less impressive.  Nonetheless, there's a great deal of creativity going on here.  Prelutsky has fun with words and sounds and even becomes a bit risqu&eacute; at points.

I hadn't read Shel Silverstein for years until I recently picked up this ancient book of my youth.  Looking at it now, I truly appreciate Silverstein's unique writing (maybe for the first time).  It's difficult not to fall in love instantly with a man who makes cannibalism, monsters, and other ephemera kid friendly.  Not to mention the fantastic illustrations and original verses of each poem.  Interestingly, I saw real similarities with, of all people, Gary Larson (\\"The Far Side\\") down to the grotesque but can't-look-away illustrations.  I would recommend this book to any child I know.  These poems do not date and feel as fresh as when I read them as a young-un.	2004-01-07

The Brambly Hedge books remain one of the sweetest picture book series ever to be concocted for the kiddie set.  Of these, my favorite has always been \\"Summer Story\\".  The plot is not particularly complex.  In it, two little mice (Dusty Dogwood and Poppy Eyebright) have become engaged and they prepare for their summer wedding.  Similar in many ways to Beatrix Potter's books, the Brambly Hedge series is published small, for small readers.  Kids will enjoy the pleasant story while taking particular interest in some of Barklem's more impressive drawings.  Her elaborate Rube Goldbergesque illustrations of the Dairy Stump and Mill are delightful.  There is an attention to detail in these books that does not go unnoticed.  For those kids who are, as of yet, too young to enjoy Brian Jacques \\"Redwall\\" books, the Brambly Hedge series may be right up their alley.	2004-01-06

Forced to flee her father's grand estate in Mexico with her mother, the two make a perilous journey to America and become migrant farm workers in California.  The book is a modified, \\"Little Princess\\", with a far more realistic and satisfying ending.  Characters are presented here with great delicacy.  Esperanza herself must sort out her own previous prejudices, while learning to live as, in her mind, a peasant.  Children reading this will fully grasp everything that Esperanza has lost while truly appreciating the Mexican proverb Ryan has placed at the book's beginning: \\"The rich person is richer when he becomes poor, than the poor person when he becomes rich\\".<br />Though I appreciate much of what the book says, I had my own personal problems with the presentation.  The strikers are presented as alternately foolhardy and violent.  They are lead by a girl, Marta, who is introduced by teasing Esperanza for being once so rich, now so low.  These strikers are never joined by any of the main characters in this book, save Marta.  In the Author's Note, Ryan explains that strikers fought for better living conditions and were sometimes shipped back to Mexico without any justification on the officials' part.  In some cases the strikers lost.  \\"In other instances, the strong voices of many people changed some of the pitiful conditions\\".  Yet we do not see any evidence of this in the book.  Instead, the reader is left with the very clear feeling that it is easier to be a scab like Esperanza's friend Miguel rather than risk everything for the good of others.  I know it is not the author's intent to present this point of view, but this is unfortunately the lesson learned.  After all, in a section where Esperanza fights with Miguel in a field about the hopelessness of their situation, Miguel argues that, \\"everything will work out\\".  Esperanza reacts violently, saying that this way of thinking is not productive.  The obvious conclusion being drawn is that Miguel should do something about his situation.  Quoth Miguel, \\" `You are beginning to sound like the strikers, Esperanza', said Miguel coldly.  `There is more than one way to get what you want in this country'.\\"  Maybe so, Miguel.  But that particular way helped improve the lives of countless Latin American immigrants in America.

Lindbergh: A Human Hero	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Lindbergh in all his glorious complexity	The general idea behind Giblin's book is that Charles Lindbergh was a hero despite his faults and flaws.  Cleverly, he has chosen to present Charles's life in full, making him a understandable character, before later revealing his Nazi sympathies.  Giblin is no stranger to the controversial biography.  His adept children's book, \\"The Life and Death of Adolph Hitler\\", follows much the same path as this earlier creation.  Lindbergh's life was nothing if not exciting.  He became the first man to cross the Atlantic from New York to Paris.  Then his baby was kidnapped and killed.  Then he started spouting racist and anti-semitic speeches in an effort to keep America out of World War Two.  Finally, he worked tirelessly to conserve the environment and protect endangered species for the rest of his life.  If you examine these facts as a whole, you find it difficult to pigeonhole this fascinating human being.  Giblin has presented his subject honestly.  People who see Lindbergh as a hero and people who see him as a racist traitor will both enjoy this riveting biography.  To his credit, Giblin never shies away from the negative aspects of his otherwise beloved subject.  Though he offers several possible explanations for Lindbergh's relentless isolationism, he lets the viewers come to their own conclusions about this tarnished man.<br />Giblin is to be commended for his research as well.  There is no fact presented in this book that is not backed up by rigorous sourcenotes.  An adept timeline, index, and bibliography appear in the back of the text.  Personally, I find it difficult to forgive Lindbergh his crimes.  Just the same, I cannot help but find things to admire about him, all thanks to Giblin's amazing skills as a children's biographer.  This book is a full-scale biography that every student of history should read.	2004-01-06

Karen Hesse has taken the Dust Bowl and narrowed her focus to a single family living in Oklahoma in 1934.  Through the eyes of fourteen-year-old Billie Jo, the reader is treated to a series of poems describing the catastrophic events that come from living in a world of dust.  Each poem is a small masterpiece, slowly expanding to give the inhabitants of Billie Jo's small Okalahoma town depth and purpose.  You meet families migrating west to California, bums on railroad tracks.  There are abandoned babies and musicians with names like Mad Dog Craddock and the Black Mesa Boys.  To read this book is to find yourself completely immersed in the Depression with Hesse's voice ringing true on every page.  The form of this book is perhaps the most impressive.  Pulling off a successful book with a plot made entirely in verse is incredibly difficult.  Imagine trying to write convincing character development through poetry alone.  Fortunately, Hesse is up to the challenge and goes above and beyond the call of duty.  You're in safe hands with this adept author.  Just don't feel surprised if you suddenly find yourself fighting urges to shower after every dust-thickened line.	2004-01-06

Originally conceived in the 60s as a knock-off Hardy Boys series, the adventures follow three boys who run their own detective agency.  One boy is the nerdy smart one, one boy is the brawn, and one boy (Jupiter Jones: former child model) is the leader of the crew.  The boys set their headquarters in an old mobile home trailer, hidden beneath a pile of junk at the Jones Salvage Yard.  Their mysteries tended to mimic that of Scooby Doo in some ways.  In each book someone is threatened by a supposed supernatural force.  It is up to our three intrepid explorers to solve the mystery and save the day.  For a time, Alfred Hitchcock allowed his name to be associated with the series, even going so far as to include a special note at the beginning of every mystery.  In time, however, his name was dropped and \\"Alfred Hitchcock and The Three Investigators\\" was shortened to the less wordy, \\"The Three Investigators\\".  As a young girl, I loved these superficially male books.  Who doesn't want a secret headquarters under a junkyard?  Or to solve mysteries with names like, \\"The Secret of Skeleton Island\\" or \\"The Mystery of the Talking Skull\\".  These books are so enjoyable that kids of every gender will gravitate towards them.<br />This particular mystery, \\"The Mystery of the Whispering Mummy\\" is a good starter Three Investigators book.  In it, the tale follows a mysterious mummy, known to whisper Egyptian incantations in the dead of night.  When the mummy disappears without a trace, the three boys have to separate fact from fiction in an effort to locate its remains and solve its loose tongue.  Lots of fun and surprisingly absent of Arab stereotypes.  The boys make friends with an Egyptian lad and his part is played out without any racial barbs or slurs (amazing, due to the book's original 1965 publication).  Enjoy this rollicking adventure and expect a good time.	2004-01-06

It was worth the wait.  This story departs from the usual World War Two fiction genre by placing the story in a unique setting with a different perspective.  Everything occurs in Denmark, and we see the story unfold through the eyes of young Annemarie Johansen.  Though she is not directly threatened by the actions of the Nazis that have invaded her peaceful country, her best friend Ellen Rosen is.  Annemarie must use her head to save her friend from the concentration camps while endangering herself.  I was impressed with the fact that the threat presented by the Germans in this book was made real without relying on gory details.  In this way, Lowry has created a book about the Holocaust that is appropriate for juvenile readers.  Be warned: There is no perfectly happy ending at the end of this story (the reader is not absolutely certain that the Rosenbergs have escaped and are coming back) but it should satisfy most children.  Well worth a read.	2004-01-06

The book is beautifully illustrated with explanations included (for adults) about the choice of creation stories, and the categories they fall into.  Reading this reminded me of the books of Greek myths I once read as a child.  However, nothing I've ever seen compares to the beauty found within this collection's pages.  Easily concerned parents beware.  These stories haven't been rendered politically correct, nor have they been altered for modern sensibilities.  In many tales, women are usually the catalysts of any problems with the world and violence occurs with steady regularity.  Do not let this put you off.  Though different, this is a text that deserves to be seen by all children from all walks of life.	2004-01-04

The story contains remarkable characters of every shape and kind.  Speaking as one who's a fan of any book with a strong female at the story's helm, I couldn't help but be impressed that Levine made certain that her heroine, Ella, never become defined solely by her curse.  All in all this novella is well written, if a bit too reliant on stereotypes.  One such example involves the girls that eventually become Ella's step-sisters.  You know that they are evil because they are fat and stupid.  I had little difficulty disliking them when they were cruel, but at the same time it was hard not to object to the constant references to their eating.  Apparently such gluttony is a sign of pure wickedness.  Sorry, but aren't there ways to display evil in slightly more malicious ways?  All in all I liked the story's moral and Ella's unique method of breaking the curse.  Now with a potentially popular movie on the way, expect to be hearing a lot more about this little story as girls everywhere discover it.	2004-01-04

This book was read to me when I was a child and I hadn't felt any need to look at it since.  This is probably due to the fact that as a kid I just couldn't get into the story.  Hoping to see what my nine year-old self couldn't, I decided to give Ms. Willard another go.  Rereading it now, I can see where my frustration came from.  The plot is very loose, the poems nice but unconnected, and the pictures beautiful but flat and without motion.  Frustrations I experienced as a child included things like seeing the Man With a Marmelade Hat illustrated with a hat that clearly wasn't the color of marmelade.  Also, I was quite certain that the poems in the book MUST have been written by Blake.  Confusingly, they are actually written by the multi-talented Nancy Willard with nary a Blake quote in sight.  Though a winner of both the Newberry Medal and a Caldecott Honor, I get the feeling that this is a book that adults would enjoy much more than children.  Undoubtedly there will be some children out there that prove me wrong.  But I feel this book is meant to be read by adults for adults.  It is beautiful and nice to look at.

Their other works include a whole new version of the old L'il Black Sambo story.  Far more daringly is this collection; a retelling of the classic Uncle Remus stories.  There is much to admire in this collection and a little to criticize.  Admirable are the ways in which the stories are made interesting for kids today.  The character of Uncle Remus has been made omnipresent.  No longer are there pictures of little white children crouching at his feet.  Instead, his narration encompasses everything that happens, and his humor infuses each and every story.  Less admirable are some of the the more  modern twinges placed here and there.  Sometimes the narrator will mention a shopping mall or a pair of expensive running shoes.  These \\"updates\\" seem to date an otherwise modern story.  The violence found in these tales often seem straight out of a Grimm fairy tale.  They are a bit similar in the methods of killing (boiling with water, burning alive, etc.).  It is difficult in this day and age to find such tireless reworkings of classic American stories.  Stories that should never be forgotten because they represent a part of our American past.  If you have any interest at all, or nostalgia for, these tales then read this book immediately and do not dilly dally.	2004-01-04

Letting it go too soon is one of my great regrets\\".<br />Perhaps this explains why this is, to me, the most frustrating book I've read in a long time.  Not frustrating because it is bad or frustrating because it is unreadable.  It is frustrating because it is incomplete.  What you have here is the shell of what could well be an interesting and scintillating novel.  Reading the first few chapters I had the distinct feeling that I was missing something.  To read, \\"Everything On a Waffle\\", is to float on the surface of a series of grand ideas without ever getting a good look at the depths beneath.  The plot, as it is, concerns the young Primrose Squarp and her single-handed refusal to believe her parents are dead after being lost at sea.  As the Library of Congress describes it, Primrose, \\"recounts her experiences and all that she learns about human nature and the unpredictability of life...\\".  This is true to a certain extent.  Horvath is definitely intent on showing how each human being's life is a separate interesting creation and how we shouldn't write off anyone, no matter how odd.  I like Horvath's characters.  I like her ideas and her wonderful sentences like, \\"Uncle Jack looked like a pig, albeit a lean, good-looking pig, whereas Miss Honeycut looked more like a turtle\\".  I like so much of this book that it absolutely kills me that it should be so sparse and spare.  Plot points, when the author deems them important, suddenly appear out of the blue without a proper entrance or exit.  I had to reread the entire first chapter twice, being very careful to read every single word of the text.  God help you if you decide to skip a sentence here or there.  This is not a large book and gigantic plot twists usually include two slapdash phrases, hidden in slightly longer paragraphs.  The story as it stands is fine, though a little odd.  Here we have a character who believes her parents are alive and is relentlessly mocked by the townspeople for her refusal to grieve.  Honest to goodness, I thought the book would end with Primrose's final acceptance that her parents really were gone and she should stop daydreaming and injuring herself by accident (which she does with frightening regularity) and instead rejoin life.  Instead, a faux-happy ending is tacked on, suddenly turning a rather good and realistic kid's book into a fairy tale.  I didn't want to read a fairy tale, Miss Horvath.  I wanted to read a great story, and you came so close to delivering the goods I could cry.  Please, in the future don't settle for a falsely everything-is-fine tra-la tra-la ending.

One person says the first line of a favorite book of theirs and the other person guesses the piece of literature quoted.  \\"Monster\\"'s first line is a doozy, and I doubt anyone, once hearing it, could do anything but guess its title correctly.<br />\\"The best time to cry is at night, when the lights are out and someone is screaming for help\\".<br />So writes Steve Harmon, the sixteen year-old accused felon and hero of this story.  Myers adeptly creates a new form of fiction in this Printz winner of a book.  Finding jail too painful to endure, Steve recounts his life and court appearances by styling his journal in the form of a movie.  The title of this movie \\"Monster\\" refers to a statement made by the leading prosecutor about Steve, the defendant.  Falsely accused of aiding and abetting a robbery and consequent murder of a local drugstore and its manager, Steve recounts his current status, his past hopes and dreams, and the pain he must endure day to day.  Kids reading this book might have some difficulty grasping exactly how this book's protagonist is connected to the murder.  Certainly there isn't a detailed description of the extent to which Steve was connected to the killers in the neighborhood.  But Myers gives his readers a lot of credit, believing they'll figure out what's going on, on their own.  Steve's experiences in jail are a pared down version of the t.v. show \\"Oz\\".  There are several references to sexual assault, in addition to violence and some mild language.  I wouldn't be handing this book to your five-year-old but for any kid that's curious about jail or being \\"tough\\", this book can do you no wrong.	2004-01-03

In the fantasy literature genre of juvenile books boys enjoy, writers tend to have a great deal of difficulty writing strong female characters.  Just look at C.S. Lewis's \\"The Narnia Chronicles\\", where women are not allowed to fight, for example.  Normally, such books will contain a single strong female character and that's the end of that.  There's one in Lloyd Alexander's books, one in the \\"Wrinkle in Time\\" books, one in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" books, one in the \\"Harry Potter\\" books, etc.<br />That said, imagine my surprise and delight when I discovered \\"Redwall\\".  The story of a small mouse defending his Abbey has become a modern classic.  And how many female warriors are in this book?  I honestly can't say because they FILL the pages of this rightly popular series.  Where else can you say that?  Boys love the \\"Redwall\\" books, and for good reason.  These readable little gems of fiction are packed with beautiful language, images, and prose that teach without seeming to.  Want your kid to learn words like \\"tranquility\\" and \\"sibilant\\"?  Want them to be interested in something that takes violence and war with an attitude that isn't flip or offhand?  Want them to be entranced by fine storytelling?  Finally, do YOU want to read something yourself that draws heavily on British culture and traditions without falling into remarkably dull passages for pages at a time?  If so, I recommend \\"Redwall\\" wholly and without hesitation.  And with its books being cranked out regularly by Mr. Jacques, I'm happy to say that there will be more and more of these beauties as time goes by.	2004-01-03

Nonetheless, the Sally Lockhart trilogy remains one of Philip Pullman's best known mystery series for the kiddie set.  Following the trials and tribulations of Sally Lockhart, a sixteen-year-old orphan, the author deftly describes an 1872 London in all its foul glory.  In this book you've  the elements of a penny dreadful.  An adorable urchin boy, an ancient evil woman, pirates, opium, a heroine and her intrepid hero, etc.<br /> The series is not unlike that of Elizabeth Peters's beloved Amelia Peabody mysteries, come to think of it.  In both cases a woman living in Victorian England must deal with mysteries and murder while retaining her head (and sense of humor).  But while the Amelia Peabody books are for adults and strictly pro-colonial, the Sally Lockhart series is for teens (the violence and sexual references, unfortunately, make this necessary) and post-colonial.  Pullman has taken a genre of fiction and given it depth and heart.  This book admits wholeheartedly that England was responsible for growing opium in India and forcing China to purchase it (even going so far as to point out that the stuff was stamped with the queen's official seal).  There is a Chinese pirate in this book, the villainous Ah Ling, but he is just as Dutch as he is Chinese.  Pullman isn't going to lure the reader into believing the smog filled evenings of 19th century London were all Sherlock Holmes and Dickens.  Crimes were made and lives were destroyed in this violent ignorant time.<br />That said, \\"The Ruby in the Smoke\\" is not Pullman's best book.  Those readers spoiled by \\"His Dark Materials\\" are going to find the going here rather light.  Nonetheless, Pullman knows how to knit a good yarn.  Action scenes are ah-plenty and downtime is ah-few.  If you'd like a rip-roaring story to get you through the day, you could do no better than to pick this puppy up and read it cover to cover.ck this puppy up and read it cover to cover.	2004-01-03

First of all, I'm a big fan of reading children's books from the library but it takes a great deal of effort on my part to actually go out and BUY any books.  Why bother?  Most are perfectly good, but it's the rare book indeed that forces me to remove my wallet from my pocket and give away my well earned dollars and cents.  I read \\"The Wee Free Men\\" in my local library, expecting something light and interesting.  After finishing the book I immediately purchased this book from my local independent bookseller and never regretted my decision.<br />\\"The Wee Free Men\\" is the story of Tiffany Aching, nine years old and determined to become a witch someday.  She's not entirely certain how to do so, but there's a no-nonsense spunk to Tiffany that's going to figure it out somehow.  Unfortunately, her little brother Wentworth is stolen by the Queen of the Elves (ala \\"The Snow Queen\\") and it's up to Tiffany to grab her frying pan and rescue him (ala \\"Labyrinth\\").  Along her way she's joined by a clan of six-inch-high blue fairies, The Wee Free Men, who aid Tiffany along her way.<br />Nothing I've written here is going to necessarily make you want to buy or even read this book.  So please read the following selection from the book.  In this scene Tiffany has crossed over into the Queen of the Elves' land where dreams become reality.  She finds herself in a posh party with the Wee Free Men (known amongst themselves as the Nac Mac Feegle), all dressed in tiny tuxes.  They decide to interrogate the guests.<br />Even in a dream, even at a posh ball, the Nac Mac Feegle knew how to behave.  You charge in madly, and you screamed . . . politely.<br /> \\"Lovely weather for the time o' year, is it not, ye wee scunner!\\"<br /> \\"Hey, jimmy, ha'ye no got a pommes frites for an ol' pal?\\"<br /> \\"The band is playin' divinely, I dinna think!\\"<br /> \\"Make my caviar deep fried, wilya?\\"<br />I love that scene.  I love this book.  For those of you who read Terry Pratchett's Discworld series relentlessly, this book will not disappoint.  For those of you who have never read a single Terry Pratchett book and have had no desire to do so until now, this book stands on its own as a worthy story in its own right.

I'm a Hyman fan to begin with, and in no other version of this story will you find as perfect a melding of picture and text.<br />That said, this is a fabulous book, creating a historical figure that extends above and beyond that of the better known Laura Ingells Wilder.  Both Laura and Caddie's stories were published in the 1930s and both concern pioneer girls living in the Midwest in the 1800's.  There all similarities stop and Laura must bow down to the better book.  The difference between the two (and the subsequent superiority of Brink's text) comes from the amount of interest children take in the books.  While the \\"Little House\\" books are historically accurate and will repeat with perfect detail the intricacies of pioneer life, the \\"Caddie Woodlawn\\" books show the heart and soul of the people of that time.<br /> \\"Caddie Woodlawn\\" was fascinating to me as a child.  In what other book could you find a red haired heroine bravely crossing the frozen river on her horse to warn the local Native Americans of imminent danger?  The presence of the Indians in this book is a complex one.  The book is certainly a product of its times, to some degree.  Children with multi-racial parents are referred to as \\"half-breeds\\" and Indian John (as the pioneers call him) has a stilted speech not found in more sensitive novels today.  Just the same, a children's book that makes the bold assertion that white pioneers were far more likely to go about massacring the natives than vice versa is a bit of fresh air.  Say what you will of the Woodlawns's acceptance being \\"inaccurate\\", it improves the novel heartily.<br /> Finally, \\"Caddie Woodlawn\\" is just a lot of fun.  Practical jokes, adventures, and creative methods of amusement fill the pages of this story.  You empathize completely with Caddie when she feels the urge to tease her snobbish oh-Boston-is-heaven-on-earth cousin Annabelle.<br />If asked who the most amusing redhead of children's literature in the English language is, I'd eschew Pippi Longstocking and Anne of Green Gables any day in favor of that fantastic and amusing Caddie Woodlawn.h oh-Boston-is-heaven-on-earth cousin Annabelle.  <BR>If asked who the most amusing redhead of children's literature in the English language is, I'd eschew Pippi Longstocking and Anne of Green Gables any day in favor of that fantastic and amusing Caddie Woodlawn.	2004-01-03

In this classic tale the ever androgynous looking Sal and her mother go blueberry picking in the wild outdoors.  Sal, voracious for blueberries, loses her mother and attaches herself to a mother bear, just as the bear's child loses its mother and attaches itself to Sal's.  The swap is easily cleared up and in the end no harm is done.  Sal's mother, seeing that her child is a baby bear and not her own kid, doesn't seem particularly alarmed by the odd turn of events.  She is wary of the bear (a wise thing to be) but finds her own child quickly and easily.  This is a charming little story.  Sweet and simple.  McCloskey's illustrations and text have lasted for at least fifty years, and will undoubtedly last another fifty.  Some scenes are absolutely entrancing as well.  As Sal walks around a large boulder in search of her misplaced parent, McCloskey's lines display a real sense of human movement.  This is such a charming story that I would recommend it to anyone anytime.  It is rare to meet the ageless text, but in this book you have exactly that.	2004-01-03

Take \\"The Best Christmas Pageant Ever\\" for example.  Read that book through and then try to watch a pageant on your own without remembering the book's fantastically written scenes.  Good writing engenders creative thinking.  So a large amount of cred should fall on M.T. Anderson's \\"Feed\\".  Though it admittedly has a number of strikes against it, I challenge you to walk around a mall or watch television after reading every word of this beautifully thought out book cover to cover.  If you don't, consequently, find yourself trapped in the eerie uber-consumerism of this modern day and age, then obviously you were only skimming this clever little novella.  And I wouldn't be able to blame you.  Anderson has undertaken a very difficult task.  First of all, this kind of message has (to some extent) been done to death.  Yes yes yes, the world is full of too much advertising and consumerism.  Yes yes, it's bad.  We know.  Thank you.  Second, he has placed his book in the future and has invented a kind of futuristic slang that, while interesting and consistent (Mr. Anderson never errs or disobeys his own rules) is nonetheless difficult to get into.  Some readers are going to have difficulties dealing with people calling one another \\"unit\\" (an upgrade on our currently popular \\"dude\\") or saying things are \\"meg\\" this and \\"meg\\" that.  It is meg annoying at first (see?), but keep at it.  Read on and this brave little new world becomes incredibly interesting.  Here, humans that can afford it are wired directly to the internet.  Forget having the web on the brain.  Now the web is IN your brain, controlling the human body's daily functions and activities.<br />Today, teens hungry for futuristic sci-fi can have their fill with such titles as \\"Jennifer Government\\", but I give this book, in particular, a lot more credit.  The author takes this world to its obvious extreme, making a girl who is a poor consumer into a victim of corporate medical care (or in this case, poor tech support).  More importantly, the author never loses sight of certain facts.  Our hero is undoubtedly rich and his moneyed family allows him a greater amount of leeway with things like school trips and purchases.  His poorer girlfriend suffers from living in a world where consumerism has been literally wired to the brain.  It is this character that will readily point out that many Americans do not have access to \\"the feed\\", their name for the internal internet link.  The poor are always with us.  They just don't advertise their existence particularly well.  This book is basically the adventures of a very average joe schmoe who doesn't really care for international strife (of which there is quite a lot) or anything particularly unpleasant (his girlfriend's physical collapse being an excellent example).  And how different is this charming young man from most Americans today?  His is a world where the feed, in Homer Simpson's words, \\"Isn't afraid to tell the truth.  That everything's just fine\\".

Please bow, one and all, for the premiere sci-fi children's author of the day.  The successor, to my mind, of Madeline L'Engle with a hint of Mildred Taylor for flair.  She won me over initially with her extraordinary \\"The Ear, the Eye, and the Arm\\" and reeled me in completely with \\"House of the Scorpion\\".  In this, her latest offering, the moral implications of cloning and the drug wars are brought to terrifying extremes.  And yet who knew that organ farming could be so readable?  The main character, Matteo, is followed from his very conception to the age of fourteen.  The book does not, surprisingly, dwell too closely on the nature of existence and Matteo's own appearance on the globe.  Instead, it chooses to simply lay out a world in which the drug lords of South America have created their own land and laws.  The book abounds with interesting characters and ideas.  Though I found it odd that member of the Alacran clan would openly despise their leader's clone before him, there are few missteps in this powerful novel.  That it was a Newberry Honor Book impresses me especially.  Some parents will undoubtedly find the depictions of violence that spot this book (and they do certainly crop up at regular intervals) too much for younger children, just as older kids will adore the gorier details.  Like \\"The Ear, the Eye, and the Arm\\", this is a wordy tale.  It is 380 pages in length and it feels it.  And truthfully, the first false climax, when Matt escapes the land of Opium, seems as if it should be the end of the book, only to open up into a whole new story.  I would be very interested to know if any teachers have read this book to their students.  Just the same, consider this book highly recommended and Ms. Farmer a master of wordplay.	2004-01-02

Garth Nix is quickly becoming THE name to know in children's fiction.  While reading Lee Galda and Bernice Culinan's book, \\"Literature and the Child\\" the author's mention that this book, \\"Shade's Children\\" is an important science fiction book for young adults today.  Just the same, I was incredibly reluctant to pick up this book in the first place.  The plot hinges on incredibly repugnant violence done to children in the near future.  I'm not fond of the \\"children in peril\\" genre and this is probably the quintessential children in peril novel.  That said, once picked up this book cannot be put down.  Nix's writing shares a quality with that of the better known J.K. Rowling.  Readability.  In both cases, their books are well-paced adventure stories that many readers find near impossible to stop reading.  In this particular book's case, I was put off by the nature of the subject, yes.  But there is a lot to love in this novel, and the fact that I, personally, do not care for horror does not mean that this book is poorly written.  On the contrary, there is a real care taken with the story and characters.  The plot is simple.  Beings from another dimension (Overlords) have removed all adults from the world.  The remaining children are systematically farmed to create large bio-mechanical robots that serve to fight one another and catch more children for something called \\"The Meat Factory\\".  The only one capable of defeating these creatures is computer created from a man's memories named Shade and his band of ragamuffin children.  So there is blood and gore galore but there is also an intriguing storyline with a cast of characters you come to know and love.  This is certainly not a book for young children but teens and pre-teens will undoubtedly (if they're horror fans) adore it.  Much like Stephen King, Nix knows how to write a good scary story.  He spots his text with Shade's archived videos, instructions, and recorded dialogue of his students.  Characters have very realistic urges (if you don't care for sex talk, don't peruse this book) and they live with individual personalities.  All in all, you can't help but respect the writing, if nothing else.have very realistic urges (if you don't care for sex talk, don't peruse this book) and they live with individual personalities.

Far fewer people have read these light lovely little books than seen their animated semi-accurate Disneyfications.  Should the average reader choose to actually read, &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot;, they'd find a series of adventures set in a child's safe/tame landscape.  The great recommendation of this book (and its subsequent sequals) is the jokes that kids won't get but that adults will adore.  Aside from some of the more C.S. Lewis-like twistings of the English language, some characters are written as charicatures of the timid, the pompous, and the dejected.  After all, who hasn't known their own Owls or Eeyores at some point in their life?  In my opinion, Piglet is almost the quintessential timid Englishman.  As for the original illustrations, they cannot be improved upon (especially since the movie has so invaded the public consciousness).  My advice?  Get kids to read this before they see the film (which is probably an impossible thing to desire these days).  You won't regret it and they'll take them to heart.	2004-01-02

As it stands, the book is amazingly timeless, accompanied by beautiful pen and ink drawings illustrating each and every scene.  There are plenty of details per page for kids to point out on their own and the words will not tax the average child.  The daughter of a Bohemian painter, Gag was a superb artist in her own right.

In this amusing novel, a child raised in a tourism site circa 1840, discovers that in the real world it is actually 1996 and she must find a way to save the children of the town dying of diphtheria.  Reading it, I was reminded of an old Reading Rainbow where Levar Burton visits such a town as this and enjoys his stay.  I always wanted to live in such a situation and this book captures that feeling.  Yet as it is, this isn't a grand sweeping tale.  At 184 pages it amuses and entertains while remaining true to the ideas it presents.  It is not, however, particularly stunning.  There is nothing in this book to say that it is \\"great\\" or that greatness will come of it.  Haddix likes grand ideas more than details.  The idea that the creators of this tourism site wanted to create a new race of (white) humans with the ability to withstand all forms of disease is amusing.  But the execution rings sour.  If the evil leader of this town meant to eventually phase out the adults but keep the town going, how was he planning on keeping the citizens in it?  If the tour guide gives regular showings of the children in school, why doesn't she recognize our heroine in modern dress?  Other small details such as this keep the book from being quite as fine as it might be.  Though nothing spectacular, this is a droll little read and kids that enjoy the idea of living in the past may take especially to this tale of realistic time traveling.  Extra points to Haddix for drawing influence from Conner Prairie and setting the book in Indiana.	2004-01-02

Small crimes includes little white lies and petty theft.  Large crimes represent something much larger in the grand scheme of things.  For example, it is a very large crime that it took the New York Public Library's 2003 100 Children's Books Everyone Should Know for me to discover \\"Ben's Trumpet\\".  Have you seen this book?  This is a gorgeous piece of work, particularly striking in its publication date (1979) but not dated.  Not even a little.  Following Ben, a young man living in a Harlem-esque neighborhood, the story depicts the boy's obsession with playing the trumpet.  The plot is touching and has a happy ending that doesn't feel forced or tacked on.  It flows just as smoothly as the book itself.  Nice storylines aren't what push this book into greatness, however.  Look at the illustrations a minute.  Notice Isadora's use of line.  Her clever placement of black and white.  Look at the different drawing styles that emanate from the jazz musicians and their music.  Now compare this to Ben's home, a simplistic realistic series of pictures.  My favorite section comes after the trumpeter at the Zig Zag Jazz Club compliments Ben on his trumpet playing.  The next two pages show the trumpeter walking away, his body curved, swaying to some internal music.  On the opposite page there is a kaleidoscope of forms and images, possibly representing Ben's elation at the compliment.  Possibly just serving as gorgeous filler.  Please read this to your children.  Teach this to your children.  And give this book to everyone you know.  Do I gush?  I know I do.  But trust me, this book is worth it.	2004-01-02

Any friend of Portland, Oregon is a friend of mine.  At first, \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" is a little slow going.  Beginning the book I was overeager, unfortunately, to lump LeGuin into that much scoffed at group of Tolkein wannabees.  Here we had all the makings of a different world with the usual cadre of Anglo-European mythological people and creatures.  LeGuin's talent isn't a sparkling wit or a magnificent explosion of plot.  But it has a slow burn that ever so gradually makes it so that the reader cannot help but want to know more.  Reading further, I found that my Tolkein based assumption was farther off the mark than I'd anticipated.  Here we have a world where magic is almost a science.  Unlike Harry Potter or Gandolph, when Ged (the hero of this tale) weaves a spell it requires making calculations, assumptions, and particulars about the objects he enchants.  He must know the names of the objects he is influencing.  In many ways, the spells in this book are like long written thesis.  They require research and patience.  The people also have some significant differences from those found in other tales as well.  For one thing, they're not all white.  Remember all the black people in the Lord of the Rings saga?  No?  How about Dean Thomas from Harry Potter (a character that in the original British editions was never declared black)?  With few exceptions (Nancy Farmer being the greatest exception of them all) the world of fantasy is white white white.  Unless of course you count the horridly stereotyped cannibals in Edward Eagar and E. Nesbit's fantasies, of course.  But what was never made fully clear to me until now is that the protagonist of \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" is not white.  Nor is his companion, Vetch.

So I looked her up, thinking she'd probably written a book here and there before \\"Shiloh\\" her masterpiece.  To my surprise, she is nothing less than prolific.  There were already thirty one children's books to her name by the time \\"Shiloh\\" was written, and undoubtedly many more to come afterwards (the \\"Shiloh\\" sequels alone give one pause).  The book itself is good.  Not as surprisingly good as I've found her contemporary Katherine Paterson's books to be (yay Gilly Hopkins!) but fine reading just the same.  Like many of my kind, I am not a dog book lover.  If I hear that there's a book out there somewhere about a boy and his dog, I am probably going to do whatever it takes to avoid reading said book.  In this particular case, Naylor has cleverly chosen a breed that is not only sympathetic but adorable.  Shiloh is an abused beagle.  I suspect that it is not difficult to get kids to identify with a dog that shares its pedigree with Snoopy.  What makes the book \\"Shiloh\\" itself stand out, however, is not its cutesy factor.  Many lesser books have done similar things and few have garnered Newberrys.  No, this book introduces a character that I feel is perhaps one of the most well-developed \\"villains\\" I've read.  Judd, the beagle kicker, is basically a transposed Jud from \\"Oklahoma\\" with a little more humanity built into his system.  Here we have a man who was undoubtedly abused himself as a child and who now takes this abuse out on the animals he keeps.  In time, Judd develops a grudging respect for the boy who wants to own Shiloh so very much.  The boy, Marty, is an interesting little devil himself.  Here's our protagonist; a kid willing to lie and blackmail in order to get his dog.  He lies and blackmails all in the name of that which is good and righteous, of course, but it's interesting to see such dealings from the mouth and head of an eleven-year-old boy.  Just the same, this is a worthwhile book to read.  Now admittedly, as a woman of 25 years, I'm not about to ever read this book again.  No sir.  But a book's readability and re-readability do not always have much to do with one another.  Read this book for the well drawn characters.  Stay for the cute beagle.thwhile book to read.

The cover of this book depicts the aforemention sweet Clara and her sweetheart as they run joyfully through the fields.  To freedom.  Running joyfully, mind you, away from the slave plantation in broad daylight.  I'm not saying that there weren't a couple slaves here and there who felt complete and utter joy as they ran, but this scene is positively idyllic.  Shouldn't they be afraid of getting caught?  Then again, maybe it's just representing the feeling that accompanies such flight, rather than sticking to the strict facts of the matter.<br />In any case, I began off point and I'm bound to wander off point unless I pull myself up and mosey on over the actual point.  Ahem.<br />ACTUAL POINT:  The book is quite good.  You don't see that many stories reflecting the quilts that served as maps to lead slaves to freedom.  The story is a realistic one, despite everything I said about the cover.  And the people are especially well represented.  You like Clara.  You want her to find her mother and escape off of the plantation.  The illustrations are, in pure James Ransome style, beautiful.  I've nothing more to say.  It's a book that should belong in every library's collection.  Nuff said.	2004-01-01

The characters are not only believable, but easy to empathize with.  This book is filled with short chapters that some intermediate readers will appreciate.  In this book, much of the plot hinges on the existence of Skellig (a bird man dying in a dusty garage) as well as the protagonist's dying baby sister.  Interestingly, the author is in no hurry to return to the Skellig's plot only.  A lot of time is spent by the narrator with his parents, at school, or in the hospital.<br />Introducing the character of Mina, a homeschooled little girl, the author's consistent use of the poems of William Blake works well and is never overdone.  I have known a lot of little girls just like Mina herself.  Precocious but not precious and full of interesting ideas.  Even the character of Skellig himself is beautifully rendered here.  There are plenty of children's books in which the narrator finds a pet or a person and nurtures them to health, but this one is especially interesting.  Special points to the author for never saying exactly what Skellig is.  A strong book all around.	2004-01-01

It was with the intent of learning more about this man that I approached this book.  My final appraisal is that it is difficult to determine the degree of success to which the subject is accurately portrayed.  On opening the book the viewer meets an image of Bolivar on horseback looking like a thinner, more agile, Napolean.  Yet of all the battles Bolivar fought, and there were many, there is only a single picture of Bolivar riding into battle.  Otherwise the illustrations in this book are a little dull.  They show multiple scenes of repose with people sitting and talking or writing.  This isn't to say there aren't interesting things within the story.  Simon Bolivar was a fascinating man with a rich and full life.  Yet it's almost as if the illustrator and author conspired to dull Bolivar down.  His politics, his upbringing, and his works are well displayed.  His life as a whole, however, seems toneless.  I got bored reading this book after walking in with the explicit desire of knowing more about the subject.  I don't like to think how a kid assigned this book in class would respond to it.  It might read aloud well if backed up with supplementary information and great teacher interest.  However, there aren't any endnotes at the back of the text, leaving the reader who wants to know more (and how could you not?) with just a timeline of Bolivar's \\"important dates\\".  On the whole, a disappointment.	2004-01-01

This book deserves 4 and 1/2 stars, but no such rating exists.  Just the same, \\"Sarah, Plain and Tall\\" is a short sweet story.  Some have criticized MacLachlan's unrealistic depiction of a mail order bride that has a say in whether she stays or returns to her hometown.  Arguments have been made that this depiction is not historically accurate and that women did not have such choices in the pioneer days of early America.  I am willing to point out that the book itself is a little more complex.  Though told with an adult sensibility, the primary eyes and ears of this tale are those of small children.  To them, everything depends on whether or not Sarah stays.  It is worth noting that Sarah herself never says that she is \\"deciding\\" on whether or not she is staying.  Nor does the father offer any sort of worry or concern along those lines (unless you count his initial reluctance to teach Sarah how to drive a carriage).  My own personal theory is that this idea is solely in the heads of the children.  The fact that Sarah does not immediately marry their father does throw this interpretation into a little confusion, but it's far easier to believe that Sarah \\"does things her way\\" and wants to wait a little while before marrying someone she doesn't know, rather than believe she would have any real choice in the matter.<br /><br />I have been told that boys would never voluntarily read this book on their own because it is (horrors) pink.  Furthermore, it has a girl's name in the title.  And admittedly such things would be highly suspect to most (not all) little boys.  Just the same, I believe boys will get just as much out of this story as girls would.  I recommend \\"Sarah, Plain and Tall\\" to any child that is into stories of orphan children finding a home.  Though a different reading level, it wouldn't pair badly with \\"Pictures of Hollis Woods\\" or even \\"Bud, Not Buddy\\".  Alternatively, it would also go well with homestead stories like the Little House books or \\"Caddie Woodlawn\\".  Short simple chapters make it a great read aloud tale for the younger set.

Somewhere out there, legions of ten-year-olds are chanting my name and wanting blood, but it's true.  I cannot tell a lie.  This book doesn't hold a candle to Scieszka and Lane's true children's classics like, \\"The Stinky Cheese Man\\".  It blushes in the face of their inspired \\"Math's Curse\\".  What went wrong here?  Great illustrator.  Great author.  Put them together for a children's series and you get.... mildly amusing banter and a short plot that stops before it even begins.  Oy yoy yoy, say I.  So I'm not a fan, and that's okay too.  There are plenty of amusing series books out there for people such as myself.  But what's my real objection?  Well sir, it's just not as funny as I had hoped it would be.  My expectations are too high, that's the problem.  Will this book teach kids about King Arthur?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  In any case, it's a droll little piece of fluff without much substance.	2004-01-01

In this book a small mouse sets out on a very believable mouse quest.  She wishes to find a larger food source for her family while avoiding being eaten by owls, foxes, etc.  The setting and main character are not all that different from, \\"Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH\\".  In both cases a small female mouse must fight to save other mice.  It's a simple book containing a very good sense of what courage is.  There's a lovely section in which Poppy tries to decide whether to carry on her quest or turn back, and her decision to carry on doesn't spring from some fiery belief, but the quiet acknowledgement that it is the right thing to do.  The illustrations, by the way, are charming.  Poppy is delightfully rendered as a small and charming creature.  The map at the front is also very helpful in letting the reader get their bearings.  All in all, a great book by Avi.	2004-01-01

As a child I was quite obsessed with any books that had the name \\"Betsy\\" in them.  The excellent and little known, \\"Understood Betsy\\" by Dorothy Canfield was written in 1917 and remains one of the sweetest unsentimental children's stories today.  Yet even young I consciously avoided the Betsy-Tacy books like the plague.  I was aware from an off-hand flipping through them that these were not stories I would enjoy.  They were about little girls who had rather wimpy (in my opinion then) adventures.  Where were the exciting city scenes of the \\"All-of-a-Kind-Family\\" books?  Or the beautiful descriptive passages of the \\"Little House\\" books?  I was disappointed by these books as a child, and I am afraid my opinion has changed little since growing up.  The books are maudlin and lacking in spunk.  The most gripping scene in the book is found on page five when Tacy flees from Betsy.  Spunk is not unknown to little girls in books from this time period.  Girls in the books already mentioned had it.  My beloved \\"Caddie Woodlawn\\" had it.  Heck, \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" was fairly overflowing with it.  Is this to say that every little girl in every book from the past should be spunky and wild?  Not at all.  But there must be some interest there.  Something that a girl today can read and latch onto.  Friendship is the overarching theme of this book, and it carries the story as far as it can.  Just the same, I have my doubts that any child uninitiated into this series by an earnest parent would naturally gravitate to it in the library today.  It would also not read aloud well to boys, I suspect.  I may be incorrect and as I write millions of little girls are falling in love with these stories on their own daily, but it seems a little unlikely.	2004-01-01

Which is unfair backhanded praise for a book that, in my opinion, should've been awarded the Newberry Award without question.  Sometimes I like to pretend that I'm at a party and a savvy Hollywood producer comes up to me and asks for the number one children's book that should be optioned for a movie.  Batta bing, I recommend this book.  In it, you have a well-developed plot containing characters of amazing depth.  No two-dimensional stick figures for this children's novel.  The setting is more than unique.  It is unparalleled.  Farmer's ingenuity has created a book that speaks volumes.  Not only is it an enjoyable edge-of-your-seat mystery, but there's a distinctly moral core to the book.  It's the rare story that can make a person actually enjoy a section on (believe it or not) \\"courage\\".  If your children can read, give them this book.  If your children cannot read, give them this book anyway and teach them to do so with it.  There is no higher praise I can give.	2004-01-01

How can you tell a story where these problems aren't watered down and accepted in some way?  \\"The Well\\" renders these requirements so perfectly that it's a crime and a shame that it wasn't even a Newberry Honor book.  This story plays with the reader through a million different methods.  Throughout the story the characters are fighting between pride and survival.  The boy, Hammer, refuses to react like anything less than a human being, equal to his peers in the face of antagonism.  The fact that his peers happen to be the nasty racist Simms brothers only adds gas to the flame.  Subsequently, the reader is torn.  On the one hand, it is infinitely satisfying to read about Hammer pounding the horrid Charlie Simms into pulp.  On the other hand, you can't help but feel like giving Hammer a quick slap to the face when, after finishing months of hard toil on the Simms farm for the beating Hammer gave Charlie, the book simply says, \\"Hammer made a point of going back to the Simmses' farm, found Charlie alone, and knocked him down.  Again\\".  It's a brilliant sentence with so many loaded emotions behind it you'd like to scream.  Taylor's language is adept at conveying the real horrors of the time.  Ma Rachel's tale of how her mother was whipped in an attempt to keep her child's name is an echo of the scene in the mini-series \\"Roots\\" when Kunta Kinte is told to call himself \\"Toby\\".  This book is chock full of violence and hatred.  It is, in many ways, perfect.  The author's choice of not dividing the text into chapters is particularly interesting.  Some difficulty might be had reading it aloud, if only because there are only natural stopping points.  \\"The Well\\" would pair well with other tales of intolerance, even Taylor's other books from that time period.  It is a beautiful tale.	2004-01-01

I was surprised, on reading it, at how an accurate summary of a book's plot can make it seem entirely different than the story itself.  I'm also quite glad I didn't read it prior to actually reading the book.  Not that I didn't know that the character Leslie (the tomboy that befriends the book's protagonist) was going to die.  This book was fairly well known when I was a child of the 1980s and everybody knew, without even reading it, that in it a girl dies.  In fact, for years I lay under the mistaken impression that Jesse (the story's hero) carries the body of Leslie back to Terabithia for one last time.  There's even an illustration in the book that makes it look as if this scene is taking place.  When I read the book for myself, I was shocked to find that this little piece of commonly known lore was, in fact, patently untrue.  More importantly, I found that my early perceptions of this novel as a boring and depressing novel were far off the mark.<br />The book is a good hard slog, but it has its enjoyable moments as well.  There are sweet but not overly sentimental points in the story that give the book more meaning than it might otherwise have.  I was touched by Jesse's affection for his younger sisters.  His older sisters were displayed as demons, but you can't help but notice that when Jesse isn't thinking directly about them, they show some compassion for others.  For example, they pool their money with Jesse to buy their younger sister a Barbie for Christmas.<br />Quite frankly, I liked the book almost against my will.  I can't imagine that all kids would enjoy it, but they should at least give it a chance.  The late 70s feel of it is particularly interesting, though kids probably won't get some of the older references.  This book would pair best with another tale in which a strange kid comes to town and befriends the narrator such as Kate DiCamillo's \\"The Tiger Rising\\" or, better yet, David Almond's \\"Skellig\\".g, though kids probably won't get some of the older references.

Not knowing what to expect, my husband and I read each of the four stories individually.  After finishing one we'd start over and begin with another.  Macauley should be lauded for the different modes of art he employs, if nothing else.  The watercolor illustrations of a boy on a train differ nicely from the pen and ink drawings of the two kids and their crazy parents.  Most enjoyable, perhaps, is the series of train station commuters, waiting for the train and slowly going mad.  Kids will enjoy following the escaped criminal (complete with black mask and black &amp; white striped shirt) as he runs from story to story throughout the book.  This would not read especially well to a large group of children, seeing as how the pictures are particularly small and difficult to follow from a distance.  Also some of these stories lack words altogether.  But individual children will enjoy finding new and different details in each of the four tales.  Altogether, a fascinating book.	2003-12-30

The first was how sad the book is.  As a kid I was not one of those girls who liked reading moony depressing stories all the time.  In fact, for years I was convinced that that was all that realistic fiction had to offer.  This particular book is better catagorized as science fiction or fantasy, and I had entered into it without prior knowledge of the ending.  When it did end I admitted that the book, while good, is very sad.  The other response I remember having after finishing the book was a sense of anger at Winnie's treatment of the toad.  Recall if you will Winnie's sudden desire to douse a friendly toad with the spring water that grants eternal life.  Here you have a patient creature that has done nobody any harm, and Winnie gives the toad, against its own will perhaps, everlasting existence.  The toad never asked for it, and how was Winnie's treatment of the toad any different from the treatment that the man in the yellow suit was going to give her?<br />Reading the book now, I enjoyed the descriptive elements that fill the book, making it wonderfully evocative.  The summer rain section is perhaps one of the best prose selections in children's fiction today.  The fact that the villain of the piece is referred to at all times as \\"the man in the yellow suit\\" is also very interesting.  You learn all about his life, his obsessions, and his final wish, but you never learn his name.  I'd love to know why the author chose to make the man that much more separated from the reader.  Maybe it was so that you wouldn't feel too much sympathy for him when Mae Tuck struck him down with the gun.  Speaking of which, that crime itself does seem a little unresolved.  But that's just my thoughts on the matter.<br />Mostly, I was amazed at how short the story was.  There are no lost words in this novella.  It would pair especially well with another book in which the protagonist meets an extraordinary family that causes them to reexamine their own assumptions up until that time.  Perhaps \\"Surviving the Applewhites\\".meets an extraordinary family that causes them to reexamine their own assumptions up until that time.  Perhaps \\"Surviving the Applewhites\\".	2003-12-30

Certainly the books in the series \\"The Dark Is Rising\\" are excellent, but they are often prone to long lengthy descriptions that ably bore initially interested children.  In this particular case, I suspect I skimmed long sections of this book when I grew bored of its long descriptive passages.  The books themselves are complex.  It did not surprise me that the author, Susan Cooper studied under J.R.R. Tolkien (of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; fame), and I would hasten to add that she, far more than Phillip Pullman, is his current successor.  She weaves British and Celtic myth within her stories, beautifully.  This book itself is a good one, rare in its kind because the protagonist (your typical pre-adolescent who learns of great powers) has a happy home life and two parent household.  I can think of almost no other fantasy series where this is the case.  Usually if the child DOES have two parents, one is missing and must be rescued.  Not so here.  Will has his own adventures and, at the same time, people he cares about who care for him.  In this book there is no bully to be defeated or difficulties at school.  The Dark and Light characters are well drawn and there is a depth to each and every character that I appreciate.  On the whole, I would recommend these books to those kids who are adept readers.  Definitely the child who has single-handedly finished a &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; book will zip through this series with few problems.  Harry Potter fans may also wish to graduate to a higher level with this story.  Readers may wish to start with the first book in this series, &quot;Over Sea, Under Stone&quot;, before moving on to &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot;.	2003-12-30

I've given DiCamillo a fair shot, and at this point I can safely say that \\"Because of Winn-Dixie\\" is a nice book.  I did enjoy a lot of it.  This is not to say that I didn't have problems with it.  DiCamillo, as an author, is just fascinated with the stereotypical, &quot;wise black person&quot;. In fact, the character of Gloria Dump in this book and of Willie May in \\"The Tiger Rising\\" are two sides of the same coin.  Both have illnesses (blindness and stiff joints), are old, are female, are black, and serve the ultimate purpose of helping out the white people (a fact I find rather offensive).<br />On the plus side, this book is similar to DiCamillo's \\"Tiger Rising\\" in a number of ways, not least of which is dealing with your sorrows.  And DiCamillo excels at displaying this life lesson.  She is perhaps one of the best children's writers dealing with the topic of loss, but she needs to work on her characters a little.  I've no objection to her simplified plots, because they usually fit within the context of her stories.  Moreover, this book was a welcome addition to dog related kids literature (and I can't tell you how relieved I was to find the dog didn't die at the end).  It would read well in class, and might be well paired with the slightly more complex and equally uplifting \\"Shiloh\\".  And expect a lot more children to be requesting this book soon.  After all, it's just been turned into a major motion picture.	2003-12-30

Now admittedly, the characters created for this series are not particularly new.  You can find each person's inspiration throughout other books in children's literature.  That said, these characters are rendered here in a new light, fleshed out as three-dimensional interesting people.  The great joy of this book is the imagination behind it.  Unlike most children's fantasy series, the Harry Potter books use a great deal of humor.  Few kids books in this genre can say as much.  There might be brief smatterings of it in the \\"Dark Is Rising\\", \\"His Dark Materials\\", or \\"Wrinkle in Time\\", series, but nothing to compare to \\"Harry Potter\\".  And don't even think about trying to find anything funny in the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" books.  Rowling has elevated pure enjoyment to an art form.  You care about these people, and you can identify with them.  Perhaps most importantly, Harry isn't perfect and he isn't \\"the hero\\" in the worst sense.  He has a personality and belief system, and you like him (sometimes despite yourself).  I would recommend this book (and I have) to every man, woman, and child who can string two words together on a page.  If the book has flaws, it's not particularly multi-cultural.  We are dealing with Britain, particularly Northern Britain, but Hogwarts (a supposedly international school) is very white.  An interesting side note, the character of Dean Thomas is described in the American edition of \\"Harry Potter\\" as black.  No such description exists in the original British.  Take that as you will.  Pairing this book with another introductory fantasy series, perhaps the Edward Eagar books, would be an excellent idea.	2003-12-30

Certainly I'd heard about them (I had a couple friends who wanted to \\"Boing\\" my own curls more than once) but I never found a chance or an opportunity to read them in any depth until I reached the ripe old age of 25.  Reading them now, I'm sorry I wasn't introduced to them from the start.  In this classic story Ramona is a fully realized character.  She is a little girl in full bloom.  She has good qualities and she has bad qualities, but through it all she seems incredibly \\"real\\".  Seeing things from Ramona's point of view gives you a better understanding of some of the problems she has in her daily life.  Kids will be able to relate to Ramona when she feels she's being teased and wants to feel sorry for herself.  Her anger is always understandable, and the fact that the grownups in the book are not always perfect (probably a fairly radical notion in 1968 children's literature) will appeal to all readers.  This book instantly reminded me of a book that I did read as a child,  \\"Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing\\", by Judy Blume.  Some of Ramona's less charming qualities (such as her obsessive compulsive desire to \\"Boing\\" her classmates hair) will possibly remind reads of Joey Pigza as well (though the leap from Ramona to Joey is a very large one).  This is an ideal book to read aloud to children in class or other group situations and the original illustrations by Louis Darling (if you can locate an edition containing them) are delightful.	2003-12-30

Every thought about how the futuristic society exists and operates has been meticulously figured out and recorded by the author, Lois Lowry.  There is not a word out of place in this novel.  When younger, I often got this book mixed up with the similarly titled, \\"The Cay\\".  An unfortunate mix-up when you consider that Theodore Taylor's \\"The Cay\\" is regarded by many to be a badly written pompous book.  This book, however, is lovely.  An easy read, it sets up all its ideas perfectly before knocking them down.  The reader is placed in a position not too different from that of Jonas, the protagonist.  What Jonas learns to feel about his community, we  readers learn to feel the same things at the same time.  Lowry is especially skilled at the slow reveal.  We do not know that the citizens of this world do not distinguish height or sunlight or snow or color until Jonas learns about each of these things in turn.  And the book is especially interesting when you consider that there aren't any villains beyond the system itself. This is a laudable book and a good didactic (without being preachy) tale.  This would pair well with other dystopian futures, such as \\"A Wrinkle In Time\\" (remember the world where \\"It\\" lives and the children must bounce the ball all the same way?).<br />I disagree with those readers who feel this book is inappropriate for younger readers.  While the open ended ending will probably disappoint or anger some, kids will enjoy the writing for what it is.  Eloquent and enjoyable.	2003-12-30

If Susan Cooper is the heir to Tolkien's writing, then surely Madeleine L'Engle is the successor to C.S. Lewis.  Meg, the heroine, is a perfectly rendered girl.  She is flawed and strong in all the right places, making this book a great read.  And unlike Lewis, L'Engle's Christian overtones aren't drummed into the reader.  As a result, the life lessons learned in this book are easy to carry into one's daily life.  There are some wonderful ways of depicting worlds that are \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\".  The good worlds are Meg's home or the world of the centaur-like people with wings.  Bad worlds are the land where everything is done to order and everyone must be the same.  The bad world ruled by \\"It\\" isn't unlike Jonas's world in Lois Lowry's seminal book, \\"The Giver\\".  The science in this book is realistically portrayed and would lead well into scientific discussions of the nature of the universe, tesserecting, and space.  The real danger of the book is Charles Wallace.  Meg's love for her little brother is not only believable but also beautiful.  It also makes an otherwise rather annoying character (which, sad to say, he is) likable and someone you want to root for.  I would pair this book with similar but very different fantasy story for kids.  \\"The Wee Free Men\\" by Terry Pratchett  is also the story of a girl going off to save her brother with the help of magical friends.  In both stories the heroine's anger at injustice is her saving.  The difference there is, of course, that in \\"The Wee Free Men\\", the heroine acknowledges that she doesn't much like her little brother but that he's hers and she wants him back.  No such luck with this novel, but entrancing just the same.	2003-12-30

Even without having known a thing about it, the cover of this book was familiar to me the minute I picked it up.  Though I've only seen it briefly in bookstores and libraries, Say's illustrations do not leave a person's mind readily.  Most beautiful, to my mind, are his drawings of his elderly grandfather, as well as the evocative shots of cities and mountains in the United States.  Say tackles a subject that I've rarely seen even acknowledged in children's literature.  It is the notion of forever being homesick for the other towns and cities you've grown to love in your life.  I don't know how well this can be conveyed to children.  Quite possibly, kids reading this story will understand what the author is saying on a much smaller level.  If a person explains to a kid that it is like missing school/camp/a grandparent's house when one is home and vice versa, it might be comprehensible.  This would be an excellent book for reading aloud to large groups.  Moreover, it might pair well with other stories of immigrants coming to America.	2003-12-22

The book works rather well, especially the whirligig beetle poem.  Appearing in bookstores nation wide in 1992, I remember being given this book at the age of 10 from my mother.  At that particular age I was not interested in participating in a picture book, clearly designed for younger students.  Had I received it at a younger age I think I would have liked it more.  I would recommend presenting this book to a group of students, having them perform it together.  That would be the best use of this singular text.	2003-12-22

I found this book very easy for a small child to understand, and I appreciated the theme that any kid can take to heart.  Not fitting in and the fear of not being liked by one's superior (in this case, a teacher) is a universal theme.  The fact that Maria gets saddled with an incompetent teacher from the start doesnt help matters for her anyway.  As much as Id like to rail against the idea of a teacher changing her students name because, We already have two Marias in this class, I know that there is no lack of incompetent, yet well meaning, teachers in the world whod do this very thing.  It isnt entirely clear in the story why it is that Maria doesnt discuss her problems with her parents or her teacher.  People reading this book to children should make it clear that Maria would have dealt with a lot less misery if she had simply told someone why she felt badly.  And some kids may wish for a more concrete ending than the one offered here.  Why doesnt the teacher apologize to Maria?  In any case, this book might fit in well with other stories of new kids in school.  Even the Ramona Quimby books would pair nicely, as a very different little girl dealing with school and her teacher.	2003-12-22

This book does its best to render earthquakes understandable.  To do so, it incorporates full pages of color photographs of destroyed buildings and houses.  Having been published in 1991 originally, the book may have originally served as an answer to those children wishing to know more about the notorious 1989 San Francisco quake.  I myself was 11 at the time, and curious about this bizarre force of nature.  This book does much to show a variety of different quakes from around the world, and its large graphs are very helpful as well.  Yet something about the presentation is displeasing to the eye.  Full page pictures have no border and seemingly slip off the page.  They tend to show houses destroyed by quakes without giving much thought to showing the earthquake-resistant houses being built at the time.  Also, there isn't a single footnote or credit at the end of the book.  Seymour Simon is notorious for his steadfast refusal to cite his sources in his non-fiction books.  There is no denying that this is an interesting topic.  I especially liked the informative section in the back that tells the reader how best to survive an earthquake on their own.  And this book would read well in class, though perhaps students should look at it personally themselves to better understand the graphs and maps included.  However, I urge those wanting a complete earthquake source to search out better cited non-fiction books, if they can.	2003-12-22

Though the book suffers from ending a bit abruptly, the stories are pleasant reading.  This book contains a loving family that is both realistic and great reading.  I especially enjoyed the suburban setting.  I thought the first person narrative worked especially well too.  The book reminded me a little of other \\"boys growing up\\" tales, like the \\"Soup\\" books or even Tom Sawyer.  Two thumbs up.	2003-12-22

Books	4	6	7	N	N	Revolutionary style	Fritz has the rare talent of making historical figures more than interesting.  She makes them human.  Immersing the usual boring caricatures of her subjects in the small true stories that she has discovered in their lives, she gives us an entirely different way of looking at our American heroes.  In this book, her talent for storytelling has been expertly paired with Trina Schart Hyman's intricate and intriguing pencil drawings.  Sam Adams suddenly becomes somebody you'd like to sit down and have a mug of Guinness with.  Without a doubt he is boisterous and a bit of a braggart.  But he's also a great man, and this book never looses sight of the fact that, though ridiculous at times, Adams did great things and deserves to be remembered for them.  There is little debate that Fritz's books remain some of the best historical children's biographies today.  I well remember her stories from when I was a child myself, though I half wish Hyman illustrated ALL her books.  This book would be absolutely perfect to teach to children during Revolutionary War history classes.  Pairing it with all of Fritz's books would also be an exceptionally bright idea.	2003-12-22

An in depth and fascinating look at the series of events that caused a tiny barn fire to be the root source of an enormous conflagration.  Murphy is meticulous with his sources, and he sets up the action of the fire perfectly.  Starting small, Murphy details the problems that occurred as the fire grew.  The alarms weren't called in time.  Firemen were repeatedly sent to the wrong areas to put out the fire.  The firemen were exhausted from a different fire they'd put out the night before.  The entire city of Chicago was made of wood.  People, this is an amazing book.  The personal accounts Murphy weaves in and out of the tale are harrowing and wonderfully done.  Rather than a painful history lesson, this book makes the story personal and human.  Most impressive, to my mind, is the series of chapters Murphy dedicates to the post-fire Chicago rebuilding effort.  The author wins my \\"responsible historian\\" vote by repeatedly pointing out that the rich were quick to assign blame for this fire on the poor immigrant working class.  The O'Learys (who owned the barn where it began) were eventually driven out of their own town by the nasty lies of the press.  Chicago comes off looking wonderful after the fire (the spirit of the people was so invigorating!) and the worse for wear (the classism was absolutely ridiculous).  My sole objection to this book was that we never heard a peep about the many African Americans who lived in Chicago at this time.  Surely they were just as affected by the massive fire as anyone.  Yet not a single mention is made of them.  Beautiful endnotes follow this account.  This book would be excellent read aloud to students.  It builds like a novel and draws the reader in.  Would pair well with other stories of American disaster (the Titanic for example).	2003-12-22

It is interesting to me that the photograph chosen for the cover of this book should show Lincoln without his usual beard and stovepipe hat.  I like to believe that maybe the author chose this photo himself, perhaps to make people think a little differently about Lincoln from the start.  I have nothing for praise for this biography, by the way.  The facts are interspersed with the excellent details of Lincoln's life growing up.  Freedman has the ability to mingle the times in which Abe lived his life in such a way that the readers hardly notice how well they've become acquainted with the setting before the Civil War arrives.  This book is so readable and such a good length that I can see children actually enjoying reading it on their own.  Admittedly, this may not often happen, but it's wonderful to read a book that even gives them the option.  \\"Lincoln: A Photobiography\\" would teach especially well to large groups of kids and would pair nicely with Ruby Bridges's, \\"Through My Eyes\\", giving kids a real sense of the history of African-American civil rights.	2003-12-22

For those familiar with the \\"Magic Schoolbus\\" series, Mrs. Frizzle's adventures with her class all have a similar plotline.  Mrs. Frizzle explains some scientific topic, whether it's the solar system, the dinosaurs, etc. and then lures her children onto her special schoolbus for an adventure.  During the adventure the only child that is regularly singled out as the perpetual schlamatzel is Arnold, a boy who doesn't care much for adventures, thank you.  In the end, the class is safe and has learned quite a lot, despite themselves.  Even Arnold.  Then there is a \\"letters\\" section in the back where readers wishing to complain about scientific inaccuracies (in this case, how dangerous it would be to be caught in a hurricane) are one-upped by already existing letters.  The particular plotline in this hurricane obsessed book was not too dissimilar from the others, and was a lot of fun.  I used to read these books to kids that I babysat back in my high school years, and certain types of children love them.  The pages are always busy with text, speech bubbles, experiments that kids can do at home, and various factoids sprinkled hither and yon.  I do wonder how long these series will last before it is regarded as hopelessly dated by the young.  Please note that the review previous to my own was last written in 1997.  Currently the show is doing well as a tv series, voiced by Lily Tomlin.  Just the same, it would be very difficult to read this book to a group of kids.  The books are relatively small and crammed with so much extra text that children will want to handle them one on one, rather than with a large group.  Each book would pair well with a companion non-fiction book on the same topic.	2003-12-22

I was filled with great trepidation after seeing the cover of this book.  It was a relief to me to find that, fortunately, the text was respectful and historically accurate.  But observe, as I did, this cover.  We know, after reading the book, that this picture symbolizes the rare moment when the slaves were invited into the \\"Big House\\", or home of the white slave owners, to view the Christmas trimming.  Yet it cuts too closely to the ancient inaccurate image of plantation owners and their \\"happy\\" slaves (ala Gone With the Wind) for the casual person browsing this cover.  The back cover does little to alleviate this fear, showing a scene of black children skipping merrily with a white child.  Inside, however, the authors deal deftly with the subject.  Making it very very clear that certain positive traits exhibited by the slave owners during Christmas towards their slaves were the exception and not the rule, the book gives carefully annotated scenes from the lives of white plantation owners and slaves.  The pictures accompanying the text are, most times, beautifully presented.  There is a shot of a bonfire that is one of the most impressive drawings I've ever seen of fire.  Unfortunately, some of the models for these pictures undoubtedly suffered from hair circa 1994, since it is obviously permed to perfection in a couple scenes.  Please note that the authors have a keen sense of irony that plays well.  After hearing the slaves sing a song that is code for someone escaping to freedom, the plantation owner's daughter writes in her diary that the day has ended with, \\"the sweet sound of a happy, contented slave singing a carol\\".  This point is not elaborated on, and is exquisite in its simplicity.  The endnotes found in the back of the book, annotated per page, are excellently done.  This book is a valuable part of any collection, and would read best to children a little older.  Kids who read this book on their own may not catch all the references and points that the book brings up.  This would pair well with Mildred Taylor's \\"The Well\\", as a before and after to the Civil War.uable part of any collection, and would read best to children a little older.

After reading Giblin's excellent biography of Hitler, the answer is yes.  Placing the life of this man within the context of his times, readers get a glimpse of what it was like in Germany before and during his rise to power.  Certainly I was surprised to see that in this book scant attention is given to Germany after the war.  But as this is the life and death of Hitler, not Germany, I can understand the author's choice.  Giblin is clever with his subject too.  He does not sentimentalize the dictator, nor demonize him with anything but the man's own actions and words.  After reading Russell Freedman's extraordinary biography of Lincoln (\\"Lincoln: A Photobiography\\"), I was struck with these two contrasting leaders.  Children learning their world history would do well to have these books assigned together.  Lincoln and Hitler both dealt with poverty and violence.  They led their people through two extraordinarily bloody wars.  But while Lincoln sought (in time) to defeat slavery, Hitler instated it country by country.  This book is best used as a warning to those who would seek their own glory through political power.  Perhaps this is just my own politics at work, but I was struck by how Hitler created a supposed act of terrorism as his excuse to invade Poland.  And here we are in a country that has created supposed acts of terrorism (falsified reports of weapons of mass destruction, for example) to invade Iraq.  Just a thought.  I would read sections of this book aloud to kids, though probably not the parts that refer to Hitler's sex life (or lack thereof).	2003-12-22

Macaulay recently added the title \\"Mosque\\" to his series of large constructions such as \\"Castle\\" or \\"Pyramid\\".  It is nice to see the man being so prolific.  This book would appeal to the child who likes to know exactly how things are created.  Going step by step, Macaulay explains each leg in the process of creating a castle.  More importantly, with each construction the author goes even further, explaining the purpose of that piece.  The reader never looses sight of the fact that castles were both antagonistic and defensive.  Children today that have seen the Lord of the Rings movies might be very interested in knowing more about the construction of these structures and how difficult they were to defeat.  Macaulay's drawings are just as interesting as his text.  Pencil drawings label and list every tool, brick, and worker.  Undoubtedly, this is not a book for everyone and it would not be much use beyond serving as a reference guide for interested students.  However, should a teacher wish to bring it up, they might wish to show the video Macaulay narrated of this book.  Also, it might go well with Avi's \\"Crispin: The Cross of Lead\\", as a look at a castle from a peasant's point of view.	2003-12-22

Paulsen is to many people the ideal \\"boy's\\" author.  In the stereotypical view of what boys like, Paulsen hits all the right buttons.  I don't know how true to life this reputation really is.  I don't know any young boys and, if I did, I can't really guarantee they'd enjoy this book.  Of course, I enjoyed this book.  I enjoyed it very much.  Would I have enjoyed this book if it has been crammed down my throat at an early and impressionable age?  That's an open ended question, and I like to think that the answer is yes.  This book is a lot of fun.  In this era of \\"Survivor\\" like tv shows, we the American viewing public like to think we know a lot about survival.  Bull hockey.  We know jack squat and this book sums that point up beautifully.  You're abandoned in the middle of nowhere with a single tool and you must somehow survive on your own in the wilderness.  Now.... go.  Brian does very well, but I couldn't help but think of Douglas Adams at times.  After all, in Douglas Adams' final book in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series the protagonist is dumped on a planet without so much as a hatchet.  He realizes that his only real talent is in making sandwiches (which he proceeds to do with great pomp and flair).  By comparison (and a comparison is, quite frankly, not fair) \\"Hatchet\\" is a dour novel.  This is not to say it isn't enjoyable.  And most of Brian's adventures seem utterly believable (with the possible exception of the, goodness me, tornado in his back yard).  And Brian himself is a good guy.  He seems like a quiet fellow and his actions are utterly understandable from page one.  I don't really see the point of \\"the secret\\" (nor can I understand those parents that find it so offensive in today's day and age) in the text.  I suppose it's the whole learning-to-be-a-man stuff.  Not my particular cup of tea.  For those students that suddenly have to learn about \\"Man Vs. Nature\\" (or don't they teach that in schools anymore?) here is the ultimate in such tales.  I'd pair it with Sacher's \\"Holes\\" for an interested compare and contrast session of personalities and making-do.  On the whole, \\"Hatchet\\" is a great book, and I was surprised, considering its popularity, that it only received the Newberry honor.  There is no accounting for taste.For those students that suddenly have to learn about \\"Man Vs. Nature\\" (or don't they teach that in schools anymore?) here is the ultimate in such tales.

I'm fascinated by the parental displeasure indicated in reviews of this book.  You'd think Junie B. was a small bundle of pure inexplicable evil from the way some people have reviewed her.  Undoubtedly, parents who have a problem dealing with Junie B. will also have a problem with Calvin from \\"Calvin and Hobbes\\" or any other book/comic/television show where the protagonist does not unerringly do the right thing at all times.  Some suspect that this book approves of the names Junie B. calls others, ignoring the fact that she is systematically punished for each and every misbehavior she exhibits.  Now, don't think that Junie B. is a godsend to children everywhere or the new children's classic.  But she is amusing and chock full of jokes kids won't get.  I myself have unwillingly been won over to Junie B. Jones.  Walking into this book I was convinced it was just a Ramona Quimby knock off, right down to the grade Junie B. Jones attends.  As it is, it is not only not a knock off, but an interesting series in its own right.  Junie's parents are only half as calm and collected as the Quimby's, and you can't blame them a bit.  What with a precocious kindergartner and a baby as well, these parents are fairly strained as it is.  Junie herself is realistically portrayed, and I experienced the joy many a second grader must feel when I figured out that she was going to dress up as a janitor for career day.  Here is a book that celebrates working class jobs as legitimate occupations to aspire towards.  For those students who've either run out of Ramona books, or feel they'd like to hear more about other kindergartners, Junie B. wouldn't be a bad recommendation.  Would read aloud very well in class, I think.	2003-12-22

When I was an undergraduate in college I did an art project that looked at photographs and their titles.  I was interested in the ways in which people will completely reassess their interpretation of a piece of art when they read its title.  Many times, a person will completely bypass the art itself so as to see the title and be told what to think.  In much the same way, I almost immediately flipped to the back cover of this book to read information about the author.  It was as if I had to confirm or deny my suspicions before they'd even formed.  As it happens, I was pleased to read that Joseph Bruchac was a Native American storyteller.  Would I have enjoyed this books as much as I did had I not read this?  I don't know.  In any case, the book is lovely.  The text is respectful and unhurried, choosing to develop the characters before launching into action.  It does not revert to any cliches that I could discover, and the drawings are superb.  They are sometimes dreamlike, sometimes evocative shots of people going about their lives, and sometimes tent drawings.  I know that some have complained that this book has a bit of a *gotcha* ending, and I have to admit that I agree.  It's a surprise ending that comes as no surprise at all.  Nonetheless, the story tells well and I would unequivocally recommend it for storytelling to kids.  It would pair well with other stories of great Native American heroes.	2003-12-22

The illustrations are well wrought, and the story contains some of the most evocative I've heard in a picture book. Describing Novio Boy's collar, the book says it was, &quot;a leather one with real gems that sparkled at night when cars passed in the street&quot;. The cats themselves are a twinge odd. Drawn with cat bodies but human eyes, teeth, and moustaches, they are just disturbing enough to keep the pictures interesting. It's a colorful book as well, full of beautiful swirling scenes and bold shapes. The use of Spanish throughout the text is seamless as well, never striking the reader as out of place or jarring. This book would read well with other stories that incorporate more than one language in their text. Or, kids could read it with other picture books that take place in Hispanic communities. Or, it could be paired with other stories where hungry preying animals fail to get a meal. A beautiful book to read aloud to groups.	2003-12-22

During that time, people couldn't get enough of the story of a man facing ridiculously insurmountable odds to save his men and return home from the Antarctic.  Preceeding this surge in Shackleton love, this book appeared in 1998 and tells the story perfectly.  I must admit that I fell in love with this book.  Armstrong is a master here, breaking the monotony of the months the men spent waiting for the Endurance to be free from the ice flows by telling about the crew's practical jokes and games.  The author is careful to include photographs only as they occur in the text.  At the beginning of the trip, the ship's photographer takes a great many shots of life with the crew.  Towards the end, photos are few and far between.  In some books for children, this might be a huge drawback.  Here, it works exceedingly well.  The text grows more and more interesting as the photos diminish.  I belive that if the author did not say right from the beginning that Shackleton and every single member of this crew survived, this book might be impossible to continue reading.  The notes in the back are of some help, and the photos of the crew members are useful.  What makes this book stands out is that it captures a group of people doing work that they are exceedingly good at.  It is very satisfying to read about accomplished individuals.  This book might or might not read well to children.  I don't know how well it would do.  Still, I would recommend it to anyone and pair it with books of fiction and non-fiction that deal with the Antarctic or exploration.  The fact that this book wasn't given so much as a Newberry honor is an appalling fact.	2003-12-22

On the one hand, it was magnificently depressing.  In many ways, so singularly depressing that it got to the point where I could predict exactly what was going to happen based on the first few sentences of the chapter.  The fact that the protagonist receives (I could hardly believe it) a cute little yellow duckling almost crossed the book over into absolute ridiculousness.  On the other hand, Mah assures us that this all happened.  This is no \\"Child Called It\\" with its unreliable narrator AND author.  This book is, for all intents and purposes (or so we can only believe) the truth.  And as such, it stands as a great inspiration to all children who have horrible home lives and can only escape such lives through literature such as this.  So I respect the book, even as I have my qualms.  For example, the book ends with the author receiving her father's blessing to go to college.  Such an ending feels abrupt, and I can only assume that Yah's previous book, \\"Falling Leaves\\", must pick up at that point.  Yah is an excellent writer, and here is the proof.  Though I had to physically force myself to continue reading this depressing story, at its finish I couldn't help but wonder if my library had \\"Falling Leaves\\" and, if so, if I could flip through it.  This book would be an excellent recommendation for those young adults obsessed with the aforementioned \\"Child Called It\\" (and, depressingly, there are quite a number of them).  It would not, I think, read well to kids.  This book contains acts of violence and cruelty.  I would pair it with those other true to life, or at least realistic, books that children at a certain age become fascinated with.	2003-12-22

This is a collection of poems created by inner city children in 1970.  Where once the book stood as a current shocking collection of voices, it now retains that reputation as well as serving as a useful historical document to children 24 years ago.  Reading this book I admittedly had to wonder whether or not the punctuation and lines were chosen by the kids or by compiler Nancy Larrick after they were selected.  Some are incredibly good.  Some are mediocre.  In most cases, I'd love to know what some of these kids went on to do after writing their stories in verse.  There should be a follow up book of some sort.  The photographs in this book are, according to the title page, \\"Illustrated... by Students\\".  What does that mean?  No credit or explanation accompanies these, flawing the book ever so slightly.  For those instructors trying their darndest to get kids interested in poetry, any book with the title, \\"I Heard a Scream in the Street\\" is bound to garner some interest.	2003-12-22

This threw me a little since, prior to discovering it, I had never even heard of \\"The Wheels on the Bus\\".  The book is not particularly overwhelming in any literary sense.  Anyone who has long since forgotten the words to the song will immediately remember them when confronted with scenes of children crying and their mothers hushing them.  Zelinsky has added his own little touches to each scene, showing various background storylines continuing from page to page.  In one sequence a little dog escapes its owner and chases the bus in a mad attempt to reach the kittens on board.  In another scene, the aforementioned kittens are flung hither and yon on the bus, one of them making a near escape.  Kids will love pulling the tabs and seeing everything from the window wipers \\"whooshing\\" to the mothers rolling their eyes as their babies cry.  I can't imagine the book would work after long hours of tab pulling, however.  Even for an adult, some of the pop up sections require a steady gentle hand (a thing some youngsters lack).  Still, this is a great book for large group or individual child presentations.  The sections are inventive and the song, no matter how people complain about it, is catchy.  On the whole, an inventive and enjoyable creation.	2003-12-06

With Paul Zelinsky's inventive and endlessly amusing illustrations, the book tells as well as it views.  With sentences like, \\"Varmint, I'm much obliged for that pelt you're carryin'\\", Swamp Angel's showdown with the bear Thundering Tarnation is of epic proportions.  Zelinsky has truly outdone himself in his portrayals of their fight.  There are thousands of tiny illustrations hidden on each page for kids to discover and delight in.  The fight itself is about good old-fashioned wrassling, and it's a joy to watch.  Zelinsky painted his illustrations on actual wood veneer, hoping to give the book a folk-art feel of some sort.  The result is a beautiful story that adults and kids will both enjoy.  As I might have given away, I'm a fan.  book could easily be paired with another tall tales, possibly that of the other gigantic hero Paul Bunyun or the great John Henry.  Both would fit in well with this story, though Swamp Angel owes perhaps most of her telling to Pecos Bill more than anyone else.	2003-12-06

Looking at the beautiful pen and ink drawings, comparisons to Chris Van Allsberg come immediately to mind.  Zelinsky has drawn characters that are beautifully lifelike and real.  The story itself leaves a bit to be desired.  A strong moral tale about how obsession can make a person crazy, the little boy searching frantically for the miniscule men he imagines inside a small boat eventually goes completely bonkers and rips his grandmother's beloved model ship to pieces.  He then, upon realizing that the little men will not be forthcoming, throws himself into his bed in tears.  The kindly grandmother goes to comfort him and, in an odd cliffhanger ending, she has not yet seen the damage her grandson has wrought.  Bear in mind that up until this point the self-absorbed little boy has been copping out of chores and walks by pretending to be sick so that he might catch the mini men in motion.  His grandmother has been worrying about him and tending to him all the while.  Kids will not, I suspect, enjoy the ending.  The age group for whom this book is intended will undoubtedly demand to know how the grandmother took the news that her grandson was a destructive Tasmanian-like devil in her home.  Altogether, I would not recommend this book too highly.	2003-12-06

It reminded me of nothing so much as Ray Bradbury's, \\"Dandelion Wine\\".  The evocative sights and smells of summer in a small town are rendered here in exquisite detail.  The character of the Grandmother is not only original but entirely believable.  Peck is such a talented writer that you can see the seeds of the Grandmother's personality appearing in the character of the younger sister as the years go by.  Most interestingly, the small town folk rendered here aren't made ridiculous.  While they may do things that seem silly, they're also given a dignity of their own.  The first chapter, originally published by itself as a short story, is honestly hilarious.  Too often you hear books described as \\"laugh-out-loud funny\\", but this is actually one of them.  This book also reminded me of the \\"Soup\\" book series, of which I am so fond.  This is a perfect book for group reading.  The chapters, while packed with information, are short enough to read in a single setting each.  A great book all around.	2003-12-05

Prefaced by Harry Belafonte, the book is remarkable on a number of levels.  Off the bat, it is written particularly well for small children.  The style is clear and concise without being patronizing.  Large full pictures of the people and events of the time are placed on each and every page.  While these photographs are effective, they are not violent or frightening in a visceral way.  The pictures of racists yelling at Ruby and other black children are images that stand on their own.  At the bottom of most pages are quotes from some of the major players of the time.  A quote from Ruby's mother explains that she was unaware that Ruby would be the only black child attending her school.  Another notes that standardized tests given to black children were biased in favor of white middle-class children with the hopes of failing the black.  The story has a clear linear feel to it and children reading it will recognize the characters.  Ruby herself is a remarkable child, her photographs becoming the most powerful in the book.  It is made clear to the reader that Ruby was just like any other child you might meet.  This thought is expressed more fully in the back, where a Ruby B. jump-rope rhyme has been written.  The repeated phrase \\"Ruby B., Ruby B., You were a little girl just like me\\", drills the thought home.  All in all, the book is wonderful.  I recommend it to any parent, teacher, or librarian struggling to explain the civil rights movement to their kids.	2003-12-05

With great skill the author Christopher Paul Curtis describes Bud's hardships during the worst of the Great Depression in America.  Characters are each and all delicately rendered.  Bud is a believable 10-year-old boy.  While resourceful and cunning, he is never simplified into something cute or \\"spunky\\".  For every action, Bud's responses are believable.  When Bud attempts to escape from Lefty in the man's car because he suspects he's a vampire, this is a believable response.  Some might criticize the overtly positive feelings behind this story.  Bud never suffers directly from racism in the book, though some vague references are made to it.  The violence done to him might also be considered slapstick.  But the sheer goodwill generated by this novel keeps it above these minor concerns.  \\"Bud, Not Buddy\\" is a well-rendered book.  It is excellent for presenting to large groups, though I would consider pairing it with other intelligent books that deal more directly with the Jazz age and some of the problems of the 30s.	2003-12-05

I do, I do!	A better idea in its conception than its execution.  I enjoy stories where animals speak, and this one began with great promise.  The initial tale of the mouse Despereaux is good, and it leads nicely into the story of the rat Roscuro.  Unfortunately, once the book hits the story of the servant girl Miggery Sow, it looses itself.  The Miggery Sow plotline is rather horrendous in the face of the others.  In it, a girl's mother dies, her father trades her to a man that beats her soundly day in and out, and as a result she's nearly deaf.  Once she arrives at the castle she becomes fat and beaten even more by her fellow servants.  This would be all well and good if it was done with any sympathy at all.  It is not.  The girl is stupid and scenes of her beatings are told with a disturbingly jovial tone about the, \\"clouts\\" about the ears.  There is no sympathy for the working poor in this book.  The only sympathetic lower class character, the jailor Gregor, is ceremoniously killed off without so much as a final scene.  The cook is suddenly supposed to become a likable character when she serves soup to Despereaux, the author hoping the reader will forget that not 100 pages ago she was last seen beating a 12 year-old girl.  The princess, who has grown up rich and beautiful, has no flaws.  Her father is stupid, but not evil.  In the end, this story has attempted to be about dreams and how they don't always come true.  This is all well and good, but it feels patched together.  It is almost as if the author didn't know where she was going with the plot as she wrote.  For a much better story of a young mouse learning about courage, see \\"Redwall\\" by Brian Jacques or Avi's \\"Poppy\\".  All this isn't to say I don't wish I loved it more.  I do!  But somehow I just couldn't love it as everyone else did.	2003-12-05

The book has a couple similarities to \\"The Great Gilly Hopkins\\", in terms of plot and genre.  In both cases you have a female orphan with a mind of her own who really just wants to be loved.  Hollis Woods was a well thought out character and the author had a strong sense of how a kid feels when they've been abandoned regularly.  She also understood the guilt kids feel about what they've done.  It is completely believable that Hollis wouldn't want to return to the Regans  (the loving family to whom she briefly belongs) after believing she got Steven (their son) nearly killed and is destroying the family's relationships.  She thinks she's poison to those she loves.  I haven't cried at the end of a book in a long time, but I sobbed (SOBBED I TELLS YE) with this one.  The form is a little difficult to get a handle on, initially.  I don't think this book would read aloud very well in a classroom situation.  Reading one chapter one day and another chapter the next would only confuse the kids and they would be unable to understand what happens when.  Once you understand what the author is doing, however, the book should be easy to get through.  Not for beginning readers, just the same.	2003-12-05

Zelinsky tells the story of \\"Rumpelstiltskin\\", evoking a story most American children will know.  Especially impressive is his tiny details.  A good example of this is his spinning wheel.  Many illustrated Rumpelstiltskin stories show the spinning wheel as something that Rumpelstiltskin throws straw towards, causing golden coins appear.  In this edition the spinning wheel is technically correct.  The miller's daughter is given empty bobbins, onto which Rumpelstiltskin spins golden threads.  Zelinsky's accomplished paintings show the golden bobbins gleaming, one on top of another. The portrayal of Rumpelstiltskin himself was described in one review I read as \\"Rackhamesque\\".  I don't know if this was the illustrator's intent, but he certain does seem culled from a classic European fairy tale book from the early twentieth (or even nineteenth) century.  The oil paintings look Southern European, and though a story with an odd moral (if you can outwit your opponent by cheating, you're in the clear) it is an excellent book for children.  Like its companion book, \\"Rapunzel\\", this too would be a promising book for storytelling.	2003-12-05

I've rarely read such an honest acceptance of the ways kids act at school.  Moreover, the realistic ways in which Rob, the protagonist, and Sistine, his new friend, deal with grief is fantastic.  Most characterizations were right on the money.  Though seen only briefly, I loved the portrayal of Sistine's mother.  I've met women like that.  Unfortunately, DiCamillo falls into a trap so many writers and screenwriters have fallen into before.  She has inserted \\"the magical black friend\\" found in many a modern text.  Such characters usually don't show any weaknesses (or if they do they're either vaguely eluded to or not their own fault) and serve simply as enormous founts of wisdom and patience.  While the character of Willie May does come right out and say that she is not a prophetess, she may as well be.  She's never wrong and she serves the infuriating purpose of showing the white people how to work through their emotions.  And while I like that DiCamillo even had a black person in the book, one with a little more complexity beyond serving the plot would have been nice.  The book is rather similar to \\"Bridge to Terabithia\\", in terms of a new girl opening a boy's eyes to a world of possibilities.  Recommended with reservations.	2003-12-05

Carrying many of the distinctive Zelinsky elements (staggered perspectives, reoccurring background characters, gorgeous lighting, etc.) the book is a joy to look at.  Each picture evokes the spirit of the Renaissance, from the first tableau (the husband and wife feeling her pregnant stomach in contentment) to the last (the loving family poses with the cherubim-like children).  The text is a little more racy than your average children's picture book.  Zelinsky doesn't shy away from the fact that Rapunzel is pregnant when the witch learns of her illicit relations, though he does legitimize the girl's newfound glow with a hasty \\"marriage\\" of the prince to Rapunzel in her tower.  Sans priest, no less.  The book is also remarkable for the dramatic shift that occurs in the character of the witch.  A scowling ghoul in one picture, she transforms into an almost nunlike character when receiving the little Rapunzel baby.  One might well ask what happens to the witch after she casts Rapunzel and her prince into the desert, but Zelinsky doesn't feel this is worth discussing.  A perfect book for storytelling, as the pictures are colorful and easy to see from a distance.  Would pair well with his other oil painted fairy tale \\"Rumplestiltskin\\".	2003-12-05

As evocative as her,\\"Thief Lord\\", Funke's twelve year-old Meggie lives with her kindly father Mo, a man with the ability to read books to life.  The duo face off with Capricorn, a villain Mo once read from an almost extinct book.  Funke fills her story with characters both menacing and tragic.  The pitiable jester Dustfinger, also read from Capricorn's story, wants nothing except to return to the world he loved.  Though a well thought out story, at 534 pages the book is a bit lengthy.  One could also quibble that the villain does nothing to instill the reader with real fear.  Yet children who would love to meet their favorite book friends will instantly gravitate to this new and delightful story.	2003-12-01

Christensen's biography examines Bly's life, climaxing with the worldwide trip that beat &quot;Around the World In Eighty Days' &quot; timeline. Readers of Christensen's &quot;Woody Guthrie: Poet of the People&quot;, may find themselves disappointed by this newest biography. Lacking her customary woodcuts and inventive presentation, &quot;Nellie Bly&quot; is unappealingly static. The illustrations are either taken directly from photographs of Bly or present flat expressionless characters. Christensen sticks to the facts of Bly's life, but is not above softening them. Reporting that Bly, &quot;successfully ran (her husband's) huge manufacturing company&quot;, Christensen fails to mention that Bly additionally drove the business to bankruptcy. Best used as a introductory source to Nellie's life, readers wishing to learn more about this fascinating person should consult the sources provided in the book's bibliography, notably Charles Fredeen's &quot;Nellie Bly: Daredevil Reporter&quot;.	2003-12-01

Driven by his donut lust, Sam hops on a tricycle and leaves the suburbs for the big city. Finding a fellow donut enthusiast in the form of Mr. Bikferd, Sam and his new friend begin a city wide donut search. Some parents will wish avoid a tale of strangers promising sweets (a picture of Mr. Bikferd and Sam standing in the doorway of a darkened warehouse will certainly raise concerns).

In the book, several kids discover a magnificent pheonix in a ratty old carpet.  The pheonix itself is a tart-tounged creature, often unwilling to be dragged from one adventure to another.  I highly recommend every man, woman, and child drop what you are doing immediately and read this book.	2003-07-24
