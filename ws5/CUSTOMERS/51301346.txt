I was not use to how the lead character Jada would go to Church on Sunday and have a threesomes and lots of sex acts the rest of the week.

What i liked most about reading this book was, Trisha. It is so rare to read a mainstream black novel with a main character that is determined to stay a virgin until marriage.

For the most part, I would have to agree with him. I think that if a person has the grades to get into a certain college, they should be turned down for someone with lower grades- that's just wrong anyway you look at it in my opinion. But on the other hand, that would mean that a lot of minority students wouldn't have the grades for certain colleges. I really don't know what the perfect solution would be- I know this is going to sound crazy- but maybe anybody that has has the means to pay for college should be allowed in. The students that can't hang would eventually probably drop out or flunk out and the ones that are able to keep up will. The reason i only gave this book a three was because certain parts were very boring for me.	2005-05-28

I don't understand why people think it is the responsibility of one country to make the whole world successful and happy- maybe i am slow, because I really don't see how that can be done. I think this country helps out a lot as far as food and aid in poor countries but I could be mistaken.  <br />This going to sound selfish but why should people in this country worry about how other's perceive them- you can't please everybody. If all the countries in the world were on common ground in every situation- there would still be people who will have negative things to say about the country. <br />I really enjoyed the book but a lot want because it don't have a lot of negative things about America. <br /> <br />	2005-05-20

I notice when reading these kind of books- no one ever really points out that a lot of times when black students take tests a lot of time the student will not even read the question just go down marking anything on the page instead of reading the questions. A lot of time the attitude is \\"I already know I don't know what the answer is so why should I try\\". I guess what I'm trying to say is that maybe if the student tried more on the test instead of going in thinking they were going to fail they may try harder to pass the test. <br /> <br />I always read where authors think that black students don't think it's cool to be smart. It was different at my highschool and I went to a pretty much all black school. Everyone wanted to be in the smart crowd- they thought they were better then other students, they were the teacher's pet and they always bragged about only taking honor's classes. A lot of time students that made all A's in highschool went on to fail out of college within the first semester, I don't know if it was the teacher's style of teaching in highschool or what. <br /> <br />I thought the book was interesting and made you think and try to figure out what the problem is. <br />	2005-05-07

I am not saying that agree with what went on- with Lin being in love with another womam while being married, but I understand that other cultures look at marriage different than I am use too, I thought what happen to Manna, with the attack was terrible and wish it would have been left out of the storyline. I must say that I loved Lin's brother in law's role in the book-looking out for his sister and all. This is one of the better books out there, I have already ordered more books from this author.

I asked my hundreds of relatives, both light and dark skin, and most of them said they didn't even know color was a big issue until I mention it to them. Another thing from reading this book, it makes it seem if you are light and married to a dark skin guy, he only married you because of your color, and love is not even in the equation. People always bring up the entertainment industy, to justify their point that light skin people have and advantage, but i'm thinking what's so great about that industry anyway, why not look at real life, why don't we worry more about how God see's us.

Nina didn't feel she was black enough for people because she was so light. Ahmad was a strong brotha, who was good for nina. I couldn't believe when his daugther's aunt told him that he shouldn't allow his daughter around nina because she was light. At one point I througt Nina was gonna turn out not to be black, but I was end for a shock with the ending.The author did a great job for this to be her first book.	2000-09-21

After reading the book, i found Eddie  Robinson, to be a wonderful person who cared so much for his team, and his  coaches. I felt bad for robinson when i read that a divison 1 school never  even contacted him about a job, but what I liked best of all about this  book, was he and his wife's Doris love for one another.	2000-08-26

Babysister risked her friendship with her bestfriend, over a man, and had the nerve not to try to make things right, with her friend angela, when she wanted to put everything behind them, even  though it was Babysister's fault.

I'm glad she got what she deserved.  I was hoping the book would have gave a better description of  gabrielle, and bea, i couldn't determine what race they was. Bea did a mean  thing by keeping jack and gabrielle apart.  I didn't really like felicia's  characther, especially after she had the abortion, and she know how bad her  husband wanted a child, but this was a good book.	2000-07-28
