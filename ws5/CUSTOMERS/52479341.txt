The jingling harness brasses, the warm smell of cedar, and the dim light of the brass fixtures reminded Sara Dugan of her childhood, when she'd watched Owen Dixon's grandfather make hats with care and pride. Now that the old man had passed on, Owen was the last of a rare breed: a hatter with a penchant for double-talk and an eye for the ladies.<br />Tall, lean Owen was one of the reasons Sara had left Arizona town years ago. Back then, she'd been a shy teenager with a terrible crush on Owen, the black-haired man nicknamed Devil. And despite the fact that the years had only made him look wilder and sexier, Sara focused on the business at hand---the deal she'd come to proposed. Own had been afraid to contact Sara after she'd left town. How could you tell a girl that distance was a good thing? How could you tell her that she was becoming a beauty who made your pulse race whenever she came near? But little Sara Dugan had gone off and grown up. And she was about to make a deal with the man they called DEVIL.	2003-08-25

Another wonderful addition to the Stephanie  Plum series by Janet Evanovich. It's about time that someone like TRI STAR  pictures has decided to do a Stephanie Plum movie. This series is fun, and  humble and contagious. ONE FOR THE MONEY starts it off. I can't wait until  book seven arrives.  The dog was a great addition.	2000-09-04

Uncle Fred was - - well, Uncle Fred wasn't  all that warm and cozy. Yet again, Stephanie is cast into the chaos of  bounty-hunting, boyfriends, and trying to keep her car from being  destroyed.

With respects to significant others, friends and family, this book covers a sufficient beginnings on what a victim may need for understanding. A  victim? I'll have to sign-on under that category for what happened a long  time ago.  When I was in recovery counseling, individual and group, this  book helped me to leap into higher levels of coping skills. When I was  healing, I was hunting for genuine helpful knowledge under every rock and  around every aisle.  I didn't need alphabet-soup authors who published  nonsense, empty hypothesis, trying to impress their awed students. I needed  help.<br />Linda Ledray, Dr. Ledray knows the subject matter, rape recovery.  She knows the will that we victims whisper inside--the one that wants for a  better level in life, perhaps a happy one. GO FOR IT! This book is not a  panacea. If you are a victim, there will always be more issues on your  hunt, like there was with mine. We are individuals, each experience is  different. <br />I am back today, to purchase a third copy of this book. A  young woman is going through the early stages of recovery.  She's  remembering the monsters and is plenty on the: &quot;Why me?&quot;  &quot;What did I do to...&quot;  She could use a little solid matter to  peruse. I'm just a friend. My best choice was to shut my thoughts and get  her this book. It was the best book resource among my hunt. <br />God bless  you, all and all who care. Having your personality crunched-down and your  soul invaded is not a matter to take lightly for a woman or a man or a boy  or a girl or an infant. Dr. Ledray will cover that. Maybe someday, the law  will reflect realistic trial proceedures and sentences. IN the end, God  will always know the tally.	2000-08-19

If you're browsing for curiosity, this book will work. It lightly details delivering a child, allegator wrestling and so forth.  If you're looking for a survival manual,  try PRIMITIVE WILDERNESS SKILLS: Applied and Advanced or SAS Survival  Manual. I'm back to get SAS Survival Manual, regretting that a friend paid  what he did to buy this book for me.	2000-07-04

ONE FOR THE MONEY is the first in what is now a series of six(looking at seven and eight). Janet Evanovich (I keep mispellingevanovich as evanovich--Sorry) delivers a fast moving mystery drench in comical commentary.  This author has a marvelous talent of poking fun at everyday life. I wish she had more books! <br />NOTICE: If you start reading Evanovich, you will find that you need to finish the book away from others.  You tend to chuckle. You will be drawn into the mystery of Stephanie Plum, former retailer, fumbling bounty hunter. Keep &quot;them&quot; away from your book until you finish. Trust me.<br />I'm braced to read book six coming out June 20. In the meantime, my sisters are vying for who gets to read this book third. Mom loves the series too. Since I started the series a few month ago, I've given this novel as a gift to a sister in Florida, a friend at work, and my postal carrier. That is why I say, treat yourself to this author. Enjoyment to the Max.	2000-06-17

Eve Dallas dares to step out for a social; and no matter where she she goes, Death comes knocking. This time, she's at leisure among a play audience of thousands, all witnessing the real act of murder--Witness In Death.<br />If you're a JD. Robb/Nora Robert's dedicated fan, you will love  the thorough means that Lt. Dallas  asserts her power in both her marriage  to Roarke and her responsibilities to the job. There are clever twists and  new levels of relationships--poor Peabody. Even new faces adding to the  wonderful team.<br />The dialogue between Eve and her peers is deliciously  witty. Having read all the JD. Robb novels, I'm debating between this and  NAKED IN DEATH as my favorite. Way to go, Nora!	2000-03-07

I say 'medium' for the novel sense that this great book is not a flick by flick  passage.<br />Re-reading it the second time, I savored cherishing, incredible,  carving insights. You find Hannibal, as usual, not obvious. Buy it.
