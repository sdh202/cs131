I think more educational programs ought to go this route. I mean, how do we teach kids to learn English? By propping a book in front of them and forcing them to memorize it? No, by conversactional English. THEN, do the writing. That is essentially what this CD set is doing. <br /> <br />Yes, sometimes it is hard to under Michel at first. Then, you get used to his speaking. Having actual students makes it really handy. The lack of \\"pressure\\" helps things sink in. I tried some terminology CDs and they just don't work as well. <br /> <br />If you want to learn conversational Spanish, especially if you have kids or friends that are learning Spanish, try this out (and consider the 8 CD set as well).	2005-09-19

However, it starts off really slow and might tempt you to skip it. Don't! There is a ton of information for many areas of development. I especially like having both VB and C# and their differences noted. This can be used at any level, but the more experienced reader will value the wealth of knowledge even more.	2005-09-07

Just by looking at the table of contents, you can see that a large amount of material is covered here. These are covered early, with some chapter and book commentaries towards the end. Some sections are rehashed under slightly different headings, but never to a point of boredom. It is all easy reading and can be easily read in small chunks of time. <br /> <br />I had some pet peeves (like \\"bible\\" in lowercase, which is becoming all too common). Yes, the author went a little overboard about using KJV instead of NIV (I have used most versions and prefer STUDYING with the NIV). The point that is made is that it shouldn't be easy (ala NIV), or we won't learn. By that measure, should this book have been much harder to read? Since it is not, is it a waste of time. Hardly! <br /> <br />On the flip side, there are many things that the author hits right on the money (pun intended). Like tithing. The author is absolutely right in this and that chapter alone is worth the book cost, in my opinion. <br /> <br />A similar thing that too many churches focus on is church membership and rules and regulations. So many schisms are caused by these ungodly things. Things like healing, tongues, and prophecy are covered (although the latter is way too short, but hopefully will be one of the author's next areas of deeper focus). <br /> <br />Some items are very current, like demon possession of Christians (can't happen, but influence can) and Christians losing their salvation (which also cannot happen, and I agree with the author that too many people are getting confused about this -- a bad sign for the Church). <br /> <br />There are other chapters, like fasting and why the ungodly prosper (even in the church pew, with some getting deeper coverage than others. <br /> <br />Recommended reading, especially for Christians that want to grow.	2005-08-30

I have been programming for quite a while, so some of these are old hat, but the presentation is well thought out, easy to follow, quick to learn. Just an exceptional book for this topic. <br /> <br />Not only do you get to use ADO.NET on Access, but SQL Server and/or Oracle, as well as ASP.NET and Web Services. All without breaking into a sweat. <br /> <br />I had a question about one thing and I posted on the Wrox forum for the book. The author himself responded very quickly and we got it straightened out (it was on my end, not the book). I printed out the errata, but there are few errors in the book. Just an all around excellent book. <br /> <br />p.s., oh, yeah, I bought two copies -- one for work and one for home.	2005-07-11

If you want your marketing to truly grow, check it out. No matter what size your business is or how varied your market. <br /> <br />As the author points out in the introduction, the goal is to out-think instead of out-spend. Unfortunately, that has become just another buzzword for most companies. Kinda like \\"world class\\" has become -- nearly meaningless. Not so with this book. It really has some thought provoking approaches. <br /> <br />Many of us know little facts that the book points out, like the fact that word of mouth is ten time more effective than TV or print advertising. I don't want to give too much away (read the book!), but it is not buzzmarketing if people don't want to talk about it.  <br /> <br />There were so many points that I agreed with the author. I kept nodding my head and wishing other marketers would have a clue. Like the author says \\"most people simply don't pay attention to advertising\\". How true. <br /> <br />I rarely mark in my books, at least since college, but this one got many notations in the side columns. One of the little secrets (well, it seems to be a secret) is that companies that treat their employees well often get much better buzzmarketing from their employees and their products sell better. <br /> <br />The book is easy to read and presents new information effortlessly. It passed a couple of my quick tests. One is whether I could finish it in a cross-country flight (yes). Another is whether I would WANT to finish it (yes). Another is whether I would recommend it to my friends (yes). <br /> <br />Even if you are not marketing your own wares or those of your company, this book will help you appreciate what really gets things going ... buzzmarketing.	2005-07-09

For a long time, I did not know that. When George Lucas denied any specific religious ties, I questioned it, but took him at his word. Now that I have read this book, I understand why. <br /> <br />If you read just the first couple chapters and the epilogue, you will get a large part of this text. In between, there is an amazing amount of detail on different myths. This is especially amazing since it was done over fifty years ago, before computers and the Internet. The book stays on target and has a good grasp of the religions without distorting them for the author's benefit. <br /> <br />If you are a true Star Wars fan, you MUST read this book. If you have avoided mythology, like I have, this is a good and quick glimpse of many mythologies / religions. Not light reading, but the writing is done well so that the reading is not a difficult task. Definitely recommended.	2005-07-04

With books from O'Reilly or Wiley, you can usually rest assured that it is worth your money. This one certainly is. I bought two -- one for work and one for home.

I first saw this in the doctor's office when being shown which muscles were causing a problem. The charts were impressive enough that I had to have a book of my own. I was pleasantly surprised at how affordable it was (I am used to technical books cost two, three, and four times this price). The charts are detailed, clear, and should last a long time.	2005-07-01

Personally, this is not my favorite genre. But, if you like spoofs and parodies, you should try this. Particularly if you are a Star Wars fan. Some of detail is amazing and will be appreciated by fanatics. <br /> <br />A lot of between-the-lines philosophy and politics is thrown in, obviously from the author's viewpoint, but much of it is level headed and observant. <br /> <br />This is not a book for kids, though. There are several (okay, many) sexual references that are rated R, if not NC-17. So, don't be buying it as gifts for young kids. <br /> <br />The text itself is well written and fairly easy to read. Worth giving a try. Kinda like what \\"This is Spinal Tap\\" is for the rock stars.	2005-07-01

It covers all of the important aspects in an easy-to-read format. The emphasis of the title is on \\"practical\\" and I agree. It is not some academic tome, but a practical guide of what ED is and how best to use it. It also has excellent information on how companies should handle their electronic data, so that alone is worth reading. This is bound to become more and more important as we become more paperless in the corporate world. Definitely recommended.	2005-06-30

The NUnit discussed is a free download and is very easy to start using with your own software quickly, so you can come up to speed right away and begin using it on your projects. One of the better TDD books that I have read, possibly the best. It will certainly remain on my bookshelf for some time.	2005-06-20

If you're a typical guy, like me, you would be totally lost in a ketchen. Oh, sure, you can put frozen waffles in the toaster or get the settings right to microwave a TV dinner, but that's about it. Along comes this book. <br /> <br />It presents everything in an \\"Idiot\\" fashion, which means it is informative, yet easy to read. There is a good amount of how to get started, but I would still have liked more help (hint, hint). There are plenty of recipes, but not too many, from a wide variety of styles, foods, and situations. <br /> <br />There is even a decent guide to selecting wines, which I do know something about. While the list of vineries is good, the list of specific vintage wines should have been excluded (it dates the book before it is published and many of the wines, even \\"popular\\" ones, are hard to find for most people). <br /> <br />Overall, a good idea for a gift -- especially for birthdays of Father's Day!	2005-05-24

In fact, if it were a commercial product, this should be even more widely distributed because it does a convincing job of showing why alternatives to Internet Explorer are necessary. <br /> <br />Of course, being an O'Reilly book, you can count on it have good substance. This book does. It also is easy to read. The first part gives an excellent history of the Internet and browsers (I remember those days!). Unfortunately, instead of highlighting why Firefox is needed, it points out many of the pitfalls of IE and then just jumps in with here-is-Firefox. Sure, some of the blanks can be filled in, but it would have been helpful if the book did that more directly. <br /> <br />The how-to-use sections are straight forward and have many helpful screenshots. The section on other alternatives to IE (Camino, Opera, Konqueror, Safari, OmniWeb, and Lynx) is very good and open minded. There are many helpful tips and watchful gotchas pointed out. Definitely a good book for the subject.	2005-05-24

This book lives up to those expectations. <br /> <br />Yes, the production quality is top notch and the two color printing helps make things even more clear and accessible. The paper and binding are nice, too. The size is very comfortable, easy to hold in your hands and not too thick (certainly not a 1500 page 3 ton tome). <br /> <br />So, the important stuff, the content? Great! Firefox is quickly becoming a standard fixture and for good reason. This book will help solidify that. <br /> <br />An amazing number of nice \\"hacks\\" that will help you.

Kinda like an instructor saying \\"now, kids, this is what I mean by that.\\" Even for people without experience in those fields, it came off as a little too preachy. <br /> <br />However, the story is very good and loses that style fairly quickly (maybe the author took a break?). It keeps you reading and wondering what will happen. All the way to the end. About halfway through, I thought of something. But, the author drew me away from that ... until the surprise ending. Very good.	2005-04-13

Besides being easy to read and well organized, it has a wealth of relevant information. <br /> <br />There are six parts: 1) what makes New England's weather and climate unique; 2) causes of change in New England's weather and climate; 3) diversity of New England's weather and climate -- from the mountains to the beaches; 4) seasons of New England; 5) the weather events that influence the lives of New Englanders; and 6) changes over time. <br /> <br />Each part shows both the experience and research of the author.

Otherwise, it could be a dry book. The book is more for the application of verification than it is for analyzing past experience of weather verification. For example, I know many weather forecasters that I cannot trust their 24-hour forecast, let alone the 10-day ones they project. I highly doubt that they have applied any of these verification techniques to their forecasts. That kind of historical perspective is not in this book, but if you want to improve your own forecasts, this book will get you started in a sound direction.	2005-03-06

Too often, these types of books turn into little more than political rants. This is not the case here. Sure, there are political actions and inactions that are discussed, but no personal attacks. <br /> <br />There is not a tremendous amount of scientific data in this book, but I did not expect it. I was not looking for a tome of information. The author delivers on her personal and professional experiences in what is the best way possible. If only we could get others to follow her lead.	2005-02-25

That said, it is probably not for someone who is not really interested in weather forecasting as a serious hobby or profession. There is a wealth of information and it is organized very well. It is something that you will certainly want to pick up many times as your knowledge grows about this subject. <br /> <br />The appendix has a good amount of information that will further research. At the end are a bunch of analysis charts so that you can apply your knowledge. This would also be suitable as college material and each chapter has some questions to reinforce the learning of the material.	2005-02-23

It was expensive (aren't all college textbooks?), but worth it. <br /> <br />As a beginning weather hobbyist with a new weather station, I have been looking at many weather books over the past couple months. I have been disappointed. Most seem geared to elementary school levels. A couple handfuls are for the general population, a few intermediate, and a couple handfuls are for more advanced hobbyists or professionals. <br /> <br />This book was one of the very few that I would strongly recommend. The information is great and presented very well. It is colorful and slick (yes, substance is more important than slickness, but this book has both). <br /> <br />I found the CD less than useful, so I tried it and removed it. You won't be missing anything, really. The book has it all. Just a great book.	2005-02-23

The photos are a wide variety and large. Some of them are slightly grainy, but not cheesy. Many of them are merely described as \\"clouds\\" instead of their classification, but the variety is what is significant for this volume. Not a must-have for meteorologists, but good book for weather hobbyists and certainly good for the coffee table.	2005-02-15

This is one that is and has a lot of good information. It is in a question and answer format, but is informative and very quick to read. Definitely recommended for all your questions related to weather.	2005-02-07

After perusing it, I changed my mind and bought a copy for myself. It has a lot of weather stuff and a good amount of different clouds and material on lightning. It is the traditional Audubon format (plates in the middle and text in the first and last sections of the book). Good enough for my dough.	2005-02-04

However, the author is making it TOO personal. Sure, each of us has our own perspective and is free to write it, but it is overwhelming. It is the kind of thing where the arguments are right on, but the presentation ruins it. If some of the harshness had been filtered, it could have received five stars because it highlights things that most people do not know.	2005-02-03

Not only did I learn several things, it was entertaining while learning. The author covers a LOT of proverbs, even though maybe half get lumped into a small area after the meatier ones are covered. A must read for people interested in weather.	2005-02-03

Not quite as spine tingling as \\"Timeline\\", \\"Sphere\\", or \\"Andromeda Strain\\", but the docu-drama approach is well worth it. The references are excellent as are the appendix and summary. It could have been trimmed down some, but I like it just the way it is. I think it is great that Michael Crichton went out of his way to research this. But, that's what I have come to expect from him. Excellent book.	2005-02-03

It is also good for those who do not have to do that, but want to know the differences. <br /> <br />Granted, much of the .NET platform allows almost line-for-line conversion between languages, but there are many syntax differences. This book covers those for these two languages, as well as a special section of significant differences between the languages (in addition to the item-by-item coverage). <br /> <br />This is a handy little book, but because it is little, it sometimes slides to the back of the bookshelf (between two larger books). Still, well worth the price and peace of mind.	2005-01-07

It has all the essentials (eating, sleeping, travels), but also has those little insights about when and where and why. It is small in size (not like some other \\"small\\" books that are three inches thick), easy to read, and certain to be useful.	2005-01-01

The UN is becoming a serious detriment to democracies around the globe. Hopefully something will be done before it gets a stronger foothold. <br /> <br />Although the UN has been helpful in the past (and not just always on the US side of things), it now has become a group hangout for awful leadership of questionable countries. We, the US, should not be wasting our money on it. If it is such a great thing, let those \\"other\\" countries pay for it. It is NOT helping world peace. <br /> <br />The author points out Clinton's errors and rightfully so. However, near the end of Clinton's last term, he was getting a change of heart. In fact, if I recall correctly, he also was calling for downgrading or eliminating the UN. I agree. Unfortunately, many of his followers do not (so much for the \\"political genius\\", eh). <br /> <br />This was a good read. Try it.	2004-12-24

However, it was very disappointing. I then checked out the Idiot's Guide title.

Definitely recommended for people wanting to get started in drumming.	2004-12-24

I wish this had been around when I started playing (about 30 years ago). It would have been helpful for both me and my parents. <br /> <br />It does not cover how to play chess, which is good. Seems like every other starter book insists on it. It would be inappropriate in a book like this, so I was glad to not have to skim through that again. <br /> <br />The book does an excellent job of covering all the other aspects of playing chess: learning, clubs, tournaments, Internet, competition, etc. <br /> <br />Excellent choice.	2004-12-16

It stems from the Christian Reformed Church (CRC), but can easily be used in almost any presbyterian evangelical type church. It is solid doctrine and is excellent for any church in almost any situation. It is especially helpful for churches considering expanding to multiple services and/or having services of different \\"styles\\". Highly recommended.	2004-12-15

Although I use C# and C++, I primarily use VB.NET. The book is in C#, but it is easy to read, as you might expect. You might have heard the author on DotNetRocks. If so, you probably already expect a lot from this book. So far, I have been impressed. It is a book I plan to keep and refer to occasionally. By contrast, there are so many that I buy, read, and then shelve and never use again. Look at the table of contents and enjoy.	2004-12-15

It was much lighter in weight than my other Constitution and Supreme Court readings, but was even more lightweight than I expected. Although the first couple sections are good, it quickly gets lost and seems to be more a collection of short notes rather than a worked-out essay. The printing is good, but the binding is less well done, and it could have used some more typograhical reviews. Overall, not bad, just not what I had hoped.	2004-12-12

Puzzles are used less often, for several reasons. One of the reasons, which the book starts with and then gets stuck, is that it is the journey of trying to solve seemingly impossible problems. Unfortunately, with more people memorizing all the puzzles, MS and others are switching gears. So, if you want some of the problems, with solutions, this might be the book for you. If you want a job at MS, I would suggest visiting MSDN at the MS site and look around.	2004-11-20

Certainly, it is not the only one on my shelf, but it would do well on a deserted island (where a social life doesn't matter). It covers a wide range of topic areas and covers them well. It is not terse, but it still can be easy to gloss over important items. Big and heavy, but opens flat so that it is easy to place in front of your monitor as you read along and try out the topics. Excellent.    Edit: now that I have gone through another dozen or so VB.NET books, this is the ONE book that I would keep on a deserted island.	2004-11-05

It is also good preparation if you think you might be laid off (or quit your job). The first part of the book is great and is right on target, showing that the author knows what he is talking about. Although the resume writing part is small and boring for those of us who keep our resumes updated, it is definitely good for people who have not updated theirs in years. Overall a very good book and an easy read.	2004-10-22

A year or so I started to get a new appreciation for comics after reading \\"Understanding Comics\\". Lately, I have read many graphic novels. I find that fictionalized non-fiction work best for me. Of course, \\"Maus\\" is a classic. This book \\"Blankets\\" is sure to join it on the classics shelf. The author is incredibly open. I felt like I was reliving my own childhood. Definitely a worthwhile read.	2004-10-20

I looked briefly at \\"Reinventing Comics\\" and was underwhelmed (at first glance). A year or so later I picked it up again and read it. It is more impressive than I first thought and I could not recall why I had not continued onto it. Yes, it is different than the first book. It addresses what the title states, how to take the comics industry into the future. Very good ideas and good dissecting.	2004-10-17

However, it is still viable in all those methods and certainly will help the user get a better grasp on estimates, even if the full blown function point analysis (FPA) is not used. There are many examples that help the reader see how to implement FPA. I got this book soon after publication and it still retains a prominent spot on my bookshelf, well after many others have come and gone.	2004-10-01

Yes, you have to be able to play MP3 files (or convert them to audio files), but you get a very handy carrying case and only seven (7) CDs -- hard to believe that would include the whole Bible in NIV translation. <br /> <br />When I first listened to Max McLean on the cassette version, several years ago, I was thrilled. I was worried about the quality when going from audio to MP3. Now, I have transferred many sermons from CD quality to MP3, so I also knew that it can be done well and still save a lot of space. These CDs do just that -- great audio on one-tenth the number of CDs. <br /> <br />The audio chapters are short and make it easy to skip around. The reading is dynamic, articulated and dynamic. Just all around great.	2004-09-29

If you are familiar with \\"UNIX Network Programming\\" (Stevens, Fenner, and Rudoff) and \\"Advance Programming in the UNIX Environment\\" (Stevens), then you will be comfortable with this volume. All of them contain excellent documentation and good examples, as well as a nice clean format. Although catering to Solaris, much of it is applicable to other UNIX environments as well. If you use Solaris, you will want this book. <br /> <br />The text is clear and easy to read, making things easy to find and use, thereby making you more productive. There are 1200+ pages, but you wouldn't think so. The paper is thin, but durable (a sign of quality publishing) and fits in with other professional publications. <br /> <br />This book really has a ton of stuff in it. From specific 64-bit programming topics to library function documentation to secure programming. The sections on I/O are extensive and detailed -- there could be more information on network programming (the author also refers the reader to the same \\"UNIX Network Programming\\" that I mentioned, so that is a good sign). However interprocess communications is covered very well (e.g., pipes, FIFOs, message queues, semaphores, and shared memory). <br /> <br />The appendices have some useful information. In addition to a function summary, the section on internationalization is good and surprisingly forward-looking. The exercises make it useful as a classroom text / reference as well. <br /> <br />This book already can replace several books on my shelf. Just an amazing book for your reference.	2004-09-22

However, for an actual (potential) expert witness, it is rather weak. The advice is all good, but too generic to be very useful. It is a very short book, which makes it an extremely quick read.

I nearly gave it four stars (see following), but it does many things well. Some may knock the book because it has few bells and whistles (i.e., gear and gizmos). However, anyone that has run for a long time will tell you most of the same things that this book does. <br /> <br />I was slightly disappointed that all the photos were \\"eye pleasing\\". Looks more like a magazine of female models for TV spots than the typical healthy runner. In some ways, I prefer the old style of James Fixx in the original \\"Complete Book of Running\\" (not Runner's World). <br /> <br />There are almost no shoes shown, which is the most important of equipment. This is good. What is shown is the proper way to size your shoes and reinforcing that a runner should stick with what works for that runner and not chase after fads. <br /> <br />The nutritional and healthy lifestyle information is excellent. There are things that a more advanced runner may want to see, but this is an excellent start.	2004-09-09

This new edition covers Internet and other electronic references and has extensive examples of many different sources. The grammar section, although somewhat new, is weak. I still keep my \\"Grammatically Correct\\" handy, but that and the CMoS have replaced my \\"Random House Handbook\\". Definitely a book to keep handy for those needing to make professional publications of any type.	2004-09-02

Yes, of the 400 pages, \\"only\\" 230 are the main text and 140 pages are model reports. I would have bought the book just for the main text. The model reports are worthy extras. Not to mention the 20 pages of \\"advice from the trenches\\". <br /> <br />By the way, the model reports are not merely medical. At first glance it might appear that way, but reading the material shows that it is not. Here is a list of the model reports: <br />+ toxic tort <br />+ medical negligence <br />+ correctional facility safety evaluation <br />+ products liability, rule 26 <br />+ biomechanics <br />+ vocational evaluation <br />+ legal malpractice affidavit <br />+ independent medical evaluation <br />+ products liability <br />+ trade secret declaration <br />+ accident reconstruction <br />+ custody / visitation evaluation <br /> <br />If you write expert reports regularly, this should be on your bookshelf. Even if it is your first report, definitely consider this book. It will, more likely than not, remain on my shelves for quite some time.	2004-09-01

I skipped around but read the whole book and highly recommend that you do, too. It might be tempting to skip a chapter or two, depending on your needs, but reconsider and read them all. This was very helpful in many areas of expert witness, both research and testifying.	2004-08-24

Too often Christians are blamed for \\"failures\\" that are beyond their control. This book helps to see how bad things fit into God's plans. Very easy reading and worth passing on to friends in time of need.	2004-08-12

The pictures are very good. The intro is required reading and is about all the reading that has to be done. Then, just jump around to the sections you need to work on.	2004-06-25

Like on the show, if someone does not under Simon or his role, he may come off as being conceited, which Simon implies may be true. I don't see it that way. I know many people similar to Simon who really are conceited, but they deny it. Not surprising. I pretty Simon to those phonies.<br />I have liked Simon on &quot;American Idol&quot; for a long time. His book is very similar. You get to see how he got started and what went into his decisions. You can understand WHY he made some choices that he did. Overall, a very good book and easy reading.	2004-05-30

It brought up many behind-the-scenes things that you rarely see or read about. Best of all, it was done without a lot of flair or exaggeration (too many books lately are swinging for the fences with how they can make things larger than life). The author remains fairly objective and writes in a style that is informative and easy to read. Put it on your list.	2004-05-27

Sure enought, there is. My second thought was if it would be up to the excellent standards of most of the other &quot;for Dummies&quot; books. It was. This book has a lot. My wife had to go to a four-day program to be informed about diabetes and how to live with it. This book contains a surprising amount of the same material. It got me up to speed at almost the rate she was. Impressive. If you want to know about diabetes, get this book.	2004-05-25

The physical exercises are good, especially for older farts like myself! The book is brief, but the clear photos will get you off to a good start quick. This was my first experience with a publish-on-demand book and I was really impressed with the quality. Good stuff. See you on the field!	2004-05-18

Not a hallmark like his early books, but a better book than some of the author's more recent efforts. Unfortunately, Woodward has been turning from a report-the-facts-and-let-the-chips-fall-where-they-may into more of a political agenda, offering or delaying information if it suits his agenda (he more or less hints at this in this book as well).<br />Overall, there is a lot of good information about leading up to this Iraq war. The Epilogue also contains some pertinent and current information that should not be skipped.<br />One disturbing paragraph was at the start of chapter two (and already being cited in the press). This claims that Bush knew about the 9/11 attack before hand. It appears that the substantiation will come later, but it never does. The author even admits that the \\"evidence\\" was questionable, not direct and probably would have made no difference. Why, then, the paragraph that is sure to be inflammatory? Again, a political agenda rearing its ugly head.<br />Some say that this book is damning for Bush. Upon reading it, I clearly think that it is not. In fact, it shows a concerned President who gathers information and leads with his decisions (and NOT a puppet of Cheney, as some would say).<br />The book does show the wavering of Powell, that anyone could see between-the-lines in the news. However, Powell as well as Hillary Clinton and others still have the conclusion that it was the \\"right\\" thing to do, with or without evidence of WMD. The book also shows how certain and adamant Tenet was about WMD. It also shows the duplicity of Kerry and hints at why he might not be trustworthy, as all of his military superiors have also said.<br />There are a host of other enlightening tidbits, so it is worth reading and is fairly easy reading at that. The best thing that I liked about the book was the hint that Woodward is heading back in the direction of more objective reporting.	2004-05-07

No, it does not get all Zen on you, but it does help get into a better and more competitive mindset. It helps in your day-to-day competitions and in your team strategy. The drills are very good, even though they get a bit long. The photos are good, even though there might be too many photos of stretching. On stretching, make sure you do not over-stretch -- you can do more harm than good. There are some typos and such, but the content is worth five stars.	2004-04-23

The writing does an excellent job of getting to know the sniper. There is a fair amount of jumping around in time, but it never leaves the reader lost. It seems to lose some consistency when Hathcock comes home the first time, almost as if there was a change in authors (perhaps it was done at a later time). Still, definitely a book worth reading.	2004-04-22

Although most of the experiences were woodsball, a lot of it applies to speedball as well. Easy to read, despite a few grammatical and typographical errors. Definitely reinforces the idea that many paintball players are &quot;average&quot; and not a bunch of loons. Fun reading.	2004-04-15

I really like the author's book &quot;The Weekend Warrior&quot;. That probably helped set my expectations high. I liked that the book is broken into sections based on team size (on both sides). Some of the ideas are creative, but I was disappointed to not see some standard games (e.g., defend-the-castle). Not bad, possibly something refs should look at for ideas for woodsball when everyone is tired of elimination or capture-the-flag.	2004-04-11

Other than a few things that are out of date (e.g., charging is less effective now with semi-automatic markets than it was then with pumps), everything else is current and excellent advice for paintballers. Certainly worth the price of a couple hundred paintballs, for sure. Make sure to read this one and pass it on to your team.	2004-04-10

It lets experts guide the beginner through a great way to get started. More advanced players may be bored with the slower pace, but beginners will enjoy it and welcome some of the repetition. The title &quot;Ultimate&quot; does not mean &quot;Complete&quot;. For that, I would get the &quot;Complete Guide to Paintball&quot; (2nd edition). Or, do what I did and get both.	2004-03-30

For horologists, there is a fair amount of movements shown, with many of them &quot;exploded&quot; to show all of their parts. For historians, there is a lot of good old-time advertising and photos. For collectors, of course, you get to see a whole bunch of the product line back over a hundred years ago. The price list is minimal and ten years out of date, so it is not as relevant, but not completely useless either. Still, not a bad offering.	2004-03-24

Only about three of the pools would be useful for 90% of the inground pools that might be built. Not even very many good ideas that are not already known by most anyone who has seen pools in magazines. Most would take a full-time pool employee to maintain.

Now, there were some things that I disagree with, as well as other &quot;expert&quot; developers, but overall the tips and traps were right on. So, this is a book that you should read if you are building a hime, but also read at least one other good book. Because of some of those things that were too specific (i.e., not mentioning other reasonable options), I nearly gave it four stars. However, it is worth reading and normally would warrant the five stars.	2004-03-15

I read this book when I first contracting about five years ago (I thought I had already reviewed it, but my review does not show up).

I read (at least) a book a week, but over 95% of those are non-fiction. My wife tries to get me to read fiction, but usually fails (hard for anything to come close to my \\"Lord of the Rings\\" type of standard). My son, however, had an excellent idea -- he started a family bookclub where he chose a book for each of us to read and report on in three weeks. This was the book that he chose for me, which I read in a few days.<br />The plot and characters are creative. I never \\"knew\\" so much about fairies! While it was easy reading, I got to know the characters. There was good flow, but still good transitions without appearing choppy. The printing was easy on the eyes and the book was comfortable to hold (which a surprising number of publishers seem to ignore). Definitely recommended for kids 10-15 and also for kids older than that!	2004-03-10

The part of the title that says &quot;build your own home&quot; is misleading -- it does not mean it shows YOU how to build your home, it means it in the general sense of whether people will buy a pre-owned or build-your-own-home. I was fine with that because that is exactly what I was looking for.<br />I spend a half hour poring over a wide selection of similar books. This one looked best. I spent another ten minutes on it before selecting it as the best. I was looking for specific tidbits that I know that I would give other home builders. After reading the book, I was even more impressed. There is a tremendous amount of good advice in an easy-to-read format. Highly recommended.	2004-03-07

It is very easy to read, probably more so than some of the others. The sections on law and history are very interesting. The section on women was not quite as interesting, but that was to be expected (focusing on a special interest as opposed to the broader scope of the court). The explanations of how the Court works is very good and something about which the public is often wrong. Overall, a good Supreme Court book.	2004-03-04

It has an excellent description of the major dials and movements with nice large pictures. The information is detailed, in-depth and informative. A professional book. It is large format, not too thick, but the glossy pages (which is a good thing) make it heavy. For the collector / repairer of chronographs, this is a must-have book.	2004-02-28

It provides a lot of detail and good photos of all the major brands (the competing buying guides leave out some significant brands). Well done and worth buying BEFORE you spend 30 times its price (or more!) on a watch. See the different styles and open your eyes. Take the TIME to appreciate it!	2004-02-22

The book is very easy to read and is entertaining. Not to mention that it touches the news headlines that we read and may have glossed over at times.<br />There is no silver bullet, but the book does offer some good suggestions. It is amazing at how predictable and how low human behavior can be. We are rarely surprised, in hindsight, but reading this book within five years of the event is rather illuminating.<br />The notes are extensive (30 pages), but informative. The binding and printing are very good. Overall, a very good book.	2004-02-21

There is some very good stuff here, but it is moderated by some softness that is not entirely biblical (e.g., church discipline) -- not that it is wrong, only that it tells half the story, the half which is more &quot;politically correct&quot;. Although that should not be the overriding factor, I fear that many people use books like this more as &quot;gospel&quot; than the actual &quot;Gospel&quot; (i.e., the Bible). It happens all the time.<br />The book is easy to read. The writing is smooth and printed in a fashion that is easy on the eyes. The insertion of tidbits is tasteful and not overdone. The notes are well organized. The splitting into 40 sections (one-per-day) is reasonable and flows well. The advice is very good and the scripture references are plentiful, from a variety of translations, and are very helpful.<br />Overall, definitely a good Christian book to read this year. Give it a try.	2004-02-13

The first half reads fairly quickly and provides interesting perspectives from both sides of the fence. It is apparent that the author has both a theological and scientifically-aware background. At the end are some sample sermons which may be especially good for ministers. Recommended.	2004-02-10

I am not a teacher (but may be someday!), being a software engineer by trade, but my personal experience has led me to many of the same conclusions. Standardized testing is not really helping our students. There is quite a bit of substantiation for that claim, including the extensive references and coverage in this book. Too often we get students who are test-smart (not necessarily even book-smart), but are not independent or creative things. This book points out many of the problems and how we can take small steps to make a big and needed change.	2004-02-06

There is no need for scare tactics because it is a very real situation and one that is very likely to occur unless we change things (which is not looking too promising at the moment). Fortunately, and timely, last night's episode of &quot;The West Wing&quot; addressed the very same issues and hopefully will get people to start thinking about it, if only at a subconscious level.<br />The author is a Democrat, but does a good job of keeping things on the level (except for the several times that he complains about the problems that Clinton &quot;inherited&quot;, while ignoring the ones that other Presidents have &quot;inherited&quot;, like a trashed stock market and rapidly tanking economy). A bit more editing would have been much better. Still, open-minded individuals can appreciate it (by the way, I am Libertarian).<br />There are no easy solutions, but this one gives some good possibilities that could be acceptable from all sides.	2004-02-06

I expected more political bias, especially considering the environment the past couple years, but it was refreshingly free of that. In a few areas where controversial things were discussed, it was handled in a level-headed manner.<br />This is an easy way to get a bird's-eye view of political coverage over the past 40 years. Very refreshing.	2004-01-30

Although I now do my taxes electronically, I still get a &quot;real&quot; guide as both a reference and tutorial. It also makes for an easy way to see the big changes for the year. This guide has all kinds of information with very good detail and examples. The printing is easy to read and the quality is good.

I was not surprised, because I had listed to his unabridged version of Lord of the Rings before this. My expectations were high and I was not let down.<br />The various voices are very well done and consistent. The voices of the animals (dragon, thrush, raven) are especially well done. The enunciation is very clear and the noise level is very low (i.e., a high quality recording).<br />Having short (e.g., three-minute) tracks is really helpful. The packaging is very good. All around a very professional package.	2004-01-20

Not necessarily expertise, just a decent interest in it.<br />The reading is easy. The presentation is great, as I have come to expect from the publisher (Wiley).<br />The content is very good. Note that these are from applied mathematics rather than pure mathematics. The author also makes this clear in the preface. This is an approach that I (sometimes) prefer, but just be forewarned that it is not the best of both worlds. Each topic is well explained and has many modern-day examples (e.g., Cuban Missile Crisis) worked into the text, making it all the more interesting.<br />Good reading and recommended.	2004-01-14

Being a smallish book and a smaller audience, it is understandable that the mathematical details are trimmed down (almost excised, you might say). Still, there is too much history and not enough details. Too often the author says that it may be above the reader's level. Overall, I was disappointed, but it was not a waste.	2004-01-11

However, the tips on how to improve your basketball play were worth five stars, so I averaged the two. It is not quite up to the caliber of other &quot;for Dummies&quot; books, but it is worth a read.	2003-12-17

When I first heard that there was a new edition, I was afraid that the classic would be destroyed. Although it is quite different and much of it has been done by &quot;et al&quot;, it turns out to be quite good.<br />Initially I did a quick scan and immediately saw some things missing (like FTP). However, after reading the book and realizing how infrequently I had referenced the missing parts in the first book, I was much happier. With the additional IPv6 information and newer technologies, this more than made up for the deletions (from volume one).<br />The text is easy to read and flows logically. What really impressed me was the depth of the expertise. For me, there had been some stumbling blocks in TCP and UDP development early on (especially nuances of UDP) that took a fair amount of time to figure out. I was pleasantly surprised to see many of those difficulties laid out cleanly for anyone to figure out in a matter of minutes. That alone is worth the price of the book.<br />The index is extensive and helpful. The questions at the end of each chapter are limited, but enough to be useful in a college course.<br />The printing is high quality. The paper is high quality (thin, but strong so that the 1000 page book is not huge or heavy). The printing takes up much of the page (i.e., not two-inch borders like some books). The binding lies flat without separating the pages. Definitely a quality printing.<br />Yes, a new classic.	2003-12-16

It answered many of the questions that I might have raised about the subject. It does so in an informed and easy-to-read manner. It is not stuffed with references (both pro and con). Much of the medical science is filtered so that the person-on-the-street will understand it. Many sidebars answer some basic questions. The headings are brief and accurate, making it easy to skim and find answers to questions. Overall, a worthwhile reading. Recommended.	2003-12-05

In fact, many of the most &quot;logical&quot; people in history HAVE believed in an after-life. Go figure.<br />As you might guess, I disagree with the author. HOWEVER, I make it a habit to read works of those who disagree with me. When I read a logical, informed, balanced viewpoint that I disagree with, I can respect it (even if I still disagree). This particular book, though, is none of those.<br />The author's expertise apparently is in comparitive English, but he seems to miss the point completely of many of the referenced works. Some of the references made to Bible excerpts are taken out of concept and abused (typical straw-man argument).<br />My biggest disappointment was the treatment of Emily Dickinson. She is my favorite poet and I have read all of her poems (in fact, I manually typed ALL of them for archiving) and done studies on many of them (in specialized college courses and such). Now, the author is nearly right when discussing Emily's beliefs. But his selection was poor and not wholly representative of her poems or her life.<br />The whole book seems to be a push for &quot;my viewpoint is right&quot;, which is somewhat to be expected from its title and cover. However, the author adds little or no substance, making this a disappointing read.	2003-12-05

To make sure that previous experience was not biasing my opinion (too much), I got four issues that were out at the same time. The magazines are Transworld Skateboarding (TS), Thrasher Magazine (TM), Skateboarder (SM) and SBC Skateboard (SS).<br />For photography, TS probably takes the lead. For the skateboard lifestyle, the edge goes to TM. For those who like to read text, SM has the most. Surprisingly, the best is probably SS, which is a balanced combination of all three styles.<br />Before spending too much on any one magazine, I suggest you try the same so that you get THE magazine you want.	2003-11-22

My expectations were high, possibly too high, but this was a decent book. Yes, some of the theology is light, but many of the text exegesis are right on target. There are three pages of comments for each of the 59 verses, which a good variety of detail without making it overly complicated. A good read.	2003-11-22

You are given good card / deck intros and strategies. You are given a list of cards with their attributes and descriptions.<br />All of it is easy reading and written well in proper English.

The reviews of individual cards are represented from two views, so there is some variation, but most of the rankings are right next to each other. The place where the contradictions come in are that when the whole set is looked at, many of the \\"must-have\\" cards were rated middle-of-the-pack during individual reviews.<br />The other material in the book is worth the price alone.

Being a Christian myself and finding that Knuth had given these seminars, I was happy to read the book.<br />Unfortunately, it merely skims the surface of his beliefs. However, there are many items just beneath the surface that more experienced Christians may see. Still, there was not enough insight to garner a five-star rating.<br />Yes, it is a polished transcription of the six seminars, but it is very easy to read. At the end of each, there was a question-and-answer period, which probably help shed as much light as the lecture itself.<br />Yes, it is mostly about his work in &quot;3:16&quot;, but that really gets into his religious journey. That is where part of the problem is -- it is more about the work and less about thoughts or convictions.<br />There is a round-table discussion at the end, which was separate from Knuth's seminars. Knuth says little in it and I would not miss it if it were not there. However, it is good from a historical perspective.<br />For most, especially non-Christians or religion or philosophy majors, this may be of little interest. Recommended, for the right audience.	2003-11-12

At least not directly. I do many of those things and still have had a hard time finding time. I have been trying to simplify my life, and this book is a good route. As the author points out, it does not mean moving into a shanty in the woods miles from anyone.<br />There are many good suggestions and good examples. It is simple to read and can be read five minutes at a time without losing the train of thought.<br />In addition to simplifying and reducing stress, you may find yourself spending less, saving more, more time with your family and be happier as well.

Card Catalog: Prima's Official Strategy Guide	Books	3	14	18	N	N	Could Be Better	The primary reason that I give a lower rating is that the text is not legible. For monsters, this is understandable and forgiveable. For others, it is not.<br />Some of the tips are useful, but many are trite. Still, that helped bring up the overall rating.<br />There are nine cards per page with each card having these:<br /> + card type<BR> + monster type<BR> + attribute<BR> + level<BR> + ATK<BR> + DEF<BR> + rarity<BR> + editorial comments<br />Add a brief set of rules, table of contents and index and that is about all there is. The other things that I expected were things that I mentioned above. I also expected a list of what constitutes the different rarity ratings. This certainly should be in this book, but was not. I will provide an estimate here:<br />C : Common<BR>X : only in structure decks or starter decks<BR>R : Rare (card name in silver foil)<BR>SCR : Secret Rate (sparkling holographic image)<BR>SR : Super Rare (images on foil background)<BR>UR : Ultra Rare (card name in gold foil, image on foil background)<BR>UTR : Ultimate Rare (embossed holographic image with foil lettering)<br />Regardless, it is a book that probably should be in your collection.	2003-11-02

If you are a big-time NFL fan, it might be nicer, but I prefer college football. This is only important because of the final sections of the book where there are the top-10 lists (which are really top-10-NFL lists). Otherwise, it does an adequate job.

Unfortunately, you cannot do that in the game! Having the information available about the schools (over half of the book) and their favorite plays was helpful. So was the descriptions of the plays. However, the play images did not include player movement, which is crucial -- there is no excuse to \\"save space\\" for such crucial information -- one of the big reasons for such books is to be able to carry it and not have to have the game in front of you. The instructions and strategy are good, but not great. Helpful but disappointing.	2003-10-19

This is more like Dilbert moved into this decade. It is funny, insightful and accurate. There are some sexual references, so it may not be for youngsters, but it is probably no more than they hear in school anyhow.<br />So, what is the point of the book? It is humorous, which is good. It also helps the rest of us who are stuck in similar situations to laugh at things and get us through it. Although the &quot;letters to Jeff&quot; are a bit off for me, everything else smacks true-to-life for most people, especially the same generation as the author (which might include you and me).<br />It is easy reading and can be read in small chunks of time (great for reading in your &quot;library&quot; or while standing in line). While it is funny, it probably will not make you embarrass yourself if you are reading in public.	2003-10-14

I have really liked the author's other works and so I expected a lot from this. Maybe that was part of it. I could not give this five stars because it was a little light on details, especially at the end. However, there is a lot of good project information here, from years of experience. Just the fact that it is not huge is a good thing -- too many 40-page books are turned into 600-page tomes so they give an aura of respectability.<br />If you are new to software project management, this is an excellent book to start with (five stars). If you want to get a quick refresher on good ways to run a project, with some modern-day approaches, this is also good. Give it a try.	2003-10-14

I asked many experts which one book they would recommend. This one was on almost everyone's list. Of course, I got it and a half-dozen others. I agree that this is the best of the lot. It is not a for-dummies book, but someone with programming experience and HTML experience should find it easy to start with. I ended up using two bookmarks, one for PHP and one for MySQL, when first starting at different chapters. They merged quickly after that as I learned the two. Very handy.	2003-10-08

Now, I will not say that this book is life changing, but it comes close. If you are prepared for change, which you probably are if you have look this far, then it probably will be life changing.<br />Some of the ideas were revolutionary for me and I have been through a lot of psychobabble both in and out of college. The essential message is to let love win out over fear. No, not the lovey-dovey stuff of the 60s, but real love -- primarily for yourself and secondarily for others, which will flow naturally. And no, it is not the 70s type me-first mentality. Stop that negativeness! That does not mean it is the don't-worry-be-happy of the 80s and 90s either. It is a realistic viewpoint that will make your life better and probably better for those around you.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-10-04

Yes, that seems to be a contradiction. However, it has two purposes -- it not only gets you a good book on the subject, it gets you started on the road of seeing where your values are and only buying things that will really benefit you.<br />The book is easy to read and in small chunks so that it can be read in small increments of time. The only problem I found was that the words are too close to the edges of the page so that it makes it hard to hold in one hand without covering up the text.<br />For the impatient reader, I suggest reading chapter 1 (&quot;The Smiled-Upon Addiction&quot;) followed by chapter 7 (&quot;Anxiety and Stress Relief&quot;). Chapters 8 (&quot;Alternatives to Shopping: From A to Z&quot;) and 9 (&quot;Fighting Back&quot;) are optional but worth skimming. Some chapters, like chapter 5 (&quot;Keeping Track of Shopping Behaviors), chapter 6 (&quot;Learning from Your Shopping Record&quot;) and chapter 10 (&quot;Taking Control of Your Finances&quot;), may be old-hat to those of us that have been in this predicament for a while. So, if it will keep you from recovery, skip those for now.<br />Since there are few good books on how to overcome similar problems, this is a good book.	2003-09-21

It gives excellent advice in an approachable fashion with ideas that stick. Probably about half of it is geared towards students, with most of those in the latter half of the book. Probably less than one-sixth applies only to students -- the rest is good for all of us. Parents of younger children will appreciate the ideas and the constructive ways that they can be presented. Good idea for presents for those parents or parents-to-be. Most teachers should read this or at least skim it and read the sections of interest to them. Recommended.	2003-09-19

This book does a superb job of explaining things that many of have may have thought and felt, not just to violence, but the general world of kids today. Many of my personal experiences are anecdotal, but they certainly match up with what the author writes and appear contrary to many of the \\"solutions\\" that the media and many ivory-tower wannabees present to us. Every time I hear some new (distorted) statistic, I think \\"that can't be right\\". This book gives some insight to why that is. Much of this may not be a total surprise to you, you might have been thinking this way already, but to see it laid out plain and convincing gives a lot of enjoyment. Invest a couple hours, even if only the first chapter -- do it for the kids ... and yourself.	2003-09-15

If you are expecting good advice on how to GET out of debt, this is a good book (probably five stars). However, if you are expecting good advice on how to STAY out of debt, this is not a good book (probably one star). There are hardly any about STAYING out of debt, so I was really looking forward to it. The search continues for such a good book....	2003-09-09

Much of their advice is generic enough to be good and hardly any of their advice is &quot;bad&quot; (like much of their competition). Also, there are some gold nuggets later in the program, so it is worth a listen if you are at any transition points in your life.	2003-09-05

Yes, it is a book worth buying for most couples. It has excellent advice about paying yourself first (by saving), but also rewarding yourself (within reason). The key thing is to get your financial priorities in line with your own values -- which is the hard part. The author does a good job of helping you do this. The author is also level-headed about what can happen, but the title sounds trite in comparison. This was borderline four stars, but considering the competition, this is a five star book.	2003-09-02

Instead, I found a great deal of information in the easy-to-read text. The introductory material is interesting. After that, many games are covered in chronological order. Boy, did it bring back memories. I recall encountering a lot of the same information at the time, lending some credibility to the material. Great history of arcade and home games during a formative decade of the genre. Recommended.	2003-09-01

Some of the stories are the same that you see in many other books, but this book does give you a better grasp of the emotional atmosphere of the 80s and early 90s (the book came out in 97, making it a bit dated, but much of the material is surprisingly relevant today). Easy reading, with the chapters being somewhat artificially broken, good for leisure time.	2003-09-01

I had never really taken comics seriously, but I certainly will give them more heed now. Some comics have been and always will be better served as liner for litter boxes, but some really are good. This book, done in comic format itself, is a wonderful example of that.<br />Not thinking I would even finish the book, I found myself reading more and more of it with each sitting (I often read books five or ten minutes at a time). This was easy reading and educational -- a great combination for me. Give it a try!	2003-08-31

I had been aware of some of these things, but there were several incidents that were ten miles from me that I had no idea about. Small world!<br />This book is along the lines of &quot;Poker Nation&quot; -- a very good read that is illuminating and fun. It is great that we are seeing a wave of these types of books lately.<br />If you are or were into video games, or know someone that is or was, give this book a try. After the first chapter, you will probably be hooked.	2003-08-30

There is a lot of help for learning how to become a better umpire. You will not find a lot of discussions about rules, except for the excellent and extensive coverage on balks. Most practicing umpires do not need so much of that anyhow. This gives excellent advice on analyzing your performance in addition to some mechanics (e.g., being a mobile plate umpire). Some of the biggest help is in the did-he-actually-write-that discussions about how we umpires do make mistakes and how to handle them. The author does not simply say to never admit your mistakes, especially since his West Point education has embedded the opposite.<br />The reading is quick and easy, but at a mature level. Definitely recommended for umpires at all levels.	2003-08-14

It covers the initial problem, the progress through the courts, to decision and brief epilogue. The insights into the inner workings of the Supreme Court are very good. I would not say unprecedented coverage, but possibly unprecedented in a single volume -- some aspects are seen in other books, just not in the same one.<br />The author avoids any political hangups but still generates a sense of something about to happen that is politically huge. Forty years later, it is a big part of our current assumptions about law, which goes to show how powerful it was. For the author to maintain his distance must have required inordinate self control.<br />One of the top-ten books on the Supreme Court.	2003-08-12

There are many areas covered and some that this baseball fan and law fan (by no means am I an attorney, though) that interested me. If you have wondered what goes on behind the scenes, give this book a read. It is easy to read and not at a &quot;high-falutin'&quot; level.	2003-08-03

It may be simplistic to say that the baseball industry strategies will apply to all areas, but one of the first things you learn IS that it will apply to most areas -- because it deals with one long-time commonality -- people. Joe Torre shows that his insight and respect for others really does work and that it is NOT just money.	2003-08-03

Last year we went on a vacation with 11 hours of driving. We saw plates from around 30 states. However, we did not have this informative guide like we did this year.<br />The paper stock is heavy and coated, making it resistant to any \\"accidents\\" that may happen in the car. The pages are oriented horizontally and have a tie so that they are easy to flip. Each page has the plate on one side and a ton of information on the other side (great for keeping inquisitive kids busy). At the back is a good map of the states (a two-page foldout) which can be scanned and printed so that you can check off the states as you see them.<br />The box is sturdy and not too much larger than the book itself, but large enough to allow a pen and pencil in it, as well as a folded map printout (see above).<br />The plates are large, colorful, detailed and current. Great stuff!	2003-07-24

Many of these items are not covered in other books, so it is very helpful.

Of course, you have to have your rulebook(s). Beginners may want to start with books with more verbage on the mechanics. However, more experienced umpires may like the organized and detailed approach in this book. One drawback is the lack of diagrams for showing the umpire mechanics. Otherwise, a good resource to stuff in your bag along with the rulebook(s).	2003-07-22

I have read many books about umpiring (there are more than you might imagine!). This book is probably in the top five of those. The author gives a more laid-back presentation than some others, but there is no doubting the experience and wisdom behind the scenes. The book is easy to read and broad ranging. If you read in this genre, check out this book. If not, this is good enough to give it a try anyhow. You might be surprised how many parents have done volunteer umpiring and this book will give you a good position to talk with them about their experiences.	2003-07-22

Generally a very good book, easy to read and comprehend, laid out well, with good documentation.<br />One thing that bothered me was the (large) number of graphs of stock prices. Part of what bothered me was the number -- I get the point, already. Another part that bothered me was that the stock valuation does not always reflect well on the company, although this often is the case, especially during the time frame right before the book was released. However, my biggest gripe is that the prices were shown in a linear fashion rather than logarithmic. Most people will say &quot;so what&quot; because they are used to seeing linear prices. However, it hides experiences at other prices. For example, a 4x ramp-up at the end will look much more significant than a 20x ramp-up earlier. There is room for some argument about the two, but a logarithmic chart would have been much better.<br />There is some great advice, er, research results. Just reading the summaries at the end of each chapter will enlighten the reader.<br />One of the good things mentioned is that the company should worry less about &quot;motivating&quot; employees and worry more about &quot;NOT DE-motivating&quot; them. This follows well with my experience and the experiences of most good leaders that I know. An analogy of mine is the 100-yard dash. Most people who watch such a race will think that the winner really pulled ahead at the end. However, in reality, it was that the winner maintained the fast pace and the others fell behind. This is the same perspective that this book gives -- the conventional wisdom is often close enough to feel comfortable, but further analysis shows that conventional wisdom needs to be adjusted. This book is good at doing just that.	2003-07-22

As noted by Michael Lewis in &quot;Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game&quot;, Bill James has been the unsung hero of a more level-headed approach to acquiring baseball players. This book does an excellent job of providing some historical background with many (biased) commentaries. However, I found the selections less convincing than I expected.	2003-07-17

They show a wide variety of situations, so if you are looking for particular things like I was (e.g., bat grip), it is very handy.<br />The text is gathered from Derek's peers and provides a great glimpse of what being around him must be like.

In addition to the Official Baseball Rules (OBR) and updates, this may be the only other rulebook that you want (I have read many of them). The diagrams for proper positioning are handy and accurate. The descriptions of real-world situations and how to handle them is right on the money. The breakdown of rules into topical areas is some of the best that I have seen. A few of the items are dated, but you will readily see that compared to OBR. From my umpiring perspective, this is the only non-rules book that I highly recommend.	2003-07-15

Some of the early material caters primarily to indoor practice (for colder climates and/or for high school or college that starts early). The author notes that early on and proceeds with the rest of the material shortly after. Some good general ideas.	2003-07-09

I had put this book near the top of my reading list. Soon after that, I read an excerpt that was from the middle of the book. Little did I know that it was probably one of slowest sections of the book, so I moved it down on my list. When talking with out attorney, he mentioned that the book was really good. The next day I started reading it -- and couldn't put it down. It was really good.<br />You get to know parts about baseball that are rarely covered. Even a non-baseball reader will come away being very informed and capable of passing it on to friends who might be sports freaks. Highly recommended.	2003-07-08

It has additional information for &quot;advanced&quot; hitters, so the separate section does not overwhelm the reader for the majority of applications.<br />The pictures are clear and very helpful. Each section requiring one has one or more. There are many nuggets hidden here -- I learned one that I had not known in about 15 years of playing and &quot;coaching&quot; (as the author puts it).<br />Especially good for kids in Little League, so check it out!	2003-07-08

Having played tournament chess, having written chess software (non-commercial), and especially having been one of a thousand or so at the final games where Kasparov lost, I had high expectations for this book. Perhaps too high. That might explain why I was disappointed.<br />As the author points out, it is not a book on chess analysis and that seems obvious. However, even the analysis from a software standpoint is weak -- it merely seems to be a hardware let's-build-it-one-thousand-times faster. Come to think of it, the author DID state that he was writing the book that way, so I shouldn't be too surprised.<br />I was delighted that the author liked &quot;Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman&quot; (a fantastic book) and that further heightened my expectations. Unfortunately, the book lacked the creativity and humor of anything like that.<br />It was not a &quot;bad&quot; book, just not quite what I expected. That does not discredit the great work done or what might come in the future as a result of it. For that, the accolades are already present.	2003-07-06

Although not everyone can tour Yankee Stadium and ask any question they like (and get very good answers), I expected a lot when I looked at the table of contents for the first section. Unfortunately, the answers are skimpy and insufficient, especially considering that the subtitle claims to be &quot;the total encyclopedia of the team&quot;. Not hardly. The latter section of statistics may be useless, dated or just good for historical purposes. I would pass.	2003-07-06

No, the author did not lead a charmed life, but reading the book made many of the big worries of day-to-day life seem much smaller.<br />The reading is fairly easy and certainly entertaining. Many of the stories are new (some of the other books about MLB umpiring can tend to repeat the same stories. Although the author sticks mostly to his professional life, we get a few glimpses into his personal life as well.	2003-07-01

For those of us in our mid-life stage, it is good to pass on to our children. We may be jaded about some of the ideas, yet those are ones that we also want to impress upon our gets. What better way than from the mouths of the heroes themselves?<br />Of course, there are the typical views of the up-and-comers. For example, Jeter says it has nothing to do with luck. Yet, he gives a large part of the credit for his success to his parents. Of course, as even he recognizes, not all kids are born into such families. Hence, &quot;luck&quot; does have something to do with it. That should not deter us, but it shows the common conflicts of such views.<br />Good gift idea for any younger Yankees fan and parents.	2003-06-18

A lot of it is irreverent, but that is Luciano -- respectful, but humorous. The book is easy to read and broken into sections that make for easy reading a couple pages at a time (ahem, for reading in the family &quot;library&quot;). There is a lot more here than just umpiring. You get the inside scoop on players, managers and some owners. Interesting reading that is a little off the beaten path.	2003-06-16

This is not a picture book, but more of a detailed history with some good photos. I enjoyed all the details and seeing some pictures that I had not seen before. Probably one of the &quot;keepers&quot; of the Yankees 100th craze.	2003-06-12

If anything, I would say that the writing style is wrong. It may be &quot;creative writing&quot; but it reads more like a novel than non-fiction. Now, non-fiction does not mean it has to be boring! Certainly, some of the stories are interesting, but it often became a chore to read. Not a bad book, but certainly not the best it could be.	2003-06-07

This book, &quot;Make the Right Call&quot;, is an adequate addition to that. It has good coverage and good well-explained examples of each. However, I prefer the more recent and more easy-to-follow &quot;Baseball Rules in Plain English&quot; by Jim Booth. If you cannot get the latter book, &quot;Make the Right Call&quot; is recommended.	2003-06-05

If you are involved with Little League, you will see many true moments in this book. Your perpspecitve may be any of player, parent, coach, umpire, spectator. It is quite humorous and will have you both laughing and shaking your head.<br />Especially good for new coaches. You may have heard that Little League is &quot;very political&quot;. It is. The author highlights many ways that it is and also gives very good pointers on how you can get &quot;advantages&quot; in this &quot;non-competitive&quot; environment.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-06-05

Not that it is all one-liners, but the humor is spread throughout the book and often catches you off-guard. I would compare it to Dana Carvey (if you like him) -- good humor that is increased by one's ability to put yourself in another's shoes.<br />I have never umpired professionally, but I have umpired enough amateur games to know that Kaiser is right on the money on much of what he writes. That might make the situations more humorous for me than a &quot;typical&quot; reader, but I doubt it. The writing is easy and friendly and requires very little knowledge of baseball (I would say none, but that might be a stretch).<br />Definitely glad that I read the book!	2003-06-01

Considering that I paid 20 times the price of the book for a single seat, it is certainly a bargain. The best part of the book, for me, was the text descriptions of the different sections. Although the seating diagram does not detail every section (e.g., sections 200-500 are not shown), they are listed in the text descriptions. The information about parking is great. Also about pre-game and post-game activities and timing is easily worth the price of the book.<br />The section on &quot;Yankee slang&quot; is good to know. The other tidbits are interesting.<br />If you are even considering a trip to Yankee Stadium, you must get this book. I might even do as the author suggests and take it with me to the stadium.	2003-05-29

Granted, because I have umpired some Little League games (and hope to umpire more), I may have more interest in this topic than the typical reader. However, I think even the &quot;typical reader&quot; would enjoy this book. I kept thinking that I did not want the book to end. A sequel would be more than welcome!<br />The interviews are laid out well and the reading is easy and entertaining. It is tied together well so that it does not seem like a jumble of questions and answers (it is not a question-and-answer format, but more of a prose format).<br />You get a feel for the game that you may never have gotten before. You get to hear a little about some of the great names of baseball (Williams, DiMaggio, Robinson, etc.) from a new perspective. It is amazing how similar all the different umpires feel about some players and managers. It certainly heightened my respect for the game, especially for the Men in Blue.	2003-05-25

It is about determining what you want to do with your life and what makes you happy (which is often not related to working). It helps you prioritize your life without being obvious about it -- looking at what you like (e.g., follow your heart) and what you are gifted with.<br />Although the author was younger at the time, he has many excellent points and clearly has practiced what he preaches. Too often, people write books or take a one or two year &quot;exercise&quot; and write a book about it -- only to turn away from that.<br />The book was an easy, entertaining and life-redirecting read.	2003-05-21

However, none of the other resources lay things out as clearly as this book does.<br />The reader is taken through a logical sequence of coverage that a typical umpire will encounter. It also is useful for coaches, players and spectators, but I find it most useful for umpiring and making calls on rules.<br />Each section lists the appropriate section of the OBR, so it is good to have OBR at your side as well. The reading is easy, well laid out and printed nicely.<br />This book was certainly worth the price.	2003-05-21

However, there seemed to be just a little emotional detachment, making it slightly harder to pull someone into it. Granted, a compulsive eater may have a hard time with ANY book of this type, but there was just a little missing. Still, this is one of the best books on this subject, so this book should definitely be read for that reason.	2003-05-21

It is small enough to keep in your glove compartment in your car, but big enough that the text and diagram are easy to read and see. The size also makes it easy to hold in one hand and read while eating.

It is a good overview of umpiring for Little League. It does not go into details on all the rules, but gives an overview of what an umpire does there. The pictures were helpful in seeing what hand signals to use and for where the umpire should and should not stand for different situations.<br />Throughout the book are 26 different brief situations that you have to decide upon. The answers are short, clear and helpful. Overall, I think it is an excellent introduction to the topic (I plan to use some of the ideas at the next game that I umpire).	2003-05-13

Some of it is more involved than I would expect, yet some of the more detailed sections skip important details that should have been included. Still, it is probably one of the better buys in this genre.<br />I have played ball over several decades and I even learned a couple things from this book. The coverage was fairly good and the strategies for the different positions and analysis of their requirements and difficulties was something that only a true professional could provide with conviction.<br />This list of &quot;records that are least likely to be broken&quot; were entertaining and convincing -- some things that I probably would not have thought of.	2003-05-11

This may sound simplistic, but only a small percentage of people apply it.<br />This has been one of the best business books that I have read, and I have read hundreds. In many ways, it seems so obvious that many people do not bother to understand it. As a result, we keep re-inventing the wheel and wondering why our resources are being wasted.<br />There are many guidelines of how to spot the ways we are indirectly rewarding the opposite of what we desire. You will soon find yourself often saying to yourself, and hopefully others, &quot;well, the things that get rewarded get done&quot;.<br />This should be required reading for MBA programs, but it was not for the one I was in and it appears it is not in most others. Alas, the things that get rewarded get done.	2003-04-28

This book, at least parts of it (more later), were like those good articles. However, some of the are counter to the typical BS (i.e., Business School) mantras.<br />Did the book have a silver bullet? No. But there are a lot of good ideas within the covers. Certainly, those can be expanded to different industries, but the concept is what is important. If just one person in senior management reads the core of this book during a cross-country flight, it will be worth distributing a copy to each person in senior management.<br />That being said, skip the introductory stuff and start at chapter one. I typically do not do that, while my wife always does. I almost wish I had with this book. I expect a page of praise from readers in books of this type. Instead, there are four pages of quotes, making some of my red flags go up. Followed by a two-page Forward, which I expected. I did not expect a second two-page Forward. Certainly did not expect the seven page Preface to follow that. Then to be topped off with twenty-two page Introduction. You got it -- there is more. A twenty-one page Prologue followed all of that. I was flabbergasted. If it weren't for the expectations to follow, I would have stopped before chapter one.<br />I was encouraged that the authors mentioned books like \\"The Goal\\" by Eliyahu Goldratt and Jeff Cox -- a classic. I was also encouraged with the references to chess and that they were accurate, not the typical drivel from non-players who want to \\"name drop\\" the game into their books.<br />So, what is the ultimate competitive advantage? Not something simple enough for me to include here. However, if you look at the Table of Contents (from Amazon), you will get a good idea of quick concepts that they promote. Many of these are good ones that the good competition is using now. Many more will use them in the future or fall behind and probably go out of business in ten or twenty years (a \\"long time\\" for many people, but for successful corporations, it is just around the corner). Here are some of those chapter titles:<br />+ Increase value without raising prices and costs.<BR>+ Adjust prices to increase sales profitability.<BR>+ Eliminate costs that reduce custer and end-user benefits.<BR>+ Provide sustained benefits for all stakeholders.<BR>+ Share benefits fairly with all who create them.<br />Many of the excellent comments are boxed into one or two sentences on some pages, making it easy for an executive to skim during a one-hour or two-hour flight or some other time of waiting. For that next trip, throw this book into your luggage.	2003-04-24

I am not sure exactly why. I allowed that some of it may be my own personal experiences. Although I have had rough and tough times, I have never lost a child or spouse. That may have lead to me &quot;missing something&quot; in the text.<br />However, about half-way through, I really started getting something from the book. It felt like the author was really opening up to what was really going on. Perhaps it was just my perceptions that were changing, but it felt like the author was leading on a journey to a more enlightening relationship with God. Her reliance on God had been clear, but it seemed to be more real in that she could really mentor the readers now.<br />I imagine that if you are in a similar situation, the book would be even more helpful while not being preachy or an intensive theological research into the topic -- friendly and open.	2003-04-20

Still, it is one that many people should read. At least read &quot;Economy&quot; and &quot;Conclusion&quot; (which is not really a conclusion, but more of a continuation).<br />Some have criticized Thoreau of being hypocritical. It is easy to see why. He chastises gossip, but then produces gossip on the printed page so that many will read it well after the fact. To be true to himself, it should have stayed within himself. He could have provided examples for our benefit without being quite so particular.<br />Another example is condemning the &quot;corporate&quot; life, but then he proceeds to closely detail his manner of how he could make a living off the land -- not merely eating what he sowed, but that he sowed enough to make money doing it. Although he disliked local farmers giving him advice, he still disperses equivalent advice to his readers -- not taking a look in the mirror.<br />I had expected more and it started out on a good note. This was written when he was 30. Although that would not be considered mid-life now, it probably was then. It certainly was in his case (he died of TB at 45). He starts with many things that one may learn during mid-life, which was encouraging, but then slowly turned it mostly into gripe sessions and simple anti-establishment diatribes. Although I agree with many of his points, too much bitterness was showing through.<br />However, the baby should not be thrown out with the bath. There is much good and it has a generally positive outlook for one's life. He did this as an experiment and because he did not continue it, one must ask if the experiment was a failure. I think therein lies the greatest thought provoked by this book.	2003-04-16

Although some of the writing is very similar (especially to the &quot;Economy&quot; section of &quot;Walden&quot;), this book is too grating. For several pages, I find myself nodding my head in agreement. But, the short barbed attacks become too frequent and too spiteful to hold a lot of water.<br />It becomes more clear why some consider Thoreau hypocritical, although I do not (entirely) agree. However, this book would seem to paint him that way. For example, he complains that it is amazing how many people spend time to gossip about Mr. X when he wouldn't go around the corner to see the world explode. Well, how did he know of the gossip of Mr. X without having spent time on it. Not only that, he &quot;wasted&quot; time writing about it. Not only that, we spend time 150 years later reading about it!<br />Don't bother with this book -- read &quot;Walden&quot; instead.	2003-04-15

It was. This book can be a life-saver, literally. It certainly made a huge impact for me.<br />The book may be a bit too much for a person to read unless they like psychology. No, it is not hard reading, it just may be too much material unless you were looking for specific advice. Although you may be tempted to jump to your immediately applicable section, I would suggest reading chapter 2 (on men's different eras) before doing that.<br />The author has a friendly, mature, informed approach. It is analytical, yet comforting. Certainly a book to recommend for men in your life that are going through changes.	2003-04-13

There is a fair amount of coverage of different topics, but some of it seems to broad to be of specific help. I looked for specific things and there was very little on that. However, the coverage of support groups was good and encouraging, especially as a cost-effective alternative to psychotherapy (only after consulting a physician). The style was approachable and I had hoped the coverage was more specific in some areas.	2003-04-08

I have read the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" (LotR) trilogy eight times. I think that Peter Jackson's movies are the best to day. I think that the 13-hour BBC production is the best radio play to date. Although this 55-hour 46-CD set is the only unabridged audio book for LotR, I doubt that it could be surpassed.<br />Inglis does an excellent job at articulation and dramatization, giving different intonation and mannerisms to different characters. It really is as if you were reading the book.<br />The recording is very good. The CDs performed well. The packaging is excellent, in a cardboard case, with three cardboard boxes, each with three liners that can hold up to four CDs each.<br />One thing that I liked about this is that each track is around three minutes long. This is great for when you have to stop and pick up later -- especially if your portable CD player does not remember the track!<br />Another thing that I liked was the lack of dynamic range. Yes, the lack of it. The loudness is very even across a wine range of topics. This is especially important when listening in the car or with headphones, typically in noisy environment. With some other products, I was constantly turning the volume up and down. Not with this set. However, the performance of the reading did not suffer at all because of this. That is great!<br />This should be in every library of LotR fans, especially those that travel a lot and want to listen while on the go. Highly recommended!	2003-04-02

The reading is easy, entertaining and informative.<br />Although the author's religious background (Lutheran) is different from mine (Reformed, Christian Reformed Church), I never felt slighted (well, except for the one time he referred to us &quot;Calvinists&quot;).<br />I was a little nervous about the lack of his references to God and God's leading. However, I gave the benefit of the doubt that it was the intent of the author to not throw &quot;religion&quot; in the face of the reader. That has pros and cons. I would have liked to have read more about his personal religious journey with God, not just with other people.<br />Overall, an enjoyable book, especially for someone like me who is usually more heavily into non-fiction.	2003-03-27
1179308:US	52976583	R2MNO4IQ4Z2QTP	0553456539	763758332	The Lord of the Rings (BBC Dramatization)	Books	5	11	12	N	N	Fantastic	This CD set is fantastic. For qualifications, I have read the trilogy seven times (just started my eighth) over many years. I have listened to nearly every radio play, seen nearly every movie and watched many professional local plays related to it. This BBC production is certainly one of the best.<br />If you like the recent Peter Jackson movie renditions of the trilogy, you will probably like this set as well. They are very similar. This set is more accurate, but it is somewhat understandable that the movie takes more literary license.<br />Yes, like the movie, there are some things taken out (Tom Bombadil, for example). However, this should not be surprising. The unabridged audio version of the trilogy runs something like 55 hours. This set is less than 13 hours - less than 24% of the length! The movies are something like 9 hours, but the visual aspect helps fill in a lot of the details. Although the audio version allows some filling in, too, it obviously does it less so. There are some sound effects that may go unnoticed unless you know the story. This does not detract from the story, but encourages reading it again.<br />One drawback is the dynamic range. Usually, a wide dynamic range like this recording is a good thing. However, when I am driving and listening, I often found myself adjusting the volume so that it was not too quiet or too loud. Sometimes this was a nuisance, but the quality of the audio more than made up for this &quot;deficiency&quot;.<br />Another drawback was the number of tracks and their length. Some of them ranged from 2 minutes to 23 minutes averaging 6 tracks per CD. With it being so easy for a CD to have as many tracks as desired (although 20 is a comfortable maximum because of the displays on some CD players), there was no need for some of the tracks to be so short or so long. This was especially noticeable when the track would shift in the middle of a session or a track would have three or four sessions in one track. The main reason this was a nuisance for me was on my portable CD player. When I turn it off, it does not remember where it stopped (it does remember the track, but some other players do not). So, I would have to remember where I stopped and then fast-forward or rewind for up to 12 minutes.<br />The production itself is excellent. The voices are clear, well articulated and expressive. Each character sounds nearly as well as I imagine they would -- they bring life to the sound waves. The sound editing is excellent. The instrumental music is sparse, but very good. The vocal music ranges from good to excellent and is mostly located at three-quarters of the set and the last CD or so.<br />One test for me is whether the ending makes me cry! Now, I rarely cry at movies, plays, reading books or listening to them. In fact, only three movies have made me really cry (&quot;Greystoke: the Legend of Tarzan&quot;, &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; and &quot;Beaches&quot;) and two books (one of the Sugar Creek Gang books and the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy). When my wife and I read the trilogy outloud together, the last paragraphs took ten to fifteen minutes to complete. This audio set is the same. It is so moving that it is very difficult to keep a stiff upper lip. Like Frodo, I failed. But all's well that ends better!	2003-03-27

It was illuminating and had good scripture references. It was especially interesting to be listening to RC Sproul's (Reformed) tape-of-the-month tapes on this subject at the same time. It was like they were both reading from the same script. Come to think of it, they were!<br />The reading is simple and broken down into easily manageable chapters, which makes good reading for those times when you only have ten minutes or so at a time. The level is good for both new Christians and more mature ones and even for non-Christians (an invitation is given). Definitely worth reading and something you might want to leave laying out so visitors can see it (they might want to borrow it).	2003-03-26

I have seen all the movies, good and bad, and seen many local productions. I have listened to many radio plays (the 13-CD BBC production is one of my favorites), often several times. I mention those just to say that my standards are high.<br />Recently, I was looking for some detailed maps online. I looked many places. Most of them were disappointing and none met my needs. When I read the reviews for this book, I was very excited, but tried to keep my hopes in check. There was no need -- this book met my needs and then some.<br />The maps are done by a professional cartographer and it shows in the excellent quality and care for detail. The two-color (black and red, with shades) maps are drawn clearly and detailed. I never had to squint to read the lettering.<br />The summary sections are well-informed, with references for more support for the reader, and covering a wide area of time and topic. Look at the table of contents on Amazon and you will see the wide coverage. Split into sections by the different ages, the sections covering the LotR is detailed. Geographical areas are covered as are the travels of the different parties. Even tables of days and distance and speed are laid out very well.<br />The last section has information on landforms, climate, vegetation, population and languages. Interesting reading that was totally unexpected.<br />This truly is a work of love and worth every penny.	2003-03-24

This was one of my favorite learning books about 30 years ago (the first printing was 37 years ago, but this level of chess is timeless). Now that my 9 year old son is learning to play, under his own motivation, it was just a little too much to begin with (the reading level is about fifth-grade level).<br />The book is laid out so that you can read it both directions. All the pages on the right are right-side-up. You read the right-hand page and then turn to the next one. At the end, you flip the book over and start going the other direction. This is usefull because most of the pages have some kind of instructional setup on one page and you have to solve or answer something, with the answer on the following page. Very easy to use and keeps you from &quot;cheating&quot; by accidentally seeing the answer (like books with the answer on the same page).<br />It is very easy to pick up and learn things 30 seconds at a time -- making it great for reading during travel, while standing in line or while visiting the household &quot;library&quot;.<br />The concepts progress smoothly from simple to more complex. Someone said that you really don't understand something until you can explain it to a 6 year old. Fischer is a grandmaster and his true experience shows through in how he does present everything in a manner that is easy to understand and makes you want to say &quot;of course!&quot; after learning it.<br />For any avid chess player, this should be in any chess library of 10 books or less (certainly in any library of hundreds of chess books like mine has been).	2003-03-11
1202570:US	52976583	RWD9YO2LN7W9Q	8472234592	371745880	Gödel, Escher, Bach (Spanish Edition)	Books	5	10	11	N	N	Must for Math Majors and Enlightened Individuals	This book is a must for math majors (as well as many logic and philosophy majors). Anyone else in the hard sciences should also read this book, at least to be enlightened. Initially, it is easy reading, then becomes slightly foggy, but pushing through is rewarding. Of the three, my favorite is Godel and I always mention his Incompleteness Theorem whenever his name comes up. It his probably actually best mentioned by Rudy Rucker in his book &quot;Infinity and the Mind&quot;. I think it is significant enough to mention here:<br />---<BR>The proof of Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem is so simple, and so sneaky, that it is almost embarassing to relate. His basic procedure is as follows: <br />1. Someone introduces Gödel to a UTM, a machine that is supposed to be a Universal Truth Machine, capable of correctly answering any question at all. <br />2. Gödel asks for the program and the circuit design of the UTM. The program may be complicated, but it can only be finitely long. Call the program P(UTM) for Program of the Universal Truth Machine. <br />3. Smiling a little, Gödel writes out the following sentence: &quot;The machine constructed on the basis of the program P(UTM) will never say that this sentence is true.&quot; Call this sentence G for Gödel. Note that G is equivalent to: &quot;UTM will never say G is true.&quot; <br />4. Now Gödel laughs his high laugh and asks UTM whether G is true or not. <br />5. If UTM says G is true, then &quot;UTM will never say G is true&quot; is false. If &quot;UTM will never say G is true&quot; is false, then G is false (since G = &quot;UTM will never say G is true&quot;). So if UTM says G is true, then G is in fact false, and UTM has made a false statement. So UTM will never say that G is true, since UTM makes only true statements.<br />6. We have established that UTM will never say G is true. So &quot;UTM will never say G is true&quot; is in fact a true statement. So G is true (since G = &quot;UTM will never say G is true&quot;).<br />7. &quot;I know a truth that UTM can never utter,&quot; Gödel says. &quot;I know that G is true. UTM is not truly universal.&quot; <br />Think about it - it grows on you ... <br />With his great mathematical and logical genius, Gödel was able to find a way (for any given P(UTM)) actually to write down a complicated polynomial equation that has a solution if and only if G is true. So G is not at all some vague or non-mathematical sentence. G is a specific mathematical problem that we know the answer to, even though UTM does not! So UTM does not, and cannot, embody a best and final theory of mathematics ... <br />Although this theorem can be stated and proved in a rigorously mathematical way, what it seems to say is that rational thought can never penetrate to the final ultimate truth ... But, paradoxically, to understand Gödel's proof is to find a sort of liberation. For many logic students, the final breakthrough to full understanding of the Incompleteness Theorem is practically a conversion experience. This is partly a by-product of the potent mystique Gödel's name carries. But, more profoundly, to understand the essentially labyrinthine nature of the castle is, somehow, to be free of it. <BR>---<br />This is the kind of mental freedom you will gain by reading this book. Highly recommended.	2003-03-07

If you are like most people, you are probably only aware of Bunyan's \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\". There may be some justification to why most people are not familiar with this book. It is not bad, but it is not in the same league as other classics.<br />Of course, I like Frank Peretti's more modern tone, but I also allow adjustments for a book over 300 years old (many excellent classics are even older). But, this book goes over and over the same material much too often. Yes, repetition can be good for the soul. But, at some points, I was thinking it was a bit too much. Some of the applications, though, were well presented and in a way you rarely see in books and sermons today. That made it worth reading.<br />The names given to the individuals were very creative. They get your mind to think how the wiles of the Evil One work their way even today. The end summary is still very accurate: the Evil One will not be contained until God does it, much like God did not take away Paul's \\"thorn\\".	2003-03-01

He gives a coherent and convincing case why, unfortunately, we will be required to invade Iraq at some time. It looks like that time draws closer.<br />The overview of Iraqi history, and the Middle East for that matter, is very good. It brings you up to speed very quickly and reminds you of all the tidbits you may have heard over the past several decades.<br />The logic behind why we must invade, possible ways of doing it and ways of cleaning up afterward are very persuasive and comprehensive. It is not often that the general public gets to see such \\"reports\\".<br />It was interesting that only one film was mentioned in the book -- \\"Black Hawk Down\\". If you check my review of that film, you will see that I think it is one of the best and most realistic war films of all time. The author cites it for its accuracy about having to fight in large cities in particular.<br />The book kept my attention like few history books do. Most of the ones I read take effort to get through. This one was like a fast-paced action thriller. As some have said, this book is the starting point for discussions about Iraq. I agree, as do several others that I recommended the book to and who read it. No matter which way you lean, this book will certainly help you make more informed choices.	2003-02-26

Even if they did, do their kids? In that respect, this book inspires bonding time and passing that knowledge onto children.

The maps are detailed, clear and easy to read. The text is insightful and helpful. I learned much more about each area than I expected. The number of wines highlighted within each area is limited, but the detail summaries of those areas more than make up for that. The sections on wineries and wine-making is also excellent and up-to-date. Many other books merely have a theoretical overview whereas this book has that as well as details of how an actual modern-day winery is architected and run. The pictures are excellent, but there were a couple beautiful ones that did not have a description. The book is large is height, but not too thick, so it is still &quot;user-friendly&quot; for reading. A great book idea for a special gift for wine lovers.	2003-02-08

This book fills that niche very nicely.<br />There were some items that we had acquired that we knew were really good -- the authors had done their research and it was encouraging that they found the same and for similar reasons. That gave me some reference as to their experience.<br />The book is up-to-date. They have equipment that is top-notch and widely available. The photos are excellent.<br />The book is also a great resource for items you may not have considered or known about. I know that we now have several more items on our list of equipment to buy.

The author's analysis of some poems can be questioned (whose cannot?), but the wealth of material presented is incredible. This is THE reference book about her life. So, if you want details about the woman behind the beautiful words, then get this book. Also consider visiting her house in Amherst (MA), which still has tours during the warmer months. All three things will give you a very good look into her writing.	2003-02-05

If you have a gambling problem, do not read this book. It is a great book, but it will certainly make you want to start playing Blackjack.<br />I could hardly put it down. I thought that &quot;Poker Nation&quot;, about Texas Hold'em Poker, was an excellent book. This one is even better, but about Blackjack.<br />The characters come alive and you feel your own adrenaline pumping, both in the good times and bad. I nearly felt like running away when the characters were frozen stiff. Good stuff.<br />Fortunately, you do get a grasp of how hard it is to beat the house, and now you know some of the ways that it gets even tougher. Kevin Lewis, one of the main characters, gives an excellent brief essay at the back about card counting, bidding and money management.<br />Definitely a book to get if Blackjack is your game. Even if not, this is great quick reading for sheer entertainment.	2003-02-03

At times, there may have been too much emphasis on the dogs, or too much on just falcons (red-tailed hawk coverage would have been great, but the author caters to peregrine falcons, so it is obviously his choice). Regardless, the amount of detailed coverage is impressive and written very well. Fortunately, the author eases you into the detail and doesn't toss it in your lap like some books. Whenever a new falconry term is mentioned in the text, there is a small side-bar definition of that term.<br />Some have said that the author's attitude gets in the way. When I read the few pages from the website, I also got a little of that. However, when I read the rest of the book, I did not get that at all. Often, appearances can be deceiving.	2003-01-27

Although it is geared towards a group setting, it also is excellent for individuals. This is the basis of some of the \\"megachurch\\" growth, but I think that has gotten a bad rap. Much of that growth is genuine and it is the (bad) copy-cats that give them a bad reputation (I have been in churches of all sizes and currently in a small-medium sized church). The basis is a sincere desire to walk with God. That is paramount. This book builds on the stepping stones of many other spiritual successes, which is often quite different than the world's definition of success (number, appearance, human-focus). This book is well-written and easy to read. It is short, so many of the chapters can be read in a matter of minutes.	2003-01-21

My favorite wine is Riesling and favorite terroir is Germany, especially Mosel-Saar-Ruwer. This book has that covered.<br />Granted, some of the vintage information is three years old. However, the reputations of the wineries has not changed that much. Vintages matter more in Germany and most European areas and much less so in places like California. However, much of that information can be applied equally to all German wineries, so looking online for general vintage information will do just as well -- the relative ratings in the book will still apply, so they are still helpful.<br />I also dislike using German currency, even though it is a German book that was translated (and translated exceptionally well, I might add). I would have preferred seeing prices in US currency for different price ranges.<br />A couple of (very short) sections seem to be a marketing campaign for German wines (perhaps that is how it is seen in the industry, as I would suspect, so that would be acceptable). This only amounts to a handful of pages, so not that bothersome.<br />There are good miniature tutorials on German terminology, wine labels, grapes, Pradikat and other classifications. There are 30 color photographs of different vineyard owners/managers. There are several different sections listing the best estates, along with the author's favorite picks from different wines.<br />The following sections are covered, with many estates from each section:<br />Ahr<BR>Baden<br />Franken<BR>Hessische Bergstrasse<BR>Mittelrhein<BR>Mosel-Saar-Ruwer<BR>Nahe<BR>Pfalz<BR>Rheingau<BR>Rheinhessen<BR>Saale-Unstrut<BR>Sachsen<BR>Wurttemberg<br />Each section has a description of that area as well as a scaled map. Immediately after that is a brief list of names broken down into their rating. For example, Mosel-Saar-Ruwer has 6 five-grape, 15 four-grape, 22 three-grape, 20 two-grape and 5 one-grape ratings. There are an additional 26 \\"other notable producers\\" that do not have detailed pages for those estates.<br />Each rated estate has a full page (or more) with great information about each. Besides access information (owner, address, phone, fax, directions, hours, history, etc.), there is a box about recent productions. This includes the vineyard area (in hectares), annual production (in bottles), top site, soil types, grape varieties (by percentage), average yield (hl/ha) and best vintages of that time. After that is a commentary on the vineyard as well as ratings of some 10 to 20 wines. After that is a black-and-white photo of the vineyard label, which is greatly helpful when looking for the wines at a wine shop.<br />At the back of the book are sections on the best sparkling wines, Marc and Fine, information bureaus and wine glasses.<br />Overall, it is an excellent and useful tool for German wines. Well worth the price, which is hardly more than a single bottle from most of the good wines of this region. Definitely a book to own and know.	2003-01-19

Of course, there are the warning about abuse and how those types of concerns have kept wine from being &quot;promotoed&quot; in the U.S. That is unfortunate.<br />If you want to have an idea of how to have fun and live longer having fun, start with this book. More research comes out all the time, but this book is an excellent primer so that you really know what you are talking about.	2003-01-09

We use it in conjunction with TurboTax to do our taxes, which we file electronically. The tax guide comes in handy for in-depth review of some aspects as well as having a hard-copy throughout the year (well after taxes are filed) so that we can make informed tax decisions. It is a little pricey, but the ton of information and good examples make it worthwhile.	2003-01-07

What makes the book worthwhile, though, is the photographs. They are plentiful and great. Most are current color photos, but some of the vintage black-and-white (some from Ansel Adams) are excellent. Many of the wineries are shown as well as different aspects of the wine-making business. Even street signs and other everyday activities are included, making it a down-to-earth tour guide and photo book. Very appealing to the eye.	2003-01-05

Some of the typical things (opening, storing, etc.) are wrapped up quickly at the end of the book. The main approach is to be able to identify and enjoy the BigSix wine grapes (Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon). She goes in-depth into the differences between them and makes it easy for the reader to distinguish their characteristics. The section with maps that show the areas around the world is helpful and not seen in most other books (e.g., you can see the Gulf Stream effect in Europe). She mentions many producers that are good, making it easier to pick wines at a shop or restaurant, without a laundry list of items that are impossible to memorize. Overall, an excellent book.	2003-01-04

It covers the basics as well as going into detail about the important varietals one needs to know. There were details about ordering at restaurants that I have not seen in books three times the length. Hardly any others have had a how-to on visiting a vineyard and this one was very good. Nice non-intimidating book.	2003-01-03

I don't know about &quot;genius&quot;, but it does put one well ahead of the pack, which might be considered genius. There is a lot of information in a brief easy-to-read book. Many of the myths (e.g., some 100-point rating systems) are exposed, which is sure to cause lack of support from some advertising-based magazines. Regardless, there is a lot about grapes, areas, storage, purchasing at wine stores and at restaurants, etc. Basic questions for new wine lovers and very good answers.	2003-01-02

The early section on making wine is good, but I felt like I was taking a 3-hour tour of San Francisco. Granted that the subtitle is &quot;an introductory guide to the grape&quot;, it could have been less rushed and used the same amount of space. The sections on the different AVAs are excellent -- some of the best informative condensed coverage that I have read. The list of preferred producers of each type is very good, without tying down to specific prices or vintages. The brief list of 10-bottle and 20-bottle starter collections at the back is very helpful (and very similar to what I started with!). Good book. The informative casual cartoons convinced me to change it from four stars to five stars.	2003-01-01

Ignore the fact that GenXers are the authors -- they have experience with wine and it shows (they are also excellent writers). Their material is presented in an easy-to-read non-pretentious informative manner. There are many things that are not covered in most other wine books that I have read. Not to mention that it is one of the few books that are up-to-date. Subjects are handled like large family picnics -- lots of information passed on the by-the-by and quaffed like liquid manna. Definitely a must-read for wine lovers.	2002-12-30

They give the same advice that the current experts are giving, but in a more easily read presentation. For that, I would give it five stars, but the outdated articles pull it down to four stars. Worth checking out, especially for avid readers of wine material.	2002-12-30

I live in central Connecticut (just outside Hartford) and was pleased with the coverage in this area and the Eastern / Northeastern areas in general. Each major winery has a brief discussion and broad rating. There is information on different grape varietals as well as a condensed how-to section on how wine is made. There is coverage on some places to stay and places to eat in the respective areas. As the author notes, this is not an exhaustive tome, but is a helpful guide based on the author's personal experience and recommendation -- often the best kind of guide to have.	2002-12-29

The photos are very good quality, varied and informative. I just wish they had used a Screwpull for a photo instead of those silly wing-type corkscrews. Some personel are covered, from various wineries, which is interesting (similar to the &quot;Wine Spectator&quot; or &quot;Wines &amp; Spirits&quot; coverage). Most of the content focuses on grapes and land, with some coverage of equipment usage.	2002-12-19

The categories are just the right size (some other books are either too broad or too detailed). However, the reasoning at how to pair without a table is only so-so. The author goes to great extent (too far?) pointing out her qualifications and experience with doing this, but is it necessary? A good one-third of the book could be dropped without noticing. I would only keep the one-third with the tables. Regardless, it is one that I will continue to refer to when I want new ideas or confirmation.	2002-12-19

When hearing testimony from some criminals, serial killers for example, it is much harder to separate psychological problems from physiological problems from societal problems and so on. With crackers (bad hackers), it is a little easier. When one of them lays out all this material in an informational organized manner, we need to take note. This book is such a case.<br />Many crackers will brag about their technical prowess and escapades. Very few will brag about their social equilance. By far, the latter is more dangerous, as any (good) computer security expert knows.<br />The book starts out with many good examples of vulnerabilities in an easy-to-read manner. I learned several new areas where I need to tighten my OWN security. Kaching!<br />Where it really starts getting good is in the applications. Sections 2 and 3 are good, but especially good are chapters 11 (&quot;Combining Technology and Social Engineering&quot;), 15 (&quot;Information Security Awareness and Training&quot;) and 16 (&quot;Recommended Corporate Information Security Policies&quot;). Chapter 16 is well worth the price of the book, all by itself.<br />If you are serious about REAL computer security that is effective, you must read this book.	2002-12-18

TWB is full of good information. Of course, the first section is a must-read. Then, the sections are split into separate geographical areas and are very good and very detailed, while still being easy to read (the author's &quot;education&quot; background is readily apparent and helpful to the reader). I especially liked the depth of information that is presented in a friendly manner. For example, I wanted more in-depth information on Valpolicella. Most books given only a paragraph to it, if they give anything at all. Over several sections, this book probably had close to three pages (a lot of text on each page) which is about ten times the information of the competition. And no, this book is not lopsided in favor of information on Italy. That is just one example of why this book gets five stars. There are many other cases of information that other books do not contain or they gloss over. This book has a lot to offer.	2002-12-16

If you want to explore interesting things in Connecticut, this is the book to start with. My son and I often do interesting things on Saturday mornings. Part of it is just &quot;bonding time&quot;, but part of it is that mom works every other Saturday, so those days we have special freedom to do interesting things. And we do. During warm months, an emphasis is on hiking and outdoor activities. During cold months, if we are not sledding, we try more indoor activities.<br />Many of the things that we have done are in this book. I was pleasantly surprised. I bought this as a present for mom so that maybe she can join in more often (she does better if she has a picture in her mind and this book is full of pictures).<br />Explore Connecticut by visiting &quot;everyday&quot; places you might not have noticed. These are the kinds of places that out-of-staters might ask &quot;have you been there&quot; but the residents do not even know they exist -- right next door. Definitely worth taking a look at.	2002-12-12
1308362:US	52976583	RZZAZ70SYG7AI	1402700903	120070300	Windows on the World Complete Wine Course: 2003 Edition: A Lively Guide (Kevin Zraly's Complete Wine Course)	Books	5	46	50	N	N	Heights Unmatched	This book is named after the restaurant &quot;Windows on the World&quot; (WotW) which was near the top of the World Trade Center (NYC). Although I had been to the top of the WTC many times, I never made it to WotW. I wish I had. If this book is any indication (especially the 2003 edition with stories and pictures about the restaurant itself), it must have been a wonderful experience.<br />For beginners, this book should be read after &quot;Wine for Dummies&quot; (WfD). I recommend WfD as the book to purchase if you only want one book. If you want two or more, which is very likely, the second one is this one, &quot;Windows on the World Complete Wine Course&quot; (WotWCWC). This book covers reds and whites, in depth, as well as a clearly diagrammed set of geography pictures and notes.<br />The author takes out much of the snobbishness of others, presenting a great deal of information in an attractive manner. This is great for the library as well as a book that can be laid out on a table for casual reading by guests.<br />There is a FAQ section towards the back that is very good. There are also some suggestions for starting your own collection and for those that want to make a restaurant wine list (which is also a must-read because some of it will apply to your own collection).<br />This book is a must-have for a wine library. Your guests will also appreciate it.	2002-12-11

The information is worthwhile, there just is not an abundance of it and it is more of a coffee-table book. The writing style is great, much like we would expect from WSJ. The personal notes are entertaining and not overdone, all the while being informative. I did not get a sense of the authors being snobs, as others have noted. I found it informative about the variety of wine types and good wineries to watch for. Enjoyable reading.	2002-12-06

In an hour or so, you can get up to speed quick enough not to be totally embarrassed at a wine shop. After reading the whole book, you will have a surprising amount of information at your disposal. There is good coverage of tips on wine tasting, selecting, collecting, etc. There is also very good coverage of the various types of wine and the major countries that make it available. Near the end is a FAQ of sorts which is helpful, as are the appendices. Very little wasteful information (i.e., fluff) and the information is very good stuff. Highly recommended.	2002-12-04

I also purchased &quot;Wine for Dummies&quot; (WfD) by the same authors. I recommend that, instead (not necessary to get both, at least at first). The WfD book has excellent coverages of different countries and that information provides a great deal of groundwork. Only if you know all of that information cold, then consider this book.<br />Much of the vintage information is dated. The authors mention in WfD that vintage is much less important, yet they refer to it often, as in this book. This is to be expected, but not quite consistent with their theories. That being said, much of the date related information is old -- 5 years is past prime for many wines that we buy for drinking with our dinners. Hence, I think it is dated and it is much better just to refer to WfD.	2002-12-02

I have like the author's previous books and articles and was looking for a lot of coverage on this topic. Although the material presented is worth reading, much of it is repeated and much of it could be left out (some of the recorded dialog was worth including, but probably only one-third of it was needed). Read his other books first, then possibly this one.	2002-11-22

AotG presents a broader base for what problems exist (e.g., watering down the gospel) and why they exist. MPftC is more of a practical application -- now that AotG has shown what to avoid, MPftC shows a better way to implement things in your church. Our denomination (CRC - Christian Reformed Church) has most of those things in place and does a pretty good job of staying true to how a church should be run. MPftC helps keep our minds in line with doing the right things and not just things because &quot;we've always done it that way&quot;. Most of the chapters and appendixes are taken from sermons at the author's church. The format is easy to read and well organized. The appendixes fill the final one-third of the book and are required reading. I recommend getting both books for your church library (we have AotG and probably will get MPftC soon).	2002-11-12

Repetition can be a good teaching device, but it can make a book harder to read when it is done too often.<br />There are some discussions about Spurgeon, some in detail, but it was not excessive. I think history can be a good teacher. Our times are not so different from 100 years ago.<br />The author is the pastor of a large church, but don't let that be a determining factor (Scripture should be). He points out what many successful large churches have at their core -- striving after God's will and not man's will. Unfortunately, too many churches try to find the little \\"tricks\\" that large churches use to get people in the doors. They forget that there are no tricks, just follow God and He will bless as HE desires -- the church may or may not grow in numbers (width) but certainly will grow in Him (depth).<br />If you, like I, have been at a church that puts numerical growth before spiritual growth, you probably have some idea of how cancerous it can be. Pray that our churches shun that and follow God. This book is a good start.	2002-11-07

It is accurate and informative. It will help destroy some of the myths surrounding the gift of prophecy and will bring you closer to God's desire. Being Reformed (CRC), I have had many questions about the gift of prophecy (gathered over many years and many book). Almost all of them have been answered here. As J.I. Packer wrote, this book is &quot;Careful, thorough, wise, and to my mind, convincing.&quot; I agree. You will find scripturally-based answers to what the gift is, who can have it, how it is used, and how it can benefit the Church. I highly recommend it, as well as they CRC Acts of Synod 1973 (nearly 30 years old!). This book is much newer, but covers much of the same ground. Read it and pray for God's illumination on the matter.	2002-10-28

No need for a twenty pound tome when this book does it nicely (which is typical of O'Reilly books). A wealth of detail, including screen-shots, that will get you over many hurdles for starters.

This book reports on many interviews the author had with experts in many different areas. Many other resources are presented and reviewed. This saves a tremendous amount of time for someone wanting to research the validity of Christ. There are probably many things you did not know about and also many things you do know about but never connected. This book is one of the must-read books of the Christian faith.	2002-10-02

You may have thought many of these same things, but it is unusual to see it in print. There IS evil and it is good to differentiate between evil that is \\"natural\\" and \\"super-natural\\". This book covers many aspects of this and some ideas of what can be done. In a way it is spooky, but we often fear what we do not know, so in that way this book is comforting. I recommend this to anyone who has had emotional or psychological patterns now or in the past, or anyone that is close to someone who has. That includes just about everyone.	2002-10-01

I listed to this audiobook set and it is great. The presentation quality is excellent, but the content quality is fantastic. For example, his win-win section is better than any other I have seen. Most people (even experts) seem to think that win-win mean that one person wins and the other person is made to think he also wins, but is not quite that way (even if they don't say it, their end result is that it MUST be that way based on their model). Dawson's is a true win-win as is this audiobook.	2002-09-30

When I was growing up, I rode my bike to the library and read as many books as I could. In many ways, I was following in the steps of Thomas Edison (one of my idols). No, I was not the \\"success\\" that he was, but many of his goals were similar. He would go to the Detroit public library (about a half hour from my house) and read books, somewhat at random but in alphabetical order -- all kinds of topics. I did much the same, but it was more focused along what I liked. As for fiction, this book was one of the best.<br />I read it when in elementary school, middle school, high school and college. I have not read it as an adult, but now that my son is at that age, I plan to get it for him (and possibly read it myself!).<br />I really liked \\"Today I am a Ham\\", but not as much as this book. I liked \\"Lord of the Rings\\" probably better than this book, which would account for my reading that trilogy 7 times.<br />If you want to encourage your child to go into the hard sciences, this book will certainly do that. Even if you do not want that, this book is certainly entertaining. Compared to television and movies, it would be a mix of \\"McGuyver\\" and \\"Stand By Me\\".	2002-09-30

If you have addictions of any kind, you should read this book. At the core of what keeps us addicted is often shame and the rejection of the power of grace. We may be shamed by ourselves, our family, our church or our society. We miss the magnitude and scope of God's grace. Satan thrives on that and convinces us how despicable we are, driving us further into our addictions (how can a miserable person like me deserve to be close to God). A vicious cycle, which was close to being broken, continues anew. This book helps us understand that, which gets us on the path to recovery.	2002-09-28

For a high school neighbor graduating next year, I plan to give these two dictionaries and Richard Feynman's book &quot;Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!&quot;.

If you want a larger bookshelf volume, but not as large as the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), get the Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (10th edition).

We are studying Matthew in our Sunday School class. Just about every question we come up with is covered in this book -- competently and clearly. Some questions are unanswered by the various study bibles we have (NIV, Life Application, New Geneva, Scofield, etc.) or they might have a sentence or two. However, when I look at this volume by Hendricksen, there are often three or four pages of information! Sure, I wish there had been more information about the missing lineage in the genealogy section, but few people would even know to check it. Otherwise, a great deal of information is provided in a nice format.	2002-09-23

Yes, this is a book for men, but it is a must-read (!) book for men. If you have a hard time being the man that God wants you to be, you should read this book.

My favorite book of the Bible is 1 Corinthians, so my opinion is highly biased. Still, after getting the full set, the first I went through is 1 Corinthians. It is good and up-to-date. There are many details filled in from a Reformed perspective. In some areas he disagrees with Hendrickson, but in a slight way (similar to how Supreme Court rulings disagree with previous Supreme Court rulings without contradicting them). This incorporates many of the investigations into Scripture of the past 30 years or so. Get the full set. If you cannot get the full set, get this volume.	2002-09-09

I think the comparison is pretty accurate. Both have enough detail of what tournament life is like. I think WF has more cases, but that makes PN a quicker read. PN was easy and quick reading, but still entertaining. It paints a slightly gloomier picture of professional poker than do \\"Big Deal\\" or \\"Biggest Game in Town\\", but I think it is more realistic.

Before turning away, keep in mind that I have used many other sets from libraries (public, academic and church) as well as from other Christians. My beliefs are strongly Reformed (Christian Reformed Church), so this set is one of the few that very closely fit with my beliefs. My prior favorite was the \\"Interpreter's Bible\\" set, which has recently been updated (I was using the older versions from local public libraries). Now, this set is my favorite.<br />The format between the two authors is very similar, intentionally, but I still prefer the newer format (slight improvements in keeping a flowing reading). The text has clearly been proofread very well.<br />As for content, I prefer Kistemaker's presentation. Part of that may be due to the fact that most of his books are later than Hendrickson's. The changes in society values does not have much impact for me, but the amount of biblical knowledge unearthed in the past 50 years is astounding. However, the impact is mostly felt in just a few chapters, so don't let that deter you. I compiled the list of books with information on book, year, author, and approximate length:<br />Matthew,1973,Hendricksen,1015<BR>Mark,1975,Hendricksen,700<BR>Luke,1978,Hendricksen,1122<BR>John,1953,Hendricksen,507<BR>Acts,1990,Kistemaker,1010<BR>Romans,1981,Hendricksen,533<BR>1 Corinthians,1993,Kistemaker,649<BR>2 Corinthians,1997,Kistemaker,495<BR>Galatians,1968,Hendricksen,260<br />Ephesians,1967,Hendricksen,290<BR>Philippians,1962,Hendricksen,218<BR>Colossians,1964,Hendricksen,208<BR>1 Thessalonians,1955,Hendricksen,150<BR>2 Thessalonians,1955,Hendricksen,214<BR>1 Timothy,1957,Hendricksen,215<BR>2 Timothy,1957,Hendricksen,117<BR>Titus,1957,Hendricksen,70<BR>Philemon,1964,Hendricksen,35<BR>Hebrews,1984,Kistemaker,460<BR>James,1986,Kistemaker,190<BR>1-3 John,1986,Kistemaker,235<BR>1-2 Peter,1987,Kistemaker,348<BR>Jude,1987,Kistemaker,70<BR>Revelation,2001,Kistemaker,635<br />My priorities were 1 Corinthians, Romans, Galatians and Ephesians. The 1 Corinthians volume won an award and it was warranted. Revelation is also appealing, especially from a Reformed perspective, and it also won an award.	2002-09-06

It is a first-hand account which gives it a great deal of credibility. The story winds through the author's year with an even amount of detail of items pertinent to the game and to life in general. I particularly liked the tidbits of (life) wisdom strewn throughout the book -- something that modern books are displaying less and less of (no one wants to give advice to anyone else on how the good life can be lived). The book ends with a whimper, compared to many modern life-and-death ultradramas, but it is more true-to-life and we mere mortals.	2002-08-20

I was expecting a book that had many chapters dealing with their travels across the states. Because it is not, I would have given it 3 stars. However, even though I have several highpoint guides, this one is a welcome addition. I think the second edition of the Winger's book is still my favorite, but this one has some highpoints (pun intended). This book has more items for the family -- things to do in the area. It also has a good couple of chapters on the necessary preparations for highpointing. For that, I would give it 5 stars. However, some of the highpoints have very slim descriptions of the actual hike. For that, I give it 4 stars. Overall, 4 stars.	2002-08-05

Time to brush up. This book is a retreat for road-worn warriors. Many good ideas (okay, not all of us will give up our productive IDE habits). Good presentation. I like the exercises along with the answers in the back. I especially like how the answers are presented. Typically, it is just the answers. This book has both the questions AND the answers in the back. No need to flip back and forth. Also, it is harder to get the answer to the next question by accident (typically if it is just answers, my eyes wander to the next answer).<br />The only complaints I have are the cover. First, it curls too easily. After reading first 20 pages, had permanent curl to it. Second, the color/material is grease prone. I take good care of my books (I often sell after reading once and the buyers swear they are in mint condition). However, after that same 20 pages, the cover had fingerprints and smears on it. It may be due to the dark charcoal color. Probably more due to poor materials. So, buy it, read it, keep it on your bookshelf.	2002-08-03

Having been in this field for 18 years (many languages and platforms), I expected a lot from this book. Maybe too much. The first part, where the author tells about story after story of misery, is easily shared by anyone in the field long enough. I expected a follow-up showing how to fix it. It looked promising in the discussion about looking at things from other points-of-view. However, it never got in any depth. Instead, it jumped off into simple project management that might be handy for a first-time project or technical lead -- not going in-depth like I expected. I guess I would still buy it again, but maybe not. Hence, four stars.	2002-07-23

It outlines how we have gotten away from being Godly and have become focused on growth and other worldly ideals. There is much to cover and, yes, some of it is hard to digest.

Actually, my copy of the Institutes was looking ragged, so now I use an electronic copy. Still, for a good understanding of Reformed theology, you should have both of these. It is nice, in the new compilation, to have both the &quot;Introduction&quot; and &quot;Systematic Theology&quot;. I agree that you need both publications and having them in one volume is handy.<br />I agree about the binding. It is sturdy enough (5 stars), but it is not &quot;user friendly&quot; (3 stars). The text nearly runs into the binding and its smaller size makes it hard to hold without it closing on itself. This makes it tough to read, holding it in hand while eating lunch. Still, the theological presentation is more important, so I give it 5 stars.	2002-05-20

I had looked at LLC options, but some clients require incorporating, so that was ruled out. My best route seemed to be S-Corp. This book answered most of my questions. The &quot;Incorporating Your Business, for Dummies&quot; was pretty good, but not as good as this book. This book has a lot of details and laid some of my worries to rest. It will also save money with your professional team (attorney, accountant) by answering simple, but essential, questions. Definitely worth the money.	2002-05-05

Of course, you should read &quot;Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom&quot; before this book. If you have not, though, it should be the next book on your list. This book provides many insights into the day-to-day electronic trading habits of good traders. This is the kind of information that could cost thousands and take months, if not years, to acquire -- it's no wonder some people ask why they were giving so much information away.	2002-03-18

Since I already had a great deal of experience with serial ports, most of this was not new to me. However, instead of having to train some colleagues on all the details, I recommended they buy this book. They did and it made them very proficient with serial ports. They kept the books.	2002-03-04

We hear that expression a lot, but this book is just that. At current prices, that would be about $6,200. It will save (i.e., make) me at least that much.<br />The book is probably worth most to intermediate level traders, although it will certainly help all traders. I say intermediate because they will have enough experience to appreciate the methodologies presented. Too many traders lose money because they are not prepared. This book helps prepare you for the hard choices (not merely finding a system for when to enter trades).<br />Using money management (position sizing) is a must. When you start implementing that, as presented in the book, you will sleep much better at night.<br />The sections on R, R-multiples and expectancy are worth the purchase. But, continue through the book and you will fall in love with it. I bet you will read it at least twice!<br />Of the hundreds of investing books that I have read, this is first or second on my list of favorites.	2002-03-04

Still, Nison's book has more meat and more material.<br />One thing that Morris' book has is data on comparing the different candlestick patterns. Unfortunately, it is so dependent on the stocks chosen that the reliability can be misleading.<br />After all that, since you will probably be putting significant funds behind your trades, buy both books!	2002-02-16

This book is the best book on the market (the 2001 edition). It covers the bases and gives good insights into the psychology (which is why TA is feasible). This will not replace &quot;Western&quot; TA, but is to be used in addition to it. However, candlesticks give you so much visual information, I guarantee you will switch your default view from bar charts to candlesticks. Read this book!	2002-02-13

Not a glitzy one, but one that the users will appreciate.  This is one of only two books on Web design that I recommend (I have read dozens).  This is not some doctoral tome with tons of pictures (it does have many good pictures, but they are useful ones).  This is not the latest full-page flash artist scheme.

No, that is not an offer, but if you were to pay a consultant for this good advice, it would easily cost hundreds of dollars (I know, I am a consultant).  The advice is good and concise.

This book was recommended to me by a church member who also was in Special Ops.  He says that the author is dead-on.  The advice is usable by all Christians and reminds us to stand firm in our faith and be prepared for the weapons of the Evil One.  Recommended for men and women, late teens through adult.	2002-01-10

Just today, I had to look up some information on factoring and remembered what a great book it is -- so I am leaving a review here.

This fit the bill.  Our cover looks slightly different (e.g., &quot;DK&quot; instead of &quot;Darling Kindersley&quot;), but it is the same ISBN.  I looked at ALL the appropriate dictionaries, probably 40 in total, and this was the best.  There are 5,000 main entries (related words bring the total to 12,000 words), including most of the ones that our child uses in class -- he wanted to make sure they were there.  The alphabet runs down each page with the current letter highlighted in color.  Each word tells what type it is (noun, adverb, etc.), but it is unobtrusive.  There are 2,500 pictures, which many of them being incredibly descriptive -- good pictures for words like &quot;lose&quot;, &quot;guess&quot;, &quot;shrug&quot;, &quot;zigzag&quot;.  Many of the words not only have the definitions, but a sample sentence that uses the word clearly.  This is definitely a best-buy for our second-grader.	2001-09-09

The online PDF file was a little more help.

Unfortunately, it often is only in the numerical aspect.  This book focuses on the spiritual aspect.  Communication with God, via prayer, is of utmost importance.<br />Cymbala shows how his church grew, because they had the right motives.  This is common among larger churches that have staying power.  Others are here one year, gone the next.  They focus on people and programs.  Cymbala points out the fallacy in that.  He also points out that praying is not to become the next &quot;program&quot;.  Get right with God and the rest won't matter.	2001-07-30

There is very little overlap between them, so I suggest getting both if you are reading them on your own.  If you are part of a group study, you can get by without the leader's guide.  For example, the student manual mentions two schools of thought about spiritual gifts: cessationist (some or all of the gifts applied only during the apostolic era) and non-cessationist (they apply today as well).  The leader's guide goes on to say that there is no biblical reason to believe that any of the spiritual gifts have ceased.	2001-07-26

Before purchasing any books, try all the free online tests that will give you a feel for what is available.  Peruse some of the other books on the subject, then buy this one.  It is the best -- concise information with biblical references and also suitable for a bible study environment.<br />I would recommend that you get the Leader's Guide as well, because there are a few things that are covered in the Leader's Guide that are not in the Student Manual.  For example, on the issue of whether some spiritual gifts have ceased, the Student Manual presents the two different schools of thought.  The Leader's Guide goes further and says that there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that any of the spiritual gifts have ceased.  By the way, this is also in agreement with the CRC's current standing regarding spiritual gifts.	2001-07-12

Unfortunately, too many people want the quick-fix and something easy to look at.  This is not to say that all of McDowell's &quot;verdicts&quot; are wrong, but some are.  People should think twice when a person is defending this book instead of defending from the Bible itself.  Unfortunately, of the readers that I know, many of them do not have a strong biblical background.  This is an easy way out for them.  As a result, it has often led to disputes within churches that should not have occurred (our denomination is very scholarly and clear on most positions).  For that, I would have given zero stars, but there are some points that it may benefit new Christians.	2001-07-10

Some have turned into good movies (&quot;Andromeda Strain&quot;, &quot;Jurrasic Park&quot;) but some books were much better than the movie (&quot;Sphere&quot;).  This book is promising for a contemporary movie which can make good use of special effects (ala &quot;The Abyss&quot; and &quot;The Matrix&quot;).<br />This book brought 14th century history alive.  I am not a big fan of history books, primarily because most of them are so dry.  This book is not.  It also does not &quot;glorify&quot; the past -- people often want the past to include flush toilets, air conditioning, electric light and manure-free streets.

A retired military man provides an involving recount of his AT hike.  I have tried to read many books on the AT (some were unbearable, so I did not finish them).  This was one of the few full-reads, and a good one at that.  In comparison to all other books, I might give this a four-stars rating, but seeing how bad some of the competition is, I have to give it a five-stars rating.  See you on the trails!	2001-04-06
2043145:US	52976583	R2KES50JJRSTRO	0963634291	913019576	The Thru-hiker's Handbook (Georgia to Maine 2001): #1 Guide for Long-Distance Hikes on the Appalachian Trail	Books	5	27	27	N	N	Better Than The Data Book	This book is about the same size as the &quot;AT Data Book&quot; but has a lot more information.  Has the usual information like mountains, shelters, mail drops, but includes small maps of towns with places to eat, get food, sleep, etc.  Also, instead of just saying &quot;w&quot; for water-is-available, usually indicates where it is.  For example, it might be 1) &quot;to the left 150 feet&quot;; 2) &quot;off the AT about 0.1 mile, not visible from Trail; watch for tiny sign on a tree.  Water is quite a way down from the shelter, but cold and dependable&quot; or 3) &quot;off the AT on 0.3 side trail to the left, tent platforms nearby, water source is spring&quot;.  That kind of detail can make a difference when you are planning your hike for the next day.	2001-04-06

In person, Van Till is one of the most committed physicists and christians that I know.  He takes a substantial amount of talent, integrity and faith and spreads the light for all.  The Christian world has given him mixed reviews because many of them are strict \\"six day\\" creationists, which Van Till is not.  You will be hard pressed to question his physics and he shows the flaws in many simple-faith approaches.  I have read dozens of books on creation and cosmology -- this is one of the best.	2001-03-07
2081285:US	52976583	R3GG90MIAOHWXL	1882577655	16298732	Climate of Fear: Why We Shouldn't Worry about Global Warming	Books	4	31	48	N	N	Ignore The Alarmists -- Find Out For Yourself	I have been following &quot;global warming&quot; for over 15 years and am dismayed by alarmists who have very little regard for real science.  Most of them, like some previous reviewers of this book, are merely jumping on a (popular) bandwagon -- they have done very little research themselves.<br />The least accurate studies (ground-based and ocean-based) are showing mixed (!) results, with the majority supporting slight warming.  By the way, have you noticed how they keep REDUCING their projections?  Maybe in 20 years, they will have reduced their projections enough that they match reality.<br />The next most accurate are weather balloon studies, which do not show warming.  This data is referred to less often than the other groups.<br />The most accurate are satellite studies which actually show cooling.  Yes, COOLING.  You'll notice that the alarmists ignore that data.  They will say something like, well look at all this other data.  So?  Who cares how much data you have if all of it is junk?<br />Some say that resource-wasting corporations are behind the non-global-warming data.  Not quite, but let's allow that for the moment.  Who is behind the global-warming data?  Government programs who want to stay alive (i.e., receive funding) and tell their researchers to find global warming (or they get shut down).  Guess what.  They &quot;find&quot; global warming.  Sounds like the pot calling the kettle black.<br />This book provides a different perspective -- maybe global warming will be good for us.  Some enticing theories, but I'm not sure I buy them (still doing more research).  I gave the book 4 stars because of a lack of substantial data, but would give it 5 stars for presentation and concept.	2001-03-04

This was the one I bought with my own money, and it was not required for a college course.  I had taken some economics courses some time ago and have a strong basis in math and statistics.  I checked with many professors and experts in economics, and this was the final selection.  Good coverage, exposing old and new ideas, many modern day REAL examples.  A keeper.	2001-02-13

I had heard good reviews from local christians, but the book was much more simplistic and less enlightening than I had expected.  The ideas are simple, but he repeats them often enough to have the ideas sink in.  For some, this may seem like manna.  I was looking for more substance.	2001-02-13

For readability, I would give it 3 or 4 stars, but for accuracy, it would get negative stars.  Hence, my 1 star rating.	2001-02-02

I have read or skimmed most of them.  This one requires more reading, in terms of volume, but it also delivers a better sense of his thoughts / actions and gives a better idea of how to implement it for yourself.	2000-10-19

I was looking for an atlas that would provide a good amount of information to get the &quot;big  picture&quot; of countries.  This one does it for me.  The only other one I  was considering (from The Economist) was not in stock.  In retrospect, this  might be better.  Well, we'll call it a tie.	2000-09-03

It covers many aspects of finance, but realizes that the main aspect is psychological.   No, it is not a psychology treatise, but it helps point in the right  directions.  The author has been in the same position that many of his  readers are.  Take a look at it.  You can probably find a copy at your  local library or via inter-library loan.	2000-03-16

This is likely the best non-fiction book I have read.  Of course, it requires an open and receptive mind, but the financial education is worth its weight in gold.  If you have had generations of paycheck-to-paycheck  income, you absolutely must read this book.  You will understand what you  knew all along, but were afraid to live it.	2000-01-26

This is the third book that I would recommend, but best in its class.  The first would be &quot;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&quot;.  The second would be &quot;Cashflow Quadrant&quot;.  Both are by Robert Kiyosaki.  Then, read  this book.  You will be well on your way to retirement, perhaps earlier  than you think!  Not a get-rich-quick book, but a  get-rich-as-soon-as-possible.	2000-01-23

This book is excellent for new or prospective computer consultants.  Ignore a lot of the negatives in an early chapter -- unless you haven't thought of any of them yourself.  Nearly worth its weight in gold.  Not  that it is the best book you'll ever read but that it will save / make you  that much money from reading it.	1999-08-20

I use the CT-MA-RI book to scope out which trails would be good for hiking with my 5 year old son.  We have done about 8 of the 79 so far.  Each one had accurate  descriptions and good indicators for difficulty.  Highly recommended.	1999-04-28

Actually, I gave two copies of this book, and probably will give  more.  There are many books that I praise and/or recommend, but only the  best ones are given.<br />The reader must be somewhat open-minded, but what  student or practitioner in the &quot;hard&quot; sciences doesn't need to be  that way?<br />A definite recommendation.	1998-09-24
