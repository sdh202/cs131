In consequence he's peppered his sequel with references to e.g. Ludwig von Mises and Carl Menger. In fact, at several points (notably the definition of the 'money supply'), LoCascio now relies on specifically Austrian insights.<br /><br />The essential proposition here is that the jiggery-pokery currently performed by the 'monetary elite' (which LoCascio explained in _Special Privilege_ and explains here in even more depth) would be impossible in a monetary system in which the 'dollar' was defined as a certain weight of gold and banks didn't enjoy special legal protection. There's nothing magical about gold, of course; it's just one of several metals that have always emerged as media of exchange whenever free markets have been allowed to work. Strictly speaking, a properly managed paper currency would do the job just as well. But paper currency doesn't carry any powerful incentive to proper management; in terms of 'honest discipline,' gold's got it all over the fiat currency we use now.<br /><br />As in LoCascio's earlier book, the 'special privilege' of the banking elite under current U.S. law is sixfold: the power to create money out of thin air; special protection of assets; liability protection; bailout schemes; funny accounting; and secrecy. These privileges combine to create and protect a monetary cartel that, even when it's working 'correctly,' tends to foster heavy inflation (in 1970 this book would have listed for about one-tenth of its current price), and moreover is rife with opportunities for fraud.<br /><br />LoCascio's explanations of these problems are clear and lucid; moreover, his history of the fractional reserve banking system probably has some new things to offer even those who are already fairly well-read on this subject. In short, it's a well-written and well-argued book that could succeed in taking this argument to a wider audience. And since there's probably a whole new generation out there who isn't yet familiar with the gold standard and the reasons for returning to it, LoCascio's book could also be a 'gateway' to the earlier literature on this subject.<br /><br />(By the way, something went wrong with the page numbering in the table of contents; by the end of the book, the TOC is off by three pages.

Heinlein works. It's not; in fact it's refreshingly original, and you certainly don't have to be a Heinlein fan (or even to have read Heinlein) in order to enjoy and appreciate it. But as Scalzi himself remarks in his acknowledgements, the influence _is_ fairly obvious.<br /><br />At any rate, I really like the book -- and on its own merits, not just because it reminds me of Heinlein. (Nor is it just because the hero, John Nicholas Perry, hails from the county seat of Darke County in my home state of Ohio, where Scalzi now lives.) Scalzi is a fine writer and his ideas sparkle off the page.<br /><br />I won't spoil anything for you; just keep your eyes peeled for at least one really cool idea every three or four pages. (And if Scalzi hasn't blown your mind within the first couple hundred pages, it'll happen when Alan Rosenthal explains how the skip drive works.) I can't really tell you anything specific without giving away something better left for you to discover as you read.<br /><br />I can say in general, though, that Scalzi has a pretty healthy sense of what it will take for human beings to colonize other planets in a universe that contains other sentient species. (And I think he has a better appreciation of moral ambiguity than Heinlein did even on his best day.) He's also got a knack for thinking up clever and gruesome ways for people to die. Oh, and there's a lot of nicely handled bittersweet stuff that may bring tears to your eyes if you're inclined to that sort of thing.<br /><br />All in all, a fine first novel; I'll look forward to reading his next (_Agent to the Stars_) as well as what appears to be a sequel currently in the works (_The Ghost Brigades_). And welcome to Ohio, John.	2005-08-09

Morgan's third novel was published in the U.K. about a year before it was available in the U.S. I awaited it eagerly. Oh, I was a bit worried because it's not a Takeshi Kovacs novel -- but it turns out that I needn't have been concerned.<br /><br />The backdrop of this comparatively near-future tale owes a lot (as Morgan himself tells us in his Acknowledgements) to _Mad Max_ and _Rollerball_. In fact the tone of the whole thing is rather like a screenplay or a graphic novel (and it's probably not a coincidence that Morgan has also written a series of Black Widow comics for Marvel). But hoo-boy, it's a good 'un.<br /><br />Yuppie road warrior ('Blaaaaade runner -- coyote's after you . . . ') Chris Faulkner is the hero(?) this time out. He's just recently joined the Conflict Investments division of Shorn Associates, see . . .<br /><br />But enough. You can read the other reviews and the Amazon summary if you want to know more. Better yet, you can read the book.<br /><br />Other reviewers are correct: this one may take you a bit longer to get into than Morgan's previous two books. But keep going; it's worth the wait. (Actually I didn't find the first portion hard to get through, but I can understand why some readers might, especially after Morgan's first two constant slam-bang page-turners.) It's got the trademark Morgan oomph, as well as his wicked sense of humor; for example, Morgan's own _Altered Carbon_ makes an uncredited cameo appearance near the end. (And a paradoxical one if this is, as it appears to be, Takeshi Kovacs's own universe. Or isn't Shorn Associates a corporate ancestor of Shorn Biotech? [Later note: Morgan says it's not; he just likes to reuse the name 'Shorn'.])<br /><br />Although it's fiction, it's got a bit of an agenda: a short bibliography lists works by e.g. Noam Chomsky and John Pilger. If you're not a fan of that crowd, don't let it put you off; Morgan is very good on this subject. (It may help pro-free-market readers to bear in mind that Morgan's target is corporate capitalism and Western-style globalization, not the happy fantasyland of the libertarian ideal. Indeed, Morgan has a keen sense of just exactly why multinational corporations _don't_ want to export the \\"free market\\" to the Third World, although he doesn't put it in those terms. It may also help to recall that SF writers of a small-l libertarian bent -- e.g. Heinlein and James P. Hogan -- are every bit as critical of corporations as they are of governments. At any rate, it's not as though Morgan's earlier two novels are notable for their bright and cheery optimism about the future of corporatism.)<br /><br />It's timely, it's trenchant, it's well-written and well-plotted, it's got a disturbingly plausible vision of the future, and it's got plenty of the harda$$ed brutality we've come to know and love in Morgan's work (and even what I think are a couple of sly, oblique references to Chuck Palahniuk's _Fight Club_). In short, it's got Major Motion Picture written all over it -- which reminds me that Hollywood has optioned _Altered Carbon_, too, so let's wait and see what happens.<br /><br />In the meantime, we can look forward to _Woken Furies_, the new Takeshi Kovacs novel due out this fall. (It's already available in the U.K. and getting excellent reviews.)<br /><br />[Update: I see from the author's website that a film deal for _Market Forces_ has already been signed -- and that the book actually began life as a screenplay.

218305:US	52474360	RF8RDNIPZV7HR	0805074422	871647100	Freethinkers: A History of American Secularism	Books	4	11	11	N	N	A short history of American freethought	Susan Jacoby's history of freethought/secularism in the United States is important for two main reasons.<br /><br />First, it's a reminder of the fact that so many significant contributions to our 'national character' have come from freethinkers and secularists. Whenever possible, American history has tried to ignore its Tom Paines, Robert Green Ingersolls, and Elizabeth Cady Stantons; and -- when the contributions are too large to ignore -- to try to turn its (Deist) Tom Jeffersons and (skeptic) Abe Lincolns retroactively into devout Christians. Jacoby isn't going to let anyone get away with such nonsense.<br /><br />And second, it's an explanation of just why our Constitution calls for strict separation of church and state. Too many 'conservative' voices these days are trying to persuade us that the First Amendment wasn't all that radical; the truly revolutionary nature of our 'godless Constitution' is at risk of being flushed down the memory hole. Jacoby isn't about to allow _that_ to happen either, in this age of 'faith-based initiatives' and Ten Commandments cases.<br /><br />Her history is quite readable and for the most part well researched. However, I'm deducting a star for her account of Herbert Spencer, which is grossly inaccurate and consists largely of repetitions of popular mischaracterizations of his thought. (For example, the real Herbert Spencer was very much in favor of charity and philanthropy, and he was a Lamarckian rather than a Darwinist.) Otherwise, her history is a breath of fresh air in the current cultural atmosphere.<br /><br />Don't make the mistake of equating 'freethinkers' with 'atheists'. Quite a few freethinkers are indeed atheists or agnostics, but Jacoby is using the term in its traditional sense -- to include, for example, Deists, Unitarians, liberal Protestants, Quakers (especially Hicksites), members of unorthodox sects, liberal Jews, and generally anyone who forms religious/theological/philosophical beliefs without reliance on alleged supernatural revelation. ('Reason the only oracle of man', as Ethan Allen put it in the title of an undeservedly forgotten essay. And Jacoby is definitely on the side of 'reason' here; she gives no quarter to New Age nonsense.)<br /><br />Likewise, a 'secularist' here is one who does not believe in looking beyond the present world for the foundations of moral/ethical guidance, not necessarily one who rejects all belief in a possible afterlife. ('One world at a time', as Henry David Thoreau once famously rebuked a religious inquirer.)<br /><br />This isn't just a matter of word games; the fact that freethought and secularism include such a broad range of outlooks is crucial to understanding why current religious 'conservatives' are wrong to equate every historical reference to God with belief in orthodox Christianity. And this in turn bears on our interpretation of such founding documents as the Declaration of Independence -- which some conservative revisionists now want to read as a Christian document simply because (Deist) Thomas Jefferson makes reference therein to 'the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God'.<br /><br />This fine book is, then, both notable for its reclamation of a forgotten (or deliberately disclaimed) side of U.S. history, and crucial for its contribution to current debates about the meaning and scope of the First Amendment.<br /><br />Indeed, on the latter issue my main criticism is that Jacoby occasionally doesn't go far _enough_. For example, I think there are excellent grounds for believing that the Fourteenth Amendment was originally supposed to bind the state governments to the _entire_ Bill of Rights but was eviscerated by the Supreme Court in the Slaughter-House Cases, a problem which led in turn to the proposal of the (rejected) Blaine Amendment. Jacoby doesn't touch on this possibility and writes as though the Blaine Amendment was the first attempt to apply the First Amendment to state governments since Madison's rejected proposalat the Constitutional Convention.<br /><br />Well done, though, and (except for the few pages on Spencer) clearly the result of careful thought and study. Highly recommended.cept for the few pages on Spencer) clearly the result of careful thought and study. Highly recommended.	2005-06-03

Probably no one anywhere seriously contends as a matter of principle that e.g. judges should render strictly subjective opinions. But in practice, one person's law is another person's bias. (And contrary to the rhetoric of the loudest voices in such debates, it's usually because there are two competing principles genuinely at issue, not because one side doesn't care about principles at all.)<br /><br />So it's a good idea to take a step back and ask, a bit more abstractly, exactly what we mean by the 'rule of law'. And that's where this slim but information-dense volume comes in.<br /><br />Brian Tamanaha takes just about the only course it's possible to take in defining such a nebulous concept: the historical approach. By way of putting salt on the tail of the ideal of the rule of law, he traces the development of the concept from ancient Greece to the present day.<br /><br />If you think that sounds like a big job for just 141 pages of text (plus notes and bibliography), you're right. In fact, one of the most impressive things about this deceptively small book is the amount of erudition Tamanaha manages to pack economically into its pages. There's quite a lot buried between the lines here, and sweating this baby down to such a manageable length (while keeping it readable) must have taken some real editing.<br /><br />For it _is_ eminently readable, and it does provide a thorough, if brief, tour of the development of the rule-of-law ideal in Western civilization.<br /><br />The tour begins, naturally enough, in ancient Greece and Rome, since the ideal at least has its roots in, most notably, the writings of Plato and Aristotle. However, as Tamanaha points out, these writings didn't directly embody the ideal and in any event were largely lost to the West until medieval times; their importance for the rule of law was largely in their influence on later thinkers.<br /><br />It's in the Middle Ages that things really get rolling, what with all the power struggles between the papacy and the various thrones, the development of German customary law, and the Magna Carta. Even here, as Tamanaha shows, the ideal hasn't come to full fruition; what happens at this stage is that we're bequeathed a difficult question about how the government -- the state, the monarch, the legislature, the sovereign -- can be bound by the law when it is itself apparently the source of that law.<br /><br />Tamanaha traces the ramifications of this question, and its developing answers, through the rise of the middle class, the Enlightenment, the growth of capitalism, and the modern era -- significantly and properly locating the rule-of-law ideal in the rise of political liberalism (in its broadest sense). Along the way we get short and incisive summaries of e.g. the works of Locke, Montesquieu, and Hamilton, Madison, and Jay, and a fine (and scrupulously fair) overview of the recent history and current state of the debate.<br /><br />In the end we wind up with a broad tripartite account of the meaning of the rule of law. The three essential themes, Tamanaha contends, are the limitation of government itself by law, the 'formal' requirement that law be both impersonal and predictable, and the contrast between the 'rule of law' and the 'rule of man'. Having distinguished these themes, Tamanaha spends a chapter considering their application to international law, and then closes with a short rumination on whether the rule of law is really a 'universal human good'.<br /><br />Ultimately Tamanaha finds grounds for optimism in the fact that pretty much everyone, no matter what their other disagreements, gives at least lip service to the rule-of-law ideal. This fact, though disconcertingly negative as to the prospectsfor agreement about precisely what the rule of law means in detail, is also evidence that societal attitudes broadly favoring the rule of law are deeply embedded and not likely to be dislodged by those narrower disputes.<br /><br />It would be hard to find a more timely subject than Tamanaha's, and it would be hard to find a fairer or more readable discussion than his. If you're interested in current debates about the independence of the judiciary and the role of judges, don't miss this opportunity to stand back from those debates and look at the big picture. Public discourse is better served by a little history than by a lot of rhetoric.dence that societal attitudes broadly favoring the rule of law are deeply embedded and not likely to be dislodged by those narrower disputes.

Hardly	Is the federal judiciary really out of control?<br /><br />By way of answer to that question, Mark Kozlowski delivers 220 pages (plus endnotes) of fresh air and good sense -- all pointing to the conclusion that, nope, the federal judiciary is doing pretty much what it's always done and working pretty much the way the framers of the Constitution intended it to work.<br /><br />It's a nice analysis. In his opening chapter, he sets out an eminently fair statement of what he calls the 'Imperial Judiciary thesis' (propounded most recently in Mark Levin's ill-reasoned screed _Men In Black_ -- endorsed, notably, by Ed Meese). In the rest of the book, he proceeds to make complete mincemeat of it. 'Originalism' (both the 200-proof Bork/Meese variety and the 100-proof version offered by Keith Whittington) get a pretty complete takedown -- along with, really, the entire Levin/Bork/Meese view of the Constitutional role of the judiciary.<br /><br />I won't try to summarize Kozlowski's arguments here; I'll just recommend them highly to anyone looking for a sane voice in reply to the current round of anti-judiciary fanatics. This is an excellent and well-reasoned book that, unfortunately, remains timely two years after its publication. I guess there are still some people who need to read it.	2005-05-20

But his opinion is based primarily on his unstated presumption that every occurrence of the word 'God' refers to 'Christianity' -- and also on his unstated presumption that documents like the Declaration of Independence have legal significance.<br /><br />They don't, and neither does the preamble of the Alabama state constitution (which says something about acknowledging God). As ex-Judge Moore should know full well, courts don't base law on constitutional preambles. And as he also should know, nothing in the Alabama constitution gives the chief justice _any_ power to engage in religious expression as part of his official duties, nor would the federal Constitution allow such a delegation of power to stand anyway. And yet this guy deliberately put up a monument deliberately intended to convey and reinforce his claim that the laws of our land are based on Christianity, and to this day paints himself as a martyr for having been ordered to take it down and removed from office for his refusal to obey a federal court order.<br /><br />Well, there's a huge difference between being 'forced to deny God' and being told that you can't use the rotunda of the state Supreme Court building as your own personal pulpit. If you can tell these two things apart already, the main thing you'll learn from this book is something about the outlook of someone who can't. In other words, you'll get some insight into the way the mind of a theocrat works.<br /><br />That's actually a helpful thing, because -- as a direct result of cases like Moore's -- _other_ theocrats are out there trying to strip the federal judiciary of its authority to rule on cases involving public officials' 'acknowledgements of God'. (At the time I write this, both the House and the Senate are considering bills to do exactly that.)<br /><br />So if you have any interest in retaining your hard-won Constitutional freedoms and in not undoing a half-century and more of Supreme Court rulings on the First Amendment, this is probably a good book to skim through at least once. At the very least, it will help you understand the mindset of the people who want to strip you of those freedoms.<br /><br />And if you know anything about Constitutional law, it might also give you a few good laughs.

This is it.<br /><br />There are lots of books out there making the argument that recognition of same-sex marriage is a good idea. This is one of very few devoted solely to the case that the Constitution _requires_ such recognition. And it's very well-reasoned.<br /><br />This book was being prepared for publication as _Lawrence v. Texas_ was decided, so you might think it would be outdated. But it isn't; that decision reinforces Gerstmann's analysis almost point by point.<br /><br />I say 'almost' because _Lawrence_ was decided under the Due Process Clause, whereas Gerstmann thinks that fundamental rights are better regarded as founded in the Equal Protection Clause. (I disagree with him there, by the way, and I also wonder why he doesn't consider the Privileges and Immunities Clause. On the other hand, he gets extra credit for favorably considering the Ninth Amendment.)<br /><br />But in the end it doesn't matter, because Gerstmann's argument is firmly grounded in the fact that the Supreme Court has long recognized the right to marry as a fundamental right. (Where that right is 'located' in the Constitution is a separate and subsidiary question.) This fundamental-right approach yields, on Gerstmann's view (and mine), a much more tenable analysis than the more common equal-protection approach. (And of course _Lawrence_ relied on a liberty-rights analysis in striking down state anti-'sodomy' laws -- which is why Gerstmann's analysis gets a fresh boost from that landmark decision.)<br /><br />There are lots of other analytical treats throughout. For example, Gerstmann devotes the better part of a chapter to an argument that _Loving v. Virginia_ doesn't really provide a good analogy to same-sex marriage. He faces head-on the problems associated with judicial 'creation' of rights and offers a four-point pragmatic test for when it's okay. And he dismantles 'original intent'-based Constitutional interpretation by taking on the most capable and nuanced of its defenders.<br /><br />(He also does a bang-up job setting out all the things that are _wrong_ with reliance on current Equal Protection jurisprudence. That won't surprise readers of Gerstmann's earlier book, _The Constitutional Underclass_, which I also highly recommend.)<br /><br />But the best (and most important) part by far is the analysis of the right to marry as a fundamental right that encompasses same-sex marriage. This portion of Gerstmann's analysis should _gain_ in importance as post-_Lawrence_ courts address the Constitutionality of same-sex marriage bans. (And so should his argument that proponents of same-sex marriage should hold out for full-blown _marriage_ rather than, as William Eskridge has counselled, be at least temporarily satisfied with 'domestic partnerships' or 'civil unions'.)<br /><br />My own opinion is that recognition of same-sex civil marriages is indeed required under the Constitution -- and since I held that opinion before reading Gerstmann's book, I may not be a good test of his persuasiveness. (I'm also a lawyer, so I can't tell you how 'readable' the book will be for non-lawyers.) But I find Gerstmann's argument cogent and, for the most part, right on the money.by taking on the most capable and nuanced of its defenders.

Throw in the action sequences from _Commando_, _True Lies_, and _Eraser_, and the world-domination plots of your five favorite James Bond films. Then give it six cups of coffee and a steroid injection.<br /><br />This book has all the stuff you want in a great adventure: a precious Incan idol, a four-hundred-year-old manuscript (with its own adventure tale), caimans, giant black cats, Nazis on jet skis, and a secret weapon that could destroy the earth. There are reluctant heroes, countdowns to doom, cliffhangers, fistfights on conveyor belts, daring rescues, hairbreadth escapes, lots of corpses (including some with exploded heads), many levels of treachery and double-dealing, and a sentence that begins, 'Somehow, they had managed to get past the urine-soaked skulls'.<br /><br />It's wildly, delightfully, exuberantly implausible. And it's _great_ adventure.<br /><br />All I can tell you without spoiling anything is this: Will Race is a linguist, and some military types want to enlist his help on a secret project. Of course he agrees, at which point the adventure begins and never lets up until the very last page.<br /><br />If you start this book, be prepared not to do anything else for a while. And make sure you read it someplace where you won't be embarrassed to have people overhear you saying 'Nawwww!', 'Whoa!', 'No way!', and 'Yee-haw!'<br /><br />Way cool and lots of fun. Oh, and if you're one of those girlyboys who whines about 'character development' and $@#%! like that, you are most definitely looking at the wrong book.	2005-03-09

In this excellent work, Randy E. Barnett proposes a predominantly libertarian answer to that question. (I say 'predominantly' because Barnett is quite clear-eyed and honest in his recognition of the handful of nonlibertarian elements in the document.)<br /><br />Barnett initially addresses the question why we should consider ourselves bound by the Constitution at all, since the idea that it really speaks for every single one of 'the People' for all time is clearly a fiction. His answer will surprise everyone but libertarians: we should regard ourselves as bound by the Constitution because, insofar as, and so long as it is used to enact those laws that preserve and protect our liberty rights.<br /><br />On this foundation Barnett develops a theory of Constitutional interpretation based on 'original meaning' (carefully distinguished from 'original intent' as originally defended by Bork and Meese). The heart of his thesis is that, wherever possible, we ought to prefer a reading that comports with the public understanding of the Constitution at the time it was ratified (which may not, of course, be a precise match for the 'intent' of the framers). He has James Madison on his side here. (Of course a similar argument applies to the various Amendments as of the times _they_ were ratified, so Barnett's 'original meaning' isn't a haven for those who want to undo the Fourteenth Amendment.)<br /><br />Barnett then applies this interpretive approach to the judicial power in order to demonstrate that judicial review -- specifically including the power to nullify unconstitutional laws -- was part of the original understanding of this power. This chapter is quite well argued and, in my view, altogether conclusive on the issue. It's also, unfortunately, quite necessary, because there are people calling themselves 'conservatives' who seem to think judicial review was conjured out of the ether in _Marbury v. Madison_ (1803). (Mark Levin's recent _Men In Black_, for example, is hopelessly muddled on this issue, as Levin fails to distinguish carefully among judicial review, a judicial veto, and judicial supremacy. See my review of that book for further criticism.)<br /><br />Having established that judicial review is part of the original Constitutional scheme (and part of the Constitutional meaning of 'due process'), Barnett then applies his original-meaning methodology to determine just how the Supreme Court ought to interpret various portions of the Constitution in reviewing the legitimacy of legislative enactments. The Necessary and Proper Clause turns out, on his analysis, to delegate to Congress only the power to enact legislation strictly requisite for the exercise of its enumerated powers ('necessary'), and only to the extent that such legislation does not infringe liberty rights ('proper'). The Fourteenth Amendment's Privileges or Immunities Clause turns out to bind state governments to the entire Bill of Rights. (See Michael Kent Curtis's excellent _No State Shall Abridge_ for a fine analysis that reaches the same conclusion.) And the Ninth Amendment turns out to protect all liberty rights of any kind, whether enumerated or not.<br /><br />Barnett is then able to arrive, in consequence, at his central thesis: the twentieth century's 'presumption of constitutionality' should be reversed, and the Supreme Court should conduct judicial review on the basis of a 'presumption of liberty'. Instead, that is, of presuming that (say) a piece of challenged Congressional legislation is Constitutional unless an opposing party can show otherwise, the initial burden should be on the government to show why such legislation _is_ 'necessary and proper'.<br /><br />Barnett then applies his analysis to the Commerce Clause and the police powers of the states, concluding that the scope of each is far narrower than recent jurisprudence allows. A closing chapter looks at a few 'hard cases' (though hardly, of course, an exhaustive list).<br /><br />The analysis is excellent throughout. As he did in _The Structure of Liberty_, Barnett has thrown down a gauntlet here and I can't imagine what a successful response might look like.<br /><br />There are minor points I could nitpick. (For example, Rep. John Bingham, drafter of the original version of the Fourteenth Amendment, was from Ohio, not -- as Barnett says on p. 193 -- New York.) The index could also use a lot of work; a random spot-check turns up a number of problems. (For example, a reference to Richard Epstein that actually appears on p. ix is indexed for page xi; Michael Kent Curtis appears on pages 61, 62, 108, 115, 203, and 348 but is indexed only for p. 61; some references -- e.g. to Henry Veatch, whose excellent _For An Ontology of Morals_ Barnett cites on p. 83 -- aren't indexed at all; and a reference to Murray Rothbard on p. 346 is indexed for p. 246. And yes, 'anal-retentive' _does_ take a hyphen; why do you ask?)<br /><br />More seriously, perhaps, I'd have liked to see a bit more analysis of 'hard cases' that are controversial even among those inclined toward libertarianism. Even on Barnett's understanding of the Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments (which I think is utterly correct), it's not clear that abortion falls within the scope of retained liberty rights (as the interests of another party are pretty obviously adversely affected). Even here, though, Barnett's analysis is of tremendous help in posing the question correctly, whatever one's views on the answer.<br /><br />It's a brilliant book from start to finish and it's probably the single best volume of Constitutional legal theory currently available; naturally there's lots of really cool stuff in it that I haven't even begun to summarize here. It's also a wonderful antidote to the spate of recent 'conservative' Court-bashing literature that persistently misidentifies the problems and tosses out the Constitutional baby with the bathwater.<br /><br />If the Constitution is of interest to you, don't miss this one. By the way, Barnett is also the coauthor of a brilliant _amicus curie_ brief submitted by the Institute for Justice in _Lawrence v. Texas_; look that up too.oughout.

Oh, the homage is there; he acknowledges both Heinlein and Haldeman, and he incorporates variations of themes not only from _Starship Troopers_ but also from _The Puppet Masters_. But he's not merely copying stuff others have done before him. On the contrary, it's almost impossible to write a novel in this genre _without_ incorporating many things that now seem 'cliche' because the original masters did such a memorable job of inventing them.<br /><br />You can gather from the other reviews everything you need to know about the plot. Jason Wander, as you'll learn within the first few pages, is a young man who lost his mother in a devastating attack by some aliens who seem to want to move onto our planet and hope to soften us up. He winds up serving in the infantry; we follow him through Basic Training and off to Ganymede, where the aliens have a base. (No doubt this will remind many readers of Juan Rico, but Wander is a different character entirely and he has his own voice altogether. In fact, his cynical smartassery recalls the best work of Keith Laumer.)<br /><br />An excellent, excellent work of post-9/11 military SF. Heinlein would have loved it.<br /><br />And three cheers to Fred Gambino for a magnificent piece of cover art.	2005-02-26

It's every bit as good as I anticipated.<br /><br />John G. Hemry continues to impress me, not only with the quality of his narrative prose (which purrs along like a well-designed engine), but with his remarkable ability to handle technical, physical, and legal details accurately without bogging down the story. This is fine stuff, and there's a lot of homework buried between the lines.<br /><br />The tale picks up shortly after the events of _Burden of Proof_. Lieutenant Junior Grade Paul Sinclair is now serving as Combat Information Center Officer on the U.S.S. _Michaelson_ (and still doing double duty as legal officer), and his sierra oscar Lieutenant Junior Grade Jen Shen is an engineer on the _Michaelson_'s sister ship, the _Maury_. There's a big multinational maneuver coming up, in which several nations are planning to show off a little bit to put the fear of God into the South Asian Alliance.<br /><br />As with the earlier two novels, reading the summary on the back cover will take you too far into the story. The blurb describes some events that don't happen until eighty or a hundred pages in, and at least one really dramatic scene loses some of its oomph because we know how one highly relevant portion of it is going to come out. So I'm not going to tell you any more about the plot, and I _am_ going to recommend that you try really really hard not to read the back cover before you've read the innards.<br /><br />Hemry continues to excel both at putting us inside the heads of these characters (and, indirectly, giving us lots of lessons about life in the present-day Navy) and at writing gripping scenes of space-navy action _and_ legal drama. All I can say without giving away plot details is that portions of this one are even better than the first two books in the series. (I guess I can mention that there's an absolutely hilarious Captain's Mast scene fairly early on, involving one Seaman Jacob.)<br /><br />This is turning out to be one of the very finest series in modern SF. If you've read the first two books, don't hesitate to grab this one as fast as you can. And if you haven't read any of them yet, it doesn't matter _too_ much where you start, but it's probably better to read them in order (_A Just Determination_, _Burden of Proof_, and this one)..)

Levin hasn't missed _everything_ of importance; he just hasn't assembled it into a cogent argument. (So it's really the 'method' that he's missed.) But he does have a keen eye for color, or at least for various shades of black.<br /><br />What he claims to be showing us in this book is that we have a runaway Supreme Court that, via 'judicial activism', is practicing 'judicial tyranny' and tearing the U.S. away from its Constitutional roots. What he actually shows is that the federal government has done some things Levin doesn't agree with.<br /><br />He begins by discussing four cases that, in his view, illustrate 'judicial activism' and what's wrong with it. It's unfortunate that he elects to present his argument in terms of 'judicial activism', and his illustrations -- selected with the entirety of U.S. judicial history to choose from -- really illustrate nothing more than the wonderful malleability of this vacuous term.<br /><br />One of the cases is _Plessy v. Ferguson_, in which the Supreme Court refrained from striking down (under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause) a state-level racial-segregation law. Okay, it was a bad decision -- but it amounts to 'judicial activism' the way sitting really still amounts to vigorous exercise. (Indeed, it was overturned by _Brown v. Board of Education_, which I'd regard as a pretty 'activist' decision -- and so would Levin, if it had involved a state law he _liked_.)<br /><br />Another of his selections is _Korematsu v. U.S._, the 1944 case in which the SCOTUS upheld the constitutionality of an executive order (issued by FDR) to relocate and intern people of Japanese descent. Whatever you think of the result, surely the problem Levin has with it is that is shows undue deference to the executive. Calling this 'judicial activism' sheds no real light and even obscures the fact that the order in question came not from the judiciary but from the executive branch.<br /><br />In this respect the example is typical of much of his argument. Given his focus, you'd expect his targets to be strictly judicial matters. Yet he devotes entire chapters to problems that touch only tangentially on the judiciary -- and therefore are far from showing 'How the Supreme Court [as opposed to, say, Congress] Is Destroying America'. (In fact he never gets around to showing us how _anybody_ is actually 'destroying America', so I guess that's just hyperbole for the sake of a catchy title.)<br /><br />For example, we get a full chapter on the McCain-Feingold Act, a campaign-contributions law that, on Levin's view, violates the First Amendment. Okay, I agree. But Congress passed it and President Bush signed it; all the SCOTUS did was refrain from striking it down out of (over-) deference to the other branches of the government. How is this an example specifically of a _judiciary_ run unconstitutionally amok?<br /><br />(By the way: since Levin also makes occasional derisive allusions to SCOTUS rulings that flag-burning constitutes 'speech', you might expect him to tackle that issue as well. But not only does he never analyze the flag-burning issue -- in which case he'd have had to point out that Justice Antonin Scalia regards flag-burning as protected speech -- he also never bothers telling us why campaign contributions _do_ constitute 'speech'.)<br /><br />Likewise, we've got a full chapter on the way the Interstate Commerce Clause has been stretched out of shape to give Congress authority over things you wouldn't ordinarily think of as interstate commerce. Again, the point is valid -- but it's really hard to see why this is an example of _judicial_ activism/tyranny, since it's Congress passing the laws and exercising the additional authority. (Indeed, in other contexts Levin regards it as 'judicial tyranny' for the SCOTUS to _limit_ what the state and federal legislatures can do.)<br /><br />Nor -- and quite surprisingly in this context -- does Levin see fit to mention _Lochner v. New York_ or the way an incredibly 'activist' SCOTUS used to strike down New Deal legislation as unconstitutional. _That_ 'judicial activism' stopped soon after FDR tried to increase the number of justices to fifteen and pack the Court with New Deal Democrats. Ironically, Levin remarks on FDR's court-packing plan in his closing chapter (apparently as an example of a _good_ way to rein in the Supreme Court) and never ties it in either to his discussion of economic regulation or to his discussion of _Korematsu_ (a decision issued by an extremely 'reined-in' Court).<br /><br />Even more incredibly, he spends a full chapter complaining about the allegedly extraconstitutional 'right to privacy' without ever once mentioning the Fourth Amendment or _Katz v. U.S._ -- the 1967 decision in which the Court (the same 'activist' Court that gave us _Griswold_) extended Fourth Amendment protection against 'unreasonable searches' to cover wiretapping. (In fact, the Fourth Amendment isn't mentioned anywhere in the entire book.) By his usual argument ('the Constitution doesn't mention electronic surveillance'), he _ought_ to favor a tremendous expansion of police power against our allegedly fictional 'right to privacy'. But I'll bet he doesn't (or else does and knows better than to say so to an audience of conservatives) -- and I'll bet that's why he doesn't bring it up.<br /><br />Problems like this pervade the book, even in its good parts. His quotations tend to be out of context and to fail to illustrate his points. For example, he quotes four sitting Justices in order to show that they are somehow relying on international law in their rulings. But his quotations show no such thing.<br /><br />Justice Anthony Kennedy refers to international law in _Lawrence v. Texas_ because the decision he was overruling (_Bowers v. Hardwick_, a decision Levin likes) had already done so in defense of state laws criminalizing 'sodomy'. Kennedy merely points out that, to whatever degree such matters are relevant at all, the _Bowers_ decision didn't include all pertinent examples. Then, too, we're supposed to be shocked, shocked, at Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's suggestion that U.S. courts might reasonably look to court decisions in other nations for (nonbinding) guidance under some circumstances. And omigosh, she thinks we might _especially_ have reason to do so if other nations adopt our Constitutional system and undertake their own deliberations about what e.g. 'due process' and 'equal protection' mean!<br /><br />Call me a raging leftie, but I'm going to go with (Republicans) Kennedy and O'Connor here. At any rate, neither quotation shows that either justice is making rulings based on international law. His quotations from Justices John Paul Stevens (also a Republican) and Ruth Bader Ginsburg (the only Democrat among his examples) don't show that they're doing so either, but I don't have room to discuss them here.<br /><br />Too often, Levin's treatment of legal issues is irremediably muddy. In one chapter, for example, he discusses the _Hamdi_ and _Rasul_ cases, dealing with the military's detaining of possible enemy combatants -- and never quite manages to get clear that the due-process right at issue is the right to due process on the question whether one is an 'enemy combatant' in the first place. Obviously this is an issue that distinguishes current cases from those in which a detainee is wearing, say, a German Army uniform; when you're detaining suspected terrorists, it can be hard to tell which ones are really innocent civilians. But Levin doesn't even recognize that this is an issue, and his arguments suffer for it. (Nor does Levin notice any inconsistency here with his opposition to _Korematsu_, in which a highlydeferent Court let the Roosevelt Administration do to Japanese-Americans approximately what the Bush Administration wanted to do to Messrs. Hamdi and Rasul. Apparently the Court is activist if they do and activist if they don't.)<br /><br />For a 'strict constructionist', he also seems unaccountably surprised that the SCOTUS interprets the word 'person' in the Fifth Amendment to mean person. He seems to be one of those folks who think that the U.S. Constitution applies only to citizens and that the government can, without Constitutional restriction, do whatever it pleases to everyone else. (Not that he bothers supporting this opinion; he just assumes it, and writes as though his readers are assuming it too.) But the Constitution 'applies' to the _government_ -- and restrains its powers with respect to _everyone's_ rights.<br /><br />Moreover, and in this context crucially, Levin continually blurs (and at times altogether eradicates) the distinction between (a) placing Constitutional limits on the laws the federal and state legislatures can make and (b) actually making laws. Time and again he accuses the SCOTUS of doing the latter when it's doing the former. And the former is its job, whether Levin likes it or not.<br /><br />It's hard to _tell_ whether he likes it or not. On the one hand, he thinks the power of judicial review, established once and for all (though hardly invented) in _Marbury v. Madison_ (1803), destroyed the delicate balance of powers the framers had in mind (a conclusion he reaches by failing to distinguish between a judicial veto as part of the legislative process -- which the framers did reject -- and judicial review of legislation already enacted, which they overwhelmingly approved). But somehow that doesn't keep him from excoriating supposedly 'activist' Courts for _not_ overturning unconstitutional legislation (or executive orders) by exercising the power he thinks they're not supposed to have.<br /><br />The result is an absolute mess of an argument that seems to go something like this: The Supreme Court is destroying America by failing to impose Constitutional limitations on the other branches of the government through the exercise of a power (judicial review) that the Constitution doesn't confer on it anyway -- except that in _some_ cases it _is_ imposing such limitations, and _that's_ how it's destroying America.<br /><br />What Levin probably means -- or would mean if he were reasoning clearly -- is that he wants the Court to interpret the Constitution more strictly (by his own not entirely consistent standard of strictness) when it exercises judicial review. But of course if he'd put it that way, he couldn't have tapped into the conservative Zeitgeist on the pseudo-issue of 'judicial activism' by blaming the current state of America on a rogue judiciary, let alone claimed that the power of judicial review itself was unconstitutional.<br /><br />These shortcomings are too bad, because there really is some worthwhile material in this book. The problem is that so much of it is polemic masquerading as legal scholarship. I like right-wing polemic; Ann Coulter is one of my favorites. But her polemic is clearly identified (or easily identifiable) _as_ polemic and she doesn't pretend to be 'scholarly' when she's dropping rhetorical bombshells. However, people can (and do) mistakenly read Levin's book as a balanced, educated look at the way the Supreme Court really operates.<br /><br />In fact, in its _analysis_, it's little more than pandering to the crowd that starts hollering, 'Those judicial activists are destroying America!' whenever the SCOTUS curbs federal and state governments' ability to restrict, infringe, or impose on personal liberty. (You know the ones. They carry on about the Constitution and states' rights as though these were their real issues, but they don't really give a damn about liberty; they want to pass laws restricting your private behavior, and they're mad because the SCOTUS won'tlet them. For these folks, 'judicial tyranny' is rightspeak for 'not letting _us_ be tyrants'.)<br /><br />_Men In Black_ is a near-total failure as an attack specifically on the Court, but it's not bad as a partial (in both senses of the word) overview of some questionable exercises/expansions of federal power. (And, for some readers, it will be a valuable illustration of some important differences between libertarians and conservatives.)

Monk, author of _The Bill of Rights: A User's Guide_, has done an amazingly fine job with this book. If you want a one-volume introduction to the Constitution of the United States, this is it. (As a lawyer I try to keep an eye out for books I can recommend to people who want to learn how U.S. law works. This one and Jay Feinman's _Law 101_ are two of the best.)<br /><br />In just over two hundred pages, Monk walks the reader through the text of the entire document (including the Bill of Rights), giving history, relevant cases, and an overview of competing interpretations. Sidebars present relevant quotations from, well, lots of people -- Charlton Heston on the Second Amendment, Ted Nugent on the importance of copyright, and tons of others. Monk makes her selections from across the political spectrum and she carefully refrains from taking sides herself. Terms that won't be familiar to the typical reader are defined in the margins.<br /><br />Despite what you may have heard, her presentation is neither 'liberal' nor 'revisionist'. (For example, her presentation on the Second Amendment is nicely handled; we hear from all sides, but Monk makes clear that a federal appellate court has held that the right to bear arms is unambiguously an _individual_ right.) In fact, she does remarkably well at presenting all major points of view on each issue within a very short space, and she doesn't slight anyone; any reviewer who thinks otherwise didn't read the book very carefully (if at all).<br /><br />Don't let the noise from the peanut gallery scare you off. People who don't want a 'living constitution' don't have a clue what it would be like to have a dead one. (For one thing, libertarians -- of whom I am one -- would be miserable. The police wouldn't need warrants to tap phone lines; electronic eavesdropping wasn't a 'search' until 1967, when _Katz v. U.S._ expanded the Fourth Amendment to protect us wherever and whenever we have a 'reasonable expectation of privacy'. And yes, that case is covered in here -- along with _Olmstead_, which it overruled, and _Kyllo_, which expands it to cover thermal imaging.)<br /><br />Highly recommended to anyone who wants to know what the Constitution says and means. And that should include all Americans -- even the ones who already have copies of the Cato Institute's Constitution and Declaration booklet.vered in here -- along with _Olmstead_, which it overruled, and _Kyllo_, which expands it to cover thermal imaging.)

They're more interested in their own moral opinion of themselves than they are in the actual well-being of the victims of their misguided 'beneficence'.<br /><br />(2) Their intentions aren't all that great anyway. Self-reliance and self-responsibility are a sound and reliable moral foundation for a stable social order; compassion and soft-heartedness are not.<br /><br />In order to substantiate these claims, Charen sorts through some thirty years' worth of 'social programs' drummed up by Sargent Shriver's Bleeding Hearts Club Band -- welfare, affirmative action, programs to deal with mental illness and homelessness, and so forth -- and points out just where and how they have failed. There isn't really any question that they _have_ failed, but if you require persuading on that point, Charen will oblige you.<br /><br />(She also clears up lots of mysteries in the left-liberal worldview. You may have wondered, for example, why people who have never had a good word to say about traditional families suddenly start slobbering about 'family preservation' when the subject of adoption comes up. It turns out that, in this context, by 'families' they mean 'crack-addicted single mothers and their boyfriends'.)<br /><br />I've got minor issues here and there. For example, I think there's some overkill in the blame-it-all-on-the-hippies department and some occasional silliness about the 'counterculture'. (Ken Kesey's _One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest_, though plausibly read as favoring some sort of reform of mental-health institutions, is hardly a manifesto for turning genuinely dangerous mental patients loose on the streets. In general, I think Charen resembles too many other current pop-conservative writers in failing to appreciate the real value of 'questioning' even if traditional 'answers' turn out to be right.) I also think she misunderstands or misrepresents Thomas Szasz a bit (and not just because she spells his name 'Szacz'). For that stuff, she loses a star. But her positive case is sound.<br /><br />Despite a mild lack of appreciation for the need to limit government behavior, she also doesn't claim (as a previous reviewer suggests) that the police should be able to do whatever they want. The problem is that criminals are _let go_ when they're not properly Mirandized, or when search warrants aren't properly executed, or . . . you get the idea. If there were a feasible way to punish the police for cutting corners _without_ freeing known criminals, Charen would presumably be all for it. (And at any rate, even fans of _Miranda_ should agree that some of her examples are pretty egregious.)<br /><br />A worthy follow-up to _Useful Idiots_ and a nice companion volume to Coulter's _Slander_ and _Treason_, Patterson's _Reckless Disregard_, and all your other current favorite liberals-have-it-all-wrong books.to appreciate the real value of 'questioning' even if traditional 'answers' turn out to be right.)

He's a personable, decent, and intelligent guy; his biography is interesting because he himself is.<br /><br />(2) Having never been a leftie myself, I enjoy reading accounts by ex-lefties about how they came around to good sense. (And accounts by formerly secular-leftist Jews about how they returned to traditional observance. Medved is good buddies with Rabbi Daniel Lapin, author of _America's Real War_.)<br /><br />(3) I _dis_agree with Medved often enough (he didn't like the first _Batman_ film!) that his book illustrates an important point: despite what you may have heard, the political right is as intellectually diverse as the left.<br /><br />(4) Medved seems to have been present, albeit in the background, at nearly every important sociopolitical event of the last four decades. It's like _Forrest Gump_ for conservatives. Heck, he was at Yale with Bush, Kerry, Clinton, and Rodham; his personal accounts of those folks alone are worth reading whether you care about Medved himself or not.<br /><br />The book itself is arranged into thirty-five 'lessons', each of which is part biography, part homily. For example, Medved launches his tale with an account of his grandparents' immigration to the U.S., but rather than just presenting biographical details, he ties it in with a short account of why he thinks the existence of the United States is divinely providential. This pattern continues throughout the book, with some chapters heavier on the biography and others almost all homiletic.<br /><br />There's lots of interesting stuff packed into the cracks. You'll find out, e.g., just exactly _which_ film mentioned in _The Golden Turkey Awards_ was actually a hoax.<br /><br />Medved is, of course, a well-known film critic who thinks (with good reason) that 'Hollyweird' has lost touch with American values and produces films primary to satisfy left-leaning anti-American/anti-religious critics rather than to make money. If you want to know more about his opinions, look up his online columns and read his _Hollywood vs. America_, which I reviewed some years ago.ut his opinions, look up his online columns and read his _Hollywood vs. America_, which I reviewed some years ago.	2005-01-24

Books	2	42	74	N	N	Stupefyingly bad	There aren't all that many things in this world that I absolutely loathe, and very nearly all of them are represented in this book. It gets two stars just because I think the authors are making a genuinely sincere attempt, however egregiously misguided, to answer their titular question. It gets no stars for anything else.<br /><br />Even the question is misstated: the book should have been called _Why Do Leftist Academicians Hate America?_ Only in the first few pages do the authors even bother to cite a survey of opinions outside the U.S.; the rest of the book is delivered from their navels.<br /><br />The writing is pretty uniformly horrid; the entire thing reads as though it came from the Postmodernism Generator. There's a lot of stuff about narratives, and texts that code things, and suchlike. (And they could have cut the length of the book in half by deleting every occurrence of the phrase 'as Richard Slotkin argues'.)<br /><br />The content is pretty Po-Mo as well. We're repeatedly given to understand, for example, that it's a tremendous mistake for America to assume that _our_ concepts of liberty are _everyone's_ concepts of liberty -- but this weird relativism doesn't protect _us_ from the judgment that we're unambiguously wrong to make such assumptions. That's par for the Po-Mo course.<br /><br />The big items on the Hate America List are hamburgers and cowboy movies. The hamburger gets a particularly vigorous workout in an extended (and badly forced) metaphor having to do with U.S. culture, or something -- but confusingly, actual hamburgers also seem to be at issue every now and then.<br /><br />I like hamburgers. These authors are wrong when they say hamburgers don't have any nutritional value and aren't really food. But if people in other countries don't want to eat fast food, why, then, they don't need to. Are we seriously to believe that most of the world hates America for selling them hamburgers? Why are they buying them, then?<br /><br />Plus we get all the usual uncritical acceptance of, and complaints about American indifference to, such 'threats' as global warming (which is very nearly their only example; we're constantly being told that the U.S. ignores otherwise unspecified stuff 'such as global warming'). At one point our authors seriously suggest that people living in the South American rainforest think we're hypocrites because of the way we fail to protect our own wetlands. Again, did they actually _ask_ anybody about this stuff? Does anyone really think that people living in jungles are scratching their heads trying to figure out why Americans drain swamps? (Or that the Americans who drain swamps are the _same_ Americans who fuss about preserving jungles?)<br /><br />Consistency is not their strong suit. On one page they'll accuse the U.S. of thinking the entire world's interests coincide with its own, and on another they'll get mad at George W. Bush for expressly stating that he's putting America's self-interest ahead of the rest of the world's. Which is it?<br /><br />And why do they just assume that it's somehow wrong for the President of the U.S. to put U.S. interests first? That's _exactly_ what I want my president to do. You go, George!<br /><br />There's quite a bit of other stuff that the authors just assume is wrong (and assume we'll agree without discussion). For example, in one passage, the authors carry on at length about the tremendous size and effectiveness of the U.S. military. I was feeling pretty proud about that until I realized the authors thought it was _bad_. Not that they changed my mind or anything; it's just that, at that point, I realized they were _really_ (though not deliberately) arguing that people hate America for our virtues.<br /><br />Their understanding of economics is nonexistent. They seriously contend -- you may want to sit down for this -- that the U.S. _makes other countries poor by selling them goods at low prices_. I'm not making that up. Sure, the sudden availability of cheap imported widgets may force the local widgetmaker to look for another line of work, but it frees up some of everybody else's income and thereby adds to the total wealth. By what leap of illogic do our authors expand the widgetmaker's temporary misfortune into a permanent condition of an entire community? (And they seem to think there's something indescribably malevolent about ever selling goods below their cost of production. Haven't they ever bought a remaindered book?)<br /><br />In addition to being annoyed by our high standard of living, they're also pretty incensed that the U.S. refuses to sign the Universal Declaration of Human Rights because we don't recognize a 'right to food'. That there might be a _connection_ between our belief in self-reliance and our great economic prosperity doesn't seem to occur to them; they think, in effect, that the way to keep people from drowning is to declare that everybody has a right to float.<br /><br />Enough. This isn't serious analysis of anything at all. Skip it unless you want a few good laughs.her line of work, but it frees up some of everybody else's income and thereby adds to the total wealth.

But they do overlap a lot, and after reading this book you may have trouble telling them apart.<br /><br />The fact -- and it is a fact -- that unions have caused much more harm than they've cured won't be a surprise to anyone who has a practical grasp of economics. The right to bargain collectively does have some small effect, but there's probably never been a union in history that strictly limited itself to collective bargaining. (For example, unions consistently make their strikes more effective than they deserve to be by forcibly preventing 'scabs' from replacing them at the jobs they won't do. Otherwise, most 'strikes' would just be fancy ways to get fired and replaced.)<br /><br />Moreover, the economic benefits that unions allegedly secure are actually achieved by the businesses themselves -- who would, and do, make them available voluntarily anyway, because businesses compete for employees even more surely than for customers. If a union ever gets employees a better deal than an employer was offering, the strong presumption is that the 'better deal' is significantly less economically feasible.<br /><br />What may be news to many is the _degree_ to which unions have departed from their ostensible purpose. According to Linda Chavez and Daniel Gray (and their numerous, well-documented sources), Big Labor has gotten _way_ more out of hand than Big Business ever has. And in the process, it's become probably the single most powerful political, economic, and criminal/terrorist force behind what used to be the socialist wing, and is now the mainstream, of the Democratic Party.<br /><br />Don't take my word for it; read the book. Listen, for example, to union bosses themselves argue, quite publicly, that violence against 'scabs' is justified because voluntarily doing a job that someone else won't do is itself somehow a form of 'violence'. Read the true stories of people who have been the victims of union-led beatings and even sniper attacks on the basis of such a twisted morality. (Then remember that these wackjobs are strong political supporters of the Democratic Party, and think hard about that party's claim to represent the American common man better than the GOP does.)<br /><br />The chapter on the National Education Association is in some ways the most fascinating. (The NEA didn't begin life as a union, but the IRS has classified it as one for over two decades now.) Consider this argument: 'If our government-monopoly schools perform poorly, let's give them more money, and if they perform well, let's give them less money. Then they'll have plenty of incentive to improve.' If that logic sounds backwards to you, you've just understood what, in a nutshell, is wrong with the entire U.S. educational system -- and thereby demonstrated that you're smarter, in that respect, than everybody who voluntarily joins a teachers' union. You'll understand in _much_ greater detail after you read Chavez's and Gray's chapter on the NEA. (And you'll also understand why Ann Coulter opened her 28 July 2004 column as follows: 'The traditional greeting at the Democratic National Convention is, \\"Where do you teach?\\"')<br /><br />Chavez and Gray document all this and more -- including unions' ties to organized crime and their undertaking of (uniformly far-left) political activity far beyond the scope of their representation in collective bargaining (and for that matter with no regard for the actual political views of their members). There's also a catchall chapter explaining the ill economic effects of unionization in general and documenting the fact that 'right-to-work' states enjoy better economic health than forced-unionism states.<br /><br />Even people who have long known of the dangers posed by unions will profit immensely from this expos&eacute; of American Big Labor.f such a twisted morality.

Col. Robert 'Buzz' Patterson (USAF, ret.) writes; 'conflict is prevented by vigilance and strength, not by appeasement and weakness.' No, might doesn't make right, but on the other hand right _without_ might isn't going to be very effective.<br /><br />That's an extraordinarily simple point, isn't it? But how thoroughly it's been lost on Patterson's targets (and critics).<br /><br />That simple point explains why national security is such an important issue, and why it _should_ be an important issue _especially_ to those who love freedom and peace. Without such security (and in particular without a competent and powerful military), our free and peaceful way of life wouldn't survive more than a few hours.<br /><br />And yet, as Patterson shows, the U.S.'s Democratic leadership for the past thirty-odd years has systematically weakened our national security (again, specifically, our military, but other books show the same thing about e.g. our intelligence capabilities).<br /><br />There are a couple of eye-opening chapters about the snooty bundle of self-absorption who calls himself John Forbes Kerry, but they're still well worth reading now that the election is over. (For one thing the man might, God help us, try to run again.) And the rest of the book is about other stuff, dating back to the Vietnam era.<br /><br />You may find bits and pieces to disagree with. But bear in mind that all of Patterson's criticisms center on exactly one point: military preparedness. As with anything else, there are competing ends to balance and tradeoffs are inevitable. If, for example, you think he's mistaken on environmental issues, ask yourself whether you'd rather have your nation defended by the armed forces or by the spotted owl.<br /><br />Patterson does an excellent job of explaining why the President -- who is, after all, commander in chief of the armed forces -- has to be someone that soldiers can respect. He shows in detail why George W. Bush _is_ such a person (and why Kerry, like so many other left-liberals, is not). But 2004 wasn't our last election for all time, and this will be good stuff to remember in 2008.<br /><br />Patterson is also extremely effective as an antidote to left-liberal propaganda. He is, for example, at pains to point out that military folks are not 'warmongers'. He also acknowledges that people serving in our armed forces do occasionally commit heinous acts, as a few did at the Abu Ghraib prison. But unlike Saddam Hussein (who did far worse there than those 'idiots' -- that's what Patterson calls them -- ever did) the military _punishes_ such acts (and indeed was already investigating the Abu Ghraib stuff before Seymour Hersh 'broke' the story). These things aren't U.S. policy and indeed are violations of both our policy and our law; the left is just wrong, and culpably so, to contend that the actions of a few at Abu Ghraib somehow make the U.S. morally equivalent to the despotic regime our military has removed from power in Iraq.<br /><br />(Incidentally, Patterson also devotes a few pages to discrediting Richard Clarke, the noisy and self-important little poltroon who wrote _Against All Enemies_. As I said in my review of that unbook -- which now has more 'not helpful' votes on it than nearly any other review I've ever posted here since I began reviewing in 1998 -- Clarke is a fraud and Patterson has his number.)<br /><br />If you're the sort of jerk who thinks there's something noble and cool about spitting on soldiers, then skip this book; you're part of the problem and Patterson's not going to fix you. But if you're anybody else, Patterson will have _something_ to say that you'll think is true and important.ny other left-liberals, is not).

In the latter, Mackie presented Leslie's 'axiarchism' (essentially, the view that the cosmos exists because it's good that it do so) as a plausible alternative to traditional theism (though an alternative that Mackie himself rejected because he disbelieved in the objectivity of 'value' anyway).<br /><br />In fact it's not really an 'alternative' to theism; more correctly, it's one possible philosophical understanding _of_ traditional theism, a point Leslie acknowledges here.<br /><br />In this lucidly written and well-argued volume, Leslie presents his more or less neoplatonic/Spinozistic outlook in accessible terms (updating the version he expounded in _Value and Existence_) and replies to various objections to its plausibility.<br /><br />His theory can be summarized in two major theses. (a) Everything we mean by 'the universe' simply _is_ the thought of a divine mind. Every object in the universe is either an object of divine thought, or (in the case of conscious beings like ourselves) a portion or subsystem of the divine mind itself. (This 'or' is not exclusive; you and I may well be both such objects and such subsystems.) (b) This divine mind (or perhaps an infinite number of such minds) exists because it's _good_ that it should do so -- i.e., that there should be a mind that, in some relevant sense, 'knows everything worth knowing'. Its existence is one case in which a fundamental sort of 'ethical requiredness' has the power to bring the 'required' state of affairs into being.<br /><br />For some reason these two theses don't seem as intuitively plausible to everyone as they do to me. So Leslie raises and meets objection after objection in an effort to show how plausible they really are. (Some of the objections are based on recherche topics in set theory, quantum physics, and other such fields, so readers without much philosophical sophistication should be prepared to work a bit. But Leslie's explanations are both clear and self-contained.)<br /><br />Of course he doesn't remove all controversy (and doesn't claim to; he puts even the strength of his own belief in (b) at better than 50% but far short of certainty). But he does meet quite a lot of nontrivial objections. (And of course he's right that very few questions of philosophical interest have answers that are 'provable' in any strong sense anyway.)<br /><br />Strictly speaking, one could accept one of his theses but not the other. But Leslie also shows how they're related to each other -- i.e., why the creative-power-of-value argument makes better sense on a pantheistic cosmology and vice versa. (A crucial claim here -- and one that Leslie supports at length -- is the claim that only minds and 'mental stuff' could have a certain requisite sort of unity.)<br /><br />I won't try to summarize his arguments here; I'll just recommend them to readers who can profit from clear and nuanced philosophical exposition. I think both theses are sound -- and although I was already a panentheist/panpsychist before I read this book, Leslie has given me a lot of additional food for thought. (By the way, Leslie refers to his own theory not as 'panentheism' but as 'pantheism'. I hope we never meet, or we'll have a very boring argument.)<br /><br />If you like it, you might also check out Timothy Sprigge's _The Vindication of Absolute Idealism_, which is the one that sold me.should be prepared to work a bit.

A novel with footnotes and a bibliography?<br /><br />Yes indeed, and the references alone will justify your buying your own copy of this novel rather than just checking it out of the library or borrowing someone else's. Michael Crichton has done his usual excellent job of research, and he's provided sources so that his reader can check his work. (Readers already familiar with the quasi-religious twitchiness of environmentalists on the non-subject of 'global warming' won't be surprised to see the names of Peter Huber and Bjorn Lomborg. But there's _lots_ of other stuff here.)<br /><br />So it makes the novel a little didactic. (All right, a lot didactic.) Crichton on a soapbox is still Crichton, and he's just as enjoyable to read when -- as here -- he's writing a novel with a clear moral. Since in this case the moral is controversial, he's backed it up with relevant nonfiction.<br /><br />The moral is essentially that stated by W.K. Clifford over a century ago: 'It is wrong, everywhere and always, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence.' And part of what makes it wrong is that when unfounded ideas take hold, people tend to die. When the rubber meets the road, 'caring' and 'good intentions' are irrelevant; intelligence, competence, and knowledge are what matter. Well-meant ignorance is still ignorance, and its victims are still dead. (Go tell the families of the millions killed by malaria that you 'meant well' when you supported the banishing of DDT in the face of an unsubstantiated cancer scare.)<br /><br />You might expect the plot of the novel to be secondary to the 'lesson'. But it's not; the plot is actually quite engaging and the story is well told. (I read the entire novel in one day because I couldn't put it down.) The meat of it (which is all I'm going to tell you about) is a plan by environmental crazies to cause a few eco-disasters to make the world take their theories more seriously. There's a lot of gripping action, some cool technology, and the occasional bit of thoroughly horrifying gruesomeness. (And since Crichton is working with an ensemble cast here, you never know in advance who will live and who will die. There's no guarantee that _any_ single character will make it to the end of the book.) The characterization isn't much to speak of, but the major characters are drawn with sufficiently bold strokes to be recognizable and consistent.<br /><br />There's no doubt, though, that the drama is structured around the lessons.

Even if you're not aware that he wrote the lyrics to e.g. 'A Boy Named Sue' and 'Cover of the Rolling Stone', you've undoubtedly at least heard of _The Giving Tree_ and _Where the Sidewalk Ends_ and _A Light in the Attic_ and _Lafcadio, the Lion Who Shot Back_ and _The Missing Piece_ and . . .<br /><br />You probably don't need me to introduce you to this wickedly hilarious and subversive book, either. It's one of the most side-splitting things Silverstein ever wrote, and if you know who he was, you've probably heard of it. It's brilliant, and it's guaranteed -- maybe even deliberately designed -- to annoy the sort of person who says 'I have a sense of humor, but'. (Which always, _always_ translates to 'I don't have a sense of humor'. You can take that to the bank.)<br /><br />But if you don't yet have your own copy, you might be put off by the fact that the new edition's title says it's for 'adults only'. That's misleading; in fact it's almost exactly the reverse of the truth. There's no 'adult material' in the entire book -- just some stuff that might be a little risky for kids too young or unsophisticated to understand the jokes.<br /><br />But the jokes are most definitely for kids -- even really tall, forty-plus ones like me. Do you know any 'adults' who would be amused at the sly hint that you should give Daddy a haircut while he naps because, having spent all his money on toys and oatmeal for _you_, 'poor poor poor poor Daddy' can't afford to go to a barber? Or who would laugh uncontrollably at the suggestion that if you tell the kidnapper your daddy has a lot of money, maybe he'll let you ride in his really keen fast car?<br /><br />'Adults only', my tochis. Kids understand this humor _way_ better than 'adults' do; any grownup who laughs at it is really a great big kid. I'm giving a copy to one of my daughters for her birthday, with strict instructions not to show it to my wife. [Later note: Her reaction when I gave it to her was to laugh herself silly on every page and say repeatedly, 'That is _so_ wrong.']<br /><br />Kids are nowhere near as touchy about this dark-humored stuff as 'adults' are. When I was a toddler, my parents used to sing me a cute little song about chopping me up for kindling wood; I don't think I suffered any emotional scars. And most 'nursery rhymes' -- not to mention fairy tales -- are bloodthirsty horror stories. When most kids find out what 'Ring Around the Rosey' is _really_ about, they think it's _cool_.<br /><br />Your own kids' chances of keeping their sense of humor into 'adulthood' increase immeasurably if they have a copy of this book to help them. Give it to them at once. No loving parent subjects a child to an unnecessary risk of maturity.I gave it to her was to laugh herself silly on every page and say repeatedly, 'That is _so_ wrong.']    Kids are nowhere near as touchy about this dark-humored stuff as 'adults' are.

I'm now on my third paperback copy.<br /><br />At a philosophical level, the story is a grand bait-and-switch: we're drawn into the trap with promises of Aristotle and Roger Bacon, and in the end we're paid off in Wittgenstein. Okay, there's a sense in which this is an appropriate outcome when the protagonist is a buddy of William of Ockham. But there's something faintly unfair about it, both philosophically and dramatically, and I'm deducting a star for that reason.<br /><br />But the story itself is great. The brooding monastery is perfectly conceived, the intellectual atmosphere draws the reader firmly into the fourteenth century, and the endlessly fascinating esoteric secrets get better with every rereading. (They remind many readers, including me, of Jorge Luis Borges -- who, appropriately, makes a sort of anti-cameo appearance as Jorge of Burgos.)<br /><br />Of course William of Baskerville is intended to recall Sherlock Holmes. Perhaps less obviously, his protege (W)Adso(n) performs essentially the same function as Holmes's own lifelong companion, i.e., giving the reader a pair of eyes through which to see things without being let in on all the secrets too soon.<br /><br />But this is not a 'detective novel'; Eco is merely using that genre in order to subvert it for his own purposes -- which he does in grand style. This is a deeply philosophical novel in which the dramatic action is defined and constrained by the intricate interplay of its themes.<br /><br />And despite the 'moral' of the tale, it's a perfectly nice ladder and there's not the slightest reason to throw it away. The rather Po-Mo destination, on the other hand, isn't all that pleasant a place to arrive. Fortunately Eco's practice is better than his preaching: he tells a fine tale of intrigue, mystery, and adventure, enjoyable for its own sake right up to and beyond the moment when he blows the foundation out from under it.<br /><br />By the way, William Weaver's translation is excellent. His erudition and sense of style are a good match to Eco's own.der it.    By the way, William Weaver's translation is excellent.

Bush. (_At Any Cost_ -- an excellent book as well -- was an account of Al Gore's attempts to steal the 2000 election, not of Bush's presidency itself.)<br /><br />I read _Misunderestimated_ first, but this one is every bit as good. It begins with 9/11 and follows the Bush Administration's responses, up to and including the removal of the Taliban from Afghanistan. (The war to depose Saddam Hussein is covered in the next volume.)<br /><br />Sammon makes no secret of his own support for Bush (and his lack of respect for Bush's immediate predecessor in office). But this isn't a liability, journalistically or otherwise. It isn't that he's not _capable_ of criticizing the Bush Administration (and he does chide the White House for its occasional misstep); it's that he really has come to the conclusion that the Administration is doing a good job and the President has proved equal to his historical tasks. (And as for Clinton, well, let's just say that the ability to see the warts on _that_ presidency isn't exactly a sign of bias.)<br /><br />Sammon's account is crisp, clear, and briskly paced -- and, since he's been in such close touch with the President, it's the next best thing to being inside Bush's head. It is, in short, a captivating and informative read.<br /><br />It also incorporates several of Bush's speeches in their entirety -- including his inspiring remarks in the National Cathedral and his stirring 9/20/01 address on Capitol Hill before a joint session of Congress.<br /><br />Together with _Misunderestimated_, it's a fine account of America's post-9/11 transition from peacetime to wartime. Bush-haters won't like it, but that's their problem.	2004-11-27

The phrase is Lenin's; the application is Charen's. And it's quite apt.<br /><br />Charen, columnist/commentator and former speechwriter for Nancy Reagan, is loaded for bear and out to keep history from being rewritten. The ones doing the rewriting are those 'useful idiots', many of whom now want us to believe _they_ helped to win the Cold War.<br /><br />Nuts, says Charen -- and she proves it by reminding us, in excruciating detail, just what these folks actually said and did during the Cold War era. Even if you remember a lot of this stuff (as I do), you'll appreciate the one-volume reminder -- and if you're in one of the generations following mine, you'll benefit even more directly.<br /><br />(Or maybe not; apparently there are still people out there who take issue with Charen's views of Alger Hiss and the Rosenbergs. Certainly after the Venona decrypts became public about ten years ago, there just hasn't been any question that at least Julius -- though _maybe_ not Ethel -- was a Soviet spy, and there's no serious doubt about Hiss. If Charen doesn't persuade you on these points, follow up with one of the several excellent books on the U.S. Army's Venona Project, or read Ann Coulter's discussion in _Treason_.)<br /><br />At any rate, Charen's defense of unrewritten history is right on target. Communism has claimed the lives of some 100 million victims, and it's a little late for these 'useful idiots' to turn around and pretend they _really_ opposed it all along.<br /><br />They didn't. In fact many of them regarded the U.S. and the Soviet Union as 'morally equivalent' (or, worse, blamed the U.S.) and urged dangerous policies that would have doomed this nation. (Don't misunderstand this as an unwillingness to criticize the U.S. or a tendency to dismiss all of its critics as traitors; Charen doesn't think the U.S. is above criticism and certainly doesn't think it's automatically unpatriotic e.g. to oppose a war.)<br /><br />Nor is this purely a matter of historical interest. Those 'useful idiots' are still out there, blaming the U.S. for 9/11, treating our government as the 'moral equivalent' of al-Qaeda and/or the bloody regime of Saddam Hussein, and blocking effective American action at every step.<br /><br />Charen's book stands just fine on its own terms, of course, but it also makes a nice companion volume to Coulter's aforementioned _Treason_.s purely a matter of historical interest.

By the time she's through, you'll wonder why any of us were bothered by Nixon.<br /><br />Coulter's later books are excellent too, but they're more polemical in tone (and deliberately designed to entertain conservatives by provoking shrieks of outrage from left-liberals). This one isn't without its bits of invective, but almost all of it is factual; you can read it even if you don't care for Coulter in general.<br /><br />Coulter gives us a quick overview of the meaning of the phrase 'high crimes and misdemeanors', contending that it's a term of art with roots reaching deep into British history (and thus has a scope far beyond what we would today classify as crimes and misdemeanors). She then proceeds to document, in detail, the high crime/misdemeanor most of us couldn't help but know about, namely the Paula Jones case and its aftermath. It will be hard to read Coulter's exposition without concluding that Clinton obstructed justice, perjured himself, and suborned perjury (which, at least as far as impeachment was concerned, is what the fuss was about; it was never 'just about sex').<br /><br />But that's not all. Coulter also takes us on a tour of the _other_ skeletons in the Clinton Administration's closet -- some of which are much worse than the Paula Jones stuff and could have justified impeachment all by themselves. Travelgate. Filegate. Fostergate. Chinagate. The works.<br /><br />Originally, the book was an argument for impeachment. But now, some years after the impeachment occurred, the book is still of interest.<br /><br />If nothing else, it will help to keep us from voting Democratic for a while, because we won't be able to keep ourselves from snickering every time the guy shows up somewhere in support of a candidate.	2004-11-14

She's demonstrating -- in a book that surpasses Bernard Goldberg's _Bias_ in scope and detail -- that time and again, indeed systematically, left-liberals simply do not (cannot?) tell the truth about conservatives. But there is method to their madness, and Coulter carefully shows us the propagandistic pattern.<br /><br />Despite what some readers (if they really read it) seem to have supposed, Coulter is not complaining about polemics. She's a polemicist herself and freely admits it. Her objection is not that left-liberals aren't being nice but that they aren't being accurate or honest; their so-called political analysis generally amounts to a third-grader's cry of 'You're stupid!', an imprecise and incorrect personal attack that has nothing to do with whatever issue is really at hand. In other words, her objection to calling conservatives 'dumb' is not (merely) that it's mean but that they aren't.<br /><br />Coulter can (and does) call names with the best of them. The difference is that the targets of _her_ name-calling generally deserve it; she's done her homework and made sure the names really do apply. (And she doesn't use polemic as a way of _distracting_ from the real issues; just the opposite.) So, here and in general, she cuts loose on them freely, with hilarious results.<br /><br />And like it or not, she _is_ 'a uniter, not a divider' -- of conservatives. Of course she thinks left-liberalism is essentially treason against the United States of America (see _Treason_ for her elaboration); I'm not sure why anyone would expect her to Reach Out A Hand of Friendship to people she regards as traitors to the Republic.<br /><br />But she does unite the people she's trying to unite. The book is really intended to be a moral shot in the arm for conservatives, and in that respect it's a success. It's not supposed to 'convert' any left-liberals, so it's pretty pointless to bellyache that Coulter isn't Dale Carnegie.atives, and in that respect it's a success.

And she backs up her claim.<br /><br />It's not that she thinks conservatives are never wrong. But their errors really are _errors_. Over on the Left, they're not just wrong; they're culpably, morally, treasonously wrong. She's had enough noise about their alleged good intentions; their pattern of both opinion and behavior, she contends, is nothing short of sedition.<br /><br />This subject -- i.e., the claim that left-liberals are traitors to the Republic -- is of course not one that lends itself to a huggy-squeezy let's-all-just-get-along approach. Liberals may find her a bit hard on the ticker; to borrow a phrase from Douglas Adams, Coulter is not above polemic, sarcasm, and invective the way the ocean is not above the sky. But her polemic is backed by facts and her targets deserve what they get.<br /><br />Her overall approach is to correct the rewriting recent history has undergone at the hands of the terminally pusillanimous. The history she un-rewrites includes, notably, Senator Joe McCarthy and President Ronald Reagan.<br /><br />In a series of incisive chapters, Coulter sets the record straight about 'McCarthyism' point by point. She reminds us of just what, exactly, Sen. McCarthy was on about (and when; of course, as the 'Sen.' indicates, he wasn't involved in the _House_ Un-American Activities Committee), and points out (to anyone who missed the news ten years ago when the results of the Army's Venona Project became public) that there were, unquestionably, hundreds of Soviet spies in highly-placed positions in the U.S. government. That alone doesn't mean McCarthy was right -- he did, after all, expend most of his efforts looking not for actual 'spies' but for Communists (whether in government positions or not) -- but I think Coulter does at least manage to reclaim him as a patriot, if a somewhat bumptious one.<br /><br />She also devotes a good deal of space to a proposition that shouldn't require any defense: that President Ronald Reagan won the Cold War. There are lots of issues on which I respect a wide range of opinions even when I disagree, but this isn't one of them; there is _so_ little question that Reagan (by any reasonable measure the U.S.'s greatest twentieth-century president) won the Cold War that I won't even bother arguing with anyone who thinks otherwise. He was the very first U.S. president to challenge Communism on moral grounds -- and he was the very first U.S. president unwilling to settle for appeasement, peaceful coexistence, or detente, preferring instead to hold out for victory. He got it -- and, if proof be needed, Coulter will prove it to the satisfaction of anyone who is both literate and honest.<br /><br />Coulter also does a nice job on other subjects -- the Vietnam War, for example, and of course Iraq. In particular she's a lot of fun in the all-too-few passages where she takes aim at left-liberal celebrities. (I can't imagine why anyone takes celebrities' political views seriously merely because they're celebrities. In fact, I don't know of anyone who does, except of course other celebrities.)<br /><br />But fun or not, make no mistake: by 'treason' Coulter means treason. Her overarching claim, again, is that these folks are not merely mistaken but positively seditious (whether deliberately or because they've been duped). Her no-nonsense conclusion: 'The inevitable logic of the liberal position is to be for treason.'<br /><br />The whole book is a rare and well-written treat.

Bush as he makes the transition from a peacetime president to a wartime president, and specifically as he prepares for and prosecutes the war in Iraq.<br /><br />If you have an ounce of patriotic loyalty in you, the first chapter will make your jaw drop to the floor as you read about how the President of the United States was treated during a visit to Portland OR. It's simply stunning that actual U.S. citizens would display such contempt for the office of the Presidency and the man who occupies it. (And can you imagine Americans waving signs calling for their President's _death_? Am I on the right planet? Those of us who wanted Clinton out of office called for impeachment, not assassination.)<br /><br />And if you have any moral sense at all, the _second_ chapter -- a brisk summary of Saddam Hussein's bloody career -- will remove any lingering doubts you may have had about removing this lethal and treacherous lunatic from power. (You'll also understand why Iraqi civilians cheered the 'invaders' and Iraqi soldiers surrendered to anybody they could find, even journalists.) Iraq was off our radar for several years under President Clinton, so I suppose it's not surprising that some of this stuff will be news to a lot of people. But if you missed it, Sammon will fill you in, tersely and completely; his reporting here is a punch to the gut.<br /><br />For those two chapters alone, we owe Sammon a great debt of thanks. But the rest of the book measures up to that standard too. (I'm particularly fond of the chapter detailing Dan Rather's fawning interview with Saddam; Sammon's commentary is spot-on and priceless. In general, his treatment of the media's handling of the Iraq war is excellent.) When you're through reading it, you'll have a much better sense of the inner workings of the Bush Presidency than you'll get from (literally) four years of listening to the popular media.<br /><br />President Bush may not always finish the same sentence (or even the same word) that he starts, but he's the best president we've had since Reagan. (He also chooses his people well, as a good executive should.) I still disagree with him on some domestic-policy issues (notably same-sex marriage) but on antiterrorism he was _way_ more right than I was three years ago.<br /><br />The U.S. is in competent hands -- which would not have been true had the recent election gone the other way.

Had you ever heard of Richard Clarke before this book was published? Me either. But his book is one of several that are changing my mind about what a terrible job George W. Bush is allegedly doing.<br /><br />Clarke thinks he knows what the Bush Administration should do to stop terrorism. And he's certainly the man to give such advice: he's a career civil servant who spent _thirty years_ not stopping terrorism. (And then he wasn't picked to be National Security Advisor; Condoleezza Rice got the job instead. The expresssion 'axe to grind' has such a nice metaphorical unity with the expression 'hatchet job', doesn't it?)<br /><br />According to Clarke, Bill Clinton didn't stop terrorism either, but it's not Clinton's fault. Oh, sure, some CIA guys say Clinton wasn't clear that he actually _wanted_ Osama bin Laden killed, but they must be lying to cover up for their own ineptitude. Heck, after 9/11, Clinton _said_ he'd spent four years trying to take out bin Laden. This explanation will surely have the ring of plausibility to the many millions who regard Clinton as a paragon of clarity and honesty.<br /><br />Clarke seems to be a little miffed that people didn't listen to him when he warned them about al Qaeda. (This sounds like a bigger deal than it is; even the little thingie on your VCR that blinks midnight is eventually right if you stay up late enough.) But his claims on this point should not be accepted too readily.<br /><br />He suspects, for example, that Condi Rice had never heard of al Qaeda until he mentioned them to her in early 2001 -- this suspicion being based on her _facial expression_, despite the fact that she had publicly discussed al Qaeda well before that time. It's much more likely that Clarke -- his keen mind honed razor-sharp by three decades of deskwarming -- wrongly thought he was telling people something they didn't already know.<br /><br />Nevertheless, even assuming _arguendo_ that he was the sole voice crying in the wilderness about the al Qaeda threat (that is, even generously assuming that Richard Clarke was the only person in the entire United States government who knew that al Qaeda was behind a couple of embassy bombings and the attack on the USS _Cole_), I think I can hazard a guess as to why no one listened to him: it's because his advice is colossally boneheaded. Based on his recommendations in the closing chapter of this book, I wouldn't have listened to him either.<br /><br />For example: he thinks one of the things the Bush Administration _should_ have done is to try to counter 'the ideology of al Qaeda' by 'promot[ing] the real Islam'. Sure. There must be _lots_ of Muslim terrorists who would have taken George W. Bush's word about the True Meaning of Islam over that of their own leaders and laid down their arms if only Bush hadn't squandered his opportunity to enlighten them. Well, maybe it's not too late: we can still deploy Tom Cruise to teach them the Way of the Samurai.<br /><br />He also picks on John Ashcroft for 'mismanag[ing] the important perceptions component of the war on terrorism' by _coming across_ as someone who was 'attacking rather than protecting our civil liberties'. Yes, you read that correctly. Some people have criticized Ashcroft for supposedly violating civil liberties; Clarke criticizes him for _looking_ like he was when he _wasn't_.<br /><br />I'd like to know how Ashcroft could have done a better job with the 'perceptions component'. Good heavens, he's the Attorney General, a Bush appointee, a Republican, a Christian, and a Southerner; with that profile, the ACLU's 'perception' would have been that he was attacking civil liberties if he'd wished somebody a nice day. Should he have taken spin lessons from Janet Reno?

At one point he notes that Bush said something about the War on Terrorism having begun on 9/11, and thinks this somehow conflicts with Bush's later statement that there was 'no evidence that Saddam Hussein was involved in the September 11 attacks'. Where's the contradiction exactly? I can't find a single statement in which Bush has ever claimed that such evidence existed. Whenever Bush says the War on Terrorism started on 9/11, he means the same thing he's always meant: that the 9/11 attack marked a huge change in the U.S.'s antiterrorism policy. Whether you favor invading Iraq or not (I originally didn't), Bush has never claimed the invasion was a direct response to Saddam's possible involvement in 9/11. (And Bush's statement that there was no evidence of direct involvement by Saddam is obviously not, as Clarke's slipshod logic would have it, an 'admi[ssion] . . . that there was no connection'.)<br /><br />It's tempting to think that Clarke _must_ know this and must therefore be lying.

475984:US	52474360	R50KP852NI63O	1400054184	925221592	How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must): The World According to Ann Coulter	Books	5	103	189	N	N	Delightful	I've been reading Ann Coulter's columns on the Internet for several years, and I like her a lot. It turns out that her columns are even better in book form: some of these were never published before (guess why), and even some of the others were published only in expurgated form.<br /><br />Coulter is a brilliant writer and a 'public intellectual' actually deserving of that description. She's intelligent, witty, logical, candid, articulate, and bitingly sarcastic -- and, bless her heart, she doesn't suffer fools gladly. You don't _have_ to agree with her in order to find her vastly entertaining and thought-provoking, but it does help. (It also helps to be able to _read_. I'm amazed at how many irresponsible criticisms have been levelled at this woman based on nothing more than egregious misrepresentations of what she's actually written.)<br /><br />I'm not even really sure what the controversy is about. Take one of her most (in)famous statements, specifically regarding those unarguably foul creatures who celebrated the 9/11 attacks by dancing in the streets: Coulter wrote (on 9/12) that '[w]e should invade their countries, kill their leaders, and convert them to Christianity.'<br /><br />Well, the Bush Administration has already successfully checked off items 1 and 2 on that list -- much to the chagrin of people who think war is just never ever ever the answer. (I should add that although that isn't my own belief, I was not initially in favor of the invasion of Iraq for other reasons. But although I believe in giving peace a chance, I think the U.S. _has_ given it one. At any rate I'm no friend of the Kurd-gassing rape-room-operating tyrant who just got his butt so thoroughly and deservedly kicked.) Oddly, though, it's the part _after_ Coulter's impeccably placed final serial comma that seems to have raised the most hackles.<br /><br />It's hard to see why. In the first place, the proposition follows _a fortiori_ from the Christian belief that _every_ non-Christian should convert to Christianity, and since Coulter is a Christian, it is neither surprising nor even remotely controversial that she should subscribe to this belief. (On the Christian view, the alternative is that those people suffer eternally in hell; is Coulter being vilified for suggesting that America's mortal enemies should be _saved_ from that fate?)<br /><br />But maybe some non-Christians think she was daring to imply that there was something inferior about the Religion of Peace to which those bloodthirsty America-hating dancers adhere. So what? Look, folks, I'm not Christian either, but she's got a point. Watch the nightly news for a few weeks and tell me how many times you hear the phrase 'Christian terrorist'.<br /><br />Anyway, as I was saying, you don't _have_ to agree with her to enjoy her. I certainly don't agree with her about everything, although I do actually agree with her quite a lot. (She likes Bush better than I do, but I wouldn't vote for Kerry if he were the only one running. And among other things, she's got an excellent short explanation of the California electricity 'crisis' and why it wasn't an example of 'deregulation', and one of the best defenses I've read _anywhere_ of the Confederate flag.)<br /><br />My one major beef is illustrated in her title: her surrender of the term 'liberal' to her opposition. Ann Coulter herself is a 'liberal' according to the standard, historical, etymological meaning of the word (the meaning we had to invent the word 'libertarian' to reclaim for defenders of liberty and the free society; Coulter is both a conservative _and_ a small-l libertarian).<br /><br />Her targets are _not_ 'liberals'. By and large they are knaves, fools, and ignoramuses, many of whom still can't tell the difference between 'censorship' and 'withholding of government funding' even after it's been repeatedly pointed out to them. The very worst of them are liars, thieves, and killers. They represent not liberty but something else. (And please note that the antecedent of 'they' is 'her targets'. Coulter doesn't attack all self-described liberals -- or even all Democrats, as witness e.g. her touching tribute to John F. Kennedy, Jr.)<br /><br />If you haven't read her before, start here (before the election, if possible) and then get her other three books.

Author Stephen Hayes answers the question carefully and thoroughly, concluding that there is a great deal of strong evidence, although a lot of it is indirect and none of it is absolutely conclusive.<br /><br />This evidence does not show that Saddam was connected with the events of 9/11 (nor, for that matter, that he wasn't). That's a different issue; both Hayes and (to its credit) the Bush Administration have kept these two issues more clearly separated than their critics sometimes have.<br /><br />This evidence also does not necessarily provide a justification for launching a war against Iraq. (Indeed, after reading the passages in this book detailing al Qaeda's connections with Sudan and the role of Hassan al Tarabi in bringing about a rapprochement between the secularist Saddam and the radical-Islamist bin Laden, you may be wondering why Bush decided to hit Baghdad instead of Khartoum.) A possible, even likely, connection between Saddam and bin Laden may not provide full support for the Bush Administration's decisions, and Hayes doesn't claim otherwise.<br /><br />What Hayes _does_ accomplish is to set out the evidence for that connection, intelligibly and cogently, and to reply to the most common arguments that such a connection is unlikely or impossible (e.g. that secularists and radical Islamists couldn't possibly work together). In the process he also debunks a number of 'urban legends' as to what the Bush Administration has and has not claimed with respect to Saddam, bin Laden, and 9/11.<br /><br />And he correctly explains what everyone should already know: the decision to attack Iraq was not based on the belief that Saddam was involved in 9/11 or that bin Laden was hiding in Iraq; it was based on the view (whether right or wrong) that 9/11 demonstrated that the U.S. had better start dealing much more sternly with nations that encourage, aid, and/or harbor anti-U.S. terrorists.<br /><br />It's still entirely possible to disagree with the Administration's decisions. But first let's at least be clear what those decisions were and what they were based on. Responsible public discourse isn't furthered by wild claims on _either_ side.<br /><br />Highly recommended, especially (but not exclusively) to U.S. voters who want to weigh some actual evidence before the upcoming presidential election.encourage, aid, and/or harbor anti-U.S. terrorists.

Feinman's claim is that the law isn't something mysterious that you have to belong to an esoteric priesthood in order to understand; on the contrary, it's possible for the ordinary layperson to understand what the law is and how it works.<br /><br />His book bears out that claim. Heck, I wish _I'd_ had it to read before I started law school; he sets out the major concepts clearly and intelligibly, in the process touching on many of the key cases. I'd have had a _much_ better idea of what to expect during my first year if I'd read this first. (Nor would that have exhausted its usefulness. It would probably be handy to have around while, say, Putting Together The Big Picture for your state bar exam.)<br /><br />Nor, of course, is it just for future lawyers. It's suitable for anyone who wants to know how the U.S. legal system works. ('Knowing how it works' here means 'understanding the principles and competing incentives that drive the development of U.S. law', not 'knowing how to act as your own lawyer'. This book isn't about 'how'; it's about 'why'. If you want to draft your own employee handbook or something, get a book from Nolo Press.)<br /><br />You don't have to be of any particular political persuasion to profit from it, either. It's very fair and even-handed, carefully presenting both sides of every controversial issue.<br /><br />In fact, just about the only people in the U.S. who may not get much out of it are practicing attorneys, who are already supposed to know all this stuff. And even there, it's just barely possible that . . . nahhhhh.	2004-10-12

I'm deducting a star because Jay Feinman paints his 'opposition' with such a broad brush. (In this respect he's a breath of fresh air next to, say, Michael Moore or Al Franken. Nevertheless that leaves considerable room for improvement.)<br /><br />Feinman, also the author of the excellent _Law 101_ and a very clear expositor of legal issues, sets out here to defend a century's worth of development in American common law against those who would prefer to turn the legal clock back to 1900 (or before). Among his stated targets: classical liberals, libertarians, conservatives, neoconservatives, and pretty much everybody other than 'progressives'.<br /><br />As a libertarian myself, I might not be expected to find this sort of thing congenial. But on a few subjects my libertarianism dresses to the left, and at any rate -- more to come on this point -- Feinman's arguments aren't quite as dependent on political ideology as he thinks they are.<br /><br />The meat of his case is set out in the book's middle six chapters -- two each on tort law, contract law, and property law. In each of these areas, he contends, developments of the last century or so have rendered the common law more protective of the interests of the less wealthy and powerful, and it's important to preserve those advances.<br /><br />I'm not an easy reader to please on this subject, and Feinman does about as well as it's possible to do: I agree with about two-thirds of what he writes, respect his arguments in most of the rest, and only once or twice feel like hurling the book against the wall. That may not sound like much, but it compares favorably with a lot of other legal commentators.<br /><br />On tort law, I agree with so much of what he writes that the differences aren't worth discussing. He's right; the common law of torts is working just fine (i.e., as well as law ever does), and it would be mind-bendingly stupid to 'reform' it. (This subject is pretty ideology-independent. For example, my own favored reading of the Second Amendment is somewhere to the right of the NRA's, but I still think making it impossible to sue gun manufacturers is just plain dumb.)<br /><br />In contract law, the heart of his claim is that twentieth-century liberalizations in interpretation and enforceability have provided protections to consumers who might otherwise (and previously did) find themselves stuck with vastly unfavorable contract terms that in many cases they might not even have read before 'agreeing' to them. Recent developments, he says, have undone those protections, to the detriment of consumers.<br /><br />Here, too, I agree (he's especially good on the hazards posed by arbitration clauses) but with one misgiving. Feinman likes to pick on Judge Alex Kozinski and quotes him here as a proponent of the idea that 'loose' contract interpretation by the courts could make it hard for parties to a contract to tell with precision just what they were agreeing to.<br /><br />Well, I don't think Judge Kozinski walks on water or anything, but he's much more sensible than Feinman gives him credit for. And in this case he's raising an entirely valid point -- and one that wouldn't tell one bit against Feinman's own case, if he handled it right. At the very least, I'd have liked to see an acknowledgement of the legitimacy of Kozinski's concern and an argument that modern contract law can address it (which I think it can, and Feinman seems to think so too). At any rate, there seems to be nothing wrong with admitting that there are sound arguments on _both_ sides of the issue, and that this is one of the things that make contract law so difficult.<br /><br />With property law, we enter more dangerous waters. Feinman starts, wisely, with Wesley Hohfeld's seminal analysis of legal rights and duties, and contends mightily against an 'absolutist' view of property rights. Fine so far, and he racks up lots of points both in his positive discussion and in his counterarguments (e.g. on the subject of John Locke, whose theory of property rights contains an important proviso not generally discussed in the libertarian literature).<br /><br />But Feinman seems unaware that many of his 'opponents' -- Richard Epstein, for example (whose view of 'takings' Feinman rightly notes is, to put it mildly, not what the framers meant) -- _also_ reject an 'absolutist' understanding of property rights. (Epstein, much to the embarrassment of some of his libertarian fellow travellers, is a utilitarian. Feinman uses 'absolute' to mean several different things, and Epstein would agree that property rights are not 'absolute' according to most of those meanings.) And he seems to find the (crucial) economic role of property rights not worth discussing -- a bit ironically, since he is so keenly aware of the role of economic incentives in getting tort claims litigated.<br /><br />(Nor is it obvious why Epstein's departure from the framers' understanding of 'takings' is such a disaster, since Feinman himself allows closely analogous departures elsewhere. Our post-_Katz_ understanding of 'searches' is not, for example, limited to strictly physical property, but I don't see Feinman objecting to our extended Fourth Amendment protection.)<br /><br />I could pick nits about this subject all day, so I'll just say that Feinman's positive arguments are good but would have benefitted from a more nuanced exposition of the views of his opponents. In the absence of such an exposition, I'm not at all sure that his shots are hitting their intended targets.<br /><br />I think this is true in general of the entire book. Feinman's 'frame story' is that a bunch of conservatives are conspiring to repeal the twentieth century, and there's surely something to this story (whether good or bad). But in the process of telling it, he lumps together people who might be surprised to be found in one another's company.<br /><br />(The metaphor 'repeal the twentieth century' isn't very apt here. You don't 'repeal' common law; you 'repeal' statutes. And it's true that lots of libertarians and conservatives -- including me -- would gladly repeal a large number of twentieth-century _statutes_. But Feinman's book isn't about statutory law; it's about the common law, with regard to which I don't believe there's any such consensus.)<br /><br />A more unified approach to political theory would have helped. Feinman buries some of his points about the structure of federalism, and the relative roles of federal and state government, in the later portion of the book, but they'd have been handy in his discussion of torts too (where they're lurking implicitly but not stated clearly).<br /><br />Also helpful would have been a clear statement that the market and the law go together in human society roughly as words and grammar go together in human language. Feinman doesn't want 'conservatives' to turn the clock back a century, but his own occasional bursts of anti-'market' rhetoric sound as though _they_ hail from around 1900.<br /><br />On the whole, though, the strength of Feinman's arguments and examples carries the day. The heart of the book _is_ his positive case, and he makes it very well.<br /><br />Highly recommended, then, despite my deduction of one star. Half the job in public discourse is to get the arguments and counterarguments clearly articulated, and you'll find Feinman helpful in that regard even if you disagree with everything he has to say. But you shouldn't; he's right a lot, and -- despite his anti-'conservative' presentation -- it's possible to agree with pretty much anything he says without changing your political alliances.theory of property rights contains an important proviso not generally discussed in the libertarian literature).

You can download the whole report for free, in PDF format, from either the GPO or the website of the 9/11 Commission. That means you can read the whole thing on your computer without spending one red cent.<br /><br />The 'official', and more expensive, editions of the book don't include any text you don't get in the PDF version. This New York Times edition does; it opens with nearly seventy pages of articles from the Grey Lady (none, I think, written by Jayson Blair) about the formation and activities of the Commission.<br /><br />This edition doesn't include the endnotes, but it does include the superscripts that lead to the notes so that you can check them in the PDF files if you want to. If you're like me, when you sit down to read the report, you don't particularly want to flip back and look at the notes anyway; that's for later, if there's a point for which you want to check a source. And precisely because this edition doesn't include all those additional pages, it's easier to tote around for lunchtime reading.<br /><br />Of course, since the report itself isn't protected by copyright in the U.S. (it's a government work), you can pretty much do what you want with the free electronic version -- including printing it out. But the paper for that job will probably cost you more than the price of this edition, and the result won't be very handy to lug around with you.<br /><br />As for the report itself, well, I'm not going to review the content here. Just read it and make up your own mind; that's what we do here in America.	2004-09-23

Oh, I'm not quite saying John G. Hemry personally invented the genre; at the very least there were a few episodes of the original _Star Trek_ series that attempted it, with varying degrees of success. But if there are other examples out there in The Literature, I haven't read them. Hemry is doing something pretty new here.<br /><br />And he's doing it mighty well. Both these books are very fine novels in each respect: military, SF, and legal.<br /><br />I can't speak directly to the 'military' aspect, but I gather Hemry is himself retired from the US Navy and knows what he's talking about. The portrait of shipboard life is also very realistic, I hear, except for one thing: the near-total lack of rough language may well leave you wondering where the expression 'cuss like a sailor' ever came from. Not that you expect naval officers to go around saying 'Request f***ing permission to come the f*** aboard' or anything, but I think I counted two hells, one pi$$ed off, and maybe a couple of stray damns. (I'm not saying this is bad, mind you, just letting you know that Hemry has toned that aspect down, probably in order to keep things suitable for younger readers.) Oh, and the Space Navy is coed.<br /><br />The SF is mostly in the background, but if you know anything about physics, you'll recognize that Hemry does too; it's buried in the details and sometimes between the lines, but he's done his homework.<br /><br />(After reading the book, I turned up some online comments suggesting that it might not qualify as 'real' SF because it could have been set without loss in today's navy as a straightforward, non-SF legal thriller. I don't think that's true; not only is there a lot of stuff here about spaceship design and operation, but the single most important 'background' legal question -- how is it possible for the United States to lay territorial claim to a volume of vacuum the boundaries of which are defined in part by moving planets? -- is one that can arise _only_ in space, and the fact that it hasn't yet been answered underlies a key plot point involving some vaguely worded orders. No, this legal question isn't brought out very clearly or very often in the story itself, because it's something of a side issue with respect to the main plot. But it's there, and the book couldn't happen without it.)<br /><br />The legal stuff is both realistic and gripping -- and as far as I can tell (I didn't specifically study military law in law school) accurate as well. Hemry can write courtroom scenes like nobody's business.<br /><br />The tale is well-crafted too. The narrative style is utterly transparent, as well-engineered expository prose should be. There are no stylistic flourishes here to call attention to the author; there's a story to be told, and the narrative tells it very straightforwardly and economically, making sure the reader never gets left behind or confused _and_ that things never drag. For obvious reasons, this approach is well suited to the subject matter.<br /><br />That subject matter is the experience of Ensign Paul Sinclair in the US Navy in 2099 -- space navy, that is, but the same branch of the service as today's wet navy, and up to its ears in the same unaltered traditions. The first hundred or so pages introduce us to Sinclair and let us watch him settling in to life aboard the USS _Michaelson_. After that, when his captain does something mind-bendingly stupid but apparently within the scope of his special orders, Sinclair finds he has a tough personal decision to make.<br /><br />I'm not going to tell you any more than that, and I strongly advise (if it's not too late) that you avoid reading the cover blurb and the summaries elsewhere on this page. With _both_ of these books, Ace has for some reason written blurbs that give away thingsthat happen over a hundred pages into the action. I strongly disapprove and wish _I_ hadn't read those blurbs.<br /><br />Great stuff, anyway, and some of the very best recent SF I've had the pleasure to read. Hemry seems to be aiming these tales at 'young adults' but they're suitable for us older adults too: there's a lot of depth in his explorations of the various sorts of duty (moral, ethical, legal, professional) and the dilemmas to which they give rise, and (as in real life) he's not afraid to leave some matters ambiguous and/or unresolved.<br /><br />There's supposed to be a third Paul Sinclair book coming out in March 2005; I'll be watching for it (and I hope Sinclair changes his mind and decides to become a lawyer). Hemry is also the author of the _Stark's War_ series, which I guess now I'll have to read.and wish _I_ hadn't read those blurbs.

They're both excellent.<br /><br />As I said in my review of the earlier book, John G. Hemry may not have personally invented the genre 'military-SF legal drama', but there can't be too many examples of it out there. And reading these two superbly crafted novels will show you why: if you pay attention to the details, you'll see a lot of expertise lurking unobtrusively in the background. There can't be all that many authors who can write with confidence about the US Navy, the physics of space travel and spaceships, _and_ military law -- let alone keep all that stuff in the background while competently _telling an interesting story_ that doesn't bog down into technical exposition.<br /><br />I'm not going to tell you a great deal about that story itself, and as with the earlier book, I strongly advise you _not_ to read the cover blurb and other book information if you haven't done so already. In each case, Ace has seen fit to promote the book by giving away things that happen well over a hundred pages in, and I would have enjoyed each of them more if I hadn't known in advance what was going to happen.<br /><br />I can safely tell you that as this one opens, Paul Sinclair has just made Lieutenant Junior Grade and is still serving aboard the USS _Michaelson_. Again, the first hundred or so pages follow him through his shipboard experiences as we watch him grow and mature as a naval officer.<br /><br />I can also tell you that early on, there's an extremely well thought out (and, incidentally, extremely funny) sequence involving a protest by an organization called 'Greenspace', who apparently do much the same sorts of things in space as their present-day predecessors do at sea. Hemry's portrayal of the Space Navy's personal and professional responses to these 'hippies' is both hilarious (this is where the meat of the humor is) and accurate (as a measure of Sinclair's assimilation to Navy life); his portrayal of the Greenspacers themselves is a _little_ bit of a caricature, but no one will have any trouble recognizing their real-life counterparts. One of my complaints about Heinlein's mostly-excellent _Starship Troopers_ is that Heinlein sets up and shoots down way too many straw men; Hemry doesn't make that mistake.<br /><br />(Any actual hippies who read this book should read the narrative and dialogue very carefully. Hemry isn't taking sides at the authorial level; if he's making a sociopolitical point here, it's the one Commander Sykes makes: by all means question assumptions and challenge beliefs -- every society needs people who will do that -- but don't, don't, don't do foolish things that put lives in danger. And if anybody out there is still under the illusion that people in military service are 'fascists', Hemry's books should help to disabuse them of such silliness.)<br /><br />Otherwise I won't give anything away. This is some of the best recent SF I've read, and I'm looking forward to reading the next Paul Sinclair book (due out in March 2005, I think).pacers themselves is a _little_ bit of a caricature, but no one will have any trouble recognizing their real-life counterparts.

In so doing, he has written a work that, over three decades after its publication, still serves as a comprehensive introduction to Austrian School economics.<br /><br />And no wonder: Rothbard viewed Austrian economics particularly and the 'science of liberty' generally as systematic philosophy, not as the mere collection of statistical facts and 'model-building'. The result is a highly readable volume that reads more like a philosophical treatise than a standard 'economics' textbook.<br /><br />Anyone who loves liberty and thinks _ideas_ are important will love this volume. Keynesians and econometricians need not apply.<br /><br />[Later note: _Human Action_, this book (this edition of which includes the portion originally shaved off and published separately as _Power and Market_), and George Reisman's _Capitalism_ are the twentieth century's Three Great Treatises on free-market economics. They don't always agree with each other, so if this subject is of interest to you, be sure to read all three.]	2004-09-02

Maybe it will tell you something that the _very first thing I did_ after taking my state bar exam last week was to buy a hardcover copy.<br /><br />Stephenson impressed the heck out of me with _Cryptonomicon_. You too? Then you'll like this one. _Quicksilver_ and the rest of the Baroque Cycle continue to explore the same themes (information theory, computer technology, the tendency of hackers to try to figure out how things work) but everything (so far) takes place a couple of centuries ago, as modern science is a-bornin'. As we met (a fictional version of) Alan Turing in _Cryptonomicon_, here we meet (fictional versions of) Isaac Newton, Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz, and Robert Hooke, among others. (And as before, long-lived redbeard Enoch Root is in the thick of things. Has somebody been reading Heinlein?)<br /><br />Stephenson is one helluva fine writer. Everything you liked about _Cryptonomicon_ is here as well: his dry and detached irony, his technical 'digressions' (they're not), his highly-wrought and  preternaturally apt metaphors, his deft handling of a sprawling plot that in other hands would simply have been unmanageable. The ideas still come fast and furious, at a rate of roughly one entire Dan Brown novel every two pages.<br /><br />(And yes, kids, this _is_ science fiction. No, it's not set in the future, and there are no spaceships or ray guns or aliens. But it's fiction, and the subject is science.)<br /><br />Beyond that, I can't tell you much without giving away actual contents. Suffice it to say that Stephenson is an extremely ambitious writer and his ambitions succeed.<br /><br />My _next_ official act will be to purchase a hardcover edition of _The Confusion_. Then I'll sit around gnawing my fingernails until October -- not just for my bar exam results, but also for _The System of the World_. I can't wait to see how this all comes out.cial act will be to purchase a hardcover edition of _The Confusion_.

I had the paperback edition and I kept it so long it was battered into oblivion; it's that good.<br /><br />Now it's available in a hardcover reprint that will presumably stand up under much greater battering. That's good, because this one is absolutely a keeper.<br /><br />This volume collects the absolute cream of short SF from 1929 to 1964 and it is, to this day, still THE single finest such collection extant. There's still nothing to touch, e.g., the bone-chilling mojo of Tom Godwin's 'The Cold Equations' or the majestic hubris of the title character in Ted Sturgeon's 'Microcosmic God'.<br /><br />If you have any interest in classic SF, this book undoubtedly deserves a prominent place on your shelf.

I rather hope it's the last.<br /><br />In the first place, this book suffers from extremely poor editing. That may not be Walsh's fault; the book is assembled from his lectures, and I gather from other sources that the state of his health may not have permitted him to do his own transcribing and editing. Still, it's a very patchy job by whoever _did_ do it -- with jarring shifts into informality, odd grammatical constructions, and annoying repetitions of major points.<br /><br />There are also errors that somebody didn't catch. For example, on p. 182, while trying (sloppily) to maintain (incorrectly) that the Kantian notion of 'duty' exemplifies 'the Judeo-Christian ethic', Walsh refers to W.D. Ross's _Foundations of Ethics_ -- but calls it _The Principles of Ethics_. A small complaint, perhaps, but this is not the only such blunder.<br /><br />In the second place, the book's title has little to do with its content. There's hardly anything here about the role of religion in history; the book is little more than a summary of what the major religions are about, as construed from a (more or less) Objectivist point of view.<br /><br />In the third place, it's far from clear why anyone would care what Objectivists think of religion, any more than one would care what tone-deaf people think of music. What could Objectivism possibly have to say on this topic?<br /><br />Very little, it appears. Objectivism, we recall, is the philosophy of Ayn Rand -- who denied that the well-being of people other than oneself is in any way a direct source of normativity; insisted that Christianity demands the 'sacrifice' of greater values to lesser ones; and objected to God on the grounds that His existence would pose an insurmountable obstacle to man-worship. One would expect a discussion of religion from such an outlook not to be especially enlightening.<br /><br />And one would be right. Here, from the very first page, is Walsh's definition of religion: 'a system of beliefs and practices resting on the assumption that events within the world are subject to some supernatural power or powers such that human needs, either physical or psychological, can be satisfied by men's entering into relations with such powers' [p. 3]. I shall leave it to the reader to deal with this definition, but by my lights it exemplifies what Rand herself would have called definition-by-nonessentials.<br /><br />Now, granted, Walsh goes considerably farther than many Objectivists -- this isn't saying much -- in at least trying to understand the views of non-Objectivists; indeed that's probably what got him ejected from the movement in the first place.<br /><br />But apart from some sketchy history, Walsh never really comes to grips either with religion itself or with its influence on history or philosophy. Oh, there is a bit of elaboration on the views of this or that religious tradition and some interesting discussion of the occasional philosopher. But when it is all boiled down, it doesn't tell us anything we can't learn better elsewhere. And importantly, Walsh doesn't even present arguments for the Objectivist dismissal of religion; apparently he simply assumes that the reader knows those arguments and agrees with them.<br /><br />The book really adds little to the Objectivist view of religion with which we're already familiar from Rand herself (and Leonard Peikoff's nasty piece 'Religion In America', reprinted in _The Voice of Reason_). In the final analysis, Walsh takes 'religion' to be based on what Rand called the 'primacy of consciousness' as opposed to the 'primacy of existence' -- and I say 'opposed' advisedly, as Objectivism takes these two as representing a genuine dichotomy. (I argue in my own book that they do not; Rand's 'arguments' on this point are question-begging, self-serving, and just plain wrong.)<br /><br />In general, then, this book is a sermon written for the choir, and not a very good one at that. It's not so much that Walsh's 'insights' are always mistaken (though they are questionable at times, and rarely very penetrating even at their best); in fact I cited Walsh's book myself in an article I wrote a few years ago (on the role of reason in Judaism). It's that even when they're right, they're usually presented carelessly and even flippantly, as though Walsh is simply poking fun at his subject in the company of people he knows will agree with him.<br /><br />Some of this is just the informality-of-tone problem I mentioned above -- but not all of it. Even with competent editing, the problem would remain; a good deal of this dismissive, epistemologically-holier-than-thou snideness is just built in to the philosophy itself. Since Objectivists already (think they) _know_, on the basis of Rand's footless arguments, that 'religion' is just wrong from scratch, all that really remains to be discussed is how in the world people could be so silly. This sort of village-atheist condescension is hardly likely to impress anyone with the scholarly profundity of the Objectivist movement. (Nor is Walsh's little teeny tiny 'bibliography', which includes exactly 22 items, about a quarter of which seem to have been culled from the late Gordon Stein's Rolodex.)<br /><br />This book is therefore not recommended as a source of information about religion; for that, Huston Smith's _The World's Religions_ already exists and is far, far superior to the present volume. (And it is _a fortiori_ not recommended as a source of information on its nominal topic.) But as a source of Objectivist _views_ of religion, it might come in handy.<br /><br />The amazing thing is not, of course, that tone-deaf people write _good_ books about music. It is that they have sufficient hubris to write on the topic at all -- let alone to claim, on the basis of their tone-deafness, that there is no such thing as harmony.is a sermon written for the choir, and not a very good one at that.

This review is for the second edition.<br /><br />Here's all I'll say about the content: the revised and expanded edition, just like the first, is an extended argument for keeping The Dream alive. If, like me (and, obviously, John Bassett McCleary), you know there was something more to 'the Sixties' than a bunch of kids getting stoned and having sex, then you'll appreciate this book not only as a reference but as a 'tickler file' for your psyche.<br /><br />The main thing is, what's new in _this_ edition? Well, there are about fifty more pages of text. (The official page count has risen from 663 to 704. But the page numbering has also been adjusted: the entries, which used to start on page 12, now start on page 1 and the forematter is numbered with lowercase Roman numerals. By my count that's an increase of 52 pages.) As you'd expect, some entries are new and others are longer than they used to be.<br /><br />But probably the most important thing for you to know is that McCleary and/or his editor (Joan Jeffers McCleary) have gone over the earlier edition carefully and fixed the errors that have been noted in some of the earlier reviews of this book. There was, for example, some extraneous material included in the very first entry ('A'); now it's gone. The others -- all the ones I know about, anyway -- have been corrected.<br /><br />The McClearys deserve a big round of applause for the quick turnaround time. (The first edition is only two years old.) In my original review I rather unwillingly deducted maybe half a star for that stuff; it was obviously the result of deadline pressure, but this is still a reference book and factual mistakes count. In this review I'm happy to give the half-star back.<br /><br />Everything else I said in my earlier review still applies. As McCleary writes, our society threw the baby out with the bathwater in rejecting hippie ideals; what's most important here is to recognize the 1960s as a period of _experimentation_. Anybody who wants to devote some thoughtful attention to the results of those experiments will find plenty to think about in this book. There's a lot here, but there's nothing you need to 'believe' -- just take it seriously enough to let it roll it around in your mind for a while.<br /><br />With this edition a cool book has gotten cooler.

(That's why you'll find e.g. John Steinbeck, John Cheever, and E.B. White represented in it.) He also favored stories that hadn't already been anthologized.<br />His primary criterion, though, was that each story be a certain sort of fantasy written to a high standard of quality. As he states in his introduction, he was looking specifically for stories that 'show[] us the unreality of reality' and 'entertain us with our precarious state of equilibrium'. The fantasies he therefore chose are some of the most _haunting_ tales that were available at that time.<br />The time was 1952, so quite a few more have been written since then. But Bradbury was right to call the stories 'timeless', and right also to regard them as stories for 'today _and tomorrow_'. For today, fifty-plus years on (and thus well past 'tomorrow' by the usual standards of the paperback publishing industry), I still have a copy of this marvellous collection and I am still haunted by the same stories that haunted me some thirty-odd years ago (when I first read it).<br />Robert M. Coates's opening story, 'The Hour after Westerly', is one of those. There's nothing overtly 'supernatural' or 'fantastical' about the tale at all; it's a simple and straightforward account of an odd memory lapse suffered by Davis Harwell as he drives from Providence RI to New Haven CT -- the sort of thing that happens to all of us all the time. And there isn't even really a 'resolution' in a traditional sense; as the story closes, the truth sits out there somewhere in the murkiness, tantalyzingly beyond grasp. And to this day I've still read very few short stories that have hovered around the edges of my mind for so long afterward. (Another is George R.R. Martin's '&quot;. . . for a single yesterday&quot;' -- anthologized in _Epoch_, which you will probably also like if you like this collection.)<br />All the stories are of similar quality. Oh, not all are equally haunting; my other personal favorites in this respect include Sidney Carroll's _None Before Me_, John Keir Cross's _The Glass Eye_, and John B.L. Goodwin's _The Cocoon_, and your mileage may vary. But Bradbury exercised exquisite taste here -- even having the wit to include Franz Kafka's _In the Penal Colony_, which at that time had been available in English translation for only about three years.<br />This collection really is timeless. If it sounds interesting to you, scare up a used copy; you won't be disappointed.br />All the stories are of similar quality.

I haven't read any of Steve Stirling's other novels (yet), but I know who he is and I've had him on my to-read list for quite a while. I'm glad I started with this one.<br />Murray Leinster launched this whole alternate-history thing a half-century and more ago with his short story 'Sidewise in Time'. Since then there have been lots of attempts -- some successful, some not so much -- to render convincing alternate and/or parallel histories; Ward Moore's _Bring the Jubilee_ is probably one of the best known, and Harry Turtledove is generally regarded as the reigning king of the genre.<br />Stirling holds a place of honor as well, and this book illustrates why. It's a well-researched, well-paced, well-told adventure tale that involves a good deal of plausible alternate history but doesn't depend on it at the expense of characterization and plot.<br />The setup is nice. In 1946, John Rolfe VI, a WWII veteran living in California, does something in his basement with a shortwave set -- and suddenly one end of his basement is covered with what looks like a wall of liquid mercury. On the other side is . . . well, you'll just have to read it and find out, won't you?<br />Suffice it to say that what happens next has some long-term consequences. We check in on them in 2009, when fish and game warden Tom Christiansen is investigating some illegal activities involving a whole lot of ivory and a live California condor. Among the evidence he and his team collect, there's an odd photograph (clearly a fake, right? Riiiiiight) of some Aztec priests wearing Grateful Dead T-shirts . . .<br />And the rest is (alternate) history. No spoilers; all the stuff I've mentioned here is in the first twenty pages of the book.<br />I like Stirling's style, too. He makes me think of Jerry Pournelle (who is credited in the acknowledgements, and who has previously done some cowriting with Stirling). In fact the narrative tone reminds me a bit of Pournelle and Niven in _Lucifer's Hammer_, although I'm not sure I could say exactly why.<br />Anyway, a nice read and one of the finer entries in recent SF.

This one's kind of an odd entry in the Heinlein catalogue, but it's less odd if we recall that he wrote some fantasy/horror stuff in the early 1940s.<br />Ostensibly it's a sword-and-sorcery adventure/fantasy. But since it was written by Heinlein, it overturns and undoes quite a few of the usual fairy-tale cliches. The ending, for example, exemplifies Heinlein's own non-fairy-tale take on what really constitutes living 'happily ever after'.<br />The Hero is one Evelyn Cyril 'E.C.' (and eventually 'Oscar') Gordon, a veteran of a long and unpopular war in Vietnam. (Major prognostication success here: remember, Heinlein published this in _1962_. And the Heinlein who had devoted _Starship Troopers_ to exploring 'why men fight' manages to deal pretty sympathetically here with the corollary question of why some don't.) Gordon hooks up with a Heroine -- Star, Empress of the Twenty Universes, who needs some help recovering the Egg of the Phoenix.<br />Heinlein gets to show off his swordsmanship a bit (like David Lamb, 'The Man Who Was Too Lazy to Fail', he was a champion swordsman at the naval academy). He also gets to have a little fun with a monster or two.<br />And -- it wouldn't be Heinlein without this part -- he takes the reader on a guided tour of some cultures whose mores differ from those of Middle America, by way of illustrating that (most) morals are _customs_ relative to time, place, and social milieu.<br />Well, it's a pretty enjoyable romp through a world of fantasy, and there's enough of Heinlein's signature on it to keep it interesting even for those of us who aren't into the dungeons-and-dragons stuff. But _Lord of the Rings_ it ain't, and this sort of thing is definitely not Heinlein's strength.<br />Readable, pleasant, diverting, and fun, and it's right on the money in its exploration of the _sense of adventure_. Nothing really groundbreaking, though, and it's interesting mainly because it's Heinlein.	2004-03-26

Most of it is fun to reread.<br /><br />The protagonist here is an Artificial Person (AP) named Friday Jones, who works as a courier for the organization headed up by Hartley 'Kettle Belly' Baldwin (last seen in the 1949 short stort 'Gulf'). Friday's very cool all around but she has a little self-esteem problem owing to the fact that much of the world thinks APs aren't genuinely human.<br /><br />Well, of _course_ they are; they're genetically engineered to be able to outperform us ordinary mortals in strength, speed, and intelligence, but they're human (genetically and otherwise) all the same. (So you should ignore reviewers' comments describing Friday as a 'cyborg'. She's no such thing.) And that's really the heart of this novel -- Friday's long and sometimes excruciating journey to _belonging_. (In this respect, the novel very nicely _undoes_ all of the Uebermensch crap Heinlein wrote in the 1940s.)<br /><br />That's the heart, but the novel has a couple of spots on its soul. As other readers have noted, Friday's response to her rape (and her rapist) is more than a little jarring, and I don't think it's possible to explain it away as a result of her upbringing and genetic enhancements. And I could have lived without the several pages of astrogation and starcharts (although I do enjoy Heinlein's little doodle of a centaur).<br /><br />The sequence of events starts off well enough, but it sort of rambles and meanders. Oh, well; most of it is interesting, anyway, although the secret-agent intrigue peters out partway through. And there are memorable characters -- nothing quite at the level of the Long family, mind you, but still some pretty interesting people.<br /><br />Plus there's some extremely cool stuff in the background. Heinlein the prognosticator scores especially well here, creating a fictional analogue of the Internet (in 1982) and setting his tale against a backdrop of corporate infighting and political Balkanization that is almost never, but should be, credited in histories of cyberpunk.<br /><br />I like it -- at least well enough to reread it fairly often.

But you'll want to get around to it eventually, because (a) you should read it before you read the marvelous _To Sail Beyond the Sunset_, and (b) it's really not that bad.<br /><br />Oh, you have to be really into Heinlein in order to appreciate it. As in _Friday_, the cool intrigue at the beginning peters out partway through and never quite comes back. (It does get resolved to a degree at the end, but in my view not very satisfactorily.) So you have to be prepared to enjoy a few hundred pages of character interaction and dialogue.<br /><br />If you like the way Heinlein handles such things, you'll like this; otherwise not. Me, I like Col. Colin Campbell a.k.a. Richard Ames, and I like Gwen Novak, so I enjoy their company (and their arguments, and their lectures).<br /><br />Some readers have had misgivings about the ending, but I don't mind it; besides, if you have trouble figuring out what happened, you'll find out in _To Sail Beyond the Sunset_. The real problem here is that the first two-thirds of the novel is two-thirds of a good novel, the last third is one-third of a good novel, but they're the good parts of two different novels.<br /><br />You'll see what I mean if/when you read it; I can't explain it any further without giving things away. But do read it if you like Heinlein; it's better than you've heard.<br /><br />(It's also a sequel of sorts to _The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress_, which you might want to read first, mainly because you'll want to read it anyway, since it's the finest SF novel ever written by Heinlein or anyone else.)	2004-03-26
730845:US	52474360	R3LM5ROH7FFQR1	044167402X	44071865	Podkayne Of Mars	Books	3	7	12	N	Y	I say it's spinach	And if it were anybody but Heinlein, I'd say the hell with it.<br /><br />All right, look -- between 1959 and 1964 Heinlein wrote what I regard as his three _preachiest_ books: _Starship Troopers_, _Farnham's Freehold_, and this one. _Troopers_ and _Farnham_, whatever their flaws (and I think _Farnham_ is a much, much worse book than _Troopers_), were about subjects in which Heinlein had some expertise -- respectively, military service and surviving a nuclear attack. But Heinlein was never a _parent_ anywhere but in his dreams.<br /><br />And yet -- in this sorta-juvenile novel ostensibly about young Podkayne Fries of Mars but actually, albeit indirectly, about her younger brother Clark -- there he is up on his soapbox, blaming Mom for not staying home with the kids. _That_, y'see, is why the terrible thing happens to Poddy at the end, and why Clarkie is turning out to be such a sociopath: their mother was just too busy with her _career_. (As an engineer.)<br /><br />_Which_ terrible thing happens to Poddy depends on which ending you read. As Heinlein originally wrote it, she died; as he _re_wrote it (at Putnam's behest), she was merely comatose, with every hope of recovery. In the most recent PB edition of the novel, both endings are included, along with a bunch of comments/votes from readers who had much stronger feelings about the matter than I do.<br /><br />Call me an ol' sourpuss, but I don't even especially _like_ Poddy. She's sorta cute in a late-50s kiddie-lit way, but the folks who say this book is dated are entirely right. Frankly, I don't really care one way or the other about the ending.<br /><br />Not that there isn't any good stuff in this book at all. The plot's okay, and Clark really doesn't strike me as all that terrible a kid (he certainly isn't any worse than young Woodie Smith). But geez, the heavy-handed stump-sermonizing is just impossible to take with a straight face. (How many kids did Heinlein raise? If you guessed 'zero', you are exactly right. Few of us actual working parents out here really need his advice on the subject; fewer still deserve to be blamed by his surly moralism.)<br /><br />Not, then, one of the Master's finest works. But just because it's his, it has enough interesting stuff in it that I reread it once in a _very_ long while.exactly right.

731997:US	52474360	R27VQAOZ1NLN9F	0441359175	340611713	I Will Fear No Evil	Books	4	93	105	N	N	Good; should have been great	I probably like this book far better than it deserves; if so, it's because I imprinted on Heinlein's stuff during my formative years. At any rate, this novel is based on a terrific concept but suffers from flawed execution.<br /><br />The concept: Johann Sebastian Bach Smith is ooooold. Oooooooooold. He's going to die soon. But he's also rich, and he wants to spend a huge chunk of his fortune having his brain transplanted into a younger body. This he does. ('Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death . . . ')<br /><br />Well, the joke's on him. The body -- as he learns after the transplant is performed -- is not only female, it's the body of his beloved secretary Eunice Branca (who was killed in a mugging that conveniently left her in brain-transplantable condition, and who conveniently happened to have the very same rare blood type as old Smith). So Johann has to learn how to be female, and also has to get over feeling just terrible about taking over Eunice's body.<br /><br />Ah, but the lucky fellow gets some help. Turns out Eunice's body is still inhabited by Eunice -- or maybe Smith is hallucinating her (perhaps as her body rejects the transplant?). Or maybe it doesn't matter which; reality is slippery that way. (' . . . I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.')<br /><br />_Great_ concept. The idea alone is worthy of a Hugo.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Hugos aren't given for ideas; they're given for execution. And the execution here is troubled.<br /><br />Heinlein suffered from life-threatening peritonitis during this period of his life, and his wife Virginia had to help him out with the editing on this one. At that, Heinlein claimed to have trimmed the draft MS by some ungodly number of thousands of words, and the result is _still_ sort of saggy in places. Like, between the covers.<br /><br />There are minor indications throughout that this isn't Heinlein's best-thought-out work. Here's my personal favorite example: when Johann, in Eunice's body, decides on a name, he suggests using 'Joan' but giving it the 'two-syllable pronunciation'. Apparently the author forgot that his character was _speaking_ the name, so that her listeners (who were not reading the text but hearing her speak) would _hear_ the two syllables; what they wouldn't know was how she intended to _spell_ it. (And what, by the way, would have been wrong with spelling it 'Joanne'? Then we wouldn't have had to worry about reader-vs.-listener at all, and I wouldn't have to keep reminding myself all the way through the blinkin' book that it's _not_ pronounced 'Jone'.)<br /><br />Lots of the content is very dated, too. And it's not very realistic to imagine Joan Eunice spreadin' 'em for every big strong han'some male who treats her nice. (Including attorneys and judges, who might have had some ethical issues here. And please don't email me any lawyer jokes on the subject; believe me, I've heard 'em.)<br /><br />But there's still lots of cool stuff. The dialogue (especially the _internal_ dialogue, of which there is naturally a long ton) is about as well handled as it could be. Eunice's 'stenodesk', allowing for time and fictional extrapolation, sure looks a lot like a modern desktop computer (in about the way that D.B. Davis's 'Drafting Dan' looked like a CAD system). There's also what must be one of SF's very first sympathetic fictional portraits of a same-sex couple -- and, lurking in the background, some references (in 1970!) to what is clearly the Internet.<br /><br />So I still rate this one as a rewarding read (and in fact do reread it every now and again myself). It's not Heinlein's best; it's not even his second-tier material -- but it's still pretty darned good.<br /><br />It's just not _great_. And that's too bad, because I'd have loved to see what Heinlein could have done with this concept had he been at the top of his game.ving it the 'two-syllable pronunciation'.

What an ending to his career.<br />(The title is a reference to a line in Tennyson's 'Ulysses', having to do with accomplishments in old age, and it's undoubtedly intended to describe what Heinlein himself was up to here. He succeeded.)<br />A word of warning, though -- if you didn't like _Time Enough for Love_, stay away from this one. Even (if possible) more than its predecessor, this one just oozes s-e-x, including wife-swapping, incest, and other stuff probably not in conformity to the mores of your tribe. In my view, it's all very tastefully and responsibly handled, but then my own opinions on such matters (including my devout antigrundyism) were in large measure informed by massive reading of RAH during my formative years. Just be aware that the usual suspects have dismissed this novel as pornographic trash.<br />At any rate, this novel was clearly a labor of love for Heinlein. In it, he gets to revisit the world of his childhood (or close to it; he actually has to start a bit earlier than his own birth).<br />You see, it's the story of one of Heinlein's most compelling heroines: Maureen Johnson Long, of the Howard Families, mother (and co-wife) of Woodrow Wilson Smith (a.k.a. Bill Smith a.k.a. Ernest Gibbons a.k.a. Lafe Hubert a.k.a. Aaron Sheffield a.k.a. Lazarus Long). And she lived just down the road a piece from Heinlein (and Sam Clemens, who makes a nice cameo appearance in her memoirs).<br />There's a thin shell of story around it, but most of the novel consists of Maureen narrating her life to herself (and us). We learn a lot about her unconventional childhood and her interesting relationship with her father (Lazarus's Gramp, Ira Johnson). We watch her grow up, get married (to fellow Howard Family member Brian Smith), make a home, bear children, and do all sorts of other things.<br />Of course since the stuff that happened in Heinlein's 'Future History' stories didn't actually come to pass in _our_ world (no rolling roads, for example, and our moon shot was a government affair), Lazarus and his kin must hail from an alternative timeline. And sure enough -- right around the beginning of the Second World War, we start to see events that diverge from our own history. But boy, it turns out Maureen was there behind the scenes for quite a bit of that 'Future History'; she knew Delos Harriman, was sleeping with George Strong, and provided some crucial assistance to what in her world was the first lunar landing.<br />Great stuff, filled with the wonderful narrative, dialogue, and characterization that Heinlein's longtime readers had learned to expect -- not to mention the Old Man's usual range of soapboxery and iconoclasm, in spades. And it's always good to see Lazarus again.<br />As I've said elsewhere, I credit Heinlein with three absolutely magisterial SF novels: _The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_, _Double Star_, and _The Door Into Summer_. This is one of his near-magisterial second-tier novels; it falls just ever so slightly short because I think there's a wee bit too much 'fitting Maureen into the cracks' of his previous novels.<br />Speaking of which: Be sure to read _Time Enough for Love_, _The Number of the Beast_, and _The Cat Who Walks Through Walls_ before you read this one; they form a series. At some point you'll also want to read _Methusaleh's Children_ and Heinlein's 'Future History' stories (collected in _The Past Through Tomorrow_; find a used copy). But though helpful, it's not absolutely necessary to have read them first.<br />Anyway -- this one's a keeper. I can't tell you how many times I've reread it (along with _TEFL_ and the rest). These are some of the _realest_ characters to be found in SF, or for that matter in any fiction.

But this one ranks near the bottom of my own list of Heinlein's novels.<br /><br />For one thing, he wrote this one smack in the middle of his Nuclear Rant Period, and he's very heavily into Soapbox Mode here. This was a time in Heinlein's life when he got (let's put it gently) deeply annoyed at anyone who suggested that massive nuclear buildup wasn't the way to handle the alleged Soviet threat, or that maybe surviving a nuclear holocaust might not be such a terrific thing. (Indeed, he built a bomb shelter at his Colorado Springs home -- _before_ Colorado Springs was anywhere near a likely nuclear target; NORAD didn't exist yet.) His surly attitude (not to mention his tub-thumping sermons about the Benefits of Military Service) informs this entire novel.<br /><br />For another -- and it's probably a consequence of the first problem -- _not one_ of the characters in this book is even remotely likeable. Joseph, the 'houseboy', is as close as we come to a decent human being, and even _he_ turns out to be sinister and menacing before we're through. It's hard to take sides between Hugh Farnham and his son Duke; the dad's a jerk and the son's a whiny wuss. Hugh's wife Grace is no prize either, and their daughter Karen -- apparently intended to be sweet and innocent -- just comes across as spoiled. And Barbara never gels as a character at all.<br /><br />For a third thing, even the stuff some readers _like_ about late-period Heinlein isn't well done here. For example, some readers have commented on Heinlein's apparent approval of incest. That shouldn't be news; _all_ of Heinlein's works stand in part for the proposition that moral standards are relative to time and place, and there's quite a bit of (authorially approved) incest in his later works. Nevertheless, _here_ it just doesn't work: in the context of _this_ family (hardly one of Heinlein's freewheeling horny-redheaded-genius open marriages), Karen's remarks to Hugh on the subject just sound out-of-place and weird.<br /><br />This one belongs next to _Expanded Universe_ on the shelf of books that could well have turned me off to Heinlein if I'd started with them. It's not without merit -- again, there's some interesting social commentary and speculative future history, and I can't fault the patriotic intent -- but for my tastes the merits are far outweighed by the flaws.theless, _here_ it just doesn't work: in the context of _this_ family (hardly one of Heinlein's freewheeling horny-redheaded-genius open marriages), Karen's remarks to Hugh on the subject just sound out-of-place and weird.

Heinlein kept experimenting right up to the very end; this is his last novel but two, and the final two were just as daringly experimental.<br />This one is essentially a retelling of the story of Job, with Alexander Hergensheimer as the put-upon protagonist. The outcome, too, parallels the story of Job, but I can't tell you how without giving away the ending. Let's just say that Heinlein borrows from, and builds on, some of his own nearly-forgotten early fantasy/horror works, particularly 'They' and 'The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag'.<br />It's also a grand homage to two of Heinlein's literary forebears  -- James Branch Cabell (_Jurgen: A Comedy of Justice_) and Samuel Langhorne Clemens ('Mark Twain'; 'Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven'). You don't _have_ to know this in order to appreciate the story, but it helps.<br />You probably already know the plot. On a bet, Hergensheimer undertakes a firewalk and comes out the other side in a different world, one in which people keep calling him 'Alec Graham'. Level One plot: Who is Graham and how did Hergensheimer come to take his place? And what's up with this world-changing business?<br />Hergensheimer is also a minister in a conservative Protestant sect, and he's married. But in his new world, he's got Graham's girlfriend: a stunning Danish beauty named Margrethe, with whom he commits all sorts of 'sins' and for whose soul he is deeply concerned (she worships Odin). Level Two plot: How does Hergensheimer handle all the moral quandaries, and how does he grow and change in the process? (I'm sure you can guess that he 'grows' toward a more Heinleinian tolerance and open-mindedness; much of the religious satire here is directed at the usual suspects, who of course denounced the book as soon as it was published.)<br />I can't say much about the Level Three plot because it has to do with the aforementioned structure of the biblical book of Job. However, I will tell you that readers who think that structure falls apart in the end don't know Job as well as they think they do. If you're still puzzled after you read (Heinlein's) _Job_, you may want to skim over the excellent introduction to Stephen Mitchell's fine translation of the (Hebrew) book of Job. At any rate, it has to do with the nature of reality and what's really of the most central importance to human beings.<br />Note: there's a little bit (by a Heinleinian standard, i.e., compared to 'a lot' in his other late-period works) of preachery here, and also a little bit (by the same standard) of sex; none of it (i.e., neither the preaching nor the sex) is in conformity to the moral codes of the major branches of Protestantism. Neither will surprise or bother any of Heinlein's regular readers, but both will probably upset the targets of Heinlein's satire.

But this one is very close.<br />As I'm sure you know already, it's the tale of a young fellow named Thorby, a slave on the planet Sargon who comes under the protection of one Baslim the Cripple. A sort of outer-space version of Kipling's _Kim_, the novel traces Thorby's life and development through several changes of venue -- and ends on Earth, where Thorby finds out who he really is and takes on some heavy, adult-sized responsibilities.<br />It's a very well handled coming-of-age novel, and it expresses Heinlein's own remarkable take on maturity very nearly as well as _Tunnel_ (in some ways arguably better). And like _Tunnel_, it devotes _just a little_ space, toward the end, to preaching against straw men. (Here, it's a couple of custard-headed pacifists whose sole literary function is to mouth inane slogans that Heinlein wants to show up as irresponsible nonsense. There was _loads_ of such stuff in _Starship Troopers_ but in this one it's kept to a minimum.)<br />It also shares part of its 'skeleton' with _Stranger in a Strange Land_ (on which Heinlein was also working at about the same time, still under its provisional title 'A Martian Named Smith'). Why, there's even a climactic courtroom battle, with Thorby represented by a crusty lawyer not terribly unlike Jubal Harshaw. (In general lawyers don't come off well in Heinlein's novels; in the final analysis the sharklike Garsch is no exception, although Harshaw fares somewhat better.)<br />At any rate, the anthropological insights come fast and furious here (aided in part by a character who may remind you of Margaret Mead). One nice touch is revealed in Thorby's time with the Traders; like every other people in history, they call themselves 'the People' and everybody else subhuman ('fraki').<br />No s-e-x, though. At this time Heinlein was still publishing under the watchful eye of Alice Dalgliesh and Thorby's interactions with the opposite camp are as chaste as melting snow.<br />I credit Heinlein with three absolutely magisterial works -- _The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_, _Double Star_, and _The Door into Summer_. This one belongs to the second tier of near-magisterial material, well worth reading and rereading despite a few warts.her people in history, they call themselves 'the People' and everybody else subhuman ('fraki').<br />No s-e-x, though.

Well, he'd certainly earned them; while reporting to John W. Campbell, he all but singlehandedly founded the genre of modern science fiction, and in the course of a fifty-year writing career he created some of the most memorable characters in _any_ sort of fiction. It is no exaggeration to say that without his contributions, human beings would probably not yet have set foot on the moon. And at the personal level, he was capable of genuinely courtly behavior.<br />Among the contributors is (of course) Spider Robinson, reprising his over-the-top 'Rah! Rah! R.A.H.!' and following it up with a piece entitled 'Robert'. You may find portions of these a little hard to take even if you like Spider (as I do); they're a bit much even as eulogies.<br />(In my own view, they rather miss the point of the handful of responsible criticisms of Heinlein, although they're pretty much on the mark as regards some of the silly ones. In general Spider is a warmly humane writer, and the only subject on which I've ever seen him become unpleasant is in defense of Heinlein -- either directly or in promoting an idea he acknowledges learning from Heinlein.)<br />Other contributors include Tom Clancy, Poul Anderson, Joe Haldeman, Greg Bear, and other SF luminaries. And of course Virginia Heinlein is on hand as well. There's even a most gentlemanly comment from Arthur C. Clarke. And the volume is edited by Yoji Kondo, who made a cameo appearance in _The Cat Who Walked Through Walls_.<br />(Conspicuously absent from the wake is Isaac Asimov, who had known Heinlein considerably longer than the majority of the contributors. Well, if you've read Asimov's comments on Heinlein in e.g. _I. Asimov: A Memoir_, you can probably do the math.)<br />There are also some selections from Heinlein's hard-to-find early writings (including one or two that haven't been published before), and several of his speeches. These are nice to have, and not just for their interest as mementos of Heinlein's early career. They're of interest for another reason as well -- one not so flattering to Heinlein.<br />As deeply as I've admired Heinlein's fiction, I've never been a fan of his nonfiction. Partly this is a matter of tone; his tub-thumping pronouncements of custardheadedness just rub me the wrong way. But partly it's a matter of competence as well. There are certainly _some_ subjects he was competent to discuss, but he didn't limit himself to discussing those.<br />In particular, on _philosophical_ subjects he was talking through his hat. I'll defer to his opinions on ballistics and mechanical engineering, but not on epistemology and ethics; on those subjects, he simply didn't know what he was talking about (even though he continued talking about them for the rest of his life, e.g. in his interview with J. Neil Schulman).<br />I find him extremely hard to take when he sounds off about the alleged silliness of philosophy, especially when he then proceeds to propound much greater silliness himself. Generally, people who dismiss philosophy as pseudointellectual bunk are thereby _adopting_ a philosophical position themselves -- typically, an unreflective, allegedly 'hard-headed', highly controversial, and deeply inconsistent form of 'scientific' empiricism. Not only was Heinlein entirely typical in this respect, he tended to misuse the very terminology of the philosophies he thought he was discussing. (See his 'definitions' of the words 'phenomena' and 'noumena' in the aforementioned interview with Schulman.)<br />To disabuse yourself of his reliability in ethical philosophy, you'll have to look elsewhere; there's not much discussion of it here. (If reading _Expanded Universe_ didn't convince you Heinlein wasn't trustworthy on that subject, you must have skipped two-thirds of it. Or else you're Spider Robinson, who seems to have been far more impressed by that book than I was.)<br />The fun stuff here is in epistemology. Check out those old speeches: as long ago as 1941, Heinlein was touting Count Alfred Korzybski as a greater genius than Einstein and trying to expound General Semantics to an audience of SF writers and fans. As I've said elsewhere, Asimov's status as the Great Explainer was never in any danger from RAH.<br />Just as an intellectual exercise, it's fun to go through this stuff and try to count the errors. I'll get you started with a hint: if it's true that we're never justified in claiming to _know_ a universal generalization, what's the epistemological status of _that_ universal generalization?<br />(Did I hear someone in the audience say 'De mortuis nil nisi bonum'? But Heinlein's own Col. Dubois insisted that it was not only okay but ethically mandatory to heap scorn on inexcusably silly ideas wherever they appear.)<br />At any rate, this volume functions not only as a tribute that Heinlein richly deserved, but also as an antidote to readers with a tendency to put the guy on a pedestal and ignore his intellectual bumptiousness (and mean-uncle surliness). In that capacity it belongs on the shelf next to _Expanded Universe_, Schulman's book, and _Grumbles from the Grave_.inson, who seems to have been far more impressed by that book than I was.)<br />The fun stuff here is in epistemology.

Don't make it your second or third, either. (And don't make it your _last_.)<br />Heinlein wrote this book right after recovering from a carotid bypass. Those of us who had been reading his stuff for a while were thrilled to see it (I remember lapping it up when it was serialized in _Omni_ magazine), largely because it meant he hadn't been permanently rendered unable to write.<br />And there's certainly stuff here for Heinlein readers to appreciate. Some readers don't like Heinlein's dialogue, but I like it just fine and I enjoy the interplay among the four main characters in this one. (Nor do I have any trouble telling which of the characters is narrating at which point.)<br />This is also the novel in which Heinlein sets up the concept of the World-As-Myth. Apparently tired of listening to his characters invite one another to 'have a go at solipsism', he finally has a go at it himself -- and comes up with a 'multiperson' version of it, in which various 'real' universes are 'fictional' relative to one another, yet accessible via six-dimensional rotation using a nifty device invented by protagonist Jake Burroughs. (At the very least, this clever trick allows Heinlein to bring together lots of his characters from his various fictional worlds and let them all have free-love open relationships with each other.)<br />The downside is that it's somewhat self-indulgent. First we visit some of the fictional worlds created by several of Heinlein's own favorite writers. On top of that, the name of every one of the 'bad guys' is an anagram of some variant of Heinlein's own name, or Virginia's, or one of his several early noms de plume. Then, in a very confusing ending, we're sort of given to understand, more or less, that all of them are Heinlein himself, somehow, maybe. My, what a powerful fabulist he must therefore be.<br />Back to the plus side. Readers of _Time Enough For Love_ -- those who liked it, anyway -- will cheer the return of Lazarus Long, as this novel not only brings him back (together with some new members of the Long family) but sets up two further novels in which he appears (_The Cat Who Walks Through Walls_ and _To Sail Beyond the Sunset_; don't start with _those_ either). Of course this is a plus only for those of us who _did_ like _TEFL_; those who didn't won't care for this book either.<br />Interesting late-period Heinlein, then, filled with what Heinlein fans will regard as great characters and great character interaction -- but somewhat bloated with some stuff that doesn't make very good sense and shot through with some extremely trivial intellectual puzzles. (Most of the anagrams aren't very hard; even the one or two comparatively difficult ones won't pose major problems for anyone who knows anything about Heinlein's [and Ginny's] naval service.) The casual Heinlein reader probably won't like it and won't grok it.<br />It's not my favorite either, but I don't think Heinlein wrote any _bad_ fiction. (His nonfiction is another story.)

(Same copy, too; the old dollar-ninety-five Putnam edition has held up amazingly well. Different nightstand, though.)<br /><br />I was born in 1963 and learned to read very early. Like Spider Robinson, I lost my literary virginity to Heinlein (in my case, to _Stranger in a Strange Land_ and _The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_). To this day I think that _Mistress_ is one of his three absolutely magisterial novels (the other two being _Double Star_ and _The Door into Summer_).<br /><br />Heinlein also wrote a number of novels that were _very close_ to magisterial, and some of them have been (in my case, at least) more profoundly influential than his Three Greatest. _Stranger_ is one of these, and so is _Time Enough for Love_.<br /><br />Heinlein published this one after bouncing back from major surgery (having been somewhat incapacitated while writing _I Will Fear No Evil_, which his wife Virginia helped to edit). The old master had his off days, but he's at the top of his form here.<br /><br />As you're probably aware, this lengthy work is a future history of Lazarus Long (born Woodrow Wilson Smith), the Senior of the Howard Families and the oldest human being alive (well over two thousand years old at the time of this tale). Lazarus is one of Heinlein's best realized characters; I'd recognize his red hair, bulbous nose, disarming grin, and wild grey-green eyes if I passed him on the street.<br /><br />And I'd immediately put my hand over my wallet. Lazarus is an unsavory character -- a raconteur, swindler, adventurer, sybarite, pragmatist . . . and, above all, _survivor_. He exemplifies everything Heinlein thought it would take for humanity to spread to the stars (besides the Libby-Sheffield Para-Drive, of course), and his amoral self-interested practicality is what's kept him from _getting_ killed even if (as is suggested in this book) he got an initial boost from a mutation in his twelfth chromosome pair.<br /><br />But boy, you're going to want to haul off and whack him, because he's an ornery, slippery old scoundrel.<br /><br />He's a helluva lot more colorful than Valentine Michael Smith (Heinlein's other attempt to create an character who could comment on human culture from the outside and let Heinlein indulge in some fictional iconoclasm). And he's a helluva lot more fun.<br /><br />Plus you'll get to meet the rest of the Long family (including two or three -- depending how you count -- sentient computers).<br /><br />And Lazarus's reminiscences include several marvelous tales that could have stood as novels in their own right: the Tale of the Man Who Was Too Lazy to Fail, the Tale of the Adopted Daughter (a glorious story that also features the Montgomerys, the most chillingly realistic 'bad guys' anywhere in Heinlein's entire oeuvre), and the Tale of the Twins who Weren't. (And there are two sets of Excerpts from the Notebooks of Lazarus Long -- collections of aphoristic musings that Heinlein readers liked so well that they've actually _been_ published separately.)<br /><br />The result is a long (no pun intended) meditation on what it takes to survive -- and why anyone would want to.<br /><br />I read this book when I was ten, and I'm afraid it wasn't altogether a 'good influence' on me. (If you want to know, ask me privately sometime -- and I don't promise to answer truthfully.) If you're tired of 'good influences', try reading it. I've got my issues with Heinlein, but he's one of the great iconoclasts of the twentieth century.<br /><br />For that very reason, some readers should _avoid_ this book; it's guaranteed (and indeed designed) to offend you by rubbing your nose in the fact that your mores are _not_ 'natural laws'. But if you're the sort of person who will enjoy Heinlein, you'll dive right into this one and never come out.<br /><br />Lazarus had previously appeared in _Methusaleh's Children_ and reappearsin three further late-period Heinlein novels (_The Number of the Beast_, _The Cat Who Walked Through Walls_, and _To Sail Beyond the Sunset_). But if you want to meet him, I'd recommend starting here: the later ones won't make sense without this one, and I don't think _Methusaleh's Children_ represents Heinlein's best writing.<br /><br />This does. The whole thing is wonderfully staged; the narrative switches back and forth between voices, the dialogue just crackles, and the action (when there is any) will make you jump off your seat once in a while.<br /><br />This is Heinlein in control of his craft.

You won't agree with my five-star rating unless you're in the publisher's target audience, so be warned: my rating is _not_ based on 'literary quality' and your mileage will _definitely_ vary.<br /><br />Strictly, I have to count myself one of those 'Children'. I was born in 1963, learned to read very young, and cut my literary-intellectual teeth on _Stranger_ and _Mistress_; moreover, this fact is so significant in my personal development that it's something you _must_ know if you want to grok the way my mind works even today, some forty years later. (Spider Robinson remarks somewhere that RAH was the one who took his 'literary virginity'. Same here.)<br /><br />So whatever issues I may happen to have with the Old Man -- and believe me, I do have some -- I'm most definitely one of the readers at whom this book is aimed. And I highly recommend it to any of Heinlein's _other_ Children out there. To the rest of you, it will be at most of historical interest, so wait for the paperback.<br /><br />If you're reading this page, you already know what the book is: it's Heinlein's first novel-length writing (though Robinson's introduction suggests that it may not be a 'novel' proper). You've probably already read the comparisons with Edward Bellamy's _Looking Backward_ and H.G. Wells's _When the Sleeper Wakes_.<br /><br />Here I'll simply confirm that those comparisons are apt; Heinlein's unpublished 1939 work, a look at the 'past' from an imagined future, is essentially a sociopolitical tract wrapped up in a bit of story to make the medicine go down a little more easily. The protagonist, Perry Nelson (whose double-admiral name is presumably a two-gun salute to a couple of Heinlein's naval forebears, though neither the MS nor the commentary explicitly makes this connection), is basically a cardboard figure, and so is his companion-of-the-future Diana.<br /><br />_As_ a tract, it's pretty interesting. As a story, it's not very, and although there are occasional hints of the writer Heinlein was to become, you wouldn't notice them if you weren't familiar with his later work. What's _really_ interesting is something that will appeal only to those 'Children' of his. I've thought through my entire shelf of Heinlein novels and I can't think of a _single one_ that doesn't have _some_ roots in the ideas set forth in this manuscript. Why, there are a few elements here that don't resurface until _Stranger_.<br /><br />Most of us have long suspected (hell, known) that the Old Man was deliberately lecturing us in those books of his, no matter how many times he swore up and down that his sole purpose was to entertain. (And no matter how many times his most zealous defenders insisted we couldn't infer anything about Heinlein's own opinions from those of his characters.) But until this MS was published, we didn't have much direct evidence that Heinlein himself accepted and wanted to propagate the ideas set forth by, say, Col. Baslim, Col. DuBois, Jubal Harshaw, Professor de la Paz, and Lazarus Long.<br /><br />You may not buy all of those ideas yourself; I don't either. But anybody who grew up reading Heinlein's stuff has to credit him for stretching our minds so far out of shape that we will never, as long  as we live, lapse into simple-minded moralistic conventionality. About anything.<br /><br />(The 1960s owe much of their experimentation with convention to a handful of famous and not-so-famous minds from the previous generation or two; Lord Bertrand Russell was one of the famous ones and Paul Blanshard -- twin brother of philosopher Brand Blanshard -- was one of the not-so-famous. Heinlein is on that shortlist; without _Stranger_, much of the ensuing decade wouldn't have unfolded quite as it did.)<br /><br />I also don't mean to suggest that Heinlein's ideas didn't change _at all_ over the next fifty years. Certainly they did; at the very least, as he himself remarked in the late 1950s (and as Robert James reminds us in his afterword), he turned from a 'soft-headed radical' into a 'hard-headed radical, a pragmatic libertarian'. But those radical (and libertarian) themes had been present in Heinlein's writing from the very beginning; in Spider's apt analogy, this MS contains their DNA. In his life as a fiction writer, Heinlein had to wait another twenty years before his ideas even became publishable -- and even then it was largely because he had personally laid the groundwork for them.<br /><br />His predictions herein are in some cases uncannily accurate, but he flops in one surprising and deeply ironic respect: as of 2086 there _hasn't yet been a moon landing_. Hee hee. (But in 1939 Heinlein successfully predicted both Hitler's suicide and the development of a united Europe with its own currency. The details are wrong, but still . . .)<br /><br />Don't skip the 'Social Credit' economic arguments either. If you disagree with them, see if you can spot where they go wrong (if they do).<br /><br />I'm generally not a huge fan of Heinlein's nonfiction writings and I'm very, very glad he turned to fiction. (Even on strictly scientific matters, Asimov's reputation as the Great Explainer was never in much danger from RAH.) Nevertheless I think that in its treatiselike aspects, this 'novel' is one of his best _nonfiction_ works. At the least, the underlying theories are better thought out than in any of his later nonfiction.<br /><br />But overall, what will be of interest to the 'Children' is that in this MS, we can see Heinlein (in the language that Robinson borrows from Zelazny's _Lord of Light_, as he does whenever he wants to talk about something like this) put on his Aspect and raise up his Attribute. This MS dates from the time that Heinlein _became_ the writer of speculative fiction that drove us to the Moon. Reading it is like stepping into a time machine and going back to meet a young John Lennon picking up his first guitar.<br /><br />If you're one of Heinlein's Children, don't miss this MS.

But I do enjoy a good cyber-nano-crypto-geno-neuro-psycho-techno paramilitary/espionage corporate-dystopian noir-SF thriller. In addition to all the obvious names in recent SF, I also like Tom Grace and Dan Brown.<br />With this book, Joseph Finder has made my shortlist.<br />Naturally there's only so much I can tell you without spoiling the surprises. It's a well-written, tightly paced tale of corporate espionage; Finder nails the narrative voice, keeps the thing moving along briskly, and gets the technical and legal background right without bogging down in details. He's a fine writer and he's done his homework.<br />That homework makes _Paranoia_ surprisingly realistic in a number of major respects, Oh, sure, some of the corporate intrigue is fictionalized, simplified, or exaggerated. But anyone who thinks corporations just don't do this sort of thing at all is living in a dream world. Anybody who's even been near the outskirts of a corporate grudge match can tell you that Finder has the flavor right.<br />I'd tell you why I deducted a star, but I can't air my few minor misgivings without unsacking the proverbial feline. So I'll just say that there are a couple of points that won't bear much retrospective scrutiny after the last twist has been taken.<br />Nevertheless Finder will keep you reading -- and interested -- until the very end. (I plowed through it in less than a day.) It's a nicely crafted piece of fiction, and it's not an accident that it's been touted as this year's _Da Vinci Code_. Brown's readers will probably like this one too.	2004-03-14

Morgan is one _helluva_ writer.<br />This book has been available in the UK for the better part of a year, and having been thoroughly impressed with Morgan's first book, I've been eagerly awaiting the US release of his second. I am _so_ not disappointed.<br />You'll recognize the backdrop; it's the same corporate-controlled dystopian future we've seen in pretty much every cyber-nano-crypto-geno-neuro-psycho-techno-noir SF novel since Phil Dick founded cyberpunk and forgot to insist on receiving credit for it.<br />But Morgan isn't just recycling familiar themes here, any more than Beethoven imitated Bach by using some of the same notes. Morgan has his own outlook, his own themes, and his own voice.<br />If you've read the introductory plot summaries elsewhere on this page, you already know everything I could tell you without spoiling things. Suffice it to say that Takeshi Kovacs is back and in excellent form. Here, he's initially serving with Carrera's Wedge, deployed on Sanction IV against an uprising led by one Joshua Kemp, when he's approached with -- and accepts -- a surprising offer.<br />_Broken Angels_ not only has a fine plot of its own but fills in some more of the backstory for _Altered Carbon_. Nor is it a rehash of its hardboiled-PI predecessor; this one's military SF, more along the lines of _The Forever War_, with which it shares some abstract themes and narrative flavor.<br />That narrative flavor alone makes the book worth reading. Morgan is such a powerful writer that even if you get bored with the action (not likely), you can enjoy yourself by just sitting back and watching the prose crackle. (But don't look away for even a single paragraph; you'll miss something.)<br />In short, _Broken Angels_ will appeal to readers who liked _Altered Carbon_ but who don't expect Morgan to keep rewriting the same book over and over. _Very_ well done, and it belongs on the very shortest shortlist of good recent SF.	2004-03-14

'	The screen version of this classic SF novel is less an adaptation than a counterargument. In a way that's appropriate; Heinlein was certainly trying (or at least expecting) to generate loads of controversy with this work. But if you're about to read _Starship Troopers_ for the first time, it's only fair to warn you that _whatever_ you think of the film, you'll be disappointed if you expect the book to resemble it very much.<br />(Director Paul Verhoeven and screenwriter Ed Neumeier took incredible liberties with, and sometimes even directly contradicted, the book on which their film is 'based'. It's a fine film on its own terms and I think it's been unjustly maligned. But it's not this novel; it's the next round in an ongoing dispute with this novel. And whatever else the movie has going for it, its _military_ action is incompetent to the point of silliness.)<br />I've been reading Heinlein for nearly forty years now. I don't think this is one of his best three or four novels, and it's never going to be one of my personal favorites either. Nevertheless, it _is_ a genuinely great work of SF and raises issues that genuinely deserve to be raised.<br />Whether you buy Heinlein's own _answers_ is a different matter. The 'arguments' presented by the characters in the novel are mostly aimed at straw men. ('My mother says violence never settles anything', indeed.) This is perhaps forgivable since so much of Heinlein's positive case is so good. But I'm not persuaded that the society he imagines in this novel would be as functional as he seems to think.<br />At any rate, its essential socio-political point -- that authority and responsibility are a coordinated yin-yang pair and an imbalance between them puts the world out of whack -- is extremely well taken. (It applies more broadly, too.)<br />Its account of what it means to be a human being (as opposed to an economic animal) is darned good too. And this is where the real meat of the novel lies.<br />You see, the _story_ here isn't about the war with the Bugs; it's about Juan Rico's coming of age. As a character (not Rico) remarks at one point: 'I had to perform an act of faith. I had to prove to myself that I was a man.' If you grok that, you'll grok the novel. (Yes, Heinlein tells this story in the context of military service, but its theme applies much more widely. And lest you think the novel is too autobiographical here, note that Heinlein -- a Navy man -- locates his story not in his own branch of the service but in the 'poor bloody infantry'.)<br />The stuff about the Bug War is a different deal. This aspect of the novel was very much a product of the anticommunism/Cold War era; I don't think it's survived all that well and I'm not even persuaded it was all that terrific at the time. But it's background, not main plot -- and at any rate Heinlein is surely right that a cap trooper in the Mobile Infantry isn't going to be involved in setting the Federation's diplomatic policy; Rico's own story doesn't depend on whether the politicians are 'right' to send him into combat.<br />One of Heinlein's greatest, then, but not the absolute cream.

I disagree; I think it's terrific.<br /><br />John Perkins's Ki Chuan Do ('way of the spirit fist') isn't just a 'martial art'; this is real, practical, hardassed Taoism in action, the kind that trains your body to move like a mind. Even apart from the close-combat stuff, just doing the exercises -- even for a few days -- will make a palpable difference in how you inhabit your body and navigate your environment. (Try the Ninja Walk and the Vacuum Walk for a couple of days and watch your balance improve -- even if it's already pretty good. Combat aside, this stuff is helpful to e.g. hikers who go on difficult trails. Of course this sort of balance/awareness is a kind of 'self-defense' in a hiking context too.)<br /><br />The martial-arts portion is probably not for me to judge, but it makes good sense. Essentially, what Perkins is trying to do is teach self-defense to people who actually want to defend themselves. In order to do that, he's cut to the chase, omitting all the formal stuff that makes sense in a dojo (where you can count on your 'opponents' to fall courteously when you throw them) and taking you straight to the awareness/body-unity stuff (which will help keep you alive and kicking when your friendly neighborhood mugger ungenerously refuses to give you time to assume your favorite fighting stance).<br /><br />If you're already training in a martial art, you don't need to _stop_ or anything; Perkins's 'guided chaos' will simply help you apply your training in a more realistic context. But if you're not already training in one, I think you can feel safe in starting here. Perkins's purpose is, after all, to help beginners develop close-combat skills as rapidly as possible.<br /><br />As with other martial arts but perhaps even more so, the preferred aim in Perkins's Ki Chuan Do is not to go around beating people up but (as Sun-Tzu also recommended) to avoid violence by never letting it start. Perkins doesn't advise fighting unless you're backed into a corner, and he doesn't hesitate to advise running the heck away if it's at all possible. (All in all, Perkins's book fits well with Gavin de Becker's _The Gift of Fear_ -- a book that, incidentally, appears in Perkins's list of recommended reading.) The most devout peacenik (Perkins's apt phrase is 'pacifist warrior') should be able to get behind this approach.<br /><br />But make no mistake, if you _aren't_ able to get away from an attacker, Perkins wants you to fight like a brain-damaged wolverine on PCP. And he shows you how.<br /><br />He accomplishes this not so much by showing you specific blows and such (which he does, but you can learn about most of them by reading e.g. Fairbairn) but by helping you get your body in the right frame of mind, if you know what I mean. His exercises are designed to bring you to a condition in which you don't need to _stop and think_ for that crucial fraction  of a second that might make the difference between life and death.<br /><br />And if you don't have the stomach to deal with e.g. biting, eye-gouging, and scratching, skip this book. It's not for people who enjoy violence, but it's also not for people who refuse to use it even in self-defense.<br /><br />Underneath it all (and sometimes on the surface too) is a deep layer of philosophical Taoism -- not at the level of a college-freshman late-night purple-hazed bull session, but the kind that you grok in your kishkes or not at all. You can read it all you want, but you won't 'get' the Taoist bits if you don't _do_ at least some of the exercises.<br /><br />The book _is_ fun to read, though. Perkins and his collaborators are delightfully iconoclastic and generally good company all around. The well-written text is also accompanied by plenty of genuinely helpful photographs.<br /><br />I'm not competent to decide whether Perkins's approach is appropriate for everyone (although I suspect it is). But if his approach sounds suitable to you, don't stay away from the book _just_ because you're a beginner. That's exactly who Perkins wrote it for.yone (although I suspect it is). But if his approach sounds suitable to you, don't stay away from the book _just_ because you're a beginner. That's exactly who Perkins wrote it for.	2004-02-05

Some of us who saw the lunar landing in 1969 are still wondering why we haven't gotten to Mars yet. Shouldn't that have been next?<br />Well, it still could be, and you can get more information on the possibilities by checking out the Mars Society and Red Colony websites. (I can't post the URLs here but in each case your first guess will be correct.)<br />And if you want more information on the planet Mars itself, this is the book you want.<br />Packed with gorgeous photos from the various Mars missions (and some from Earth for purposes of comparison and inference), this book is a garden of delights for areophiles: the very latest information and theories about the red planet, interspersed with the reminiscences and personal views of the author, astronomer William Hartmann, all in a very high-quality glossy paperback designed for long shelf life -- and, one hopes, for interplanetary travel.<br />If you've ever wondered what gives Syrtis Major its dark color, or even if you've just looked at the night sky once in a while wondering what the heck might be _out there_, you'll find something to engage you in this volume.<br />Have a look. Then let's start getting ready to go.	2003-10-22

If not, check it out; I can't post the URL here but a quick search will turn it up.<br />This book is a collection of some of the very best pictures from that marvellous site. Most of the pictures are images of Very Cool Stuff from around the cosmos: comets whacking into Jupiter, galaxies forming, that sort of thing. And wow, it sure is _big_ out there.<br />The stuff close to home is fascinating enough in its own right that the book pays for itself with just the images from within our very own solar system. The shots of the other planets and their moons are culled from the various flyby missions and, naturally, they are _way_ better than anything that was available when I was a kid.<br />There are a few that are _very_ close to home, and these are cool too. Some show either the Earth (from orbit) or a view of its sky (during the Hale-Bopp visitation, for example). A handful are of other things entirely (including one of the most effective Magic Eye pictures I've ever seen).<br />They are all of them stunning, captivating, and gorgeous. If you aren't pretty much transfixed by this stuff, then you and I probably aren't from the same homeworld.<br />And the short commentary that accompanies each image was written by a qualified, competent astronomer.

But if you can think of two, this is probably the second.<br /><br />Although never as big a Clarke fan as I've been of Asimov and Heinlein, I still have fond memories of several of Clarke's books. _Rendezvous with Rama_ is probably his best novel and it's been one of my favorites of his since it was first published. His short stories, too, are generally of high quality (remember e.g. 'The Nine Billion Names of God'?).<br /><br />The series of tales collected herein is a bit different (for Clarke). For one thing, they're _funny_ -- Arthur C. Clarke funny, that is, not Douglas Adams funny, but funny all the same.<br /><br />They're on the light side and they're deftly executed. But don't expect guffaws; in order to appreciate Harry Purvis and his stories, you pretty much have to be the sort of person who thinks 'The Defenestration of Ermintrude Inch' is a funny title.<br /><br />If you've read Clarke but you haven't read this book, grab a copy and see what you think. The 'White Hart' isn't Callahan's, but it's a pleasant place to hang out and listen to some tall tales.	2003-09-21

This was the text; I still have my copy. (Autographed by the author, in fact; I met him on a visit to his university, where I subsequently attended grad school.)<br />The title of this book states, accurately, that its subject matter is 'elementary topics _in_ differential geometry'. This is one of those 'transition' books that introduces students familiar with Subject A to a more-or-less-systematic smattering of elementary topics in Subject B. Here, Subject A is multivariate calculus and Subject B is, of course, differential geometry.<br />Since that's what this book is for, there are way more numbers and pictures in it than you'll ever see in a modern graduate-level differential geometry text. The idea is to show the student the geometric meaning behind all the advanced calculus and help him/her understand _both_ words in the name 'differential geometry'. In short, much of the motivation here is geometric.<br />I liked it a lot and I am still grateful for its highly accessible introduction to a fascinating field. However, I must also add that its approach is not representative of any graduate-level math course I ever took. Of course this is an undergraduate text and isn't supposed to represent graduate-level coursework. Nevertheless, it _may_ give a student the wrong idea about what to expect in more advanced treatments. (Is there some personal history lurking behind that remark? You guess.)<br />An excellent 'transitional' book, then, and highly recommended to readers who want to connect their knowledge of multivariate calculus to the geometry of Euclidean space. It's also a fine example of an expository work on mathematics that remembers its target audience. However, as other reviewers have commented, it needs some answers to the exercises in order to be really useful for self-study.	2003-09-20

I used this one about twenty years ago as a supplementary reference in a graduate course, and I still have my copy.<br />Everybody with some mathematical background knows the name of Paul Richard Halmos. I saw him speak at Kent State University while I was an undergraduate there (some twenty-odd years ago); to this day I remember the sheer elegance of his presentation and even recall some of the specific points on which, like a magician, he drew gasps and applause from his audience of mathematicians and math students.<br />This book displays the same elegance. If you're looking for a book that provides an exposition of linear algebra the way mathematicians think of it, this is it.<br />This very fact will probably be a stumbling block for some readers. The difficulty is that, in order to appreciate what Halmos is up to here, you have to have _enough_ practice in mathematical thinking to grasp that linear algebra isn't the same thing as matrix algebra.<br />In your introductory linear algebra course, linear transformations were probably simply identified with matrices. But really (i.e., mathematically), a linear transformation is a special sort of mathematical object, one that can be _represented_ by a matrix (actually by a lot of different matrices) once a coordinate system has been introduced, but one that 'lives' in the spaces with which abstract algebra deals, independently of any choice of coordinates.<br />In short, don't expect numbers and calculations here. This book is about abstract algebraic structure, not about matrix computations.<br />If that's not what you're looking for, you'll probably be disappointed in this book. If that _is_ what you want, you may still find this book hard going, but the rewards will be worth the effort.	2003-09-20

Clarke; I was mostly into Heinlein and Asimov. But I read this one when it was first published (1973) and I liked it so well I kept the hardback for years and years.<br />I'm not sure what finally happened to it, but at any rate I've just recently gotten around to replacing it. And the story is still as great a read as it was when it was new. I can't claim to have read everything Clarke ever wrote, but this is certainly the best of his works that I _have_ read.<br />Other reviewers have pointed out, entirely correctly, that this isn't a book to read for character development. That's true of Clarke's books in general, I think, but it's especially apt here, where the 'star' of the book is an artifact of an alien civilization. In fact, even the 'star' doesn't get a lot of development, since in the end it remains deeply mysterious. (I don't know what happens in the sequels; I haven't read them and I haven't heard good things about them. I'm treating this as a standalone work.)<br />But man, if you want to read a gripping, haunting story about the first human exploration of a space probe (or something) from an extraterrestrial civilization -- and if you want to watch the exploration process unfold and feel as though you're participating in the discovery yourself -- then this is a book for you. This is what Clarke does best: when you read a story through his eyes, you're looking outward at the objects of scientific investigation, and helping yourself to a chunk of the intellectual wonder and joy that goes with such investigation.<br />The excitement here is the excitement of hard science, not of character development. If that's what you want, you'll probably love this book.	2003-09-18

And Then There Were None&quot;), Robert A. Heinlein's Loonies in _The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_, and Ursula K. Le Guin's Anarresti in _The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia_.<br />Oh, there are a handful of others, notably James Hogan's _Voyage from Yesteryear_ (which was itself strongly influenced by Russell). But most of the rest are thinly disguised libertarian propaganda without a great deal of literary merit (though your mileage may vary).<br />Of these three, Le Guin's is in some ways the most compelling. In part that's because she's just such a fine writer. But it's also because she's probably the _least_ &quot;ideological&quot; of all the SF writers who have ever tackled this subject.<br />On Le Guin's somewhat Taoistic approach, each of the contrasting societies contains the seeds of the other, and she lets the reader see both their &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; points. She clearly likes the Anarresti society (and on the whole it comes off rather better than its Urrasti foil). But she doesn't hesitate to show the reader some of its critically important drawbacks. Its childrearing practices, for example, recall Ira Levin's _This Perfect Day_, and its treatment of original thinkers (and their &quot;egoizing&quot;) even recalls Ayn Rand's tub-thumpingly propagandistic _Anthem_.<br />In general, then, Le Guin is pretty well immune to the usual salvation-by-ideology claptrap. And as her subtitle suggests, her utopia really _is_ ambiguous. For her, people aren't &quot;saved&quot; by adopting the correct philosophical position or social principles.<br />Least of all is her protagonist Shevek &quot;saved&quot; by such means. Shevek is a physicist from Anarres (the moon of the planet Urras) and has grown up in its anarchist society. But it doesn't really have a place for him. Neither, more obviously, does Urras, the &quot;propertarian&quot; counterpart to Annares's communitarian society, with which Annares has had no contact for about a century and a half. So with respect to the two polar-opposite patterns of social organization, Shevek is doubly dispossessed.<br />What's the book actually _about_? Well, Shevek cooks up a plan to get the two societies on speaking terms again and, in order to pursue it, decides to leave Anarres for Urras; so off he goes, as a passenger in a ship called the _Mindful_. (And yes, do be careful not to trip over the symbolism.) That's all I'm going to tell you about the plot. But the essential theme of the novel is, I suppose, barriers and their overcoming. (The very first sentence goes like this: &quot;There was a wall.&quot; Yep.)<br />It's a very thoughtful novel. The narrative hops around in time a lot and the plot isn't exactly marked by nonstop action, so it's probably not for space opera fans. But readers of a more philosophical bent will enjoy it immensely.<br />And if you're at all interested in literary portraits of anarchist societies, make sure you read this one. If you share Le Guin's Taostic/anarchistic leanings (as I do), you'll like the Anarresti _and_ appreciate Le Guin's refreshingly anti-ideologue-ish honesty in her portrait of it..

Heinlein also wrote a handful of near-great novels as well as some third-tier stuff that I don't care about rereading. (And his nonfiction, unlike Asimov's, isn't worth the paper it's printed on.)  But these three novels are magisterial, and as close to perfect as anything he ever wrote.<br /><br />This time out, our \\"hero\\" is Lawrence Smith a.k.a. Lorenzo \\"Lorrie\\" Smythe a.k.a. \\"The Great Lorenzo\\", a self-important and out-of-work actor who, at least initially, isn't all that heroic. He's approached about a job, and it turns out to involve serving as a double for a famous statesman in a public appearance. The rest you'll have to read for yourself.<br /><br />It's a fast-moving, well-paced, meaty story, and it raises all sorts of fascinating questions about personal identity, character, and such. And Heinlein handles it all very deftly. Smith (why _are_ so many of his characters named \\"Smith\\"?) contends at one point that in order for an actor to portray a character properly, s/he has to _become_ the character, and it's impossible to do so without coming to like the character somewhat. Well, that's just what Heinlein does here with Smith himself. (Another of Heinlein's Smiths would later describe this process as \\"grokking\\".)<br /><br />Oh, there are a few soapboxy bits, but they don't interfere much with the story. For example, at one or two points we get a few pseudo-profound quotations from statesman John Joseph Bonforte that sound suspiciously like Heinlein himself at his tub-thumpingly silliest (or perhaps some lost excerpts from the notebooks of Lazarus Long, which may be another way of saying the same thing). But it's kept under control. (In other words, this is not _Starship Troopers_ or _Farnham's Freehold_.)<br /><br />This is one of Heinlein's finest and most tightly constructed tales, and almost fifty years after its publication it still holds up well. This is the master at his best -- and his best was very, very good.st -- and his best was very, very good.	2003-09-15

[The quotation is from Salvor Hardin, Mayor of Terminus.]<br />Let's say it's around 1940 or so; you're studying chemistry in grad school but your true love is history; you've read Edward Gibbon's _The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_, but writing a historical novel set in the _past_ would require just too much research; you get the bright idea of writing a historical tale set in the _future_, about the decline and fall of a _Galactic_ Empire, and you suggest as much to John W. Campbell, Jr.<br />Campbell's response: he gets excited and suggests that you introduce some pseudoscientific mumbo-jumbo about \\"psychohistory\\". Do you:<br />(a) drop the idea and write something else?<br />(b) write the story just as Campbell describes it?<br />(c) use a little imagination, make Campbell's idea a bit more intellectually presentable, and crank out, not just a single story, but a Hugo-award-winning series?<br />If you picked (c), congratulations; you're Isaac Asimov.<br />The Hugo didn't come until 1965, when the Foundation series won for best all-time series (defeating even Tolkien's _Lord of the Rings_ books). By then Asimov had long ago tired of the series; you can tell by the first part of the third book. (But the _second_ part of the third book is probably the best part of the original three volumes.)<br />And heck, even in order to keep it going _that_ long, he had to introduce a radical departure from the Seldon Plan, in which the Mule initiates not just another Seldon Crisis but a new element altogether, one that wasn't accounted for in the Plan. (And in even later installments, it becomes pretty clear that Asimov isn't exactly thrilled by either the Plan or the Empire it's supposed to bring about.)<br />But in the first volume, all of it is still fresh. Here we meet Hari Seldon for the first time, get slightly acquainted with his mathematical science of psychohistory, and learn what he's done to keep the decline of the Galactic Empire from leading humanity into 30,000 years of barbarism. He can't avert the decline, but he's got a way to reduce the period of barbarism to a mere millennium.<br />He's set up two Foundations at opposite ends of the galaxy. And he's carefully set the ball rolling so that every so often there will be some sort of sociopolitical crisis, to which there's only one possible resolution. All the Foundation has to do is wait until the crisis narrows everything down to just one option, and then figure out what the heck that option _is_ . . .<br />Well, I think you can see that the pattern leaves some room for the exercise of intelligence, but not a lot for individual initiative. No wonder Asimov let the Plan start going awry; the story might have lasted a thousand years, but the dramatic possibilities wouldn't.<br />Anyway, it's a great, great series. This is where it begins in realtime, although the later novel _Prelude to Foundation_ is \\"first\\" according to the chronology of the Foundation universe.

The other two-thirds is very good too, and every bit as hilariously funny (especially the visit to the planet Hygeia).<br />I won't tell you anything about it that could spoil the story for you. I'll just say that Russell not only envisioned a fully functional society on a foundation of complete individual liberty (based, by the way, on the exercise of volition and respect for each other's choices, not on &quot;property rights&quot;) and explained how it might work, _and_ anticipated at least the flavor of much of the 1960s counterculture.<br />The world of the Gands is my home planet.

Campbell, Jr., famously said that the two genres of detective fiction and SF couldn't be combined. He was mistaken, as Isaac Asimov eventually demonstrated for another publisher (Horace Gold at _Galaxy_) with this fine work.<br />Building on his robot stories, Asimov here introduces two of his most memorable characters: detectives Elijah Baley (a human) and R. Daneel Olivaw (a robot). In Asimov's later work, these two are going to go down in galactic history. Here, they're just solving a mystery.<br />The tale opens in a future version of New York, but despite some nods toward the \\"hard-boiled\\" genre, Asimov actually owes more to Dame Agatha Christie than to Mickey Spillane. At any rate I won't spoil it for you by telling you any more about it.<br />The main reason I'm reviewing it now, in fact, is to recommend it to readers of Richard K. Morgan's brilliant _Altered Carbon_. There's a very short line of \\"mystery SF\\", running through Larry Niven's ARM stories; it starts here. If you're at all interested in this genre, this is one you'll want to read.<br />The two sequels (_The Naked Sun_ and _The Robots of Dawn_) are excellent as well. And of course any reader of Asimov's later works knows what eventually became of R. Daneel Olivaw.	2003-09-10

It's good, all right -- but it's not very tightly unified, the writing is sloppy in places, and it introduces a few things that seem to contradict the original series at certain points.<br />What really makes this four-vignettes-plus-an-epilogue volume so engaging is that in it, Hari Seldon has clearly become a literary alter ego for Asimov himself. And Asimov was well aware as he wrote it that he hadn't long to live.<br />And _that_ suggests that in writing about Dors Venabili, Wanda Seldon, and psychohistory, Asimov was \\"really\\" _also_ writing about his wife Janet Jeppson Asimov, his daughter Robyn, and his own literary oeuvre. So completely aside from its value as an SF novel (or, really, a story collection), it's also of great interest for the light it sheds on Asimov himself.<br />Asimov is generally credited with three autobiographies: _In Memory Yet Green_, _In Joy Still Felt_, and _I. Asimov_ -- the last being my personal favorite because it's the most introspective and revealing of Asimov's character. (Excerpts from all three, plus some further surprising revelations that you've probably heard about by now, are included in Janet Jeppson Asimov's _It's Been a Good Life_.)<br />But there's a case to be made that he wrote a fourth volume of autobiography, and that this is it. At the very least, this work of ostensible fiction is almost as revealing of Asimov's character and end-of-life concerns as any of his nonfictional autobiographies.<br />For that alone, it will be of interest to every Asimov fan. May the Good Doctor rest in peace.	2003-09-10

Like Heinlein, he devoted much of his late-period writing to wrapping all of his stories (robots, the Galactic Empire, and the Foundation(s)) into one grand Future History. Although I've long been primarily a Heinlein fan, I think Asimov did by far the better wrap-up job.<br />And when I go back to reread this stuff, I pick Asimov over Heinlein more often than not. I credit Heinlein with three absolutely magisterial novels (_Double Star_, _The Door into Summer_, and _The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_), a handful more that were really really good, and a boatload of third-tier stuff I don't care if I ever read again. (And in contrast to the Good Doctor, Heinlein's _non_fiction writings were uniformly awful. In real life Heinlein seems to have had something of a nasty side that I don't care for at all.)<br />On the whole, Asimov seems to be wearing better. And his more recent novels -- like this one -- are just plain excellent.<br />This one (and its followup, _Forward the Foundation_) is way more interesting than it has any right to be. For heaven's sake, we already _know_ how the Foundation stories come out. We know Hari Seldon doesn't get killed. We know he develops psychohistory. We know he establishes two Foundations at opposite ends of the Galaxy. There just shouldn't be a whole lot of tension here.<br />And with another author, there probably wouldn't be. But in Asimov's hands, the intrinsic interest of the story carries the day. We get a fascinating tour of Trantor, a lot of Imperial intrigue, some insights into the initial development of psychohistory, and a couple of the Good Doctor's closing twists (one of which will not be altogether unexpected if you know _Foundation's Edge_ and _Foundation and Earth_). It's extremely well done and pretty much unputdownable.<br />As of the mid-1960s or so, the field of SF has been dominated by writers with more style than substance. Asimov is still one of the three or four best and greatest.	2003-09-08

But it sure is some great storytelling.<br />It's 2076, see, and Luna is a penal colony (rather like Botany Bay). Projections indicate that it's losing natural resources at such a rate that it will become uninhabitable within a small number of years. So it's time to reenact the American Revolution.<br />But this time it's led by computer repairman Manuel Garcia O'Kelly Davis, &quot;rational anarchist&quot; Professor Bernardo de la Paz, rabble-rousing rebel Wyoming Knott, and a HOLMES IV computer named Mycroft who happens to have become sentient.<br />Okay, the technological projections aren't the most accurate (even for Heinlein, who didn't average all that well anyway). But man oh man, what a story.<br />And it's narrated by Mannie himself, in a thick Lunar dialect that owes a lot to Russian (and, one suspects, to Anthony Burgess's _A Clockwork Orange_). Heinlein does a wonderful job here, keeping the tone just right throughout the entire novel and never drifting into obscurity.<br />Heinlein made his original reputation with brilliant short stories, but this novel is one of the reasons he kept it. Nearly forty years after it was written, it's still on the shortlist of the best SF ever. Don't miss it.	2003-09-08

She's supposed to start working at U.S. Robots in 2008. But as readers of Heinlein's _The Door into Summer_ know, Daniel Boone Davis has been out of Cold Sleep for nearly three years now, and his _Flexible Frank_ is presumably already giving U.S. Robots a run for their money.<br /><br />It's fascinating to watch the actual times of these stories come and go. Heinlein and Asimov have long been two of my favorite SF writers.<br /><br />The stories assembled here represent some of Asimov's best-known work. It's pretty impressive that they hold up as well as they do.<br /><br />Oh, the details are way off, but of course the stories were written in the 1950s. At any rate, what really moves these tales along is the characterization.<br /><br />Especially Susan Calvin. You wouldn't know it from reading this book, but she was Asimov's first real female lead character. He sketched her with broad, bold strokes, but he did such a fine job that she feels _real_. (She _is_ real, darn it; I've known her since I was a little kid.) The rest of the crew are well delineated too, but it's the cold-blooded robopsychologist who really shines here.<br /><br />The stories themselves are masterfully constructed and well told, as of course we long ago came to expect from the late Good Doctor. Probably most readers of this page will have heard of the Three Laws of Robotics, and some of us can even recite them from memory. Well, this is where they come from.<br /><br />If you haven't read this book yet, pick it up at once; until you've read it, you've missed some of the best classic SF there is. And you've also missed a profoundly optimistic, technophilic view of the human future: robots are, as Dr. Calvin says, \\"a cleaner, better breed than we are.\\"	2003-09-08

Such judgments are notoriously subjective and controversial. But I feel safe in saying that any SF reader will find something to enjoy in this marvelous story.<br />It's part SF, part fairy tale, and part just plain good storytelling. Engineer/inventor Daniel Boone Davis and his feline companion Petronius the Arbiter are two of Heinlein's best-realized characters; the plot here is well-conceived and evenly, swiftly paced.<br />In case you haven't read it, I won't spoil it for you. The setup is that Davis has just been rooked by his best friend and his fiancee, and he's out to do something about it. What happens then is the story itself, so I won't tell you; I'll just say that the time-travel aspect is worked out every bit as neatly as in &quot;By His Bootstraps&quot;, and the tale is one of Heinlein's most humane ever. I've read it more times than I can count, and there's a bit near the end that _always_ gets me. (You'll know what I mean when you get there.)<br />Heinlein wrote this at the peak of his talent.

Nevertheless I keep returning to the old masters with whom I grew up.<br />You know which three. Just so you know where I'm coming from: I've always been primarily a Heinlein fan and Asimov was a close second; although I've read Clarke I never really got into him too much. (Among SF writers since that time, my main loyalties have been to Spider Robinson and James Hogan, and among the _really_ recent ones I've been especially impressed by China Mieville, Richard Morgan, Neal Stephenson, and Robert Sawyer.)<br />Of the big three, Asimov undoubtedly had the highest literary output as measured in sheer wordage. I've been of the opinion for several years now that the only reason the Good Doctor stopped writing is that somebody went and told him he'd died. I have my own views about what parts of his output were of the highest quality, but there's little doubt that the Foundation series (not a &quot;trilogy&quot;; it was originally published as a series of short stories and novellas) is among his best known.<br />(He's also known, of course, for his famous robot stories. Long before the current generation of cyberwriters started screaming mouthlessly and crashing snowily, Asimov was writing compelling tales of mechanical intelligence on the presumption that such technology was on _our_ side. And like Heinlein -- and with just as little credit among modern writers -- he anticipated the recent explosion in information technology. For Heinlein, see especially _Friday_; for Asimov, drop by Trantor and visit the Galactic Library.)<br />He had secured his place in SF history fifty years before his death. But (again like Heinlein) he spent some of his later years tying up his better-known works into one big future-history package (including not only his Foundation stories but also his robot stories and his Galactic Empire novels). I think he did this more successfully than even Heinlein did.<br />This one -- _Foundation's Edge_ -- was his first return to the world of the Foundation stories after some thirty years. In it, he began to address a big fat problem he had left at the end of the original series of tales: how come the First Foundation bought so easily into the fabrication that the Second Foundation had really been defeated and dismantled, when in fact it hadn't?<br />Now, I have to say at once that purely _as_ a Foundation novel, this one probably isn't the most satisfying of the bunch. In fact both _Prelude to Foundation_ and _Forward the Foundation_, (excellent novels both, by the way) include _much_ more interesting Foundation-y stuff. But the very points that make this one weak as a Foundation novel also make it strong as an SF novel.<br />You see, it's hard to write really engaging novels about Hari Seldon's science of psychohistory, because the science itself is supposed to be statistical and to work only in the abstract with large masses of human beings. That fact means that a good psychohistory tale is bound to focus on broad historical forces at the expense of individual character development. Indeed, even in the original series of stories, Asimov had to introduce a radical departure from the Seldon Plan (via the Mule) in order to generate a really compelling human-interest tale.<br />This novel is probably among Asimov's best in terms of character development. That's one of the reasons I like it best as a novel; it's probably that I tend to empathize with the rebellious Golan Trevize (and to some extent with the equally mavericky Stor Gendibal) and to enjoy hopping around the galaxy with these guys nearly as much as with Lazarus Long.<br />Unfortunately that's also why it doesn't advance the ball much as far as Foundation history is concerned. _Prelude_ and _Forward_ are filled to the brim with scientific research, Imperial intrigue, and cool plot twists; this one is more ofa character piece. It's not that nothing interesting or significant happens; far from it. It's just that the cool stuff mostly doesn't involve the outworking of the Seldon Plan.<br />At any rate, the Good Doctor was an expert at telling an engaging tale and keeping the reader involved until the very end. I, at least, have found this to be one of his most unputdownable (and the two Foundation prequels are darned close).<br />I didn't like _Foundation and Earth_ as well (and I'm not sure Asimov served the series terribly well by trying to tie in all the robot stuff), but I hope it returns to print so that I can buy a replacement copy.a character piece.

I'm very, very happy to say that this one lives up to its promotion. China Mieville is a powerful writer and this is a powerful book.<br />The characters are fascinating. Isaac and Lin, for example, are not your ordinary couple (he's human and she's khepri; he's an academic maverick and she's an artist who has rebelled against her hive and moeity). And the plot gets rolling with a visit from an even more remarkable being: Yagharek, a garuda whose current full name is Too Too Abstract Individual Yagharek Not To Be Respected and who has had his wings clipped because he has forgotten that being a concrete individual requires a certain type of social matrix (take _that_, Ayn Rand!).<br />The culture is just as fascinating, especially the interspecies stuff. You'll be horrified by the treatment of the Remades (one of Mieville's greatest strengths is his keen sense of how amazingly skillful and imaginative human beings can be at inflicting misery on one another). And if you're anything like me, you'll find yourself tempted to worship Palgolak, a god of knowledge whose sole commandment is to read voraciously for the sake of learning.<br />But the real star of the novel isn't any of the characters. It's the city itself -- New Crobuzon, which surely ranks among the most fully realized cities in all of SF. It's certainly not any city on earth (and the city it _mainly_ isn't is London). Mieville brings it to teeming, roiling, seamy, stinking life with the sheer power of his account. The plot meanders a bit, the action is sometimes slow, but you won't care, because this city is _alive_ and you are _there_.<br />This novel is every bit as good as you've heard it is. Along with Richard Morgan's stunning debut _Altered Carbon_, it leaped quickly to the top of my shortlist of the best new SF I've read in the last decade.	2003-09-03

This is one of the best I've seen.<br />If you want to learn how to use cryptography yourself, you'll want Bruce Schneier's marvelous _Applied Cryptography_ at some point. But if you want to find out what the fuss is about and what, exactly, cryptography has to do with information security, you'll find this introduction very, very helpful.<br />What's nice about it is that it not only gives you a fairly painless introduction to the essential concepts of cryptography, but also informs you in a reliable way about the importance of cryptographic protocols in electronic information exchange. It starts at the beginning _and_ gets you through to the meaty infosec stuff; even if you're an absolute beginner, by the time you reach the bits about e.g. digital certificates and public key cryptography and secure email and so forth, you'll actually be in a position to understand it.<br />Highly recommended to lawyers, law students, and other infosec newbies.	2003-09-03

If your aesthetic sensibilities have been informed, directly or indirectly, by Kernighan and Ritchie's influential book on C, you'll know what I mean.<br />I've been programming computers in various capacities since I was in my early teens (the mid-1970s) and I've been through a number of languages. Not long ago I discovered Python, and I suspect I won't need to learn any other languages for quite a long time. Guido van Rossum is a wizard.<br />If you're interested in learning Python, don't start here. If you've got some programming background already, Guido's tutorial (which comes bundled with the Python download) will be enough to get you rolling. I personally recommend all of O'Reilly's books on the subject (_Learning Python_ for the absolute beginner, Mark Lutz's idiosyncratic but highly useful _Programming Python_ for the next level up, the magisterial _Python Cookbook_ for pretty much anybody, and the _Nutshell_ book to be placed permanently next to your keyboard). There are others as well, and after you've gotten started, you'll be a better judge than I am of what will be most useful to you. (But I'd skip the vastly overpriced and not-very-deep _Python Programming Patterns_ unless you can buy it used.)<br />This one's for later; although it does offer some beginning instruction in Python, it isn't really an introductory book. However, if you do any text processing with Python -- which you almost undoubtedly do if you use Python at all -- then you _do_ want this book even if you don't know it yet.<br />Most of what you'll want to know is in chapter two, which sets out the basics of string processing in Python. The other, fancier stuff in the later chapters may be handy sometimes, but author David Mertz himself will tell you not to overcomplicate things; if you can do what you need to do using string operations, do so.<br />Read the rest of it too, though. There's good stuff here on e.g. regular expressions and parsing that you'll find interesting and possibly useful. Just don't rush out and start trying to apply it when it isn't necessary.<br />Mertz is an excellent teacher. He tends to approach things from a foundation of &quot;functional programming&quot; -- of which I'm not particularly a fan, but he has a healthy sense of its limitations and his comments on the subject are refreshing. (If you're interested in functional programming, get a book on Haskell, which is actually a very cool language. But me, I like imperative languages just fine and I don't have any problem with &quot;side effects&quot; as long as they're deliberate or at least controlled.) At any rate, Mertz won't lock you in to a functional approach, but he will teach you some function-oriented stuff that will be useful to you no matter what your preferred programming style.<br />And his exposition is well organized and wonderfully lucid. If you're the sort of person who likes books that have a chapter zero, you'll enjoy his style.<br />Unless you have a strong programming background, then, you probably won't want to start your Python bookshelf with this one.

It very nearly makes it.<br />To readers of this sort of literature (that is, dystopian cyber-nanotech-SF), the world of this novel will be familiar in feel if not in detail: the northern part of the world is under the control of corporate .Coms, who lord it over the working classes, and the southern part is free, though living underground in the aftermath of some sort of destructive conflagration.<br />Jolie Sauvage is an engaging enough heroine as far as she goes. A young guide who takes rich aristos on tours of the uninhabitable surface, she surprises herself by falling for Jin, a northern actor and the son of a major .Com exec. Her narrative can be a bit taxing at times; she knows about six French phrases and uses them repeatedly throughout the novel. But she's a pleasant enough companion.<br />There's a good idea lurking in this &quot;hyperthought&quot; stuff, too. It never quite comes out where we can see it (and evaluate it), but it's there and it works for dramatic purposes.<br />The timbre of the novel reminds me of Octavia Butler (which I mean to be a good thing; Butler is a very powerful writer). If you liked _Parable of the Sower_, you'll probably be drawn into M.M. Buckner's aesthetic sensibilities as well.<br />This is a fine debut novel.

The author bio indicates that he taught English as a second language for some fourteen years; he can teach a thing or two to us native speakers as well. His narrative and his dialogue are clean, crisp, and focused, with that sense of heightened reality you get from really good fiction; there's not a word out of place, and there's none of the mannered artificiality of e.g. Frank Herbert's _Dune_.<br /><br />But it's even better than good writing. Morgan has applied his craft to a brand of fiction that one of the cover blurbs describes as a cross between hard-core cyberpunk and hard-boiled detective fiction. That's an odd description of the genre and makes it sound newer than it is, but it's true that there hasn't been a lot of SF detective fiction. And Morgan's contribution advances the ball considerably.<br /><br />If you're at all familiar with the genre, you're already thinking of Larry Niven's ARM stories (and maybe, though less aptly, of Asimov's _The Caves of Steel_ and _The Naked Sun_). Well, Morgan's world does owe something to Niven's, but he's got very much his own spin. His main character (Takeshi Kovacs), though arguably more Mike Hammer than Hiro Protagonist despite the snowcrashy backdrop, will remind longtime fen of the wisecracking tough-guy heroes that have populated SF since at least the days of Keith Laumer (not to mention Harry Harrison's Stainless Steel Rat). But he's not just a carbon copy (even an altered one).<br /><br />And Morgan has found a very interesting way around a problem that has plagued detective fiction since its inception: when your narrative is written in the first person, how do you keep the reader from figuring out that the narrator doesn't get killed? Oh, you can do a Jim Thompson and have the character narrate his own death, but otherwise there aren't too many possibilities.<br /><br />Morgan has discovered one. As you'll learn within the first few pages, Kovacs has _already_ died at least once, and there's nothing to keep him from dying again, perhaps repeatedly; for reasons that will be clear early on, his death wouldn't keep him from narrating the novel.<br /><br />The plot is ingenious: it seems that one Laurens Bancroft has committed suicide, but Bancroft himself believes he was murdered and hires Our Hero to investigate. (Yes, you read that correctly; the alleged murder victim wants to know how he was killed.) Beyond that, I'm not going to tell you anything that might spoil your fun.<br /><br />I _will_ tell you to keep your eyes peeled for a huge number of incredibly cool background details. Like Heinlein, Morgan drops you into the middle of the tale and introduces you to its world in the natural course of the narrative, rather than calling attention to it tourist-fashion. In the process he mentions lots of nifty things that could have been entire novels in their own right (and John W. Campbell would have loved every one of them) -- e.g. computer-automated hotels that upgraded to sentience and bought themselves out from under corporate ownership. Morgan's throwaway ideas are better than most SF writers' main plot points.<br /><br />I'll also tell you that, as one or two other reviewers have pointed out, there's some fairly graphic sex in this novel -- not to mention some vivid and disturbing violence. It's extraordinarily well-written and I thought it was all quite tastefully handled. But if you haven't got the stomach for such stuff, be warned.<br /><br />_Very_ highly recommended. If you've spent the last decade or two wondering where all the really good SF has gone, check this one out.

In the process he mentions lots of nifty things that could have been entire novels in their own right (and John W. Campbell would have loved every one of them) -- e.g. computer-automated hotels that upgraded to sentience and bought themselves out from under corporate ownership. Morgan's throwaway ideas are better than most SF writers' main plot points.    I'll also tell you that, as one or two other reviewers have pointed out, there's some fairly graphic sex in this novel -- not to mention some vivid and disturbing violence. It's extraordinarily well-written and I thought it was all quite tastefully handled. But if you haven't got the stomach for such stuff, be warned.    _Very_ highly recommended. If you've spent the last decade or two wondering where all the really good SF has gone, check this one out. It's already on my best-of-recent-SF shortlist, alongside some Alastair Reynolds, China Mieville, Neal Stephenson, and a very small handful of others.	2003-08-31

The former looks with disdain on customers/users/clients, the latter wants to inform and empower them.<br /><br />In computer programming, for example, the elitists are the \\"data priests\\" who think of users as somehow subhuman and refuse to design interfaces that ordinary human beings can operate or even make sense of. The populists are people like Guido van Rossum, developer of the eminently usable programming language Python (and yes, that's a plug).<br /><br />There are elitists in the legal profession too, who don't want people to rely on self-help or even to know what the law actually is. Their arguments are usually couched in terms of protecting the public (who, although this is never quite stated explicitly, are presumed to be just too stupid and ignorant to make informed, intelligent decisions without lawyers to tell them they're wrong). But the effect -- as with any legally protected cartel -- is simply to close off the legal profession to anyone who hasn't got enough time and money to jump through the hoops, thereby jacking up attorneys' fees.<br /><br />That's where Nolo Press comes in. I like Nolo a lot; for thirty years they've been doing business in direct opposition to \\"legal elitism\\", by trying to bring reliable legal information directly to their customers and, if not always obviating the need for an attorney, at least giving people a solid foundation for _deciding_ whether to pay for a lawyer. Indeed, their website contains a lot of useful information that you can get _free_; I can't post the URL here but it's \\"nolo\\" with the usual suffix.<br /><br />And I think highly of the sixth edition of their desktop reference on intellectual property law. I'm forty years old and in my fourth year of law school, specializing in IP law, and with a couple of misgivings to be stated shortly, I think this is a fine, fine reference.<br /><br />It covers the four major areas of intellectual property law: trade secrets, copyrights, patents, and trademarks. There's one big section devoted to each of these areas; each section includes a short introductory discussion in Q&A format, a big fat alphabetical glossary, and the actual text of the relevant (federal) statutes.<br /><br />The discussion is clear and intelligible, and the sixth edition is updated with up-to-the-minute accounts of stuff on which the ink is barely dry -- the latest on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, for example, and the Supreme Court's March 2003 decision in the _Victoria's Secret_ trademark dilution case. This isn't just a nice self-help reference; it's a volume that law students could probably profit from. (And so could reporters who presume to _write_ on technology law for newspapers and magazines.) The glossaries alone will be helpful in making sense of the sometimes bewildering jargon of IP law.<br /><br />The one real oversight I spotted is its failure to deal with state-level \\"common law copyright\\" in unfixed works, one of the few sorts of work for which the federal Title 7 _doesn't_ pre-empt state law. Contrary to the opinion even of quite a few lawyers, fixation isn't a requirement for copyright protection; (_authorized_) fixation is specifically a requirement for _federal_ copyright protection. Improvisational works, for example, are still protected under state copyright even though they haven't been \\"fixed\\" (and even if they were recorded without the performers' authorization).<br /><br />Moreover, I note two misfeatures: the absence of an index, and spotty coverage around the edges of the fields in question.<br /><br />This book badly needs an index, or at least an analytical table of contents. [LATER EDIT: The author has written to me to let me know that -- in part owing to this very review -- the book DOES contain an index starting with the seventh edition. So you can ignore the rest of this paragraph.] The alphabetical glossaries are terrific, and they're very useful when you want to look up a specific term or when you just want to browse. But they're nowhere near as handy when you need something specific and you don't already know what it is. A list of contents is needed here. (This isn't as big a drawback as it may sound; the glossaries are sufficiently well cross-referenced that you can open them almost anywhere and follow the \\"related entries\\" pointers to the topic you want. But the book isn't as useful as it could be.)<br /><br />Then too, the book is a little uneven on subjects that are on the margins of intellectual property law. There's some stuff on the law of unfair competition, but there isn't much on privacy and publicity rights. Nor is there much on the law of _protectible information_ in general.<br /><br />I wasn't, for example, able to find even a single mention of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Granted, this statute isn't exactly front-and-center in IP law. But it certainly bears heavily on a subject on which I expect many users to look to this volume for enlightenment: the use of computers, the Internet, and the World Wide Web in business, the associated risks to the security and integrity of information, and what the law says about them. The CFAA and a few other nearby subjects deserve at least a passing mention, even if only to warn the reader that they exist and this book _doesn't_ cover them.<br /><br />The book still gets five stars, though. It's an excellent, excellent reference. I expect readers (perhaps especially businesspeople) will be able to read it and come away with a good understanding of this highly complex area of the law -- enough, at least, to decide intelligently whether and when to pay a lawyer, if not to dispense with one altogether in every case. It is, in short, every bit as clear and useful as we expect Nolo Press books to be.<br /><br />If you're in business and you need to get a handle on IP law, try this one.

I'm prepared to accept the possibility that Holmes got to Minnesota once -- even twice, since the first trip was supposedly at the behest of James J. Hill and it makes sense that Hill might summon him again. But four or five times, with a lost MS every time, is stretching it a bit.<br />Nevertheless the most obvious objections don't tell against this particular tale, even if we want to be suspicious of its increasing number of sequels. So the setting \\"happens to be\\" Millett's own home turf? Well, Millett is a well-respected historian of the Twin Cities; if Holmes had been involved in a case or two in Minnesota, who would you _expect_ to come into possession of a lost MS telling the tale?<br />The tale itself is well-told and in the Watsonian style. Oh, the characterization doesn't always quite ring true (and indeed there is at least one scene that looks suspiciously as though it has been colored by Millett's own idea of comic relief). Nor is that characterization terribly deep; Sherlockians/Holmesians looking for Holmes-Watson interaction of the \\"old vintage\\" may be somewhat disappointed.<br />But let's remember that Watson was (allegedly) not writing this tale for publication; some of his usual touches may therefore be absent for entirely legitimate reasons. We may even entertain suspicions that Millett himself has fluffed up the writing a bit here and there and still accept that the MS itself may be authentic.<br />And there are enough nice touches to support the claim of authenticity. I can't tell you most of them without spoiling the story for you (they involve specific clues and false starts and such), but here's one: as Holmes and Watson investigate a series of possible arsons, they adopt the names \\"Baker\\" and \\"Smith\\" -- two trades that use fire in their practice and so are eminently suitable for a pair of investigators out to tame the red demon of the title. Millett includes plenty of erudite footnotes, but neither these nor the main text mention this little Holmesian touch; it therefore tells heavily in favor of authenticity.<br />Authentic or not, the story itself is pretty engaging. And it's told against a very realistic background, with a clear sense of the deep moral ambiguities of the nineteenth-century railroad industry. (The railroads were neither an unmixed blessing nor an unmitigated evil. They were good in some obvious respects, but the damage they did was real too -- and unfortunately the difficulty, herein described, of getting satisfaction from the courts was all too historical.) The author -- whether Watson or Millett -- keeps all this stuff in the mix without taking sides or allowing it to color the mystery itself.<br />Nicely done, then, and worth reading. And if it's a genuine Watson manuscript, so much the better.r practice and so are eminently suitable for a pair of investigators out to tame the red demon of the title.

He's also a mathematical logician of high caliber (and a magician, and a pianist, and . . . )<br />But some of his lesser-known works have consisted of philosophical reflections on a wide range of subjects (which nevertheless include a common thread that is devilishly difficult to pin down). There was _The Tao Is Silent_ (for my money, still his best); there was _5000 B.C._ (currently out of print); and just recently he's published _Who Knows?_ (which I recommend too).<br />This is one from 1980, and it's one of few &quot;older&quot; Smullyan works currently available in print. It's not a collection of logic puzzles; it's a collection of essays and short reflections of very much the same &quot;flavor&quot; as _The Tao Is Silent_.<br />As always, Smullyan is a sheer delight to read. In his hands, philosophy becomes what it should always be: a form of intellectual play (and nonetheless &quot;serious&quot; for that, although it surely isn't solemn!).<br />Get this while it's available.

And in that capacity, I count this as one of my most useful books.<br />It's not exactly about mediation, or at least it's not a how-to book for mediators. At bottom it's about how to nip conflicts in the bud by not letting the dangerous sort of conflict arise in yourself in the first place.<br />That's what makes this such a helpful book for mediators. Joel Edelman is convinced that it takes two people to let a conflict get out of hand; if _either one_ of them is ready, willing, and able to try to resolve it, it will usually resolve. And as a lawyer who helped to pioneer the field of mediation, he's got plenty of experience to support his claim.<br />There's plenty of good advice in this well-written book (and by the way, Mary Beth Crain shares credit for its well-written-ness). In essence it amounts to this: external conflicts arise because, somewhere, there's an internal conflict we've allowed to get out of hand. And in order to get it back _into_ hand, we may have to do some difficult inner work. We're generally not as self-aware, and therefore also not as aware of each other, as we probably think we are; the signals we think we're receiving from other people are often echoes of the vibes we're putting out ourselves.<br />At any rate, this book isn't just for mediators. It's for anybody at all who wants some practical/spiritual advice about dealing with, and preventing, the toxic sort of conflict -- the poison-spewing kind that demands a \\"win-lose\\" outcome. Win-win resolutions are generally possible, but only if we each take responsibility for our own thoughts and actions and don't make our satisfaction depend on what the other person does.<br />Good stuff.

Not only the back cover but the _first ten pages_ of this book are filled with glowing reviews by the representatives of today's Illuminatus Industry, praising Jed McKenna to the skies, carrying on about how marvellously enlightened he is, and crowing about how this book is Just What The World Needs Today. Man, by the time you get done reading those, you'll be ready to toss (a) the book in the trash and (b) your cookies.<br />Well, don't. In spite of all of the sell-it-to-the-seekers tub-thumping, it's actually a pretty good book. (And you have to wonder why so many of these folks have so heartily endorsed a book that heaps so much well-deserved scorn on the spiritual-fashion industry. Maybe they don't think he meant _them_.)<br />On the plus side, there's the total absence of crap on the subject of enlightenment itself. This McKenna distinguishes carefully from both religiosity and mystical experience. Neither of these, he says, has squat to do with enlightenment, which is nothing more or less than abiding nondual awareness (a.k.a. \\"no-self\\"). His no-nonsense advice on how to get there comes down to this: just keep asking yourself what's true until you know. But it's not for everybody, getting to it is pretty painful, and the cottage industry that has grown up around it is actually selling something else.<br />Well, that's nice, and his lack of bull-puckey on the subject is refreshing. Heck, enlightenment aside, he's fun to read just to enjoy a little healthy irreverence toward vegetarianism, the practice of mindfulness, and umpteen other brands of Fashion Spirituality.<br />McKenna also seems to be a pretty decent and interesting guy in his meatspace persona. Much of the narrative really just conveys the flavor of his own life and character, so it's a good thing he turns out to be reasonably pleasant company -- astringent, curmudgeonly, genially cynical, and often funny as hell.<br />On the minus side, there's the presence of a certain amount of crap on lots of _other_ subjects. For my taste, the hard-boiled lookie-what-an-illusion-busting-realist-I-am tone gets old after about the first ten or twenty pages. The Zen masters of legend are usually content to give somebody a single sharp blow with a stick; this guy goes at you with a meat axe, over and over and over and over. Readers of _Radical Honesty_ (whose author Brad Blanton provides one of the cover endorsements) may enjoy this sort of thing; I don't, and I don't find it either especially radical or especially honest.<br />And -- much more seriously -- there's _way_ too much chatter about how unreal everybody else looks to somebody in that there state of abiding nondual awareness. McKenna is constantly pointing out that from his view-from-nowhere vantage point, everybody in the world is just a fictional character in a sort of cosmic soap opera. This would be annoying enough even if it were true just as it stands, and it isn't. Sure, there's something to it, and Ramana Maharshi got some good mileage out of the truth underlying this overstatement. But to hear McKenna tell it in his Holden-Caulfield-among-the-illuminati patter, somebody with nondual awareness would be mighty hard to tell from a straight-up sociopath.<br />Don't let that stop you from reading it; just watch for the stuff that sounds out of balance. Besides, that dramatic-rhetorical stuff (which is all it is) may be just what readers of some temperaments need. Just bear in mind that real nondualism doesn't dismiss actual people as unreal or fictional; this is as much an untruth as the contrary statement that we're simply \\"real\\" just as we seem to ourselves. In Hindu terms, folks, maya is Brahma too.<br />By the way, I'm not altogether sure whether the narrative portions of the book are strictly nonfiction or even whether \\"Jed McKenna\\" is a real person (in the usual sense of the words); it's entirely possible that the whole thing is as fictional as its author says all the rest of us are anyway. It doesn't much matter, though.t doesn't much matter, though.	2003-02-16

Everybody thinks animals should be treated \\"humanely\\" and humans shouldn't cause them \\"unnecessary\\" pain. So why do animals enjoy so little legal protection?<br /><br />Building on Tom Regan's _The Case for Animal Rights_ (an excellent book that I reviewed over a year ago), Gary L. Francione argues that it's for a very simple reason: animals are regarded as _property_ under U.S. federal and state law, and \\"property\\" has no rights of its own.<br /><br />Francione says that whenever it comes to a showdown between human wants and animal pain, humans, who _do_ have \\"rights\\" under the law, almost always win -- because the game is rigged. Set off the desires of rights-bearing humans against the suffering of rights-less nonhumans whose \\"welfare\\" is taken into account for strictly utilitarian reasons, and it's incredibly easy to make a case that such suffering is \\"necessary\\".<br /><br />Francione argues his case well -- including a crucial point: he maintains that there isn't anything in current \\"property\\"-based animal law that has the effect of conferring rights on animals anyway. This point is more controversial than some readers may be aware; other writers on this subject (e.g. Gary Varner) have argued that other species _do_ have de facto \\"rights\\" under U.S. law and have had them at least since the Endangered Species Act of 1973. If they're right, Francione's argument is in need of serious shoring up if he is to show that the _absence of rights_ is the real problem for nonhuman species.<br /><br />At any rate he illustrates his main point twice: once in general (using the history of animal cruelty statutes) and once specifically (using the history of animal experimentation and the effects -- or otherwise -- of the Federal Animal Protection Act). I think his arguments are pretty sound, but they're extremely important either way.<br /><br />One crucial issue here is _standing_. Animals, being \\"property\\" rather than rights-bearers, don't have \\"standing\\" to bring lawsuits, and generally human beings don't have \\"standing\\" to bring suits on animals' behalf. Christopher Stone suggested in a 1972 paper (\\"Do Trees Have Standing?\\") that even such natural objects as trees should have standing so that they can be represented in court by human organizations that want to protect them. But so far there hasn't been a majority on the U.S. Supreme Court that has agreed (and in fact Stone himself has since backed off from his suggestion).<br /><br />Francione does a nice job on this issue. For my money, this reform is the _single_ most important one on the animal-law list; it alone would revolutionize the movement toward humane treatment of animals (and trees, for that matter).<br /><br />Now, there are several nits to be picked in the philosophical foundations on which Francione builds. This isn't really the place to pick them since Francione is explicitly refraining from mounting a full philosophical case for these foundations. But I'll mention three of them because they also affect the success of Regan's arguments.<br /><br />(1) Francione argues that utilitarian, \\"welfarist\\" ethics can't protect animal welfare because that welfare can always be overruled by consequentialist considerations. But his own case (and Regan's) takes the view that rights are themselves only _prima facie_ moral claims, and therefore still subject to overruling. It is unclear where Francione (and Regan) would draw the line about having them overruled, but it does seem as though many (most? all?) of those \\"consequentialist\\" considerations coud be rephrased, brought in the back door as deontological considerations, and weighed against animal rights all over again under the new ethical regime. (And besides, both Francione and Regan admit that rights may be overruled by _some_ consequentialist considerations.) So it's not clear that rights really _would_ provide a greater degree of protection to animal welfare -- especially since, as Francione's own examples show, part of theproblem is just that even the _current_ regulations against harm to animals aren't strictly enforced. Is the problem utilitarianism in general and in principle, or just that the current version of legal-welfarist utilitarianism doesn't take adequate account of animal interests?<br /><br />(2) Francione (following Regan) bases the possession of rights on intrinsic worth. But it isn't just obvious, and neither one of them actually _argues_, that nonhuman animals have the _same_ intrinsic worth as human beings. Nor, for that matter, is it obvious that intrinsic worth really _is_ a sufficient ground for rights; surely there might be creatures whose existence was intrinsically worthwhile but whose survival requirements conflicted so far with our own that they couldn't be said to have any \\"rights\\" with respect to human beings. And in that case, it's not clear why, or even whether, the intrinsic worth of other species gives rise to moral claims that are binding specifically on _us_.<br /><br />(3) Isn't it also possible that animal welfare lives in a sort of moral \\"no-man's land\\" in which there really _aren't_ any moral claims sufficiently well-defined to be called \\"rights\\"? Maybe, e.g., animals don't have a full moral claim against us not to mistreat them, but human beings who mistreat animals also don't have a moral claim against other humans not to interfere forcibly with such mistreatment. If something like this is even conceivable, it's not clear that consequentialism and deontologism really exhaust the alternatives.<br /><br />Ah, well -- if one book could answer all our questions, it would be a very different world. At any rate Francione's book is a most worthy successor to Tom Regan's groundbreaking philosophical work and it deserves to be read by anyone interested in the humane treatment of nonhuman animals. Heck, if the opening description of the annual \\"pigeon shoot\\" in Hegins PA doesn't cause a wrenching in your gut (no matter what you think of \\"animal rights\\"), then you and I don't inhabit the same moral universe.m to animals aren't strictly enforced. Is the problem utilitarianism in general and in principle, or just that the current version of legal-welfarist utilitarianism doesn't take adequate account of animal interests?    (2) Francione (following Regan) bases the possession of rights on intrinsic worth. But it isn't just obvious, and neither one of them actually _argues_, that nonhuman animals have the _same_ intrinsic worth as human beings. Nor, for that matter, is it obvious that intrinsic worth really _is_ a sufficient ground for rights; surely there might be creatures whose existence was intrinsically worthwhile but whose survival requirements conflicted so far with our own that they couldn't be said to have any \\"rights\\" with respect to human beings. And in that case, it's not clear why, or even whether, the intrinsic worth of other species gives rise to moral claims that are binding specifically on _us_.    (3) Isn't it also possible that animal welfare lives in a sort of moral \\"no-man's land\\" in which there really _aren't_ any moral claims sufficiently well-defined to be called \\"rights\\"? Maybe, e.g., animals don't have a full moral claim against us not to mistreat them, but human beings who mistreat animals also don't have a moral claim against other humans not to interfere forcibly with such mistreatment. If something like this is even conceivable, it's not clear that consequentialism and deontologism really exhaust the alternatives.    Ah, well -- if one book could answer all our questions, it would be a very different world. At any rate Francione's book is a most worthy successor to Tom Regan's groundbreaking philosophical work and it deserves to be read by anyone interested in the humane treatment of nonhuman animals. Heck, if the opening description of the annual \\"pigeon shoot\\" in Hegins PA doesn't cause a wrenching in your gut (no matter what you think of \\"animal rights\\"), then you and I don't inhabit the same moral universe.	2003-02-06

This is a reposting of my review of the second edition.]<br />There are two books I recommend as introductions to libertarian thought. One of them is Murray Rothbard's _For A New Liberty_. This is the other.<br />Dr. Mary Ruwart's _Healing Our World_ is in some ways a better general introduction suitable for a broader audience, in large measure because it appeals to the better nature of everybody from conservative Christians to hippie mystics: she really _does_ mean, and quite rightly, that libertarian principles are the means for healing our world. Her essential point is that, _whatever_ our goals and beliefs, we can best serve them by honoring our neighbors' choices so long as they aren't threatening our lives or property. For when we do so, everybody wins; my gains aren't your losses, and there really is a common good at which we can both aim.<br />Moreover, Ruwart carefully and compassionately explains why the libertarian approach is a better way to bring about the (entirely legitimate) goals of the more modern sort of liberal: for example, improving the quality and availability of medical care (including alternative medicines), reducing pollution, saving the environment, and so forth. Readers of, say, the Objectivist/Randian literature might come away with the impression that concern for the well-being of persons other than oneself (let alone the \\"environment\\"!) is just incompatible with libertarianism. Ruwart argues that in fact libertarianism offers not only the best way to _promote_ such concern but the only viable way to put it into practice. (On this ground alone, there are probably lots of _libertarians_ who could profit from a close reading of Ruwart's book just to pick up its tone and tenor. Her example of tolerant understanding could lead more \\"brittle\\" thinkers to enter empathically into values that haven't exactly been common among libertarians.)<br />Lurking in the background of Ruwart's exposition is her clear sense of the \\"market\\" as simply voluntary human interaction within a framework of obligatory respect for others' well-being. This view should appeal even to readers who don't care for the term \\"market\\"; it might, for example, be attractive to various sorts of communitarian and others who worry about the reduction of social life to economic exchange. The essential point is that human society, community, is an organic network of interacting centers of voluntary activity, not a bureaucratic order that imposes mechanical top-down rules via statute or regulatory agency -- and that trying to turn it from the former into the latter is just a fancy way to destroy it.<br />Ruwart's outlook should delight everybody from Calvinists to Hayekians to Taoists. And there has never been a time at which it's been more important to get the word out on liberty. Get this book at once and pass out copies to your friends; Ruwart's libertarianism has something to say to people of every political and/or religious persuasion or none.<br />By the way, you can pre-read it online if you know where to look...wart's exposition is her clear sense of the \\"market\\" as simply voluntary human interaction within a framework of obligatory respect for others' well-being.

And too often, \\"leftist\\" critiques of capitalism fall into the latter category, crying \\"market failure\\" and calling for central control by government regulation.<br />This book is the _other_ sort. And it represents the fulfillment of a long line of \\"hippie spirituality\\" that began over thirty years ago, got some airtime in Stephen Gaskin's books and Paul Williams's _Das Energi_, was put into practice at a broad level by the Grateful Dead, was incorporated into Marilyn Ferguson's _Aquarian Conspiracy_, received a consistently libertarian exposition in Mary Ruwart's _Healing our World_, and -- if Paul Hawkens and the Lovinses are right -- looks to be the wave of the future if we're going to have a future at all. (Incidentally, Gaskin recommended this book when he ran for President in 2000.)<br />One tremendous strength of their approach is their avoidance of a very common error. Too many critics of eco-stupidity and corporate irresponsibility take themselves to be critics of the \\"free market\\" as such, failing to realize that their proposed solutions are, in an economic sense, just as \\"capitalistic\\" as (if not more so than) the problems. What they propose to replace \\"capitalism\\" by is, in fact, just capitalism again, but populated by people with better values.<br />Well, these folks know that's exactly what they're doing, and what they propose is in effect the best general response to cries of \\"market failure\\". In a strictly economic sense, every \\"market failure\\" really represents a place that the \\"market\\" hasn't reached yet. Under the Hawken/Lovins proposal, \\"markets\\" work just fine if they take account of _all_ relevant costs. Economically, what they're saying is that (e.g.) polluters have to _internalize_ the costs of pollution. Is there a libertarian out there who would disagree in principle?<br />Oh, we could pick nits about the details. The point, though, is that Hawkens and the Lovinses are presenting here a vision of the \\"free market\\" as what economists have always said it was: an organic, emergent, genuinely interdependent network of centers of genuinely voluntary activity by fully informed and self-responsible actors. And the resulting society looks like hippies have always said it should: less like the military-industrial complex and more like a Grateful Dead concert ;-).<br />If Aquarian libertarianism is (as Mary Ruwart says) the key to \\"healing our world\\", then the sort of green eco-capitalism represented here is a pretty sound prescription for that healing. The Dream isn't dead, and it isn't economically irresponsible either.The point, though, is that Hawkens and the Lovinses are presenting here a vision of the \\"free market\\" as what economists have always said it was: an organic, emergent, genuinely interdependent network of centers of genuinely voluntary activity by fully informed and self-responsible actors.

I've been a libertarian for as long as I've been anything; as far as I'm concerned, we'd all be better off without the governmental institutions of the territorial nation-state. (Oh, we need courts and stuff, but I'm not persuaded that these work any better with territorial nation-states than without them.)<br /><br />But as long as territorial nation-states do exist, it would be nice to have folks at the helm who would work to undo, or at least counterbalance, all the mischief these Leviathans cause. It's a simple matter of economic fact that the poor are poorer than they would be without government intervention in the economy. If the folks at the economic margins are, for example, receiving less medical care than they'd have received in a genuinely free society, then isn't there a case to be made that the government that caused this problem has some responsibility for correcting it?<br /><br />And even for hard-core libertarians, there's an argument in favor of some forms of antitrust law -- namely, that powerful megacorporations exist in the first place only because they enjoy various sorts of protection from the state, and therefore the state has some sort of responsibility to keep them in check. Sure, it would be better to end protectionism and \\"crony capitalism\\" altogether. But if that doesn't happen, an admittedly distant second best is for the State to regulate the monsters it has created. It may not be ideal by libertarian standards, but it sure beats having legislators and judges in the corporations' pockets.<br /><br />All of this is by way of explaining why I, a libertarian whose politics are in some respects at least superficially at odds with Stephen Gaskin's, am writing a highly favorable review of this book.<br /><br />See, Stephen ran for president in 2000, and this book is a collection of excerpts from writings and interviews that describe his platform. More generally, it's about what it might be like to have a hippie in the White House. And some readers will dismiss it as (what they think is) the usual hippie claptrap.<br /><br />It's no such thing. For one thing, as anyone familiar with Stephen's own history is surely aware, he's strongly in favor of self-reliance at the level of the local community. He doesn't want the feds to operate charitable, welfare-promoting institutions; he wants _us_ to do it, just as they do it on the Farm (the commune in Tennessee that Stephen helped found some thirty years ago; it's still there).<br /><br />He also has a healthy distrust of government authority, although you might not know it from his views on (e.g.) gun control. I'm against gun-control-by-law myself, not because I want to have an arsenal in my basement, but because I don't trust any government that doesn't trust an armed citizenry. I don't think Stephen is entirely consistent on this issue and I don't think making people disarm under government authority is any more peaceful or nonviolent than holding the gun on them yourself. There are other, more genuinely peaceful ways to encourage people to lay down their arms.<br /><br />But despite a few disagreements on some points with some of Stephen's specific views on what the government should ideally do, I agree completely with where his opinions are _from_, if you follow me. There are some differences in what we see, but we're looking out from the same place.<br /><br />I'd love to see the Greens and the Libertarians get closer together. And I can get behind every one of Stephen's aims as long as I'm allowed to be a little critical about exactly _how_ they're implemented.<br /><br />So if you're curious what it might be like to have a hippie in the White House, check this out. Stephen and his crew are kind folks, and given the extreme unlikelihood of my _ever_ agreeing at every point with a political candidate, I'd be more likely to vote for him on the basis of his overall vision than to vote for a real creep who happens to agree with me on a few specific points. As they say, when the wrong person does the right thing, it's the wrong thing; the corollary is obvious.c points.

In a way that's kind of sad, but hey, I don't mind going first, fellas. Besides, I've reviewed just about everything of Stephen Gaskin's I could find, and it's about time I reviewed Ina May's book.<br />And here in Ohio we've got a Mennonite midwife named Freida Miller who's doing time in prison. Why? Because she saved the life of a birthing mother by giving her prescription medication without a license. Worse, she's not even in prison for dispensing the meds; she's in prison because she refuses to reveal the name of the doctor who _gave_ her the meds in the first place. This displeases me and causes me to question the legal and pharmaceutical establishments even more than I already did, which is a lot. So consider this review my little blow for the revolution.<br />Ina May Gaskin wrote the book on midwifery -- four times, in fact, as the fourth edition of the book was published in 2002 and it gets longer every time. The new edition is updated with the usual stuff, including yet more stories from the parents and midwives at the Farm (including some stories from the babies, now all grown up, who were the subjects of the _original_ stories) and a new preface by Ina May. And if you're reading this page, you don't need me to tell you that it's the bible of practical midwifery.<br />What you may _not_ already know is what a spiritual book it is. Of course the title is _Spiritual Midwifery_, but some readers may be inclined to write that off as hippie jargon. As other reviewers have noted, there is some hippie jargon in the book, but I don't think you should read \\"around\\" it or \\"past\\" it. You should read _through_ it; it's part of the point. The medium really is sometimes the message, and this is the appropriate language for the concepts Ina May wants to lay on you.<br />What Ina May wants you to know, what she and the midwives at the Farm have successfully shown for thirty years and counting, is that birthing really is (or can be) a sacrament and that _how we be_ has a profound effect on _how we birth_. As Stephen remarks somewhere, the Farm midwives have successfully demonstrated that _vibes are real_. This is good news and it's important to more than birthing mothers -- even to more than women.<br />I don't mean to minimize the importance of the practical midwifing aspects of the book, either; it's just that I didn't read the book for that reason myself. (I was present at the births of both of my children, but they were born in the hospital as my wife preferred.)<br />The thing is, Ina May and Stephen are good people. In fact they manage to be both kind _and_ competent -- a difficult trick and one that I certainly haven't mastered myself. And there are lots of other good people represented in this book, in the stories and in the pictures. (The folks in the photos look like folks you'd want to meet. If you look at them right, you can actually see their souls.)<br />So this review is partly to help spread the word about midwifery and partly to help spread the word about these good people. Vibes _are_ real, it _does_ matter how we be, and don't let anybody tell you any different.can be) a sacrament and that _how we be_ has a profound effect on _how we birth_.

1273032:US	52474360	RS0DQ97S4LZS2	0385334303	900904156	The Naked Ape: A Zoologist's Study of the Human Animal	Books	5	38	46	N	Y	A modern classic that holds up well	I have fond memories of this book. It was first published in 1967 and I read it pretty young; I'd have to reckon it among the more powerful influences of my youth. Controversial or not, there's something profoundly liberating about stepping back and looking at humankind as one species among others.<br />And actually, it's still a darned good book. As Stephen Gaskin remarks somewhere in _This Season's People_, human beings are so intelligent and conscious that it's a matter of controversy whether we're the lowest of the angels or the highest of the primates. Well, the controversy hasn't dissipated since this book was written, but it's still every bit as important for us to recognize and accept the reality of our animal nature.<br />For we _do_ have such a nature, no matter what view of evolution and/or creation we buy into. Evolutionary anthropologist Desmond Morris tends to treat us as though we have _only_ such a nature, as though our being an advanced ape is automatically at odds with our also being a fallen angel. That may or may not be true; I have my opinions on the subject, and you probably have yours.<br />But we don't need to settle that issue in order to find this book immensely valuable. The most solid evidence we have continues to confirm that we have a close genetic kinship with the other primates and that, biologically, we are best treated as primates ourselves. Whatever else may be true of us, this much is about as close as anything in science ever comes to fully established fact.<br />We can disagree about the precise mechanisms of evolution as much as we like; we can disagree about how much of our nature is really accounted for by this or that theory of evolution; but the one fact we can't get around on _any_ account is that as a matter of biology, we _are_ naked apes. We may be more than animals, but we are not less.<br />That's what makes Morris's account so valuable. There just isn't a lot of question that our evolutionary history has shaped us to a very great degree, and Morris is awfully good at explaining how and why this is so. There may be details in need of modification -- after all, evolutionary theory hasn't stood still for the past thirty-five years and some of Morris's own theories were far from universal even then -- but the overall structure is sound.<br />It's no surprise, of course, that this book was so controversial when it was first published; I'm not sure it would be all that much less controversial if it were published for the first time today. But boy, if you want to get a clear sense of what it _means_ for human beings to be primates, this is a great place to acquire it.<br />And contrary to what your initial intuition may be, it _especially_ belongs on the reading list of folks who think human beings have a spiritual side too. Nobody ever made much spiritual advance by denying the hard facts of his or her biological nature and pretending to be a disembodied spirit.a very great degree, and Morris is awfully good at explaining how and why this is so.

Like Desmond Morris's _The Naked Ape_, this book is an old friend of mine. The second volume in his well-known trilogy (the third is _Intimate Behavior_), this one makes a compelling case that modern cities are less like \\"jungles\\" and more like zoos.<br />Other animals, Morris says, don't behave in the wild the way humans do in cities. But the sort of erratic violence and heightened self-stimulation in which we find modern humans engaging _does_ have a counterpart in the rest of the animal world: animals do act that way . . . in zoos.<br />Essentially, Morris's claim is that many millions of years of evolution have equipped us for life in small communities in which everybody knows everybody else and there's enough room for us to move around without klonking into each other all the time. We are not, in short, adapted to the modern metropolis, and that's why \\"city folk\\" are so danged weird. And our misattribution of our maladaptive behavior actually gives the jungle an undeserved bad name.<br />So what's a naked ape to do? I don't know that the intervening years since this book was first published have generated a whole lot of solutions. I guess that's, um, life in the big city.<br />But as with so many problems, just being aware of the problem is at least half the solution. As with Morris's other books (especially _The Naked Ape_), it's profoundly helpful to step back and see ourselves as one biological species among others (whether or not that's _all_ we are).<br />Okay, maybe that's not all we are; maybe the fact that we _can_ thus step back from ourselves is the single most important fact about our species. If so, that makes this book more valuable, not less.<br />So think of this book (and Morris's others) as a way to give your \\"I\\" a little distance on your \\"me,\\" if you know what I mean. And yes, that does mean that I'm recommending a couple of books on evolutionary anthropology as helpful to your spirituality.	2003-01-10

It helps some people and doesn't help others. I haven't touched it in years (and that wasn't me, and it wasn't ganja, and I was just keeping it for a friend of mine, and anyway I didn't inhale). If it helps you, go ahead and make it a sacrament as Stephen describes here, and follow his excellent advice. (And do let's drop this nonsensical \\"War on Drugs,\\" shall we?)<br />But that's not what this book is really about. What it's about is realizing that you are God -- not in the sense that your personal, local ego is the divine, omnipotent, omniscient creator of the cosmos, but in the sense that God is _being_ you, if you know what I mean.<br />If you _don't_ know what I mean, you stand a pretty good chance of picking it up from Stephen, whether you ever toke up (again) or not. As with all his writings, if you're receiving on the frequency where he's broadcasting, you'll pick up one helluva spiritual contact high.<br />Me, I find that if I go too long without reading him, I start to get cranky -- yell at the dog and kick the kids, or vice versa, or something -- but cracking open any one of his books mellows me out right away. My own receiver, at least, is definitely tuned to his channel.<br />Yours may be too. Oh, maybe not -- not every \\"spiritual teacher\\" (ugh) is suitable for everyone, and you may be better off with somebody else or with nobody at all. That's okay; Stephen isn't looking for followers (and you should beware of anyone who is, both for your sake and for theirs).<br />But it's worth the trouble of finding out. It's entirely possible that you found this page precisely because Stephen is just exactly what you're looking for.<br />It's really just a question of picking up his vibe. (And if you know what I mean by _that_, you will almost definitely find him worth reading.) It's not so much that he's going to _teach_ you anything in particular; he'll just knock your mind loose from your brain, maybe only a little at first. And then a little bit more . . .<br />Mainly you'll just grin and be happy that Stephen is possible.

I just got this yesterday	This is a nice resource for Tull fans -- most of whom probably already have it, but mine just arrived yesterday.<br />Anyway, for anyone who doesn't already know it, this volume collects all of the lyrics from Tull's and Ian Anderson's official releases from _This Was_ in 1968 to _Roots to Branches_ in 1995.<br />The first twenty or thirty pages consist of Ian Anderson himself providing a retrospective/commentary on the various releases, and on the stages of Tull's long and varied career. These are culled from a couple of talks with Anderson and they're clearly transcriptions of oral interviews, with all the limitations thereby implied. (For example, the word &quot;tempo&quot; is consistently transcribed as &quot;temper&quot;.) They're pretty informative, though, and at any rate I like the transcriptions since I enjoy listening to Anderson talk.<br />The lyrics themselves will be most useful for those albums/CDs with which the words aren't already included in the liner notes, but there are also a handful of helpful footnotes scattered throughout. (Nothing interpretive; just stuff like the actual name of the &quot;Winged Isle&quot; and the significance of &quot;Beltane,&quot; items probably already familiar to longtime Tull fans but perhaps not to the band's newer audience.)<br />There are also a dozen-odd pages of photos, some of which had never been published before this. (There's a list at the back of the book telling who's in them and when they were taken. Incidentally, one allegedly from &quot;1974&quot; -- Anderson on a motorcycle -- appears to be misdated; it looks to be from a decade later. I assume &quot;1974&quot; is a typo for &quot;1984&quot;.)<br />Some customers may also want to know that Anderson donates all his royalties from the sales of this book to a fund for the preservation of wild cats. I'm delighted to have contributed to such a cause and I'd have bought the book sooner if I'd known.	2003-01-08

I'm writing another review of it now so that it will appear on my list of reviews next to my review of the butchered 2002 screen adaptation of this epic work.<br />Alexandre Dumas's _The Count of Monte Cristo_ is one of the greatest novels of all time and in fact stands at the fountainhead of the entire stream of popular adventure-fiction. Dumas himself was one of the founders of the genre; every other such writer -- H. Rider Haggard, C.S. Forrester, Zane Grey, Louis L'Amour, Mickey Spillane, Ian Fleming, Tom Clancy, John Grisham -- is deeply in his debt.<br />The cold, brooding, vampiric Count (born Edmond Dantes; known also, among other aliases, as \\"Sinbad the Sailor,\\" Lord Wilmore, and a representative of the firm of Thomson and French) is the literary forebear of every dark hero from Sherlock Holmes and the Scarlet Pimpernel to Zorro, Batman, the Green Hornet, and Darkman. And the intricate plot provides everything any reader could want: adventure, intrigue, romance, and (of course) the elegant machinations of the Count himself as he exacts his terrible revenge on those who have wronged him -- thereby serving, or so he believes, as an agent of divine justice and retribution. Brrrrrrrr.<br />The book is also a good deal _longer_ than many readers may be aware. Ever since the middle of the nineteenth century, the English translations have omitted everything in the novel that might offend the sensibilities of Victorian readers -- including, for example, all the sex and drugs.<br />That's why I strongly recommend that anyone interested in this novel read Robin Buss's full-text translation. Unlike, say, Ayn Rand (whose cardboard hero \\"John Galt\\" also owes his few interesting aspects to Monsieur le Comte), Dumas was entirely capable of holding a reader's undivided attention for over a thousand pages; Buss's translation finally does his work justice, restoring all the bits omitted from the Bowdlerized versions.<br />The heart of the plot, as most readers will already know, is that young sailor Edmond Dantes, just as his life starts to come together, is wrongfully imprisoned for fourteen years in the dungeons of the Chateau d'If as the victim of a monstrously evil plot to frame him as a Bonapartist. While in prison he makes the acquaintance of one Abbe Faria, who serves as his mentor and teaches him the ways of the world (science, philosophy, languages and literature, and so forth), and also makes him a gift of a fabulous treasure straight out of the _Thousand and One Nights_. How Dantes gets out of prison, and what he does after that -- well, that's the story, of course. So that's all I'm going to tell you.<br />However, I'll also tell you that the 2002 screen adaptation doesn't even begin to do it justice. The plot is so far \\"adapted\\" as to be unrecognizable, except in its broad outlines and the names of (some of) the characters. Pretty much everything that makes Dumas's novel so darkly fascinating has been sucked out of it. It's not a bad movie on its own terms, but if you're expecting an adaptation of this novel, you'll be disappointed.

This book isn't it.<br /><br />But if you're interested in yoga as a form of physical exercise that will help you to inhabit your body (and this planet) comfortably and perhaps occasionally even with a modicum of grace, and you want a no-nonsense book that will show you how to do it without requiring you to do obeisance to a guru full of Profound Insights, look no further. This book _is_ it.<br /><br />The latter paragraph describes me. In traditional Hindu terms, I'm most definitely a jnana kind of guy (and a pretty iconoclastic one at that). Intellectually, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan's _An Idealist View of Life_ comes close to capturing my philosophical outlook (which in my case owes as much to Royce and Bradley as to Shankara). I can muster up some reverence when it's absolutely necessary, but in general I'm about as inclined toward bhakti as your cat.<br /><br />And I certainly don't have much patience for the sort of stuff Frank Zappa memorably described as \\"Cosmik Debris\\"; the little reverence I _do_ have, I reserve exclusively for the Absolute, not for His/Her/Its self-appointed earthly representatives.<br /><br />Nevertheless, for the reasons to which I briefly alluded above, I've been practicing yoga, at least on and off, for something over twenty years. And I like this book.<br /><br />Now, I'm not knocking gurus; if you want one, go get one. (Just please, for your own sake, check them out carefully and stick to the real ones, like Sri Ramana Maharshi. And Iyengar's books are very good if you want that sort of thing.) I'm just saying that if you're like me, this is the yoga book you want. It sets out the asanas in anatomical detail, with photos of not only the right way but also several common _wrong_ ways of doing them. The descriptions are very good and very clear. And if you don't think you can do the \\"hard\\" ones right away, don't worry; simpler variants are included.<br /><br />This is not, in short, a yoga book that will make you feel like a spiritual quitter or a fraud or something if you're just doing it for exercise. You can do as much or as little as you want, and this book will be right there to help you. (There's helpful information on diet and such too, but here again, you can take the parts you can use and leave the rest.)<br /><br />Andre van Lysebeth wasn't looking for devoted chelas when he wrote this helpful guide. It was first published in the 1970s and it's stood the test of the intervening decades. I'm delighted to find that it's back in print so that I can get a replacement copy.ry good and very clear.

He wasn't looking for converts, followers, or even agreement, and I've always felt free to disagree with the way he makes this or that point. So this book has long been perfectly suited to me and my somewhat iconoclastic/refractory temperament.<br />This little book is one of a very small handful that I regard as the absolute cream of &quot;hippie spirituality&quot;. Stephen Gaskin's _This Season's People_ is that literature's Diamond Sutra and Paul Williams's _Das Energi_ is its Tao Te Ching. Golas's slim volume comes very close to Gaskin's in its adamantine wisdom and so ranks as a close second in diamond-sutrahood, but I think of it as something like the Dhammapada.<br />Its message is so easy to put across that, technically, you already know everything it says. The heart of the matter is: relax; just love as much as you can from wherever you are. When you come right down to it, you're already &quot;enlightened&quot; and you don't have anything to prove.<br />But somehow, the _way_ Golas puts this message (and the bit about &quot;love as much as you can&quot; is a direct quotation) has some major mojo in it, enough to knock your mind loose from your brain.<br />Golas knew it, too. He died in 1997, but a couple of years before that, he wrote a nice long introduction to this book so that it could be republished in hardcover. It was, and this is that edition. There are also some photos of Golas, ranging from childhood to middle age. (That's good for potential buyers to know, because the full text of the original book is available online and there wouldn't be much point in getting this one if it didn't contain anything new.)<br />In the introduction, Golas provides some interesting autobiography and also expresses more than a little wonderment at the effect this little book has had. He even notes that there are some things in it that he's even come to believe are incorrect, and yet he won't change a word of it because it seems to have the power to _do_ something to its readers, something compared to which his &quot;corrected&quot; views seem flat and tame. This is quite true. So beware; in its way this text is every bit as potent as all of Anthony de Mello's books.<br />A longtime &quot;underground&quot; spiritual classic, this little book belongs on your shelf next to Douglas Harding's _On Having No Head_ (which takes a very different but every bit as &quot;simple&quot; approach to the non-problem of enlightenment).ect, and yet he won't change a word of it because it seems to have the power to _do_ something to its readers, something compared to which his &quot;corrected&quot; views seem flat and tame.

If you've read his _Labyrinths of Reason_ or _The Recursive Universe_, you already know he's a terrific expositor of the logical and mathematical brain-benders that have driven both mathematics and philosophy for the past century or so. Well, this book really gives him a chance to shine.<br />You see, it's one big story that consists of several sub-stories. In part it's a biography (intellectual and otherwise) of John von Neumann, one of the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century. It's also a popular exposition of game theory and some of the decision-theoretic puzzles that arise in it (most obviously the one of the book's title). And it's _also_ a history of the Cold War, at least on its strategic side.<br />You pretty much have to be William Poundstone to weave all this together into a coherent and readable narrative. Fortunately, William Poundstone _is_ William Poundstone, and he pulls it off with panache.<br />There's something here for everybody. My favorite parts are the chapters on the various game-theoretic dilemmas (including a _very_ nice exposition of Robert Axelrod's _The Evolution of Cooperation_ that correctly captures what Axelrod did and did not show in his famous computer tournaments). But the biography of von Neumann is fascinating too; great mathematicians tend to be odd and interesting characters, and von Neumann was one of the greatest. And all the Cold War-era history is riveting in its own right, even apart from its relationship to von Neumann (who may have been at least one of the real-life models for Dr. Strangelove).<br />Poundstone is a fine writer with a real gift for this sort of thing. If even one of the strands in this tale sounds engaging to you, you can rest assured that Poundstone will manage to keep you engaged in the other two as well.<br />Look for his other books too. I especially recommend _Labyrinths of Reason_.	2002-12-28

God, infinity, Kabbalah -- how could you _miss_?<br />It was okay, I guess.<br />So what happened? Well, frankly, although the biographical information on Georg Cantor and Kurt Goedel is pretty good and the mathematical history is reliable, there's no real meat in the discussions of either infinity or the Kabbalah. Every time I thought Aczel was really going to get rolling and make a profound connection, he sort of petered out and changed the subject.<br />It's too bad, because Aczel really does have an important point lurking in here: the mathematics of infinity really does provide a window into the Ein Sof, and there probably is a connection (both historical and deeper) between the Kabbalistic and the Cantorian uses of the Hebrew letter alef. I'd have enjoyed some more thorough exposition, even at an elementary level, of both sides of this equation.<br />But for that, the reader will have to look (for infinity) to Rudy Rucker's _Infinity and the Mind_ or (slightly more elementary) Eli Maor's _To Infinity and Beyond_, or (for the rest) to any of numerous sources on Kabbalah. This book is only about a quarter-inch deep.<br />On the plus side, though, I will say that this isn't a bad book for somebody who has never encountered the subject(s) before. Just don't expect a lot of specificity; Aczel usually doesn't offer much more than vague allusions.	2002-12-28

I read this one twenty years ago and never quite got over it. Georg Cantor sure opened a can of worms with all that infinity stuff.<br />John Horton Conway is probably best known as the creator/discoverer of the computer game called \\"Life,\\" with which he re-founded the entire field of cellular automata. What he does in this book is the _other_ thing he's best known for: he shows how to construct the \\"surreal numbers\\" (they were actually named by Donald Knuth).<br />Conway's method employs something like Dedekind cuts (the objects Richard Dedekind used to construct the real numbers from the rationals), but more general and much more powerful. Conway starts with the empty set and proceeds to construct the entire system of surreals, conjuring them forth from the void using a handful of recursive rules.<br />The idea is that we imagine numbers created on successive \\"days\\". On the first day, there's 0; on the next, -1 and +1; on the next, 2, 1/2, -1/2, and -2; on the next, 3, 3/4, 1/4, -1/4, -3/4, and -3; and so on. In the first countably-infinite round, we get all the numbers that can be written as a fraction whose denominator is a power of two (including, obviously, all the whole numbers). We can get as close to any other real number as we like, but they haven't actually been created yet at this point.<br />But we're just getting started. Once we get out past the first infinity, things really get weird. By the time we're through, which technically is \\"never,\\" Conway's method has generated not only all the real numbers but way, way, way more besides (including more infinities than you've ever dreamed of). His system is so powerful that it includes the \\"hyperreal\\" numbers (infinitesimals and such) that emerge (by a very different route, of course) from Abraham Robinson's nonstandard analysis as a trivial special case.<br />So there's a lot here to get your mind around, and it's a lot of fun for readers who like to watch numbers being created out of nothing. But wait -- there's more.<br />See, the _full_ title of the book includes not only \\"numbers\\" but also \\"games\\". And that's the rest of the story. Conway noticed that in the board game of Go, there were certain patterns in the endgames such that each \\"game\\" looked like it could be constructed out of smaller \\"games\\". It turns out that something similar is true of all games that have certain properties, and that his surreal numbers tie into such games very nicely; \\"numbers\\" (and their generalizations) represent strategies in those games. So in the remainder of the book Conway spells this stuff out and revolutionizes the subject of game theory while he's at it.<br />Well, there must be maybe two or three people in the world to whom this all sounds very cool and yet who haven't already heard of this book.

But at some point in his life he must have come to some sort of deep mystical realization.<br />Otherwise he couldn't have written this book, which reads like a Western version of Shankara. This is philosophy in the grand old style, and it's one of the high points of British idealism.<br />Bradley's argument doesn't always hold up in its precise details. He doesn't, for example, think that \\"relations\\" are real because (he says) they lead to an infinite regress. But Royce replied to this pretty adequately in an appendix to _The World and the Individual_. He also states firmly (and I think correctly) that there's no conceiving reality apart from experience and there's no duality in experience between subject and object. But support for this claim isn't exactly forthcoming. (Timothy L.S. Sprigge does a much better job with it in _The Vindication of Absolute Idealism_.)<br />But the essential structure of his argument is sound and could be carried through again with a different set of examples (the standard logical paradoxes, say): the world of our ordinary experience turns out upon inspection to be contradictory, so it can't be fully and finally real; what _is_ fully and finally real is a nondual Absolute in which all those apparent contradictions are resolved through that very nonduality.<br />Well, Bradley puts it better than that, of course, and his prose style is very pleasant to read. This work is also excerpted in James W. Allard and Guy Stock's collection of Bradley's _Writings on Logic and Metaphysics_, so if you want to read a shorter version, check that volume out.<br />Anyway, the point is, don't ever let anybody tell you there isn't any nondualistic wisdom here in the West. In a different time and place, Bradley would have been revered as a guru -- a prospect that in all likelihood would have made him cringe, so it's probably just as well. But he's clearly trying to articulate a vision here, and few writers have tackled \\"rational mysticism\\" with such philosophical flair.<br />I doubt that Shankara would have shot cats.

I hope it gets republished.<br />For one thing, it's funny. Karl Sigmund is a mathematician, and he has a mathematician's sense of humor. (I mean that as a _good_ thing.)<br />For another, it's very informative. The topics of the chapters are widely scattered -- John Horton Conway's game of Life; predator-prey systems; the Prisoner's Dilemma and the evolution of cooperation -- but what they have in common is their relevance to evolutionary biology, ecology, and psychology. And I don't personally know of any other single volume that introduces _all_ of them to the lay reader -- let alone that does so as well and charmingly as Sigmund's book.<br />I originally set out to review it because I had just written a review of William Provine's _The Origins of Theoretical Population Genetics_. These two books work pretty well together: Provine gives a &quot;diachronic&quot; account of the historical development of the field (or at least one of its major subfields), and Sigmund gives a &quot;synchronic&quot; account of its present state (or nearly so; the book was written in 1993). Between the two of them, they ought to give the interested reader a pretty healthy sense of what's so intellectually captivating about this field.<br />Well, if that sounds good to you, pick up a used copy of Sigmund's book. Or maybe, by the time you read this, it will be back in print.	2002-12-17

There has never, so far as I know, been any real argument over whether such evolution occurs. The fuss, certainly ever since 1859, has always been mainly about two things: _how_ it occurs (Does it happen solely by 'natural selection'? If so, by what mechanism(s)? Or does it happen at least partly by design?), and whether it's sufficient to provide a complete account of speciation (and sometimes the origin of life, though strictly speaking this point is not part of the theory of evolution itself).<br /><br />Not that you'd know this from most public debate on the subject. If there's one topic guaranteed to generate letters to the editor written at a grade-school level or below from people who ought to know better (on _both_ sides), this is surely it.<br /><br />Well, if everything you (think you) know about this debate comes from listening to somebody denounce it from the pulpit -- or for that matter from watching 'Inherit the Wind' and/or reading _The Selfish Gene_ -- then you really should educate yourself before sounding off about it. And one thing you'll want to learn is a little of the history of the subject.<br /><br />William Provine's scholarly history of the science of population genetics, originally written in 1971, is a fine place to start. It covers the development of the field from the time of Darwin through the early twentieth century, the period during which the synthesis of Darwinian natural selection and Mendelian genetics was taking place.<br /><br />You'll encounter some familiar names -- of course Darwin and Mendel, but also e.g. Thomas Henry Huxley, Sir Francis Galton, and J.B.S. Haldane. You'll also encounter a number of other names that probably won't be familiar to you unless you already know something about this field (or perhaps about statistics): William Bateson, Karl Pearson, Sir Ronald A. Fisher, and Sewall Wright, for example.<br /><br />And mainly, you'll get a grasp of the way Darwin's theory and the new science of genetics dovetailed and reinforced one another in the synthesis of modern population genetics. If you don't believe in evolutiuon-by-natural-selection yourself, you'll at least begin to see why other people do and what's so intellectually attractive about it. And if you _do_ believe in it yourself, you'll get a healthy sense of the fact that it hasn't ever been a uniform, monolithic theory that left no room for any sort of argument.<br /><br />It would be nice if everybody who felt entitled to an opinion in the evolution debate would read this book. Of course there are also lots of readers who don't need this warning; to them I simply say that this is a readable, well-researched history of its title topic.arwin's theory and the new science of genetics dovetailed and reinforced one another in the synthesis of modern population genetics.

Douglas Harding is dead serious (though far from solemn): he wants to show you that you have no head.<br /><br />You see, he noticed one day while wandering in the Himalayas -- where this sort of thing is apt to happen -- that _he_ didn't have a head. And, in reflecting on the experience afterwards, he worked out a way to bring other people to the same awareness with no need for either abstruse scholarly apparatus or esoteric meditation techniques.<br /><br />All you have to do is turn around the arrow of attention, and try to look back to see who -- or Who -- is looking _out_ from wherever it is you're looking out from. Go ahead. Try it right now.<br /><br />See?<br /><br />Well, if you did, you don't technically need the book any more. But Harding is still a lot of fun to read: he has a light touch, a subtle sense of humor, and the ability to compress the keenest of insights into the simplest of prose, so you'll enjoy him even if you've already gotten his point.<br /><br />And if you _haven't_ gotten it yet, he'll help you to do so. It's really the same point Alan Watts wanted to put across in _The Book: On The Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are_ (which, for my money, is his best work on the subject). Watts wants you to see that the world is your body; Harding wants you to see that the world is your mind; and they're both right.<br /><br />This is just a charming book all around, and it will grow on you over the years without ever getting old. Buy a copy and keep it; when it wears out, buy another. Pass it out to your friends. Force it on your enemies (and thereby turn them into your friends). I've gone through at least a couple copies of it myself.<br /><br />Of course, if you're one of those people who thinks spirituality isn't _supposed_ to be fun, and that anything this simple is somehow unworthy of God, you should probably stay away from it for a while. Read Raymond Smullyan's _The Tao Is Silent_ first and (chuckle) lighten up.<br /><br />Is the world you experience \\"inside\\" your mind or \\"outside\\" it?

What it traces is the development of the ideal of self-governance (the \\"autonomy\\" of the title).<br />And wow, is it good. It's well-written, it's scholarly without being inaccessible, and it treats the thought of every major ethical theorist (and some minor ones) of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.<br />It's divided into four blocks. The first treats the subject of natural law, which was in philosophical fashion at the time our story opens. The second covers the \\"perfectionist\\" ethics that followed the movement away from natural law. The third treats philosophers who began to sever ethics from theology altogether and develop a \\"naturalized\\" morality. The fourth covers the last steps up to the philosophy of Kant, including his immediate forebears and the development of Kant's own concept of \\"autonomy\\".<br />The five-hundred-odd-page text never bogs down, either. Schneewind is a crisp and clear writer who keeps things both interesting and moving. (I especially like his half-chapter on Spinoza.)<br />This is somewhere between history of philosophy and philosophy of history. On the one hand, Schneewind is just reporting the historical development of ethical philosophy; on the other hand, he's also describing the philosophical arc from natural law to Kant in a way that sheds Kant's light backward onto two centuries' worth of his predecessors.<br />If you're interested in ethics and its history, you'll want to read this. It's hard to understand where we are and where we're going without knowing where we've been.	2002-12-15

Another one in its class is William Sweet's _Idealism and Rights_, which is also excellent but specifically devoted to Bosanquet.<br />The two of them more or less take turns -- Vincent writing on Green, Bradley, and Bosanquet, and Boucher writing on Ritchie, Collingwood, and Oakeshott, and the two working together on Jones (on whom they've cowritten an earlier book). Each is a respected scholar in this field; each is a reliable guide and expositor.<br />This focus on political theory strikes me as a good idea. For one thing, it gives the reader new to idealism a way to get a handle on these philosophers. For another, it makes clear that the British idealists really _did_ have social issues in mind and _weren't_ just philosophizing in a vacuum. For a third thing, the range of political opinions represented here makes clear that metaphysical idealism doesn't, in and of itself, commit anyone to any particular political theory or outlook (a lesson that needs to be learned by some present-day libertarians who think Hegelian metaphysics is a recipe for totalitarianism).<br />These two gentlemen write clearly and well. Oh, they misspell the last name of my favorite philosopher Brand Blanshard -- as &quot;Blanchard&quot; -- but that's not as unusual as it probably should be, and I forgive them. At any rate, the exposition is sound and thorough, and each of their subjects is placed in his proper historical and philosophical context; Bradley, for example, is discussed largely in relation to Henry Sidgwick. And they are not, let's say, subjected to any undue reverence; we meet them warts and all.<br />It's well done. I recommend it to any reader who wants to learn more about idealist philosophy in general and British idealism in particular.y undue reverence; we meet them warts and all.<br />It's well done.

I can't imagine a more thorough overview of the study of human judgment, decisionmaking, and rationality.<br />It's hard to find a good single volume in this field. For the psychology of judgment and decisionmaking, there's Scott Plous's excellent book of that title. For the heuristics on which we seem to rely and the biases they seem to generate, there's the modern classic _Judgment Under Uncertainty_ by (the late) Amos Tversky and (recent Nobel prize winner) Daniel Kahneman. And there are other books devoted to special topics and subtopics.<br />But so far as I know, this is the only broad, general introduction to the entire field of thinking, how we do it, how we probably ought to do it, and the sorts of things we do it about.<br />The book is divided into three broad sections. \\"Thinking In General\\" covers just that: what thinking is, and the nature of rationality and logic. \\"Probability and Belief\\" introduces not only probability theory  (including, importantly, Bayes's Theorem) but the various theories about what probability _is_, as well as hypothesis testing, correlation, and \\"actively open-minded thinking.\\" The largest section, \\"Decisions and Plans,\\" is eleven chapters long and covers everything else: uncertainty, utility, decision analysis, theories of morality fairness, and justice, and risk.<br />As you might imagine, Baron doesn't leave too many stones unturned. Heck, his bibliography alone is thirty-odd pages long.<br />The book is eminently readable. The third edition is aimed mainly at graduate students but I gather Baron still uses it in his undergraduate courses. If you're a lay reader interested in this field, you'll be able to read it on your own with no difficulty.	2002-12-15

If you want a general introduction to Spinoza, I recommend starting with Roger Scruton or (second choice) Diane Steinberg. But if you're going to try to read the _Ethics_, you can't ask for a better companion than Lloyd.<br />It's wonderful to see how much she gets right. For example, in just a few short paragraphs, she not only adopts Martial Gueroult's suggestion to regard Spinoza as a panentheist (correctly, in my opinion), but _also_ explains the main hazard of this view (that we may forget Spinoza's God is fully expressed in each of his attributes). It's nice to see such excellent philosophical sense compressed into two pages of text.<br />She also takes Jonathan Bennett to task, quite rightly, for his reading in _A Study of Spinoza's Ethics_. I really like Bennett's commentary and I think every philosopher deserves a critic of his caliber. But he reads Spinoza, indeed expressly sets out to read Spinoza, only to find out what he has to say that is of interest to the modern academic philosopher, and he thereby winds up missing the point a lot. Lloyd sets him straight on several issues -- not least his failure to appreciate that Spinoza's development of collaborative ethics from self-regard depends on a new understanding of the self.<br />She's pretty good on the subject of the mind's eternality, too. I won't try to summarize her claims on this overworked subject; let's just say that she provides a fairly sound reply to Bennett's claim that the second half of Book Five doesn't have anything important to say to us.<br />There are several other good commentaries on the _Ethics_, of which I personally recommend Curley's _Behind the Geometrical Method_ and Bennett's aforementioned _A Study of Spinoza's Ethics_. (Among older ones, I still like Joachim's best.) But if you want a commentary suitable for both introductory and advanced readers that does a nice job of letting Spinoza speak for himself, Lloyd's is it.g Spinoza speak for himself, Lloyd's is it.	2002-12-13

William Ritchie Sorley first published it in 1918 and revised it in 1921 and 1924; since I have an old hardback copy of the third edition, I don't know if there were any later ones.<br />Anyway, what a case it presents! This was back before metaphysical idealism had fallen entirely out of philosophical fashion. And it's an excellent example of what idealism can do when it's taken seriously.<br />Essentially, Sorley sets out to offer an argument that the ultimate ground of reality is the unitary Mind of God, and the way he gets there is to argue dialectically between the natural and the moral order. His initial question is: can we infer anything about what _is_ from our apparent knowledge of what _should be_? His answer, in the end, is Yes. (If you think Hume didn't like deriving an \\"ought\\" from an \\"is,\\" imagine the conniptions he'd have had watching Sorley derive an \\"is\\" from an \\"ought\\"!)<br />There's no way to present an adequate summary of a dialectical argument that takes place over the course of twenty meaty chapters and touches on subjects from the nature of the self to the inadequacy of monism to the meaning of freedom. Just see whether you can find a copy of it if it sounds like the sort of thing you'd like.<br />It's most definitely the sort of thing _I_ like. I'm a metaphysical idealist myself and I think very highly of Timothy L.S. Sprigge's work; I also get along okay with the British idealists but tend to be closer to Royce. The sort of philosophy represented in this volume is rare these days, and Sorley is my idea of a real treat.	2002-12-13

He's very good at presenting mind-blowingly cool ideas in accessible expository prose, and he knows _just_ when to throw in the bombs.<br />This particular book is published by Dover, and it's not one of their usual reprints; it was _originally_ published by Dover. (In 1977, but the geometry of spacetime hasn't changed much since then.) It's an exploration of just what the title says: the geometry of the four-dimensional spacetime that the theory of relativity says is Really Out There.<br />Well, this is a good book on the subject, but you can get others (although one of the best -- Cornelius Lanczos's delightful _Space Through the Ages_ -- has long been out of print). What's coolest about this one is that Rudy Rucker wrote it.<br />Which means you get those little bombs thrown in at all the right places. Of course Rucker gives you what any competent mathematician will give you -- a sound introductory presentation of the mathematics of 4D spacetime and relativity theory, which are weird enough if you haven't encountered them before (and maybe even if you have) -- but he doesn't stop there. You also get an argument that the apparent passage of time is an illusion, and a little speculation about how this might tie in with the Many-Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics. And even that isn't all: you get a suggestion that it's possible to _develop a spacetime consciousness_ via some sort of meditation techniques or mystical insight, together with an entry in the annotated bibliography referring you (cautiously) to Robert A. Monroe's _Journeys Out of the Body_, whose experiments Rucker himself has tried.<br />It's like Raymond Smullyan on acid, if you know what I mean. But honest, it really does make sense. And it really will knock your mind loose from your brain even without the use of chemical aids.<br />This is the sort of thing Rucker does best. He does it in _Infinity and the Mind_, too (with which this volume has a little bit of overlap, but you won't care). Check out that book as well, along with _White Light_.

For one thing, I hate having to flip to the back of the book to read the blinkin' things. For another, it just seems as though, if you have something important to say, you ought to be able to work it into your text.<br />But Edwin Curley's _Behind the Geomtrical Method_ is an exception. He's got his main text, and he's got his notes, and the notes are thirty pages long and filled with the sort of stuff you'd expect thirty pages of notes to be filled with. But he has excellent reasons for dividing his text as he does, and it actually works pretty well.<br />You see, what he wants to do on the one hand is provide a fairly accessible introduction to Spinoza's _Ethics_. That's not easy to do if you have to burden your text (and your reader) with lots and lots of technical philosophical argumentation. Plus he's developed his views a bit since 1969 (when he published _Spinoza's Metaphysics_) and he wants to update his own outlook.<br />But he needs _somewhere_ to put the technical argumentation, because his _other_ purpose is to disagree with practically every word Jonathan Bennett has written on this subject. Bennett is the author of the absolutely brilliant _A Study of Spinoza's Ethics_, a book of the very finest caliber that subjects Spinoza to the sort of close reading every philosopher should receive at least once. But there are problems with his account, and Curley (who also thinks highly of Bennett) wants to correct them.<br />Well, for the purposes of this review, we'll leave the two Spinoza scholars to their disagreement (which has essentially to do with how Spinoza thought modes were related to substances). But the reader who wants to see a philosophical debate conducted with panache and chivalry (not to mention wit) will enjoy following up on this exchange. (See _The Cambridge Companion to Spinoza_, edited by Don Garrett, for some more of it; further references are in its bibliography. And don't miss Richard Mason's _The God of Spinoza_ for a third point of view.)<br />At bottom what Curley wants to do is something Harry Austryn Wolfson attempted with not altogether satisfactory results, and Bennett doesn't even pretend to try: locate Spinoza in philosophical history, and make sense of his philosophy by understanding in context who and what he was responding to. (What two names belong on the shortlist? If you guessed Descartes and Hobbes, give yourself an A.) He does a nice job of this even though I have to disagree with some of his own interpretations of Spinoza. (He reads Spinoza as a naturalistic materialist.)<br />It's a nice commentary, and it's a good companion for a trek through the _Ethics_.

Sometimes it ends there, too.<br />Good paradoxes aren't just for entertainment (although they _are_ vastly entertaining; check out any of Raymond Smullyan's books for proof of that assertion). Each of them opens a door to all sorts of fascinating issues of tremendous philosophical importance.<br />Mark Sainsbury's fine introduction, in its heavily revised second edition, is a set of keys to those doors. For example, his discussion of Zeno's famous paradoxes doesn't just inform the lay reader what they are; it explains why they're important even today: because they call into question whether the now-standard mathematical analyses of the paradoxes adequately capture our ordinary understanding of space. That is, the paradoxes can be resolved in the ideal space of mathematicians, but that doesn't _necessarily_ mean they can be resolved in the space in which we really live.<br />In difficulty, the exposition is about one notch higher than in William Poundstone's _Labyrinths of Reason_, so you may want to read Poundstone first if you're new to this subject altogether. But do get around to this one. It's a solid account, from a more or less \\"analytic\\" outlook (though that term probably suffers from all the \\"vagueness\\" problems discussed in Sainsbury's second chapter).<br />Sainsbury will also introduce some topics Poundstone doesn't cover -- notably, and perhaps most interestingly, Graham Priest's \\"dialethism\\" -- a logic in which, Priest claims, it's possible for some contradictions to be true[!]. Sainsbury doesn't agree but nevertheless concludes that he doesn't have a knockdown argument against it. (Be aware that Sainsbury's account has been criticized by other philosophers, including Priest. Follow up with Priest's own books if you get interested in this subject.)<br />Sainsbury also doesn't hesitate to offer his own resolutions of the paradoxes, but he warns the reader not to accept his resolutions blindly. In fact there are several about which I continue to disagree with him (not an unusual phenomenon when the subject is paradoxes), but he's changed my mind on a couple.<br />Overall, then, this is a well-written and cogently argued presentation, highly recommended to anyone interested in paradoxes and their relevance to philosophy.out which I continue to disagree with him (not an unusual phenomenon when the subject is paradoxes), but he's changed my mind on a couple.<br />Overall, then, this is a well-written and cogently argued presentation, highly recommended to anyone interested in paradoxes and their relevance to philosophy.	2002-12-12

And the fact that the book is still in print is a very good sign.<br />H.W.B. Joseph was one of Oxford's leading philosophical lights in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This book, originally published in 1906 and republished in a revised second edition in 1916, is a classic exposition of the entire subject of logic. It's got everything you look for in a philosophy text: clarity and accuracy of exposition, breadth of scope, and a keen sense of the philosophical importance of every topic under discussion. I've had a battered copy of the second edition for many years now and I still refer to it fairly often.<br />The range of subjects will probably seem remarkable to the modern reader, who expects logic to have something to do with mathematics and set theory. There's not a truth table in sight; in fact, there's no discussion of formal, propositional logic at all. Instead there's discussion of e.g. the existence and nature of universals, the principles of the syllogism, the nature of the propositional judgment, the nature of causation (and whether it's reciprocating -- i.e., whether effects determine their causes too), the meaning of \\"explanation,\\" and the nature of reasoning in mathematics and science.<br />Joseph's logic is a branch, not of mathematics, but of metaphysics. And one thing the reader will notice right away is that Joseph engages the metaphysicians of his day -- especially the neo-Hegelian idealists, like Bradley, Bosanquet, and Joachim. His criticisms are cogent and invariably well-taken. But in fact Joseph, a Platonist himself, is far closer to the \\"spirit\\" of the British idealists than he is to that of modern more or less analytic philosophy; my own view, at least, is that idealism could easily have taken up his criticisms and moved on.<br />At any rate, this is a fine, fine text, and when I noticed it was in print, I couldn't resist reviewing it.

But it's one of those massively important books that there's just no way to get around. It's easily the most weighty and thorough work of utilitarian ethics since Henry Sidgwick's _The Methods of Ethics_, and it has something of Sidgwick's spirit of judicious reasonableness.<br />Derek Parfit exploded onto the scene with this book in 1984. His work is a goldmine of helpful reflections on, and criticisms of, our ordinary notions of moral behavior, rationality, and personality.<br />The work is divided into four major parts. In the first, he argues that many of our common-sense moral theories are \\"self-defeating\\" in the manner of a Prisoner's Dilemma (which, by the way, is the part that first interested me in the book). In the second, he considers the relations between rationality and time and worries about how we should take the past and the future into ethical account. In the third, he offers a theory of personal identity and its relations to morality. In the fourth, he considers the role that future generations ought to play in our moral deliberations.<br />Well, sure enough, that's _not_ an adequate summary. I haven't even begun to convey the sheer virtuousity with which Parfit raises objections, makes distinctions, brings out difficulties that are so un-obvious that nobody ever noticed them before, and generally develops his arguments with clarity and vigor. Heck, I haven't even adequately conveyed his views themselves.<br />So I guess you'll just have to do what I did: read the book. If you have any interest in ethics, you're going to have to read it _sometime_. So get a copy, put it on your bookshelf, take it down and browse through it once in a while.<br />I'm no utilitarian myself, but if you want to study utilitarian ethical theory, you'll want to read not only this book but also Sidgwick's aforementioned _The Methods of Ethics_. You probably already know to look for Bentham and Mill, and you've probably heard of Samuel Scheffler; you may also want to scare up a copy of Hastings Rashdall's _Theory of Good and Evil_. More recent not-well-known works of a broadly utilitarian bent include Brand Blanshard's _Reason and Goodness_ and Timothy Sprigge's _The Rational Foundations of Ethics_.<br />And on the \\"con\\" side, don't overlook F.H.

A good paradox is something like an incongruity in the structure of the Matrix, an indication that there's something not quite right about our take on reality. Jorge Luis Borges even took paradoxes as evidence of monistic absolute idealism -- proof that the &#34;undivided divinity operating within us&#34; had &#34;dreamt the world&#34; but left in a few &#34;crevices of unreason&#34; so that we could tell we were dreaming. (&#34;Avatars of the Tortoise,&#34; in _Labyrinths_.)<br /><br />I also love Nicholas Rescher's books, of which he's written many. This one is very, very good.<br /><br />Every time Rescher writes a book, it seems, he founds (or at least names) a new discipline. (A graduate student came to see Rescher in his office. The secretary said, &#34;He's writing a book.&#34; &#34;No problem,&#34; said the student; &#34;I'll wait.&#34;) This time it's &#34;aporetics,&#34; the study of paradoxes and their resolution. (An &#34;apory,&#34; Rescher says, is a &#34;group of acceptable-seeming propositions that are collectively inconsistent&#34; [p. 7].)<br /><br />Rescher studies a _lot_ of paradoxes in this volume. Even if you're interested in it only as a sort of bestiary of paradoxes, you'll be impressed by the sheer number of the things he's managed to include. He's combed the philosophical literature from the present day on back through the European Middle Ages clear to ancient Greece. And I'm willing to bet that he didn't miss any of importance.<br /><br />But what's actually supposed to be new here is Rescher's method for dealing with paradoxes. So let's chat about that.<br /><br />First of all, Rescher spends some time discussing the difference between truth and plausibility. His point here is that paradoxes become resoluble if we break them out into propositions, each of which is under consideration as a _candidate_ for truth, but which we can decide to reject if we like. In an aporetic analysis, the propositions in an &#34;aporetic cluster&#34; may have a _presumption_ of acceptability (if they're plausible, which they probably are or we wouldn't have a paradox) but we don't just assume indefeasibly that they're all true.<br /><br />Now, when we get down to cases, what we do is this: when we encounter a paradox/apory, we break it down into a set of propositions that give rise to the paradox. Then we sort the propositions according to their degrees of plausibility. Then, based on the resulting &#34;retention prioritization,&#34; we decide which one(s) to reject. There are some complications here but that's the skinny of it.<br /><br />How far does this take us? Well, frankly, what it's doing is giving us a useful and organized way to _think_ about paradoxes (which of course is no small thing), but not necessarily a method for actually resolving them.<br /><br />First, as Rescher himself acknowledges, different people may have different &#34;retention prioritizations&#34; (as in the &#34;Paradox of Evil,&#34; p. 31, about which, Rescher says, religious believers and committed atheists would presumably disagree). This fact alone means that in lots of controversial cases, Rescher's method will generate different results for different people.<br /><br />Second, and arguably more seriously, it's not altogether clear that different people will break a paradox out into exactly the _same_ set of propositions. On the contrary, I would have thought that actually _finding_ this set of propositions would have been a major subdiscipline of aporetics. But Rescher essentially hands us these on a silver platter and tends to presume that there's no question about how to arrive at them.<br /><br />Third, and probably _most_ seriously, even when we're through with our aporetic analysis, we still may not have satisfactorily resolved our paradox! I'll illustrate with the &#34;Liar Paradox,&#34; which Rescher discusses in his tenth chapter.<br />The &#34;Liar Paradox&#34;arises, of course, from the statement &#34;This statement is false&#34; -- which seems to be true if it's false and false if it's true. Rescher resolves it by breaking it out into a set of propositions that includes this one: &#34;S [the Liar statement] is a semantically meaningful statement -- that is, it is either true or false and not both.&#34; His &#34;retention prioritization&#34; concludes that this is the one to reject; the Liar statement must be dismissed as &#34;semantically meaningless&#34; [p. 202].<br /><br />This is all well and good; at the very least, that proposition is almost undoubtedly the place at which to concentrate one's philosophical fire in an analysis of the Liar Paradox. But does Rescher's analysis really _resolve_ the paradox?<br /><br />I think it does not. Not all readers would agree (I don't) that &#34;semantically meaningful&#34; is identical in meaning to &#34;either true or false and not both&#34;; indeed, if Rescher had broken _this_ proposition out separately, I might have regarded _it_ as the one to reject.<br /><br />Which means that the paradox hasn't really gone away. Indeed, the engine that drives it seems to be our very sense that a statement _can_ be semantically meaningful and yet fail to be decisively true or false. For surely the heart of the paradox is precisely that we _can_ tell what the Liar statement means well enough to recognize that it is self-referring and self-undermining (or, in Rescher's marvellous coinage, &#34;self-counterexemplifying&#34; [p. 194]). We may very well have to dismiss it as semantically meaningless after all -- but the paradox hasn't been resolved until we know _why_. Rescher's method, even if fully sound, would tell us only _that_ we should do so.<br /><br />This isn't a fatal flaw, so long as we don't expect to use Rescher's aporetic analysis for more than it can do. As a method of organizing our thoughts when we sit down to think through a paradox, it's very, very good. It's just not complete (and probably isn't supposed to be) as a method for actually figuring out what makes a paradox tick and what we should do about it.<br /><br />If you enjoy paradoxes even a tenth as much as I do, you'll like this book.<br /><br />If you're just starting to investigate the subject, I recommend William Poundstone's _Labyrinths of Reason_ and Mark Sainsbury's _Paradoxes_ as introductory volumes. Eventually you'll also want to get around to Barwise and Etchemendy's book on the Liar Paradox, Raymond Smullyan's books, Douglas Hofstadter's _Goedel, Escher, Bach_, and Rudy Rucker's _Infinity and the Mind_, and a host of others.false if it's true.

We may very well have to dismiss it as semantically meaningless after all -- but the paradox hasn't been resolved until we know _why_. Rescher's method, even if fully sound, would tell us only _that_ we should do so.  This isn't a fatal flaw, so long as we don't expect to use Rescher's aporetic analysis for more than it can do. As a method of organizing our thoughts when we sit down to think through a paradox, it's very, very good. It's just not complete (and probably isn't supposed to be) as a method for actually figuring out what makes a paradox tick and what we should do about it.  If you enjoy paradoxes even a tenth as much as I do, you'll like this book.  If you're just starting to investigate the subject, I recommend William Poundstone's _Labyrinths of Reason_ and Mark Sainsbury's _Paradoxes_ as introductory volumes. Eventually you'll also want to get around to Barwise and Etchemendy's book on the Liar Paradox, Raymond Smullyan's books, Douglas Hofstadter's _Goedel, Escher, Bach_, and Rudy Rucker's _Infinity and the Mind_, and a host of others.	2002-12-11

It's not the sort of thing I ordinarily like, but on its own terms I think it's pretty successful. (I don't give away any important plot details in what follows.)<br />The premise is that in the year 2015 the earth suffers some really serious climate changes that push humanity to the brink of extinction. So far it sounds like just another apocalyptic novel, right? But don't expect _On The Beach_ or _Earth Abides_, or even _Lucifer's Hammer_.<br />You see, the central character is a scientist named Werther Fausten, and that pileup of Goethe allusions isn't accidental. Oh, and there's also a dragon.<br />It's a more or less scientifically plausible dragon, to be sure, but that's not really the point. The dragon is actually, we learn, some sort of embodiment of the collective unconscious of humankind. (If it physically exists at all -- a point author Chuck Rosenthal carefully leaves unresolved. The story is told in the first person -- well, various first persons -- through letters, journal excerpts, and such.)<br />Anyway, the dragon in some sense represents, and perhaps nonmetaphorically just _is_, humanity's \\"shadow side.\\" And besides being rather unpleasant to be around in general, she also has a good deal to say on the subject of science and monotheism (which she declares to be similar in all sorts of bad ways that are more than coincidentally related to the meterological catastrophe). Obviously we're in a different and altogether more Jungian world from that of most apocalyptic fiction.<br />Can humanity be saved? If so, how? Readers who know their Jung will have a pretty good idea where this is all headed, but it's well written and well crafted. Readers who (like me) don't have any particular problems with science and monotheism will still appreciate the artistry of the novel and find its warnings cogent and timely. And at any rate, there's no reason to assume the dragon's opinions are necessarily those of the author. (Hee hee. For how many books would _that_ disclaimer be appropriate?)<br />Okay, that's about all I can tell you without spoiling it for you. Again, it's not my usual cup of tea, but based on the quality of this novel I'd read something else by Rosenthal.w many books would _that_ disclaimer be appropriate?)<br />Okay, that's about all I can tell you without spoiling it for you.

Fortunately, Steven Nadler has given it a go. The result is as close to a definitive biography of Spinoza as we're likely to see for many years to come.<br />Naturally, much of the material on Spinoza himself is speculative (and clearly identified as such). But Nadler does a marvelous job of placing Spinoza into his historical context. The discussions of Dutch and Jewish history are fascinating in their own right, and Nadler's exposition of Jewish law is competent as well (a nice feature for obvious reasons). Moreover, Nadler doesn't hesitate to state his own opinions where the evidence warrants it, and more than once he speaks up against commonplace misconceptions that have crept into the \\"received account\\" of Spinoza's life.<br />I'm also very impressed by Nadler's transparent and engaging style. The art of expository prose is hardly noticed when it's done right, which is why I try to call attention to it whenever I encounter it. Nadler does it right. His sentences are well phrased and comfortably paced, and he doesn't obtrude himself with authorial tricks; he just tells the story clearly and well. This sounds easy and is not.<br />Be warned that, as other reviewers have noted, this is not (just) an intellectual biography of Spinoza. The narrative does cover the development of his philosophy, but in just enough depth to give the reader a sense of what it's about; for exposition of Spinozism, you'll want to read either Spinoza himself or Roger Scruton's little book on the subject. (Start with Scruton if you're new to Spinoza.)<br />Highly recommended to readers interested in Spinoza as well as to readers who simply enjoy a fine historical biography.	2002-11-18
1342680:US	52474360	R1ZANN3Z4QDZZW	157322829X	908876211	Coercion: Why We Listen to What "They" Say	Books	5	55	59	N	N	How "they" short-circuit our better judgment	Douglas Rushkoff used to be a lot more hopeful that the rise of the Internet would free us from the \\"arms race\\" of manipulation and counter-manipulation to which we're subjected through the major media. He's changed his mind, in part because he found that his earlier work (notably the famous _Media Virus!_) was being taught in marketing classes to people who wanted to _create_ media viruses.<br />But he hasn't turned into a pessimist; he still thinks we can break the cycle, and this book is supposed to help us do it. And given his subject, he writes with a refreshing lack of paranoia: he's well aware that all of these techniques are (a) based on common features of \\"human nature\\" that ordinarily serve us just fine, and (b) used all the time, to some degree, by all of us. \\"We are all coercers,\\" he says,\\" and we are all coerced.\\"<br />As you read the book, it will help to be aware of something Rushkoff doesn't actually get around to explaining until his closing chapter: by \\"coercion\\" he means the sort of \\"persuasion\\" that is intended to make it difficult or impossible for us to exercise our better judgment -- as distinguished from genuine, no-scare-quotes persuasion, which engages our reason rather than trying to short-circuit it. Bear that in mind if you think -- as I initially did -- that he's confusing coercion and persuasion.<br />What he's actually talking about is what people of approximately my generation would at one time have called a \\"mind-cop.\\" (That term, by the way, has very nearly the same literal meaning as \\"geneivat da'at,\\" or \\"stealing the mind\\" -- a term used in Jewish law for certain sorts of deception.) I assume no reader of this page will need me to explain that there's something ethically wrong with such practices, even though they fall short of physical force or the threat thereof. Indeed, by my lights, the sort of thing Rushkoff writes about, being a violation of the integrity of the mind, seems somehow _more_ wrong than the \\"initiation of force.\\"<br />At any rate the subject should be of interest to a wide range of readers. I'll single out two kinds: (1) readers interested in the psychology of judgment and decision-making (and see Scott Plous's excellent book of that title for a good introduction), and (2) law students. (Yes, law students. It's relevant to all sorts of questions that arise in the study of the law: How are juries persuaded? When may a contract be rescinded? Why does the law protect stuff like \\"brand identities\\" and \\"public images\\"?)<br />Rushkoff's discussion covers a pretty wide range of methods, from advertising to PR, from \\"atmospherics\\" to pyramid schemes. One of his greatest strengths is his ability to draw parallels between, for example, CIA interrogation techniques and Nazi rallies, on the one hand, and sales techniques on the other, _without_ making you feel as though he's pushing a wild-eyed conspiracy theory. The narrative is also peppered with on-point personal anecdotes, and his passages on \\"cults\\" are downright spine-tingling. (And if you've ever felt a little funny about the popularity of Dale Carnegie's famous book, you'll like what Rushkoff has to say about it.)<br />Above all, don't make the mistake of dismissing Rushkoff as a \\"leftist\\" (as he says has happened to him). The political division between \\"right\\" and \\"left\\" is so malleable as to be almost meaningless. The relevant political division is between authoritarians/corporatists/statists and libertarians/populists, and Rushkoff is firmly in the anti-\\"authoritarian\\" camp. He's under no illusion that the government is going to Protect Us From All This; indeed some of his own examples demonstrate just the opposite. He's out to free us, not find a new way to enslave us.<br />Rushkoff's musings on the nature of \\"coercion\\" should also lead us to reflect on the nature of the \\"free market.\\" According to libertarians (including me), the \\"free market\\" is simply the society that results when people respect each other's rights/integrity and engage one another only in voluntary relationships. But can a relationship based on \\"coercion,\\" based on getting the other person to exercise something less than his or her best judgment, indeed based on anything less than full disclosure and fully informed consent, really be called voluntary?<br />If not, then the old Roman-law-based \\"caveat emptor\\" standard doesn't belong in the _real_ free market, and a very great deal of what we've been _told_ is the \\"free market\\" is really something else. A genuinely free market, in which all \\"exchanges\\" were truly informed and voluntary, would be communitarian rather than corporate-statist -- less, that is, like the military-industrial complex and more like a Grateful Dead concert ;-).<br />Anyway, Rushkoff's book is very nicely done, and bound to appeal to those of us who think we're skilled in the art of \\"crap detecting\\" -- a phrase I first encountered nearly thirty years ago in the brilliant _Teaching as a Subversive Activity_, by Neil Postman and Charles Weingartner.

At the very least, author David Rey Echt has changed his name to \\"Trevor\\" for the purposes of the narrative. I don't know how much of it is really supposed to have happened. But it doesn't matter, because the novel is true in the most important sense: something really did happen during the Summer of Love, and it wasn't just that a bunch of kids did a lot of drugs and had a lot of sex.<br />Zen master Seung Sahn once remarked to his then-disciple-and-protege Stephen Mitchell that the hippie mind was just a quarter-inch away from enlightenment. You'll find similar views echoed everywhere from Stephen Gaskin and Ram Dass to (more recently) Skip Stone's _Hippies A to Z_ and John Bassett McCleary's _The Hippie Dictionary_. And on my own website I write as follows: \\"It may be best to regard the hippie movement, on its spiritual side, as a recent example of that perennial underground countercultural mysticism that always seems to swell up, like grass through the cracks in the sidewalk, whenever a dogmatic and/or authoritarian worldview, religious or otherwise, holds cultural sway.\\"<br />So you may well imagine that I'll be sympathetic to a novel suggesting that at the heart of all of this is a spiritual event that . . . well, I'd better not spoil it for anyone who hasn't read it yet. But fictional or not, the personal journey described in this book is realistic, and the spiritual advice is sound. (For whatever it's worth, this review is being written by someone who has been known to tote around a battered copy of Stephen Gaskin's _This Seasons' People._) Echt has clearly done his spiritual homework.<br />What can I tell you _without_ spoiling anything? Just that it follows the travels of a young man named Trevor from Topanga Canyon to San Francisco on a journey of spiritual enlightenment.<br />I can also tell you that there's some serious mojo in this book (or, more precisely, accessible \\"through\\" it, if you know what I mean). There are a few passages that will actually give you the spiritual equivalent of a contact high just from reading them. That's a nice feature, given the aim of the book.<br />If you lived through this period of time (whether or not you were at ground zero), this book will help to remind you of its real meaning. If not, the first-person narrative will show you what the air tasted like, so to speak. Either way, this text can push you a little further toward mindfulness, if you want it to.<br />One last thing -- I absolutely hate to Deduct Points For Spelling, so I'm going to pretend I gave it four and a half stars. But the reader should be aware that there are lots of typos and grammatical gaffes that got past the proofreader(s). This doesn't bother everybody, and I don't have any particular problem reading around such things myself. (And I think it's good to be understanding about the fact that, particularly at non-mainstream publishers, authors are often left to proofread their own books.) Nevertheless, if you _do_ care about such things, be warned.isco on a journey of spiritual enlightenment.<br />I can also tell you that there's some serious mojo in this book (or, more precisely, accessible \\"through\\" it, if you know what I mean).

It's also a good book for anybody who wants to get a sense of just how blinkin' _weird_ American legal education is.<br />Lawrence Dieker conceives the book as a sort of sequel to Scott Turow's _One L_ (which I've never read, so I can't compare the two). It's a fictional, or at least fictionalized, account of a law student's _second_ year at Tulane Law School. (Law school is ordinarily a three-year program, so Year Two is when students typically start trying to find jobs in the legal profession; much of this book is taken up with the ups and downs and ins and outs of the Job Hunt. And according to a common saying about law school, reproduced on the book's back cover, the second year is when they work you to death.)<br />It's well done. The authorial voice is that of the student, and the story is told as a series of vignettes that read rather like diary excerpts. The slice-of-life effect is earned; the tale is a pretty realistic account of what second-year law students go through, although I suspect things are probably a good deal more intense at the \\"top\\" schools than at the not-so-top ones. (I'm in a four-year evening program and I've had a day job for years, so I've missed out on a lot of these 2L joys myself.)<br />The writing is solid and competent, the style crisp and clear, the characters usually at least interesting. Anal-retentive readers will also want to award Dieker extra credit for correctly spelling \\"minuscule\\" (though he loses a couple of points for confusing \\"principal\\" and \\"principle\\" in the passages about agency law and for using \\"criteria\\" as a singular at one point). The students' dawning realizations about the nature of law-school exams are spot-on. Plus there are a few good lawyer jokes scattered throughout.<br />I'd strongly recommend it to anybody considering a law career. (Don't wait until your second year to read it; read it before you start.) I'd also recommend it to anybody who wants some insight into what education tends to become in a guild-like profession entry into which is limited by law.nsight into what education tends to become in a guild-like profession entry into which is limited by law.	2002-09-10

I had a copy of it in the 1970s, when it was first published, and I recently got around to replacing my copy.<br />If you enjoy the _Science Fiction Hall of Fame_ collections, you'll enjoy this one too. At the time of its publication, it was one of very few collections of all-new SF. And Robert Silverberg and Roger Elwood selected (almost) nothing but the best. (There are a couple I don't particularly care for, but at least none of them are real stinkers.)<br />There is, for example, Harry Harrison's \\"Run From the Fire,\\" a great parallel-universe tale. There's Clifford Simak's bittersweet \\"The Ghost of a Model T,\\" which just drips with nostalgia. There's R.A. Lafferty's \\"For All Poor Folks at Picketwire\\" (and if you know who R.A. Lafferty is, the mention of his name is all you'll need here). There's a full novella by Jack Vance.<br />There's also my personal favorite in the book, and one of my favorite SF short stories ever: George R.R. Martin's \\". . . for a single yesterday.\\" This is one of the most haunting pieces of fiction you're ever going to read. It takes place on a rural hippie commune after The Blast has destroyed the cities. The title is, of course, a line from the Kris Kristofferson/Fred Foster song \\"Me and Bobby McGee,\\" which figures into the tale. I won't spoil it for you by telling you anything more; just read it. (It was memories of this particular story that led me to hunt down a used copy of this book in the first place.)<br />If you like good SF, scare up a copy of this collection.

This isn't just a dictionary or a \\"hippie glossary\\"; though it includes lots of words and phrases from the common countercultural parlance of the 1960s and '70s, it also includes (short) historical and ideological summaries, together with some stuff you wouldn't expect to find in such a source.<br /><br />(Here's one example: McCleary quite rightly devotes many pages' worth of attention to the computer/Internet revolution, which probably a lot of people _still_ don't realize is part of the hippie legacy. McCleary has also starred the entries for the people he regards as most influential -- e.g. Dr. King -- and the words/phrases that have had the most impact -- e.g. \\"cool.\\" And there are pages and pages and pages of lists at the back of the book.)<br /><br />There are a few glitches that force me to deduct a little bit from his rating. For example, McCleary consistently refers to Henry David Thoreau's essay \\"On the Duty of Civil Disobedience\\" as a \\"book\\" -- and, moreover, claims to have found the phrase \\"Question Authority\\" in it. This isn't a serious problem but there are enough little things like it that I can't award full points to what is, after all, supposed to be a reliable reference book. On the other hand, most of this stuff is so clearly the result of deadline pressure that I hate to deduct more than half a star, so let's just say I'm rating it at 4.5 stars.<br /><br />McCleary does pretty much everything else just right. I'd like to have seen a bit more about the influence of science fiction on 1960s ideals (and maybe even an entry on SF writer Spider Robinson, whose work deliberately and consistently embodies those ideals). But McCleary does work in some references to SF; indeed his list of relevant period literature includes not one but _two_ novels by Robert A. Heinlein. (He also makes liberal use of the term \\"grok,\\" although his spelling of it is inconsistent.)<br /><br />And I agree with so many of McCleary's own evaluations that I wonder whether we've been reading each others' minds. His entries on, e.g., Stephen Gaskin, Willie Nelson, and James Taylor are just right, and his entry on the meaning of \\"true hippie\\" is smack on the mark. (And I'm glad he kept his historical summaries short; the book would have swelled to unmanageable size if he'd devoted more than a paragraph or two to each event.)<br /><br />In short, this isn't just a reference; it's an extended argument for keeping The Dream alive. As McCleary writes under the entry for \\"true hippie,\\" if the world had listened to the hippies thirty years ago, 9/11 wouldn't have happened. (And of course I do mean \\"the world,\\" including especially the terrorists themselves.)<br /><br />In that spirit -- keeping the fire alive, that is -- you may want to pick up Skip Stone's uneven _Hippies A to Z_ as a short companion volume.<br /><br />(Note: If you buy this book for your kids to read, be aware that there's _lots_ of stuff about sex in it.

Oh, there are parts I'd have handled differently, and I wish he'd ridden a couple of _my_ favorite hobby horses (the influence of science fiction being one subject to which I wish he'd devoted more space). But I learned to live long ago with my disappointment that not everything will fit into one book.<br />And what _is_ in the book is pretty uniformly excellent. Riggenbach begins, for example, by locating libertarianism/anarchism in U.S. history, correctly naming e.g. Emerson, Thoreau, and some of their contemporaries as examples of this tradition. And he has a fine chapter on Ayn Rand that goes far toward explaining why hippies liked her so much better than she liked them. (He notes -- correctly, in my opinion -- that Rand never really got around to writing any serious philosophy. He treats her, though, as a brilliantly incisive essayist and polemicist, which I think is partly true but too kind by half.)<br />I could disagree with bits and pieces of it. (I think, for example, that Riggenbach tends to exaggerate the allegedly rightward turn Murray Rothbard took in later life.) But it's all very well done.<br />At any rate, Riggenbach supports his thesis well; libertarianism is indeed the hippie/counterculture legacy, at least in its political aspect. Be warned, though: since I so largely agreed with him before I read the book, I may not be a fair test of how persuasive he is.	2002-08-27

Well, I'm happy to report an exception. Robert J. Sawyer writes excellent stuff, and this book seems to be as good a place as any to start (both reading and reviewing).<br /><br />I tend to evaluate SF writers/books along two dimensions -- one for the techie stuff, as measured against James P. Hogan (one of my two favorite living SF writers), and one for the humaneness of the characterization and plot, as measured against Spider Robinson (my other favorite). It's hard to find anybody who does well at both; Charles Sheffield, for example, rates pretty high on the first axis but not too high on the second, and Connie Willis is approximately the reverse.<br /><br />Well, Sawyer measures up well along both dimensions. His plots include both plausible extrapolations from current science and his characters are always interesting and engaging. And he writes very well; it's hard to put one of his books down once you've started it.<br /><br />This one is no exception, and it's one of his more ambitious efforts to date. The plot: a non-Terran spacecraft sets down outside the Royal Ontario Museum, and an eight-legged alien (named, as it later emerges, Hollus) walks into the museum and asks to see a paleontologist.<br /><br />The paleontologist on call happens to be Tom Jericho, who happens to have cancer. And when he learns that on Hollus's planet, scientists think it's just _obvious_ that the universe was designed by an intelligent God, he finds that he has to deal with his own reasons for not believing in God. (\\"If there were a God, cancer wouldn't exist.\\" The Oncological Argument?)<br /><br />Most of the plot is devoted to scientific and philosophical discussions between Jericho and Hollus. These are well done; Sawyer is right on the money in his characterizations both of the shortcomings of Darwinian theory and of the \\"fine-tuned\\" nature of the universe. (Check out Michael Denton's _Evolution: A Theory in Crisis_ and _Nature's Destiny_ for good discussions of all this stuff.)<br /><br />Sawyer's own speculative resolution of these issues probably won't please too many traditional theists and I think it's questionable on other grounds as well. But hey, that's what speculative fiction is about, and Sawyer's speculations are veeeeeery interesting even when they're not altogether convincing. (I won't spoil things by giving away any details, but I think I can mention that the Oncological Argument does receive an answer in the end.

Charles Sheffield knows his science; in fact, to prove it, he's included an appendix that summarizes the astronomical/cosmological theories on which this tale is founded. He even makes reference to Frank Tipler's _The Physics of Immortality_, making this the second book I've recently read that does so. (The other is Robert Sawyer's _Flashforward_.)<br />But the story itself is Asimovian in the best and worst senses. Like the Good Doctor, Sheffield is ambitious in his reach: this is a _cosmic_ story, with a breathtakingly wide scope. But also like the Good Doctor, he tends to give his characters made-up-sounding pseudo-futuristic names like Fundular Threem or Gordis Pulge (both of which I just now made up, but they sure sound Asimovian, don't they?). And like the Good Doctor, he sometimes lets the scope of the tale get in the way of the telling, resorting to broad, summary expositions rather than actual drama.<br />Well, the story is captivating, at least. The first portion -- Drake Merlin making arrangements for himself and his wife Ana to be cryonically preserved until a cure is available for her disease -- is well-written and well-paced. The first round of Drake's future awakening is handled well too.<br />But it starts to come apart after that. First of all, Drake does something so incredibly, astoundingly, outrageously, mind-bendingly _stupid_ (I won't tell you what, but you'll know when you get there) that it just about ruins the character and the plot. Second, the end of the first portion of the book leaves (let's say) something to be desired in the way of personal continuity.<br />And third, the latter portion of the story -- the stuff in the way-far future -- is probably just a little more than Sheffield should have bitten off. I won't give away any details here, but it's just not possible to tell that part of the tale without resorting to the summary exposition I mentioned above. The narrative tends to drag, there isn't much dramatic action, and we don't even get to see the final resolution of the problem Drake is supposed to be trying to solve.<br />The ending is pretty good, considering. And I can't fault Sheffield for aiming high, so I give him lots of points for ambition. Nevertheless there are enough unsatisfying features that I have to deduct a star.<br />Still, it's nicely done overall, and well worth reading.don't even get to see the final resolution of the problem Drake is supposed to be trying to solve.<br />The ending is pretty good, considering.

But it's a darned fine book. It's difficult to review it without including any spoilers, but I won't give away any details that you wouldn't learn in the first few pages.<br />Here's the deal: It's 2021, and software developer Scott Warden is hanging out in Thailand with his wife and daughter when a big giant monument just sort of _appears_ out of nowhere, causing massive damage and death. What's even odder is that an inscription on the monument (dubbed a \\"Chronolith\\" by journalists) makes clear that it commemorates some sort of military victory by somebody named \\"Kuin\\" -- twenty years and three months in the future.<br />The rest of the story, of course, I'm not going to tell you. But it's very cool.<br />It will probably take you eighty or a hundred pages to get your mind around Warden (at least it did me). He's not in general a very sympathetic character, but give him time to grow on you; he's as interestingly flawed as, say, Charlie Armstead in Spider and Jeanne Robinson's _Stardance_, and you'll find that there _are_ reasons he's the way he is.<br />You'll also like Sulamith (Sue) Chopra, an academic odd duck who is both an engaging character and a handy person to have around for another reason.<br />See, most of the actual _science_ in this book takes place offstage, and Wilson relies on a device that's at least as old as Dr. John H. Watson's chronicles of Sherlock Holmes: there really _is_ some science behind the events in the novel, but the narrator isn't the one who knows it, so he conveniently doesn't have to explain it. Well, Sue Chopra does know it, and she gets to give little bits of pseudo-explanation in terms of \\"tau turbulence\\" and such -- but since Warden, rather implausibly, just can't get a handle on her explanations, the reader never really learns much about it. (That's the main reason I deducted a star from the book's rating.)<br />But boy, does the narrative draw you in. You'll probably have a hard time putting it down. You won't have any trouble keeping the characters straight, either; Wilson paces things nicely and gets everybody properly introduced. And it does all come together in the end, very neatly.<br />Don't expect a hope-filled, Spider-Robinson-like resolution, though; this is a pretty dark book and the characters are put pretty thoroughly through the mill.<br />(By the way, extra points to Tor Books for a very nice piece of cover art. Unlike Baen, Tor seems to have its covers designed by people who actually read the books, and that view of the giant Chronolith next to the Wat comes straight out of the text.)ut boy, does the narrative draw you in.

Because this book squarely faces a number of interesting and difficult problems, _and works them through to resolution_, it's actually a profoundly hopeful story despite its apocalyptic backdrop.<br />Spider is one of my favorite two living SF writers (the other being James Hogan), and this is about as close as Spider comes to writing \\"hard\\" SF.

Hogan is one of my two favorite living SF writers and the only one of the two who writes \\"hard\\" SF (the other one is Spider Robinson). I've been reading his stuff since the late 1970s and I think this novel is one of his best.<br /><br />The premise, of course, is that virtual reality has reached such an advanced stage of development that it's not easy to distinguish the \\"virtual\\" from the \\"real\\"; the essential plot element is that Joe Corrigan is trapped inside a simulation he helped to create. The reader knows all of this from the beginning, but for obvious reasons (and some that are not so obvious) it takes the protagonist a while to work it out.<br /><br />That's where much of the tension in the novel comes from. It's so clear to the reader what's going on that you'll want to reach into the page and say, \\"Joe, man, wake up and _think_. Don't you _know_ where you are?\\" This effect is heightened by a couple of really really obvious details that you'll almost physically itch for Joe to notice.<br /><br />But much of what makes the story _interesting_ is the extremely plausible tale Hogan tells about the development of the technology itself. Hogan does this sort of thing better than nearly any other SF writer past or present, and this novel is no exception; indeed, when virtual reality really does reach this level of development, it may well have gotten there by roughly the path Hogan describes.<br /><br />Anyway, I can't tell you much else without spoiling the story. All I can do is mention in a general way that, as usual with Hogan, the story is full of mind-blowingly cool touches.<br /><br />But speaking of spoilers, here's a warning: just inside the front cover, the current edition includes an excerpt that you probably shouldn't read before you read the book. Somebody made a bad editorial decision here: the excerpt comes from near the _end_ of the book and it gives some things away too early.<br /><br />Hogan is all-but-unarguably the finest writer of \\"hard\\" SF today.

How would you organize it?)<br /><br />If you're the protagonist in this fascinating SF novel, you're probably in for some interesting experiences. But will you get to keep them?<br /><br />(If you're James P. Hogan, you tell the story in chunks, cycling through the various nonoverlapping personalities and telling the parts of the tale for which each is \\"present,\\" as it were.)<br /><br />Who do you turn out to be? Are you one person or several? Which hero saves the day, and which hero  _gets_ saved? Are they the same person? Are you sure?<br /><br />Hogan is in fine narrative form here. I've seen his writing described as \\"textbook-dry,\\" but that's not likely to dissuade those of us who regard, say, Kernighan and Ritchie's _The C Programming Language_ as the pinnacle of expository prose style. Hogan writes like a _good_ engineer; his prose does the job he wants it to do, and the meat is in the story. (You don't need mannered digressions about the splendid colors of the autumn leaves in a book whose theme is that the universe isn't what you think it is.)<br /><br />In fact this is a fun book, full of Hogan's trademark mind-blowing coolness. The underlying technology is rendered plausible and the story is interesting from beginning to end. Even if you know what must be going on -- and you will, by midway through the second chapter, even if you hadn't figured it out from the title -- you'll still be kept guessing until the very end about (a) how and why it happened, and (b) how it will ultimately turn out.<br /><br />Hogan is one of my two favorite living SF writers (the other is Spider Robinson, who doesn't write \\"hard\\" SF).

The third volume, _Starmind_ is available separately.<br />Both of the books included here are excellent -- the first one, I think, just slightly moreso, but the sequel is way better than sequels usually are. The premise: dancer Shara Drummond, too tall and zaftig to be accepted as a dancer on Earth, hooks up with Charlie Armstead to shift her career to an orbital environment where her size isn't a liability. While they're up there . . . well, that's what the book is about.<br />And of course I can't tell you _anything_ about the sequel without spoiling the first book for you.<br />At any rate, these were the first two of the three books that the happy Robinson couple cowrote, and they work together mighty well. Jeanne is clearly no slouch as a writer -- and at the time these books were written, she led a dance company in Nova Scotia. Spider's delightful sensibilities inform the entire project too, and you'll meet some of his most memorable characters here. (Fat Humphrey comes to mind.)<br />I don't like the third volume quite as well, largely because I don't care for the ending. But pick it up too, just so you'll have read them all. The Robinsons don't just recycle the same story from one book to the next; they tell a genuinely new story in each one.<br />Check out Spider's solo work too.

He makes plausible projections from present-day science and uses them as the basis for a story (which generally includes the story of the discovery of the scientific principles at issue).<br />This is one of my favorites. In it, Hogan explores a mind-blowingly cool scientific concept: what if it were possible for information to travel from the future to the past?<br />\\"Classic\\" SF treatments of time-travel themes leave something to be desired -- even Robert A. Heinlein's fine short story \\"By His Bootstraps,\\" which depends for its success on several narrative tricks that work in the story but aren't very realistic elsewhere. (The protagonist has to relive the same series of events several times, from different points of view, without really being able to _make decisions_ as this happens.) Others allow the possibility of changing the past but allege that _actually_ changing it would somehow make the universe go blooey. A few allow the past actually to be changed but don't explain how it's possible (in particular ducking the obvious paradoxes).<br />So Hogan started from scratch and tried to provide a plausible scientific basis for his own tale. And what he came up with was a way that information from the future _can_ change the past -- with, let's say, _very_ interesting consequences for his characters, including a host of brand new moral problems and hard choices. As I suggested above, the story is (like most \\"hard\\" SF) fundamentally idea-driven rather than character-driven, but Hogan's characters are believable and interesting all the same.<br />If you enjoy this sort of thing, you'll also want to read his later novel _Paths To Otherwhere_ for exploration of the Many Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics. And check out _The Proteus Operation_ for yet another fascinating twist on the time-travel/changing-the-past theme.	2002-08-15

(If you're just now being introduced to this book, check out Hofstadter's too; his discussion of it is very helpful and insightful.)<br /><br />What Robert Axelrod describes in this book is a novel round-robin tournament (actually two such tournaments) in which various game-theoretic strategies were pitted against one another in the game known as the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. Each strategy was scored, not according to how many times it \\"beat\\" its \\"opponent,\\" but according to how many points it accumulated for itself. The surprising result: a strategy dubbed TIT FOR TAT, submitted by Anatol Rapaport, cleaned everybody's clocks in both tournaments.<br /><br />Why was this surprising? First, because TIT FOR TAT was such a simple strategy. It didn't try to figure out what its \\"opponent\\" was going to do, or even keep much track of what its \\"opponent\\" had _already_ done. All it did was cooperate on the first move, and thereafter do whatever its \\"opponent\\" had done on the previous move. And second, because this strategy can _never_ do better than its \\"opponent\\" in any single game; the best result it could achieve, in terms of comparison with the other player, is a tie.<br /><br />So it was odd that such a simple strategy, one that went up against all sorts of sophisticated strategies that spent a lot of time trying to dope out what their \\"opponents\\" were up to, should do so much better than all the \\"clever\\" strategies. And it was also odd that a strategy that could never, ever \\"beat\\" its \\"opponent\\" should nevertheless do so much better _overall_ than any other strategy.<br /><br />As Axelrod is careful to point out, this isn't always true; how well TIT FOR TAT does depends on the population with which it's surrounded, and in fact it wouldn't have won even _these_ tournaments if certain other strategies had participated. But TIT FOR TAT is surprisingly robust, and its success does offer some tentative political lessons.<br /><br />Axelrod spells them out, in the form of principles like \\"Be nice and forgiving\\" -- which means: never be the first to defect; be quick to forget what your \\"opponent\\" has done in the past. And in a follow-up computer simulation, he shows that it's possible -- under some conditions -- for a little cadre of \\"cooperators\\" to increase their numbers and \\"take over\\" a population that practices other strategies.<br /><br />Axelrod's research was and is important for several reasons, one of which has to do with evolutionary theory: it shows that, under the right conditions, natural selection can tend to generate cooperation rather than competition, even among actors who act solely out of self-interest. Another has to do with the spontaneous growth of cooperative behavior in predominantly competitive or hostile environments (Axelrod's examples include holiday cease-fires in the trenches during the First World War). Yet another has to do with the need (or otherwise) for external authorities to _enforce_ cooperative behavior -- a point not lost on Axelrod's libertarian and/or Hayekian readers, including myself.<br /><br />Nevertheless, as groundbreaking as this work is, the results are modest and Axelrod states them very cautiously. TIT FOR TAT doesn't _always_ \\"win,\\" and in any case not all of our social interactions can be modelled as Iterated Prisoner's Dilemmas. It's a _very_ hopeful book, but readers will want to be careful not to claim more for Axelrod's results than he claims for them himself.<br /><br />In short, this volume is a solid piece of political-sociological-mathematical research that has stood the test of time and stimulated all sorts of follow-up work. I expect it will be read for a long time to come -- this conclusion being a simple extrapolation from the fact that I've been reading it for almost two decades now myself. It's fascinating.	2002-08-11

Hogan's SF since the late 1970s, when I picked up a copy of his second novel, _The Genesis Machine_. I still haven't read the \\"Giants\\" novels, but I've read quite a bit of his other stuff.<br />He's got a nice range, from hard SF like this book to espionage thrillers like _The Infinity Gambit_ to nonfiction essays on various controversial subjects. (You can read a lot of his nonfiction on his website...)<br />The emphasis in his science fiction is on \\"science\\"; he knows his stuff and the physical theories on which he founds his novels are pretty plausible. He's also got a keen eye for the absolutely mind-blowingingly cool detail: some event that seems entirely ordinary but has such profound implications about the nature of reality that you just put the book down for a moment and go \\"Wow.\\"...<br />Since he's one of my two favorite living SF writers and the only one of the two who writes \\"hard\\" SF (the other is Spider Robinson), I've lately been trying to figure out where to start reviewing his books. I picked this one because it registers so high on the Mind-Blowing Coolness Meter, but I could really have started anywhere.<br />No spoilers here: all the details I'm about to divulge appear within the first few pages of the book. Here's the underlying premise: the Many-Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct; it's possible for quanta to interfere with their own counterparts along other branches of events; it's also possible for _information_ to be passed from one branch to another, and even from the future to the past, with devices that detect such interference.<br />One of those mind-blowing details occurs during a test of just such a device: a woman deliberately mistypes a word on a computer keyboard, but it appears correctly on the screen -- _because the quantum interference detector is determining the output by averaging all the possible futures_. Similarly, the woman finds it amazingly easy to draw a perfect circle on the computer screen, because the device averages _out_ the random errors introduced by her and all her counterparts along the other branches of the Multiverse.<br />That's just a taste of what this novel has in store for you, and it's just background; the plot is even cooler, and I won't spoil it for you. Let it suffice to say that you'll get your mind blown at least once every forty or fifty pages; every time you think Hogan has run out of tricks, he manages to pull out another one. His characters are, if not altogether gripping, at least interesting enough to keep the plot moving (Theo Jantowitz, for example, is a charming academic curmudgeon) and his standard theme -- \\"good science getting screwed up by government and corporate interests\\" -- is treated with Hogan's usual realism and flair.<br />In general it's a well-written and hopeful book that explores a fascinating \\"rational mysticism\\" that I sort of hope turns out to be true. (And I'm not sure why a couple of the other reviewers are dissatisfied with Hogan's handling of a certain \\"moral problem\\"; in fact it's not only addressed repeatedly but very nicely resolved.)<br />But again, I just picked this book to review because I had to start _somewhere_...

I was introduced to it when I was in graduate school (mathematics) and rooming in the house of a physics professor who swore by Richard Threlkeld Cox's account of subjective probability. I haven't had a copy of it in my hand for nearly twenty years; I happened across this page today and ordered it at once. So pardon me while I gush:<br />What Cox accomplishes in this deceptively slim volume is amazing. He places Bayesian probability theory on an axiomatic foundation, as a natural extension of Boolean logic, identifying probabilities with degrees of subjective belief in propositions rather than directly with frequencies of events (though he also argues that the subjectivist interpretation accords with the frequentist interpretation whenever the latter makes sense at all).<br />Essentially, he shows that the ordinary laws of probability theory are normative laws of thought that apply to degrees of belief in propositions, and that we have to conform to them if we want to think consistently.<br />If you like math and logic books, you'll find this one eminently readable; I haven't seen it in years and yet I still remember the stunning clarity of Cox's rigorous exposition.<br />This is the book that originally sold me on Bayesianism. If you have any interest in this subject at all, grab this one while it's available.	2002-08-01

It's even better than I expected.<br />Trager's approach is suited to his subject. Rather than write a straightforward biography -- which would be difficult in any case because there are so many unanswered and unanswerable questions -- Trager has opted to tell His Lordship's life story through a sort of montage of mostly oral history. For this purpose he has interviewed, apparently, just about every living person on this sweet swingin' sphere who knew the Hip Messiah or was directly influenced by him in some way, and supplemented the interviews with excerpts from articles and other sources.<br />This approach makes the book read a bit like an extended episode of \\"Biography,\\" flipping back and forth between the interviewees' reminiscences and the author's comments. It's not at all hard to follow; Trager even uses a different typeface for his own comments so we can tell what's narrative and what's not, and each interviewee/writer is clearly named at the beginning of each excerpt. (Each is introduced the first time one of his or her comments appears. If you forget who somebody is, you can flip to the back of the book and look up his first appearance; there's a list.)<br />It's about time somebody did a biography of The Lord of Flip Manor, and Trager's approach is highly appropriate to his subject. For example, by telling the story through the voices of others, he's able to present all the conflicting theories about Buckley's mysterious death without having to decide which one is most likely to be true. And more generally, since so much of Buckley's persona was realized through his interactions with other people anyway, it's fitting to present his life through the responses he created in the people around him. (You'll be amazed at the people he's influenced. Some of them are pretty obvious -- Robin Williams, Captain Beefheart, and so forth. But James Taylor? I've been listening to him for thirty years and I'd never have guessed -- and yet there's a song on _New Moon Shine_ that quotes directly from \\"God's Own Drunk.\\")<br />If you're a Buckley fan, you'll enjoy Trager's book. If not . . . well, I don't really know how to explain to you who and what Lord Richard Buckley was. Was he an entertainer? A saint? A scoundrel? A bodhisattva? A con man? A raconteur? A shaman? A swindler? An evangelist? A shameless moocher? An artist? An agent of God? A prankster? A drunk?<br />Well, yeah.<br />Above all, His Lordship was a sweet cat who blew a solid ace lick, and the way to meet him -- really the only way -- is to hear him. The book includes a CD with lots of good stuff on it, including several of His Lordship's raps and snippets from an interview with Studs Terkel. If you want to buy (or already own) the CD _His Royal Hipness_ (which is a re-release of _The Best of Lord Buckley_ and, if I'm not mistaken, the only Buckley CD currently available), don't worry about redundancy: the only overlap is in the two selections \\"The Nazz\\" and \\"People,\\" and even these are different recordings.<br />Also worthy of mention: a very thorough discography and bibliography, and a selection of hard-to-find photographs.<br />I'm surprised by other readers' comments about poor copyediting/proofreading. Sure, I spotted a handful of typos, misspellings, and such, but I didn't think it was an unusually high number. Most of them, unsurprisingly, are in the transcriptions of the oral interviews -- references to e.g. \\"Tom Leherer [sic]\\" and \\"Betty [sic] Davis\\" and that sort of thing. (Also, readers who know what \\"erstwhile\\" means will be amused at one or two points, notably the introductory remarks on former Grateful Dead keyboardist Tom Constanten.)<br />And I don't think the format looks \\"pasted together\\" at all; on the contrary, I think Trager has done a marvelous job combing through many, many hours of interviews and putting the bits into coherent order.<br />On the other hand, I have to admit that there are a few things that could have been better handled. For example, there are many references to Buckley's \\"hat trick\\" during the first portion of the book, but we don't find out what the \\"hat trick\\" actually _was_ until something like page 182. At least a topical index would have been helpful here (though frankly it's not a job I'd have cared to tackle).<br />It would also have been nice if, in summarizing Lord Buckley's influence on the world of literature, Trager had thought to mention Spider Robinson, who works a Buckley reference into just about every science fiction novel he writes and who has probably done more than anyone else to keep Buckley's influence alive among SF fandom.<br />But it's always possible to pick on little omissions with a work like this. Trager has made a massively successful effort on a monumental task -- a task that, for him, is clearly something between a labor of love and a vision quest. God swing him.utting the bits into coherent order.<br />On the other hand, I have to admit that there are a few things that could have been better handled.

And if Williams's book is the hippie _Tao Te Ching_, this one is the Diamond Sutra.<br /><br />In this little volume of spiritual teachings originally published in 1976, Stephen Gaskin gets right to the heart of the matter: you can't understand God, you can't define God, you can't contain God, but you can _be_ God. The rest of the book is about embodying precisely this spiritual realization -- call it enlightenment, Christ Consciousness, the Holy Spirit, satori, or whatever.<br /><br />And one of the most amazing things about the book is how much crap there _isn't_ in it. Stephen does _not_ screw around; these are some of his best, tightest, most focused raps ever. (That's why I compared this book to the Diamond Sutra.)<br /><br />Sample quote: \\"Being spiritual does not mean to become as esoteric and as different as you possibly can, but to become like a solvent that can melt away the differences between people until only the essential thing is left. If we really understand what we're doing, we ought to get it on and find essential agreement with anybody\\" [p. 63]. And this \\"anybody\\" includes our \\"enemies,\\" whom -- according to Stephen -- we should love even while we're opposing their actions.<br /><br />If this sounds a lot like a well-known Sermon that a certain famous Jewish teacher is said to have delivered on a Mount some 2000 years ago . . . well, let's just say that's not an accident. In its way, this book is a commentary on that very Sermon.<br /><br />But Stephen's teachings are also close to the heart of every other spiritual tradition, and that's not an accident either. He's studied them all, and he's as comfortable explaining what it means to be a bodhisattva as he is expounding the Golden Rule.<br /><br />He's speaking from the common core of all these traditions, and he's reminding us of something we already know: it matters how we _be_. There are no passengers on this here starship, only crew members and stowaways; we're free only when we're responsible. So let's cut the crap and get busy getting telepathic.<br /><br />There's nothing in this that requires the reader to adopt a new religion, but on the other hand it doesn't leave a lot of wiggle room for not trying to live up to the one you've already got. Stephen is also (among other things) one of the founders of The Farm; this book will give you a good sense of why that's one of the very few hippie communes still in existence.<br /><br />As I said in my review of _Amazing Dope Tales_, listening to Stephen has the power to knock your mind loose from your brain. It's not just what he says, but also how he says it; you'll pick up a sort of spiritual contact high just from reading his raps. No matter what you think of the contents of this book, you'll be at least a slightly better person after you read it -- and you'll know it.<br /><br />Whatever you're doing on this page, you've come to the right place.

This one is something like a hippie _Tao Te Ching_, and (as another reviewer has noted) its focus is on the energy that some traditions call &quot;ch'i&quot;.<br />Paul Williams originally published this book in 1973 and it became an underground classic in pretty short order. Its title is intended to parallel Marx's _Das Kapital_; Williams's essential thesis is that just as capital replaced land in modern economies, so &quot;energy&quot; will replace capital. (I'm putting the word &quot;energy&quot; in quotation marks so that it won't be misunderstood as having something to do with, say, solar heating or wind electric power generation.)<br />Readers with a background in economics may find Williams unconvincing on this point if they don't see what he's really driving at.<br />For example, at one point he declares roundly that money and property are obsolete concepts. What he really means is that we're on the verge of transcending these concepts _as_ the concepts on which the economy is founded. But he doesn't mean we just won't use money or property any more, or that we'll do away with the concepts altogether; after all, we didn't just stop using land when we started using &quot;capital,&quot; did we?<br />The real, underlying point is that money and property can't be shared in the way that ideas and energy can be. If I give you some of my physical/material property, I have less myself; but if I share an idea with you, then we _both_ have it. (Which is, by the way, a powerful argument against legally enforceable patents, as distinguished from copyrights and other sorts of intellectual property.) Similarly, if I share my &quot;energy&quot; with you, I don't become less conscious or receive less of what I need; just the opposite.<br />For Williams, the spiritual laws governing &quot;energy&quot; are the true foundation on which the human economy is really based. Williams states these spiritual laws and fleshes out the book with lots of spiritual advice of the hippie-wisdom variety; you can look at the book's sample pages to get an idea of where Williams is coming from in this regard.<br />Again, Williams's essential thesis is that the role of these laws in the spiritual economy is about to become clear. Writing in 1973, he was convinced that a sea change in human consciousness was just around the corner and we were about to take the next step in planetary evolution.<br />Was he wrong? I don't think so, but this isn't the place for an extended discussion of the point. Suffice it to say here that the growth of the Internet and the recent development of intellectual property law, prosaic though these phenomena may seem to some, are also an indication that the economy is moving in exactly the direction Williams describes in this book.<br />At any rate, this book is a modern spiritual classic, a masterpiece of &quot;hippie spirituality,&quot; and a good exposition of perennial philosophy. It also, but less obviously, belongs to a sort of &quot;underground libertarian&quot; tradition that predates the '60s: the &quot;energy&quot; in this book is the same &quot;energy&quot; Isabel Paterson was writing about in _The God of the Machine_.<br />Williams's approach to spirituality also goes well with Mary Ruwart's _Healing Our World_, a book I strongly recommend to any libertarian hippies (and anyone else) who may be reading this review.ation on which the human economy is really based.

1525234:US	52474360	R2OO1O9PFJPZK7	0066238366	317996760	Jesus: What He Really Said and Did	Books	4	19	26	N	Y	Mitchell's Jesus for teens and young adults	One of the editorial reviews of this book says: \\"his plug for the self-help work of Byron Katie seems out of place and disingenuous as Mitchell wrote the introduction for her new book.\\" So let's clear that up right away: Stephen Mitchell is married to Byron Katie. His only \\"plug\\" for her work is a brief mention of some material available for free on her website, and it's offered as an alternative that some people find more helpful than the meditative techniques Mitchell is discussing at that point in the text. There's nothing disingenuous going on here.<br />Now on to the book itself.<br />If you've read Mitchell's _The Gospel According to Jesus_, there won't be many surprises for you here. This book is a stripped-down, somewhat simplified version of that one; the text is part new, part used. The style is intended to be accessible to teenagers and young adults.<br />Mitchell's translation of the \\"gospel\\" is included as well, and it's essentially the same text as before but with some rewriting (mostly paraphrasing). Mitchell admits in his 1991 book that he may have excluded some passages \\"whose light [he hadn't] been able to see,\\" so the reader may wonder whether he's added anything since that time. Well, not much -- two or three short parables, a paraphrase of a line from the Gospel of the Nazoreans, and a couple of excerpts from the epistle of James. (I think this latter is an excellent choice; I think well of James and there's good reason to think the text is based closely on Jesus's oral teachings.)<br />What's really new here is Mitchell's introduction, in which he tells us quite a bit about how he came to write a book about Jesus in the first place. This stuff will be of interest not only to the book's ostensible target readership but also to readers of his earlier Jesus book who want to know more about what motivated him. And among other things, he admits candidly that in selecting what he regards as the \\"authentic\\" sayings and acts of the historical Jesus, he's deliberately erring on the side of leaving things out rather than including too much.<br />Despite some disagreements with some of his interpretations (e.g. his downplaying of the political importance of Jesus's teachings), I really like the positive features of his 1991 other book; in fact it was instrumental in getting me re-interested in the world's most famous Jewish spiritual teacher. But in my review of that book (which see), I gave it only three stars because of its questionable scholarship and its attitude of \\"spiritual one-upmanship\\" toward believing Christians (of whom, for the record, I am not one, so I'm not speaking here out of personal pique). This new book gets four stars because so much of that stuff has been toned down or omitted altogether.<br />Oh, some of the problems are still there. The resurrection, for example, is still treated as a \\"legend\\" with no explanation about why it can't be regarded as historical. Sure, the gospels' post-resurrection stories can't be reconciled with one another (e.g. did the disciples return to the Galilee or remain in Jerusalem?), but that doesn't mean _nothing_ happened. Jesus's being in some way \\"raised\\" doesn't commit anyone to a Christian theological understanding of the event. And if all Mitchell means is that Jesus's corpse didn't just get up and start walking around again -- well, I don't think that's what Christians believe either.<br />And we're still suggesting that Jesus might have been illegitimate. For the record, folks: under Jewish law, _any_ child born in wedlock is \\"legitimate,\\" no matter who the biological father is. Sure, if people suspected that Joseph wasn't Jesus's father, there might well have been some unpleasant talk. But that wouldn't make him \\"illegitimate\\"; \\"mamzer\\" is not the same concept as \\"bastard,\\" and I (again) wish Mitchell had said so.<br />But this time around, Mitchell has enough sense not to present his book as suitable for \\"believers and nonbelievers\\" (as per the subtitle of his earlier book). In fact he expressly warns Christians that some of them may _not_ want to read this book, which is a nice change (and an indication of why I awarded him that additional star).<br />This new book is suitable for its intended audience as long as they (or their parents) know what they're getting. And as I said, it will also be of interest to readers who want a little more of the \\"backstory\\" for _The Gospel According to Jesus_. If you like Mitchell's work, this one is worth the investment.f his earlier book).

Reader, this is Stephen Gaskin; Stephen, this is Reader.<br />Stephen Gaskin is, among other things, one of the founders of The Farm (which is about the only big hippie commune that turns out to have been built to last) and an activist for cannabis legalization. He's usually billed as a \\"hippie spiritual teacher,\\" which means that listening to him has the power to knock your mind loose from your brain.<br />And that should clue you in that this book -- originally published in 1980 and republished here with a new foreword by Stephen and a new introduction by Spider Robinson -- is _not_, despite its title, about dope. Stephen himself will tell you that dope is just one means among others and that all of this stuff can be approached in other ways. As for dope itself, Alan Watts and Baba Ram Dass used to say that when you've gotten the message, you should hang up the phone.<br />If you're worried about the drugs, you should be aware that for the most part the only drugs involved here are cannabis and LSD (plus an occasional bit of peyote and one or two others). Moreover, the book includes lots of cautionary tales about bad trips. And it's not _at all_ about (what I regard as) the really dangerous drugs. (These distinctions are important, especially during today's indiscriminate \\"war on drugs.\\" Being \\"anti-drug\\" is roughly equivalent to being \\"pro-food.\\")<br />So what _is_ the book about? It's about consciousness and religion and getting telepathic, and it's about some things that happened during some of Stephen's trips that hipped him to all of that stuff. More prosaically, it's a transcription of some oral history about the late '60s as delivered in Stephen's unique voice.<br />You'll like Stephen. And I wasn't kidding when I said he can knock your mind loose from your brain.<br />The _way_ he tells his stories is as important as the stories themselves. You can read a couple of sample pages and see what I mean; the whole book is like that. He talks from inside the experiences he describes, and these transcriptions make them real for you too, just as if he were sitting there talking to you. He's also pretty self-critical in what he makes of these experiences; pay close attention to his opinions about how hallucinations work and in what sense(s) they may be \\"real.\\"<br />Anyway, when you read one of his amazing dope tales, you may find that you've picked up a contact high from Stephen and that you, too, can sometimes see the subconscious on people. If enough of us did this sort of vicarious tripping, it might help us to get telepathic even without taking dope ourselves. That would be a good thing, wouldn't it?<br />If (like me) you're also a Spider Robinson fan, you'll enjoy his short introduction, which deals with both the significance and the failures of hippie ideals. (Stephen has shown up, sometimes disguised, in several of Spider's books.) And vice versa: if you like this book, you'll probably enjoy Spider's fiction as well.like that.

Now that this paperback edition is back in print, I've bought a replacement copy and I'm glad I did.<br />Paradoxes are fascinating. You may not agree with Jorge Luis Borges when he speculates that paradoxes and antinomies are evidence that the &quot;undivided divinity within us&quot; has &quot;dreamt the world&quot; (although there is actually a pretty good case that something like this is so). But at any rate, a good paradox is -- to borrow a phrase that was not available when Poundstone wrote this book -- an &quot;incongruity in the structure of the Matrix,&quot; an indication that there's _something_ subtly wrong with our intellectual take on reality, whether or not we can agree on _what's_ wrong. (In general but with rare exceptions, there isn't any widespread agreement about exactly how to resolve any of the famous paradoxes, even the ancient ones credited to Zeno of Elea.)<br />William Poundstone's _Labyrinths of Reason_ is as good an introduction as I know to this entire area of philosophical thought. His exposition is clear and intelligible without sacrificing either accuracy or depth, and he tackles a very broad range of philosophical puzzles, from the problems of inductive logic to NP-completeness. Moreover, he's clearly fascinated by these puzzles and he infects the reader with that fascination. If you don't like Poundstone's book, then this entire subject probably isn't your cup of tea.<br />If you _do_ like Poundstone's book, you'll find it a window onto what may be a whole new world (if you haven't read other books on this subject before). It's a great way to introduce yourself to mind-bending problems at the foundations of several fields: philosophy, of course (especially epistemology), but also the theory of complexity and computability, artificial intelligence, and even some aspects of theology.<br />Depending which features interest you most, you might go on to Douglas Hofstadter's Pulitzer Prize-winning tour-de-force _Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid_, a magical mystery tour that is primarily intended as a defense of artificial intelligence. (Can machines be conscious? Yes, Hofstadter argues, because we are such machines ourselves.) Or you may prefer to start with his _Metamagical Themas_, part of which deals with the Prisoner's Dilemma. (Robert Axelrod's _The Evolution of Cooperation_ will be a good follow-up too.)<br />Or you might want to read another good introductory discussion with a somewhat different &quot;take&quot;; in that case you'll want to consider R.M. Sainsbury's _Paradoxes_, which is aimed at arousing philosophical interest in these problems. If you want to see an attempt at a general solution of the full spectrum of paradoxes, check out Nicholas Rescher's _Paradoxes: Their Roots, Range, and Resolution_.<br />Or you may want to move on to logic and logic puzzles. In that case Raymond Smullyan is your man. Find used copies of _What Is the Name of This Book?, _This Book Needs No Title_, and _5000 B.C._, and/or get a new copy of _The Tao Is Silent_. Or, if you want to dive into rigorous formal logic, try his _First-Order Logic_ and then _Godel's Incompleteness Theorems_. (You may want to read Graham Priest's _Logic: A Very Short Introduction_ first.)<br />Or if it's the philosophical-theological aspects of infinity that got your attention, try Rudy Rucker's _Infinity and the Mind_. Rucker also deals with, and tries to resolve, some of the paradoxes discussed by Poundstone (e.g. the Berry paradox, involving &quot;the smallest number not nameable in fewer than nineteen syllables,&quot; which is apparently an eighteen-syllable name for that very number).<br />Wherever you go next, if you're not already familiar with these subjects, you won't find a better introduction than Poundstone's book.

But in the end I can't give it more than three stars.<br /><br />There are two main reasons for this, both having to do with what William Dembski believes himself to be arguing.<br /><br />First: The news in this book is supposed to be Dembski's notion of \\"specified complexity.\\" This is made to sound much more innovative than it is, and few mathematicians are likely to be impressed by Dembski's alleged originality here. The idea is just that when we see patterns rather than apparent chaos, and we find that we can describe the pattern independently, we don't attribute the phenomenon in question to chance; we know there must be something more to it.<br /><br />But as an argument for \\"intelligent design,\\" this is an _ignoratio elenchi_. There's no evolutionist in the world who thinks complex biological structures developed by sheer chance, just as there's no cosmologist in the world who would propose _randomness_ as the sole alternative to divine creation as the origin of the cosmos. Every one of Dembski's ideological opponents would argue that \\"specified complexity\\" -- in pretty much any non-question-begging way Dembski wants to define it -- is _exactly_ what evolution-by-genetic-natural-selection produces, and Dembski hasn't even begun to show this to be false.<br /><br />So if there were anything new in Dembski's argument, it would have to be, not his notion of \\"specified complexity,\\" but his claim that order and information can't arise from chaos. But you'll look in vain for any argument to this effect.<br /><br />You'll also look in vain for any admission that scientists _always_ look for order and almost _never_ attribute it to \\"design.\\" Dembski's examples are chosen to suggest the opposite: we know that watches were made by watchmakers; we know (or would know) that patterned signals from outer space come from alien intelligences rather than from random bursts of cosmic rays. But we also know that, say, the circumference of a circle is _always_ pi times its diameter, and no scientist in the world would take this as conclusive evidence of \\"design\\" -- just of \\"intelligibility,\\" which even Dembski himself is (properly) careful to _distinguish_ from \\"design.\\"<br /><br />So when all is said and done, we still haven't got a way to distinguish the \\"specified complexity\\" that results from intelligent design from the \\"specified complexity\\" that results from simple intelligibility. (There _is_ a cosmological argument that intelligibility itself implies an underlying intelligence, but Dembski doesn't give it. See Hugo Meynell's _The Intelligible Universe_, which I favorably reviewed a long time ago.) Maybe _The Design Inference_ covers this stuff better than this book does; at any rate Dembski keeps referring us to that book for all the arguments he isn't going to bother offering in this one, making sure to let us know that it's all very technical. But I find this sort of thing tiresome and full of handwaving.<br /><br />Which brings us to the second problem, where Dembski's handwaving gets a whole lot worse. It's pretty disingenuous to claim that \\"intelligent design\\" isn't specifically Christian, and then write an entire book on the presumption that atheism and Christianity are the only two alternatives. Hasn't Dembski heard of any other theistic religions? (Hint: One of them starts with J, and Jesus himself was raised in it. And it believes the universe to be the work of an intelligent Creator just as surely as Dembski's religion does.)<br /><br />But somehow, when Dembski wants to indulge in tub-thumping Christian triumphalism, all those other versions of theism never bother making an appearance. This probably won't bother any Christian triumphalists among his readership, but it should bother anybody who takes seriously his claim that belief in \\"intelligent design\\" doesn't in and of itself commit anyone to Christianity.<br /><br />And boy, do the hands start waving when we learn that \\"Christ is the completion of science\\"! First we receive a fairly good exposition of the way the set of real numbers \\"completes\\" the set of rational numbers. (But even for this, the lay reader is referred in a footnote, not to a helpful introductory book, but to Walter Rudin's excellent but hardly elementary _Principles of Mathematical Analysis_. Really. How many lay readers are going to go look this one up, or get anything out of it if they do? If Dembski had wanted to be helpful and enlightening rather than impressive and technically forbidding, wasn't there some other more elementary source to which he could have referred?)<br /><br />And this is offered as an analogy for the way Christ completes science. The analogy is never explained, so Dembski's target audience will presumably just nod their heads. Readers with mathematical backgrounds, however, may have a different reaction. So may philosophers, who will probably recognize that one can perfectly well believe in the _logos_ without identifying it with \\"Christ.\\"<br /><br />In general, Dembski's philosophical sophistication is not great (yes, yes, I know he has a Ph.D. in the field). Here again, I think we're supposed to be impressed rather than enlightened, as when he makes a brief and general remark about naturalistic philosophers \\"like\\" John Searle and David Malet Armstrong, and then refers us in a footnote (in the _same_ footnote) to _The Construction of Social Reality_ and _Universals: An Opinionated Introduction_ without bothering to explain what _either_ philosopher argues in _either_ of these books (or anywhere else). Good thing I'd already read them; I'd never have learned anything about them from Dembski -- other than the fact that he knows their names, which is, I'm fairly sure, all he intended to show us.<br /><br />His scientific sophistication isn't exactly on display either. For a book that's supposed to provide a \\"bridge between science and theology,\\" there sure isn't much science in it. And if Dembski wants to show us how to distinguish \\"intelligent design\\" from simple order, he really, _really_ needs to get down to cases.<br /><br />He's also very dismissive of what he likes to call \\"enlightenment rationalism,\\" as distinguished, one presumes, from his own Christian rationalism. This sometimes lead to odd results, as when he smugly remarks in a footnote (regarding those silly rationalists and their desire for \\"neat, self-contained explanations\\")  that \\"Christ always destroys our neat categories.\\" Really? Like \\"Christian\\" vs. \\"non-Christian\\"? Or like \\"design\\" vs. \\"accident\\"?<br /><br />Yawn. I'm a theist myself, I'm generally very favorable to critiques of Darwinism (which, you understand, is not to say that I think they _succeed_, but that I think well-founded criticism is helpful to the scientific enterprise and useful in making sure the neo-Darwinian synthesis isn't applied outside of its proper scope), and I do think the cosmos is best understood philosophically as the work of the God of classical theism.

1658213:US	52474360	R6GG9VXCYCHVJ	0970112564	330818760	The Message That Comes From Everywhere: Exploring the Common Core of the World's Religions and Modern Science	Books	5	13	14	N	N	The common teaching of all traditions ancient and modern	Gary Beckwith noticed that, although there were a lot of books that dealt with the underlying thematic unity of the world's religions, there weren't any really good _introductory_ books on the subject. So he wrote one.<br />He did a nice job. His presentation is clear without being oversimplified, and he gets the point across without overstating it.<br />The central theme of the book is that God is One in a deep theological sense -- that, ultimately, reality itself consists of One Mind, omnipresent, all-pervading, describable as both \\"love\\" and \\"light,\\" and present in some special manner in the human soul. This message Beckwith finds not only in all the world's religions but also in modern science.<br />Beckwith himself was raised Jewish and picked up on this theme when he heard the Shema in synagogue one day (\\"Shema Yisrael, Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad,\\" or \\"Hear, Israel, Adonai our God, Adonai is one\\"). Somewhat alienated from his childhood faith, he'd been practicing meditation under the instruction of Lawrence LeShan's 1974 book _How to Meditate_ (an excellent book, by the way) -- and upon hearing the Shema in a new way, he began to wonder whether \\"God is One\\" referred to the \\"oneness\\" reached via meditation.<br />So he started checking around. And what he found was that, not only did Judaism teach this very \\"oneness,\\" but so did all the other religions he could find.<br />Perhaps surprisingly, he learned (mostly, it seems, through Fritjof Capra's _The Tao of Physics_) that modern science taught something remarkably similar. So there's a chapter here on science as well. The discoveries of the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Nag Hammadi library seem to shed some light on the nature of Near Eastern religion during the period when Judaism and Christianity split (and thereby demonstrate that this common message was once less deeply buried than it now is), so he devotes a chapter to these texts as well. A pair of closing chapters suggest that this common teaching can also be found in our everyday lives and that it tells us something about why we're here.<br />The whole presentation is well handled and filled with examples of \\"parallel\\" sayings from the various religions and wisdom traditions. And it will probably provide a helpful jolt to the reader who hasn't previously encountered the \\"message that comes from everywhere.\\"<br />And to his great credit, Beckwith doesn't try to insist that all religions are identical in every respect. First of all, it's only too obvious that they're not; Beckwith limits the commonality to a set of \\"core\\" teachings, not to every single aspect of every single religion. Moreover, he's careful to describe the parallels as similarities rather than identities -- and strictly speaking, every similarity that falls short of identity is also a difference. So in Beckwith's hands, the world's religions don't all ooze together into some sort of undifferentiated grey goo; each retains its own character and identity, ringing its own particular changes on the underlying message of unity.<br />That means it can be read by an adherent of any faith or none. And _that_ means it's well suited to Beckwith's overarching purpose: promoting peace by emphasizing the common message of religion and science. His hope is that, rather than insisting that one religion is right and all the others therefore just fancy ways of going to hell, we may be able to recognize with respect that there is a truth common to all religions.<br />This book is best read, I think, by someone to whom this common-core-of-religions stuff is fairly new (and of course that's Beckwith's purpose in writing it). Beckwith also includes a helpful bibliography full of suggestions for further reading. But as Beckwith himself will tell you, there won't be much new here for the reader who has already covered this ground. His primary aim is to spread the word, not to cement our understanding of it.<br />My own recommendations, for whatever they're worth: depending on your interests, you could follow up with Larry Dossey's _Recovering the Soul_, Huston Smith's _Forgotten Truth_, John Hick's _An Interpretation of Religion_, Aldous Huxley's _The Perennial Philosophy_, Alan Watts' _The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are_, Douglas Harding's _On Having No Head_, any of Stephen Mitchell's translations of the world's spiritual literature, or (for children) Etan Boritzer's _What Is God?_. (I've reviewed several of these.)<br />There are lots of others, of course, and many of them are more specific to certain religious traditions than the handful I suggested (for example, Rabbi David Aaron's _Seeing God_). But if you're new to this literature, you can feel safe starting with Beckwith's book; it's very well done.n your interests, you could follow up with Larry Dossey's _Recovering the Soul_, Huston Smith's _Forgotten Truth_, John Hick's _An Interpretation of Religion_, Aldous Huxley's _The Perennial Philosophy_, Alan Watts' _The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are_, Douglas Harding's _On Having No Head_, any of Stephen Mitchell's translations of the world's spiritual literature, or (for children) Etan Boritzer's _What Is God?_.

However controversial some of Bloom's other theses may be, there is much truth in his characterization of the Sage of Concord. Probably most of us have been influenced by Emerson, at least indirectly, in far more ways than we realize.<br />But reading Emerson directly is at once an enlightening and maddening experience: &quot;enlightening&quot; because Emerson was a philosopher in the best sense of the word -- a lover of wisdom -- and &quot;maddening&quot; because he was _not_ a philosopher in any _other_ sense of the word. He was stubbornly disinclined to argumentation or even systematic exposition; his essays read more like sermons than like philosophical arguments; he preferred to deliver himself of his oracular insights without, it seems, subjecting them either to the criticism of other minds or even to the rigors of critical self-reflection, on the view that Reason was an all but infallible source of insight into truth and its objects are known with the same immediacy with which we know that we are awake. (It is a curious view of reason which makes no allowances for improvement of one's understanding.)<br />As a result of this take-it-or-leave it approach, his writings are all too easy to misunderstand, and for this he must bear much of the blame. For example, his remarks on charity in &quot;Self-reliance&quot; have led some readers to suppose that he was opposed to charity altogether, whereas in truth he believed that we are each of us suited by talent and temperament to be &quot;charitable&quot; to a special class of persons for whom we are therefore _truly_ responsible. Then, too, his remark in the same essay on &quot;a foolish consistency&quot; has been infamously and endlessly misquoted -- but even in its proper context it invites misunderstanding by failing to pay sufficient attention to the non-foolish variety of consistency (which Emerson supposed would take care of itself more or less automatically). Here again, Emerson's account of Reason, in giving so much weight to intuition, leaves strangely little room for reflection.<br />But in my own opinion, at least, Emerson's insights are genuine, sometimes brilliant, and essentially right, and it would be a shame if the readers who needed him most were unable to profit from his writings merely because he had been needlessly obscure. It would be nice, then, to have from another writer the guidance that Emerson himself was unwilling or unable to provide.<br />As you've probably guessed by now, that's where Richard Geldard comes in.<br />In this volume (which is a revised edition of _The Esoteric Emerson_, so don't buy them both!) Geldard does a marvelous job of exposition. He knows his Emerson backwards and forwards, and he sets out the essential features of Emerson's thought in clear and orderly fashion, chapter by chapter.<br />His essential &quot;take&quot; on Emerson, as you can tell from his title, is that Emerson is best approached as a spiritual teacher. I think this is not only correct but even obviously so; yet it is surprising how few available critical studies of Emerson are actually written from this point of view. At any rate, Geldard's exposition will provide the reader of Emerson with a much-needed &quot;map&quot; of the territory traversed in his writings.<br />I suspect that Geldard's &quot;map&quot; will make Emerson available to many readers who might otherwise have found him unpalatable. Some readers may, for example, be put off by what seems to be Emerson's extraordinarily cavalier attitude toward tradition in favor of present experience.<br />But according to Geldard, Emerson's actual meaning was as follows: &quot;We have to break, lovingly, the vessels of our tradition in order to become one with the source of that tradition&quot; [p. 176]. Now, certainly there is a difference in emphasis here with the religious tradition in which Emerson was brought up. But surely this is not far from, say, the Christian doctrine that the scriptures are a closed book unless read &quot;in the Spirit.&quot; (Granted, Emerson had much more in common with the Quakers than with the Calvinists in what he made of this point. Nevertheless it is not alien to even the most theologically conservative Christianity.)<br />Not being a Christian myself, though, I am interested not primarily in reconciling Emerson with Christian theology but in simple exposition of his teaching. And Geldard excels in this regard: in ten straightforward chapters he sets out the essentials of Emerson's teaching and places it into the context of his life. Not bad for 177 pages of text.<br />There are one or two points on which I wish Geldard had done a _little_ bit more explaining (for example, on the difference between the meanings of &quot;idealism&quot; in its philosophical and its popular senses), since he does not seem to be presuming any prior acquaintance with philosophy on the part of his readers. But this is just nitpicking on my part. (Hey, I have my own favorite hobby horses too.)

Maybe you're one of the many people who slip off their shoes as soon as they get home. Maybe you even remember running around barefoot when you were a kid. If so, then you're already aware that going barefoot is mighty comfortable (and maybe even faintly subversive).<br />Did you also know that it provides a number of medical benefits? Well, it does; there are lots of chronic problems -- and not just foot problems -- that are caused in part by wearing shoes unnecessarily.<br />So have you ever tried barefoot hiking? If not, Richard Keith Frazine would like your attention.<br />In this altogether charming book, Frazine sets out the case not only for hiking barefoot but for avoiding shoes in general. Far from being unsanitary or gross, he holds, going barefoot is actually physically, mentally, and spiritually healthy.<br />Frazine invites the reader to explore not only the benefits of going barefoot but the sources of various attitudes _about_ going barefoot. Why, for example, are bare feet associated by some with poverty or bad manners and by others with freedom and tolerance? (I myself avoid shoes whenever possible and I'm occasionally surprised by people who think there's something rude or offensive about bare feet.) And he clears up myth after myth about the supposed dangers of going barefoot and its associations with negative feelings.<br />As for hiking itself, there's a lot of sound advice in here about how to do it safely (and a lot of correction of the misunderstanding that it isn't _possible_ to do it safely). And it's also fun to read; Frazine's prose style has a delightfully old-fashioned, New England-y air that reminds me a bit of Emerson and Thoreau.<br />A fine book all around, then -- a well-written volume of sound advice and arguments, devoted to a subject on which I agree with the author. Now _that's_ a treat.<br />Going barefoot: it's not just for hippies anymore.<br />(You can preview the text online if you know where to look...	2002-01-17

It's an excellent example of the sort of thing he does best: he &quot;listens&quot; his way into a traditional text or story, and then says what it &quot;wants&quot; to say in lucid, liquid English prose-poetry.<br />In this case his story is the traditional &quot;Condensed Version&quot; of the story of the princess and the frog prince. Mitchell has remarked somewhere that the characters in this old Grimm's fairy tale were crying out to be deepened -- and so his retelling of the story deepens them into, respectively, a self-possessed Tao-Te-Ching-quoting princess and a meditative but seriously lovestruck frog.<br />The tale itself is transformed into a parable of love and spiritual transformation -- or were Mitchell's insights already present in the original tale just waiting for someone to bring them out? (Does it even make sense to suggest that these meanings were &quot;in&quot; the story _rather than_ &quot;in&quot; Mitchell's elaboration of it?)<br />Be that as it may, Mitchell's interpretive rendering is as lovely and captivating as anything he's ever written. I won't spoil anything, but Mitchell reminds the reader very early on about a point we often forget about the original tale: the frog doesn't turn into a prince when the princess kisses him, but only when she hurls him into a wall.<br />(The lesson here is not, of course, that if you don't like your lover as he is, you should throw him really hard against a load-bearing structural member and hope he changes into something you like better! It's that real love requires an unwillingness to settle for less than each other's best, together with a complemetary willingness to undergo difficult-but-necessary transformations oneself. But you'd probably figured that out already.)<br />The tale is notable as much for its style as for its substance (if these two aspects of Mitchell's work can be clearly differentiated at all). The narrative is filled with little frame-breaking devices, excursions into spiritual insight (and sometimes into just plain fun), and small touches that add texture to the physical and &quot;historical&quot; background of the story. As the events in question take place in Renaissance-period France, Mitchell works in not only some fine detail about e.g. the exquisite trappings of the royal palace but also some gentle twitting of French culture.<br />The insights themselves are, as is usual with Mitchell, the narrative center of gravity. I won't spoil these either, but they come from sources as diverse (or are they?) as the _Tao Te Ching_ and Spinoza, Japanese haiku and Rainer Maria Rilke. The sources will be no surprise to any readers familiar with the rest of Mitchell's ever-growing oeuvre, but they're worked into the story remarkably well.<br />Oh, and if you like this, see whether you can find a used copy of Mitchell's 1990 book _Parabales and Portraits_. It's currently out of print, but it's excellent in general and in particular it contains a one-page prose poem entitled &quot;The Frog Prince&quot; with which the present work is thematically unified.e frame-breaking devices, excursions into spiritual insight (and sometimes into just plain fun), and small touches that add texture to the physical and &quot;historical&quot; background of the story.

It may be exactly what you want, or it may be just the opposite; there's usually not much room in between.<br />In the present case, Mitchell has done something that some readers might consider pretty hubristic and perhaps even sacrilegious: he has produced an edited version of Walt Whitman's great &quot;Song of Myself&quot; that corresponds to no published version whatsoever.<br />How? Well, he started with the original (1855) edition of the poem, and then considered _every single change_ Whitman ever made in the poem clear up to his death in 1892. If Mitchell thought the change improved the poem, he left it in; if not, not. The result, for obvious reasons, is a &quot;Song of Myself&quot; that Whitman himself never actually wrote.<br />That's _not_ necessarily a bad thing. I respect Mitchell's taste and judgment, and I happen to agree with him that some of Whitman's later alterations made the poem worse. In fact I think Mitchell's edition is extremely fine.<br />But some readers may be looking for a version of &quot;Song of Myself&quot; that reflects Whitman's taste and judgment rather than Mitchell's. So let the buyer be aware.<br />At any rate I share Mitchell's high estimation of this poem and I'm happy that he's published his edition of it. Whitman belongs with Emerson and Thoreau on a shortlist of great American sages; this single poem is a large part of the reason why.	2002-01-09

I really like Stephen Mitchell's work, but it's important to know what you're getting.<br />What you're ordinarily _not_ getting is a straight-up translation of the source text; you're getting Mitchell's attempt to render the source text into a fine English poem that expresses the spiritual insights he wants it to express. (Examples: his excellent interpretive renderings of the Psalms and the Tao Te Ching. They are excellent interpretive renderings; they are _not_ translations.)<br />Even when the translation _is_ straightforward, he tends to chop the text to bits and just keep the parts he agrees with. (Examples: his translation of the book of Genesis, which includes the entire text but relegates the &quot;spiritually suspect&quot; parts to an appendix, and his rendering of the book of Job, which includes some terrific translation but omits the speech of Elihu and the poem in praise of wisdom.)<br />And now he's done the Bhagavad Gita. Has he translated it, or has he interpretively rendered it?<br />Well, the first point to make is that he _has_ included the entire text and limited himself to offering commentary on the parts he doesn't agree with. (Incidentally, I tend to disagree with the same parts and I understand that there have been Hindu scholars who have at least raised the same questions that Mitchell does.) This point alone means that Mitchell's Gita is a landmark: he hasn't chopped up the text in order to leave out the &quot;spiritually inferior&quot; portions.<br />So how good is his translation? Well, Mitchell says his own Sanskrit is &quot;rudimentary,&quot; but that doesn't mean (as some reviewers seem to think) that he doesn't know any at all. (This is a bit different from his Tao Te Ching, in which he admits that he just doesn't read Chinese.) And this _is_ called a &quot;new translation&quot; rather than a &quot;new interpretation.&quot;<br />But I don't know any Sanskrit at all, so I've just done some short comparisons with other translations. Based on spot-checks against the versions of Barbara Stoller Miller and Juan Mascaro, it looks to me as though Mitchell has stayed pretty close to the source. This is of course not an expert opinion of any kind and I'm prepared to be corrected by anyone who knows better. (And it may not even be much of a test, as Miller's translation in particular was one of the handful Mitchell consulted in preparing his own.)<br />Either way, what Mitchell is up to here is what he's up to nearly everywhere: he uses the traditional text as a medium to convey his own spiritual insights. And it's pretty clear from the get-go that he regards Lao-Tzu (i.e., _his_ Lao-Tzu) as spiritually superior to the author(s) of the Gita. Some readers may well agree with this evaluation (and I may be one of them; you guess). But all readers should be aware that Mitchell isn't trying to present a reverent discussion of the teachings of the Gita; he's sifting through it to see what parts of it measure up to his own Buddhist-Taoist-Jewish insights.<br />I am _not_ criticizing this enterprise; far from it. I tend to agree with many of Mitchell's insights, I really really really enjoy his poetic renderings, and on the whole I even admire his chutzpah (although in other books I've seen reason to criticize some of his scholarship). And in the present work he does, for example, raise (and to some extent answer) deep questions about the limits of nonviolence.<br />But, y'know, caveat emptor and all that. If you buy this book, buy it as Stephen Mitchell's work, not as an introduction to Hinduism through one of its central sacred texts. It's not really fair to describe this as a &quot;boutique&quot; Gita, but on the other hand it _is_ primarily a vehicle for Mitchell himself. I think that, like all of Mitchell's stuff, it's well worth reading and owning, but it depends on what you're looking for.ed on spot-checks against the versions of Barbara Stoller Miller and Juan Mascaro, it looks to me as though Mitchell has stayed pretty close to the source.

1703802:US	52474360	R2FC7A09YAQOCM	0520054601	751883435	The Case for Animal Rights	Books	5	54	62	N	Y	Beats the heck out of Peter Singer	As I suggested long ago in my review of Peter Singer's _Animal Liberation_, while I applaud Singer for pointing out numerous ways in which our treatment of animals could be improved, I don't find his \\"utilitarian\\" ethical arguments very persuasive.<br /><br />But Tom Regan's now-classic book -- this one -- is a different story. This is a tour-de-force of ethical argumentation that makes the titular case about as well as it's ever going to be made. Regan doesn't simplify any issues and he's very much alive to fine ethical nuances. And he sets out his case with both rigor and vigor.<br /><br />Probably most of us won't have any problem agreeing that at least some nonhuman animals are conscious, but there _have_ been people who have denied it (most famously, Rene Descartes). So for completeness, Regan begins with a careful discussion of the question. Avoiding simplistic answers and over-eager claims about research on e.g. animal language, he mounts a solid case that at least some nonhumans do possess consciousness.<br /><br />(Some of his arguments are a bit weaker than he thinks they are, although I still agree with his conclusions. For example, he argues that possession of language skills can't be an indicator of consciousness because human infants are presumably conscious before they acquire a language; how else, indeed, would they acquire it? But this shows only that _present_ possession of linguistic ability isn't a necessary condition of consciousness; it doesn't show that the ability to _learn_ a language isn't such a condition. As I said, though, I agree with his conclusion; I'm merely criticizing the way he gets to it.)<br /><br />The remainder of the book is a wide-ranging discussion, not just of animal rights, but of ethics generally. Even aside from Regan's nominal topic, the volume could serve as a fine introduction to ethical thought in general. (Among its many highlights: a short refutation of Jan Narveson's \\"rational egoism\\" that could double as a refutation of Ayn Rand's even sillier version.)<br /><br />In the end, what this gets us is a careful case for regarding mammalian animals which are at least a year old as possessors of \\"rights.\\" (Regan also argues that for other reasons, we could and should want to extend \\"rights\\" to other animals; he has limited his discussion to mammals in order to keep to what he takes to be a fairly clear-cut case.) These \\"rights\\" do not, he holds, trump every other ethical consideration under the sun; in particular, in emergency situations in which either (say) a human being or a dog (or a million dogs) must be killed, we should kill the dog (or dogs) every time. These \\"rights\\" are _prima facie_ moral claims -- strong, but not indefeasible.<br /><br />What I think Regan has successfully shown is that living beings don't have to be moral _agents_ in order to count in our moral deliberations. And with most of what he says on this subject, I heartily agree; in particular I think he has made just the right distinction between moral agents and moral patients, and correctly argued that moral patients have _some_ sort of \\"right\\" to consideration.<br /><br />I cannot, however, follow him _quite_ all the way to his conclusions -- for example, that we are morally obliged to be vegetarian and to refrain from using animals in all scientific research. Mind you, I've been a vegetarian myself and I think there _are_ good reasons for avoiding meat; I just don't think they're morally conclusive. I agree completely that many current practices are inhumane, and I also agree with a point Regan argues repeatedly: that moral limitations on what we can do with animals do _not_, as such, interfere with the operation of the free market. But I'm still not altogether sold.<br /><br />(The problem -- to put it briefly and inadequately -- is that I think Regan assigns too much to moral _patients_ in the way of \\"rights.\\" I'm not persuaded that in order to have a \\"right,\\" it's enough that someone else could makea moral claim on your behalf. In other words, I disagree with Regan's contention that moral agents and moral patients are entitled to exactly the _same_ sorts of moral consideration.)<br /><br />I don't, however, mind admitting that Regan has changed my mind on some points and may yet change my mind on others. If I ever _do_ change my mind on this last point, he will be in part responsible.<br /><br />And at any rate I highly recommend this volume to any readers interested in the topic of animal rights. Moral reasoning doesn't get any better than this.egan's contention that moral agents and moral patients are entitled to exactly the _same_ sorts of moral consideration.)

But they are very, very good; the best of them -- and all of the best are included in the present volume, along with the second-stringers -- will draw you in, rip you apart, fix you up better than before, and then turn you loose to get on with your life. The later Callahan (and para-Callahan) _novels_ are okay too, but the original short stories are like the first twenty-four Holmes tales by Conan Doyle: the later stuff just couldn't touch them. The _very_ best of them (most of which make up most of the first volume) are pure magic.<br />This collection (the title of which is spelled correctly) assembles all of the original three books, with the exception of the non-Callahan material from _Time Travelers Strictly Cash_. It also incorporates some other neat features, like the 1976 introduction by Ben Bova, a Callahan bibliography, and some additional stuff by Spider (including the Callahan &quot;short story&quot; that was published on the Internet a few years ago).<br />The stuff has held up mighty well. I usually recommend that newcomers to Robinson start with _Mindkiller_ and _Time Pressure_ (available in the combo volume _Deathkiller_), but you could start here instead if you like. The important thing is to start _somewhere_; Robinson's fiction, profoundly hopeful without being even remotely Pollyanna-ish, is almost a multivolume primer on the difficult art of nonviolent conflict resolution.	2001-12-23

I think this is probably his finest fiction.<br /><br />Nor is that an accident, as it was written at about the same time as _Infinity and the Mind_ and deals with the same primary theme: the soul's quest for God, the Absolutely Infinite. And Rucker's is my kind of mysticism.<br /><br />For this novel is about a mathematician who went to college to dodge the draft and winds up working in set theory in an attempt to (as Lord Buckley would have put it) dig infinity. At one time, Rucker himself was a mathematician who was supposed to be working on Georg Cantor's Continuum Problem while stuck teaching at a college in upstate New York; the novel's protagonist, Felix Rayman, is closely modeled on Rucker in this and other respects. (Some of the other characters are modeled on real and fictional people as well: for example, \\"Franx,\\" the giant cockroach, is modeled on Franz Kafka -- author of \\"Metamorphosis,\\" in which Gregor Samsa finds himself turned into a giant cockroach -- and \\"Donald Duck\\" is modeled on Donald Duck.) In fact, the original subtitle of the novel was \\"What Is Cantor's Continuum Problem?\\" -- which is, incidentally, to determine what order of infinity the points in space make up.<br /><br />This is thus the first novel in Rucker's series of \\"transreal\\" novels -- \\"transrealism\\" being defined as somewhat metaphorical storytelling based pretty closely on the author's own experiences. In the present case, we're talking about mystical experiences, some drug-induced, some not. At any rate, Felix Rayman does indeed get to dig infinity -- and so does the reader, although those with _no_ mathematical background may dig infinity a little better if they read _Infinity and the Mind_ either before or after this one.<br /><br />Rucker writes in his introduction to the Princeton edition of _Infinity and the Mind_ that he must have settled his questions about God, because he stopped thinking about them. Here, in a short afterword, he confirms that he still accepts the premises on which _White Light_ is based, and adds that he has also adopted a new belief: that far from being merely an impersonal metaphysical abstraction, God can and will help human beings overcome our spiritual difficulties if we just ask. He also gives us a bit more information about the influences that shaped the novel.<br /><br />Also included in this new edition is a somewhat informative but mostly irritating foreword by John Shirley, who helpfully  expounds the novel's relationship to the ideals of the '60s but vastly overstates its relationship to cyberpunk. (Rucker's _Software_ and its sequels may be cyberpunk, but this one isn't.)<br /><br />But the main feature is still the story itself, which I happen to think is mind-blowingly cool.

Expanded from the novella &quot;Baby Is Three,&quot; which makes up the second of the novel's three parts, it tells the story of the evolution of _homo gestalt_ -- thereby introducing a &quot;group mind&quot; theme that is also taken up in the work of one of Sturgeon's biggest fans, Spider Robinson.<br />It is not, by the way, an accident that Spider is both a Sturgeon fan _and_ a more or less unreconstructed hippie. Some readers of this book may not know how profound an effect SF had on the ideals of the 1960s -- and may, for example, be surprised to learn that the introduction to _Baby Is Three_ (Volume 6 of Sturgeon's collected works) was written by none other than David Crosby. (Another volume -- the fifth, I think -- is introduced by Kurt Vonnegut, who based Kilgore Trout loosely on Sturgeon.)<br />But in fact this is one of two SF books you _must_ read if you want to understand what motivated (and still motivates) those ideals. The other is Robert Heinlein's _Stranger In A Strange Land_. It wouldn't be too much to describe the entire '60s &quot;counterculture&quot; phenomenon as an attempt to do some grokking and bleshing on an unprecedented scale.<br />For &quot;grokking,&quot; see the Heinlein book. &quot;Bleshing&quot; -- blending and meshing -- is what individual humans do when they make up a single &quot;gestalt&quot; being. They don't lose individuality; they just combine to make a whole greater than the separate sum of the parts. You know, like a '60s rock band . . . (My own favorite example is David Crosby's own _If I Could Only Remember My Name_, but his recent work with CPR bleshes pretty darn fine too.)<br />Anyway, for my money, this volume is one of Sturgeon's finest works (not that any of it was _bad_). If you like it, check out Crosby's aforementioned introduction to Volume 6, and you might also like Spider Robinson's _Time Pressure_ (now available only in the combo volume _Deathkiller_, which also includes _Mindkiller_, the book to which _Time Pressure_ was the first sequel).Deathkiller_, which also includes _Mindkiller_, the book to which _Time Pressure_ was the first sequel).	2001-12-22

So what I'm saying is, I spent the time constructively.<br />The other two are ones I'd already read, so never mind them.

I can't tell you much about the story without spoiling it, so I'll keep my remarks general.<br />The tale centers on an extremely intelligent twelve-year-old boy named Mike, who may remind the reader both of Thorby in Robert Heinlein's _Citizen of the Galaxy_ and of Horty in Theodore Sturgeon's _The Dreaming Jewels_. The homage is deliberate, of course.<br />The plot is delightful. Mike hides away in Dreamworld, a magical theme park of the near future created by one Thomas Immega (presumably a descendant or other relative of the roboticist Guy Immega to whom _Callahan's Key_ is dedicated). Dreamworld is inspired by Disneyland but has rides and other features based on the works of e.g. Heinlein and the Beatles.<br />Its major rival is the violent Thrillworld. (The contrast is typical Spider, and I mean that as a compliment. If _you_ could make there be magic in the world, which sort would you pick? Black magic or white? Thrills or dreams? The manic pursuit of pleasure or the quiet possession of joy?) Thrillworld is headed by the nasty Alonzo Haines, who would very much like to destroy Dreamworld.<br />Anyway, Mike disappears into Dreamworld and almost at once hooks up with Annie, a middle-aged midget who has been hiding there for a while herself. Pretty soon interesting things start to happen, and not just because of Alonzo Haines. And that's about all I can tell you without giving too much away.<br />I _can_ tell you that the tale is Robinson at his humane and witty best. As usual, he includes at least one scene that will give you the creeping horrids; not many writers do this with Robinson's skill, as it takes a very high degree of empathy to create psychological tension without relying on gimmicks. And the reader familiar with Robinson's other novels will recognize _some_ familiar themes.<br />In short, readers who like Robinson already will find this a very satisfying tale. And readers who aren't already familiar with his work could profitably start here.<br />I hope some readers _will_ start here -- or somewhere -- because I really like all of Robinson's fiction.

In the present volume, he provides something new: a thorough, beginning-to-end nuts-and-bolts overview of what's involved in making mediation your regular job. (So far as I know, the only book even remotely comparable is Mosten's own earlier &quot;complete&quot; volume on the practice of mediation.)<br />And since that's exactly what I'm interested in doing, I'm pleased to say that less than twenty-four hours after receiving the book, I'm _already_ a thousand per cent better informed about what it takes to build a career in mediation.<br />Mosten starts at the very beginning. After a short introduction explaining how he moved into mediation himself and found it more consonant with his core values than the ordinary practice of law, he puts his readers through a few chapters of self-analysis to help us determine whether mediation might be right for us, too. (And I'm happy to say that I'm now even more firmly convinced that I'm going into what is, for me, the right field.)<br />Then there's plenty of good advice about how to prepare for such a career, including the all-important question: should you go to law school? All of Mosten's discussions are finely nuanced, with carefully balanced summaries of the factors weighing on each side; the one about law school is especially so. (I'm currently in an evening law school program myself, at the tender age of 38, and I would certainly caution would-be mediators to consider carefully whether such a rigorous program is necessary to their practice. I wish Mosten had also addressed the separate question of what factors tell in favor of and against actually taking the bar exam, but since I plan to take it anyway, it's not a burning issue for me personally.)<br />There's also an excellent chapter on the sorts of job available to mediators -- in, e.g., government, nonprofit enterprises, and other areas. A private mediation practice is presented as one alternative among others, and Mosten doesn't pull any punches in his discussion of what's involved in running your own mediation business; he says to expect it to be tough for the first few years if you go that route.<br />The rest of the book is devoted to developing and marketing oneself as a mediator. I won't even try to summarize this wideranging and thorough discussion (especially since, so far, I've only skimmed it myself!). I'll just remark that, in general, this is a wonderfully well-written and highly readable work of expository prose, packed with solid advice and plenty of information from one of the world's most experienced mediators.<br />(The bibliographic references are also excellent, though I didn't notice any surprises; some, most, or all of them may already be in your home mediation library. But it's nice to have Mosten's specific recommendations, and he's caused me to shift some things around on my to-buy list.)<br />If you're remotely interested in a career in mediation, or even in working in the field part-time, you'll find _lots_ of useful information in this book. I recommend that you add it to your own to-buy list -- _very_ near the top.

1770791:US	52474360	R1HUZ0H9LF0K3F	0787954810	811842598	Resolving Conflicts at Work: A Complete Guide for Everyone on the Job	Books	5	14	16	N	Y	The spirituality of conflict	I like this book. Ken Cloke is good in general on the topic of transformative mediation, and this volume -- co-written with Joan Goldsmith -- does a fine job of offering transformative-mediation-based insights to the actual parties to conflict. (This isn't a guide for mediators; it's a guide for &quot;conflictees.&quot;)<br />Cloke and Goldsmith offer what they call eight &quot;paths&quot; toward transformation. I won't detail them here since you can read about them yourself with Amazon's nifty new &quot;Look Inside&quot; feature; what they have in common is that they offer the reader ways to think about and to approach conflict that may help to turn it into an opportunity for transformation. The background setting is officially the &quot;workplace,&quot; but the guidance is easily generalizable to other contexts.<br />Then, too, some readers may think the whole field of nonviolent/transformative conflict resolution is full of feelgood warmfuzziness, suitable only for tender-minded Joe and Jane Sensitive utopian escapists. But these authors repeatedly insist -- rightly, in my opinion -- that resolving conflicts is a _much_ more active process than avoiding them, much more demanding of real courage and tough-mindedness. (And they don't present their approach as a solution to _every_ conflict.)<br />The most important thing to know is that Cloke and Goldsmith treat conflict as a spiritual opportunity. They stop short of maintaining that conflicts are actually _provided_ to us in order to promote our spiritual growth; for that, the reader is referred to Mark Rosen's excellent and delightful _Thank You for Being Such a Pain_, which takes as its premise that difficulties are given to us by Providence. But Cloke and Goldsmith do the next best thing and offer lots of helpful advice on how to _treat_ conflicts as opportunities; as such, their book stands well on its own merits, and in my own view works even better as something of a companion to Rosen's.<br />A good book, then, well worth reading for its insights on workplace conflict and on conflict generally, on the opportunities conflict presents and how to take advantage of it as a means for personal transformation. And I personally recommend that readers who believe in a providential God take a look at Rosen's book too.<br />This book (and Cloke's work generally, along with some of the other conflict resolution/mediation literature) might also be of interest to another class of reader: libertarians and classical liberals who want to see people empowered to manage their own problems without government intervention.<br />I'm sometimes surprised at how little my fellow libs have to say about alternative dispute resolution; you'd think we freedom-lovin' folks would be all over this field by now, and yet too many of us seem to be satisfied with airy references to &quot;defense agencies&quot; and the threat of force as the first, last, and only disincentive to aggression. It doesn't seem to occur to many of our most public voices that personal transformation -- what my generation used to call &quot;raising consciousness&quot; -- is the (only) key to avoiding many conflicts in the first place.<br />At any rate Cloke and Goldsmith's book is a pretty good place to start for the libertarian reader interested in conflict resolution. (William Ury's _The Third Side_ is another nice companion volume, devoted precisely to the question of how people might possibly -- and do -- manage to resolve conflicts without the help of a centralized State.) If you liked Mary Ruwart's _Healing Our World_ (which see), you'll probably like this stuff too; Ruwart has a fine sense of the spirituality of liberty.<br />(On the other hand, followers of Ayn Rand will probably _hate_ this stuff. And now that I think about it, one of the most damning criticisms I could make of Rand's ethics, and her philosophy generally, is that it tends to strip people of _precisely_ those spiritual virtues that make peaceful conflictresolution possible.)resolution possible.)	2001-11-15

Inspired by Rothbard's _The Mystery of Banking_ and _The Case Against the Fed_, LoCascio seeks to provide the reader with an accessible, easily understood introduction to the sort of jiggery-pokery that currently goes on with our &quot;money.&quot;<br />His effort seems to me to be quite successful, though I may not be the best judge of how a reader completely new to the topic would respond to the book. The exposition is set out in clear and intelligible prose and laced with illustrative dialogues. And his proposals for reform are presented cautiously and with due regard for alternative proposals (LoCascio's own is to freeze the money supply at its current level).<br />The &quot;special privilege&quot; of the title is sixfold. Under current U.S. law, banks have six &quot;special privileges&quot; that grant them sweeping and pretty scary powers: the power to create money out of thin air (both by the Fed's initial creation of unbacked currency and through individual banks' pyramiding new money on top of it through the &quot;fractional reserve&quot; system); special protection of their assets (any bank whatsoever can be &quot;rescued&quot; whenever the Fed chooses to do so); liability protection (FDIC deposit guarantees that encourage banks to engage in rash speculation); bailout schemes (at taxpayer expense, of course); funny accounting (e.g. booking outstanding loans at their original value instead of at their current value); and secrecy (banks don't have to report certain information even to their stockholders, let alone to the public). Each of these topics gets a chapter-long workout, and LoCascio does a good job of making them clear.<br />Moreover, his discussion of how things got this way is based in large measure on Milton Friedman's/Anna Jacobson Schwartz's _Monetary History of the United States_, a fine work highly regarded even by non-monetarists (even some Austrians like it). I would have liked to see a reference to Ludwig von Mises in here somewhere, even if just a nod to his _Theory of Money and Credit_, but at any rate LoCascio has selected good sources.<br />Another feature worth noting is LoCascio's insistence that banks' special privileges are a _moral_ problem -- that lending out multiples of demand deposits is a kind of fraud. (This feature has its good and bad points; on the one hand, it's nice to see the ethical question raised, but on the other hand I'm not sure LoCascio adequately explains _why_ it's wrong.)<br />On the whole LoCascio's presentation is thorough and even gripping, and he has a knack for grabbing the reader with the most telling points up front: for example, that the purchasing power of the dollar in 1937 was just about what it had been in 1802, whereas today's dollar is by comparison worth about eight cents. This fact appears on page eight and sets the reader asking exactly the question loCascio wants to answer: how in the world did this _happen_?<br />LoCascio's hope is to help prevent a financial disaster by informing the ordinary citizen about these &quot;special privileges&quot; and their ill economic effects. One way of helping him to succeed in that aim is to read this book.o report certain information even to their stockholders, let alone to the public).

1807767:US	52474360	RODLV7BB8A1F	0963233629	539711272	Healing Our World: The Other Piece of the Puzzle	Books	5	22	22	N	Y	Why liberty is a win-win proposition	There are two books I recommend as introductions to libertarian thought. One of them is Murray Rothbard's _For A New Liberty_. This is the other.<br />Dr. Mary Ruwart's _Healing Our World_ is in some ways a better general introduction suitable for a broader audience, in large measure because it appeals to the better nature of everybody from conservative Christians to hippie mystics: she really _does_ mean, and quite rightly, that libertarian principles are the means for healing our world. Her essential point is that, _whatever_ our goals and beliefs, we can best serve them by honoring our neighbors' choices so long as they aren't threatening our lives or property. For when we do so, everybody wins; my gains aren't your losses, and there really is a common good at which we can both aim.<br />Moreover, Ruwart carefully and compassionately explains why the libertarian approach is a better way to bring about the (entirely legitimate) goals of the more modern sort of liberal: for example, improving the quality and availability of medical care (including alternative medicines), reducing pollution, saving the environment, and so forth. Readers of, say, the Objectivist/Randian literature might come away with the impression that concern for the well-being of persons other than oneself (let alone the &quot;environment&quot;!) is just incompatible with libertarianism. Ruwart argues that in fact libertarianism offers not only the best way to _promote_ such concern but the only viable way to put it into practice. (On this ground alone, there are probably lots of _libertarians_ who could profit from a close reading of Ruwart's book just to pick up its tone and tenor. Her example of tolerant understanding could lead more &quot;brittle&quot; thinkers to enter empathically into values that haven't exactly been common among libertarians.)<br />Lurking in the background of Ruwart's exposition is her clear sense of the &quot;market&quot; as simply voluntary human interaction within a framework of obligatory respect for others' well-being. This view should appeal even to readers who don't care for the term &quot;market&quot;; it might, for example, be attractive to various sorts of communitarian and others who worry about the reduction of social life to economic exchange. The essential point is that human society, community, is an organic network of interacting centers of voluntary activity, not a bureaucratic order that imposes mechanical top-down rules via statute or regulatory agency -- and that trying to turn it from the former into the latter is just a fancy way to destroy it.<br />Ruwart's outlook should delight everybody from Calvinists to Hayekians to Taoists. And there has never been a time at which it's been more important to get the word out on liberty. Get this book at once and pass out copies to your friends; Ruwart's libertarianism has something to say to people of every political and/or religious persuasion or none.<br />By the way, you can pre-read it online if you know where to look.

This combo volume includes what I think are two of his best: _Mindkiller_ and _Time Pressure_.<br />In general I highly recommend Robinson's work, both his own and his collaborations with his wife Jeanne (_Stardance_, _Starseed_, and _Starmind_ -- the first two of which are now collected in the single volume _The Star Dancers_). Among other things, he's got excellent musical taste and I happen to share some of his SF-hippie sensibilities. But mainly, even when I disagree with him, I think he does a nice job of treating important themes.<br />His Callahan's Bar stories are not my personal favorites among his works, but they do a nice job of stating his single most important theme: shared pain is diminished, shared joy is increased. Basically, in Robinson's world (as in our own), you've got two choices: you can turn yourself into a human ingrown toenail, dying in your own emotional-spiritual toxins and poisoning everyone around you while you go -- or you can open up your window a crack and let in some light and air.<br />In one way or another, most of his books (from _Telempath_ onwards) explore this theme -- what would happen if we could get into each other's skulls and we didn't have to be so _alone_ all the time? And in contrast to his mentor Robert Heinlein, he doesn't treat the &quot;group mind&quot; as something to be avoided; in his tales, you don't lose individuality but fulfill it by becoming an integral part of an &quot;oversoul.&quot; Optimistic without being naive about the unplumbable depths of human cruelty, his works are in large measure a study of the spirituality of conflict resuolution.<br />Oh, yes -- the present book. Well, _Mindkiller_ is a really cool story, bordering on cyberpunk, that treats a &quot;future&quot; (actually 1994 and 1999, which were &quot;future&quot; when he wrote it) in which junkies practice &quot;wireheading&quot; -- plugging themselves into sockets that directly stimulate their pleasure centers. I won't spoil the story by divulging details, but much of the plot concerns the crucially important difference between pleasure and joy and why the latter is preferable.<br />_Time Pressure_ is a prequel/sequel (which I didn't actually know when I originally read it in 1987, and you're not actually _supposed_ to know until well into the story, but the fact that it's in this volume sort of gives it away) in which the theme gets further developed and tied into the &quot;group mind&quot; stuff. Here again, I won't give away plot details. But I can tell you that Robinson draws heavily on his life in a Nova Scotia commune (for a couple years in the 1970s) and presents a marvelously warm and humane literary portrait of hippie life and ideals.<br />And that's about all I can tell you about the stories without ruining your pleasure in reading them for the first time. If you like them, also try _Lifehouse_, the third book in the series. Then get the _Stardance_ books, and grab _Telempath_ while it's in print again. Et cetera.<br />You might also want to check out his new one, _The Free Lunch_ -- but having not yet read it myself, I can't tell you anything about it.themselves into sockets that directly stimulate their pleasure centers.

Almost unnoticed and unmentioned is the fact that the terrorists succeeded in killing thousands using, apparently, no weapon more powerful than a box cutter.<br />A handful who are aware of this salient point are claiming that airline security was lax owing to &quot;market failure.&quot; This is supposed to relieve us of the responsibility to establish security by means that respect rights.<br />But Bruce Benson's _To Serve and Protect_ addressed all of this several years ago -- broadly and in principle, though of course with no explicit discussion of the proper security measures for airlines to implement. What Benson provides in this volume is a thorough defense of a superficially counterintuitive claim that becomes less and less counterintuitive as time goes on: the free and private market is better, _much_ better, at providing security and criminal justice than is the government.<br />That means that his book is, sadly, perhaps more timely now than when it was written. By a simple extrapolation of the arguments presented herein, the recent tragedies indicate, not that &quot;private&quot; security provisions put us at risk of &quot;market failures,&quot; but that a government monopoly on criminal justice costs lives.<br />Benson is also the author of the highly recommended _The Enterpise of Law_, which sets out probably the most thorough case to date that _law_ can exist without the institutions of a territorial State. This volume is in some ways a sequel, setting out a positive case as to how &quot;private&quot; criminal law works and why it is, consistently and in principle, superior to government regulation. (And allegations of &quot;market failure&quot; are specifically addressed.)<br />Check it out. The need for Benson's arguments has never been greater at any time since its publication.out.

The second edition of Jennifer Niederst's comprehensive reference on web design now takes account of HTML 4.01; the stuff on browsers takes account of Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 and Netscape 6.<br />And what else is there to say? Just like the first edition (but with a handful of additional topics and updates to the existing ones), this volume provides a thorough &quot;desktop quick reference&quot; on the entire spectrum of web design -- a general introduction to and overview of the Web itself; authoring using HTML, cascading style sheets, and server side includes; graphics (GIF, JPEG, and PNG formats, colors, and animation); multimedia (audio, video, Flash, Shockwave, and introductory Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language); and advanced topics like JavaScript, DHTML, XML, XHTML, WAP, and WML. The appendices still provide easily-thumbable tables of HTML elements, attributes, tags nobody officially likes anymore, proprietary (i.e., browser-specific) tags, a chart showing which browsers support which CSS features, and all the special characters you can use in HTML (you know, &amp;#these; &amp;#things;).<br />And you probably also already know who Jen Niederst is; if not, go read my review of her book _Learning Web Design_, which you should buy first anyway if you're new to the subject. Anyway, she's a terrific writer with intimate knowledge of all the little details you need to know in order to do web design effectively; guides just don't come any better.<br />You know all of this already if you have the first edition.

A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability	Books	5	12	13	N	Y	Funny _and_ useful	If you're interested in learning how to design a website, start with Jennifer Niederst's books (_Learning Web Design_ and then _Web Design in a Nutshell_). But if you know basic web design and you're interested in making an existing (or planned) website more usable, this is the first book you want.<br />For one thing, Steve Krug is funny. No kidding; you'll squirt coffee out of your nose on every page, at least if you're foolish enough not to put the cup down after page one.<br />For another, his usability principles are very straightforward, easily understood and remembered, and well illustrated by copious examples. Although this book will be most useful to people who actually design websites, it _could_ be read by pretty much anybody (including -- hint, hint -- the _bosses_ of people who actually design websites).<br />He's somewhat at odds with Jakob Nielsen on the question of usability testing, but that's okay. In the first place, such disagreement is healthy in a field where, really, nobody _knows_ anything with full certitude (even when people _say_ they do); and in the second place, Krug is telling us how to do usability testing on a shoestring, within real-world economic constraints. So I say: get Nielsen's _Designing Web Usability_ too, but get this one first.<br />Krug's book is well done all around. And if your boss happened to see it sitting on your desk, maybe even borrow it, the world of the Web might become just a wee bit more civilized.	2001-09-24

It's still about the only book that addresses the design of _information_, and it still does the job very well.<br />O'Reilly has become justifiably famous with its user-friendly technical volumes, but this one is a bit of a departure. There isn't anything in here about how to code anything; there are no handy lists of functions or commands for easy reference. What there is is a thorough, focused but wide-ranging discussion of the issues facing someone who wants to make electronic information usable and accessible via a website.<br />(That includes database design, by the way. There isn't all that much detail and it's in the context of making websites searchable, but there's good discussion of e.g. controlled-vocabulary terms and how users actually look for information.)<br />The overall approach is refreshingly big-picture: the authors emphasize, for example, navigation _systems_ and labelling _systems_ (rather than just &quot;labels&quot;), and they devote an entire chapter to &quot;conceptual design.&quot; No wonder, three and a half years after its initial publication, it's still the standard reference work in a field that usually puts books out of date overnight.<br />And no wonder Jakob Nielsen thinks well enough of it to write the foreword. If you know who Nielsen is, you probably already have this book; but since none of the information on this page credits his contribution, it can't hurt to let readers know.<br />Ostensibly devoted to websites but generally applicable to any context in which electronic information has to be organized, this book should be somewhere on the shelf of every IT professional. If you like Steve Krug's _Don't Make Me Think!_ (as I do), you'll like this one too -- maybe better. (Krug's book is a good one to show your boss; this is a good one to read whether your boss sees it or not.)	2001-09-24

It's held up well.<br />Sanders, the author of several highly acclaimed works on Palestinian Judaism and of two absolutely magisterial works on the historical Jesus, here presents a highly condensed and accessible summary of Paul's thought. The reader should be aware that Sanders (a) locates Paul within the Judaism of his time and (b) has what most Christians (I'm not Christian myself) would call an extremely &quot;liberal&quot; approach to New Testament interpretation.<br />The book is already so short that summarizing it will require preternatural brevity. But here goes: for Sanders, Paul has an answer (Jesus's death and resurrection) to which he doesn't know the question, and his writings are an attempt not only to pass along the answer but to figure out just what that question is.<br />This little book is a nice introduction both to Sanders's thought on Paul and, for that matter, to Sanders himself. He's a master of expository prose style, reasonable almost to a fault, and a genuinely towering figure in modern New Testament scholarship; if you find that you like him, you'll want to check out his other books. I especially recommend _Jesus and Judaism_, _The Historical Figure of Jesus_, and _Studying the Synoptic Gospels_ (which he co-wrote with his wife, Margaret Davies -- who, incidentally, is the daughter of famed New Testament scholar W.D.

And in good traditional fashion (very much in accordance with the teachings of the Musar movement), he insists that there is no easy &quot;technique&quot; for learning to become a better parent; the thing to do is to work on becoming a better _person_.<br />So without presuming to present an exhaustive treatise, he takes the reader on a guided tour/overview of the traditional Jewish approach to parenthood: don't yell or spank, set an example. And -- as such a subject requires -- R. Kelemen makes his case with about twenty parts compassion for each part of stern correction.<br />But that stern correction is there, and this full-of-heart book also has a backbone of steel. In his closing chapter, for example, he takes on a topic that might at first glance seem out of place in a book on a three-thousand-year religious tradition: the hazards of television.<br />It's actually not out of place at all; as R. Kelemen reminds us, a group of very traditional Jewish scholars reported on these hazards some thirty years ago, and they are (or should be) of direct concern to parents everywhere. The entire approach is very much in the spirit of traditional strictures to watch what one allows into one's home and make sure it's spiritually uplifting.<br />TV, R. Kelemen argues, doesn't qualify -- and he cites the research to prove it. Even such apparently educational mainstays as &quot;Sesame Street&quot; have a grave downside, for example in their effects on attention span. Today, when kids are given Ritalin almost as readily as cold medicine, R. Kelemen deserves a close listen.<br />Some parents may disagree with some of R. Kelemen's conclusions. For that matter, I myself _might_ be willing to acknowledge that his case against TV looks too much at one side and not enough at the other. But on the other hand, it's surely important that the case be made as strongly as possible -- and I don't know of anywhere else it's made at all, let alone as thoroughly as it is here.<br />If you're a parent, get this book at once. There's plenty of excellent advice here, and it doesn't just apply to Jewish households.tes the research to prove it.

In fact I suspect it's probably Larry Dossey's best, although I haven't read _all_ of his books.<br /><br />What Dossey sets out to do in this volume is very straightforward: he wants to show the reader that there is reason to believe reality consists at bottom of a single &quot;nonlocal&quot; Mind that deserves to be identified as God. (By &quot;nonlocal&quot; he means &quot;unlimited by ordinary space and time.&quot;) That claim probably sounds a little strange to modern ears, but by the time Dossey is through, it will be a very closed-minded reader who still thinks there is nothing to be said for it.<br /><br />For Dossey is pretty thorough. He takes a largely empirical approach and invokes experimental results from a broad range of specializations --- medicine, psychology, biology, physics. And while his exposition isn't always as complete as I might like (he gets a lot of mileage, for example, out of Bell's theorem, but he never actually explains what it _is_), he still provides a well-rounded overview of all the stuff scientists have said that supports the nonlocality of mind. The reader will get short overviews of (the relevant portions of) the thought of, e.g., Erwin Schrodinger, Kurt Godel, Henry Margenau, David Bohm, and Rupert Sheldrake.<br /><br />By way of wrapping it all up, Dossey devotes his closing chapters to outlining just what all of this suggests about religion and theology. In some ways this is the real meat of his book and it's probably the strongest portion of his work. There will be few surprises in it for the reader who is already familiar with the philosophical/spiritual literature in this area, but Dossey is as good an introduction to it as any.<br /><br />What sets Dossey's book apart is not so much its conclusions -- which are properly tentative and at any rate common to pretty much the entire range of mystical/idealistic tradition and &quot;perennial philosophy&quot; -- but its broad overview of the support these conclusions receive from (some) science and scientists. Lots of other books focus in on this or that area (quantum theory, say, or parapsychology); Dossey tries to cover the whole spectrum. As a result his presentation is a little thin in some areas, but after eleven years this is still one of the very few books one can consult to get introductory information on _all_ of them.<br /><br />Good stuff.

Many readers of this page will already know who she is, but since this book is aimed at absolute beginners a short introduction may be in order.<br /><br />Originally a graphic designer, in 1993 Niederst became one of the very first web designers when she worked on the world's first commercial website (O'Reilly &amp; Associates' Global Network Navigator, which is no longer in publication but you can see samples of it on Niederst's own website if you want; write me for the URL). Since then she's been one of the best-known web designers around and she's written other books on the topic -- notably _Web Design in a Nutshell_, which I highly recommend you get as a followup to this one (but wait for the new second edition, due out in October 2001). Since Al Gore didn't even _invent_ the Internet until 1993, that makes Niederst the nearest thing there is to an &quot;old-timer&quot; in what is, after all, a pretty new profession.<br /><br />Niederst has said in interviews that this book is the one she wished she'd had to give her web-design students. It won't take you long to see why; it's painstakingly thorough and detailed, just the ticket for somebody who has never written a speck of HTML code before and is a little fuzzy on just what this &quot;Internet&quot; thing is.<br /><br />But it's also helpful to people at other stages of knowledge. The coverage (mostly HTML and graphics, with a little bit of appetite-whetting overview at the end about more advanced techniques like cascading style sheets, JavaScript, and XML) is so complete that if, like me, you learned this stuff on your own, it will fill in _lots_ of gaps in your education. (Over the last year or two I've gotten pretty proficient with text but I knew almost zilch about graphics until I read this book.) And even if you already know all this stuff cold, this book will probably still be handy as a reference and a source of helpful advice.<br /><br />Then, too, it's also a handy rough-and-ready guide to the sorts of application software you might want to acquire if you're getting seriously into web design. Niederst not only introduces the major players among authoring tools and graphics packages, but steps through her examples more than once to show you how they work in, e.g., Dreamweaver and GoLive.<br /><br />The style is breezy and chatty but with no loss of accuracy. You'll find out why Niederst thinks &quot;web design is cool&quot; and you'll learn some of &quot;Jen's pet peeves&quot; (e.g. spinning-globe graphics and rainbow bars), but you'll also get a thorough and accessible introduction to the nuts and bolts of web design.<br /><br />If you're just getting started on the creation of web pages, this is the book to use first. As I noted above, you'll probably also want to get Niederst's _Nutshell_ book as a sequel. After that, you'll be well qualified to decide what else you need./><br />Then, too, it's also a handy rough-and-ready guide to the sorts of application software you might want to acquire if you're getting seriously into web design.

Beyond that, it's hard to see what the fuss is about.<br /><br />First of all, and on the one hand, the book isn't the torrent of Machiavellian amorality you may have been led to believe. The author does go out of his way to make it _sound_ as though he's presenting you with sophisticated, in-the-know, just-between-us-hardheaded-realists amoral guidance. But as a matter of fact almost every bit of this advice _could_ have been presented without offense to the most traditional of morality.<br /><br />(For example, the law about letting other people do the work while you take the credit is made to sound worse than it really is. Sure, it admits of a \\"low\\" interpretation. But it's also, read slightly differently, a pretty apt description of what any good manager does.)<br /><br />Second, and on the other hand, the advice isn't _that_ good; it's merely well-presented. How it works will depend on who follows it; as the old Chinese proverb has it, when the wrong person does the right thing, it's the wrong thing.<br /><br />And that's why I have to deduct some stars from the book. For it seems to be designed to appeal precisely to the \\"wrong people.\\"<br /><br />Despite some sound advice, this book is aimed not at those who (like Socrates) share the power of reason with the gods, but at those who (like Ulysses) share it with the foxes. It seeks not to make you reasonable but to make you canny and cunning. And as a result, even when it advises you to do things that really do work out best for all concerned, it promotes an unhealthy sense that your best interests are at odds with nearly everyone else's. (And that the only reason for being helpful to other people is that it will advance your own cloak-and-dagger \\"career.\\")<br /><br />No matter how helpful some of the advice may be, it's hard to get around the book's rather pompous conceit that the reader is learning the perennial secrets of crafty courtiers everywhere. Even if only by its tone, this volume will tend to turn the reader into a lean and hungry Cassius rather than a confident and competent Caesar.<br /><br />In general the book does have some useful things to say about power and how to acquire and wield it. Unfortunately its approach will probably render the advice useless to the people who need it most. Readers who come to it for guidance will come away from it pretentiously self-absorbed if not downright narcissistic; the readers who can see through its Machiavellian posturing and recognize it for what it is will be the very readers who didn't need it in the first place.<br /><br />Recommended only to readers who _aren't_ unhealthily fascinated by Sun-Tzu, Balthasar Gracian, and Michael Korda.the reader into a lean and hungry Cassius rather than a confident and competent Caesar.

Here's a good place to start.<br /><br />As an [ahem] older law student, I recently signed up to participate in a mediation program through a local courthouse. As I looked around for helpful references, my eye fell naturally on this modern classic by Jennifer Beer. Continuously in print since 1982 and now in its third edition, it's probably _the_ book that did most to teach the American public how to \\"do\\" mediation.<br /><br />It's full of nuts-and-bolts advice on everything from what to say to where to put the chairs. And it's got something some other mediation books lack: a sense of the \\"spirituality\\" of mediation.<br /><br />For the techniques in this volume grew out of the Friends Conflict Resolution Programs (FCRP). And the Religious Society of Friends (\\"Quakers\\") is pretty good at conflict resolution.<br /><br />(It's those \\"meetings.\\" Some readers may know that in the early days of the United States, a half-century of so before the Emancipation Proclamation, the Friends unilaterally, voluntarily, and unanimously freed every last one of their slaves -- and paid them to boot, if I'm not mistaken. And anybody who has ever attended a Quaker meeting will understand why, even if they've never heard of John Woolman.)<br /><br />I've got quite a few Quakers in my family tree, so I'm pleased by this approach. But it's very understated and mostly behind the scenes, so the casual reader will notice only that the book has a certain mood or tone.<br /><br />What's really going on is that the mediation advice herein is implicitly predicated on the presumption that people are competent to settle their own disputes because each of them has \\"that of God\\" within. And the extraordinary sensitivity of the advice is based firmly on Quaker sensibilities: namely, respect for the individual conscience as the very voice of God, and a profound belief in the power of _listening_ both to others and to oneself.<br /><br />The result is a book of advice on mediation that looks an awful lot like a book on how to grasp the \\"sense of a meeting.\\" Even beyond the nuts and bolts, the \\"flavor\\" of the book will itself help the reader get a feel for what mediation is all about. That's a nice feature in a book on ADR, and it's no wonder Beer's book has been in print for so long.<br /><br />Allan Goodman's _Basic Skills for the New Mediator_ is a good companion volume, by the way. His book is more aimed at people who do mediation in \\"courtlike\\" settings, whereas Beer's is for pretty much any context (including workplace and family, both of which she discusses). The two together are a powerful combination of resources, arguably surpassing many more expensive books on the subject.<br /><br />And for a good history of the subject of ADR, see Linda Singer's _Settling Disputes_, which I've also reviewed.lf.

That quotation is from a colleague of Rabbi David Aaron, and it serves as a nice summary of R. Aaron's theological approach in this book. For the very first thing R. Aaron does is to \\"get rid of God\\" -- that is, of inadequate conceptions of God that interfere with actually perceiving the Divine presence.<br /><br />After laying some initial groundwork along these lines, R. Aaron presents a helpful intuitive/experiential introduction to the ten _sefirot_ -- the divine qualities or attributes by which God is, or may be, apprehended. His aim here is to provide not philosophical explanations but a series of \\"lenses\\" through which the reader can recognize God in experience. In consequence the discussions are filled with helpful examples and illustrations, and blessedly free of technical jargon. Each chapter also concludes with a short set of exercises.<br /><br />R. Aaron's book thus makes a nice introduction to Kabbalistic thought and \\"advaita\\" Jewish panentheism. I wish he had included an index and a bibliography, but since his intent is to promote experience rather than scholarship, the omissions are perhaps not very important.<br /><br />My real (but still minor) complaints are what they usually are about works like this one: such works tend to exaggerate the difference between idealistic panentheism and the more or less \\"classical\\" understanding of theism, and they tend to denigrate the importance and/or the effectiveness of rationality, intellect, reflective thought, and philosophy. R. Aaron's book is no exception, but his tendencies in this direction are quite mild. (My own view, for whatever it may be worth, is that rationality is precisely the respect in which we are made in the Divine image, and that if doing philosophy doesn't bring you to direct knowledge of God, you're doing it wrong. Then, too, I also reject the identification of \\"rationality\\" with left-brain abstract thought.)<br /><br />For more of this sort of thing, the reader might want to investigate the work of Rabbi Rami Shapiro; the opening chapters of his book _Minyan_, for example, contain an extremely helpful summary of panentheistic/nondualistic theology (although without much direct reference to Kabbalah).the opening chapters of his book _Minyan_, for example, contain an extremely helpful summary of panentheistic/nondualistic theology (although without much direct reference to Kabbalah).	2001-09-04

From the very bottom of the Roman social ladder, he taught and practiced a philosophy (originally due to Zeno) that came to be called &quot;Stoicism&quot; and influenced Roman society all the way to the very top: Roman soldiers used to carry copies of the _Enchiridion_ into battle, and the emperor Marcus Aurelius's famous &quot;Meditations&quot; consist mostly of his urging himself, apparently with limited success, to come closer to the Stoic ideal.<br /><br />The people who characterize Sharon Lebell's interpretive rendering as a &quot;self-help&quot; book have at least half a point; the written records of Epictetus's teachings (Epictetus didn't write them down himself) were self-help books in the first place.<br /><br />And fine ones they were. Oh, there are a few points at which Epictetus counsels heights of detachment suitable only for inhuman monsters, as when he suggests that we remember our wives and children are mortal so that we won't grieve when they die. But on the whole his teachings are firmly founded on the view that absolutely everything occurs by Providence, we are all of us children of God and citizens of the world with natural fellowship with one another, and we should assume responsibility for precisely those things which we can control -- namely, ourselves.<br /><br />This view, or something very close to it, has grounded religious and philosophical programs from the Torah to Alcoholics Anonymous, from Spinoza to the Musar movement, from antiquity to the very latest modernity (e.g., Mark Rosen's excellent _Thank You for Being Such a Pain_): when you face a challenge, use it to improve yourself; that's what it's for.<br /><br />And Epictetus's teachings were not assembled into books in order to provide academic employment for classical scholars. They were recorded because Epictetus himself wasn't going to be around to teach forever and it was believed to be important that his influence outlive him. His philosophy, after all, was supposed to be both practical and practiced.<br /><br />What Sharon Lebell has done in this excellent little volume is skim the very cream of Epictetus's philosophy and make it accessible to the modern reader. And it is worth remembering that Epictetus himself did not teach in writing but spoke directly to his listeners; his students would not have sat in the library poring over long crabbed volumes but sat in the open air listening to popularly accessible discourses.<br /><br />Lebell does interpret and modify, and she doesn't always say so. For example, she has Epictetus say at one point, &quot;Rationality isn't everything.&quot; This is by way of making the entirely unexceptionable point that there are things we're just not going to understand. But there is a good case to be made that, for Epictetus, rationality -- i.e., conformity to &quot;nature&quot; under the governance of reason -- was indeed &quot;everything,&quot; not merely a means to an end, as Lebell's rendering suggests, but both means _and_ end.<br /><br />But this is a piddling objection; Lebell's interpretations stay pretty close to the original, as any reader can verify by actually checking her text against a good translation of the sources. (I like the _Everyman_ edition, but I think it's out of print.)<br /><br />And before dismissing Lebell's interpretation as just another self-help book, we should ask ourselves how many _other_ &quot;self-help books&quot; include the advice, &quot;Let your reason be supreme&quot; [p. 62].t his influence outlive him.

That should tell you something about whether and how much I like it.<br /><br />If you don't quite understand what this book is about, much of it will read like a parade of Petr Beckmann's pet crotchets. (A partial list: he likes Archimedes, smart engineering, and political liberty; he despises Aristotle, the Roman Empire, and the Soviet Union.) Some readers may object to this sort of thing in what purports to be a history of mathematics. But I enjoy it, in part because I mostly agree with him and in part because it's not _just_ a parade of his pet crotchets.<br /><br />Beckmann is treating the history of pi as a microcosm of the history of science and human freedom. Mathematics isn't pursued in a vacuum, and one of Beckmann's overarching concerns in this volume is to argue that mathematical (and scientific) advances occur only when political liberty is realized.<br /><br />In support of this thesis he presents a marvelous array of blundering bureaucrats and asinine apparatchiks who couldn't engineer their way out of a wet paper sack. (You will, for example, find out exactly _which_ U.S. state legislature tried to round off the value of pi by law.) His remarks on Roman and other imperial &quot;engineering&quot; are sheerly delightful; his gibes at Aristotle tend to hit their mark although I think he fails to do the philosopher justice overall; his skewering of people who waste time calculating the value of pi to umpteen-bajillion decimal places is a joy to read.<br /><br />He also does a nice job presenting the positive history of pi -- that is, the genuine advances made when people like Gauss and Euler enjoyed sufficient intellectual liberty to do real mathematics without having to perform constant obeisance to self-important imperial stupidity. Contrary to what some reviewers have suggested, there _is_ a good deal of actual history of mathematics here.<br /><br />But don't buy the book if you don't like writers who present firmly-held opinions forcefully. Beckmann is an interesting fellow: he's an escapee from Communist Eastern Europe, he was for a time associated with Ayn Rand's silly &quot;Objectivist&quot; movement, and he has edited a journal of anti-Einsteinian physics. If you don't like your intellectual medicine in strong doses, a little bit of Beckmann will go a long way.<br /><br />As for me, I enjoy him thoroughly. And whether you like him or not, you shouldn't mistake him for a crank. His &quot;history of pi&quot; is an eloquent argument for freedom and against empire.book if you don't like writers who present firmly-held opinions forcefully.

So that they will be better economists.<br /><br />At least, that's what Daniel Hausman and Michael McPherson argue in this fine book. They also want to get moral philosophers interested in economic theory, but that's a secondary aim; this book is primarily directed at economists.<br /><br />Why is it that people who pride themselves on doing Wertfrei (value-free) positive economics are so often the first people to think they are in a position, even the best position, to settle large normative policy questions? Hausman and McPherson say it's because positive economics isn't really &quot;value-free&quot; at all.<br /><br />Why not? Well, according to our authors (and by the way, they're right), economists tend to identify human well-being with preference satisfaction, apparently in blissful unawareness that they are thereby committing themselves to a highly controversial ethical theory. Moreoever, those same economists tend to invoke a minimal, &quot;thin&quot; notion of _rationality_ that really means nothing more than efficient adjustment of means to ends in the satisfaction of preferences. The question whether some preferences may themselves be irrational tends not to be raised (by economists, that is; Hausman and McPherson are happy to name several moral philosophers -- e.g. Nagel and Parfit -- who have not only raised the question but answered it affirmatively).<br /><br />In consequence positive economics is not even close to &quot;value-free.&quot; By way of their implicit acceptance of well-being-as-preference-satisfaction together with their reliance on rationality-as-means/end-adjustment, economists have quite definitely and unambiguously imported a foundational ethical theory into their analysis. No wonder, then, that they feel uniquely qualified to pronounce on normative policy matters.<br /><br />And no wonder they're not _really_ thus qualified. For the facts are that the moral theory on which they are relying is highly questionable, and that in any case genuine experts don't espouse moral theories by accident. (I should add at once that there are plenty of positive economists who are aware of this problem even if they're not sure what to do about it; see e.g. Steven Landsburg's _The Armchair Economist_, which I have also reviewed.)<br /><br />Hausman and McPherson want to remedy this problem by getting economists interested in moral philosophy. So their book presents a short but thorough tour of the field, especially as it relates to economics. The reader is briefly and by turns introduced to utilitarianism and consequentialism; libertarianism; egalitarianism; and contractualism.<br /><br />Readers should be aware that this is _only_ a tour; Hausman and McPherson are highly critical of the moral theory underlying &quot;welfare economics,&quot; but they do not give their critical faculties much of a workout when discussing alternative theories. However, as an introduction to what the alternative theories actually say, their exposition is excellent and insightful. And they have a healthy sense that well-being is not simply a matter of &quot;preference-satisfaction,&quot; even if they are a little shy about saying what _else_ it is. (And as a libertarian myself, I am happy to say that their chapter on libertarian theory is one of the better accounts written by nonlibertarians.)<br /><br />A final portion of the book, in a nod to the ethical philosophers at whom the book is aimed secondarily, presents a little bit of economic theory for those who may not be familiar with it. This stuff comes a little late in the exposition, and for some reason the authors limit themselves to social choice theory and game theory. But these are good enough choices although far from exhaustive, and the authors do a nice job with them.<br /><br />Then an appendix deals with a fairly meaty issue: why should ethics matter to economics? This portion could probably have come earlier inthe book too, dealing as it does with the main point of the volume. But wherever it belongs, it raises and effectively answers a series of typical objections to the claim that economists should know something about moral philosophy.<br /><br />I should add in closing that their bibliographic information is just splendid, not only in economic theory but also in ethics.

For one thing, Polinsky gives a fuller discussion of the Coase Theorem; for another, Polinsky at least raises the question whether there is some sort of tradeoff between &quot;efficiency&quot; and &quot;equity.&quot; (The reader should be warned that neither of these terms means to an economist quite what it means to anyone else; &quot;equity&quot; in particular, as Polinsky himself is careful to explain, does not mean here what it means to a moral philosopher or a legal theorist.)<br /><br />As an introductory text, it's a good one; Polinsky tends to organize his presentation around well-chosen examples, and his discussion is usually pretty clear and accessible. Moreover, in apparent contrast to Miceli, he doesn't invoke much mathematics even of an elementary sort.<br /><br />But that mathematics is clearly lurking just beneath the surface of the words, and I caution the reader that Polinsky will be much easier to read if you've got some math background. (I don't mean graduate-level stuff; high-school algebra will likely be enough, and a little calculus will probably help.) This is a matter more of style than of substance; readers accustomed to dealing with mathematical texts will just be better equipped to worm their way into Polinsky's clear-but-dense prose and get his point.<br /><br />In coverage, Polinsky's book is pretty close to Cooter and Ulen's, but Cooter and Ulen are probably much more accessible to the typical beginning reader. Despite the absence of explicit mathematics, I'd personally rank Polinsky closer to Miceli in terms of difficulty; if Cooter and Ulen are &quot;elementary&quot; and Miceli is &quot;advanced,&quot; then Polinsky is &quot;high intermediate.&quot; Your mileage may vary.	2001-08-10

There are no real surprises here, but the novel is a nice tale of Holmes's possible involvement with the case.<br /><br />I'm not sure what to make of the novel's style, though. A short introductory chapter &quot;explains&quot; how Watson's notes on the case fell into the hands of someone apparently descended from or otherwise related to Watson's fellow medical practitioner Anstruther; we are to infer, I suppose, that the notes were written up into a novel by Hanna himself.<br /><br />Unfortunately that causes some problems for readers who are looking for an adventure of what Sir Arthur's son Adrian Conan Doyle called &quot;the old vintage.&quot; Among other things, Hanna's tale is told in the third person rather than in Watson's voice and from Watson's point of view; Doyle tried this in a couple of stories too, but I've never liked it. And in Hanna's case it means we get all sorts of authorial/editorial commentary on Holmes's state of mind and lots of florid adjectives describing his manner.<br /><br />In general, the narrative voice is not terribly close to what we would have gotten from the good doctor (despite the inclusion among the blurbs of glowing testimonials from such noted Sherlockian scholars as Ted Koppel and Charles Osgood, who seem to think Hanna has somehow channeled the very spirit of Doyle himself).<br /><br />But on the plus side, Hanna's characterizations ring fairly true. His Holmes and Watson mostly talk and act like the canonical Holmes and Watson; Holmes's detective work has the feel of authenticity. And the novel is well plotted, especially given the historical constraints within which the action must take place.<br /><br />So maybe I'm mistaken; perhaps this novel really _is_ assembled from some of Watson's recovered notes. Let the reader be the judge.	2001-08-10

But it was not generally thought that economic science had much of anything useful to say about the law generally.<br /><br />Then, in the early 1960s, Guido Calabresi and Ronald Coase published a couple of papers that a lot of people found pretty darned interesting.<br /><br />Richard Posner was one of those people. Within about a decade thereafter, he had written a massive treatise-textbook that attempted to apply (Chicago-school) economic insights to almost the entirety of the law, in part relying on Calabresi's insights on risk allocation and Coase's famous theorem about what happens in a world with no transaction costs.<br /><br />That treatise-textbook is now in its fifth edition, and you're looking at the Amazon page for it. It would be hard to name a more influential work in the field of law and economics -- and even today, as Posner himself will gladly tell you, although there are a few other _textbooks_ on the topic, there are still no other _treatises_.<br /><br />Posner's scope is breathtaking. Not content to limit himself to the usual array of legal topics (property, torts, contracts, criminal law, legal procedure, and so forth), he also manages to devote portions of his text to, e.g., sex and marriage, surrogate motherhood, prostitution, homosexuality, and a host of other controversial and/or marginal topics you don't typically encounter in an economics text.<br /><br />The typical reader will probably not find him altogether persuasive on these topics. In fact, if you're anything like me, you'll probably wind up shaking your head in sheer wonderment: how is it possible for someone to be so brilliantly incisive on one page and so infuriatingly obtuse on the next?<br /><br />But don't assume Posner is the one who's wrong. Don't misunderstand me; I think he _is_ sometimes the one who's wrong. But even then, his arguments are something to be reckoned with, not to be easily dismissed. (Nor is he _ever_ simply &quot;obtuse.&quot;)<br /><br />For the most part I think the book is a success in its more modest aim. In the fifth edition, Posner ends his opening chapter with a short reply to critics of the law and economics movement; with much of what he has to say here I can wholeheartedly agree. His work should, as he notes, be of _some_ interest to anyone who thinks Kaldor-Hicks efficiency/potential Pareto improvement plays any role whatsoever in setting policies. (I don't personally think it plays or should play much role at all, but I can agree with the point as Posner has stated it.) And Posner notes, quite unobjectionably, that the entire field should not be rejected merely because one does not accept the views of its most aggressive exponents.<br /><br />But make no mistake, Posner _is_ one of its most aggressive exponents, and the apparent modesty of his aims is somewhat disingenuous: he is not merely trying to find out what economics can say about the law but to tell us that it can say quite a lot indeed. And it is here that I find him ultimately unconvincing on a number of points.<br /><br />(To take one well-known example, I don't think Posner's discussion of the famous &quot;Hand formula&quot; captures what Judge Billings Learned Hand meant by it, and at any rate the formula is not as useful as Posner seems to think it is. There is some good discussion of the Hand formula by Richard Wright in _Philosophical Foundations of Tort Law_, and in general Posner has been roundly and in some respects successfully criticized by a wide range of scholars from Ronald Dworkin to Gary Schwartz.)<br /><br />But there is no getting around this massive work, and it absolutely cannot be lightly dismissed. On the contrary, the thing bristles with fine insights and obviously massive legal and economic erudition; most of it will repay close reading even for the reader who ends up disagreeing. If you have any interest in the field of law and economics, you really ought to read this book _sometime_.nterest in the field of law and economics, you really ought to read this book _sometime_.	2001-08-10

If you're looking for a good introduction to the field of law and economics intermediate between Mercuro/Medema's _Economics and the Law_ (low brainstrain) and Thomas Miceli's _Economics of the Law_ (high brainstrain), this one is a good choice.<br /><br />One of the things I especially like about Cooter and Ulen's approach is that they are careful _not_ to reduce law to economics (or vice versa, for that matter). Their claim is simply that law and economics have a lot to learn from one another. And this claim is hard to argue with, no matter what other criticisms I might make about some parts of the law-and-economics movement.<br /><br />For example, people who work with the law may tend to think of law as a means (solely) of securing justice, unaware that law also provides a complex structure of what economists would call &quot;incentives&quot; which promote what economists would call &quot;efficiency&quot;. On the other hand, economists may tend to take for granted the existence of such institutions as property rights and contracts, and the meaning of such terms as &quot;voluntary.&quot; These things are not as simple as they appear (as any first-year law student could tell you, although lots of &quot;pop libertarians&quot; probably couldn't), and legal scholarship has developed a lot of machinery for dealing with them.<br /><br />So this textbook, after a short opening chapter, devotes two not-overlong and altogether mainstream summary-and-overview chapters to, respectively, microeconomic theory and law. This means that a reader from either discipline can learn the basics of the other before proceeding to the meat of the analysis.<br /><br />Then the real work starts. Cooter and Ulen do a thorough job of presenting, in a readable and accessible manner, the basics of the economic analysis of the law of property, torts, contracts, legal procedure, crime, and all the other neat stuff on which the law-and-economics movement has based its reputation -- i.e., the application of economic theory to the study of law beyond the traditional bounds of, e.g., antitrust and other areas of law directly concerned with economics.<br /><br />It's designed to be eminently readable. Judgments like the one I'm about to render are notoriously subjective, but overall, the text strikes me as a good mix of clear expository prose, a well-chosen range of helpful examples, sound theory, and audience-appropriate mathematics (algebra and graphing). More advanced texts -- e.g. the aforementioned Miceli, and _Introduction to Law and Economics by A. Mitchell Polinsky -- are harder to read than this one unless you've got some math background. (Polinsky doesn't actually _use_ all that much math, but I think readers without some mathematical experience will find his book more difficult reading than this one.)<br /><br />References abound; every chapter closes with at least a handful of them. So the text also doubles as a bibliography and introduction to what is rapidly becoming a vast literature.<br /><br />If you're introducing yourself to the field, this book is a good investment. If you have a sufficiently strong background in mathematics, you _may_ be able to start with either Miceli or Polinsky (or both) and give this one a pass. But you'll miss a lot of helpful introductory discussion.<br /><br />Besides, this book has been something of a classic in the field ever since it was first published. If you have any interest in this field at all, you'll probably want to pick up a copy eventually.<br /><br />(It will probably _not_ help you much in law school, by the way, at least in the beginning. If you're just looking for an introduction to law and economics sufficient to get you started as a law student, I recommend Mercuro/Medema. You can go on to Posner and Landes and Shavell and Calabresi and the rest of them later.)utation -- i.e., the application of economic theory to the study of law beyond the traditional bounds of, e.g., antitrust and other areas of law directly concerned with economics.<br /><br />It's designed to be eminently readable.

(I have a very well-worn paperback copy.)<br /><br />Well, _Rat_ is back in print as of the present volume; it's one of the four stories that make up the &quot;quartet&quot; of the title. The others were added when a publisher approached Boyer about republishing _Rat_ and learned that he'd written three more Holmes stories.<br /><br />The volume doesn't even pretend to be written by Watson; in fact a rather silly preface allegedly written by Watson's great-grandson ascribes the tales to Boyer, taking the line that Holmes was fictional although Watson was not. (The preface also casts Sir Arthur in an unkind light; I believe it was written by the book's publisher.) So when I write, as I do here, of Boyer as the author, I won't be undermining any of the usual illusions.<br /><br />I don't think Boyer quite has the style down; he omits too many commas, he overuses italics and the ellipsis, and in his attempt to capture Watson's Victorian/Edwardian style he occasionally takes some quaint grammatical directions. (For example, at one point Watson says he &quot;was smote,&quot; rather than &quot;smitten,&quot; by a strong wind. Again, Holmes refers at one point to two earlier cases, &quot;the latter from which we scarcely escaped with our lives and reason.&quot; Of course it should be &quot;from the latter of which.&quot;) I say these things not merely because I am picayune -- although I am -- but because these little grammatical nuances are important in recreating the atmosphere and tone of the canonical tales.<br /><br />But Boyer can plot. And for _that_, we can forgive him a great many minor lapses.<br /><br />The highlight of the collection, undoubtedly, is _Rat_ itself. I won't summarize it here, since anyone who hasn't read it won't want me to spoil it and anyone who _has_ read it will simply want to know that it's included in this book.<br /><br />But the other three cases are pretty good too. Oh, the first two telegraph their solutions so completely that it would be impossible to miss them. The first -- the case of Zolnay the Aerialist -- gives itself away (in principle) fairly early on to pretty much any reader; as for the second -- the case of Bell Rock Light -- all Sherlockians/Holmesians, the moment they learn that it's set in a lighthouse, will recognize (although Boyer never mentions it) the unrecorded case on which the story is based and start watching for the (oops, can't say it) and his (oops, can't say that either). (Especially when they read the note left by the dead man.) But the details of the narrative more than make up for it; the stories are enjoyable all the same. &quot;Bell Rock Light,&quot; in particular, is notable for its fine (and surprisingly fascinating) description of lighthouse operation.<br /><br />The third piece -- the case of the Eyrie Cliff -- brings Holmes out of retirement during the First World War and reunites the sterling pair with Holmes's brother Mycroft. Among other things, we get to see a leather-clad Holmes whizzing along on a motorcycle with Watson in the sidecar.<br /><br />What will probably be of most interest to most readers, though, will be _Rat_ itself.

He also doesn't in the least mind naming names when it comes to egregious economic fallacies and the people who commit them: he keeps a &quot;Sound and Fury file&quot; consisting of economic gaffes from the op-ed pages and he devotes a chapter to exposing the culprits.<br /><br />His theme is easily stated, and he states it on the first page: the substance of economic science is that people respond to incentives. &quot;The rest,&quot; he writes in deliberate imitation of Rabbi Hillel, &quot;is commentary.&quot;<br /><br />Landsburg fills the rest of the book with such commentary. His witty and occasionally sarcastic exposition deals neatly with such topics as why recycling paper doesn't really save trees; why certain statistics are not reliable measures of the &quot;income gap&quot; between rich and poor; why the GNP is not an especially accurate measure of national wealth; why unemployment isn't necessarily a bad thing; why taxes _are_ a bad thing; why real economists don't care about what's &quot;good for the economy&quot; or endorse the pursuit of monetary profit apart from personal happiness; and lots of other points that will no doubt be profoundly irritating to people who just _know_ he _can't possibly_ be right.<br /><br />For example, Landsburg is delightfully allergic to the claims of the &quot;environmental&quot; movement and recognizes it quite clearly as a strongly moralistic religion. And contrary to the opinions of some not terribly careful readers, he does distinguish firmly between the actual harm caused by pollution and the psychic harm caused by (e.g.) the use of automobiles to people who object in principle to such technology.<br /><br />Interestingly, Landsburg recognizes a problem here for his own cost-benefit approach: if economic efficiency with regard to utilitarian/consequentialist goods and bads were really the whole story, he notes, he should care about _both_ the physical harm and the psychic harm, and yet he doesn't.<br /><br />Which leads neatly into the other notable feature of this volume: Landsburg is stunningly forthright about the nature -- and the limits -- of cost-benefit analysis. Unlike some economists who like to pretend such analysis is value-free and involves no commitment to any particular view of morality, Landsburg is clear that cost-benefit analysis is quite unambiguously committed to one particular moral outlook (which he characterizes and describes very neatly). And he is keenly aware of its limitations, though he is not at all confident about what should replace it.<br /><br />The problem, roughly, is this (the following characterization is mine, not his). As Landsburg notes several times, cost-benefit analysis does not regard &quot;theft&quot; as a cost, since it merely transfers existing stuff from one person to another; society is no worse off on net after the theft than before it. (Of course theft entails _further_ costs that _do_ leave society worse off, but that's not the point here.) Economics, as Landsburg describes it, looks only at _outcomes_ and not at how we got to them. And even at that, it looks only at one abstract feature of such outcomes, namely, how much &quot;good&quot; there is in the aggregate.<br /><br />And yet most of us would say that &quot;society&quot; _is_ somehow worse off after a theft -- that there is some sort of &quot;moral cost&quot; involved in the theft itself quite apart from its further consequences, and that it makes a difference whose &quot;good&quot; is rightfully achieved or acquired and whose is not. (Some of us might even say that there is something illegitimate in comparing the thief's gain to the victim's loss in the first place.) In ordinary moral discourse, it matters very much how we arrived at a given state of affairs.<br /><br />If so, then economic science has two choices (this is still my opinion, not his). (1) It can throw those &quot;moral costs&quot; into the mix and deal with &quot;rights and wrongs&quot; in the same way it deals with &quot;goods and bads.&quot; In that case, the total &quot;good&quot; will take account of the number and quality of right acts vs. wrong acts. (2) It can ignore those &quot;moral costs&quot; and continue as before.<br /><br />In either case, economic science _as Landsburg presents it_ is simply insufficient as a guide to policy decisions. (Landsburg tends to acknowledge this, maintaining only that cost-benefit analysis is an important _part_ of whatever it is we need to make policy decisions.) And it is certainly not -- as Landsburg also recognizes in a wonderfully forthright chapter -- sufficient as a guide to personal conduct.<br /><br />So this volume gets five stars even though Landsburg doesn't have much to say about what should supplement cost-benefit analysis. It's a terrific introduction to economic thinking genreally, and it's also a clear and frank recognition of the limitations of such thinking at least as practiced by many mainstream economists.llegitimate in comparing the thief's gain to the victim's loss in the first place.)

Arguably the finest current practitioner of the art is Denis O. Smith. At any rate, this book is not of that sort.<br /><br />The second is more or less typified by Ian Charnock's recent publication (in _The Elementary Cases of Shelock Holmes_) of several stories alleged to spring from the pen of Stamford, who had known Holmes as a young man and in fact introduced him to Watson. These are cases of primarily historical interest, moderate entertainment value, and debatable authenticity, wherein both the historical interest and the entertainment value depend heavily on maintaining the appearance of authenticity. A single false note, even one which might have been forgivable in the other sort of work or even explained away as a literary embellishment, can bring the whole thing crashing down.<br /><br />This book is of that sort. The stories themselves are better than those in Charnock's collection, but the reader looking solely for cries of \\"The game's afoot!\\" and adventures that recapture Doyle's magic will be disappointed.<br /><br />The conceit of the present volume is that there were certain cases which it would have been imprudent to publish during the lifetimes of Holmes, Watson, and others, and yet which Watson believed it worthwhile to set down for posterity. There are seven stories in this collection, all of them historical cases in which (this volume asserts) Holmes played a part not recorded by history but here described by Watson in documents written up and sealed in his old age.<br /><br />As a result, there are two difficulties for the reader seeking a transport of pure entertainment. First, the denouements are lacking; and second, the stories have few of the romantic \\"literary\\" flourishes Watson used in order to embellish and fictionalize his published accounts of Holmes's cases.<br /><br />These features would be excusable and even welcome if the manuscript in question were authentic. Unfortunately, however, there seem to me to be grave doubts on that score.<br /><br />One reason is the character and history of Professor James Moriarty, who appears in one tale which purports to be the true history of the adventures of the Final Problem, the Empty House, and Charles Augustus Milverton.<br /><br />In the published version of \\"The Final Problem,\\" Moriarty is presented as having made his international reputation at the age of twenty-one with a treatise on the binomial theorem. I have always taken this to be a product of Watson's fancy, as the binomial theorem was well known and understood long before Moriarty's time; it is hard to imagine what he could have had to say about it that would have garnered him such international fame.<br /><br />Yet in the present volume, Moriarty is not only credited again with this treatise (when there is no reason to add any embellishments) but also given credit for being the first man in two centuries to prove Fermat's Last Theorem as well as the first in a century to prove Goldbach's Conjecture. This is historical and mathematical nonsense -- historical, because had Moriarty proven either of these famous conjectures he would have been the first, not the second, to do so; and mathematical, because once a theorem is proven, it is proven. (Sometimes mathematicians discover alternative proofs by shorter routes or different methods. But if this is what Holmes had meant, he would presumably have said so; Watson presents him here as possessing mathematical expertise and familiarity with its literature.)<br /><br />Even more serious is that the end of this tale involves Watson in speculation that Holmes may have committed a dire act that, frankly, seems altogether out of character: the cold-blooded murder of a blackmailer threatening the reputation of the Crown. Granted, Holmes sometimes played fast and loose with the law in a good cause; granted, he sometimes went very far out on a limb in protection of queen/king and country. But this seems wrong.<br /><br />(It might also be argued that I am illicitly judging the \\"real\\" Holmes using the \\"fictionalized\\" Holmes as a standard -- that, indeed, Watson remade Holmes to some extent as a literary character, and did so in part by suppressing this act. I am unmoved; I shall believe this only on much stronger evidence than is presented here. And the authenticity of this manuscript is, after all, the very point at issue.)<br /><br />Moreover, I have another party on my side: Donald Thomas himself, in a short afterword, credits himself as the \\"author\\" in what would surely be a brazen claim were it not true.<br /><br />I cannot agree with the readers who think this book is not worth rereading. There are some fine tales here in which, for example, Holmes is involved (as his admirers have always known he was) in the creation and development of forensic science. While not as gripping as the original Holmes tales, they are surely not as uninteresting as some readers have suggested.<br /><br />But I am afraid I must withhold the judgment of authenticity. And under the scheme I set out in the first few paragraphs above, the \\"historical\\" tales are therefore not as interesting or as entertaining as they might have been.

I was so impressed by his _Bad Acts and Guilty Minds_ that I picked this one up almost at once. And it's just as good.<br /><br />This time around, Katz's plan is to deal with what he calls &quot;three related mysteries&quot;: the moral problem of &quot;avoision&quot; (i.e., what counts as morally bad evasion and what merely as legitimate avoidance); the moral nature of e.g. blackmail and insider trading (i.e., what, if anything, justifies our all but universal moral intuitions that these and other similar acts are genuinely wrong); and the problem of &quot;undeserved glory&quot; (and what's wrong with appropriating someone else's fame).<br /><br />I won't try to spell out Katz's examples and arguments under each of these headings, for I could not do so if I tried: his discussions are very well organized, but they pass from one subtopic to another with such rapidity and ease that I would have a hard time deciding just what to select. In general I shall say only that even where I disagree with him (as I sometimes do), his lively and provocative analysis is a sheer joy to read.<br /><br />His most prominent theme is also one of which I heartily approve. There are some lawyers, philosophers, and especially economists who think it is possible to be both a libertarian and a utilitarian. Katz forcefully disagrees (as do I). And one purpose of this volume is to hammer that point home.<br /><br />Himself apparently a libertarian, Katz argues repeatedly and at length that libertarianism requires a deontological foundation; utilitarianism is simply inadequate in every respect. Along the way he also mounts a striking _deontological_ defense of the role of the attorney (in helping clients to avoid malignant moral outrages by &quot;capitalizing on the deontological properties of legal rules,&quot; p. 131; you'll have to read the book to find out just what this means). And in one brief passage that one could wish were longer, he follows Amartya Sen to a striking conclusion: libertarianism is _also_ incompatible with complete freedom of contract. As in his earlier book, Katz's own outlook seems to be a sort of self-critical intuitionism along the lines of Judith Jarvis Thomson (whose &quot;trolley problem&quot; also gets a further workout here).<br /><br />I wrote in my review of Katz's previous book that it was all but unique. I am happy to say that isn't entirely so; this book is a lot like it. Highly recommended.martya Sen to a striking conclusion: libertarianism is _also_ incompatible with complete freedom of contract.

For that matter, many of them _aren't_ doing anything wrong; sometimes the problem is in ourselves only, and _we_ are the ones who are being &quot;difficult.&quot; (Everybody is difficult to somebody, says Rosen. And genuine evil, he thinks, is a rarity, although it does exist.)<br /><br />But however that may be, Rosen takes the view that there is a spiritual lesson for us hidden inside every one of our dealings with other people, that we will have to keep retaking the lesson until we learn it, and that ultimately the only way to guarantee that we can deal effectively with &quot;difficult&quot; people is to change ourselves in accordance with such lessons. And in chapter after chapter, he sets out exercises and questions that are intended to help us do just that.<br /><br />Rosen's approach is firmly grounded in Judaism (and clearly inspired by the Musar movement, especially R. Moshe Hayyim Luzzatto's _The Path of the Upright_, from which Rosen quotes on page one). But he is careful to present advice that carries over to other religions and spiritual traditions, and indeed to quote from representatives of those traditions -- or of none -- when they have something apropos to say. (I like his choices; his quotations range from Ambrose Bierce's &quot;Devil's Dictionary&quot; to Saint Jerome to Shakespeare to Groucho Marx to the Christian New Testament.) It is therefore suitable for readers of any religious persuasion, although for obvious reasons it will be most helpful to readers who believe in a providential God.<br /><br />The exercises themselves look helpful, and although I haven't tried many of them yet, they seem to comport very well with the sorts of things I already do. And aside from the exercises themselves, the book is full of terrific advice, in particular on the subject of taking an interest in other people's well-being without turning oneself into a doormat.<br /><br />If Rosen's approach were more widely adopted, it would not only grease the wheels of our relationships with those we find &quot;difficult,&quot; but also go some way toward restoring the idea of a &quot;common good&quot; to the place of respect it deserves. For Rosen's most essential advice is surely that we need not sacrifice our own interests in promoting those of others -- that, on the contrary, the most effective way of dealing with &quot;difficult&quot; people is to realize that we are on the same side if only we could see it.r readers of any religious persuasion, although for obvious reasons it will be most helpful to readers who believe in a providential God.<br /><br />The exercises themselves look helpful, and although I haven't tried many of them yet, they seem to comport very well with the sorts of things I already do.

I can't claim familiarity with the entire literature on near-death experiences, but Phillip Berman's work seems to me to stand out in several respects.<br /><br />First of all, a good deal of the book is devoted simply to describing NDEs as reported by the people who had them. In preparation for this volume, Berman interviewed literally hundreds of people -- and, moreover, scoured the world's religious literature looking for further historical examples. The results are not all included here; in fact he has probably had to leave out many more than he was able to put in. But his selections are well-chosen. (For example, he devotes an entire chapter to the neglected topic of &quot;hellish&quot; NDEs, notably the experience of one Howard Storm.) And he spends most of his time on straightforward reporting rather than rushing to conclusions.<br /><br />Second, he ties all this NDE stuff to mystical tradition and &quot;perennial philosophy&quot; (which he prefers to call &quot;eternal theology&quot;). Himself Jewish, Berman also competently discusses the mystical traditions of e.g. Christianity and Buddhism without attempting either to adjudicate among their theologies or to reduce these religions to their strictly mystical portions. His conclusion, in a nutshell, is that NDEs and mysticism teach us essentially the same things about the nature of God and reality.<br /><br />Third, his conclusions are presented with thoroughness and proper caution. Berman does not attempt to minimize or paper over the genuine differences among the various types of NDE and mystical experience; he does not proclaim that his work has &quot;finally proven&quot; something that was hitherto only suspected and that he has thereby settled all the important questions; he deals sensitively and compassionately with the losses of loved ones (including his own) without relying in any way on maudlin sentiment at the expense of empirical reportage and theological argumentation. Generally speaking, he knows the difference between conclusions and speculations, offering some of each and claiming for his work just what it deserves. This is a sober and responsible work of theology, not an extended piece of tabloid journalism.<br /><br />Fourth, his topic is precisely what his subtitle indicates: he is interested in what NDEs and mystical experiences _teach us_, not in telling us how to go about _having_ such experiences ourselves (nor even in urging the importance of having them). He has what I regard as a healthy sense (based firmly in all of the religious traditions with which he deals) that there is something unsound about seeking such experiences for oneself, and for that matter about (mis)taking the purpose of religion to be the bringing about of such experiences. This is, again, a work of theology, not a how-to handbook.<br /><br />This seems to me to be a standout work, then. Again, I do not claim to have read the whole NDE literature, but of the handful of books I _have_ read, this one is unique. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in these topics.lly speaking, he knows the difference between conclusions and speculations, offering some of each and claiming for his work just what it deserves.

We all know how this is supposed to work as applied to the usual exercise of eminent domain. But Epstein casts his net wide and argues that the takings clause applies to all sorts of things you never would have thought of -- welfare programs, rent control, jiggery-pokery with the national currency, you name it.<br /><br />The impact of the book is evident mainly through &quot;negative&quot; evidence. For example, some readers may recall that during the Clarence Thomas hearings, somebody asked Thomas if he believed the stuff in this book (as the Congresscritter in question clearly did not). I think Thomas managed to duck the question, but the point was made. And at any rate, it tells you something that somebody found it important to _ask_ the question in the first place.<br /><br />Then, too, my own property-law casebook remarks somewhere near the end that Epstein's views on &quot;takings&quot; have not been found convincing by too many people. Interesting that the book still finds it necessary to mention his work, then.<br /><br />So check it out. Sure, it's radical, and (let's admit it frankly) it's probably not a correct interpretation of the framers' intent. But if you're not a tax-and-spend Congresscritter, maybe you'll find it as pregnant and alluring a suggestion as I do. And it's one of Epstein's best books; I think he wrote it before he had completely converted to utilitarianism. You don't have to agree with it, but you should at least learn why Federalistas are afraid of it.	2001-07-16

That would be a mistake.<br /><br />In fact Dossey is highly critical of the \\"New Age\\" movement. And despite some overblown cover blurbs, he doesn't claim to have \\"proven\\" anything about the power of prayer in healing; he's making suggestions and exploring possibilities, not laying down law.<br /><br />Nor, for the most part, is his speculation wild or unfounded. His suggestions are founded on two things: empirical research that seems to show prayer is effective in promoting the biological growth of certain forms of life under controlled laboratory conditions, and the theological/philosophical view that reality is ultimately a single, universal, \\"nonlocal\\" Absolute Mind.<br /><br />However controversial these foundations might be, he presents his suggestions with proper caution. And he is especially careful to avoid falling into the New Age blame-the-patient trap; he is well aware that prayer doesn't always achieve the results we might like and that this isn't because somebody has done something to \\"choose\\" or \\"deserve\\" ill health.<br /><br />On the contrary, he has a healthy sense that prayer is really (though this language isn't quite his) for the purpose of adjusting us to the Divine Will rather than vice-versa. (Anthony de Mello tells a story somewhere about a man who said, \\"In your country it is regarded as a miracle when God does the will of a human being. In my country it is regarded as a miracle when a human being does the will of God.\\") On his view, the \\"power\\" of prayer is shown as much in our acceptance of our health limitations as in their elimination.<br /><br />There are a couple of places where Dossey threatens to wander off the deep end (e.g. his suggestion that prayer can change the past), and there's a little bit of language (e.g. \\"Era I, Era II, and Era III\\") that recalls bad 1970s self-help books. But I really have only one bone to pick with Dossey: he tends at times to overstate the difference between his views and those of traditional, \\"classical\\" theism.<br /><br />There is a tendency among those (of whom I am one, which is in part how I know this) who left their childhood religions in their early teens to assume, more or less unconsciously, that our understanding of such religion was complete at that time and none of its adherents understood any of the cool things we went on to discover for ourselves. It's hard to shake one's implicit belief that those hidebound \\"fundamentalists\\" couldn't _possibly_ have known any of this nifty \\"spirituality\\" stuff; \\"dogmatic\\" religion is, of course, the arch-enemy of \\"true\\" spirituality -- isn't it?<br /><br />Dossey has a very mild tendency in this direction. In consequence I suspect he will occasionally leave more traditional religious believers with the sense that they are being misunderstood, patronized, or both.<br /><br />But it doesn't happen very often, and it hardly happens at all in this book. On the whole, Dossey's approach tends to confirm rather than undermine the great theistic religions' view of prayer.the difference between his views and those of traditional, \\"classical\\" theism.<br /><br />There is a tendency among those (of whom I am one, which is in part how I know this) who left their childhood religions in their early teens to assume, more or less unconsciously, that our understanding of such religion was complete at that time and none of its adherents understood any of the cool things we went on to discover for ourselves.

On the contrary, says Leo Katz: hard cases _expose_ bad law and force us to correct it. The flaws in apparently sound principles aren't always obvious when we apply them only to easy cases.<br /><br />With this approach, Katz offers a book that is all but unique in the legal/philosophical literature, and one that should appeal to lawyers, law students, and nonlawyers alike. Bringing to bear a large quiverful of hypotheticals, thought experiments, and extreme cases (some real, some contrived, some purely fantastical), Katz puts common legal principles through their paces and shows us that our intuitions, while reliable in a general way, may not be as sound as they appear at first blush.<br /><br />Katz's own area of expertise is criminal law, but he may have done the book a mild disservice in its subtitle: as he is himself well aware, the &quot;conundrums&quot; with which he deals -- What is the difference between an act and an omission? What does it mean to do something &quot;intentionally&quot;? What does it mean to say that something is the legal &quot;cause&quot; of something else? -- bear on many areas of the law, including (for example) contracts, torts, and wills.<br /><br />They are also of general philosophical interest, of course, and Katz is himself a competent philosopher more or less in the &quot;analytic&quot; camp; indeed, his footnotes are as likely to cite Searle or Austin as to refer to a case. His discussions of e.g. tacit knowledge (a la Michael Polanyi) and judgment under uncertainty (a la the famous work of Kahneman and Tversky) are most gratifying and in each case will point the interested reader to a fascinating body of literature with which, probably, lawyers ought to be familiar. (For example, he does a nice job of tying the psychology of risk and uncertainty to the psychology of jury verdicts.)<br /><br />And he is one of few writers who make (what I regard as) sound use of thought-experiments, which in the wrong hands (say, Rawls's) are merely tools for confusing oneself and others. Another writer with the right hands is Judith Jarvis Thomson -- and sure enough, Katz cites her well-known &quot;Trolley Problem,&quot; for which see _Rights, Restitution and Risk_ and the additional discussion of the problem in _The Realm of Rights_. (By the way, Katz does not explicitly set out his own fundamental outlook but his overall approach to moral problems seems to be based on a sort of critical intuitionism not unlike Thomson's.)<br /><br />The resulting volume is a thoroughly enjoyable and stimulating read. Law students in particular may want to read it as early as possible, as Katz's use of hypos is much like what we encounter in law school and will probably do more to galvanize the reader into &quot;legal reasoning&quot; than any ten other books on the topic. But it's suitable for a general readership.<br /><br />It is also a fine corrective to the view that the law can be rendered clear and unambiguous by reliance on a handful of simple principles (e.g. by reducing all law to &quot;property rights&quot;). Katz is at pains to show -- I think successfully -- that no such program can hope to eliminate all vagueness or explicitly capture everything of intuitive relevance, and in at least one case (&quot;proximate cause&quot;) he presents an entirely new argument showing why this is so.<br /><br />Katz is also the author of _Ill-Gotten Gains_ and moreover has a nice essay in Dennis Patterson's _A Companion to Philosophy of Law and Legal Theory_, another volume which is highly recommended (especially to law students). Katz's readers might also be interested in Patterson's _Law and Truth_, which in a way is complementary and &quot;orthogonal&quot; to the present work: Patterson is concerned with what it means for a proposition of law to be true, and Katz has a good deal to say that is relevant to this question.rely tools for confusing oneself and others.

This is just false; plenty of major stars have spent entire careers without releasing an album as fine as _Numbers_, _Izitso_, and _Back to Earth_. (And I can't make myself give any of his work fewer than four stars.)<br /><br />But none of them are of the stratospheric quality of his finest three albums. He had two absolutely great albums -- _Tea for the Tillerman_ and _Teaser and the Firecat_ -- and _Mona Bone Jakon_ was mighty close. If you have those three, you have most of the &quot;very best of&quot; Cat Stevens already, never mind those other &quot;best of&quot; collections. (The rest of the best is on _Buddha and the Chocolate Box_ -- &quot;Oh, Very Young&quot; and &quot;Sun/C79.&quot;)<br /><br />Nevertheless, _Back to Earth_ is a _good_ album -- both on its own terms and as Cat's farewell to the life of the &quot;pop star.&quot; Most of his familiar themes are here -- children, father-son relationships, the beginnings and endings of romance -- and the music has, at times, something of the gentle touch we knew from his earlier work.<br /><br />I don't personally think there are any real standout tunes here; I like &quot;Just Another Night,&quot; I enjoy the hit &quot;Bad Brakes&quot; about as much as I enjoy &quot;Can't Keep It In&quot; (from _Catch Bull at Four_), and so forth, but there's no single tune that really grabs me. And I do think there are a couple of false steps (I can safely predict that I'm probably never going to care much for &quot;New York Times&quot;). But the album is much better crafted than you might think from what people sometimes say about it.<br /><br />All in all, it's a fitting final collection from a fine singer/songwriter. Speaking of which, here's a little history for the uninitiated:<br /><br />&quot;Cat Stevens&quot; was the stage name of Steven Georgiou, who was born in the U.K. in 1949 of a Cypriot father and a Swedish mother. Something of a musical prodigy, he released his first two albums well before he was twenty years old and was on his way to becoming a &quot;pop star.&quot; He then fell victim to a terrible case of tuberculosis. When he returned to singing and songwriting, he had taken a decidedly more reflective turn and found himself delivering absolutely beautiful stuff with no apparent commercial potential. That was fine with him; he was no longer particularly interested in commercial success. But, perhaps ironically, his delicate confessional songs and his deliberate avoidance of &quot;commercial-ness&quot; turned him into a huge international star.<br /><br />Well, he eventually (1977) became a Muslim and adopted the name &quot;Yusuf Islam&quot; (after the biblical dream-interpreter Joseph). At about that time he also left the music industry. He has since recorded a couple of albums about Islam, but his last collection of commercial music was _Footsteps In The Dark_ (ostensibly a second volume of his &quot;greatest hits,&quot; but in fact a set of lesser-known favorites and a handful of tunes not available elsewhere).<br /><br />You can feel safe in ignoring the comments from people who think he has become &quot;rigid&quot; and/or &quot;intolerant.&quot; The simple fact is that nearly every Cat Stevens album (the exceptions being his first two) is filled with &quot;spiritual seeking,&quot; and he eventually found what he was looking for in Islam. His &quot;recent&quot; (actually, 1989-90) remarks on Salman Rushdie were not what you probably think they were (and in particular he didn't call for Rushdie's death). He's no more &quot;rigid&quot; or &quot;intolerant&quot; than the rest of us; he's simply a religiously observant Muslim, that's all.

This fine volume by Judith Jarvis Thomson may be the best analysis of rights out there.<br /><br />Thomson breaks her discussion into two parts. In roughly the first half of the book, she carefully analyzes what it means to have a &quot;right.&quot; In the second, she sets out to determine, as far as possible, just exactly _which_ rights we have.<br /><br />Part one leans heavily on Wesley Hohfeld, a legal theorist who in the early twentieth century wrote two seminal papers (I hate describing papers as &quot;seminal,&quot; but these two really are) on the taxonomy of legal rights, claims, duties, and so forth. Thomson imports Hohfeld's taxonomy into her discussion of moral rights, in the process subjecting it to exacting scrutiny (and some tweezing), and uses it as a foundation for a thorough analysis of just what is involved in possessing a &quot;right.&quot;<br /><br />Part two sets out a clear analysis of the usual classical-liberal/libertarian rights to life, liberty, and property. Here I shall comment only that if Ayn Rand had written with half the clarity, rigor, and just plain _reasonableness_ that Thomson brings to bear on this topic, she might have been the philosopher she thought she was. (And she wouldn't have tried to reduce ethics to rational self-interest.)<br /><br />But Rand's handwaving non-account of reason would have caved in if she had tried to use it for anything like this. Thomson's foundational claim, as explained in an introduction that alone is worth the price of the entire book, is that we really do have rational insight into necessary moral truths; she therefore stands firmly in the rationalist-intuitionist line of succession that Rand rejected. (Thomson mentions W.D. Ross only once, in a footnote, but she is clearly on his side on the topic of &quot;prima facie duty.&quot; She doesn't think he gave a fully satisfactory account of such duties -- well, neither do I -- but she is certain that we all know what it was he was trying to give an account _of_.)<br /><br />I therefore -- despite some disagreements, notably with Thomson's well-known conclusions on abortion -- highly recommend Thomson's incisive account of rights to one and all in the classical-liberal/libertarian camp. If more such accounts were written to this standard (rather than to Rand's), &quot;pop libertarians&quot; (or what Murray Rothbard called &quot;modal libertarians&quot;) would have a harder time regarding themselves as philosophers merely because they had read ATLAS SHRUGGED ten or twenty times.<br /><br />I also recommend it to everybody else, and especially to law students (at least the ones with time to kill). Thomson's account of moral reasoning, like Ross's, looks an awful lot like the sort of _legal_ reasoning we all get to practice in law school.<br /><br />Warning: Thomson is a very graceful writer and her prose is occasionally wryly humorous. But above all it is precise and dense; don't expect to read through this book in a single sitting, or even in ten such sittings. It _isn't_ hard to read, but you'll need to take your time: Thomson packs more into a paragraph of her adamantine prose than many writers pack into an entire chapter.account _of_.)<br /><br />I therefore -- despite some disagreements, notably with Thomson's well-known conclusions on abortion -- highly recommend Thomson's incisive account of rights to one and all in the classical-liberal/libertarian camp.

Books	4	31	37	N	N	Nicely done	How do you bring home to children the point that God is ultimately the only reality and that everything else is God's activity -- that, in the final analysis, the world is just &quot;made of&quot; God and nothing else?<br /><br />(For that matter, how do you bring it home to _adults_ -- who, especially if they've been warned about this sort of thing by dog-in-the-manger &quot;theologians&quot; who read the words but didn't hear the music, are all too likely mistake it for either pantheism or self-worship?)<br /><br />Well, really, nobody can bring it home to anybody else; we can only offer each other opportunities to realize it more or less directly. But Etan Boritzer has done a very nice job of giving children a chance to experience this truth, and Robbie Marantz has done some fine illustrations to accompany Boritzer's text.<br /><br />Boritzer simply raises the title question -- &quot;What is God?&quot; -- and informs the reader that various answers have been proposed, mostly by teachers who lived a long time ago. (Parents of most religions will find this approach as inoffensive as I do, but some Christian readers will likely object to Boritzer's treatment of Jesus as one teacher among others. And all readers should be aware that Boritzer is not introducing or favoring any particular religious tradition here.) He pokes a little bit of gentle fun at the view that God is a white-bearded old man who lives in the sky.<br /><br />Boritzer then notes that most religions teach essentially the same things, at least as regards the standards of ethical human behavior. (Of course this is a tremendous oversimplification, but it is true at a sufficiently high level of generality.) Moreover, he places the responsibility for religious wars firmly on those people who don't know this.<br /><br />But never mind ethics; not all religions say the same things about God, right? So can they all be right?<br /><br />Sure they can, Boritzer concludes. _Anything_ that is true must be true of God, because there isn't anything else for it to be true _of_. God is all there is -- so the wind is God and the stars are God and you are God and I am God . . .<br /><br />(That's the part that will bother some readers, who may not recognize the difference between Boritzer's claim and the very different claim that _you personally_ are the Almighty and All-knowing Creator of the Cosmos. Suffice it to say that this isn't what Boritzer means, and if you don't see what he _does_ mean, you'll have some trouble explaining it to your kids.)<br /><br />Boritzer makes a few remarks on prayer and concludes by inviting the reader to experience his or her &quot;connectedness&quot; with everyone and everything else. Parents who want to introduce their children to meditation or contemplative prayer couldn't ask for a better opening.<br /><br />The whole thing is very well-executed. I won't try to recommend companion volumes for grown-ups, because any parent who buys this book has already got a shelf-ful of the relevant literature. If you know what I'm talking about and you want to introduce your kids to it, this is a good book to use.<br /><br />The information above says the book is suitable for ages 9-12, but I think it's probably okay for a broader range than that.

Casey sets out in this volume to describe the developmental process of New Testament Christology, and his work includes some features which provide correctives to other such accounts.<br /><br />For one thing, while Casey locates Jesus firmly within the Judaism of his time, he does not gloss over the likely disagreements between Jesus and other intra-Jewish movements. Readers of e.g. Ed Sanders's magisterial _Jesus and Judaism_ or Hyam Maccoby's trenchant _Revolution in Judea_ might come away with the impression that there just weren't any important differences between Jesus and the Pharisees. Casey argues to the contrary that there were very serious points of contention between them, notably on the issues of purity and Sabbath observance.<br /><br />For another, Casey recognizes that many elements of Jesus's career do have a firmer foundation in Second Temple Judaism than is sometimes acknowledged. I am thinking here particularly though not exclusively of Casey's claim that Jesus probably did view his death as a propitiation that would in some way turn away the divine wrath.<br /><br />Casey also does a nice job sorting through later New Testament Christology. His overarching aim seems to be to locate the point at which such Christology finally and irrevocably departed from Judaism altogether -- and he locates this point in the gospel of John, the apparent claim of Jesus's alleged deity being, Casey say, &quot;_inherently_ unJewish&quot; [p. 176]. (Casey, as he further explains in a later book, thinks the Johannine gospel's apparent claims on this point were in part intended as non- or anti-Judaic &quot;identity markers&quot; for a Gentile community. I think Casey's claims here are overstated, and readers looking for an alternative view may want to examine Ellis Rivkin's _What Crucified Jesus?_)<br /><br />Casey's Harnackian conclusion is a familiar one to readers of this literature: Christianity would profit by shifting away from the religion _about_ Jesus toward the religion _of_ Jesus.<br /><br />Since the religion of Jesus was Judaism, it is unfortunately not as clear as one might wish precisely what Christians are supposed to do. Nevertheless Casey's closing remark is pointed and apt: &quot;If churches as organizations must insist on false belief we can always leave them, and follow from outside their orbit those aspects of the teaching of Jesus which we judge relevant to our lives 2,000 years later&quot; [p. 178].<br /><br />In this sense, despite some deep disagreements on certain points, Casey's work nicely complements that of Geza Vermes. As Vermes has recently covered some of the same Christological-development ground in _The Changing Faces of Jesus_, readers interested in the project of reclaiming Jesus as a Jew of his own time and place may wish to consult Casey as well.erature: Christianity would profit by shifting away from the religion _about_ Jesus toward the religion _of_ Jesus.<br /><br />Since the religion of Jesus was Judaism, it is unfortunately not as clear as one might wish precisely what Christians are supposed to do.

Books	3	17	24	N	N	Not bad	And if you're a law student worried about your grades, by all means grab a copy of this little book. The advice is sound, although (as other reviewers have noted) you'll need to practice like heck if you want it to help you.<br /><br />Frankly, though, this little book will be of most help to the people who need it least -- namely, One-Ls who are already devoting all of their time and attention to their studies, hanging out with each other, talking about the law together, writing outlines together, working sample problems together, and so forth. If you don't or can't do that stuff, this book may help you a little bit, but it won't help you much. And if you _do_ do that stuff, this book will add almost nothing to what you're already doing.<br /><br />I don't want to minimize the importance of grades in law school, but the fact is that they few times anyone has checked, they haven't correlated at all with professional performance. (And you may already know that something like 85% of One-Ls finish their first year without getting a single A.) If you want As, I hope you get them -- and more power to you if you _do_ get them; they're a real achievement. But I really think the best thing to do is to quit worrying about your grades, relax, and just _learn_. In four or five years nobody is going to care what your first-year GPA was.<br /><br />But you won't make it that far if you give yourself a heart attack before your second year. Law school _is_ tough; the standards are higher than any that most of us are used to, we're finally competing directly and solely against people whose academic records are at least as good as our own, and many of us who are used to getting As will turn out to be B students or lower. No book in the world is going to alter that.<br /><br />So if your law school (like mine) passes out free copies of this book, by all means read it. But think twice before spending money on this book or any other that will tell you how to get high grades in law school.ol.	2001-06-04

It also contains interesting tidbits of great relevance to those who want to know what's wrong with the legal profession.<br /><br />(For example, here's a point libertarians will enjoy. Lawyers once tried to get around the silly practice of accounting for everything in &quot;billable hours&quot; by settling on standard fees for certain common legal tasks. What stopped them? Antitrust law. It seems adopting industry-standard fees is a form of collusion in restraint of trade. Thank heavens; the current system is _ever_ so much better.)<br /><br />Not long on solutions, this volume is still a solid overview of the sort of nonsense engendered by the adversarial system. It's also a list of good reasons to look into alternative dispute resolution the next time _you_ have a legal problem.<br /><br />For law students, I'd personally recommend supplementing it with any or all of the following: Mary Ann Glendon's _A Nation Under Lawyers_; Deborah Rhode's _In the Interests of Justice_; and Philip Howard's _The Death of Common Sense_.	2001-06-04

It's been described as a bit short on solutions, but perhaps those critics don't know that common law generates solutions as it goes.<br /><br />This book is in some ways a &quot;prequel&quot; to Deborah Rhode's excellent _In the Interests of Justice_. I highly recommend that anyone interested in one of them get the other one too.<br /><br />Glendon, also the author of _Rights Talk_, includes some nice treats in this work. For one thing, there's a lot of gentle debunking of the view that law practice ever enjoyed a &quot;golden age.&quot; Glendon has a keen awareness of the fact that this &quot;golden age&quot; was in fact an age of rich white people's old-boys clubs and the much-vaunted &quot;professionalism&quot; of the period had the effect (not entirely unintended) of keeping racial and religious minorities, as well as women, out of the profession altogether (or at least driving them into the less prestigious areas of the law).<br /><br />She also has some important words on the (related) hypocrisy of the legal profession's opposition to &quot;commercialism.&quot; Her own view is that genuine commercialism carries with it a commitment to honesty and fairness; the predominant view among the bar associations, at least, seems to be that when you're acting &quot;commercially,&quot; anything goes. Those of us who want the legal profession to act professional would do well to heed Glendon here and stop denouncing the market for the sins of those who don't understand it.<br /><br />There are also some engaging reminiscences about the late great Karl Llewellyn, one of the most prominent legal scholars of the twentieth century and chief architect of the Uniform Commercial Code. Glendon infects the reader, as she herself was infected, with Llewellyn's love of the common-law tradition and the power of judge-made law.<br /><br />Nor have I exhausted everything this book has to offer. Suffice it to say, by way of conclusion, that Glendon turns in a nice analysis of the changes the legal profession has undergone over the last few decades.<br /><br />A fine book all around, then -- and incidentally a nice companion to Philip Howard's _The Death of Common Sense_. Howard, too, would like to see a move away from the hyperregulatory state and toward the empowerment of the common-law judge; Glendon's book is complementary to his in some ways. Readers of one will probably enjoy the other.<br />Nor have I exhausted everything this book has to offer.

With rare exceptions (the late John A.T. Robinson comes to mind), the Christian gospel of John is usually assigned a comparatively late date and its understanding of Jesus regarded as a pretty well-developed &quot;high&quot; christology. It is therefore usual, at least among theologically liberal scholars, to dismiss it as almost entirely unhistorical. (Interestingly, this dismissal is usually performed by Christians, of whom I am not one.)<br /><br />Stevan Davies, himself a secularist New Testament scholar, here makes an interesting argument that such dismissal may be unnecessary. His claim is that Jesus sometimes underwent spirit-possession, speaking and healing while in a &quot;trance state&quot; known as the &quot;kingdom of God.&quot;<br /><br />This view has a number of advantages. First, it allows us to recognize John as a possibly historical source of at least some of Jesus's spirit-entranced speeches. Second, it deals neatly with a problem that faces those who attribute the Johannine speeches to early Christians &quot;speaking in the spirit&quot;: why would anyone think they sounded like Jesus if Jesus himself never talked that way? Third, it links Jesus's speech closely to his healings and exorcisms, and therefore resists the tendency to reduce Jesus to a merely &quot;ethical teacher.&quot; And fourth, it offers us at least the beginning of a way to assimilate even the Johannine Jesus to the Judaism of his time -- not, indeed, as an academic-Marxist &quot;empowerer of the oppressed,&quot; but as a charismatic holy man announcing (perhaps mistakenly) the eschatological reign of God.<br /><br />Davies may overstep a bit in arguing that even Jesus's parables were therapeutic in nature. Nevertheless there is a foundation even for this claim, at least if we allow that Jesus's parables were not merely tales to be listened to passively but little &quot;story-bombs&quot; intended to bring about spiritual transformations and paradigm shifts.<br /><br />I do not think Davies provides a full picture either of Jesus or of the &quot;kingdom&quot; he announced; nor does Davies claim to do so (in fact he expressly acknowledges that he has _not_ done so). Nevertheless, though there are parts of the New Testament record that resist assimilation to Davies's account, he has provided a new window into the gospel of John that may prove helpful in the task of placing Jesus properly into his own time and place -- i.e., as the faithful Jew that he was, and not as the &quot;liberation theologian&quot; some modern readers might like him to be.ink Davies provides a full picture either of Jesus or of the &quot;kingdom&quot; he announced; nor does Davies claim to do so (in fact he expressly acknowledges that he has _not_ done so).

Unfortunately that fine volume is out of print.<br /><br />Trude Weiss-Rosmarin's little book is a distant second. This is  in part because she focuses so exclusively on the differences between Judaism and Christianity (whereas Rabbi Silver deals also with other religious outlooks, including Hinduism, Buddhism and Taoism). It is also in part because she is pretty vehement in her denunciation of Jesus's own teachings, without noticing that she is relying almost exclusively on Paul in interpreting those teachings. (Nor is this merely because she wrote before &quot;recent&quot; scholarship rediscovered that Jesus was Jewish. Jewish scholarship has long recognized as much.)<br /><br />For all that, this book does provide a sound summary of the theological differences between Judaism and Christianity. I find that she overstates some of the differences, but her work provides a valuable service on two main counts. First, it can help to protect Jews &quot;near the margins&quot; against Christian evangelization efforts. Second, it can help to stimulate Christians to rethink their own theology, with a view toward bringing it into line with the Torah in which Jesus himself believed.<br /><br />One drawback, though, is the following. Moses Maimonides and others have long held that Jesus and Christianity (and for that matter Mohammed and Islam) are the means by which Torah values are spread to the world and as such are part of the Divine plan. The reader of Weiss-Rosmarin's book will not gain any sense of Christianity's role in civilizing the West or, indeed, much of anything positive about it at all.	2001-05-29

In about 400 pages Rabbi Cohen hits all the major Talmudic themes: God and man, revelation, Jewish practice including ethics and jurisprudence.

Stephen Mitchell gives fair warning in his title (it's &quot;a,&quot; not &quot;the&quot; Book of Psalms) and his short introduction (in which he states his intent to &quot;[s]ing to the Lord a _new_ song&quot; by following the spirit rather than the letter).<br /><br />And like all of Mitchell's work, these are lovely poetic renderings. But be aware that quite a few of them are (or at least include) improvisations that depart radically from the original text. Then, too, the local references to Jerusalem and/or the Temple have been erased and replaced with more universal allusions. (Other portions of the text are rendered even more politically correct.)<br /><br />My biggest beef is that Mitchell has turned most of the &quot;complaining&quot; Psalms (when he includes them at all; there are only fifty &quot;psalms&quot; in this volume) into statements of spiritual acquiescence. And he characterizes that acquiescence itself in terms that are foreign to the Psalms: e.g. Psalm 133's &quot;my heart is not proud&quot; is Buddhized to &quot;my mind is not noisy with desires.&quot;<br /><br />But it's excellent poetry, and Mitchell at least has the good sense not to stray too far from the text when he renders perennial favorites like Psalm 23.<br /><br />As poetry, then, this book is one of Mitchell's better works. Just don't expect the biblical Psalms.	2001-05-29

But you'd have to wade through an introduction that reads: &quot;I found that the entirety of K-N was a later interpolation by a talented but spiritually inferior redactor, and moreover J is clearly a doublet of I just as V is a doublet of U. I have therefore taken the liberty of rearranging the alphabet in a way that felt authentic to me, following the spirit rather than the letter.&quot;<br /><br />_Genesis_ is probably the clearest example of this tendency, as it's one of very few Mitchell works that's _supposed_ to be a complete and literal translation rather than a poetic rendering. And the translation, as always, is very, very good -- and very, very clear.<br /><br />Unfortunately he chops the text to bits -- relegating the allegedly inauthentic bits to the appendices and notes, and explaining in the introduction all the things he thinks are wrong with the &quot;redacted&quot; version of Genesis. It's almost as though there's a conservation law at work: when Mitchell can't mess with the translation itself, his editorial views emerge somewhere else, with a vengeance.<br /><br />I do not at all mean to imply that he has nothing important to say. On the contrary, some of his commentary is most helpful. He explains some very nice touches in his translation, and he does offer what seem to me to be some deep and genuine insights. (And he also does a nice job of showing how his translation is different from those of others.)<br /><br />But I do find myself almost gasping for breath when I see the credulity with which he buys into the JEDP &quot;documentary hypothesis&quot; -- and, for that matter, the sheer chutzpah with which he determines just which bits of the text are later additions by &quot;second- and third-rate writers&quot; [p. xxxv] and even &quot;dullard[s]&quot; [p. xl]. I'm not terribly impressed with the usual arguments that the text is full of contradictions and awkward &quot;doublets&quot; in the first place; nor does Mitchell even pretend to make any effort to resolve them. (And neither have I found two authors who would divide the texts in the same way based on these features.) But as I noted long ago in my review of Kikawada and Quinn's _Before Abraham Was_ (which see), if all these alleged problems didn't bother the alleged &quot;redactor,&quot; why do we think they would have bothered a single original author? Why not assume they are there for pedagogical reasons rather than inadvertently left there through mistake or stupidity?<br /><br />Mitchell is also inclined to make little &quot;arguments from moral indignation,&quot; in some cases even based on the _silence_ of the text on certain points. For example, he is properly repulsed by the manner in which the supposedly virtuous Lot offers his virgin daughters to the crowd beating on his door. But it is beyond me why he imagines -- for it must be imagination he uses here -- that the biblical author did _not_ object to this action.<br /><br />But the reader interested primarily in Mitchell's own spiritual progress will be happy to hear that the &quot;stories took on a stunning clarity&quot; for him after he had removed &quot;coat after coat of lacquer&quot; [p. xxxv]. In other words: as usual, when Mitchell removes the parts he doesn't agree with, he is quite unaccountably stunned and amazed to find that he likes what's left.<br /><br />On the whole, his translation is well worth reading. But be sure to keep the aspirin handy, and to put any breakable objects somewhere out of reach.rribly impressed with the usual arguments that the text is full of contradictions and awkward &quot;doublets&quot; in the first place; nor does Mitchell even pretend to make any effort to resolve them.

1984923:US	52474360	R3FCGFML31LOU	0060969598	910808942	The BOOK OF JOB	Books	5	130	132	N	N	All right, I'll give it five stars	. . . even though I'd like to deduct a star for its omissions.<br /><br />As with so much of Stephen Mitchell's work, it's easy to pick on him for what he's decided to leave out. Here, his translation of Job omits the hymn in praise of Wisdom and the speech (in fact the entire presence) of the young man Elihu. I tend to disagree with his reasons for skipping them (yes, yes, I know some scholars regard them as later additions). But having read his translation for nearly a decade now, I have to admit we don't miss them much.<br /><br />His work has been described as \\"muscular,\\" and that's a very apt term. Not only in Job's own language (from his \\"God damn the day I was born\\" to his closing near-silence after his experience of God) but in the voices of all the characters -- and most especially in the speech of the Voice from the Whirlwind -- Mitchell's meaty, pounding, pulse-quickening poetry just cries out to be read aloud.<br /><br />And as always, I have nothing but praise for Mitchell's gift of \\"listening\\" his way into a text and saying what it \\"wants\\" to say. In particular, his translation of the final lines has a wee surprise in store for anyone who hasn't already read it. (He disagrees with the usual repent-in-dust-and-ashes version and offers a denouement more fitting to the cosmic scope of Job's subject matter.)<br /><br />Moreover, all this and much else is discussed in a fine introduction that -- in my opinion as a longtime reader of Mitchell -- may well be his finest published commentary to date.<br /><br />Essentially, he deals with the so-called \\"problem of evil\\" by simply dissolving it. The God of Mitchell and of Mitchell's Job is not a feckless little half-deity who shares his cosmic powers with a demonic arch-enemy and sometimes loses; this God, like the God of the Torah itself (and incidentally of Catholic and Calvinist Christianity, at both of which which Mitchell takes a couple of not-altogether-responsible swipes), is the only Power there is. Ultimately God just _does_ everything that happens, because what's the alternative? \\"Don't you know that there _is_ nobody else in here?\\"<br /><br />As I suggested, there are a handful of half-hearted jabs at traditional (usually Christian) religion, but for the most part it should be possible for a theologically conservative reader simply to read around them. (This is a nice contrast with Mitchell's Jesus book, which -- to the mind of this non-Christian reviewer -- seems to be brimming with anti-Christian \\"spiritual oneupmanship.\\")<br /><br />So it's not only a fine translation that properly recognizes Job's central theme of spiritual transformation, but a universally valuable commentary into the bargain. If you haven't read any of Mitchell's other work, this is a great place to start. And if you _have_ read some of Mitchell's other work, do get around to this one.

Although I think Ed Sanders's _The Historical Figure of Jesus_ is probably the best single volume on the \\"Jesus of history,\\" Geza Vermes is perhaps my favorite writer on the subject.<br /><br />In the present work he continues his project of reclaiming Jesus as a (solely) human being and a Jew of his own time. Here he tackles a topic he has not treated in his previous three volumes: the Christian New Testament's presentation of Jesus outside of the three synoptic gospels. He also gives the synoptics themselves another look after he has dealt with John and Paul.<br /><br />His theme here is that Christian understanding(s) of Jesus have been colored heavily by the New Testament's portraits. Vermes wants to recover, as far as possible, the human being behind the theology. The portrait Vermes presents here will hold no surprises for readers of his other works: he regards Jesus as a charismatic Galilean holy man with an emphasis on God as father, a somewhat \\"individualistic\\" approach that decentralized the importance (though not the necessity) of the social/communal aspects of Torah observance, and the occasional touch of chauvinism.<br />There is much to accept in Vermes's portrait, and I am in essential agreement with most of it. My worries are about what he omits; as with his earlier work, I am simply unconvinced by his claim that Jesus was crucified simply for doing the wrong thing in the wrong place at the wrong time, and I also do not see that he has adequately dealt with the possible historicity of Jesus's resurrection. (I would supplement Vermes's account on these points by, respectively, Hyam Maccoby's _Revolution in Judea_ and Rabbi Pinchas Lapide's _The Resurrection of Jesus: A Jewish View_.)<br />But in its positive aspects, Vermes's portrait is compelling on the whole. And at the end of the volume, he shifts out of \\"historian\\" mode to provide a short fantasy about what Jesus might say if he returned today. I will not spoil it by giving away its content, but it's very nicely done.  (Okay, I'll give away a _little_ bit. Vermes's Jesus is pleasantly surprised by all the attention he's gotten from non-Jews, especially after the mean things he occasionally said about them. But he suggests that some Christians ought to be a little less devotional and a little more self-reliant.)<br />Beyond strictly historical interest, it has long been one of Vermes's main concerns to present the figure of Jesus as an offer of hope to those outside the fold of organized religion. His previous works have, I think, been successful in this regard; the present volume is, if anything, more so.ing away its content, but it's very nicely done.  (Okay, I'll give away a _little_ bit.

Prof. Richard Epstein has written a brilliant book here. His thesis, at heart, is that the world operates more efficiently and productively when legal rules are &quot;simple&quot; than when they are complex.<br /><br />In order to elaborate this thesis, he spells out just what he means by &quot;simple,&quot; proposes a handful of simple rules himself in various areas of law (property, contracts, torts), and shows how they play out in action (in, e.g., labor contracting, employment discrimination, and products liability). In each case he argues, with much success, that it just wouldn't be efficient to try to improve on the results provided by the &quot;simple&quot; rules.<br /><br />I especially recommend this book, and Epstein's work generally, to law students. Epstein's knowledge of the law is thorough and deep; One-Ls will find it useful to keep it handy for the whole year.<br /><br />So why only four stars? Partly because I think cost-benefit analysis is neither an adequate defense of liberty against the regulatory State nor an adequate foundation for law; and partly because Epstein's reliance on such analysis leads him toward (though he stops short of actually arriving at) positions I regard as non- or anti-libertarian.<br /><br />This review isn't the place to critique consequentialism; for a more or less standard and (I think) decisive critique, the reader is referred to W.D. Ross's _Foundations of Ethics_, which, after sixty-odd years, is still one of the most judicious works on ethics ever written. Suffice it to say that I think we can increase efficiency by pursuing justice, but not vice versa; consequentialism and its subspecies utilitarianism seem to me to be not so much ways of answering moral questions as of never raising them. The &quot;maximization&quot; of happiness is one ground of moral obligation, but not the only one. (And in general, I simply fail to understand recent libertarian interest in an ethical school founded by a man who regarded natural rights as &quot;nonsense&quot; and imprescriptible natural rights as &quot;nonsense upon stilts.&quot;)<br /><br />More serious, from a libertarian point of view, is that Epstein comes within inches of allowing a positive role for antitrust law. Now, mind you, he doesn't _quite_ do so. Indeed he calls for the repeal of the Sherman Act and related legislation, and he opposes the use of government power to distinguish between &quot;corporate combinations that increase market competition&quot; (p. 125) from those that do otherwise. (Note that his understanding of &quot;competition&quot; is thoroughly Chicago-school, a point for which Austrian theorists have quite properly taken him to task.)<br /><br />Yet his only ground for this latter opposition is merely that government agencies can't _tell_ which are which. Some corporate mergers, he says, may actually increase efficiency. Well, what about those that don't? Is he opposed in principle to such &quot;inefficient&quot; mergers? Would it be okay if the government stepped in to kill a merger that _was_ clearly &quot;inefficient&quot; by Epstein's standards? Or does he think there would be something morally wrong with outlawing certain uses of people's justly acquired property merely because somebody can think of a more &quot;efficient&quot; use?<br /><br />Unfortunately Epstein's consequentialist approach prevents him from giving the standard libertarian answer. It seems that, for him, the rights of property and trade are dependent not merely on their promotion of &quot;happiness&quot; but, more specifically, on their service to the aggregate good -- where, most significantly, this &quot;good&quot; is apparently defined quite independently of justice.<br /><br />So I have to knock off one star for inadequate moral foundations. But don't let that stop you from reading the book: Epstein's cost-benefit approach is solid as far as it goes. It just doesn't go far enough.l rights as &quot;nonsense&quot; and imprescriptible natural rights as &quot;nonsense upon stilts.&quot;)<br /><br />More serious, from a libertarian point of view, is that Epstein comes within inches of allowing a positive role for antitrust law.

If so, can we acquire knowledge of them via nonsensory means (i.e., reason or rational intuition)?<br /><br />To both these questions Jerrold Katz answers &quot;yes.&quot; And his sterling account is on all counts a welcome relief from the interminable parade of militant empiricism that seems to have taken over the streets of modern philosophy.<br /><br />Even at that, I suspect Katz has conceded a bit more to empiricism than I would. He holds, for example, that we need not &quot;causally interact&quot; with abstract objects in order to have knowledge of them. Well, perhaps we don't, but I don't see why the claim is objectionable; the contrary claim that timeless objects don't participate in temporal causal processes is a premise that surely deserves to be questioned. (I think it's false.)<br /><br />Then, too, I don't see that Katz ever questions whether we can acquire even _sensory_ knowledge apart from reason. I don't think we can -- but I wish Katz had at least raised the issue.<br /><br />Be that as it may, what Katz does offer is solid -- and dense; I despair of summarizing _any_ of his arguments in a short review. The skinny of it is that he thinks mathematical objects are real, and indeed that mathematics is a sort of testing lab for philosophy.<br /><br />A note on the title of my review: I read this book two or three years ago and just now returned to it after reading David Koepsell's _The Ontology of Cyberspace_ -- a book in which there's darned little actual ontology, and what there is of it isn't very good. Katz's account of mathematical objects is a good cure, and it would have been nice if some &quot;web ontologists&quot; had read it.<br /><br />(Hey, and maybe some &quot;Objectivists&quot; should read it too. Ayn Rand's own impoverished account of &quot;reason&quot; doesn't leave reason anything to do except sort out sensory impressions into file folders, and as such is exactly the sort of &quot;empiricism&quot; at which Katz takes aim.)tz takes aim.)	2001-05-17

What I do not see is how Koepsell's discussion of &quot;ontology&quot; gets him there.<br /><br />As for that ontology itself, Koepsell tempts me to climb onto a few of my favorite hobby-horses. (For example, he adopts popular misconceptions about &quot;idealism&quot; and &quot;realism&quot; all but wholesale, treats the two as contraries, and moreover fails to distinguish properly between subjective and objective idealism. The traditional foil of &quot;idealism&quot; is not &quot;realism&quot; but &quot;materialism&quot;; properly understood, idealism is itself a form of realism.) In general, though I don't wish to be too harsh here, I was not enormously impressed by the alleged philosophical sophistication of his approach (quite apart from my specific disagreements with it). On the contrary, it seems to me to be &quot;deeply superficial&quot; and littered with misunderstandings (not to mention airy references to Aristotle) to the extent that it succeeds in saying anything at all.<br /><br />What Koepsell means by &quot;ontology&quot; is better described simply as sorting things into kinds. (Have you ever sorted laundry? Congratulations: you were doing ontology, just the way Aristotle did!) What I would call the genuinely ontological questions -- e.g. whether and in what way kinds themselves actually exist; whether and in what sense there are any real universals -- never arise. (Being a &quot;web ontologist&quot; is therefore, one supposes, a _much_ easier job than being an ontologist.) Which also means that we never reach any significant questions about whether and how computer-based abstract objects exist -- an odd feature in a book allegedly dealing with the ontology of cyberspace.<br /><br />Now, mind you, I have no objection at all to attempts to classify computer-based objects. But I suspect a naked emperor is at work in all this talk of &quot;ontology&quot;: if there is anything in it beyond an attempt to lend an aura of sophistication and high intellectual lineage to consultants on dotcommery, I have failed to find it.<br /><br />But readers interested in these topics can sort through my older reviews (or drop me a line) in order to find better books on philosophy. (Or, for a good book specifically on ontology, scare up a used copy of E. Jonathan Lowe's undeservedly-out-of-print _Kinds of Being_.) Rather than pick more nits about philosophical misconceptions, I'd prefer to ask a more fundamental question: how does all this &quot;ontology&quot; advance Koepsell's argument in the first place?<br /><br />For it seems to me that his case would not have suffered the slightest loss had he left out his first few chapters and gone straight to his point. So far as I can tell, at the level of generality at which his &quot;ontology&quot; operates, there is nothing whatsoever from which his specific conclusions about the nature of cyber-objects can be derived.<br /><br />Nor do his conclusions seem to be compatible _only_ with his essentially Searlean empiricist/materialist outlook. My own is quite different from his (I am a rationalist and an objective idealist with a more or less Platonic view of universals) -- and yet, somehow, I manage to agree that computer-based objects live right here in the ordinary world rather than in some mystical cyber-realm. So what exactly has all this &quot;ontologizing&quot; added to his case?<br /><br />Now, I've been a little hard on Koepsell's book here, but I don't mean to imply that it isn't worth reading. Far from it: it's actually very good once all the ontologizing stops and the discussion of cyberlaw gets seriously rolling.<br /><br />Just don't make the mistake of supposing that accepting Koepsell's legal conclusions commits you to his metaphysical premises. Frankly, his philosophical machinery is poorly designed -- and, fortunately, largely unused.'t worth reading.

A longtime practitioner of ADR herself, she is eminently qualified to introduce the subject.<br /><br />In this handy volume, that is just what she does -- from the origins and growth of the field, to the various types of ADR, to the fields in which it is useful and the conditions under which it typically succeeds (or fails). Moreover, the 1994 edition is heavily revised and updated to include developments in the field since the book's original publication.<br /><br />Though not really a \\"how-to\\" book, the volume nevertheless contains useful insights into the nature of ADR practice and even excerpts from actual conflict-resolution sessions (for example a divorce mediation). Singer does not present ADR as a panacea for all the world's problems, but she does offer a very hopeful account of its broad and growing usefulness. Her discussion should be of interest to a wide range of readers with reason to care about alternatives to litigaton.<br /><br />For one thing, ADR is often less expensive in both time and money than adversarial litigation -- and even when it isn't, because the process leaves as much power as possible in the hands of the parties themselves, its solutions tend to be more inclusive of the participants' own real interests and more conducive to the genuine harmonization thereof.<br /><br />For another, ADR is a nice way to keep power out of the hands of political tyrants. As such, it should attract the attention not only of libertarians and classical liberals, but generally of anyone who is worried about the overgrowth of legislation and litigiousness here in the good ol' U.S. of A. As with certain topics in the common law, the value and importance of ADR is one subject on which political thinkers of almost all stripes should agree.<br /><br />There are lots of books out there about how to perform ADR.

Dealing by turns with the formation of contracts, the importance of \\"consideration,\\" the appropriateness of damages in case of breach, the problems of e.g. duress and unconscionability (and the special difficulties they pose for his account), and a variety of other topics that will be familiar to legal scholars and law students alike, Fried briefly, economically, and effectively rationalizes contract law on this unabashedly moral foundation.<br /><br />In this he is going against the tide and harking back to the \\"classical\\" understanding of contract law. But he is not uncritical of that tradition and is quite willing to lambaste it when necessary -- as with, for example, the traditional unwillingness to award damages for certain cases of fraud on the misguided argument that no contract had actually been formed in such cases. (On this point he holds -- in my view quite rightly -- that traditional thinkers were \\"supremely guilty\\" of a tremendous nonsequitur.)<br /><br />On the contrary, he is keenly aware both that contract law is a bulwark of liberty in allowing us to order our own affairs, _and_ that contractual obligations are not the only obligations there are -- indeed that contractual obligation itself cannot get off the ground unless we have a prior, unchosen moral obligation to abide by our promises. In this respect he is a breath of fresh air compared with certain pseudo-libertarian writers and pop-culture icons who reduce all moral obligations to those voluntarily assumed by contract (and I am thinking here specifically of Ayn Rand, among others).

If you've read _Dune_ (and if you have sufficient perspective on its flaws to enjoy watching them skewered in a spot-on parody), then scare up a copy of this delightful little book.<br /><br />Follow the young duke, Pall Agamemnides, as he travels the sugar-frosted wastes of Arruckus, the Dessert Planet -- where the giant pretzel roams and the Freedmenmen brew beer from its wastes, and where the never-ending search for a genuine _entree_ keeps everyone on the alert for the offworlder who is supposed to show up, someday, with recipes.<br /><br />Is Pall the Kumquat Haagendasz? That's what the Boni Maroni want to know. But that's not all: the Boni Maroni's own Missionaria Phonibalonica has seeded Arruckus with tales of a savior, and so the Freedmenmen, too, have some sharp questions about this odd young fellow who has adopted the name Mauve'Bib (after the purple neckerchief worn by the beer-chugging natives).<br /><br />Will their questions be answered? Perhaps, but will their answers be questioned? Perhaps, but will _those_ questions be answered? Perhaps, but . . . (See, it's like a plan within a plan within a plan. Or a feint within a feint within a feint. Or something.)<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Baron Vladimir Hardchargin has a plan to control beer production on Arruckus through his nephew, Filp-Rotha (get it? Think _Portnoy's Complaint_). Will the Pahdedbrah Emperor, Shaddap IV, catch on in time? Or will his crack comedians, the Hardehaurhar, be made to serve the Baron's sinister plan?<br /><br />All in all, a brilliant sendup of Frank Herbert's masterpiece, right down to the glossary -- and, perhaps not incidentally, a delightful translation of his tale from the original quasi-Arabic into Catskill Yiddish. Don't forget to put the kreplock on your chiksoop while you curl up with this one.	2001-05-16

This is one of them. (The other is W. David Slawson's _Binding Promises_, which I've reviewed as well.)<br /><br />In this volume, Deborah L. Rhode sets out to tell us what is wrong with the legal profession and how to fix it.<br /><br />That's a big job, and it is to her credit that she succeeds as well as she does. Rhode's exposition is a delight: she possesses an absolutely first-rate critical intelligence (including a highly sensitive B.S. detector); she writes clearly and gracefully; and she has an insider's view of the legal profession. As a result she has a firm grasp of the competing incentives facing both lawyers and legislators, as well as a keen insight into the self-serving rhetoric of the bar associations.<br /><br />I will not bother picking nits about minor points. Rhode offers, and discusses at length, two absolutely critical insights which should be not only read but shouted from the rooftops by anyone concerned with the present state of the legal profession. These are as follows:<br /><br />(1) The legal profession uses the power of the law to act in an anti-competitive fashion and prevent the intrusion of lower-cost alternatives into its market -- all the while proclaiming itself to be above sordid and crass &quot;commercialism,&quot; as though the practice of having paralegals thrown in jail is _really_ intended for the &quot;public good&quot; and only _happens_ to protect overpriced attorneys from competition.<br /><br />(2) Legal education, as currently practiced, is neither necessary nor sufficient as preparation for either law practice or legal scholarship. Moreover, the few times anybody has bothered to check, there has been basically no correlation whatsoever between law school performance and professional performance.<br /><br />The second of these is actually a consequence of the first, and I would have liked to see more discussion of this point than Rhode provides. The ineffectiveness and irrelevance of legal &quot;education&quot; is a direct, economically intelligible consequence of the legal profession's casting itself as a sort of intellectual priesthood and maintaining its &quot;guild&quot; status by law; here I think Rhode could profit from a closer look at her own inconsistent case for the value of competition.<br />But I won't argue the point here. This is a terrific book all around, and every lawyer and law student should probably read it if possible.<br /><br />Also recommended: Mary Ann Glendon's _A Nation Under Lawyers_, especially for its delightful debunking of the legal profession's attacks on &quot;commercialism.&quot; In this respect and others, Rhode's book is a worthy successor to Glendon's and belongs on the shelf next to it.the first, and I would have liked to see more discussion of this point than Rhode provides.

This is one of them. (The other is Deborah Rhode's brilliant _In The Interests of Justice_.)<br /><br />W. David Slawson has the distinction of having written (twenty years ago) what may be one of the worst books on the dangers of inflation ever committed to print. He has also been, to my own mind at least, consistently on the wrong side of the Microsoft case. But it doesn't matter what other disagreements I may have with him; this is a great book.<br /><br />In contrast to the more-or-less classical &quot;four corners&quot; approach to contracts, Slawson's essential thesis is that the terms of a contract just _are_ the reasonable expectations of its parties. In this work he traces the growth and influence of this view (and nearby views) through the modern (roughly post-1960) reformation of contract law at the hands of common-law judges.<br /><br />It's very well done. As the reader might expect, there's quite a bit of material on the development of the Uniform Commercial Code and the intentions of the late great Karl Llewellyn; there's also some trenchant criticism of the UCC, which in Slawson's view tends to hamper the developmental process of common law. Then, too, there's some terrific exposition of the modern tendency to fudge the line between contract and tort law and indeed to assimilate portions of contract law to the law of (what Slawson calls) &quot;relational torts.&quot;<br /><br />Much of the exposition rests on Slawson's understanding of &quot;bargaining power&quot; -- i.e., the power to set the terms of a contract. This power, on his view, has basically nothing to do with &quot;market power&quot; and everything to do with knowledge: in the modern economy, product manufacturers are in a much, much better position both to determine the terms of consumer contracts via the use of standard forms and to have precise, detailed knowledge of the risks associated with their products. As a result, though Slawson does not quite put the matter this way, the traditional common law that was (and is) appropriate for dealings between merchants is not appropriate for dealings between merchants and consumers.<br /><br />Here I heartily concur -- especially as Slawson is careful to rely on common law rather than positive legislation as the foundation for reform and indeed to argue that regulatory standards aren't very effective in this regard anyway. (Slawson even dedicates the volume to the common-law judge.) And this is one area in which legal thinkers of all political stripes should be able to meet and agree: Slawson's view of contracts is eminently sensible and even common-sensical, as (he points out several times) his own students uniformly recognize when they are introduced to it. Moreover, &quot;judicial activism&quot; in courts at common law just isn't the danger to liberty that it is among Supreme Court justices and federal judges.<br /><br />Be that as it may, Slawson's discussion is thorough and helpful. Quite apart from issues of practical politics, his work is a valuable history of the reformation of the law of contracts during the latter half of the twentieth century. As such, it should be of interest to law students and legal scholars alike.

However, if you're a One-L looking for a study aid, there are a couple of things you should be aware of.<br /><br />First of all, the most recent edition of this text dates from 1984. That means quite a bit of it is at least slightly out of date, and some of it is massively so (particularly in the field of products liability). For a more up-to-date hornbook, consider Dobbs. (I bought and used both.)<br /><br />Second, when your torts professor talks about &quot;black-letter law,&quot; s/he's not talking about this hornbook or any other; s/he's usually talking about the Restatement (Second) of Torts (or, in products liability, the Restatement (Third)). As much as I like hornbooks (and I am emphatically not a fan of the &quot;casebook&quot; approach), I have to say that if you want to get _one_ text to supplement your casebook, you should pick up _A Concise Restatement of Torts_ from the American Law Institute. And, ideally, you should memorize large portions of it.<br /><br />Of course, you can do what I did: buy all three. It's a great investment, and it will pay off in your studies; Prosser and Keeton provide much helpful discussion of points that Dobbs treats more briefly, and the Concise Restatement is much easier to understand once you've digested the hornbook(s).<br /><br />At any rate, this _is_ a classic text and you shouldn't go without it for any longer than necessary. Just be aware of what you're buying and set your priorities accordingly.	2001-05-14

Dobbs breaks the topic up into lots of subtopics and provides easily-digested discussions under each heading. The result is a longer book than Prosser and Keeton, but it's easier to read in many ways.<br /><br />It's also more up-to-date; Prosser's classic work was most recenty updated in 1984, which means that much of the field (especially products liability) has left it in the dust. However, if you can possibly do so, try to get both: Prosser's more extended discussions are classics in the field, and deservedly so.<br /><br />And if you want just _one_ text to supplement your casebook, I'd recommend _A Concise Restatement of Torts_, published by the American Law Institute. That's the text to use for &quot;black-letter law.&quot;<br /><br />Ideally, you can do what I did: get all three.	2001-05-14

If you're a One-L, buy this early and use it often; it'll go with pretty much whatever casebook you happen to be using (mine was Yeazell). It's extremely well-designed and its discussions are clear and sound.<br /><br />If you're looking around in order to decide whether you need a hornbook at all, the answer is: yes, you probably do. There may be students who can squeeze a profitable education out of the &quot;casebook&quot; approach, but I'm not one of them and you probably aren't either.<br /><br />During your first semester, it will be tempting to spend a lot of time briefing cases. Don't let me talk you out of doing so, or you'll be really mad at me the first time you get called on unprepared. But you'll probably be better off spending a little less time briefing and a little more time reading this hornbook first.	2001-05-14

Allan Farnsworth was a reporter for the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, and until the American Law Institute publishes a Concise Restatement of Contracts, this book is about as close as we're going to get.<br /><br />This volume is a one-volume condensation, for student use, of Farnsworth's three-volume treatise on contract law, and it's worth every penny it costs. It may, however, be a bit daunting for a One-L looking for a text to supplement the casebook, so you might consider using Calamari as your main hornbook.<br /><br />But my personal recommendation is that you buy both if you can; where Calamari is brief, Farnsworth elaborates a great deal and provides plenty of dense, helpful detail. I myself used Calamari for basic principles and Farnsworth for further discussion.<br /><br />Farnsworth is also the author of _Changing Your Mind: The Law of Regretted Decisions_.

Calamari's classic text provides clear and intelligible discussion of the basic principles of contract law.<br /><br />Also consider the student edition of E. Allan Farnsworth's treatise on Contracts; the original was three volumes long, but the student edition is condensed to one. Farnsworth's discussion is more in-depth, wide-ranging, and denser than Calamari's, so I used Calamari to get principles clear and then turned to Farnsworth for elaboration.<br /><br />Get both if you can; otherwise get this one first.

Edward White begins with the rise of tort law as a separate discipline and traces its development through late nineteenth-century scientism; early twentieth-century legal realism; the contributions of Benjamin Cardozo, William Prosser, and Roger Traynor; and the &quot;neoconceptualism&quot; of the 1970s (the book was published in 1980). In this final chapter, he deals by turns with Richard Posner and Guido Calabresi on the law-and-economics side, and then with George Fletcher and Richard Epstein (the latter before he went over to the utilitarians).<br /><br />White's basic take on this intellectual history is one that is bound to raise a few hackles. Basically, he thinks that tort law itself covers a rather motley assortment of wrongs and cannot be reduced to a few simple principles; most of the ideas that have influenced the history of the field have taken hold, not because they arise from the field itself or because they have so much intrinsic worth, but simply because the scholars at certain influential institutions made them intellectually fashionable. That tort law resists rationalization by simple principles White regards as a good thing, because it keeps legal scholars from becoming a sort of intellectual priesthood.<br /><br />On a second reading, then, one can almost hear White chuckling as he describes Harvard Law School Dean Christopher Columbus Langdell's introduction of the &quot;casebook&quot; approach to legal education (yes, law students, this approach dates only from 1881): Langdell, it seems, thought that not only tort law but _all_ law could be summarized in a few simple principles that the student could extract in good empirical-scientific fashion from a few well-chosen cases. (Even Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., disagreed; the entire course of legal history since that time has confirmed that Langdell was wrong and White is right. Why the &quot;casebook&quot; approach is still the centerpiece of law education in the U.S. is therefore not altogether clear.)<br /><br />White is a good writer and he paces all of this quite readably. He is also the author of a number of other books -- including a biography of Earl Warren (for whom White clerked) and a history of baseball -- but I believe this volume was one of his first.<br /><br />Law students will probably find it at least indirectly helpful. We all meet both Cardozo and Prosser early in the first year, and Traynor appears when we get to products liability; I personally liked having White's book on hand in order to place this stuff in its historical context.<br /><br />And it will be of general interest to anyone who doesn't want the law to be handed over to a scholarly class of priests.ght.

In the tradition of Johannes Weiss and Albert Schweitzer, he has joined E.P. Sanders on the barricades to defend a view of Jesus as an eschatological/apocalyptic prophet.<br /><br />The entire volume is very well written and argued; in particular I heartily applaud both its destructive criticism of John Dominic Crossan and its refutation of Marcus Borg as against Sanders. (Both Crossan and Borg think Jesus was altogether noneschatological.)<br /><br />If I had to pick on one flaw, I would single out the following: I do not see that Allison makes clear the crucial difference between (a) announcing prophetically that the Messianic Age _is_ at hand and (b) announcing non-prophetically one's own _expectation_ to that effect. In particular I do not see that Allison has dealt with the gospels' own reports (in e.g. Mark 13) that Jesus himself did not claim to _know_ the &quot;day or the hour.&quot; Yet even on the most skeptical view of the gospels, passages that attribute ignorance to Jesus can surely not be dismissed as late additions. The issue is probably less important to me than it will be to Christians, but since the Messianic Age did _not_ dawn at that time, we should probably be a bit careful about making Jesus a false prophet!<br /><br />If I had to find a _second_ nit to pick, I'd probaby settle on Allison's emphasis on Jesus's asceticism. His remarks here are a fine corrective to a tendency in the opposite direction, but on the whole I think Allison goes a bit too far.<br /><br />Nicely done, though, and a valuable attempt to recover the eschatological dimension of Jesus's life and teaching. If Allison is essentially right -- and I think he is -- then, contra the assertions of some other scholars, most of the material in the Christian gospels is historical.	2001-04-03

(You'll find these remarks in _A Jewish Conservative Looks at Pagan America_. Feder is usually better than this.)<br /><br />But the fact is that Zappa was a genuine homegrown American original, a musical genius, and a thoroughly subversive Enemy Of The State. And whatever one thinks of their names, the rest of us should have children like Zappa's. (They're all grown up now, of course, but Moon was a highly poised young lady even at the age of thirteen. I don't remember seeing any of Feder's kids on talk shows when _they_ were teenagers.)<br /><br />Love or hate his music; agree or disagree that his sometimes-acerbic social commentary often went over the line into sheer pornography. If you want to meet the man himself, this book is the only one you need to read.<br /><br />It's all in his own words, as told to Peter Occhiogrosso. The style will be recognizable to anyone who has ever read the liner notes on a Zappa album. And the content is part autobiography, part correction of underground-rock-grapevine misconceptions, part almost-libertarian political activism, part musing on the nature of musical composition.<br /><br />A handful of highlights, chosen from among many: He proposes that music could be digitally downloaded, an idea whose time apparently hadn't come when Zappa first thought of it. The chapter on his \\"pornography trial\\" in the UK is hilarious, not least because it includes selections from the actual transcripts. And if you want to know _why_ his kids turned out so well-spoken and mature at such early ages, check out his advice on childrearing.<br /><br />By the way, Zappa did not do drugs, no matter how many well-meaning imbeciles tell you otherwise. On the contrary, he was one of a handful of anti-drug crusaders in the music industry, and one of an even smaller handful who wasn't a recovering addict himself. Reality is better than drugs anyway, and Zappa knew it.<br /><br />His untimely death from prostate cancer left a gaping hole; he was irreplaceable.

Anthony Burgess's approach is in one significant sense the opposite of Rand's: where she tried to project a hero (and in my opinion failed; John Galt seems to be little more than a one-dimensional abstraction), Burgess projects a thoroughly depraved teenager and forces us to root for him anyway. It's not every author who can make you watch a bunch of gratuitous sex'n'violence and _then_ conclude that even great moral depravity trumps behavioristic psychology and mechanistic determinism.<br /><br />What \\"protagonist\\" (or Your Humble Narrator, at any rate) Alex does in the first half of the novel will make you ill. But what the State does to him to \\"cure\\" him makes his nadsat gang violence seem almost . . . well, \\"innocent\\" isn't quite the right word, but the fact that I'm even thinking of that word is an indication of Anthony Burgess's power.<br /><br />For Burgess, the important thing is moral choice, and the possibility of choice entails the possibility of evil. Once Alex has been \\"reformed\\" by the very latest techniques of behavioristic science, it's no longer even _possible_ for him to be moral -- and that's somehow more horrible than any of his own horrible acts.<br /><br />But Burgess stops short of making volition an object of idolatry. In the first place, he doesn't make any argument that Alex's actions were somehow \\"good\\" merely because he had _chosen_ them; quite the contrary. In the second place, even though Alex bears the full blame for all his depraved actions, there are hints scattered throughout the book that if he weren't living in a \\"socialist paradise,\\" he just wouldn't have been acting this way in the first place. (For example, both his parents are required by law to work full-time. They also seem curiously unwilling to discipline their son, or even inquire what it is he does when he goes out at night.)<br /><br />I read this book twenty years ago in an edition that had something this one lacked: a glossary. I thought I was going to miss it, but I didn't; Burgess is a fine writer and anticipates his readers' needs very nicely. If the meaning of one of his Russian-import slang terms isn't obvious from context, he works in a definition. (And there are a few glossaries available online anyway.)<br /><br />The earlier edition also lacked something this one has: a twenty-first chapter. I hadn't read this before -- it was left out of the American edition of the book and therefore out of Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation as well -- but to my mind it makes a better ending for the book.<br /><br />Sure, as Burgess himself admits, it's a little crude; we never actually _see_ Alex develop into an adult, we just suddenly learn at the end that he's growing up and becoming ashamed of his past actions. But the novel wouldn't be complete if Burgess hadn't introduced that final bit of irony: after all the State's torturous efforts to \\"reform\\" the poor misguided youth, in the end he just sort of, well, gets over it.<br /><br />Other readers may have different opinions -- and according to Burgess's delightfully snarky introduction of 1986, that's okay with him. And he almost sounds resigned to the fact (for it probably is a fact) that of all his thirty-two novels -- not to mention his nonfiction (including a fine exposition of James Joyce released in the UK as _Here Comes Everybody_ and in the US as _Re Joyce_) and a whole bunch of music -- in the end it's this book for which he will be universally remembered.<br /><br />He may be right that it isn't his best work, and he's undoubtedly right that it's a bit preachy. But it's undoubtedly the book for which I myself will remember him. And I'll make no appy polly loggies for that, O my brothers, for it's a horrorshow book with the impact of an oozy across the glazzies, and no mistake. This malchick and his droogs deserve a place in literary history.	2001-03-30

But anybody who thinks Howard Roark is the \\"projection of an ideal man\\" is kidding himself. He's an interesting character -- one of Rand's most interesting, in fact -- and he serves well to make the one point she wanted him to make (that the ego is the fountainhead of human progress). But he's not an ideal man (even by Rand's own standards, but that's another issue).<br /><br />Rand's _Journals_ indicate that, like Danny Renahan (the \\"hero\\" of the unwritten work _The Little Street_), Roark was supposed to have been \\"born without the ability to consider other people.\\" In ordinary terms, he was a narcissist and a sociopath. And while a good deal of the melodrama in the novel is satisfying within the limited world of the novel itself, nevertheless in real life things would not have worked out this way for Roark. Nor would such a man have been able to design buildings suitable for human habitation.<br /><br />And don't make the mistake Rand encourages you to make (in _The Romantic Manifesto_): imagining what Roark would do as a model for your own behavior. This technique, like the novel itself, shows you only what things look like \\"from the inside\\" to Roark himself -- so it's no help if Roark's vision is limited in the first place.<br /><br />If you want to see such a character \\"from the outside,\\" I highly recommend Paul Theroux's fine novel _The Mosquito Coast_. His \\"protagonist\\" Allie Fox is every bit the genius Roark is, and also every bit as unable to consider other people. Watch what happens to him as seen through the eyes of one of his own children.<br /><br />And if you wouldn't ask yourself what Allie Fox would do, reconsider asking the same question about Roark.	2001-03-30

(I've never been much of a fan of either _1984_ or _Brave New World_, which are usually listed as the top two. And Ayn Rand's annoying novella _Anthem_ is just . . . well, annoying.)<br /><br />It is the tale of a lad named Chip, in a future world in which the great socialist dream has finally been realized. Preferring one person to another is a sign of social maladjustment. &quot;Fight&quot; is a dirty word; &quot;f**k&quot; is just the usual term for an activity no more important than sleeping or urination. Everyone is told what to do by &quot;Uni,&quot; the great computer that organizes society and keeps track of everyone's location via electronic bracelet. (And one of the dirtiest, most maladjusted and antisocial expressions anyone can utter is &quot;Fight Uni.&quot;)<br /><br />There is, in short, no more &quot;juice&quot;: all the oranges are clockwork now. Until . . . ah, but that would spoil things, wouldn't it?<br /><br />So ATLAS SHRUGGED is still chugging along on the best-seller lists, turning unwitting victims into narcissistic misunderstood geniuses -- but this brilliant novel is out of print. What's wrong with this picture?<br /><br />I'm sure glad I still have my old hardcover copy.	2001-03-30

I don't know whether Theroux read Rand or not, but to a reader of her novels, all sorts of little things will look like replies to her.<br /><br />There is, for example, the &quot;Thanksgiving scene,&quot; also wonderfully and subtly brought out in the movie: the family sits down to eat Thanksgiving dinner, hesitates, and begins to eat without giving any thanks. Was Theroux making an oblique ironic comment on a somewhat similar scene in ATLAS SHRUGGED, at which the family of wealthy industrialist Hank Rearden expresses gratitude to everybody under the sun but him?<br /><br />I don't know, but maybe some of Theroux's readers do. At any rate, this novel is a stunningly dark portrait of a maladjusted man, a self-absorbed, twisted genius who fits the description of the Randian hero to a tee. Whether Theroux intended it or not, his portrayal of Allie Fox is an excellent rejoiner to, and corrective of, Rand's own vision of the &quot;ideal man.&quot;	2001-03-30

This volume provides a more in-depth look at Jesus's own teachings and religious practices than did _Jesus the Jew_, and illustrates well that nothing Jesus said or did involved either any departure from Judaism or any attempt to found a new religion separate from Judaism. A fine closing chapter suggests that Christianity might profit by moving closer to the religion _of_ Jesus and abandoning a good deal of the religion _about_ him.<br /><br />On the minus side, a few of Vermes's conclusions are puzzling and probably wrong. For example, he is the only &quot;Jesus scholar&quot; I know of who rejects the parable of the Good Samaritan as &quot;probably inauthentic.&quot; Moreover, in a brief reply to critics who charged that he had provided no account of why Jesus would have been crucified, he argues that Jesus was probably just in the wrong place at the wrong time -- a reply which I find altogether unconvincing and which seems to me to point up some of the weaknesses in Vermes's account.<br /><br />Nevertheless Vermes has pretty much led the way for modern Jews and Christians alike to recognize Jesus as a Jew of his own time. As I said, I'd recommend reading _Jesus the Jew_ first, but if you like Vermes, come back to this one.	2001-03-28

Finally he admitted that she had convinced him. &quot;But,&quot; he added at once, &quot;the Blessed Mother for sure was not!&quot;<br /><br />Well, yes, she was, and so -- of course -- was Jesus himself. This volume, by Jewish scholar Geza Vermes, is probably the single work that did the most to drive this point home to the modern world.<br /><br />There are naturally some difficulties with Vermes's work. One of these is that he relies on Talmudic writings that date, in their written form, from about 500 years later than Jesus; this objection he has dealt with in _Jesus and the World of Judaism_. Another is that he has provided no real reason why his charismatic Galilean hasid should ever have gotten himself crucified; this objection he tries to meet in _The Religion of Jesus the Jew_ (rather lamely and unconvincingly, to my mind; he suggests, at bottom, that Jesus just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time).<br /><br />Then, too, some of his parallels (the main ones being Hanina ben Dosa and Honi the Circle-Drawer) have been questioned for various reasons. Some of these reasons seem cogent to me as well, and I do not think Vermes has provided a _complete_ picture of the historical Jesus.<br /><br />Nevertheless this groundbreaking work is the one that (re)started the conversation in the first place. If Jesus is now recognized by many Jews and Christians alike as having been, as a matter of history, a faithful Jew who in all likelihood did not intend to found a new religion separate from Judaism, this work played a crucial role in bringing that common recognition about.<br /><br />Nor is everything herein merely out of date. Vermes's discussions of -- for example -- the &quot;Son of Man&quot; sayings and the nature of Galilean piety are still cited in the literature, and not always for the purpose of refuting them. Whether complete or not, Vermes's account contains a great deal of truth.<br /><br />At some point anyone trying to cope with the vast array of &quot;Jesus scholarship&quot; of the last three or four decades should get around to reading this absolutely seminal work. _Jesus and the World of Judaism_ is unfortunately out of print as of this writing, but _The Religion of Jesus the Jew_ is also recommended.literature, and not always for the purpose of refuting them.

His exposition and critique will help the newcomer to sort through a bewildering array of theories and sources.<br /><br />I have read almost all of the authors he discusses, and I can say that his presentations of their views are accurate and fair. Frankly, I have never been able to take the &quot;Jesus seminar,&quot; John Dominic Crossan, or Elisabeth Schussler-Fiorenza very seriously, but Witherington manages to do so for just long enough to decimate their theories and methods. And he doesn't seem to be snickering behind his hand while he does it (which is more than I would have been able to manage). Ever the gentleman, the only jest he allows himself at their expense is in the title of his chapter on the &quot;Jesus seminar&quot;: &quot;Jesus the Talking Head.&quot;<br /><br />The other reviews have already listed some of the major scholars whose views he presents. Again, his summaries are thorough and accurate and his criticisms usually well-founded, from the noneschatological, compassion-mongering &quot;spirit person&quot; of Marcus Borg to the slightly-too-eschatological &quot;God's viceroy&quot; of E.P. Sanders, from the Galilean hasid of Geza Vermes to the marginal Jew of John P. Meier. In most cases he finds something (sometimes a very great deal) worth keeping in each scholar's account but takes pains not to _reduce_ the historical Jesus to any one of his aspects.<br /><br />Moreover, he helpfully includes several lesser-known scholars in his overview -- Graham Twelftree, Richard Horsley, R. David Kaylor, and Maurice Casey, for example. Of course it is simply not possible for a single volume to be complete in this respect (and I especially wish he had been able to deal with Stevan Davies's _Jesus the Healer_), but Witherington has managed to compress a great deal of scholarship into a single book.<br /><br />His own view, also presented here, is that Jesus is best viewed as (primarily but not exclusively or reductively) an embodiment of &quot;Wisdom&quot; (chochmah). The reader should refer to Witherington's _Jesus the Sage_ for a more complete presentation of this view (which, to my own admittedly non-Christian mind, has the twin advantages of (a) not rendering Jesus different in kind from other human beings and (b) placing him somewhat correctly within his Jewish context although I personally suspect the nearly-equivalent &quot;embodiment of Torah&quot; might have made slightly better historical-contextual sense).<br /><br />Of course there have been books published since 1995 that are not included here either -- by, for example, Bart Ehrman, Dale Allison, and Paula Fredriksen (whose earlier _From Jesus to Christ_ is also not discussed). However, the reader who has assimilated all of Witherington's material will be well-equipped to deal with these further volumes as well.ingle book.<br /><br />His own view, also presented here, is that Jesus is best viewed as (primarily but not exclusively or reductively) an embodiment of &quot;Wisdom&quot; (chochmah).

This volume is probably his weakest attempt at history, but it is worth reading at least for its remarks on the nature and importance of myth.<br /><br />Maccoby's historical thesis is that the traitorous Judas of the gospels was a sheer invention -- but one nevertheless &quot;spun off&quot; from a real person: the Judas of history was the brother of Jesus. And yes, Maccoby has to perform some remarkable hat tricks in order to pull this off.<br /><br />Whether or not one accepts his historical reconstruction, though, Maccoby has helpful things to say about the role of myth in antisemitism. He does make a strong case that the character of Judas has served (as his name suggests) as a stand-in for the Jews in Christian thought and culture. And he makes some extremely pertinent remarks about the &quot;fundamentalism&quot; of certain writers on the nature of myth (e.g. Rudolf Bultmann, Joseph Campbell), noting well that myths are not beyond criticism either.<br /><br />Not Maccoby's best book, then, but still very much worth reading.	2001-03-26

Thus my interest in learning whether \\"open theism\\" raises cogent alternatives to the traditional view.<br /><br />That view is easily stated; it is that everything, but absolutely everything, occurs by the will of God. According to Calvinism, any _other_ view detracts from . . . well, the Godness of God, so to speak.<br /><br />Now, I could certainly criticize some Calvinists for failing to take this point seriously enough. (For example, there seems to be a foundation here for a sort of \\"Christian satori\\" as one realizes that one simply _can't_ do anything that is not the activity of God -- that, a la Paul's yet-not-I-but-Christ-in-me, one is simply part of the divine activity oneself. I suppose the claim would be that, as one comes to realize and accept this fact fully, one \\"enters the kingdom,\\" conforms one's own will to God's, and tends to stop sinning. And this \\"satori\\" would, of course, be entirely the work of God: some will come to it and some won't, some will like it and some won't, these things all being determined ultimately by the \\"good pleasure of the Father.\\" Now, doesn't that look a lot like salvation by grace through faith?) But short of atheism, it's hard to find reason to disagree with the claim that, ultimately, God just _does_ everything that happens.<br /><br />Nevertheless our authors try mightily to find such reasons. Unfortunately, most of them are not terribly well-founded.<br /><br />Some of the objections are simply raised against the wrong target -- for example, the claim that theistic determinism detracts from God's goodness/love in holding that He consigns people to hell. If I were a Christian, I'd have tried to mount scriptural arguments in favor of annihilationism and/or universalism before I attacked divine sovereignty. But our authors here are neither annihilationists nor universalists; they do think that some people will go to hell, and that they will suffer there eternally.<br /><br />So how does the Arminian position improve on Calvinism? Have we \\"gotten God off the hook\\" by contending that He created both human beings and hell even though He _didn't_ have the power to keep people from eternal punishment? If there is a legitimate target here, surely it is in the doctrine of hell itself, not the doctrine of theistic determinism.<br /><br />The scriptural arguments are not impressive either. There is quite a bit of assertion that certain scriptures seem to show God repenting and/or changing His mind; fair enough. There is also some minor criticism of the view that these passages are analogical or metaphorical; also fair enough. Yet there is no attempt whatsoever to reconcile them any other way -- for example, by arguing that an eternal God, being ultimately outside of time altogether, can perfectly well be timelessly wrathful-toward-Jones-at-time-t1 and merciful-toward-Jones-at-time-t2 without actually undergoing any change _in_ time.<br /><br />Nor are the philosophical arguments much better. I find persistent confusions about what, exactly, \\"free will\\" is supposed to be, together with largely emotion-based \\"arguments\\" that human choice is a sham if we don't actually have such \\"free will.\\" But because nobody bothers offering any account of such \\"free will,\\" it is not carefully distinguished from plain-vanilla _volition_; the casual reader therefore doesn't notice that a form of volition operating outside the causal network altogether would amount to sheer randomness. (Nor is the possibility raised that human volition -- or at least the volition of Christians -- just _is_ the outworking of the divine will. Partakers of the divine nature, indeed! These authors don't seem to take their New Testament very seriously.)<br /><br />Perhaps the best of the bunch is William Lane Craig's piece on Molinism as a possible rapprochement between Calvinism and Arminianism. But even here, Craig seems not to notice that in the relevant respects, his \\"Molinism\\" is not a rapprochement at all; if it is presented consistently, it is Calvinism, plain and simple.<br /><br />There are other errors as well. For example, here as in other \\"open theism\\" writings, our authors wish to persuade us that the idea of an impassible, unchangeable deity comes from Plato and Aristotle _rather than_ from the Bible. This is a false dichotomy; it may well be that Plato and the Bible teach these points in common, and our authors have not successfully shown that the Bible _doesn't_ teach it too. (Moreover, this argument -- including the idea of the \\"divine pathos\\" -- is lifted wholesale from Abraham Joshua Heschel, but as far as I can tell, not one single author in this volume has given him proper credit for it.)<br /><br />Pretty unconvincing, then. Although there are at least a handful of good _expositions_ of the Arminian view, for the most part there is merely a good deal of bandying about of such terms as \\"relational\\" as though these terms (a) have clear meanings and (b) are at somehow at odds with Calvinism.

Nevertheless, when he sticks to his point, he's very, very good.<br /><br />Here he's mostly very, very good. His central message, here as elsewhere, is very simply stated: &quot;you&quot; are not an isolated ego alone with its states and imprisoned in an iron ring of ideas; the boundaries between you and everything else unite as much as they divide; &quot;you&quot; are really the whole megillah, the entire cosmos itself, viewing itself from a certain perspective. Like Douglas Harding, you have no head. Or, as Robert Heinlein's Valentine Michael Smith famously put it, &quot;Thou art God.&quot;<br /><br />And that's _it_. Watts himself used to say that, once you've gotten the message, you should hang up the phone.<br /><br />(Well, that's _almost_ it. There is, of course, all sorts of other stuff in this book as in his others; here, for example, there's a nice exposition of Gregory Bateson's theory of the &quot;double bind.&quot;)<br /><br />Does such nondualism (not &quot;monism&quot;) make you somehow &quot;unreal&quot;? No, but it's easy to see how a reader of Watts might come to this conclusion. For a better exposition of this topic, I refer the reader to the first few chapters of Rabbi Rami Shapiro's _Minyan_, where this nondualistic &quot;teaching&quot; is set out somewhat more pithily and less misleadingly, and with none of the antinomian/irrationalist undertones.	2001-03-26

The received wisdom is that Paul was a Pharisee and Jesus was not. Hyam Maccoby makes a solid case here that the exact reverse is the truth.<br /><br />Maccoby's case about Jesus is made at greater length in _Revolution in Judea_, but there is a chapter here describing Jesus's cordial relationship with the Pharisees. Maccoby further contends, perhaps less plausibly, that the &quot;Ebionites&quot; (&quot;poor ones&quot;) were the group which accurately received and transmitted the traditions of the historical Jesus himself.<br /><br />Maccoby's account of Paul is nothing short of a thorough shredding. If Paul was a trained Pharisee, why don't his arguments have the sound logical structure he should have learned in Pharisee School? Isn't there something a little funny about the way Paul whipped out Roman citizenship papers whenever he got into trouble? And just what _was_ the nature of the famous disagreement between Peter and Paul?<br /><br />Maccoby's Paul was, in short, a cunning rogue who pieced together a new religion from bits of this and that, and then dressed the whole thing up with a sprinkling of out-of-context Torah quotations.<br /><br />I have yet to see a solid reply to most of Maccoby's case. Does he denigrate Paul too far? Perhaps. Does he fail to account adequately for the rise of Christianity? Perhaps. But can we ever read the letters of Paul the same way again after Maccoby has scrutinized them? Undoubtedly not.<br /><br />Agree or disagree, Maccoby's volume makes a strong counterargument to those who, having reclaimed Jesus as a Jew, wish to extend the same courtesy to Paul.

The proper conclusion of this reasoning -- though Rand does not draw it -- is that art is supposed to encourage you to think in words and images instead of ideas. (Don't think through your problems; just imagine &quot;What Would Howard Roark Do.&quot; And don't ask why this technique doesn't work with the sterile, cardboard figure of John Galt.) Why this is supposed to be a _defense_ of &quot;reason in art&quot; is beyond me.<br /><br />In fact it reduces art to its strictly utilitarian purposes -- just like Soviet art, but in the service of Rand's &quot;Objectivist&quot; State rather than the Soviet State. And as the Soviets could smell heresy in Shostakovitch, Rand can smell it in just about everybody other than Mickey Spillane and Ian Fleming.<br /><br />Art may not imitate life, but Rand's theory of art certainly imitates her own life. The upshot of this book is that there must be something wrong with you if you (a) like any artists better than Rand likes them or (b) like any artist better than you like Rand herself. And Rand treated all of her &quot;friends&quot; and acquaintances accordingly.<br /><br />The fact is -- and it _is_ an objective, rationally intelligible fact -- that how you respond to an artist depends a good deal on your own _subjective_ (not &quot;arbitrary&quot;: subjective) tastes and capacities. It does not reduce to a simple matter of &quot;style,&quot; as though everybody who enjoys the Impressionists (whom, incidentally, Rand seems to think were pointillists) has a murky, anti-cognitive &quot;sense of life&quot; and everybody who enjoys Beethoven (which I don't) has a sort of ominous feeling about the &quot;malevolent&quot; universe.<br /><br />This stuff is nothing but rationalization -- rationalization of why Rand's doorstop (excuse me; &quot;novel&quot;) ATLAS SHRUGGED didn't receive widespread critical acclaim, and rationalization of why other people didn't respond to real artists with the same sort of heresy-sniffing emotionalism Rand herself did.

In this more in-depth sequel to _The Mythmaker_, Hyam Maccoby continues to mount his case that Paul was not a Pharisee at all but something of a rogue who patched together a new religion out of Gnostic elements and a superficial smattering of Torah quotes.<br /><br />One of the highlights of this volume is Maccoby's analysis of Paul's claim to have received his information on the &quot;Lord's supper&quot; by direct revelation rather than from any of the apostles. There may be treatments of this topic that respond adequately to Maccoby's claims, but I have not seen them.<br /><br />Another highlight is a full-chapter rebuttal of the well-intended but arguably wrongheaded views of Lloyd Gaston, John Gager, and Krister Stendhal, who think Paul was merely offering a new way of salvation to non-Jews but didn't really mean to supersede the Torah for Jews. Here again, I do not know of any adequate reply to Maccoby's merciless dissection of this claim.<br /><br />Maccoby is also the author of _Revolution in Judea_, highly recommended as well. If either of these books returns to print (or any of Maccoby's other out-of-print books, for that matter), grab them at once.	2001-03-21

Essentially, Rand castigates philosophers for having failed to solve the &quot;problem of universals&quot; and therefore having failed to defend the efficacy of the human mind. Baaaaad philosophers. Ah, but Rand herself will fix things, as soon as she gets around to writing her big book on &quot;Objectivism.&quot;<br /><br />Well, she never did get around to writing that big book, but she did write a small one that was supposed to deal with the &quot;problem of universals&quot; and introduce the &quot;Objectivist&quot; theory of concepts. It was, and is, called _Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology_ -- and it not only doesn't solve the &quot;problem of universals,&quot; it doesn't even state it correctly. (Nor does she stick to her own proposed &quot;solution&quot; for even the length of her opening chapter.) Some of Rand's non-fiction essays weren't bad; a handful of them were even very good. But her attempts at philosophy were uniformly ill-informed, illogical, and based almost entirely on the power of her rhetoric.<br /><br />&quot;For The New Intellectual&quot; is _all_ rhetoric -- but the reader who is skeptical that &quot;Objectivism&quot; stands or falls with ITOE should read it as evidence. Rand herself is clear, both here and in ITOE (as well as in some of her private writings, published posthumously), that she thinks philosophy is fundamentally epistemology and that her pseudo-solution to the &quot;problem of universals&quot; is the _raison d'etre_ of &quot;Objectivism.&quot; Make no mistake, her theory of concepts _is_ the basic subject matter of &quot;Objectivism&quot; -- and her theory of concepts is dead wrong. I leave the conclusion as an exercise for the reader.<br /><br />For anything _other_ than historical interest, check out a real philosopher instead. Brand Blanshard actually did the things some of Rand's readers think Rand herself did -- e.g., defend reason at a time when it was unpopular -- and he didn't debase our understanding of &quot;reason&quot; in the process.epts _is_ the basic subject matter of &quot;Objectivism&quot; -- and her theory of concepts is dead wrong.

She also had the sense to include a shortlist of recommended reading, which she had never done before and never did again.<br /><br />So we can forgive this book some of its antilibertarian, statist flaws: for example, her defense of &quot;big business&quot; as &quot;America's most persecuted minority&quot; (Murray Rothbard had a few chuckles over this); her thoroughly statist account of &quot;The Nature of Government&quot; and her oracular dismissal of anarchocapitalism; her undermining of the Second Amendment by declaring that government needs a monopoly on the power of coercion (the whole point of the federalist system is to _avoid_ such a monopoly, though perhaps Russian immigrants don't always grasp this point); her insistence that the American commonwealth was based on the (also statist) philosophy of Aristotle (when in fact it owed a great deal more to John Calvin, though Calvin himself might have been surprised to hear it).<br /><br />In fact, forget her own positive account altogether; her philosophy itself was almost uniformly rhetorical-polemical nonsense. But she had a fine knack for picking apart the arguments of some of the _opponents_ of capitalism, and there's quite a bit of that in this volume.<br /><br />And her bibliography will introduce you to Ludwig von Mises. For _that_, we can forgive her a lot.	2001-03-21

(Spinoza comes in, for example, for a little gentle ribbing on the question whether anyone can achieve blessedness without relying on Scripture. Mason suggests in a parenthetical comment that Spinoza may have thought he and Jesus were the only two people who could do so.)<br />Overall, this volume is an excellent exposition of Spinoza's thought about God and religion -- and it has some very interesting features. For one thing, there's a full chapter devoted to figuring out just what Spinoza thought of Jesus -- a much-neglected topic. For another, there's _another_ full chapter devoted to figuring out just what Spinoza meant by the eternality of the mind.<br />I find Mason very congenial on many points. For my money he outdoes both Edwin Curley _and_ Jonathan Bennett on some topics -- especially Spinoza's views on the nature of necessity. He also beats the heck out of Yovel on Spinoza's relations to religion. And at one point he offers a gentle corrective to nineteenth-century-idealistic readings of Spinoza (especially Joachim), arguing that Spinoza did think it was possible to know things short of the Absolute. (I think, by the way, that this is both correct and entirely consonant with idealism as it should be understood; in my view the British neo-Hegelians were a bit vulnerable on this point.)<br />Some readers may like his approach and its conclusion: that there isn't any point to digging around behind Spinoza's words looking for theological secrets; Spinoza meant just what he wrote. (Which means, among other things, that he wasn't trying either to found a new religion or to undermine any existing ones.) Straussians will disagree, of course, but frankly there seems to be little reason to apply persecution-and-the-art-of-writing standards to Spinoza's writings.<br />A nice addition to everyone's home Spinoza library.	2001-03-21

Maccoby's positive case is mostly very good and he excels at locating Jesus's words and deeds within the Pharisee movement of his time. But some of his more speculative reconstructions are . . . well, speculative.<br /><br />Nevertheless Maccoby is at his strongest in getting straight just what the \\"kingdom\\" would have meant to Jesus and his hearers. Bottom line: Jesus expected God to intervene in history, and part of the result would be the end of Roman rule in the Holy Land. Thus Jesus's appeal to Zealots and revolutionaries -- and thus also an explanation for what some other historians (Paula Fredriksen, for example) have found so confusing: that the Roman authorities didn't come after Jesus's followers too. (It was sufficient to execute Jesus himself as an example.)<br /><br />Too bad this book is out of print. It really belongs alongside E.P. Sanders's _Jesus and Judaism_ -- another book that goes a long way toward clearing up misinformation about Jesus's relationship to his own religion.	2001-03-21

I can't possibly do justice either to his drawing style or his either-you-get-it-or-you-don't sense of things. Here's an example: one cartoon features a simple-looking fellow sitting in front of a sign that says &quot;No Standing,&quot; while a car runs over his legs. The caption reads: &quot;Steady as a rock, and twice as smart.&quot;<br /><br />Read this book too many times and you will find yourself saying such things to your friends. Worse, you may find yourself _choosing_ your friends based on whether they understand you when you say things like, &quot;Sweet Jesus, this is no simple trek to the north forty!&quot; It may actually put you off when someone fails to pick up on your passing reference to the priest with a suspicious case of rugburn-on-the-knee, or doesn't know what you're talking about when you characterize someone as &quot;The Happy Guy.&quot; Well, into each night some days must fall, and sometimes you're just too tired to climb the walls.<br /><br />If this collection ever comes back into print, buy it at once. Otherwise you'll be -- as another of Duffy's cartoons puts it -- missing the humor in everyday life. In the meantime, go buy everything of Kliban's that's still available.	2001-03-21

Meynell mounts an argument for the existence of God as an explanation for the intelligibility of the world.<br /><br />This argument is not the same as the recent (though also interesting) case for &quot;intelligent design&quot; mounted by William Dembski. Meynell's case is more general, and applies even in the absence of any evidence of such design (though of course such design is consistent with his thesis).<br /><br />Meynell argues, basically, that (a) it is ultimately incoherent to take the &quot;real world&quot; to be anything other than what we get to know by right reason, and that (b) the existence of a necessarily-existing intelligent Creator is the best explanation for the intelligibility of that &quot;real world.&quot; My short summary does not do it justice, but those are the (very) bare bones of his cosmological argument.<br /><br />Meynell's exposition is extremely thorough. He begins by considering, and curtly dismissing, the common claim that arguments for God's existence are unimportant. He then spends a chapter considering standard arguments and counter-arguments for God's existence before setting forth his own argument.<br /><br />The meat of that argument is in chapter three, in which he argues at length for the claim I have summarized briefly above: that the &quot;real world&quot; is an intelligible, coherent system which we come to understand through the proper use of reason. Chapter four then passes to God as an explanation for such intelligibility.<br /><br />Meynell then closes with a cleanup chapter of &quot;paralipomena&quot; (&quot;things left out&quot; of the discussion to that point) and a two-page conclusion summarizing his argument. An appendix deals with A.J. Ayer's arguments against theistic belief in _The Central Questions of Philosophy_.<br /><br />Meynell does not deal with the &quot;presuppositionalist&quot; view that all such arguments are question-begging, but it must be acknowledged that, strictly speaking, his argument is not _deductively_ valid. However, it does not need to be; what he is actually doing is setting out the absolute, axiomatic presuppositions of reason itself -- and this process is not deduction. (A full reply to the presuppositionalists on this point would take us rather far afield, but we may note briefly that the presuppositionalist argument collapses all reasoning into deductive logic -- a move I do not find terribly credible.)<br /><br />I could probably manage to disagree with Meynell here and there if I tried. For example, he is at great pains to make clear that his view does not amount to &quot;idealism,&quot; but here I think he is relying on a more restrictive view of &quot;idealism&quot; than I would prefer to take. (Nicholas Rescher remarks somewhere that any philosophy denying the existence of unknowable things-in-themselves not susceptible to reason is at bottom a form of idealism; I concur. Meynell seems to be rejecting only _subjective_ idealism, a rejection in which I happily join him.)<br /><br />Be that as it may, overall this is _the_ best book I know on the argument to an intelligent God from the existence and axiomatic efficacy of human reason.

Allan Farnsworth, Reporter for the Restatement (Second) of Contracts and the author of a three-volume treatise on contracts (the student edition of which is also _very_ highly recommended), here tries to make sense of the legal principles that govern whether or not you can change your mind.<br /><br />Of course most of the work has to do with contract law, but Farnsworth spreads outward into other fields as needed -- into tort law, for example, to discuss whether you can \\"change your mind\\" once you have decided to come to the aid of someone whose life is in danger.<br /><br />The organization is straightforward. Farnsworth begins by examining why our promises, etc., should be binding in the first place and devotes roughly the first half of the book to discussing the various reasons why we might _want_ to bind our future decisions. Then he devotes the second half to expounding the principles that determine whether or not we _are_ thus bound. (The classification scheme here is his own; it heavily overlaps but is not simply identical with the set of principles you learned, or will learn, in your contracts class. He also discusses the points at which current law does not seem subject to such rationalization and makes some suggestions for improvement.)<br /><br />The exposition is clear and crisp, the writing is free of legalese, and many of the cases will be familiar from contract and tort casebooks. This book therefore makes a fine companion to first-year law hornbooks.<br /><br />Grab the student edition of Farnsworth's contracts book while you're at it. I use Calamari first to get essential principles, then turn to Farnsworth for elaboration.	2001-03-20

Some of them have actually thought carefully about the issue, and some of them are merely Objectivists who have accepted Ayn Rand's oracular dismissal of anarchocapitalism in her (thoroughly statist) essay on &quot;The Nature of Government.&quot; Both of these groups will benefit from a reading of Bruce Benson's fine volume.<br /><br />Benson picks up the argument where Murray Rothbard and David Friedman left it, and carries it forward by several miles. Here he provides a short history of market-based law, from its rise to its near-demise at the hands of &quot;authoritarian&quot; law; a public-choice analysis of the political market for law; an overview of recent trends toward reliance on private sources of law and justice; rebuttals of common arguments for the necessity of State law; and a short summary of what a private, non-State system of law might look like.<br /><br />There are treats throughout. Some of my favorites are Benson's replies to Landes and Posner -- e.g. their argument that &quot;private&quot; law is parasitic on legal standards developed in the public sector, and their claim that such &quot;private&quot; law would be less efficient than public law. (In general I am of the opinion that Richard Posner is one of the most overrated legal thinkers of the past century or two.)<br /><br />Benson is also exceptional among libertarian writers in his familiarity with the relevant legal literature. One of the other exceptions -- the altogether brilliant Randy Barnett (whose book _The Structure of Liberty_ belongs on your shelf next to this one) -- is credited by Benson for drawing the latter's attention to such literature and making some specific recommendations. The result, however achieved, is something all but unheard of in the libertarian world: a volume on liberty that actually acknowledges the existence of such legal theorists as Lon Fuller.<br /><br />That's a nice feature in a book on law. I would like to see Benson's book (and its excellent sequel, _To Serve and Protect_) read by both libertarians and lawyers, and I'm happy he's written a book that the latter group won't toss away in disgust at the childish ignorance of the author. We have enough of those books already (and I think Rand wrote or influenced most of them).<br /><br />In general, the more people that read this book, the better. If nothing else, this book will shake an assumption that badly needs shaking: that there must be a State in order for there to be law.<br /><br />(By the way, you'll find Benson referring occasionally to George H. Smith's fine essay, &quot;Justice Entrepreneurship in a Free Market.&quot; Originally published in the _Journal of Libertarian Studies_, that essay is reprinted in _Atheism, Ayn Rand, and Other Heresies_.)t's a nice feature in a book on law.

As is typical of Rothbard, the whole is presented with clarity, rigor, and wit.<br /><br />Readers who like what they find here may want to go on to Ludwig von Mises's _Theory of Money and Credit_ -- which Rothbard describes somewhere as the best book ever on monetary theory.	2001-03-19

John Martin Fischer has here collected the major rounds of this dialogue into a single volume and added a helpful introduction.<br />The contents include Fischer's introduction and Pike's 1965 paper, together with the following:<br />Marilyn McCord Adams, \\"Is the Existence of God a 'Hard' Fact?\\"<br />John Martin Fischer, \\"Freedom and Foreknowledge\\"<br />David Widerker, \\"Two Forms of Fatalism\\"<br />Eddy Zemach and David Widerker, \\"Facts, Freedom, and Foreknowledge\\"<br />Joshua Hoffman and Gary Rosenkrantz, \\"Hard and Soft Facts\\"<br />Alfred J.

Alston, \\"Divine Foreknowledge and Alternative Conceptions of Human Freedom\\"<br />Martin Davies, \\"Boethius and Others on Divine Foreknowledge\\"<br />I shall not try to summarize the arguments of these various papers. The reader should be aware, however, that the papers collected in this volume address Pike's claim, and argument, that God's _foreknowledge_ is not compatible with human freedom. The scope of this work does not extend to the question whether God's _causation_ of all events is thus compatible.<br />If you buy this book, be prepared for a lot of technical argumentation and modal analysis and that sort of thing. These essays are highly readable -- their authors are all able writers -- but they will probably not be terribly accessible to a reader with no background in philosophy.	2001-03-18

Michael LaFargue says the Tao Te Ching is the former even though it's often treated as the latter.<br /><br />According to LaFargue (my paraphrase), there are two ways to read the Tao Te Ching, just as there are two ways to read any text.<br /><br />The first -- the one taken by any number of readers of Lao-Tzu, including some &quot;translators&quot; whom LaFargue doesn't name and I won't either -- is to point your face at it and sort of see how it makes you, like, _feel_, you know?<br /><br />The second, and the one LaFargue favors, is to place the text in the context for which it was written and try to understand what its writer or speaker would have intended by it.<br /><br />This is the approach LaFargue uses in order to produce his excellent (and thoroughly annotated and cross-referenced) translation of the Tao Te Ching. He also, in an extremely helpful essay on hermeneutics, discusses this approach at length and explains the context in which he believes the text to have been written.<br /><br />I won't try to discuss every topic he covers, but one extremely helpful point is his identification of much of the text as what he calls &quot;compensatory wisdom.&quot; On his view, some of the Tao Te Ching's pithy sayings are intended not as metaphysical speculation but only as counters to contrary human tendencies. (When we say that &quot;a watched pot never boils,&quot; we surely do not mean that if you sit there and watch a pot, it will literally _never_ boil. We are merely warning against a common tendency to rush things that can't be rushed.)<br /><br />This seems to me to be right on the money, and indeed to be pretty widely applicable to Oriental religious literature including the Bible. It is the right way, for example, to read the book of Proverbs, and some of Jesus's sayings from the Christian New Testament as well.<br /><br />LaFargue's volume, then, may be of interest both to readers of Lao-Tzu and to readers of the Jewish and Christian Bibles. In discussions of &quot;biblical inerrancy&quot; and such, it is too often forgotten that the Bible is ancient Near Eastern literature and therefore not written to modern Western European standards. Inerrantists and religious &quot;liberals&quot; alike could surely profit from greater appreciation of this point; many apparent contradictions just disappear (and so do some theological creeds) once we understand that the text isn't _always_ offering us metaphysical principles.<br /><br />In any event, widespread reading of LaFargue's book might spare us another spate of ill-considered screeds on &quot;the Tao of&quot; this, that, and the other thing. What a relief that would be.ons of &quot;biblical inerrancy&quot; and such, it is too often forgotten that the Bible is ancient Near Eastern literature and therefore not written to modern Western European standards.

But then again, it's also one of his thickest and most demanding.<br /><br />Essentially, his thesis is that all human religions are (as his subtitle indicates) human responses to a transcendent reality which (or Who) &quot;has many names,&quot; as another of his book titles puts it. On this view, the measure of a religion's &quot;success&quot; is its ability to move people along the path of salvation/liberation/call it what you will.<br /><br />Now, there are tremendous difficulties with this view, and Hick does not duck them; that's one reason the book is so thick. I won't try to summarize his arguments here; readers who want shorter and more accessible discussions can turn to one of his other books for a good introduction. At any rate he sorts carefully through a bewildering array of &quot;responses to the transcendent&quot; and tries, mostly successfully, to sort them into some sort of pattern despite their occasional apparent contradictions of one another. (At bottom he relies on a Kantian distinction between the noumenal and the phenomenal to argue for the existence of a single transcendent Reality not exhausted in human conceptions thereof.)<br /><br />What I find most interesting about his attempt is that the outcome is very close to the view of mainstream Judaism. Judaism has never claimed to be a universal religion; on the traditional Jewish view, all people (and peoples) have their own particular spiritual strengths and weaknesses, with the Jews in this sense being only one people among others. Nor are all of the mitzvot (commandments) universal and &quot;objective&quot; in the full sense: there is not, for example, anything inherently unclean about pork; it's just that Jews are forbidden to eat it. (Breaking the kosher laws is &quot;malum prohibitum,&quot; not &quot;malo in se.&quot; Certain foods are said to be &quot;unclean for you,&quot; not unclean in themselves.)<br /><br />Moreover, Judaism's major philosophers have long held that God &quot;in Himself,&quot; the Ein Sof, is not directly knowable (at least through anything short of mystical insight) although His &quot;attributes&quot; may be. Here again, some people (and peoples) are better equipped than others to deal with this or that particular attribute, but no one party or group has the full scoop; the arrangement is one of interdependence, not of everybody-follow-the-leader.<br /><br />So whatever disagreements I may have with this or that point in Hick's massive work, I agree wholeheartedly with the spirit of it and recommend it to any reader interested in the nature and purpose of &quot;religion.&quot; There is a real, deep problem as to whether a religious believer can acknowledge the existence and even &quot;validity&quot; (a much overused word) of other faiths without simply folding them into one's own. Hick tackles the question with great intellectual vigor.<br /><br />I must also note, however, that his monumental effort still leaves out, or deals inadequately with, a couple of major approaches. One of these is philosophy itself, which at its best has also been conceived as a &quot;religion&quot; in the sense Hick requires. (I would particularly have enjoyed seeing Hick deal with both Spinozism and Idealism.) Oh, well; not everything will fit into one book.that Jews are forbidden to eat it.

But Christians may well be concerned about that, and the previous reviewer is quite right to warn about it. (So why all those &quot;not helpful&quot; votes? Are there any Christians who _don't_ find such warnings helpful?)<br /><br />On the other hand, I'm not persuaded that de Mello _is_ taking anything out of context. There is a loooooooooooong tradition in Christianity, is there not, of recognizing that even Jesus's most casual words are charged with hidden spiritual significance and trying to discern their &quot;inner&quot; meaning through meditation?<br /><br />Be that as it may, the reader should be aware that this is not a book &quot;about&quot; Christianity or Christian theology or biblical hermeneutics or anything else of the sort. De Mello has exactly one purpose in writing, and he isn't messing around: as he remarks in _Awareness_, imitating Christ doesn't make you Christlike any more than playing a saxophone makes a monkey a musician. &quot;You've got,&quot; de Mello says, &quot;to _be_ Christ.&quot; And the entire purpose of the short meditations in this little volume is precisely to make you &quot;_be_ Christ.&quot;<br /><br />Heresy? Well, as a non-Christian I'm not an authority on whom you should rely here -- but as I recall, the New Testament does say that Christians are supposed to &quot;have the mind of Christ&quot; and &quot;be transformed by the renewing of your mind.&quot;<br /><br />For de Mello, God is a lot more interested in our transformation than in our &quot;worship,&quot; and He probably isn't too bothered by the possibility that somebody may quote a couple of gospel sentences out of context in helping us to be thus transformed. De Mello thinks this transformation is a _lot_ more important than saying &quot;Lord, Lord&quot; and having one's theological/exegetical ducks in a row.<br /><br />And for de Mello, this transformation is achieved through insight -- insight into reality itself and into the nature of the bad &quot;programming&quot; that keeps us from noticing that we don't need anything else in order to be happy.<br /><br />Disagree? Get in line; I have plenty of disagreements with him myself. And there is probably no reader in the world, Christian or otherwise, who will find nothing to disagree with in de Mello's sometimes infuriating writings. He doesn't care; he likes our disagreement just fine, so long as we are _responding_ rather than just &quot;reacting.&quot;<br /><br />This little book, like all of de Mello's writings, is mighty potent. Whether for good or for evil, you decide.xegetical ducks in a row.<br /><br />And for de Mello, this transformation is achieved through insight -- insight into reality itself and into the nature of the bad &quot;programming&quot; that keeps us from noticing that we don't need anything else in order to be happy.<br /><br />Disagree?

And I still think this is probably his best book.<br /><br />It is not, as Smullyan himself notes, a book _about_ Chinese philosophy, so don't buy it as an introduction to Taoism. (Probably the best overall such introduction, at least to &quot;philosophical Taoism,&quot; is Alan Watts's _The Way of Zen_. Smullyan is a fan of Watts, by the way, and I agree with him that _Cloud-Hidden, Whereabouts Unknown_ was one of Watts's best books.) Smullyan is not giving an exposition of Eastern religion or philosophy here, although he does include a helpful bibliography for anyone who wants to follow up on that topic. (In fact some of his best essays have at least marginally to do with _Western_ religion.)<br /><br />This book is a series of essays and reflections _inspired_ by Chinese philosophy -- in particular, inspired by an American mathematical logician's _reading_ of Chinese philosophy. And Smullyan is a delightfully witty and graceful writer, with a vivid sense of (for example) the foolishness of much modern &quot;education,&quot; the meaning of &quot;discipline,&quot; and the limits of abstract formal logic (which, incidentally, is _not_ identical with &quot;reason&quot;).<br /><br />Not only that, but he is one of few recent writers to explore the &quot;dialogue&quot; as a form of philosophical exposition. One of his finest is in this volume: &quot;Is God a Taoist?&quot; (This one is guaranteed to annoy all the right people.)<br /><br />The Tao may be silent, but Smullyan, thank goodness, is not. His deft logic, his light touch, and his genial humor will endear him to pretty much any reader, of any religious or philosophical orientation, who approaches the book with an active mind.<br /><br />(And I do mean &quot;any.&quot; I have known the occasional reader who takes Smullyan to be an enemy of religious &quot;orthodoxy,&quot; but I frankly see nothing here that justifies that view. More likely somebody is just misunderstanding what &quot;orthodoxy&quot; really is.)<br /><br />Very highly recommended.

How about the ones that tell us the New Testament canon is historically useless, but the gospel of Thomas provides reliable insights into the esoteric Buddhist teachings Jesus learned during his lost years in India or Tibet? Or how about the ones that tell us Jesus never existed in the first place, or the ones entitled &quot;Jesus the ________&quot; (fill in the blank with your favorite) that tell us the key to understanding him is to interpret/reduce all his words and deeds according to the item we filled in the blank with?<br /><br />Really? Me too.<br /><br />You'll get none of that from E.P. Sanders. This book is, for my money, _the_ best single volume currently available on the historical Jesus. (It may be the most readable, too. I taught a short course out of it five or six years ago and we all had an easy time with Sanders's clear, crisp expository prose.)<br /><br />Sanders's view is that we actually have quite a bit of information on Jesus -- not, perhaps, as much as we might like and not in as much detail as we would probably prefer, but quite a bit all the same. And in this book, he sorts through it carefully and summarizes what he thinks we can know on the subject.<br /><br />He is careful with his evidence and doesn't put too much weight on any single item. For example, he is doubtful that we can learn much from the &quot;titles&quot; Jesus supposedly applied to himself, partly because it's awfully hard to tell whether he _did_ apply them, and partly because even if he did so, we'd still have to determine exactly what _he_ meant by them. Either way, we have to look at the broad outlines of Jesus's life and career, so that's just what Sanders does.<br /><br />And he is eminently well qualified to do it. Sanders is of course the author of _Jesus and Judaism_, a delightful work that utterly demolishes popular and scholarly misconceptions about Jesus's relationship to Judaism; his work on the Judaism of the Second Temple period is well known and well regarded. In this volume he puts all of that work to good use and carefully locates Jesus within the Judaism of his time.<br /><br />His conclusion is that Jesus understood himself to be acting in some manner in God's stead -- as God's &quot;viceroy,&quot; Sanders puts it using his own preferred term, since Jesus regarded God Himself as &quot;King.&quot; For Sanders's Jesus, the &quot;kingdom&quot; was partly a present and partly a future affair; Jesus expected God to do something novel in the relatively near future, and he thought he himself was in some manner its harbinger, even to the point of being able to offer a place in the &quot;kingdom&quot; to sinners who had repented but not fully returned to the observance of Mosaic law. His actions in the Temple were a prophetic demonstration of the coming kingdom, and it was this action that led to his execution by crucifixion.<br /><br />All in all, a refreshingly sane historical account (although I personally think it de-emphasizes the &quot;political&quot; character of Jesus's words and deeds just a wee bit _too_ much). And it concludes with an appendix in which Sanders looks over the accounts of the &quot;resurrection appearances,&quot; recognizes that they can't be harmonized, concludes that these appearances were in some way historical, and admits candidly that he doesn't know exactly what happened though he's convinced that something did.<br /><br />The entire volume, then, is a solid piece of historical inquiry -- neither making too much stew from one oyster in the manner of those who seize on a single word or phrase and make it the key to everything else, nor erring on the side of skepticism in the manner of those who forget that in some respects we have much better historical sources for Jesus than we have for, say Julius Caesar. Highly recommended both in its own right andas an antidote to quite a bit of Third-Quest lunacy.as an antidote to quite a bit of Third-Quest lunacy.	2001-03-12

I don't mean to imply my full agreement with his approach in general or with his interpretations in particular -- but on the other hand I think he's done a wonderful job overall.<br /><br />Oh, there are one or two minor problems. For example, Leong consistently identifies &quot;rationality&quot; with abstract, &quot;left-brain&quot; activity and insists that (in this sense) truth and reality are mysteries to the &quot;rational&quot; mind. But that this is not the whole story is indicated even by his own writing, in which he tries carefully to follows Jesus's &quot;logic&quot; and employs inference freely. I'd really enjoy seeing one of these Zen books take a crack at improving our _understanding_ of rationality rather than just dismissing &quot;reason&quot; as inadequate.<br /><br />Then, too, Leong occasionally makes references to the &quot;Pharisees&quot; that have little foundation in the actual history of the Perushim. In fact there is a good case to be made that, historically, Jesus was closely aligned with the Pharisees himself (and indeed most of his teachings can be paralleled from within the Jewish tradition of his time).<br /><br />But as far as the teachings themselves are concerned, on the whole Leong does a nice job of presenting and explicating them. There is a good deal of truth in his presentation and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />I especially recommend it to readers of Stephen Mitchell's _The Gospel According to Jesus_, which I've just recently reviewed. Mitchell, while acknowledging that his translation may have omitted passages whose light he hasn't been able to see, nevertheless proceeds to leave out ninety percent of the material in the synoptic gospels (to say nothing of John). And Mitchell expressly takes Thomas Jefferson as his example in hacking the gospels to pieces.<br /><br />By contrast, Leong writes as follows [p. 195]: &quot;Before writing this book, I agreed with Thomas Jefferson that parts of the New Testament 'have proceeded from an extraordinary man; and other parts are of the fabric of very inferior minds.' For a long time, I have shared with many scholars and intellectuals the opinion that the words of Jesus have been tampered with and his central teachings distorted to serve the purpose of the religious establishment. But . . . it seems that the suspicion of foul play has to be reconsidered.&quot;<br /><br />In consequence, Leong leaves in nearly everything Mitchell leaves out, and thus provides a much more rounded presentation of Jesus's words and deeds. Mitchell tosses out what he does not understand; Leong has the intellectual and spiritual humility to recognize that there may be more to a passage than he has understood, and therefore keeps digging until he _does_ reach some understanding of it.<br /><br />Another result is that there is nothing in this volume that expressly interferes with or contradicts more mainstream views of Jesus (or so it seems to me; I am not a Christian myself, so please treat my opinion accordingly). Theoretically, it appears, a theologically conservative Christian could retain all of his or her present views about the nature of Jesus and simply use Leong's book as a guide to understanding his teachings. This, too, is a nice contrast to Mitchell's book, which -- while explicitly dedicating itself to both &quot;believers and unbelievers&quot; -- rather smugly bases itself almost entirely on views that professing Christians can only regard as unbelief.<br /><br />At any rate, Leong's presentation succeeds quite well on its own terms. His topics range from the nature of Zen to Jesus's use of humor and the dangers of &quot;scapegoating,&quot; and he is always both clear and interesting. He closes with a salutary warning not to regard his own conclusions as final and with the hope that he has helped to provide something of a new &quot;paradigm&quot; for reading scripture.<br />His work should thus appeal to a broad audience in general, and in particular it should be of great interest to readers of the rest of the &quot;Christian Zen&quot; literature (e.g. William Johnston, Dom Aelred Graham, Robert Kennedy).ing scripture.<br />His work should thus appeal to a broad audience in general, and in particular it should be of great interest to readers of the rest of the &quot;Christian Zen&quot; literature (e.g. William Johnston, Dom Aelred Graham, Robert Kennedy).	2001-03-11

The reader unfamiliar with Spinoza but possessing some background in philosophy may prefer to start with this volume rather than with Scruton's, although on the whole I still like Scruton's a little better.<br />In just ninety-three pages, Steinberg covers the gamut of Spinoza's thought. She devotes an introductory chapter to a short account of his life, and then dedicates a chapter each to his metaphysics, his views of mind and body, his psychology, his ethics, and his philosophical methodology. The presentation is solid and tight.<br />One advantage over Scruton's older introduction, by the way, is that Steinberg has taken into account certain more recent works on Spinoza -- including material from the conferences at the Jerusalem Spinoza Institute of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (edited by Yirmiyahu Yovel), and the disagreement between Jonathan Bennett and Edwin Curley about the exact nature of \\"attributes\\" and \\"modes\\" in Spinoza's thought. (This is also the sort of thing I have in mind when I say Steinberg's introduction is a bit more technical than Scruton's, so the advantage may be a disadvantage for some readers.)<br />On the whole, then, this well-executed little book is a welcome addition to the recent Spinoza literature.<br />However, through (I assume) no fault of the author's, it suffers from some stupendously poor editing/proofreading. The widespread use of word-processing software has made possible an entirely new class of typographical error, and it seems that the folks at Wadsworth haven't quite caught up.<br />For example, on a quick skim through the book, I found four or five places in which a double hyphen hasn't been properly replaced by an em-dash. More seriously, the bottom half of p. 22 is left blank for no good reason -- not, one presumes, because there is any text missing, but because there is a page break in the text at this point that somebody forgot to delete. And on the bottom of p. 47, we find the first seven words of a boldface section heading: \\"Substance Monism and the Doctrine of Mode.\\" The last word -- \\"Identity\\" -- is stranded alone at the top of p. 48, where the new section actually begins.<br />(There are also a handful of minor misspellings, mostly in the textual citations from Spinoza: \\"th\\" for \\"the,\\" \\"bu\\" for \\"but,\\" and so forth. And I won't list the occasional grammatical oddities that appear here and there throughout the text.)<br />Let's hope Wadsworth corrects this stuff in future editions of the book.

Emptiness upon emptiness!&quot; Qoheleth as a quasi-Taoist sage, warning us of the impermanence of everything?<br /><br />Absolutely. And as a matter of fact I agreed in principle with Rabbi Rami Shapiro's rendering before I even read it. There is strong support for his interpretation, and naturally he presents some of it in this book.<br /><br />The book itself consists of one of Rabbi Shapiro's typically lucid introductions, the text of his also typically lucid rendering of the book of Qoheleth itself, and a series of homiletic essays on various practical topics.<br /><br />As always, Rabbi Shapiro recommends reading his rendering in parallel with a more traditional (and literal) translation; his text is meant as a supplement, not a replacement. In fact he expands greatly on the terse text of Qoheleth, sometimes turning a short verse or two into a full-page improvisation. And as usual, I have nothing but praise for the simple and transparent quality of his poetic prose.<br /><br />(Incidentally, any Christians reading Rabbi Shapiro's marvelous work may want to examine closely the epistle of James, which is rightly regarded as the &quot;most Jewish&quot; book of the canonical New Testament and in my view admits of a very similar reading. &quot;What are you? You are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes.&quot;)<br /><br />And I like Rabbi Shapiro's warnings about &quot;telling ourselves stories&quot; in our attempts to make sense of the &quot;world&quot; in our _own_ terms. I think he successfully point up some of the hazards in what I would call &quot;false rationalism.&quot;<br /><br />The &quot;rationalism&quot; that confuses the present contents of one's one explicit, conscious thoughts with ultimate reality itself is the sort of thing Michael Oakeshott had in mind in his essay &quot;Rationalism in Politics,&quot; and in my view it is not rationalism at all (except perhaps in a debased, &quot;modern&quot; sense that has little foundation in traditional religion and philosophy). Reality does not need our help in order to become rationally articulated; and it makes sense on its own terms, not _necessarily_ on ours.<br /><br />My point: Rabbi Shapiro is _not_ mounting a case here for a sort of fuzzy, anti-intellectual, logic-bashing, feelgood pseudo-religion. He is opposing, not reason and intellect, but rationalization and intellectualism (and see the works of Ayn Rand for lots of examples).<br /><br />I mention this because I occasionally run into people who have read books like this one and seem to think they are &quot;enlightened&quot; when they are really just intellectually lazy.

He has an uncanny skill for \\"listening\\" his way into a text and saying what it \\"wants\\" to say in clear, simple, English poetry/prose. Which means I think well of the positive portions of his translations of Genesis, the Psalms, the book of Job, and (in this book) the Christian New Testament.<br /><br />I also like parts of his commentary. Here, too, he is remarkably adept at adducing pertinent parallels among at least the mystical strands of various religions and \\"wisdom traditions.\\" More often than not, I find his lucid comments useful and even enlightening (and, incidentally, less far from, or at least less irreconcilable with, the religious \\"mainstream\\" than he sometimes thinks they are).<br /><br />But boy, when it comes to scholarship . . .<br /><br />In the present volume Mitchell isn't content to rely on mainstream liberal-Christian scholars like E.P. Sanders. No, he further relies on the risible \\"scholarship\\" of the \\"Jesus Seminar\\" and uses their remarkable voting-with-balls scheme as an illustration of _consensus_ among New Testament scholars. (It's not an illustration of consensus even within the \\"Jesus Seminar\\" itself.) And as though _that_ weren't enough, he even makes use of Jane Schaberg's _The Illegitimacy of Jesus_ (which argues, based on a couple of shreds of text, that Jesus must have been a mamzer).<br /><br />This is par for the course with Mitchell. His translation of _Genesis_ is chopped to bits because he relies on the JEDP \\"documentary hypothesis\\" and thinks he can tell (via Buddhist spiritual insight, one supposes) which portions of the text are spiritually worthwhile and which are not. Never mind that no two commentators have ever divided the texts in just the same way and that the hypothesis itself has been pretty well decimated by, e.g., Umberto Cassuto among others.<br /><br />Ditto his translations of Job (in which he omits the entire speech by Elihu) and the Psalms (in which he does a nice job with many of them but manages to turn all the \\"complaining\\" Psalms into expressions of spiritual acquiescence simply by omitting and rephrasing everything he finds insufficiently transparent). What he leaves _in_ is usually worth reading. But good heavens, how much he leaves out!<br /><br />In the present volume what is left out is why in the world anyone would ever have executed such a harmless Bu-Ju sage. Aside from a brief comment to the effect that it would have been dangerous to teach \\"the truth\\" in occupied Jerusalem, we are left altogether in the dark as to why this enlightened fellow could possibly have posed a threat to Roman rule.<br /><br />Also omitted is any consideration of even the possibility that Jesus's resurrection was a historical event. My word, Rabbi Pinchas Lapide devoted an entire book to elaborating the view that it probably _was_ historical even though he disagreed with Christianity about its precise significance. And even people who _don't_ think it was historical should be worried by Mitchell's repeated denigration of the \\"insight\\" of Peter, Paul, et alia, and his insistence that anybody who believes in a literal resurrection is the spiritual equivalent of a thumbsucker -- in contrast, say, to the more spiritually advanced Ralph Waldo Emerson and Friedrich Nietzsche, both of whom are quoted here at some length.<br /><br />On the other hand, he does do a decent job of placing some of Jesus's teachings in their historical Jewish context. And he remarks trenchantly that Jesus is \\"prototypically Jewish\\" in making \\"righteousness seem like the most beautiful thing in the world.\\" This, I think, is just right. (And I can't fault him for wanting everybody to read E.P. Sanders's _Jesus and Judaism_, which really is a great book.)<br /><br />Read carefully and critically, then. This _is_ a good bookon the whole; I've owned it since it was published and I still rather like a great deal of it. But watch out for Mitchell's tendency to substitute his own rather New-Agey \\"spiritual insight\\" for sound scholarship.ike a great deal of it.

So this looks like a good time to review this earlier book.<br /><br />As the title of Bennett's forthcoming book suggests, his primary interest in a philosopher is not whether he was right in every particular but whether he can be read profitably -- i.e., whether it is worthwhile to engage the philosopher's thought as a means to thinking things through oneself. And happily, Bennett's close and critical reading of Baruch Spinoza's _Ethics_ is carried out in this spirit.<br /><br />&quot;Happily&quot; because Bennett clearly has major disagreements with Spinoza, and disagreements do not always foster intellectual sympathy. But Bennett insinuates his way very carefully and deliberately into Spinoza's thought, with the skill of a sharp analytical thinker and the ease of one long familiar with his text. This is the sort of disagreement that makes for good philosophy; every philosopher should have a critic of Bennett's caliber.<br /><br />His exposition of the main lines of Spinoza's thought is clear and (in my opinion) correct. For example, in setting out the essentials of Spinoza's outlook, he makes a nice short argument that Spinoza was not (as is sometimes claimed) an atheist. (This is, by the way, in the context of a fine summary of Spinoza's &quot;rationalism.&quot;) I shall not multiply examples in a brief review; suffice it to say that Bennett takes great pains to let Spinoza speak for himself, and even to make arguments for Spinoza that Spinoza did not think to make on his own, before launching into searching criticism and disagreement. (He often begins his replies with remarks like, &quot;This is the very best I can do for Spinoza, but unfortunately it is not good enough.&quot;)<br /><br />And Bennett's disagreements are well-founded even where I disagree with them in turn. For example, he closes the volume with what is undoubtedly a controversial claim: that, based on his close reading, the second half of Chapter Five of the _Ethics_ really has nothing of value to offer the modern reader.<br /><br />Bennett does not especially like this conclusion and almost wishes that he could have omitted it from the book. Yet he finds himself driven to it by the difficulty -- which even Spinoza's defenders must surely acknowledge -- of finding anything in the passage that admits of any clear interpretation at all. Bennett concludes, with a great deal of justice, that if even Spinoza's keenest expositors descend into feckless handwaving and purple sermonizing when they come to this passage, the view that there is some crucially important meaning in it can hardly be maintained.<br /><br />Here again, this is just the sort of close, critical analysis to which anyone claiming the title of philosopher should expect to be subjected. (Time and again in reading this work, I am reminded of the tone and manner of C.D. Broad's _Examination of McTaggart's Philosophy_.)<br /><br />And again, it is clear that Bennett _does_ regard Spinoza's _Ethics_ as profitable reading. This is the sort of approach that helps to keep disparate philosophical &quot;camps&quot; talking to one another.<br /><br />(And it is a blessed relief from, say, Ayn Rand's nonsensical attacks on Immanuel Kant. Readers of Rand who want to see what genuine philosophical criticism looks like could do worse than to study Bennett. For that matter, some of Rand's shriller _critics_ might well emulate Bennett; though frankly I find Rand a good deal less profitable than Bennett finds Spinoza, it is still a pity that so few critical discussions of Rand's philosophy devote much effort to determining what she said and meant. Then, too, Rand's outlook shared some important features with Spinoza's, and some criticisms of the greater philosopher will therefore apply to the lesser one as well.)<br /><br />Bennett's work succeeds on several counts, then. Besides being a highly competent dissection of the best-known work of the &quot;saint of rationalism,&quot; together with some much-needed critical analysis, it is also a model of how to engage a thinker with whom one has important and perhaps irresoluble disagreements. The enterprise of philosophy can only be strengthened by this sort of thing.<br /><br />I shall therefore look forward to Bennett's discussions of Leibniz, Berkeley, et alia in his forthcoming book. If they are of this quality, they will be worth reading and rereading.ction of the best-known work of the &quot;saint of rationalism,&quot; together with some much-needed critical analysis, it is also a model of how to engage a thinker with whom one has important and perhaps irresoluble disagreements.

Rand, in contrast, means the faculty that sorts the material provided by the senses into mental file-folders. (And she doesn't distinguish clearly or consistently between &quot;the senses&quot; and &quot;sensory perception.&quot;)<br /><br />She claims both that the evidence of the senses is &quot;self-evident&quot; (the senses being &quot;axiomatically valid&quot;) and that the senses are our _only_ source of knowledge. Being a pretty sloppy philosopher, she doesn't bother to distinguish these two claims even though they are clearly different: even if the senses were 100% valid 100% of the time, they might still not be our sole source of knowledge. But it doesn't matter, since both claims are false anyway.<br /><br />The &quot;senses&quot; answer to the same standard as all of our other cognitive processes: reason. At a minimum, that means consistency. And yet Rand never quite gets around to telling us by which of our &quot;senses&quot; we recognize contradictions _as_ contradictions, or recognize that contradictions can't be true. Hmm; something seems to be missing from Objectivism here.<br /><br />But Rand covers her tracks by tagging rational insight as &quot;mysticism&quot; and collapsing necessity into identity. As a result, her epistemology (really her ontology; she only _thinks_ she's doing epistemology) leaves no room for explanation at all. In Randworld, once you know _that_ something is and _what_ it is, it's not even possible to ask _why_ it is; there is simply nothing else to know.<br /><br />I can back up this claim -- and elsewhere have backed it up; write me for details -- with a close reading of several of Rand's works together with Leonard Peikoff's _Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand_ (which, by the way, may be _the_ single most valuable resource for critics of Objectivism). The point here is that, in the final analysis, Rand &quot;defends&quot; reason by arguing that it doesn't exist. We just don't notice because she kept using the _word_ after she'd defined away the _reality_.<br /><br />That, by her own standards, is &quot;such a crime against humanity that no modern atrocities can equal it.&quot; But don't hold your breath waiting for her defenders to acknowledge it.<br /><br />Philosophy: who needs it?

She always maintained that anyone who rejected her epistemology had to reject the rest of her philosophy too. She was not, she said, _primarily_ an advocate of capitalism, but of egoism; and not _primarily_ an advocate of egoism, but of reason. And to this day, the boys at the Ayn Rand Institute insist that libertarians are whim-worshippers because they think they can keep &quot;her&quot; political ideas (they're not) without keeping her epistemological theories too.<br /><br />In _For The New Intellectual_ she castigated &quot;modern&quot; philosophers for having failed to solve the &quot;problem of universals&quot; and therefore having left the world helpless against the onslaught of the forces of unreason. Her _Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology_ was her attempt to solve that problem (and she failed; she didn't even state the problem correctly, let alone stick consistently to her own proposed &quot;solution&quot;).<br /><br />But it was from her epistemology, and in particular its famous trichotomy -- &quot;intrinsicism&quot; vs. &quot;subjectivism&quot; vs. &quot;objectivism&quot; -- that her philosophy took its name. That trichotomy is supposed to apply to values just as surely as to concepts, and it fails in ethical theory just as it fails in epistemology.<br /><br />One reason (not by any means the only one) is that Rand maintained roundly that _all_ one's moral &quot;obligations&quot; are hypothetical imperatives in the service of one's _own_ life, strictly dependent on one's own &quot;choice to live,&quot; a pre- and a-moral decision about which Objectivism can give no ethical guidance at all. In strict consistency, that means that if you are committing suicide by driving into a brick wall, you are under no moral obligation whatsoever to swerve in order to miss the little girl who wanders out in front of your car. That an ethical theory with this consequence has been able to pass itself off as &quot;objective&quot; is more than a little strange.<br /><br />Anyway, in some ways this is one of Rand's better books. As I mentioned in one of my earlier reviews, I've deducted some stars since I examined her arguments more closely; in particular, her odd attempt to define immoral people as literally _subhuman_ doesn't exactly strike me as a great advance. But on the whole this is probably her second-best book, _Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal_ being the best (and, thankfully, least original).ting suicide by driving into a brick wall, you are under no moral obligation whatsoever to swerve in order to miss the little girl who wanders out in front of your car.

But here's a short (and inadequate) statement of Weinrib's thesis: private law is an immanently rational process of implementing corrective justice according to internal standards that cannot be reduced to something outside of the law itself; its aim is to set right, insofar as possible, the relationship between the doer and the sufferer of a harm.<br /><br />The astute reader will already have noticed that Weinrib is at odds with &quot;law and economics&quot; -- and, sure enough, his short critiques of that field are devastatingly on target. The reviewer below who thinks Weinrib has ignored everything since Coase must not have been reading very carefully: in one sense, at least, Weinrib is concerned precisely to _rescue_ private law from the law-and-econ crowd, as well as from any other law-and-anything crowd who insists that law must be understood in terms of, and indeed reduced to, something else. His major claim is that it can't be.<br /><br />My own view, at least, is that Weinrib is entirely right on his main point: i.e., that private law has internal standards that can't be reduced to something external. In particular, private law seeks corrective justice and not &quot;economic efficiency,&quot; at least insofar as the latter is understood as the maximization of total &quot;wealth&quot; at the possible expense of what would ordinarily be called justice. (And it certainly has no truck with the sort of mathematically-ratified injustice known to the world as &quot;Kaldor-Hicks efficiency.&quot;)<br /><br />Weinrib's discussion of the famous Hand formula and his comparisons of U.S. with British common law on this topic are just wonderful. Between his theoretical work and Gary Schwartz's empirical analysis -- not to mention the criticisms of other writers like Richard Wright and Ronald Dworkin -- the Posner gang really should lie down and not get up again.<br /><br />However, as much as my philosophical sympathies are with Weinrib, I must disagree with a point or two. I'll take his treatment of negligence in tort law as my source of examples, since I just finished rereading that chapter last night.<br /><br />I am not, for example, overwhelmed by his discussion of the famous Palsgraf case. Weinrib takes J. Cardozo's side in this case and castigates J. Andrews's dissent for somehow missing the point of tort law. But even if this were true (and I don't think it is), what, exactly, would it show? That Andrews was just wrong? Or that tort law's immanent standards (on Weinrib's account thereof) are insufficient to deal with some cases with which tort law really ought to deal?<br /><br />If we can even sensibly ask this question -- and surely we can -- then it is not enough to insist on tort law's internal standards; those standards themselves may in turn require justification in terms of whatever it is that tort law _is_ founded on. (Not &quot;reduction to,&quot; but &quot;justification in terms of.&quot; I am not sure Weinrib always distinguishes these as carefully as he might.) True, Weinrib does maintain that private law is founded on the principles of corrective justice (and, by implication, that these principles are rationally apprehended). But he sometimes writes as though it just floats in a vacuum somewhere, blessedly free of commerce with any other human activities at which we might otherwise have to look in order to determine exactly what _is_ just under specific circumstances. (This is one of those Oakeshott-like undertones I mentioned. In my view Oakeshott, too, tended to overstate the degree to which any &quot;mode of experience&quot; can be isolated from the rest.)<br /><br />Moreover, some of Weinrib's arguments on specific points seem hard to tie in to his main thesis. For example, he opposesthe use of &quot;probabilistic causation&quot; in tort law on the grounds that tort law deals only with normative harms, not with the &quot;mere&quot; increased risk of normative harms. But the argument is not forthcoming that placing someone at significantly increased risk is not _also_ a normative harm in its own right.<br /><br />And some such argument is badly needed, since knowledge that e.g. one has been subjected to an increased risk of cancer does seem to involve positive harm already even if one hasn't developed cancer yet. It is at least arguable that one has been harmed by one's present worry and distress (not to mention the relevant medical expenses involved in checking to make sure one _doesn't_ have cancer).<br /><br />If so, then Weinrib's own regime can take account of &quot;probabilistic causation&quot; very easily, and indeed should do so rather than reject it outright. I agree with Weinrib (contra some other recent writers) that tort law ought not to throw out the concept of &quot;causation&quot; entirely; I'm just not persuaded that this point takes him as far as he seems to want to go. It appears to me that his theoretical foundations could be invoked as easily to justify as to eliminate some of the innovations he might prefer to dispose of.<br /><br />What is most helpful in this volume, then, is Weinrib's careful insistence that private law _is_ immanently rational and possesses coherent internal standards that are not reducible to something in some other field. But what seems to be missing is an account of why private law has just exactly those internal standards Weinrib says it has, and why it shouldn't recognize any others even if it can be shown that it can do so coherently.<br /><br />At any rate, Weinrib's work is brilliant from beginning to end. My comparatively minor disagreements with particular points and sub-points should not obscure my major agreements with much of his overall approach.the use of &quot;probabilistic causation&quot; in tort law on the grounds that tort law deals only with normative harms, not with the &quot;mere&quot; increased risk of normative harms.

Everybody in either camp is indebted, in one way or another, to the great Thomas Hill Green. And sooner or later, everybody in either camp will have to come to terms with him.<br /><br />Now, in my own not entirely humble opinion, Green's criticisms of other liberal theorists are well-founded and he himself has gotten the philosophical foundations just about exactly right. Basically, his claim is that (my paraphrase) the source of our rights against one another, as well as the source of the state itself, is our possession of an ideal common end in which the well-being of each of us is coherently included.<br /><br />He develops this account very painstakingly, and one of the joys of reading it is watching him make sense of Rousseau's tortured notion of the &quot;general will.&quot; By the time Green is through rescuing this doctrine from Rousseau, it becomes something altogether respectable: that (my paraphrase again) there is an overarching ideal end at which our actions aim, and it is that end which we _would_ have if all of our present aims were thoroughly modified and informed by reflective reason.<br /><br />I say &quot;_would_ have&quot; with some reservations, since for Green (as for Bosanquet and Blanshard, who followed him here) there is a clear sense in which we _really_ have this ideal end. But this point takes us afield into Green's metaphysics, which are better covered in his _Prolegomena to Ethics_.<br /><br />As I said, this volume marks the watershed between classical and modern liberalism. Green is often associated with the &quot;modern&quot; side of the divide, but today's reader will be surprised to see just how &quot;classical liberal&quot; Green was (in, e.g., his opposition to paternalistic government and in a good many other respects). Why, heck, there are passages that could have been lifted from David Conway's _Classical Liberalism: The Unvanquished Ideal_.<br /><br />It does seem, though, that in allowing a positive role for the governmental institutions of a geographically-demarcated State, he has started down the slippery slope to the modern welfare-warfare state. Like Hegel before him and like Bosanquet after him, Green usually means by &quot;state,&quot; not the bureaucratic machinery of a territorial government, but the whole of society including _all_ of its &quot;institutions of governance.&quot; But -- also like Hegel and Bosanquet -- he does not always keep these two things firmly distinguished, and at times he is clearly thinking specifically of the governmental institutions of a territorial nation-state rather than what some of us would call the &quot;market.&quot;<br /><br />He is also a bit unclear on the ground of &quot;rights.&quot; W.D. Ross rightly takes him to task for this in _The Right and the Good_: Green writes on one page that we have _no_ rights until these are recognized by society, and then turns around and writes as though &quot;society&quot; is recognizing rights we _already_ have. To my mind Ross clearly has the better of the argument here, though the problem is not, I think, terribly hard to fix.<br /><br />On the whole, then, it is probably no wonder that Green and his crowd set into motion -- whether inadvertently or otherwise -- a stream of &quot;liberalism&quot; that would eventually find a far, far larger role for the State than any that Green himself would have approved. But to my mind, these difficulties are removable excrescences, not the heart of his theory. (And it is also worth bearing in mind that Green provides moral grounds for _resisting_ the State: he acknowledges that no actual State is really ideal and, insofar as it falls short of the ideal, should be brought firmly into the service of our common end.)<br /><br />The theory itself seems to me to be sound. In fact, despite the aforementioned disagreements and several others, I would nominate this volume as perhaps _the_ single greatest work on liberal political theory.<br /><br />Again, at some point every &quot;liberal&quot; of any stripe will have to come to terms with Green's ideas (perhaps in highly mutated form). And if, with minor tweezing, Green's basic outlook is sound, it also -- suitably adjusted -- forms the proper basis for the classical-liberal commonwealth.<br /><br />It therefore behooves classical liberals and libertarians to get the word directly from Green himself.

(In some cases Conway makes better sense of these critics than they can make of themselves.)<br /><br />The entire enterprise is conducted with a winning combination of scholarly politeness and uncompromising, pull-no-punches intellectual rigor.

Aside from a couple of annoying verbal habits (e.g. always writing out Ayn Rand's full name every time he refers to her) and a couple of unpleasantnesses (e.g. some nasty remarks about the Brandens and the existing secondary literature on Objectivism), this is actually a pretty well-written and well-organized brief overview of Rand's thought. (Of course -- heh heh! -- you shouldn't expect to understand it all _right away_. It takes _many, many years of serious study_ to learn that Rand was absolutely correct in every single particular.)<br /><br />The presentation is orderly, if occasionally skimpy. Gotthelf devotes a couple of short, fawning chapters (well, all the chapters are short -- and fawning, too, come to think of it) to Rand's sinless life and then proceeds to take the reader on a guided tour through the main features of her thought in metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. Political theory gets short shrift, but that's okay; while it was undoubtedly the strongest (or at any rate the least vulnerable) portion of Rand's philosophy, it was also by far the least original (which, actually, is _why_ it was the least vulnerable). Aesthetics doesn't get much attention either, which is sort of too bad, but maybe Gotthelf doesn't want to give away too many of Rand's propaganda techniques.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the tour; it's always a pleasure to encounter a book that one has completely refuted before it was even published. The reviewer from Austin is right: Rand _wasn't_ really a very good philosopher. And Gotthelf's accurate-but-uncritical summary of Rand has been a tremendous help to me in rewriting, for publication, my critique of Rand's epistemology (still available in an earlier draft form on my website); he confirms and recommits every error I pick on her for, and may even introduce one or two new ones of his own. (For example, at one point he seems to imply that the &quot;primacy of existence&quot; premise commits him to materialism.)<br /><br />You may well imagine that critics of Objectivism (of whom I am obviously one) receive lots of silly e-mails telling them they've gotten this or that point entirely wrong (usually from people who don't seem to be able to read all that well themselves). So I'm happy to say that at numerous points I have been able to use Gotthelf's handy little text to confirm (yet again) that I was reading Rand correctly after all, and that she was just as wrong as I said she was. Now that I've taken account of his work in rewriting my own, the result is a much clearer critique. (Which just goes to show, I suppose, that Objectivists and libertarians _can_ cooperate in a good cause.)<br /><br />And I'm not kidding about the quality of Gotthelf's work; this _is_ a fairly well-executed introduction, although it will probably be a bit hard to read for anyone completely unfamiliar with Rand's work. For the most part (but not entirely!) this little book reads like a precis of Leonard Peikoff's _Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand_ (which is, by the way, one of the few items of &quot;secondary Objectivist literature&quot; about which Gotthelf has anything good to say). As such it will make a helpful companion to that volume, whether Peikoff likes it or not. (And as I hinted, if you read carefully you'll find a few points at which Gotthelf disagrees with Peikoff and the ARI mainstream. For example, did Rand think her ethic was founded on an &quot;axiom&quot;? Compare Gotthelf's remarks with David Harriman's in the _Journals of Ayn Rand_.)<br /><br />It will also be helpful to anyone -- Randie or otherwise -- who wants a quick and dirty summary of what Objectivism is all about.

The problem, ultimately, is not that Kelley is anything less than competent; it is that the task is impossible.<br /><br />And Kelley seems to know it. He does a very nice job of showing that the practice of benevolence is not, in fact, opposed to our real interests. But by his fifth chapter, he is reduced to telling us that &quot;[b]enevolence is obviously concerned with our relationships with other people.&quot;<br /><br />In fact benevolence is concerned with other people, period; benevolence, like justice, is an irreducibly other-regarding virtue. But Kelley's &quot;revisionist&quot; account of this virtue, in the end, merely reduces it to prudence. The possibility that the well-being of someone other than oneself may be _directly_ motivating to a rational agent is simply never raised.<br /><br />What seems to be going on here is what so often happens with readers of Rand: the thought of even her most critical followers is drawn out of its orbit by a misguided loyalty to her ideas, and even such clearly rational propositions as &quot;benevolence is good&quot; have to be, if not rejected entirely, at least warped altogether out of true in order to &quot;prove&quot; that they're really compatible with Objectivism after all. As a result even comparatively sensible Objectivists, like Kelley, wind up offering accounts of other-regard that reduce it without remainder to self-regard -- in effect taking themselves to have shown, not that benevolence is prudent (which it is), but that benevolence _is prudence_.<br /><br />The idea exercising the gravitational influence in this case is Rand's view that all moral standards are strictly &quot;hypothetical imperatives&quot; that follow from an a-moral and pre-moral &quot;choice to live&quot; -- and that therefore every moral principle proposed for any given agent must be justified _solely_ by its contributions to _that agent's own_ well-being. And Kelley et alia are at least right to recognize that something rides on this issue: give up this principle and you give up the &quot;Objectivist ethic.&quot;<br /><br />Of course, you also preserve the possibility of rights, justice, and benevolence, so the bargain isn't a bad one. But until leading Objectivist thinkers are willing to make that bargain, we shall continue to be treated to workmanlike attempts to prove that we can eat our cake and have it too, that &quot;benevolence&quot; isn't a &quot;stolen concept&quot; for egoists, that other-regard is not merely consistent with but actually _identical to_ enlightened self-regard -- that, in short, A is really non-A if only we believe sufficiently hard in fairies.are strictly &quot;hypothetical imperatives&quot; that follow from an a-moral and pre-moral &quot;choice to live&quot; -- and that therefore every moral principle proposed for any given agent must be justified _solely_ by its contributions to _that agent's own_ well-being.

Books	4	14	20	N	N	Includes a nice short critique of Rand's theory of knowledge	Over the past few years I've been working on a comprehensive critique of Ayn Rand's epistemology (currently being prepared for publication; an earlier draft version is available on my website). One of the conclusions to which I slowly but surely came is that her &quot;contextual theory of knowledge&quot; amounts to the following: what she has actually done is drop the requirement that knowledge be _true_ and define knowledge as &quot;contextually justified belief.&quot;<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when I cracked open this new book by George Smith and found that Chapter Four (&quot;Belief and Knowledge,&quot; pp. 61-78) develops that very same thesis by a slightly different route. Either great minds run in the same channels, or I've reinvented the wheel.<br /><br />The whole chapter is very well done. Smith also makes some pertinent comments on, e.g., the &quot;correspondence theory of truth,&quot; correctly noting (as I note in my own critique) that this theory ordinarily goes along with a &quot;representationalist&quot; or &quot;copy&quot; theory of knowledge. For my money, these eighteen pages alone are worth the price of the book.<br /><br />(An interesting sidenote: Allan Gotthelf remarks somewhere in his little book _On Ayn Rand_ that Objectivism is different from pragmatism in that Objectivism doesn't _define_ truth by its practical consequences. Maybe not -- but if Smith is right about Rand's theory of truth, as I obviously think he is, then the gap is considerably narrower than Gotthelf would have us believe.)<br /><br />The rest of the book looks pretty good so far too, although frankly I've only skimmed it looking for items of interest. It looks like a solid history of freethought and atheism, executed with Smith's usual clarity and flair. There is, for example, a nice short discussion of whether or not Spinoza was &quot;really&quot; an atheist; I personally think not, but Smith makes a good case that he couldn't have gotten much closer to atheism without falling in. (I disagree with Smith's own arguments for atheism, but they are at any rate well presented.)<br /><br />So it looks like a nice book overall. And that fourth chapter is a dilly; if you have any interest in Objectivist epistemology, grab this book ASAP.ut falling in.

In the admittedly &quot;extensive and well-researched commentary&quot;?<br /><br />Glancing over the commentary from last week's parsha (Vayigash) I find citations from the following sources among others: Ibn Ezra; Rambam; R. Avraham ben HaRambam; Ramban; R. Hirsch; R. Menachem Mendel of Kotzk; R. Bachya; R. Shlomo Ashtruc; Sforno; the Chafetz Chaim; R. Munk; R. Yosef Dov Solovetchik; R. Yaakov Kamenetzky; R. David Feinstein (not to mention the Zohar and other traditional texts cited by title rather than by author). Even this is not a complete list, and it is just silly to say that the commentary is &quot;not reflective of the variety that is present within the tradition of rabbinic Judaism.&quot;<br /><br />Nor would it even be correct to say that Rashi's interpretation is given precedence over others' (as would be expected if the translation were controlled by his commentaries). At 45:1, for example, the commentary cites three interpretations, one each from Rashi, Rashbam, and Ramban, without attempting to adjudicate between them. At 46:15 the commentary cites Rashi, then Ibn Ezra's contrary reading, then Ramban's disagreement with Ibn Ezra. And so forth.<br /><br />Of course Rashi is cited fairly often, as are other solidly tradition-based writers who have written extensive commentaries on the text (i.e., those who are said to be &quot;acceptable [from] a Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) point of view,&quot; to those whom our friend regards as &quot;religious extremists&quot;). Why this should be an occasion for surprise or alarm, let alone an indication that something is amiss with the _translation_ in this edition of the Chumash, is more than I can fathom.<br /><br />Nor is any other evidence offered that Rashi's interpretations have colored or biased the translation itself. And such evidence is very much needed, if only to establish the credibility of the one mounting the claim in question. To put it bluntly, anyone who levels such a charge had better be a highly competent reader of Hebrew himself.<br /><br />I must therefore suspect that the problem here is with traditional translation and commentary in general. It is exceedingly odd to describe straightforward Orthodox Judaism as &quot;fundamentalism&quot; -- a term much more descriptive of the various &quot;liberal&quot; movements which derisively tagged traditional Judaism as &quot;Orthodoxy&quot; in the first place.<br /><br />At any rate, such comments do tell the customer something important: this volume is faithful to Torah-based Jewish tradition in a way that even the most conservative &quot;liberal&quot; Jews will find uncomfortable. In other words, if you want to study Torah, this Chumash is just exactly the edition you need.><br />Nor is any other evidence offered that Rashi's interpretations have colored or biased the translation itself.

In this collection of scathing essays from _The Underground Grammarian_, Richard Mitchell took on the educational establishment and tore it to bits.<br /><br />Though his ostensible target was the slipshod use of language, he did not limit himself to the niceties of grammar; far from it. He shredded the popular theories of &quot;education&quot; that threatened (and still threaten) to turn children's minds to mush; he defended children's literature that didn't talk down to kids, didn't emasculate their stories into plotless little sessions of feelgood warmfuzziness, and didn't treat young readers as subjects for indoctrination into the latest forms of political mumbo-jumbo; and in e.g. his attacks on &quot;bilingual&quot; education, he decimated &quot;political correctness&quot; before it was called that.<br /><br />This collection includes what I think is the absolute cream of Mitchell's _UG_ essays, among them some that deserve to become classics. For example, his profound love of intellectual liberty, and his corresponding loathing for any obfuscation that threatened it, make his &quot;Politics and the Eglinsh [sic] Language&quot; a worthy successor to Orwell's famous essay.<br /><br />For my money, this is Mitchell's best book. I bought and read it when it was new -- and now that a reprint is available, I'm about to buy and read it again.	2001-01-03
2155442:US	52474360	R1TQM4URXU21T9	0947533974	25999627	The Elementary Cases of Sherlock Holmes (Adventures of Sherlock Holmes)	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Interesting and possibly authentic.	Ian Charnock has helpfully made available a series of Holmes tales from a surprising source: Stamford, the young fellow at Bart's who introduced Holmes to Watson. According to the volume's introduction (purportedly written in 1951, when Stamford was 91), the writer left strict instructions that the manuscript was not to be published until forty years after his death. We are probably expected to infer that this event came to pass in 1959.<br /><br />All but two of the cases recorded here are the ones to which Holmes referred in &quot;The Musgrave Ritual&quot;. Stamford narrates for us the cases of the Tarleton murders and of Vamberry the wine merchant, the matter of the old Russian woman, the singular affair of the aluminum crutch, and the full account of Ricoletti of the club foot (and his abominable wife). Two other cases appear here as well, one of which -- the case of the _Matilda Briggs_ and the giant rat of Sumatra (to which Holmes briefly alludes in &quot;The Sussex Vampire&quot;) -- stands, to my mind, a greater chance of being &quot;the real thing&quot; than the enjoyable but clearly inauthentic work by Richard Boyer published some twenty-five years ago. (Likewise, some of the other cases have been written up elsewhere in what are clearly pastiches rather than historical accounts.)<br /><br />These cases mostly take place, as Holmes mentions in &quot;Musgrave,&quot; before his biographer has come to glorify him. And the reader may well wish that Watson _had_ gotten round to writing these cases up; Stamford (if he is indeed the author) has not quite got the good doctor's touch with a tale, and for the most part the cases themselves are frankly not all that intrinsically interesting. (Moreover, the writing style limps a bit in places. The writer has the odd British habit of omitting punctuation altogether allowing sentences to run on and on like this and suddenly inserting a gratuitous comma somewhere near the end which makes for occasionally, confusing reading.)<br /><br />However, as Stamford notes in his introduction to the volume, he possesses valuable information about Holmes's early years that is not available elsewhere. In some cases the reader will have to watch carefully: Stamford is not above burying or encoding such information and leaving it to the reader to ferret it out. (For example, in a clear imitation of a famous &quot;contradiction&quot; in the canonical Holmes stories, Stamford refers to one character as &quot;John&quot; on one page and as &quot;James&quot; just a few pages later. In this case, however, the &quot;error&quot; is a clue to the real identity of the character.)<br /><br />But on the whole, the information has at least the ring of plausibility. And to my mind the somewhat artless style of the narrative tells in favor of its authenticity: it really does seem to be a reminiscence of an elderly Stamford rather than something cooked up by a professional writer. (I would have been suspicious if the style _had_ been too much like Watson's.)<br /><br />And perhaps most importantly, the character of Holmes rings true. In these tales we are encountering Xenophon's Socrates rather than Plato's, but it is clearly the same man -- or a very good imitation.<br /><br />Sherlockians/Holmesians will therefore probably enjoy this collection. As I suggested, the tales themselves are not all that gripping -- but that too is a point in favor of their authenticity, considering that they are alleged to date from so early in Holmes's career. And the (alleged) insights into the character and early history of Holmes himself will be of interest to all fans of the great detective.<br /><br />Naturally, of course, every reader will wish to judge their authenticity for himself or herself. But in my own view, these tales may well be genuine -- as opposed, for example, to the altogether enjoyable but clearly fictional &quot;reminiscences&quot; of Mary Russell in the Laurie King novels.<br /><br />Charnock is to be commended for making this collection available to the public. Readers seeking titillation or edge-of-one's-seat excitement will be mostly unimpressed. But those seeking information on the young Holmes himself will probably be pleasantly surprised at how well these tales satisfy their purely historical interest.ded for making this collection available to the public.

Most of them were just for &quot;personal use&quot;; as you can tell from my other reviews, I have a longstanding interest in philosophy anyway. But I waited until I completed a semester before reviewing them, so that I could plug the ones I found most useful.<br /><br />This is one of them. It's an expensive book, but it's worth it if you have any involvement (professional or student) in legal theory and philosophy of law. It consists mostly of papers presented at a conference held at Bowling Green State University a bit over a decade ago, and every item in it will be of tremendous interest to lawyers and law students investigating the philosophical foundations of their field.<br /><br />Two items are of particular interest, at least to me: Randy Barnett provides an update of his &quot;consent&quot; theory of contracts, and Ernest Weinrib offers a carefully reasoned piece that summarizes the outlook on which he would later expand in his brilliant 1995 work, _The Idea of Private Law_.<br /><br />The Barnett piece is, so far as I know, the only source for Barnett's theory of contracts apart from back issues of law journals and excerpts in law textbooks. Since some of Barnett's older pieces _are_ in fact excerpted in my own contracts text, I thought other law students might like to know about Barnett's essay in this book.<br /><br />The Weinrib piece is a terrific introduction to the man's thought in general. In fact I had read _The Idea of Private Law_ before I read this volume, but this essay nicely complements Weinrib's essay on &quot;legal formalism&quot; in Dennis Patterson's _Companion to Philosophy of Law and Legal Theory_ (also highly recommended, by the way).<br /><br />The collection overall covers contracts, torts, and punishment. In this last area, the volume includes a piece by the late Jean Hampton, and in general some of these essays link nicely to the collection _Incomparability, Incommensurability and Practical Reason_ (Ruth Chang, ed.).<br /><br />(In case you're curious: one _other_ really useful collection is _Philosophical Foundations of Tort Law_, edited by David Owen.

Most of them were just for &quot;personal use&quot;; as you can tell from my other reviews, I have a longstanding interest in philosophy anyway. But I waited until I completed a semester before reviewing them, so that I could plug the ones I found most useful.<br /><br />This is one of them. There are nineteen essays in this volume, all by heavy hitters among today's legal theorists. Almost every single essay is about the philosophical foundations -- or lack thereof -- of the concepts of tort law. And almost every one of them is extremely helpful in understanding the rationale(s), if any, behind these concepts. (Wanna know what a &quot;necessary element of a sufficient set&quot; is, and what it has to do with the legal concept of causation? See Tony Honore's essay. Wanna know what intent has to do with torts? Check out John Finnis's piece.)<br /><br />Now, I'm not saying you _need_ this book as a first-year law student. You don't. But if you have a background or an interest in philosophy, it will be of tremendous help to you -- both as a series of discourses that elaborate critically on the fundamentals you'll be studying in class, and as an introduction to the current crop of legal scholars. If you like this stuff, you'll want to go on to, e.g., John Finnis's _Natural Law and Natural Rights_, or Jules Coleman's _Markets, Morals and the Law_ and _Risks and Wrongs_, or . . .<br /><br />And quite apart from the intrinsic interest of the material itself, if your torts professor, like mine, is interested in public-policy issues, you'll find this collection extremely handy. It _may_ even help you eke out a few extra exam points (though I don't know yet whether it did so for me).<br /><br />(A valuable bonus for all you law-and-economics watchers: Richard Posner has an essay in here in which he admits the justice of most major criticisms of his outlook -- but says he doesn't care because he no longer has any confidence in systematic moral theories anyway. His retreat to pragmatism is unsurprising; Richard Wright has two brilliant pieces in here that, among other things, pretty much demolish the foundations of L&amp;E.

Many of my favorite books in philosophy follow a common pattern: the author will pose a problem or question, canvass its historically and/or presently available resolutions, say straightforwardly what he believes to be lacking in each, and offer a resolution of his own (or the beginning of one) that avoids the difficulties he has identified in the others.<br /> I will not say that _all_ philosophy books should be written to this plan. But the ones that are tend to fulfill a dual purpose: they provide a useful and nontrivial introduction/overview for a newcomer to the topic in question, and they genuinely advance the discussion among professionals who have long dealt with it. This isn't easy to pull off, and authors who manage to do it command my respect quite apart from whether I agree with their conclusions.<br /> Prof. Dennis Patterson of Rutgers University School of Law is such an author, and _Law and Truth_ is such a book. And the topic with which it deals is one that is, or should be, central to the philosophy of law: &quot;What does it mean,&quot; as Patterson himself puts it, &quot;to say that a proposition of law is _true_?&quot;<br /> Patterson sorts helpfully through the array of proposed answers to this question in contemporary juridprudence. In particular, he deals in turn with Ernest Weinrib's account of the immanent rationality of law; the moral realism of Michael Moore and David O. Brink; the legal positivism of H.L.A. Hart; the interpretation-based approaches of Ronald Dworkin and Stanley Fish; and the &quot;modal&quot; account of Philip Bobbitt. In each case he deftly, clearly, and fairly summarizes the account in question and proceeds to raise his own objections. (All his discussions are well executed, but I especially enjoyed his brilliant and occasionally wry reply to Fish.)<br /> He concludes with a chapter on &quot;Postmodern Jurisprudence,&quot; in which he sets out his own view. Having argued that the argument between legal &quot;realism&quot; and &quot;anti-realism&quot; is based on shared (false) premises, he maintains that the normativity of law is rooted firmly in communal _linguistic_ practices -- &quot;linguistic&quot; here being taken sufficiently broadly to include the forms of legal argumentation.<br /> I shall not try to comment in detail, as -- owing to other constraints on my time -- I have only just finished reading the book for the first time. But as a general matter, I can say that, while I do have disagreements with Patterson's thesis, I am surprised to have as _few_ disagreements as I do. In particular Patterson has an acute sense of one of the apparent paradoxes of legal truth -- that it is not simply a matter of accurate &quot;representation,&quot; but rather (this is not quite his own way of putting it) truth in law is in some way _constituted_ by our own activities, including speech and thought. (I would extend this insight to many other areas as well, by the way, and perhaps Patterson would too.)<br /> Now, the rejection of &quot;representationalism&quot; is not necessarily the acceptance of postmodernism; objective idealism would concur with that rejection but would likely balk at the apparent reduction of truth to a matter of strictly _linguistic_ practices a la the later Wittgenstein. And as I am in the objective-idealist camp myself, I would probably alter the way Patterson makes this or that point even when I agree with it in principle. (I also suspect that, although Patterson's critiques of Weinrib are trenchant and important, Weinrib's own account is probably able to deal with them.)<br /> Be that as it may, Patterson presents his case not only with a solid, accessible exposition of the philosophical issues at stake in the discussion but also with concrete and pertinent examples of actual legal reasoning and patterns of criticism. His well-chosen examples are remarkably successful both in highlighting flaws in existing accounts of legal truth and in supporting his own contrasting account. As for that account itself, where he sees a revolution, I tend to see a chance to revive some of the lost tenets of objective idealism; but even that would be a revolution in its way, and one not necessarily at odds with Patterson's own.<br /> Moreover, as I have noted already, his exposition will be an invaluable introduction to those who want to know why there is any fuss about the logical status of legal propositions in the first place. This volume will thus be of tremendous interest to a broad audience of scholars and students.sting account.

I can't say I have any great love for the school of thought expounded in  this volume. But if it's mathematical models you want, it's mathematical  models you'll get in this fine introduction. (Me, I disagree with the  mathematical-models approach pretty much _in toto_ and favor the Austrian  school of economics -- von Mises, Rothbard, et alia -- on a foundation of  rationalism. But my disagreement doesn't detract from the quality of  Miceli's presentation.)<br /><br />In each of the four areas mentioned in his  subtitle, Miceli presents a basic &quot;model&quot; in one chapter and then  rings the changes on it in the next. His presentation is clear and solid,  though it does require at least some background in undergraduate-level  mathematics. (And in general, it's a good idea to know at least enough  mathematics to overcome the tendency to be impressed by it!)<br /><br />Readers  interested in this field but without much background in math are advised to  read Mercuro/Medema's _Economics and the Law_ first, especially the chapter  on the Chicago School. I'd personally recommend reading Miceli's book  before moving on to Posner's _Economic Analysis of the Law_,  Landes/Posner's _Economic Structure of Tort Law_, and Shavell's _Economic  Analysis of Accident Law_.<br /><br />For another good introductory work in some  respects &quot;orthogonal&quot; to this one, see Polinsky's _An  Introduction to Law and Economics_. In addition to providing a fuller  discussion of the Coase Theorem, Polinsky also raises questions about  possible conflicts between efficiency and equity. Personally, I don't think  this entire school of thought deals adequately with those conflicts, but  Polinsky does make the attempt.<br /><br />Readers critical of &quot;law and  economics&quot; and seeking an opposing point of view -- indeed, an  opposing fundamental outlook -- might wish to read Ernest Weinrib's _The  Idea of Private Law_.

You'll be better equipped to read even, say, Mercuro/Medema's  excellent _Economics and the Law_ or Weinrib's also excellent _The Idea of  Private Law_ after reading the overviews presented here.	2000-09-18

Houman Shadab's review is right on the money -- including what's left  _out_ of this otherwise excellent introductory work. Since I like Hayek,  Barnett, and Rothbard, I find the omission disappointing -- but c'est la  vie.<br /><br />Anyway, if you're looking for a solid overview of the various  schools of thought involving the relations between law and economics, this  volume is a great place to start. (_Complete_ newcomers might also want to  pick up Dennis Patterson's _Companion to Philosophy of Law and Legal  Theory_, which includes a fine essay on &quot;Law and  Economics.&quot;)<br /><br />One tremendous merit of the present volume is that  it doesn't limit itself to the &quot;Chicago school.&quot; The U of Chi  crowd gets a single chapter, and the rest of the book is devoted to the  other schools of thought Mr. Shadab has helpfully listed below. The  resulting volume is therefore pretty comprehensive (with the exceptions  already noted).<br /><br />Readers interested in this topic may want to read  Thomas Miceli's _Economics of the Law_ next. I don't personally favor the  mathematical-models approach (for the usual Misesian/Rothbardian reasons)  -- but Miceli's volume is a fine introduction to that approach and will  afford the reader the opportunity to judge it on its merits.	2000-09-18

This massive collection of Holmes pastiches is a worthwhile addition to a Sherlockian collection although not all of its entries are of the same  quality. The tales themselves range from excellent through serviceable to  downright silly, with only a handful approximating the quality of Doyle's  original stories. Nevertheless the overall quality is very good, despite  some jarring notes here and there (more, of course, in some tales than in  others).<br /> Also helpful is the mass of information assembled at the rear  of the volume. Here we find a complete chronology of Holmes's cases -- not  only those recorded by Doyle, but also a fair number of those recorded by  others (including the contributors to this volume). Also most helpful is  the chronology's inclusion of Watson's unpublished cases, to which he often  alluded in passing. Some of these have since been published (in some cases  in several versions by several authors; such instances of redundancy  typically include pastiches by Adrian Conan Doyle and June Thomson).<br />  There is also a list -- not a complete list, which would have occupied a  full volume of its own -- of the Holmes tales extant as of 1997, together  with helpful information on their authors. (The list omits those tales in  which Holmes is not a central character -- e.g. Carole Nelson Douglas's  &quot;Irene Adler&quot; series -- and those which are of a clearly  fantastic nature, in which Holmes encounters e.g. Dracula or Edwin Drood.)  This valuable list will be helpful to readers who wish to track down works  by other pastiche artists of note -- say, Denis O. Smith (who is  represented in this volume) or June Thomson (who unfortunately is not). The  volume closes with capsules of information regarding each of the  contributors.<br /> The tales themselves are in most instances culled from  Watson's allusions to unpublished cases and are presented in what purports  to be chronological order. We find, for example, the business of the  Abernettys (drawn to Holmes's attention by a remark about the depth to  which the parsley had sunk into the butter on a hot day); the Darlington  substitution scandal; the &quot;very simple&quot; case Holmes had handled  for Mary Morstan's employer, Mrs. Cecil Forrester; the matter of the  Amateur Mendicant Society; the case of the Grice Petersons on the isle of  Uffa; the tragedy of the Atkinson brothers; the matter of the Addleton  curse; the death of Crosby the banker; the story of the red leech; the  Abergavenny murders; and a matter Holmes handled under a commission from  the Sultan of Turkey.<br /> Some of these cases have been written up before,  of course, in versions that are quite irreconcilable with those presented  here. Moreover, in a handful of cases there are at least superficial  conflicts internal to this volume itself: the &quot;red leech,&quot; for  example, is dealt with in passing in a second tale, and the business of the  Abernettys is mentioned in passing in terms that do not seem to suit the  version of the tale included here. Editor Mike Ashley tries valiantly to  deal with some of these conflicts. However, since few of these tales appear  to be authentic in the first place, these difficulties are merely  apparent.<br /> Not many of the pastiches contained herein reach the standards  set by the best of Doyle's tales. But the majority of them are better than  the worst of the originals. And in general, the pastiches in the  short-story genre are usually, to my mind, _much_ better than the  novel-length ones. In that field Nicholas Meyer has many competitors but  few rivals.ettys (drawn to Holmes's attention by a remark about the depth to  which the parsley had sunk into the butter on a hot day); the Darlington  substitution scandal; the &quot;very simple&quot; case Holmes had handled  for Mary Morstan's employer, Mrs. Cecil Forrester; the matter of the  Amateur Mendicant Society; the case of the Grice Petersons on the isle of  Uffa; the tragedy of the Atkinson brothers; the matter of the Addleton  curse; the death of Crosby the banker; the story of the red leech; the  Abergavenny murders; and a matter Holmes handled under a commission from  the Sultan of Turkey.<br /> Some of these cases have been written up before,  of course, in versions that are quite irreconcilable with those presented  here.

In this volume Richard Lancelyn Green has assembled some of the best of the noncanonical Holmes short stories as of 1986. I personally think _The  Exploits of Sherlock Holmes_ by Adrian Conan Doyle and John Dickson Carr is  a slightly better collection overall, but this one comes close.<br /><br />Adrian  Conan Doyle is represented here as well, the adventure of \\"Arnsworth  Castle\\" being simply a republication of \\"The Red Widow\\" from  _Exploits_. (I disagree with the reviewer who thought the story was a  \\"complete failure,\\" but I also disagree with anthologist Green  that it is the strongest of the younger Doyle's Holmes pastiches.)<br /><br />The  highlight of the collection is undoubtedly Denis O. Smith's \\"The  Purple Hand.\\" This is the first of Smith's Holmes tales (of which  another -- \\"The Silver Buckle\\" -- appears in _The Mammoth Book of  New Sherlock Holmes Adventures_); in general they are among the best  pastiches in the short-story genre. (Smith has published them in three  volumes under the title _The Chronicles of Sherlock Holmes_.)<br /><br />Other high  points include \\"The Tired Captain\\" and \\"The Green  Empress,\\" based on two unrecorded cases mentioned by Watson in the  first paragraph of \\"The Naval Treaty.\\" The latter of the two  cases requires a brief explanation.<br /><br />\\"The Green Empress\\" is the new title of the tale mentioned in a review below under the name \\"The  Second Stain.\\" Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, of course, wrote a story of that title as well, but the version he published does not seem to match the description in \\"The Naval Treaty.\\" There is also a reference to the \\"affair of the second stain\\" in the opening paragraph of \\"The Yellow Face\\" (which the Bantam/Doubleday version for some reason emends so that it refers instead to the \\"adventure of the Musgrave Ritual\\"). Some Sherlockians claim this remark refers to yet a third case, though I do not happen to know the foundation of this claim. At any rate there would thus appear to have been at least two and perhaps three Holmes cases catalogued by Watson under the same name.<br /><br />F.P. Cellie's tale fills in the details of the one mentioned  in \\"The Naval Treaty.\\" In 1967 it won a contest in South Africa  under its original title of \\"The Second Stain,\\" and its title has  been altered for publication in the present volume. End of explanation.<br /><br /> Another highlight: this volume is the only one currently in print -- so far  as I know -- in which Vincent Starrett's classic \\"The Unique  _Hamlet_\\" is collected. In my own view this pastiche is somewhat  overrated (being among other things ludicrously easy to solve), but at any  rate it's a good one to have; at least it was one of the first, having been  privately published in 1920.<br /><br />And another point which may be of interest  to Amazon shoppers: the larger and more recent collection _The Mammoth Book  of New Sherlock Holmes Adventures_, edited by Michael Ashley (and with a  foreword by Green), does not include _any_ overlap with the present volume.

Since Doyle's  death, there have been plenty of people writing knockoffs of his stories.  But with rare exceptions (Nicholas Meyer comes to mind), most have not  lived up to the high standards Doyle set in at least the best of his Holmes  tales.<br /><br />This volume includes the complete canon of Doyle's original  stories -- four novels and fifty-six short stories, from &quot;A Study in  Scarlet&quot; to &quot;His Last Bow.&quot; While there are a handful of  cases that bore significantly on international affairs (e.g. &quot;The  Bruce-Partington Plans&quot;), most of them are of interest simply because  of that touch of the _outre_ that Holmes loved so much and that provided  such stimulating material to the ideal reasoner.<br /><br />There are some  clunkers in the canon, of course, but the vast majority of these stories --  especially the earliest ones -- are just brilliant. If you are reading them  for the first time, I envy you; the sturdy Dr. John Watson is about to  introduce you to a new world, a world of Victorian gaslight and  Stradivarius violins, of hansom cabs and cries of &quot;The game's  afoot!&quot;<br /><br />For in reading this volume you will find such classic  tales as &quot;The Red-Headed League&quot; and &quot;The Man With The  Twisted Lip&quot;; you will encounter the famous dog that did nothing in  the night-time (&quot;Silver Blaze&quot;) and several versions of Holmes's  favorite maxim (&quot;When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever  remains, however improbable, must be the truth&quot;); and you will meet  one of the most fascinating and memorable characters ever to spring from  the printed page: Holmes himself.<br /><br />Perhaps most importantly, you will  catch a glimpse of the world as an ideal reasoner might see it -- not as a  grab-bag of random atomic facts in which our own role is negligible, but as  a vast interconnected whole in which each part bears some necessary  relation to the rest, and in which the reasoned pursuit of justice in all  matters great and small is the business of each and every one of  us.<br /><br />Incidentally, the twentieth-century philosopher who presented that  vision most consistently and cogently is, to my own mind, Brand Blanshard,  and any Holmes readers who are interested in philosophy may enjoy  investigating Blanshard's works as well.igible, but as  a vast interconnected whole in which each part bears some necessary  relation to the rest, and in which the reasoned pursuit of justice in all  matters great and small is the business of each and every one of  us.<br /><br />Incidentally, the twentieth-century philosopher who presented that  vision most consistently and cogently is, to my own mind, Brand Blanshard,  and any Holmes readers who are interested in philosophy may enjoy  investigating Blanshard's works as well.	2000-08-09

In this volume, Eugene Freeman has helpfully collected and edited  twenty-three talks by rationalist philosopher Brand Blanshard, twentieth  century philosophy's finest exemplar of what he himself called the  &quot;rational temper.&quot;<br /><br />The talks are grouped loosely around the  theme, &quot;What is the purpose of education?&quot; They are divided into  three sections: &quot;Ends,&quot; a series of eight talks in which the  question is pretty directly addressed; &quot;Corollaries,&quot; eight talks  in which several related issues are canvassed; and &quot;Homilies,&quot; a  group of seven &quot;humanistic sermons&quot; in which Blanshard offers  reflective advice on matters from &quot;books&quot; to &quot;courage&quot;  to &quot;admiration.&quot;<br /><br />I won't try to summarize the specific  content of this broad collection, but the overall thrust is the same as  that of Blanshard's philosophy in general. Basically, Blanshard identifies  education with philosophy, not as a narrow technical specialty but as the  broad attempt to &quot;see things steadily and whole.&quot; He develops  this theme with his usual style, grace, vigor, and urbanity, and very  effectively excoriates the antirationalism of most of the twentieth  century.<br /><br />Readers new to Blanshard and without much background in  philosophy might want to start with this volume, which is uniformly  accessible and non-technical and deals with themes that will be of general  interest. Many passages present nontechnical discussions of themes  Blanshard treats at greater length in his longer works (particularly  _Reason and Goodness_). Most of these discussions cover territory that will  be familiar to Blanshard's longtime readers, but even they (well,  &quot;we&quot;) will find some new delights here. (I am thinking  particularly of &quot;Sanity in Thought and Art,&quot; which is cited  several times in _The Philosophy of Brand Blanshard_ but is not in print  anywhere else.)<br /><br />As Blanshard notes in this volume, our admirations  tell us something about ourselves and prompt us to become more fully what  we are and should be. One object of my own admirations is Blanshard  himself, and I recommend his works highly for the inspiration I have drawn  therefrom.Blanshard notes in this volume, our admirations  tell us something about ourselves and prompt us to become more fully what  we are and should be.

I've read a few of Rucker's other nonfiction books (his fiction is another  topic entirely), and I think this one is still his best. I bought and read  it when it was new and I'm about to buy a replacement copy.<br /><br />The  &quot;book description&quot; on this page touches briefly on one of  Rucker's key points: &quot;the transcendent implications of Platonic  realism.&quot; This is well put, and the remarks above correctly relate  this point to Rucker's &quot;conversations with Godel.&quot; Godel was a  mathematical Platonist -- that is, he believed that mathematical objects  are real in their own right and that the mind has the power to grasp them  directly in some way.<br /><br />Rucker gets this right, unlike some other  better-known interpreters of Godel who have co-opted his famous Theorems in  the service of strong AI. Rucker, too, thinks artificial intelligence is  possible, but for a different reason which he also here explores: he takes  the idealistic/mystic view that _everything_ is conscious in at least a  rudimentary [no pun intended] way, and so there's no reason to deny  consciousness to computers and robots. Heck, even rocks are conscious --  just not very :-). (I don't know whether Rucker would still defend this  idea today or not. At any rate, for interested readers, a more elaborate  version of panpsychism is developed and defended in Timothy Sprigge's _The  Vindication of Absolute Idealism_.)<br /><br />These and other speculations are  the jewels in a setting of solid exposition. Rucker is powerful in general  on the topic of set theory, which he takes to be the mathematician's  version of theology. And his discussions are a fine introductory overview  of the various sorts of infinity, including but not limited to mathematical  infinities. He is remarkably familiar with the literature of the infinite  both inside and outside of mathematics, e.g. calling attention to certain  neglected works by Josiah Royce (who discusses infinities in an appendix to  _The World and the Individual_). He also discusses, quite accessibly, some  of the paradoxes that arise from treating the set-theoretic  &quot;universe&quot; as a completed, all-there-at-once set in its own  right.<br /><br />Rucker, a descendant of G.W.F. Hegel in both body and spirit,  could be read profitably on this topic by a pretty wide audience. In  particular he is a good cure, or at least the beginning of a cure, for  certain philosophers who (more or less following Aristotle) would deny the  real existence of actual infinities in particular and mathematical objects  in general. (Also for interested readers: another, more technical defense  of realism with regard to mathematical objects can be found in Jerrold  Katz's _Realistic Rationalism_.)<br /><br />My original copy of this book was  published, with some justification, in Bantam's &quot;New Age&quot; series.

2332208:US	52474360	R3OCDZ19CWOHYD	1573928097	317628734	An Enemy of the State: The Life of Murray N. Rothbard	Books	5	65	74	N	Y	Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.	It can't possibly be an easy job to condense the life of one of the  twentieth century's greatest thinkers into less than four hundred pages.  Indeed, author Justin Raimondo notes in his introduction that he hopes only  to offer &quot;what is little more than an extended biographical sketch, to  capture the essential Rothbard, not only his ideas but also his personality  and some sense of his historical significance.&quot;<br /> Raimondo is too  modest.<br /> I'll keep this brief since other reviews of this book are  available online (and if you write to me I'll tell you where to find them).  What Raimondo actually provides in this volume is a cradle-to-grave  overview of Rothbard's entire life and career, together with insightful  summaries of carefully selected portions of Rothbard's thought. No doubt  there is a great deal that Raimondo must omit or curtail. Nevertheless he  provides considerably more than a &quot;sketch.&quot;<br /> Not that  Raimondo's skills as a sketch artist are negligible. But the word  &quot;sketch&quot; is better applied to his accounts of the various _other_  persons who populate his account -- from Rothbard's father David to Mises  Institute founder Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr. His accounts of these others  are masterful sketches. But he brings Rothbard himself to life in a  well-realized portrait of this giant of libertarianism.<br /> Raimondo  provides more: a defense and a vindication. Rothbard was the subject of  scurrilous charges from several quarters throughout much of his career and  even after his death, including (at the time of this writing) some  misrepresentations from the &quot;Objectivist&quot; camp regarding the  period of Rothbard's involvement with the Randian inner circle. Raimondo's  handling of this topic is typical of his overall approach: he delves into  Rothbard's personal correspondence and reveals, deftly and vigorously, what  was actually going on -- not at all flatteringly to Rand and the founders  of her cult.<br /> In fact Raimondo really ought to be better known than he is  as a critic of the &quot;Objectivist&quot; movement in general and of Rand  in particular. Not surprisingly, Rothbard's encounter with Rand occupies  some twenty-five pages of the present work, and Raimondo's incisive  discussion is as penetrating and devastating as his earlier destructive  criticism of Rand in _Reclaiming the American Right_. I shall with  difficulty resist the temptation to spoil some of Raimondo's surprises; but  for these twenty-five pages alone this book should be of interest to anyone  even remotely interested in the &quot;Objectivist&quot; movement.<br />  William F. Buckley does not come off well either; nor do the numerous  lesser critics who buzzed about Rothbard like gnats. And of course there  are fine positive accounts of Rothbard's wife JoAnn (&quot;Joey, the  indispensible framework&quot;), his various longtime friends and  associates, the great Ludwig von Mises, and the numerous other persons  whose paths intersected Rothbard's for good or ill.<br /> Amazingly, Raimondo  manages to integrate all of this with an exposition of Rothbard's key  economic and political insights. Obviously a good deal has had to be left  out, or the book would have become unmanageably long. Nevertheless all of  Rothbard's central themes are here, and all of his major works are given at  least capsule summaries in their proper biographical context. This is no  small feat -- especially since standard economic textbooks have trouble  getting straight the Rothbardian views that Raimondo summarizes with  apparent ease.<br /> All in all, then, an astonishingly fine book that will be  of interest both to those who already know who Rothbard was, and to those  who have never heard of him before. &quot;If this modest volume does its  part,&quot; Raimondo writes in his introduction, &quot;to make [Rothbard's]  thought more accessible and readily available to a wider audience, it will  have accomplished its purpose.&quot;<br /> To that purpose it is admirably  suited. Read it at once, and share it with everyone you know. And  congratulations to Raimondo for a daunting task surpassingly well done.d its purpose.&quot;<br /> To that purpose it is admirably  suited.

As Huston Smith writes in his introduction to this valuable work, it was  some twenty years after he wrote _The World's Religions_ (originally  entitled _The Religions of Man_) that he came to understand the  &quot;core&quot; worldview common to all religions. That was in 1972, when  this book was first published.<br /><br />It is that &quot;core&quot; view which  he presents here. Essentially it is this: there are &quot;levels of  being&quot; such that the more real is also the more valuable; these levels  appear in both the &quot;external&quot; and the &quot;internal&quot;  worlds, &quot;higher&quot; levels of reality without corresponding to  &quot;deeper&quot; levels of reality within. On the very lowest level is  the material/physical world, which depends for its existence on the higher  levels. On the very highest/deepest level is the Infinite or Absolute --  that is, God.<br /><br />Basically this volume is an attempt to recover this view  of reality from materialism, scientism, and &quot;postmodernism.&quot; It  does not attempt to adjudicate among religions (or philosophies), it does  not spell out any of the important _differences_ between world faiths, and  it is not intended to substitute a &quot;new&quot; religion for the  specific faiths which already exist.<br /><br />Nor should any such project be  expected from a work that expressly focuses on what religions have in  common. Far from showing that all religions are somehow &quot;the  same,&quot; Smith in fact shows that religions have a &quot;common&quot;  core only at a sufficiently general level. What he shows, therefore, is not  that there is really just one religion, but that the various religions of  the world are actually agreeing _and_ disagreeing about something real,  something about which there is an objective matter of fact, on the  fundamentals of which most religions tend to concur while differing in  numerous points of detail (including practice).<br /><br />Of course any two  religions therefore have much more in common than any single religion has  with &quot;materialism&quot;. In fact one way to state the &quot;common  core&quot; of the world's religions is simply to say that they agree about  the falsehood of &quot;materialism.&quot;<br /><br />The volume stands well  enough in its own right, of course, but it also makes an excellent  companion to _The World's Religions_. (And if you are looking for an  introductory overview of what the great world religions believe and teach,  that other work is highly recommended.)<br /><br />It also contains a critique of  Darwinism which, as Smith notes in his introduction, has since found some  gratifying confirmation in the writings of others. Smith, writing in 1991,  mentions Phillip Johnson's _Darwin On Trial_; since that time a number of  other critiques have been published, including a few more by  Johnson.<br /><br />The reader of this book might therefore also wish to look  into Johnson's books as well as some or all of the following: Lee Spetner's  _Not By Chance!_, Michael Denton's _Evolution: A Theory in Crisis_ and  _Nature's Destiny_, William Dembski's _Intelligent Design_ and _The Design  Inference_, and Michael Behe's _Darwin's Black Box_.

Into the  bargain we get helpful essays and marginal notes, along with some of the  illustrations from the stories' original publication. Not just a collection  of the complete canon, then, this set is also an important work of  Sherlockian scholarship.<br /><br />Baring-Gould was also the author of the  standard Holmes biography, _Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street_. Grab that one  too, if you can find it. Baring-Gould's detective work must have been  pretty darned good, because some of his speculations were confirmed in the  mid-1970s with the discovery of a lost manuscript from the hand of Watson  himself (edited by Nicholas Meyer and published under the title _The Seven  Per Cent Solution_).<br /><br />I wish some of these kids today who write Holmes  &quot;pastiches&quot; would consult both Baring-Gould _and_ Meyer before  popping off into their unfounded speculations :-).	2000-08-03

In this volume Sir W. David Ross expands on his earlier (and much shorter)  work _The Right and the Good_, developing his views and replying to  criticisms from e.g. Charlie Dunbar Broad and other contemporary  philosophers. Over the course of some three hundred pages, Ross provides  penetrating analyses of the concepts of right, obligation, and good,  arguing among other things that the meaning of &quot;right&quot; is not  simply reducible to &quot;whatever maximizes the good.&quot; Probably his  best-known contribution to ethical theory is his notion of a _prima facie_  duty, introduced in his earlier work and explicated here with Ross's usual  workmanlike thoroughness.<br /><br />Ross was a solid representative of the  rationalist-intuitionist-deontologist axis in twentieth-century ethics;  influenced by Prichard and Moore and a first-class Aristotelian scholar to  boot, he was a profound and thorough thinker who deserves to be more widely  read. For example, his discussion of determinism (and why determinism  doesn't undermine ethics) in chapter ten is, to my mind, one of the finest  of its kind.<br /><br />I have occasionally seen Ross's prose style criticized as  somewhat plodding and tortuous. I see no foundation for this criticism.  Ethical philosophy, at least as Ross himself treated it, is not a flashy  affair; like all philosophy, it is a matter of trying to think clearly and  well. This Ross does like a master, and readers who prefer clarity and  substance in their philosophy will find Ross's style eminently suited to  his material. Readers who would rather subject themselves to declamations,  rhetoric, and dogmatic asseveration in the service of nothing much are  advised to look elsewhere -- to Nietszche, Kierkegaard, Wittgenstein,  Sartre, and Ayn Rand, for example.	2000-08-03

Patrick Callahan's excellent review is right on the money, but I'm giving  this little book four stars anyway just because, when it's good, it's  _very_ good. Some of the stories contained herein -- based on Watson's  occasional references to unrecorded (not \\"unsolved\\", as the current edition's subtitle incorrectly has it) cases -- surpass some of the elder Doyle's later works. Highly recommended, especially as an antidote to the surfeit of \\"pastiches\\" that can't seem to get any of the details  right.<br /><br />Adrian Conan Doyle (with or without John Dickson Carr) tells a  straight no-frills tale very much in the spirit of the Sherlockian canon;  Holmes doesn't wind up getting married, Watson doesn't turn out to be the  real Holmes, et cetera, et cetera. And there are no attempts to link Holmes  to fabulous ripped-from-the-headlines figures like Dracula or Jack the  Ripper -- these are perfectly ordinary cases of the kind in which Holmes  himself was known to delight for their own sake owing to their touch of the  _outre_ and the singular features they presented to the reasoner. Solid  stuff despite the weaknesses of a few of the tales.<br /><br />If you want a  couple of novel-length pastiches to go with it, I recommend Nicholas  Meyer's first two: _The Seven Per Cent Solution_ and _The West End Horror_.	2000-08-03

Baring-Gould's classic biography of Holmes is brilliant from start to  finish. Arguably the greatest Sherlockian scholar ever, Baring-Gould  assembles the details of Holmes's life from isolated references in the  canonical stories and indulges himself in some inferential reasoning as to  some of the missing information: he contends, for example, that a certain  well-known U.S. consulting detective is actually the child of Holmes and  Irene Adler. (Some of his speculations on other matters have been borne out  by the discovery of a lost manuscript published by Nicholas Meyer under the  title _The Seven Per Cent Solution_.)<br /><br />Readers of this work will also  want to find a copy of Baring-Gould's masterly _The Annotated Sherlock  Holmes_ if possible. These kids writing Holmes pastiches today just don't  know what the hell they're doing :-).	2000-08-03

Watson, M.D. (Norton Paperback)	Books	5	25	29	N	N	Meyer's Holmes: the best of the best.	Brilliantly done. I've been reading Doyle's Holmes stories for nearly thirty years; I read Meyer's _Seven Per Cent Solution_ when it was new and I still have my original copy. I've also read some of the other attempts to  bring Holmes to life again in full-length novels, and in my own view Meyer  is the only one who nails it.<br /><br />Indeed he even improves on the original  tales in some respects. His account of what _really_ happened between  &quot;The Final Problem&quot; and &quot;The Empty House&quot; has the ring  of plausibility, and it does far greater credit to Watson than many of  Doyle's stories do.<br /><br />Especially in the later stories, Doyle tended to  treat Watson as an inept dunderhead, a practice unfortunately followed by  some of his blinder imitators. Meyer's take is that Watson employed  artistic license in order to bring out the brilliance of his companion, but  that the real Watson couldn't have been such an incompetent idiot if he was  both a trained medical man and the valued companion of the world's first  consulting detective.<br /><br />So in this &quot;rediscovered&quot; manuscript,  Meyer does both of these Victorian gentlemen proud. The novel -- which is  both an adventure and a warmly humane tale of Holmes's and Watson's  friendship -- is sprinkled with touching scenes of genuine affection  between the two lifelong friends; the good Watson finally gets his due as a  companion and as a human being, and the not-so-bloodless-after-all Holmes  comes vividly to life as well. One of the most moving moments (there are  many) comes in Holmes's remark to Watson: &quot;Never let them say you were  merely my Boswell, Watson. Never let them say that.&quot;<br /><br />I won't tell  you where and when that remark occurs, and in general I won't spoil the  novel for anyone who hasn't read it yet. But it's the sort of Holmes  pastiche that reviewers like to describe as a &quot;corking good  read,&quot; and in this case they're right. Moreover, Meyer relies on the  very best Holmesian scholarship (notably William S. Baring-Gould) on  matters of chronology and other detail, though I'm sure some of the Baker  Street Irregulars will be able to pick nits. If you enjoyed Doyle's  stories, you'll love this one -- and _The West End Horror_, too. (I was  less impressed by _The Canary Trainer_.)<br /><br />[P.S. Most of you probably  already know this, but just in case somebody doesn't: Yes, this is the very  same Nicholas Meyer who directed the best of the _Star Trek_ movies. You'll  find a bit of Holmes homage in _Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country_,  which Meyer helped to script.

With a tough act to follow, he meets the same standards in the  present volume.<br /><br />Without giving away details, I can tell you only that  the case involves a pair of grisly murders on London's West End. Holmes is  brought into the matter by a friend whose name I will not divulge -- a  certain then-unknown Irish playwright who resembles a giant leprechaun,  detests Shakespeare, and far from recompensing Holmes for his services, has  an annoying habit of allowing the detective to buy him dinner.<br /><br />The  resulting adventure takes Holmes and Watson all over the theater district,  where they meet with a number of well-known personages whose presence  explains why this case has never seen the light of day before: it would  simply have been impossible for Watson to follow his usual practice of  disguising this cast of characters for publication. (&quot;I shall change  the names,&quot; Watson tentatively suggests in seeking Holmes's permission  to commit the tale to print. &quot;That is precisely what you cannot  do,&quot; Holmes rejoins. The details of this exchange may be found in the  volume's introduction.)<br /><br />Meyer handles the entire project with wit and  panache, remaining loyal to the Holmesian oeuvre and even improving on  Doyle's own treatment of his memorable characters. All in all, a very  impressive work that will delight fans of the original Holmes stories. It  can be read quite independently of _The Seven Per Cent Solution_, by the  way, though that one is highly recommended too. (I was less impressed with  _The Canary Trainer_.)<br /><br />[P.S.

In this tightly reasoned volume, Noah Lemos explores what is meant by  &quot;intrinsic value&quot; and on what basis we may legitimately believe  in such values.<br /> Any book on such a topic is bound to be indebted to  Brentano, Moore, Ross, and Ewing; Lemos pays the debt, aligning himself  carefully with their tradition and deftly explicating his own agreements  and disagreements with each of his forebears. (He also touches briefly on  Prichard and Broad.)<br /> He also deals closely with two significant recent  works: Roderick Chisholm's _Brentano and Intrinsic Value_, and Panayot  Butchvarov's _Skepticism in Ethics_. (I am happy to add that he fields  several objections raised by Brand Blanshard in his forgotten opus, _Reason  and Goodness_, and not only because I wish that book were more often read.  Despite my tremendous admiration for Blanshard -- who was a friend of  Ewing's, by the way -- I happen to think Ewing had the better of the  argument on several points of ethical theory. Lemos's replies to Blanshard  are trenchant and, in my own view, usually correct.)<br /> Lemos defends  several important theses in the first part of the book (chapters 1-6).  First he argues that intrinsic value may be explicated in terms of (though  not necessarily reduced to) the appropriateness or otherwise of emotional  attitudes toward the proposed value-bearer. (His analysis of the various  sorts of neutrality is especially clear and incisive.) As to what sorts of  thing can be bearers of intrinsic value, he holds that among abstract  objects, the only plausible candidates are facts -- that is, states of  affairs which actually obtain; states of affairs which do not obtain, he  argues, are not intrinsically good except in a hypothetical sense that  presumes their hypothetical existence. Significantly, he denies that  _properties_ can be intrinsically good. He also tentatively denies the  possession of such value by &quot;concrete particulars&quot; (individual  people and things).<br /> He then sets out a defense of the theory of organic  unities (the view, that is, that certain states of affairs may have  intrinsic values that are not simple sums of the values of their parts) and  the principle of universality (that parts do not change their strictly  intrinsic values according to the wholes they are in). His defense of the  latter principle places him at odds with Ross, but I think Lemos has much  the better of the argument here. Invoking these principles, he finds reason  to believe that some sorts of intrinsic value are higher than others and  that the &quot;principle of summation&quot; should be rejected.<br /> As to  the sorts of state of affairs that have intrinsic value, Lemos devotes one  chapter to pleasure and one to such further candidates as morally good  emotions, the satisfaction of desire, correct judgment, knowledge,  understanding, consciousness, beauty, and -- interestingly -- the  flourishing of certain examples of nonsentient life. He concludes that  there are various intrinsic goods and that most of his proposed candidates  do indeed qualify.<br /> For believers in intrinsic value, most of the  controversy here will surround the final item on the list. Ross held that  the only states of affairs that have intrinsic value are states of mind and  the relations between them; Moore held a different view in _Principia  Ethica_ but changed his mind in _Ethics_; Blanshard agreed with Ross and  applauded Moore's return to good sense. Lemos departs from the traditional  mainstream here and mounts a plausible case that the &quot;consciousness  thesis&quot; is false: there are some intrinsic goods which do not depend  on the existence of consciousness for their value. (I say his case is  plausible, and so it is. But in the end I do not myself find it altogether  convincing; I remain unrepentantly of the opinion that Ross was right.)<br />  In the second part of the volume (chapters 7-9), Lemos turns to another  crucial topic:our _warrant_ for believing in this or that intrinsic value.  Here he offers by turns a defense of nonnaturalism (devoting, for example,  several pages to a well-considered reply to David O. Brink's _Moral  Realism_); a defense of modest a priori justification for judgments of  intrinsic value (including the construction of a moderate alternative to  Chisholm's strong conception of a priori knowledge as well as a fascinating  development of Lemos's own concept of an &quot;intrinsically acceptable  proposition&quot;); and a demonstration of the inadequacy of two major  alternatives to his theory of a priori justification (coherence theories,  and &quot;empirical&quot; theories that take emotion as their warrant for  value-judgments). He concludes, I think rightly, that judgments of  intrinsic value do enjoy a modest a priori justification and that this  status is at least no more problematic for value-judgments than for other  sorts of judgment.<br /> I have said that the volume is tightly reasoned, but  it is not for that reason difficult to read. Lemos is a very clear  expositor; his book, though aimed mainly at professional philosophers and  advanced students, can be in fact read by anyone with a basic familiarity  with philosophical ethics. (It is too bad Blanshard's _Reason and Goodness_  is no longer in print, for it makes an excellent introduction to ethics  generally.) At any rate, Lemos's volume is an excellent work and one that  is bound to be a standard in its field.our _warrant_ for believing in this or that intrinsic value.

I am a tremendous admirer of Jonathan Lowe's books, both for his even-handed, thorough, and nuanced treatment of his topics and for the extraordinary lucidity of his expository prose style. So, naturally, I  ordered this volume as soon as it became available, with high  expectations.<br /> I was not disappointed. This fine volume is a complete,  systematic introduction to the philosophy of mind. And Lowe's remarkable  exposition will be accessible to the beginner but sacrifices nothing in  precision or completeness in order to achieve that accessibility.<br /> The  main feature that sets this volume apart from other apparently similar  introductions is the balance Lowe strikes between philosophy proper and  cognitive science. Lowe spares no effort to incorporate relevant results  from empirical research, but he is quite unwilling to concede that  philosophy has simply become the handmaid of empirical psychology or  neuroscience. In spirit though not in detail, his approach reminds me of  Brand Blanshard's in _The Nature of Thought_.<br /> Moreover, Lowe's  presentation is more concerned with raising important questions than with  determining their answers. Some of the most valuable passages in his book  simply point out the existence of significant _problems_ and canvass the  possible solutions. In some cases he prefers one solution to another and  says so, giving his reasons. But in every case the entire array of  proposals receives a fair hearing, with references.<br /> The text consists of  an introduction and nine topical chapters, devoted in turn to these title  topics: minds, bodies, and people; mental states; mental content; sensation  and appearance; perception; thought and language; human rationality and  artifical intelligence; action, intention, and will; and personal identity  and self-knowledge. The order of the chapters is of course important, but I  find that each can be read as a mostly self-contained introduction to its  topic.<br /> The coverage is extremely thorough. Lowe's discussion introduces  a wide range of subissues, including e.g. whether minds are  &quot;things,&quot; the ontological status of propositions, sense-data vs.  &quot;adverbial&quot; accounts of sensory experience, the existence (or  otherwise) of qualia, the meaning(s) of rationality, the relevance of these  possible meanings to the claims of empirical research, the nature of  intentionality, John Searle's famous &quot;Chinese room&quot; experiment,  and the meaning of &quot;free will.&quot; (This last topic is one of  several that might not ordinarily be regarded as part of the  &quot;philosophy of mind.&quot; Lowe acknowledges as much but finds good  reason to discuss the experiments of Benjamin Libet -- the ones that  appeared to show  that certain choices actually _followed_ certain changes  in the brain by as much as a fifth of a second.)<br /> Here as elsewhere,  Lowe's great strength is his ability to make issues clear, including his  uncanny skill in raising a broad range of possibilities and objections  within a just few paragraphs or pages without sacrifice of depth. I really  don't know how to convey, in a short review, the remarkable effectiveness  of Lowe's exposition; suffice it to say that he is a gifted prose stylist  whose straightforward clarity is admirably suited to philosophical  material.<br /> In short, this volume is a wonderfully clear presentation of  its title topic, suitable to readers of any philosophical commitment or  none. Lowe's own views are quite defensible in their own right, of course,  and readers may be led to consult his other works (of which I have also  reviewed his excellent book _Locke on Human Understanding_). However, quite  apart from agreement on particular issues, any reader seeking an  introduction to the philosophy of mind can hardly find a better, fairer, or  more thorough guide than Lowe. I can't praise this workmanlike volume  enough.extremely thorough.

In this engaging and well-written volume, Thomas Nagel squeezes a good deal of political mileage out of his perpetual distinction between the personal and impersonal points of view. Here he finds a difficulty striking  the right balance between -- as his title suggests -- equality and  partiality.<br /><br />His contention is that when I abstract from my pursuit of  my own values, I am able to see myself as just one person among others and  recognize that -- in an absolute, view-from-nowhere sense -- other persons  are just as &quot;important&quot; as I am. Thus arises a conflict within  myself between the &quot;personal&quot; and &quot;impersonal&quot; points  of view -- or between partiality toward my own values and interests, on the  one hand, and impartiality, on the other.<br /><br />Nagel is careful to note  that he is _not_ arguing against personality/partiality altogether. On the  contrary, he thinks there is an important place in the world for purely  agent-relative values. He just doesn't think that's all there are.<br /><br />Nor  is he primarily interested in drawing conclusions; his main concern is to  try to set out the issues clearly. And at any rate, his main (tentative)  conclusion is the comparatively tame one that it is possible and desirable  to establish social institutions which provide a guaranteed minimal level  of well-being to everyone. (I entirely agree that this would be a Good  Thing, assuming that I am allowed to construe &quot;social  institutions&quot; in the broadest possible fashion. But it is a long leap  from &quot;not, strictly speaking, morally optional&quot; to &quot;properly  mandated by the positive law of the State,&quot; and I do not see that  Nagel makes that leap any more effectively than Alan Gewirth.)<br /><br />And  although he follows Parfit in giving the greatest weight to improvements  for the worst off, he is not in favor of forcibly &quot;equalizing&quot;  everyody in a Harrison-Bergeron sort of way. (But don't worry; libertarians  will find plenty to disagree with all the same.)<br /><br />The heart of his case  is the alleged conflict between personal and impersonal viewpoints. I take  it that he thinks some, but not all, of our &quot;personal&quot; values  will survive the transition to the &quot;impersonal&quot; point of view.  The ones that survive this transition are, roughly, the ones it might be  okay to tax people in support of.<br /><br />Now, frankly, Nagel's perceived  difficulty seems to arise from a miscasting of the problem. On the one  hand, surely all values are &quot;agent-relative&quot; in the minimal sense  that (a) every value depends (as Nagel himself admits) on the existence of  at least one valuing agent, and (b) every intrinsic value is realized or  actualized in someone's experience. (I am not sure whether Nagel follows  W.D. Ross, as I do, in holding that all intrinsic goods are states of mind  or relations between them.)<br /><br />On the other hand, surely there is also an  &quot;impartial&quot; point of view from which we can see, and say, that  (other things equal) the fulfillment of agent-relative values is simply  _good_, period. In this sense, even the most irreducibly personal (and  otherwise unproblematic) value is _also_ an &quot;impersonal&quot; value  which any rational agent can see to be, _ceteris paribus_, worth fulfilling  for its own sake -- i.e., an intrinsic good. In that case the  &quot;personal-ness&quot; of a value is strictly a matter of degree; its  &quot;impersonal-ness&quot; is not; and the two are not even contraries,  let alone mutually exclusive.<br /><br />If that is right, then the real problem  Nagel is addressing is not a conflict between agent-relative and  agent-neutral values at all (his distinction between which Christine  Korsgaard has criticized on other grounds in &quot;The Reasons We Can  Share,&quot; reprinted in _Creating the Kingdom of Ends_). It is the  arguably more manageable problem of how individualagents are to set  priorities among their values (including those they ideally should  have).<br /><br />Which raises the corollary question of how far individual  agents become _responsible_ for one another's well-being simply through the  rational insight that such well-being is &quot;good, period.&quot; For  _ceteris_ is seldom _paribus_, and it is just not the case that insight  into an intrinsic good necessarily imposes an obligation on the possessor  of the insight.<br /><br />It is obviously possible to recognize the intrinsic  goodness of a past event without thereby becoming obliged to bring about  what has, after all, already occurred. It is also possible to recognize the  intrinsic goodness (or otherwise) of a possible future event without  thereby obliging oneself to make it happen (or prevent it); even if this is  a _prima facie_ duty, it is easily overruled. Your trip to the dentist will  no doubt produce some pain (an intrinsic evil), but you are not therefore  obliged to refrain from going; still less am I obliged to prevent you. And  without sorting through the messy matter of personal responsibility, we  cannot simply conclude that the &quot;impersonal&quot; point of view  imposes any particular obligations on particular persons.<br /><br />But I don't  think Nagel quite comes to grips with the question of personal  responsibility/duty, and I suspect this is because, as Korsgaard notes, he  is really a &quot;consequentialist&quot; rather than a Kantian: he thinks  ethics is for the sole purpose of _bringing about some overall result_. If  this view is denied, and especially if his distinction between  &quot;personal&quot; and &quot;impersonal&quot; values is also found  wanting, then his argument is an extended _ignoratio elenchi_.<br /><br />There  are other difficulties: for example, his Rawlsian contention that people do  not &quot;deserve&quot; their talents, the difficulty or impossibility of  meaningfully measuring equality of outcome, and the fact that so much of  his discussion takes place at the level of the &quot;collective.&quot; But  space will not permit discussion of those.<br />In any case, though, I agree  with reviewer Chris Cathcart (below) that Nagel's work should be read by  political theorists of all stripes.

And it  is brilliantly argued. My sole major objection concerns not what is there,  but what is missing.<br /><br />Lomasky differentiates between  &quot;univalent&quot; and &quot;multivalent&quot; theories of rights -- the  former being those that single out one feature that qualifies certain  beings as rights-bearers, the latter allowing for more than one feature  that might do so. His own theory is technically &quot;multivalent&quot; but  depends fundamentally on just one feature: the ability to &quot;pursue  projects&quot; -- i.e. to have aims and ends that have a specially  motivating status for oneself because they are one's own.<br /><br />That human  beings are &quot;project pursuers&quot; is, for Lomasky, the point that  does in utilitarianism and other overarching-common-end sorts of ethic; he  takes it that such theories are unable to give sufficient account of the  fact that agents have special reasons for pursuing their _own_ ends.<br /><br />Frankly, this is a questionable beginning. He is surely on firm  ground in basing our rights against one another on the fundamentally  teleological features of human life. But that my &quot;projects&quot; pose  special reasons for _me_ to act does not in any way imply that they pose no  reason for you _at all_. It seems entirely meaningful to speak of a  &quot;common end&quot; shared by rational agents as such, coherently  inclusive of the &quot;projects&quot; of all such individuals; that each  individual has a unique _prioritization_ of reasons does not mean that each  individual has a distinct _set_ of reasons.<br /><br />Perhaps your  self-actualization as a brilliant jazz drummer is supremely important to  you and only marginally important to me. But if even one of my goals as a  rational agent is to help bring &quot;good things&quot; into the world, can  we say that -- other things equal -- your goal is simply _irrelevant_ to  me?<br /><br />No matter how many other actual goals I may have that (quite  properly) take precedence over my helping you to become a self-actualized  jazz drummer, it is still the case that, if I had no conflicting goals of  my own, I _would_ have reason to pursue your actualization. It also,  therefore, seems to be the case that I  have such reason even when it is  not my controlling reason, i.e. when it is outweighed by my legitimate  pursuit of  my own &quot;projects.&quot; My reasons, like W.D. Ross's  &quot;_prima facie_ duties,&quot; do not simply disappear merely because  they are outweighed by other reasons.<br /><br />Some versions of utilitarianism  and idealism, then, remain standing even after Lomasky's attack; a defender  of either could easily argue that Lomasky is entirely right without  abandoning his/her own position. The utilitarian could say that,  _therefore_, utilitarianism should make it a(n impartial!) &quot;rule&quot;  that each person should pursue primarily his or her own  &quot;projects.&quot; The idealist could say that, _therefore_, an ethic of  ideal self-actualization should take care to regard the ideal common end of  humanity as coherently (and impartially!) inclusive of, not a replacement  for, the individual project-pursuits of individual persons.<br /><br />In either  case, Lomasky has not said anything that ultimately tells against the  theory in question; he has simply pointed out an important feature that  must not be omitted from either account if it is to remain credible. This  is of course no small achievement in its own right. But it leaves room for  -- say -- Brand Blanshard to argue that human beings do indeed have a  common ideal end which they nevertheless &quot;serve&quot; or  &quot;promote&quot; by becoming most completely themselves.<br /><br />Lomasky  implicitly acknowledges this point in a great deal of his discussion. He  acknowledges, for example, that the well-being of other project pursuers is  an _intrinsic_ good, _ceteris paribus_ worthy of pursuit for its own sake.  (Indeed he just about has to acknowledge this in order to make his argument  for rights, else no single project pursuer could have reason to respect  rights _as_ rights.) And he grants that the well-being of one  project-pursuer _does_, in and of itself, provide a reason for another  project-pursuer to act (at least under conditions which guarantee that the  other project-pursuer can understand what is at issue).<br /><br />But in that  case, it is entirely meaningful to say that our rights against one another  depend on a common end, so long as we are careful to understand that end in  the proper way. What Lomasky has shown -- and shown very well -- is that we  cannot take that &quot;common end&quot; as somehow imposed from the top  down and as superseding our individual projects; we must argue _up_ to it  by starting with individual projects and seeing what is involved in  rendering them ideally coherent. Our common &quot;transcendent&quot; end  does not trump our individual &quot;immanent&quot; ends but incorporates,  informs, and delimits them.<br /><br />To my own mind, bringing out this point  would have provided a more solid reply to the variety of liberalism that  recognizes a nonlibertarian role for the territorial State. And it would  have vastly improved on Ayn Rand's dismissal of the entire concept of a  &quot;common good.&quot;<br /><br />But none of this tells against Lomasky's  arguments for rights themselves -- only against his characterization of  what he calls the &quot;Foil&quot; position. And much of his  characterization of this Foil is altogether apt. His main worry is that it  insists that all moral decisions are to be made &quot;impartially&quot; and  therefore leaves no room for agents to be &quot;partial&quot; to their own  projects. In this he is surely raising a crucially important point, at  least about what &quot;impartiality&quot; means.<br /><br />What I think is  missing is a full recognition of Lomasky's own insight -- that the  fulfillment of individual projects by project-pursuers &quot;partial&quot;  to their own success is, in and of itself, an intrinsic good worthy of  promotion on quite impartial grounds. And to reach this point, we need only  follow Lomasky's own clear and cogent arguments to their logical  conclusions.in a great deal of his discussion.

This fine volume in the Cambridge &quot;Companions&quot; series is an essential aid to readers of Baruch Spinoza. Edited by Don Garrett, it includes ten essays on Spinoza's life and thought by ten world-class  Spinoza scholars (including the late Alan Donagan, to whom the book is  dedicated).<br />Topics covered are various and pretty much exhaustive. W.N.A.  Klever opens the volume with a summary of Spinoza's life and works; the  closing piece by Pierre-Francois Moreau traces the influence of  &quot;Spinozism&quot; from Spinoza's death through the twentieth century.  The eight essays in between discuss, in turn, Spinoza's metaphysics  (Jonathan Bennett), his theory of knowledge (Margaret D. Wilson), his  natural science and methodology (Alan Gabbey), his metaphysical psychology  (Michael Della Rocca), his ethical theory (Don Garrett), his political  theory (Edwin Curley, in a piece strikingly entitled &quot;Kissinger,  Spinoza, and Genghis Khan,&quot; in which he argues that Spinoza was  essentially Machiavellian), his theology (Alan Donagan), and his influence  on Biblical scholarship (Richard H. Popkin).<br />The resulting collection is  a clear and thorough examination of every essential aspect of Spinoza's  thought. My recommendation to new readers of Spinoza: begin with Roger  Scruton's fine little book in the &quot;Past Masters&quot; series, and then  go on to this one.	2000-06-10

Harry Austryn Wolfson's massive two-volume commentary on Baruch Spinoza was originally published in 1934, and it is still one of the best. It is certainly one of the most thorough: Wolfson leaves no stone unturned in his  examination of what Spinoza said and what he meant by it.<br />Locating  Spinoza on the cusp between the medieval and the modern worlds, he  maintains that Spinoza is at once the last of the medievals and the first  of the moderns. Tagging these two aspects of Spinoza's thought  &quot;Baruch&quot; and &quot;Benedictus,&quot; Wolfson argues that in order  to understand what &quot;Benedictus&quot; says, it is necessary to  reconstruct what has &quot;passed through the mind of Baruch.&quot;<br />And  that is just what Wolfson attempts to do. His work is a systematic and  basically self-explanatory presentation of what Spinoza said and thought,  with the _Ethics_ naturally taken as the central text in need of  explication. With monumental thoroughness, Wolfson dissects Spinoza's  writings on numerous matters of philosophy and theology and (most  helpfully) compares his thought on many points with that of Moses  Maimonides (whom Wolfson names as one of the three dominant influences on  Spinoza's thought, the other two being Descartes and -- sometimes  indirectly -- Aristotle). And in general, Wolfson's familiarity with  relevant Jewish philosophical literature is a tremendous asset put to good  use.<br />Wolfson concludes his examination with a chapter entitled,  &quot;What is New in Spinoza?&quot; Here he argues that Spinoza undertook  three &quot;acts of daring&quot; by way of repairing breaks within the  unity and homogeneity of nature as conceived by his predecessors: he  declared that God has the attribute of extension as well as of thought; he  denied design and purpose in God; and he insisted on the complete  inseparability of the soul from the body. That Spinoza thereby departed  from the traditional theologies of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and  what implications this departure has for Spinoza's rational theology, is  the subject of the remainder of the closing chapter.<br />In portions of his  work, Wolfson tends to rely on psychological rather than philosophical  explanation in order to set out why Spinoza holds certain views. This is in  some respects a defensible approach (and Wolfson, of course, does defend  it). However, Wolfson's work should probably be supplemented by a good  commentary on purely philosophical questions. It is too bad H.H.

Thomas Hill Green died of blood poisoning in 1882, and his arguably greatest work -- _Prolegomena to Ethics_, which he hadn't quite finished -- was published a year later under the editorship of A.C. Bradley. While  certainly not setting out a complete system of ethics, this great work  supplies both a refutation of &quot;empiricism&quot; and a metaphysical  foundation for ethics in rationalistic Idealism.<br />It is Green's  conviction, supported here by massive argumentation, that the world in  which we live cannot possibly be pieced together out of the sensations and  feelings upon which such earlier British philosophers as Locke had tried to  rely. On the contrary, our absolute presupposition in the possession of  anything deserving to be called &quot;knowledge&quot; is that the world in  which we live is an interconnected system, a whole bound together by  relations neither the existence nor the apprehension of which can be  accounted for in &quot;empiricist&quot; terms.<br />This world must, Green  argues, be the activity of a single Mind the activity of which we  reconstruct in some manner as we develop our own knowledge. And the  activity of this single Mind, he contends, is also the ground of our moral  life. This doctrine he applied to great effect in his _Lectures on the  Principles of Political Obligation_, in which he salvaged Rousseau's flawed  doctrine of the &quot;general will.&quot;<br />His reformulation of this  doctrine was influential on both Bernard Bosanquet and Brand Blanshard, and  in general his writings on ethics and political obligation mark a watershed  in the history of liberal political thought. Specifically, his departure  from Mill and Spencer marks the precise point at which liberalism began to  allow an increasingly active positive role for the State -- an issue, by  the way, on which I continue to disagree with him.<br />(For the record, I  would contend that the ideal &quot;evenly rotating economy&quot; of the  Austrian school of economics is a better expression of the &quot;general  will&quot; or &quot;rational will,&quot; at least as regards exchangeable  goods, than any State activity will ever be. However, I think Green's  metaphysics are basically sound and do in fact provide the proper  foundation for the liberal commonwealth. In any case, any critics of modern  liberalism will have to come to terms with Green at some point, and in my  view they will find much in his thought that is worth retaining.)<br />Green  has been criticized for failing to keep clear between two allegedly  different views: the view, on the one hand, that reality is _known_ through  intelligence, and the view, on the other, that real relations are  _constituted_ by the activity of intelligence. I do not think this  criticism is well-founded, but at any rate it is in this volume that Green  offers his fullest defense of the thesis in question.

What I disagree with is his all but  unquestioned assumption that &quot;welfare&quot; and other such activities  can be performed only by a &quot;supportive State.&quot;<br />On the contrary,  in my own view there is every reason -- moral and economic -- to leave  those activities to &quot;private&quot; (i.e. non-State) sources. Frankly,  having the State perform them has led only to the breakup of local  communities -- especially religious ones, who undertake such efforts as a  matter of observing religious law and who handle them more responsibly than  any State ever will.<br />Criticizing Gewirth's grasp of economics (e.g. his  remarks on &quot;full employment and inflation&quot;) would take me rather  far afield here, so I shall simply note that he disagrees with the  economists whose opinions I most respect.<br />However, my disagreements  aside, I do think Gewirth is a morally acute thinker who does absolutely  excellent work in ethical theory. I simply do not think he is the most  effective &quot;exporter&quot; of those theories into practical economics  and politics, where he tends to favor practices that, I think as a matter  of logic and history, tend to undermine the entirely legitimate goal of  promoting self-fulfillment.	2000-06-08

It is a distinctively philosophical problem demonstrated by the fact that people other than philosophers are generally unaware that  the problem even exists. Nevertheless, it is a real problem because  particulars are, and can only be, described by their characteristics. Such  characteristics are qualities and qualities are what are generally  understood to be universals. . . . [I]t is [also] indubitable that  relations exist . . . . Once it is understood that qualities and relations  are ontologically inescapble, it remains to determine the nature of such  beasts.&quot;<br />Thus Andrew Schoedinger introduces and motivates the  problem of universals -- the problem, that is, of characterizing the nature  and ontological status of qualities and relations that may be predicated of  more than one &quot;particular&quot; or occur identically in more than one  context.<br />And a thorough collection it is. The problem of universals did  not die during the Middle Ages; there are twenty-eight selections in this  volume, of which fully eighteen were originally published during the  twentieth century.<br />The first eleven essays carry us from Plato and  Aristotle through Abelard, Aquinas and Locke to Kant and Hegel; the baton  is then passed to Husserl and Heidegger, Russell and Ramsey, and fourteen  other recent philosophers. Each selection is introduced by a helpful  summary from Schoedinger.<br />One mildly irritating feature of this  collection is the absence of first names: Bertrand Russell is just  &quot;Russell,&quot; F.P. Ramsey is just &quot;Ramsey.&quot; The problem is  more acute for philosophers who are not exactly household names; the reader  who has never heard of e.g. H.H. Price, Nicholas Wolterstorff, or Richard  Aaron will have some difficulty locating further information on  them.<br />However, that is a small complaint which does not tell against the  excellence of the collection itself.

This Oxford Philosophical Texts student edition of George Berkeley's best known work features a helpful introduction, glossary, and notes by philosopher Jonathan Dancy (author of _Berkeley: An Introduction_ and  editor of the Oxford Philosophical Texts edition of Berkeley's _Treatise  concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge_). The forty-page introduction  includes a short biography of Berkeley, a synopsis of the _Dialogues_, a  summary and analysis of Berkeley's philosophy including critical discussion  of his main arguments, and an exposition of the relation between the  _Dialogues_ and the _Principles_. Also featured: a bibliography and an  analytical table of contents for the dialogues.<br />As for Berkeley himself,  he probably needs no introduction from me. Arguably the most judicious  commentary on his thought is that of T.H. Green, who in his great  _Introduction_ to Locke and Hume remarked as follows:<br />&quot;His  [Berkeley's] purpose was the maintenance of Theism, and a true instinct  told him that pure Theism, as distinct from nature-worship and daemonism,  has no philosophical foundation, unless it can be shown that there is  nothing real apart from thought. But in the hurry of theological advocacy,  and under the influence of a misleading terminology, he failed to  distinguish this true proposition -- there is nothing real apart from  thought -- from this false one, its virtual contradictory -- that there is  nothing other than feeling. The confusion was covered, if not caused, by  the ambiguity, often noticed, in the use of the term 'idea.' This to  Berkeley's generation stood alike for feeling proper . . . and for  conception, or an object thought of under relations. . . . Misled by the  phrase 'idea of a thing,' we fancy that idea and thing have each a separate  reality of their own, and then puzzle ourselves with questions as to how  the idea can represent the thing . . . . These questions Berkeley asked and  found unanswerable. There were two ways of dealing with them before him.  One was to supersede them by a truer view of thought and its object, as  together in essential correlation constituting the real; but this way he  did not take. The other was to avoid them by merging both thing and idea in  the indifference of simple feeling . . . -- an attempt which contradicts  itself, since it virtually admits [the] existence [of such oppositions as  inner and outer, subjective and objective] while it renders them  unaccountable.&quot; [_Hume and Locke_, 1968 Apollo edition, pp.  140-142.]<br />This summary may not be quite adequate to Berkeley's thought  overall, as later in life he does appear to have come round to a view not  altogether unlike Green's. However, it seems to me to be an eminently fair  assessment of the Berkeley represented in the present volume.<br />At any rate  Berkeley was a fascinating thinker and this volume is as good an  introduction to him as is available. The _Dialogues_ should eventually be  read in conjunction with the _Principles_ (which they were intended to  support), but anyone looking for a single volume in which to meet this  great and seminal philosopher will be safe in beginning with this one.o ways of dealing with them before him.

As he notes in his preface, Bradley was not trying to develop a complete system of moral philosophy or  even to determine what is the proper subject matter of that field. His  purpose was critical, and his target was utilitarianism.<br />However, his  work is probably more positive than he gave it credit for. While it is  undoubtedly not a full moral philosophy, he at least sketches the outlines  of an ethic of self-fulfillment that does not collapse into either  amorality or tautology.<br />Utilitarianism has moved on since Bradley's time  and its arguments and doctrines have not stood altogether still. But  Bradley's critiques of hedonism and its inability to provide a rule of life  are still trenchant; his dissection of &quot;duty for duty's sake&quot;  should still have the power to make Kantians squirm a bit; and his essay on  &quot;My Station and Its Duties&quot; is surely a classic of British moral  philosophy.<br />The meat of Bradley's own positive case, though, is presented  in the final two chapters, on &quot;Ideal Morality&quot; and  &quot;Selfishness and Self-Sacrifice.&quot; It would be a mistake to regard  &quot;My Station and Its Duties&quot; as Bradley's final word on ethics,  for he did not thus regard it himself. On the contrary, in his closing  chapters he sketches a view of the moral life as a life in which one's  &quot;good self&quot; is fulfilled by overcoming one's &quot;bad self&quot;  -- the former answering to our &quot;true being&quot; and the latter  incapable of being desired for its own sake. And this &quot;good self&quot;  is not simply or fully exhausted in our practical obligations.<br />Bradley  did not allow the book to be republished for many years after it had gone  out of print, but in later life he did begin to make notes toward a  reissue. This reissue was published in 1927, some three years after  Bradley's death, with the help of H.H. Joachim; this edition, which is the  one here made available, incorporates Bradley's rough notes as bracketed  additions.death, with the help of H.H.

In this brilliant work, Christine Korsgaard tackles her title topic with flair and vigor: What are the sources of normativity? How is it that we become morally obliged? Drawing heavily on Kant but also striking out on  her own, Korsgaard locates the origin of obligation in the ability to  reflect, and in particular to reflect upon oneself as an agent in the  pursuit of ends (a &quot;citizen of the Kingdom of Ends&quot;).<br />Her view  is at heart a modification of Kant, and she is careful to explain both what  her approach shares with Kant's and exactly what her departure consists of.  (Basically, finding some versions of &quot;reflective endorsement&quot;  untenable, she finds that she must modify Kant's abstract principle of  universalizability to take account of our need for practical  identity.)<br />There might seem to be a difficulty here in that (as one other  reviewer has noted in somewhat different language) agents who are _not_  (sufficiently) reflective might seem thereby to avoid moral obligation  altogether. However, Korsgaard does deal with this point and does at least  leave us a way to say that agents ideally _ought_ to be reflective. In that  sense, the agent who simply shrugs off the pain he is causing to another  can still, on Korsgaard's theory, be said to be reneging on an obligation.  (And I think we _would_ say that &quot;obligation&quot; could obtain no  purchase at all on someone who was simply incapable of any reflection  whatsoever.)<br />At any rate, whether Korsgaard's analysis is found to be  satisfactory or not, it makes highly rewarding reading. Her theory is not  only trenchantly presented but developed through an enlightening discussion  of the history of ethical theory.<br />Moreover, the text also includes  responses/critiques from Thomas Nagel, G.A. Gohen, Bernard Williams, and  Raymond Guess, with a final wrapup reply from Korsgaard (the entire volume  is adapted from a lecture series). And that helpful feature means that  certain important criticisms are made available to the reader at once,  together with Korsgaard's responses thereto.<br />(By the way, her arguments  with one or two of the other contributors will be clearer to the reader who  is familiar with _Creating the Kingdom of Ends_. For example, her  disagreements with Nagel over agent-relative vs. agent-independent reasons  are discussed in &quot;The Reasons We Can Share.&quot; And contrary to what  one of the other reviewers seems to believe, both Korsgaard and Nagel have  devoted sustained attention to the question of how &quot;reasons for  you&quot; are also &quot;reasons for me.&quot; Merely announcing that  &quot;they aren't&quot; is a way not of solving the problem but of refusing  to address it.)<br />All in all, then, this is a fine piece of work on the  part of Korsgaard and all her interlocutors. There is some excellent  ethical reasoning in this volume, and even readers who wind up disagreeing  with Korsgaard's solution will appreciate her fair and careful treatment of  the problem.ain important criticisms are made available to the reader at once,  together with Korsgaard's responses thereto.<br />(By the way, her arguments  with one or two of the other contributors will be clearer to the reader who  is familiar with _Creating the Kingdom of Ends_.

This is an excellent collection of readings on the philosophy of time. The contents include twelve essays by twelve different philosophers (including the editors of the volume) -- the very first of which is taken from the  famous thirty-third chapter of John McTaggart Ellis McTaggart's _The Nature  of Existence_. (Originally entitled &quot;Time,&quot; the chapter is here  retitled &quot;The Unreality of Time.&quot;)<br />I remarked in my review of  that book that McTaggart's argument has been tried and found wanting, but  one important partial exception is featured in this volume: D.H. Mellor's  piece &quot;The Unreality of Tense.&quot; Mellor does not, indeed, accept  McTaggart's conclusion that time itself is &quot;unreal,&quot; but he does  take McTaggart to have provided a successful argument for a  &quot;tenseless&quot; theory of time. (Mellor's piece is a revision of  chapter 6 of his book _Real Time_ -- the first edition, I presume.)<br />The  other essays range over a wide variety of topics, from David Lewis's  &quot;The Paradoxes of Time Travel&quot; to Michael Dummet's &quot;Bringing  About The Past,&quot; from whether time really &quot;passes&quot; or not  and whether the nature of time is a philosophical or an empirical question  to whether time has a beginning and whether change is real. I shall not try  to comment on them all.<br />But the selections are excellent and the  collection as a whole is very thorough. In short, this a fine set of  readings for anyone with time on his hands.	2000-06-08

The essays in this topical collection provide a thorough discussion of that question. Drawn mostly from contemporary philosophy, the collection nevertheless begins a bit further back: with Gottlob Frege's \\"Function  and Concept,\\" two contributions from Bertrand Russell, and F.P. Ramsey's \\"Universals.\\"<br /><br />More recent selections are included from  W.V.O. Quine (\\"On What There Is\\"), Frank Jackson, Michael Devitt,  D.M. Armstrong, Donald C. Williams, Keith Campbell, Chris Daly, David  Lewis, Sydney Shoemaker, and co-editor D.H. Mellor.<br /><br />The volume will be of  special interest to readers looking for sources on the problem of  universals. Naturally each contribution deals with the problem to some  extent, but particularly interesting is an exchange between Michael Devitt  and D.M. Armstrong. Nominalists and realists sometimes talk past each other  about this problem, and sure enough, much of the exchange between Devitt  and Armstrong has to do with (a) why nominalists don't think there really  _is_ a \\"problem\\" of universals and (b) why realists think  nominalists are being all but willfully blind.<br /><br />In a spirited but  cheerfully sporting verbal tennis match, Devitt responds to Armstrong's  complaints (in _Universals and Scientific Realism_) about \\"ostrich  nominalism\\" by attacking \\"mirage realism\\" instead. Armstrong  offers a rejoinder which he thinks improves on his earlier discussion. The  two part friends, with no injuries.<br /><br />There is also good discussion on  trope theory and \\"abstract particulars,\\" as one might expect  from the inclusion of essays by Williams, Campbell, and Daly. This is an  excellent collection both overall and in detail.<br /><br />It will be of interest  to readers of D.M. Armstrong's _Universals: An Opinionated Introduction_,  and it will also fit well alongside Andrew Schoedinger's topical collection  _The Problem of Universals_. (There is surprisingly little overlap between  Schoedinger's volume and the present one.

This slim volume contains Joachim's classic statement of the \\"coherence theory\\" of truth and knowledge, which was vastly influential on Brand Blanshard's own formulation of the same theory in _The  Nature of Thought_.<br /><br />Either volume should be a cure for recent  misstatements of the theory. Recent discussion has tended to characterize  \\"coherentism\\" (as contrasted with \\"foundationalism\\") in  terms that would have bewildered the Idealists as to whose theory was being  discussed. Joachim's coherence theory could, in today's terms, be described  as both \\"coherentist\\" and \\"foundationalist\\" in a sense,  and yet really as neither one.<br /><br />For the classical Idealist theory has  nothing to do with \\"propositions\\" (in the current sense of the term) and everything to do with judgments (from which \\"propositions,\\" to the extent that they can  meaningfully be discussed at all, are abstractions). On the Idealist view, and especially on the view elaborated by Joachim, a judgment just _is_ part  of the self-development of reality, and the act/object dichotomy is a bad dream induced by a diet of abstraction.<br /><br />On Joachim's view, what  \\"coheres\\" is _experience_ -- or more precisely (to borrow a bit from Bosanquet), the single tremendous \\"judgment\\" which, for each  of us, comprises the \\"world\\" forced upon us by experience. There is no question of abstract propositions cohering with one another and thereby gaining status as \\"truths.\\" (Joachim does write that only propositions are capable of truth or falsity, but by \\"proposition\\" he essentially _means_ the asserted content of an actual or possible judgment.)<br /><br />Truth, for Joachim, is a  matter of degree -- roughly, a measure of how much a judgment would have to  be modified in order to fit into the systematic whole toward which  reflection strives. And as he notes in _Logical Studies_, the possibility  of false _propositions_ is neither here nor there as far as this theory is  concerned; his claim (and the Idealists' claim generally) is that no  _judgment_ is purely/wholly true or false just as it presently stands, not  that it's impossible to make up a pure falsehood that isn't forced on  anyone by experience anyway.<br /><br />Is the theory defensible? I'll let the  reader decide -- and I recommend a look at _The Philosophy of Brand  Blanshard_ for some of Blanshard's later modifications and retractions of  his own theory. But at any rate Joachim's little book is an invaluable  source for what the theory really says.that no  _judgment_ is purely/wholly true or false just as it presently stands, not  that it's impossible to make up a pure falsehood that isn't forced on  anyone by experience anyway.

In this massive two-volume work, Bernard Bosanquet offers what is arguably  the most complete development of Idealist logic ever set to  paper.<br />Idealist logic has fallen out of fashion, though perhaps with  little excuse. More or less &quot;analytic&quot; philosophers become  exercised every now and then over the ontological status of propositions;  perhaps they should remind themselves of an earlier tradition that began  instead with the _judgment_ and never allowed the divorce between mind and  reality which seemed to confer independent existence on the wraithlike  entities with which propositional logic deals.<br />For Bosanquet, as for the  Idealists generally, there is not &quot;knowledge&quot; over here, on the  one hand, and the reality it is &quot;about&quot; over there, on the other.  As he puts it later (in _Implication and Linear Inference_), knowledge just  _is_ reality itself _qua_ known, and that same reality is in some manner  &quot;constituting and maintaining itself in the form of truth&quot; in the  very process of becoming and being known.<br />The knowledge of which logic is  the reflective analysis, as H.H. Joachim develops this view in _Logical  Studies_, is not something &quot;in&quot; the mind, on the one hand, and  opposed to the reality it is &quot;about,&quot; on the other; there is just  &quot;knowledge-or-truth&quot; in some process of self-fulfillment or  self-development, which simply _is_ reality manifesting itself; reality may  be more than this self-development, but it is not less. And it is _this_  logic -- not abstract formal logic but the logic of reality's own  &quot;self-development&quot; -- which Bosanquet discusses at length in this  classic work.<br />Undoubtedly this way of putting things will sound strange  to modern readers, at least those who have not steeped themselves in the  Idealist tradition. But in its way this approach to logic seems strangely  and naively correct; is there really a difference between reality &quot;in  itself&quot; and reality &quot;as we understand it&quot;? Granted that the  latter is always incomplete, but is it really of a different _character_  from reality altogether? If so, how do we come to &quot;know&quot; anything  at all?<br />At the very least, Idealist logic deserves a second look in view  of the paradoxes to which formal &quot;propositional&quot; logic leads. And  there is no better place to start than this great work, now all but  forgotten.<br />Warning: Bosanquet is not the clearest writer ever born. It  will be helpful to have a copy of -- say -- H.H. Joachim's aforementioned  _Logical Studies_ at hand in order to work out what in the world Bosanquet  is talking about.<br />Another helpful source is Brand Blanshard's _The Nature  of Thought_, which in many respects advances the Idealist argument into  genuinely new territory. Blanshard later modified (indeed, all but  abandoned) his view that an idea just _is_ its object _in posse_ and would,  if developed, simply become identical with its object. But whether he  should have abandoned that view or not (I personally suspect not), his  development of it in _The Nature of Thought_ will be helpful to the reader  who wants to get a handle on Bosanquet.&quot;in  itself&quot; and reality &quot;as we understand it&quot;?

These figures include -- among others -- Albert Jay Nock (who was in fact regarded as a &quot;leftist&quot; for part  of his career), H.L. Mencken, Frank Chodorov (born Fishel Chodorovsky --  did you know that? I didn't), Garet Garrett (author of _The Driver_, which  Raimondo argues may have been an important unacknowledged source for Ayn  Rand's ATLAS SHRUGGED), John T. Flynn (who among other things wrote a  scathing expose of Roosevelt and the &quot;New Deal&quot;), Rose Wilder  Lane (author of _The Discovery of Freedom_), and Isabel Paterson (author of  _The God of the Machine_ and the former guru of Ayn Rand).<br />Raimondo also  discusses the hijacking of the Right by Bill Buckley and the  neoconservatives, doing a much better job than Rand did in her little puff  piece, &quot;Conservativism: An Obituary.&quot; In fact Raimondo is careful  to acknowledge all the genuine conservatives Rand left out of her  &quot;obituary&quot;; rather than simply declaring conservatism dead, as  Rand did, Raimondo wants to recover it from the people who almost destroyed  it in favor of militaristic Statism.<br />Raimondo also discusses some genuine  contemporary conservatives, including the late great Murray Rothbard  (Raimondo is also the author of a soon-to-be-published biography of  Rothbard), and provides a ringing defense of Pat Buchanan against a number  of unfair attacks -- though he also harshly criticizes Buchanan's stand  against free international trade. (The back of the book features an  endorsement from Buchanan, by the way -- a little tribute to the  intellectual integrity of both men.)<br />His remarks on Rand will also be of  interest to bemused watchers of the &quot;Objectivist&quot; movement.  Despite some obvious respect for her talents as a novelist (he thinks, and  I agree, that _The Fountainhead_ was her best work and ATLAS SHRUGGED was  pretty kludgy), he does not spare the rod as regards her pretensions of  originality, her claim to stand within no pre-existing tradition  whatsoever, her intellectual fraud in each of these respects, her failure  to give proper credit even to those of her forebears who were directly  influential on her thought (Isabel Paterson being the primary example), and  her endorsement of several policies that would have been anathema to the  Old Right. I suspect that Raimondo would be happy -- and I know I would --  if Rand were publicly exposed as a pretentious, pseudophilosophical,  cult-mongering fraud, discredited as a representative of the  classical-liberal Right, and recognized as the &quot;leftist&quot; she  really was. (And any &quot;Objectivists&quot; reading this review are  hereby invited to click &quot;Not helpful.&quot;)<br />At any rate Raimondo's  workmanlike volume belongs on the shelf of anyone interested in recovering  the genuine tradition of liberty. His efforts to restore the memory of an  important and all but forgotten strain of American thought will be of  interest to libertarians and classical liberals everywhere.oes not spare the rod as regards her pretensions of  originality, her claim to stand within no pre-existing tradition  whatsoever, her intellectual fraud in each of these respects, her failure  to give proper credit even to those of her forebears who were directly  influential on her thought (Isabel Paterson being the primary example), and  her endorsement of several policies that would have been anathema to the  Old Right.

In the second edition of this volume, John L. Pollock and Joseph Cruz do a workmanlike job at a double task: (a) presenting a fairly comprehensive overview of contemporary epistemological theories (particularly in the  broad area where more-or-less-analytical philosophy meets cognitive  science), and (b) developing and defending an original theory of their  own.<br />(Note: Pollock has been working in epistemology for thirty-odd years  and Cruz is a recent Ph.D.; I take it that Pollock was probably the leader  in the work. I also don't happen to recall whether Pollock's was the only  name on the first edition. Nevertheless the theory propounded in this  volume marks important changes from Pollock's earlier views as presented in  his own previous publications. At any rate I shall continue to refer to the  theory developed herein as &quot;theirs.&quot;)<br />The presentation is  organized very well and developed with the utmost fairness. The reader is  introduced to the field of peistemology and taken on a guided tour of the  basic classes of epistemological theory.<br />The authors begin by dividing  theories of knowledge into two overarching classes: &quot;doxastic&quot;  theories (which hold that what one epistemologically ought to believe is a  function solely of one's current beliefs) and &quot;nondoxastic&quot;  theories (which think some consideration _other_ than one's current beliefs  is relevant to the question of what one ought to believe next). Having made  this distinction, the authors go on to discuss foundationalism and  coherentism as &quot;doxastic&quot; theories, finding what they regard as  insurmountable problems with each. (I disagree, by the way, but that is  neither here nor there.)<br />They regard their own theory (which they go on  to develop at length) as &quot;nondoxastic,&quot; a view at which they are  able to arrive by distinguishing between a perceptual state itself, on the  one hand, and beliefs _about_ such states, on the other. Here we might see  the glimmer of a possible problem: for our authors, a perceptual state is  not itself a belief state (at least, not solely).<br />But that problem pales  in comparison with another of the authors' main contentions (one which they  themselves recognize as all but heretical): that in order to be taken  seriously, a theory of knowledge should be implementable as a computer  alogrithm. However, &quot;heretical&quot; or not, the authors do a fine job  of defending their thesis, devoting several sections (e.g. &quot;How to  build a person&quot;) to a project dubbed OSCAR in which they try . . .  well, to build a person.<br />At any rate, whether one agrees or disagrees  with their conclusion, the volume is a terrific introduction to the current  state of epistemology -- with an absolutely outstanding bibliography into  the bargain. If you're interested in the field, don't miss this fine  contribution to it.we might see  the glimmer of a possible problem: for our authors, a perceptual state is  not itself a belief state (at least, not solely).<br />But that problem pales  in comparison with another of the authors' main contentions (one which they  themselves recognize as all but heretical): that in order to be taken  seriously, a theory of knowledge should be implementable as a computer  alogrithm.

How can it be that all of Halakha was given at Sinai, and yetthat each generation of rabbis is able to introduce innovations? IsHalakha &quot;all there at once&quot; in some Platonic sense, or does it come into existence via convention as Halakhic decisors render specific rulings on specific points?<br />Moshe Koppel thinks questions like these are insufficiently pondered and, when they _are_ asked, all too likely to receive a toe-in-the-dirt &quot;well-umm&quot; sort of reply. So in this slim volume he faces them head-on -- and answers them.<br />The sole other review on this page has already revealed where Koppel is headed with his argument. So I shall simply point out what that argument is. In essence it is this: intuition precedes formalization, and the latter can never fully exhaust the former. There is no conflict between the &quot;Platonic&quot; and &quot;conventionalist&quot; views of Halakha; indeed both of them are true.<br />Koppel supports this contention with clear and deft discussions of certain limitative results from modern mathematical logic. And (no surprise here) he acknowledges a great debt to Rav Joseph Dov Soloveitchik ztz&quot;l.<br />Readers of the Rav's _Halakhic Man_ and _The Halakhic Mind_ will probably enjoy this book tremendously. Indeed, it is hard not to speculate that the Rav would have enjoyed it himself.(...)	2000-05-22

I wouldn't have thought it was possible to write a _worse_ book on &quot;Objectivist epistemology&quot; than Rand herself wrote. But I was wrong; Tom Porter has managed it.<br />If you're looking for a book written by  someone who possesses less than a college-freshman-level understanding of  philosophy, who thinks that historically important philosophers have been  pretty much one and all dishonest or stupid or both, and who grinds his  antiphilosophical axe under the name of Ayn Rand while providing even fewer  references and explanations than Rand herself bothered to provide, then  this is the book for you. But if you're looking for a book that actually  evinces a faint glimmer of hope that something in Rand's hodgepodge of an  epistemology _might_, on one or two points, be modified into something  barely salvageable at the hands of someone with some philosophical  competence, try David Kelley's _The Evidence of the Senses_ instead. This  book ain't it.<br />Of course, this book will be of tremendous interest to  people who want to see a fairly typical example (which Kelley is not) of  the &quot;philosophical&quot; pretensions of Rand's die-hard followers. So  perhaps its publication isn't a _total_ loss.<br />Space won't permit me to  detail everything that's wrong with this book (I tried once, but Amazon  didn't post the review, presumably for reasons of length). But I reviewed  it some time ago for the Daily Objectivist at the request of editor David  Brown, and I've made the review available on my own website.<br />If you'd  like to read it, go to my &quot;About You Page&quot; and click on the  personal-info section; I give the URL of my site there.

Despite his uncannily high volume of scholarly output, Nicholas Rescher is incapable of writing a bad or uninteresting book. And there is much of great interest in _Realistic Pragmatism_.<br />There are some minor  difficulties which have to do more with the editorial process than with the  content. First of all, the book seems to have more than its share of  spelling and grammatical errors. (Some more or less typical examples:  &quot;Hypotheses&quot; is given a singular verb on p. 6. On p. 251 we  encounter the following sentence: &quot;And so, while a pragmatism of  limited objective (be it cognitive or psychological or social) makes  perfect sense in its own domain, but that nowise entitles it to claims of  predominance -- let alone sufficiency or exclusivity -- across the  board.&quot; And the name of Susan Haack is consistently misspelled  &quot;Haak&quot; -- rather surprisingly, since Rescher regards her as an  ally in his battle for a &quot;pragmatism of the right.&quot;)<br />Moreoever,  Rescher, usually a fine writer, is at his most awkwardly Latinate  throughout much of this volume and occasionally lapses into prose that  would be at home on the overhead projector in a business management  seminar. (For example, we are told on p. 11 that owing to biological  evolution, Charles Sanders Peirce's pragmatic view of truth is  &quot;comprehensively coordinated to effective implementation.&quot; For my  taste, at least, there is altogether too much of this sort of  thing.)<br />These minor stylistic annoyances aside -- and that is all they  are -- Rescher has written a very thought-provoking book here. His basic  goal is to rescue pragmatism from some modern and post-modern philosophers  who have adopted that rubric (mostly Richard Rorty). In order to further  this goal, Rescher wishes to distinguish firmly between a hard-minded  &quot;pragmatism of the right&quot; (which he favors) from a woolly  &quot;pragmatism of the left&quot; (which he wishes would go away).<br />And  so he sets out to defend pragmatism against a host of real and hypothetical  foes. He argues by turns that his brand of methodological pragmatism has  something useful to say about scientific inquiry, the philosophy of  language, and the pursuit of value (and not merely &quot;crass  materialism,&quot; which seems to be a bogey of Rescher's); that pragmatism  is not in any way an enemy of metaphysical realism or a friend of  subjectivism or relativism; and -- especially -- that pragmatism took a  wrong turn under the management of William James and should make pilgrimage  back to its Peircean roots.<br />He actually begins with this last, and his  thesis here underlies most of the book. In a footnote on p. 9, for example,  he notes that &quot;one point that separates [Peirce] from William  James&quot; is that Peirce identifies the meaning of a conception with what  follows from its _truth_, not with what follows from _believing_ it is  true. This is apparently supposed to be the watershed that irrevocably  divides the pragmatism Rescher favors from the wrongheaded perversions of  Rorty et alia.<br />Unfortunately Rescher seems to me to be on very weak  ground here. Constantly reminding us that pragmatism bases itself on  success in practical action, he seems to lose sight of the fact that even  in Peirce's hands, practical success tends to be identified with things  with which it is simply not identical.<br />For example, Peirce's essay  &quot;How To Make Our Ideas Clear&quot; (cited by Rescher in the  aforementioned passage) does indeed tell us that the meaning of an idea  consists of what would follow from it if it were true. (&quot;Our idea of  anything,&quot; Peirce writes, &quot;_is_ our idea of its sensible  effects.&quot;) But this is actually a liability.<br />In what seems to be his  eagerness to scotch metaphysical speculation, Peirce has set out to deal  with ideas and beliefs in the same manner, and yet has also told us that to  clarify a _belief_ (as opposed to an idea) we are to consider the  consequences, not of the belief's object, but of our taking the belief to  be true. James may well have given this latter portion of Peirce's  &quot;pragmaticism&quot; too much weight, but _that_ he found this doctrine  in Peirce is hardly in question. If anything, he adopted it with greater  consistency than Peirce himself did.<br />At any rate, Peirce's own  formulation, even as regards ideas, rests on a confusion (and one which  heavily influenced logical positivism's misbegotten &quot;verifiability  theory of meaning&quot;). For the _consequences_ of a particular state of  affairs are surely not identical with the state of affairs itself; the  meaning of an idea is to be found, not in something which follows from the  idea's object, but in the object itself. As Brand Blanshard phrased it with  characteristic wit, Peirce's claim here is in effect that &quot;to think  clearly about something, the best way is to think about something  else&quot; [_Reason and Analysis_, p. 196].<br />Despite Rescher's tremendous  acuity, I do not see that his defense of Peirce manages to clear up this  fundamental confusion --  nor, therefore, ultimately to justify his claims  for &quot;methodological&quot; pragmatism (which, in this volume at least,  seem to consist mainly of telling us in general terms what pragmatism could  or should do rather than actually telling us how to go about  it).<br />Nevertheless, Rescher's volume is generally a goldmine of helpful  insights and provocative suggestions. I have long thought that Rescher is  at his very best in getting clear on foundational issues, making basic  distinctions, and setting up helpful classification schemes. There is quite  a bit of that in this book, and it is characteristically clear and well  constructed even if it does not quite meet Rescher's usually high standards  of expository prose. In this sense the book is a clear success on its own  terms: whatever we think about its metaphysical foundations, its  contributions to practical reason are undeniable.<br />Readers who are  interested in Rorty's relation to pragmatism (and especially to Peirce)  might also enjoy Susan Haack's _Manifesto of a Passionate Moderate_, in  which (along with much else) Haack presents an imaginary dialogue between  Rorty and Peirce consisting of contrasting excerpts from the writings of  the two men.lief_ (as opposed to an idea) we are to consider the  consequences, not of the belief's object, but of our taking the belief to  be true.

He succeeds at both  jobs.<br />Prager's basic contention is that ethical monotheism is the  necessary foundation of all moral thought and practice. While ethical  monotheism was revealed to and through the Jewish people, it does not  demand that everybody in the world convert to Judaism; however, Jewish  thought has traditionally set aside a group of ethical laws (called the  &quot;Noahide laws&quot;) which are binding on all humankind. (Here he is  of course on very solid ground.)<br />Throughout this work, Prager -- who  describes himself as a &quot;passionate moderate&quot; -- applies the  insights of traditional, historic Judaism to a host of pertinent social  issues, thinking the issues through carefully and insightfully to sometimes  surprising conclusions.<br />I won't discuss his conclusions in this review  because that would undermine one of Prager's purposes in writing the book  in the first place. Having spent so many years working in the media, he's  not expecting many (or even any) of his readers to agree with him about  everything; though of course he is committed to his own particular  conclusions, what he _most_ wants to do here is to stimulate thought and  debate.<br />He's good at it, so I'm going to leave that job to him. If you  want to know what he thinks -- or, more importantly, _how_ he thinks --  you're just going to have to read the book!	2000-05-10

You care for and love other people when they add  to your life, (i.e. you buy your kids presents for Christmas because it  makes YOU happy to see them happy, you are doing it for  yourself).&quot;<br />Yep, that's pretty whack. To understand what's wrong  with it, consider a simple example.<br />I want to eat a piece of cake. Eating  a piece of cake will make me happy. Does that mean what I really want is  happiness?<br />Hardly. &quot;Happiness&quot; isn't some hard little nugget of  something-or-other that can be pursued in various ways -- as though I get  out of bed in the morning, notice that I have a taste for  &quot;happiness,&quot; and fetch around for something that will give it to  me. The &quot;happiness&quot; in question here is specifically the  happiness _of_ eating a piece of cake; what I &quot;want&quot; is not  &quot;happiness&quot; but just to eat the cake.<br />A straightforward enough  confusion, and one pointed out long ago by T.H. Green against the  &quot;utilitarians&quot; of his time. But consider the same criticism  applied to the present case.<br />We care about other people because they make  us happy, we are told. So when I pursue your well-being, what I'm really  pursuing is my own happiness.<br />Getting whacker by the minute. In pursuing  your well-being, what I &quot;want&quot; is not &quot;happiness,&quot; but  _your well-being_. Do I care about your well-being because it makes me  happy -- or does your well-being make me happy because I care about it for  some other reason?<br />You decide. But this whackness is a perfect example of  Rand's attempt to reduce other-regard to a matter of sheer prudence. Her  &quot;philosophy&quot; leaves us no way to care _directly_ about the  well-being of someone else -- surely an odd feature in a  &quot;philosophy&quot; that wassupposed to provide the true foundation of  both rights and benevolence. (And David Kelley's _Unrugged Individualism_  doesn't solve the problem either, though this review isn't the place to say  why.)<br />&quot;To say 'I love you,' one must first learn to say the  'I',&quot; wrote Rand.

Nicholas Rescher, probably the single most prolific author among contemporary philosophers, here provides a sturdy defense of objectivity based on the primacy and inevitability of practical reason.<br />His concern  here is with _epistemic_ objectivity -- that is, &quot;not with the  _subject matter_ of a claim but with its _justification_.&quot; What such  objectivity calls for, he contends, is &quot;not allowing the indications  of reason, reasonableness, and good common sense to be deflected by 'purely  subjective' whims, biases, prejudices, preferences, etc.&quot; As he is at  pains to show, objectivity does not rule out personal values and  commitments; indeed, if it did, there would be no hope of our achieving it,  as &quot;[t]he 'God's-eye view' on things is unavailable -- at any rate to  us.&quot; On the contrary, being &quot;objective&quot; is a matter of  proceeding, he says, &quot;how we _should_ -- and how reasonable people  _would_ -- proceed if they were in our shoes in the relevant  regards.&quot;<br />Objectivity hinges on rationality -- as a matter not  simply of logical coherence, but also &quot;of the intelligent pursuit of  circumstantially appropriate objectives.&quot; From its requirements  follows a sort of &quot;rational economy,&quot; the principles of which are  very obviously objective and universal although they may (and do) have  different applications in different situations.<br />On this foundation,  Rescher takes on a host of contemporary critics of objectivity --  anthropologists, historicists, sociologists of knowledge, personalists,  feminists, Marxists and class-interest theorists, post-modernists, and  social activists. He finds that each attack on objectivity involves a  misconstruing of what it is all about, and devotes the remainder of the  volume to showing why this is the case.<br />Space will not permit a summary  of the following ten chapters, in which Rescher deals by turns with various  sorts of relativism, places cognitive objectivity on a ground of  ontological objectivity, and argues that the &quot;self-reliance of  rationality is not viciously circular&quot; -- objectivity and rationality  are self-supporting in a _virtuously_ circular fashion.<br />As always,  Rescher's presentation is clear and cogent.

This is the broad question that epistemologist William Alston addresses in this work; the title topic -- the reliability of sense perception -- he holds to be a special case of the reliability of basic doxastic  (belief-forming) practices generally.<br />&quot;Sense perception,&quot; as  Alston deals with it here, covers a variety of more or less customary ways  of forming beliefs, and Alston designates the whole lot of them as  &quot;sensory perception practice&quot; (abbreviated SP throughout most of  the work). The problem he faces to begin with is that there does not seem  to be a _noncircular_ demonstration that SP is reliable in this way.  (Though admitting that not all circularity is vicious, he nevertheless  decides to avoid circular arguments himself and -- rather too summarily, I  think -- dismisses coherence theories &quot;without a hearing&quot; for the  purposes of this work.)<br />He devotes the bulk of the work to considerations  of various sorts of argument for the reliability of SP -- simple  &quot;track record&quot; and pragmatic arguments, _a priori_ arguments  including theological ones, and empirical arguments. The burden of his own  argument here is essentially to show (a) that the noncircularity problem  affects all direct arguments for the reliability of SP, and (b) that this  problem is not unique to SP but affects _all_ of our usual ways of forming  beliefs.<br />His concluding chapter takes an interesting tack. He contends  that even though it is not possible to offer a _direct_ (noncircular)  argument that SP is reliable, nevertheless practical rationality shows that  it _is_ rational to &quot;engage in SP (and other doxastic practices)&quot;  -- that is, practical reason demands that we do go ahead and form our  beliefs in the ordinary accepted ways. His claim at this point is that,  although he has not shown that SP _is_ reliable, he has shown that it is  rational to _suppose_ SP to be reliable.<br />His distinction here is one that  he takes to be crucial, so it will be as well to spell it out precisely.  His claim, he says, is not that in judging SP to be rational, he is thereby  _judging_ that it is rational to  suppose that SP is reliable; his claim is  that the judgment that SP is rational _is itself a commitment_ to the  rationality of judging SP to be reliable.<br />Got that? Well, for further  elaboration you'll have to read the book itself. At any rate, his  conclusion is that SP is just one of a whole host of doxastic practices in  which it is _practically_ rational to engage; he has not, as he readily  admits, shown that it is rational &quot;in an _epistemic_ sense&quot; to  judge that SP is reliable.<br />After a brief discussion of why this sort of  rationality is relevant and more or less sufficient, he turns in closing to  a short survey of ways in which this rationality might be undermined (by  &quot;overriders of prima facie rationality&quot;) or supported (by  &quot;significant self support&quot;). His final remark is that there is  some urgency about deciding how to regard doxastic practices which can be  neither avoided nor shown to be reliable.<br />The argument of this volume is  a development of his work in _Perceiving God_, in the third chapter of  which he discussed the impossibility of proving SP reliable in a  noncircular way. At bottom the present work is an expanded version of that  chapter, offered -- as Alston says -- to &quot;philosophers who would not  open a book entitled _Perceiving God_&quot; but might find the argument on  sense perception interesting in its own right.<br />Those potential readers  might include some from the &quot;Objectivist&quot; camp -- at least those  who recognize the woeful inadequacies in Ayn Rand's own  sweep-it-under-the-rug policy on the question Alston here addresses.

And the _Oxford Companion to Philosophy_ (edited by Ted  Honderich) is an excellent general reference which no student of philosophy  should be without.<br />(The Routledge Contemporary Introductions to  Philosophy series seems to be very good in general, by the way; Michael  Loux's _Metaphysics_ is also highly recommended.)	2000-05-07

Christine Korsgaard's _Creating the Kingdom of Ends_ is a fine exposition and elaboration of the ethics of Immanuel Kant.<br />Consisting of thirteen essays published over the course of a decade or so, the volume is divided  into two parts: seven essays mainly dedicated to expounding (and  occasionally tweezing) Kantian ethics itself, and six essays  comparing/contrasting Kant's moral philosophy with those of Aristotle,  Henry Sidgwick, G.E. Moore, David Hume, Bernard Williams, Thomas Nagel, and  Derek Parfit.<br />There's plenty of good stuff in here. First of all,  Korsgaard's exposition of Kant will be of interest to anyone who has ever  tried to read Kant himself and wants to know what his moral philosophy is  really all about. Second, her critiques of other moral philosophers are  sharp and trenchant. For example, her destined-to-be-a-classic essay,  &quot;The reasons we can share: An attack on the distinction between  agent-relative and agent-neutral values,&quot; is a close and critical  reading of Thomas Nagel's _The Possibility of Altruism_ and _The View from  Nowhere_. All in all, this is contemporary moral philosophy at its  finest.<br />The entire volume is also, by the way, a nice cure for the  misrepresentations of pseudophilosopher Ayn Rand, who tried her darnedest  to give Kant a bad name in order to make room for a  more-or-less-Nietzschean ethical subjectivism she called (chuckle)  &quot;Objectivism.&quot;<br />(I mention that because somebody is going  through all my reviews and clicking &quot;Not helpful&quot; on any in which  I say anything negative about Rand.

This is a marvelous collection of columns and speeches by Jewish conservative Don Feder, on topics from family and feminism to abortion and euthanasia. Worth the price of the book is Feder's speech &quot;Does  Judaism Have a Mission to Humanity?&quot; It most certainly does, he  argues, and it isn't to bring the message of messianic secularism. The Jews  are supposed to serve as a moral example to the rest of the world by  observing the specifically Jewish mitzvot and by teaching the laws of the  Noahide Covenant to non-Jews.<br />&quot;This, ladies and gentlemen,&quot; he  concludes, &quot;is the essence of the Jewish mission: to persuade humanity  that someone indeed is watching us, one to whom we all are ultimately  accountable. On the success or failure of this mission the fate of the  world hinges.&quot;<br />Amen. And all of Feder's writings turn on this  mission in one way or another, both in this volume and in his later _Who's  Afraid of the Religious Right?_ (and in his regular column, which  interested readers will find on the website of the Jewish World Review).  Handily smashing the idols of the modern, secularist left, Feder takes no  prisoners in his reclamation of the moral high ground for the  Judeo-Christian tradition which provides the foundation of United States  society and culture -- or did, before that culture was debased and it  became necessary to speak, as Feder's title does, of &quot;pagan  America.&quot;<br />There is a lot at stake here, and Feder knows it. He  writes with both passion and wit in expounding a wide range of conservative  positions, but at the center is his view of the Jewish mission as outlined  above -- a mission he is undoubtedly doing his bit to fulfill. A strong  voice in the &quot;culture war,&quot; he ranks with Rabbi Daniel Lapin and  Dennis Prager in clarity, moral vision, and plain good sense.<br />I don't  always agree with him on every single point, but I can't recommend him more  highly -- especially to those who have been duped into believing that  Judaism is somehow synonymous with left-liberalism. It isn't.ho have been duped into believing that  Judaism is somehow synonymous with left-liberalism. It isn't.	2000-05-07

Sir David Ross's _The Right and the Good_, first published in 1930, is a classic statement of modern deontological ethics. The question at issue here is: Which ethical term is primary -- &quot;right&quot; or  &quot;good&quot;? And Ross's answer is that &quot;right&quot; is  primary.<br />His own statement of his thesis is as follows: &quot;An act is  not right because it, being one thing, produces good results different from  itself; it is right because it is itself the production of a certain state  of affairs. Such production is right in itself, apart from any  consequence.&quot;<br />Not that we must perform &quot;right&quot; acts even  though the heavens fall. What Ross argues is that certain sorts of  &quot;right&quot; act are _prima facie_ duties, with morally binding  _claims_ on our attention that may nevertheless be overruled by other  considerations/duties.<br />In short, this volume is a clear and succinct  statement of a twentieth-century development of Kantian deontological  ethics, of interest to readers of (say) Thomas Nagel, Christine Korsgaard,  and Alan Gewirth -- and also to ethical consequentialists and teleologists  who want to understand what the opposition is all about. (Brand Blanshard,  himself a teleologist, offers a nice critique of Ross's views in _Reason  and Goodness_.)<br />It's also, by the way, a nice cure for the  misrepresentations of pseudophilosopher Ayn Rand, who tried her darnedest  to give &quot;duty&quot; a bad name in order to make room for a  more-or-less-Nietzschean ethical subjectivism she called (chuckle)  &quot;Objectivism.&quot;<br />(I mention that because somebody is going  through all my reviews and clicking &quot;Not helpful&quot; on any in which  I say anything negative about Rand.

Far from washing his hands, William Alston here undertakes to provide a defense of what is, after all, the most common-sense answer to this question. Offering up an account of what he calls \\"alethic [from the  Greek word for 'truth'] realism,\\" Alston maintains that a statement,  proposition, or belief is true precisely in case it states the way things  really are.<br /><br />By my reading, his account of truth falls somewhere between a  \\"deflationary\\" theory and a full-blown \\"correspondence\\"  theory. (Indeed, in his opening chapter, Alston briefly relates his own  theory to each of these, and is at particular pains to distinguish his  account from Alfred Tarski's superficially similar one.) And in what I take  to be an extremely important point, he insists that _propositions_ are the  primary bearers of truth-value and provides a brief discussion of the  ontological status of these interesting entities. (However, he concludes  that his account does not depend on any particular theory of the latter,  and also notes that his account would be essentially unchanged if something  else -- sentences, say -- were taken to be the primary  truth-bearers.)<br /><br />The meat of this volume consists of replies to various  _epistemic_ accounts of truth -- that is, those which would conflate  \\"truth\\" with some sort of epistemic status (Alston names  \\"justification, certainty, knowledge, rationality, general consensus .  . . \\"). Against such accounts, Alston insists that these epistemic  categories are all very nice (and no doubt important as regards knowledge  and its justification), but they form no part of the conception of truth  itself; \\"[n]othing more is required for the truth of [a] statement,  and nothing less will suffice,\\" than that the statement's content  actually _be_ the case.<br /><br />Many of his readers will be most interested in  his replies to the anti-realist views of Michael Dummett and Hilary Putman  in chapters 4-6, and indeed these replies are excellent. Moreover, his  seventh chapter is a fine piece of work which shows, among other things,  that \\"epistemic\\" conceptions of truth one and all presuppose his  own \\"alethic\\" account. And his closing chapter on the  _importance_ of truth is an effective reply to those who would de-emphasize  the concept for various reasons.<br /><br />However, my own interest is largely in  Alston's third chapter, in which he deals with \\"an epistemic objection  to alethic realism.\\" On the whole this is a fine chapter, in which he  shows (pretty successfully) that his \\"alethic realism\\" does not  require either \\"unmediated\\" or \\"infallible\\" access to  \\"facts.\\"<br /><br />My interest here is that he takes, as his foil, the  views of Brand Blanshard as expressed in his 1939 work, _The Nature of  Thought_. As I am a longtime reader and admirer of Blanshard, I must pick  on Alston a bit here.<br /><br />I must admit at once that _some_ (not by any means  most or all!) of Alston's points are very well taken. However, I think he  could have strengthened his case further if -- instead of imagining how  Blanshard _might_ have replied -- he had looked into how Blanshard _did in  fact_ reply.<br /><br />In fact _The Philosophy of Brand Blanshard_ would have  provided additional support to Alston's thesis, since Blanshard eventually  did come to the conclusion that the sui-generis relation between (true)  thought and its object is not adequately described as  \\"coherence.\\" For example, Alston contends that a rejection of his  alethic realism carries the price of a metaphysical commitment to absolute  idealism of a certain sort (\\"[t]he 'reality' to which thought refers  is simply thought itself in its ideal completion\\"). But this point  could well have been strengthened had he invoked Blanshard's later work to  show that _even_ such a commitment does not suffice to \\"tell against a  minimal realism about truth.\\"<br /><br />And with that, I'm done picking on  Alston. This volume is a fine contribution to philosophical discussion on  the nature of truth. Any among Alston's readers who are not professional  philosophers themselves might also enjoy, as a general reference, Richard  L. Kirkham's excellent _Theories of Truth: A Critical Introduction_.

Michael J. Loux's _Metaphysics: A Contemporary Introduction_ is an excellent introduction to the metaphysical issues which are of paramount importance in contemporary Anglo-Australo-American analytical  philosophy.<br />Another reviewer has already noted Loux's helpful treatment  (in Chapters 1 and 2) of realism vs. nominalism as regards universals; I  concur and shall therefore limit my summary here to other features of the  text.<br />Loux devotes Chapter 4 to a crucially important topic of which many  readers may not even have been aware: the ontological status of  _propositions_. Do properties, kinds, and relations cover all the sorts of  abstract entity whose existence we must admit, or do  &quot;propositions&quot; constitute another such class?<br />Loux dedicates  Chapter 5 to a discussion of _modality_ (necessity and possibility). In  particular, he provides a solid introductory discussion of possible-worlds  modalism.<br />And in chapters 3 and 6, Loux tackles the problem of the  &quot;concrete particular&quot; -- first in regard to what it is (the  subtitle of Chapter 3 is &quot;Substrata, bundles, and substances&quot;),  and second in regard to how such an entity persists through time  (endurantism, perdurantism, presentism, eternalism).<br />The presentation is  clear and accessible throughout, and each chapter is helpfully introduced  with a summary of its important points.

This competently-executed volume was once, briefly, the pride of the Objectivist movement -- a work of genuinely original philosophy along Randian lines, which held out the promise that &quot;Objectivism&quot;  might someday win something like academic respectability. I say  &quot;was,&quot; because its author, David Kelley, was booted out of the  movement for being willing to scold libertarians in person rather than just  in print.<br />It is no wonder his work came as such good news to Objectivism;  it really is a fairly original attempt to develop a realist theory of  perception. However, two common misconceptions must be disposed of at  once.<br />First of all, Kelley's theory is often described as &quot;direct  realism.&quot; But as we shall see below, his claim to this title is  questionable, and at any rate he does not use it himself.<br />Second, his  work is sometimes cited as _the_ &quot;Objectivist theory of  perception.&quot; It is no such thing.<br />It wants no little legerdemain to  extract a coherent doctrine of perception from the hodgepodge of Rand's own  writings on epistemology -- and Kelley, to his credit, does not try. Rand  is mentioned only twice in the text and twice more in the footnotes; the  word &quot;Objectivism&quot; does not even appear in the index. Like  Leonard Peikoff in _Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand_, Kelley has  taken off on his own -- but unlike Peikoff, he does not present his own  theories as Rand's.<br />As for those theories themselves, they are at least  interesting. Kelley is concerned to reject what he calls the  &quot;diaphanous model of perception&quot; -- basically the view that, in  order for perception to be veridical, the world &quot;out there&quot; must  really _be_ just as we perceive it. This model, he argues, lies at the root  of both &quot;representationalism&quot; and &quot;epistemological  idealism.&quot;<br />In its place he proposes what probably few would deny:  that the contents of our experience are the outcome of  physico-chemico-bio-psychological causal processes. Taking his lead from  Rand, he argues that the fact that experience is caused by such processing  does not render it indirect or unreliable. To make this fly, he introduces  the notion of a &quot;perceptual form&quot; and argues that, e.g.,  &quot;coldness&quot; is simply the &quot;form&quot; in which we become  _directly_ aware of external temperature (or variations therein).<br />Now, as  I noted above, this is clearly _not_ &quot;direct realism&quot; (which  Kelley explicitly rejects under the title of &quot;naive realism&quot; as  one side of a false dichotomy stemming from the aforementioned  &quot;diaphanous model&quot;). While maintaining that consciousness is not  &quot;metaphysically active&quot; (i.e. it does not &quot;create&quot; its  own contents), he simultaneously holds that it _is_ &quot;epistemologically  active&quot; (in &quot;processing&quot; those contents). I do not see that  this distinction can be maintained, but at any rate Kelley recognizes,  e.g., the color-experience &quot;blue&quot; as a feature of consciousness  _rather than_ as a feature of surfaces &quot;out there&quot;; the  &quot;form&quot; or mode in which we perceive various reflectance  properties is _not_ identified with the properties themselves.<br />What he is  ultimately after is a theory of perception (which he defines as &quot;the  direct awareness of discriminated entities by means of patterns of energy  absorption by sense receptors&quot;) that will allow him to treat  perception as providing &quot;a mode of nonpropositional, noninferential  justification.&quot;<br />In order to pull this off, he has to make an  extremely dubious distinction between &quot;perceptions&quot; and  &quot;perceptual judgments.&quot; He acknowledges that other philosophers  have rarely seen fit to make this distinction clearly, noting correctly  that most have held the element of judgment to be what differentiates  perception from sensation in the first place. Kelley argues, in my view  unsuccessfully, that his own theory allows him to &quot;distinguish between  the judgment and the percept and to consider the former on its own  terms.&quot;<br />Why unsuccessfully? Well, I shall not be able to answer  completely here, but I shall indicate where some of the problem lies.  Kelley makes a strange move in dealing with perception and reference: he  argues that whereas &quot;questions of justification normally concern the  predicative element of . . . judgment&quot; (when we judge that &quot;x is  P,&quot; how do we know x is P and not R?), we can raise a similar question  about the _subject_ (when we judge that &quot;x is P,&quot; how do we know  it is x and not y which is P?). This move leaves it open for him to  identify &quot;perception&quot; as the means by which we  (nonpropositionally and noninferentially) discriminate the subjects of such  judgments.<br />I do not find this even remotely plausible. The &quot;x&quot;  Kelley needs here is not a bare particular but a collection of attributes  (which seem, by the way, to be universals); &quot;how I know it is x and  not y&quot; must be justified in terms of other predicates. That is, the  &quot;subject&quot; is unnecessary here; upon analysis, it resolves itself  into a vast congeries of predicates. And Kelley's act of perceptual  discrimination comes to look a lot more like inference than he thinks it  does.<br />However, Kelley's work is well worth reading, especially as a  change of pace from Rand's. He is well versed in the relevant literature  and at least displays knowledge of opposing positions (even if, at times,  he seems to think it sufficient to describe a position and announce his  rejection of it rather than give actual arguments). In short, his  scholarship beats the heck out of Rand's.<br />Readers of this work looking  for related viewpoints might want to follow up with some D.M. Armstrong or  William Alston, with whom Kelley deals at least briefly in his text.  (Oddly, however, Armstrong is not listed in his index.) Those interested in  an opposing view will find a good case in the portions of Brand Blanshard's  _The Nature of Thought_ devoted to Blanshard's theory of perception.  Indeed, I wish Kelley had dealt with these chapters himself rather than  spending so much time dealing with post-linguistic-turn  &quot;epistemological idealism.&quot;eption from sensation in the first place.

Published in 1978, this sturdy little volume by Thomas Nagel is a defense of the claim that there is an objective moral requirement on all rational agents to behave altruistically.<br />Nagel makes clear that &quot;[b]y  altruism I mean not abject self-sacrifice but merely a willingness to act  in consideration of the interests of other persons, without the need of  ulterior motives.&quot; The primary problem to which he devotes his  attention is not what sorts of behavior we are thus committed to, but the  more fundamental one of how it is possible for such considerations to  motivate us _at all_.<br />I shall not try to summarize his arguments here;  this work was published long enough ago that critical evaluations of them  are available elsewhere (e.g. in Christine Korsgaard's _The Kingdom of  Ends_). Suffice it to say that they involve Nagel's usual tension between  the personal and impersonal points of view -- that is, between subjectivity  and objectivity -- and the attempt to find some resolution or balance  between them (a theme which runs through much of his work and indeed which  he seems to have staked out as his own philosophical territory).<br />At any  rate his conclusion is that it is entirely rational for us to be thus  motivated and that &quot;rational altruism&quot; is a genuine  possibility.<br />And perhaps most importantly of all, Nagel has stated the  _problem_ correctly. I realize this may not be a big deal to some of  Nagel's readers. But personally I find it a blessed relief, as I spend a  good deal of time reading and criticizing the works of Ayn Rand and her  followers; it is a pleasure to read an argument about altruism that gets  the issue straight and recognizes that other-regard is simply not reducible  to prudence.<br />Which it isn't, and Nagel's mostly lucid work on this topic  has the merit of making this point utterly clear. Readers of David Kelley's  _Unrugged Individualism_ and Tibor Machan's _Generosity_ should probably  attempt, at some point, to come to terms with the arguments in this volume.pt, at some point, to come to terms with the arguments in this volume.	2000-05-05

Once we recognize this category of thoughts, he  maintains, &quot;the range of examples turns out to be quite  wide.&quot;<br />He proceeds to demonstrate his point in the areas of  language, logic, science, and ethics (to each of which he devotes a  chapter).  His arguments are intended to show, essentially, that meaning,  logical necessity, the demand for order in objective reality, and  normativity are not reducible to matters of pure subjectivity, and for the  most part they are fairly successful.<br />His closing chapter --  &quot;Evolutionary Naturalism and the Fear of Religion&quot; -- is  remarkable for several reasons, not least of which is its stunning candor.  Nagel is an atheist who nevertheless recognizes that his somewhat Platonic  commitment to reason, and in particular to a Peircian belief in an  objective &quot;order of . . . logical relations among propositions,&quot;  raises the question &quot;what world picture to associate it with.&quot; He  cannot avoid the &quot;suspicion that the picture will be religious, or  quasi-religious,&quot; and notes that rationalism &quot;has always had a  more religious flavor than empiricism.&quot;<br />And -- here comes the candor  -- he attributes at least some anti-rationalism to a &quot;fear of  religion&quot; which he confesses himself to share: &quot;I want atheism to  be true and am made uneasy by the fact that some of the most intelligent  and well-informed people I know are religious believers. It isn't just that  I don't believe in God and, naturally, hope that I'm right in my belief.  It's that I hope there is no God! I don't want there to be a God; I don't  want the universe to be like that.&quot;<br />He finds, though, that he must  acknowledge the distinct possibility that &quot;the capacity of the  universe to generate organisms with minds capable of understanding the  universe is itself somehow a fundamental feature of the universe.&quot; He  adds at once that this view need not amount to &quot;anything that should  count literally as religious belief&quot; -- though, honestly, it is hard  to see why not.<br />At any rate, whatever the implications for religion,  Nagel's arguments in this volume are delivered with his usual clarity and  flair and will be of interest to anyone seeking a philosophical defense of  reason. As Nagel himself notes not far from the outset of his book, the  knowledge that subjectivism is self-refuting may be as &quot;old as the  hills,&quot; but it seems that it cannot be too often repeated.'t want there to be a God; I don't  want the universe to be like that.&quot;<br />He finds, though, that he must  acknowledge the distinct possibility that &quot;the capacity of the  universe to generate organisms with minds capable of understanding the  universe is itself somehow a fundamental feature of the universe.&quot; He  adds at once that this view need not amount to &quot;anything that should  count literally as religious belief&quot; -- though, honestly, it is hard  to see why not.<br />At any rate, whatever the implications for religion,  Nagel's arguments in this volume are delivered with his usual clarity and  flair and will be of interest to anyone seeking a philosophical defense of  reason.

The late great Murray Rothbard described Ludwig von Mises's _The Theory of Money and Credit_ as the best book on money ever written. And so it is.<br />It is probably best known as the volume which first set out the  distinctive Austrian theory of the trade cycle. For that alone, it deserves  a place on the bookshelf of everyone who cares about such things (and more  people should).<br />But there's much more to it than that. This volume sets  out a complete and groundbreaking theory of money itself: what it is, where  it comes from, what it means to speak of its &quot;value,&quot; the  differences between commodity money and fiat money, the demand for money  and what it has to do with banking, and -- crucially -- the jiggery-pokery  that becomes possible when the State starts messing around with unsound  monetary policy.<br />This edition also includes a section on &quot;Monetary  Reconstruction&quot; written in 1952 (and first included in the 1953 Yale  University Press edition).<br />Plus there's a foreword by Murray Rothbard.

This handsomely-bound expanded Liberty Fund edition of Michael Oakeshott's essays features some material not included in the earlier edition (notably, but not only, Oakeshott's introduction to Hobbes's _Leviathan_). But the  greatest treat is still the title essay.<br />In &quot;Rationalism in  Politics,&quot; Oakeshott sets out to dissect the sort of modern  &quot;rationalism&quot; that reduces reason to explicit technical knowledge  and has no place for the sort of &quot;traditional&quot; knowledge we soak  up through imitation. (Readers of F.A. Hayek will find a parallel here,  though not an exact one, with Hayek's own view of implicit knowledge and  its role in market processes.) His deft characterizations of such  &quot;rationalism&quot; will no doubt remind many readers of many leading  lights of the political left, but they also remind me -- perhaps  surprisingly -- of someone else.<br />I have a friend who insists, with much  justice, that Ayn Rand was essentially a &quot;leftist&quot; despite her  defense of views that have generally belonged to the political right. In  support of his claim, he cites a number of well-known features of Rand's  thought, including (of relevance here) her utter rejection of tradition and  religion, her deep distrust of &quot;implicit&quot; reasoning, and her  almost messianic plans to &quot;remake&quot; the world in accordance with  her own explicit conceptual scheme while riding roughshod over basic human  realities that might interfere. (For more on this general topic, see Paul  Johnson's _Intellectuals_. Though unfortunately he does not take Rand as  one of his targets, his remarks on what happens when such  &quot;intellectuals&quot; put their ideas into practice could practically  have been written about the &quot;Objectivist&quot; movement.)<br />This  thesis gains a great deal of plausibility from a reading of Oakeshott.  Rand's hideously inadequate understanding of &quot;reason&quot; is  remarkably consonant with the variety of &quot;rationalism&quot; which he  skewers here, and which she more or less enshrined in her own feeble  attempts at epistemology.<br />And as her journals and letters show, she  deliberately pitched her philosophy of &quot;Objectivism&quot; toward  left-liberals, presenting it as a non-Statist replacement for  traditionalism and conservatism while basing it on essentially the same  &quot;radical&quot; empiricist-nominalist-materialist-secularist worldview  (up to and including a remarkably similar view of &quot;reason&quot;) as  Marx and Lenin. (Readers will find further discussion of this last point in  John Robbins's imperfect but helpful _Without A Prayer: Ayn Rand and the  Close of Her System_.)<br />Now, I certainly don't mean to suggest that the  _only_ reason for reading Oakeshott is to disabuse oneself of Rand-worship!  Far from it; all of Oakeshott's immensely learned essays sparkle with  insights that will be of interest to political thinkers of all stripes. But  I do think he will be of special interest to the growing number of  conservative libertarians who wish to recover classical liberalism from the  spell of one of its most dangerously bewitching  &quot;defenders.&quot;<br />The enemies of liberty on the political left are  fairly obvious, and most classical liberals are unlikely to be taken in by  them. The greater hazard is posed by those &quot;friends&quot; who borrow  more or less classical-liberal _conclusions_ and try to place them on a  foundation which will not hold them, indeed which leads to their very  opposite if (unlike Rand) one starts from the allegedly foundational  premises and works forward.<br />I also don't mean to imply my own complete  agreement with Oakeshott. But those who wish to exorcise Rand's demonic  influence from the politics of classical liberalism will have a hard time  finding a more powerful antidote than the opening essay in this volume.iety of &quot;rationalism&quot; which he  skewers here, and which she more or less enshrined in her own feeble  attempts at epistemology.<br />And as her journals and letters show, she  deliberately pitched her philosophy of &quot;Objectivism&quot; toward  left-liberals, presenting it as a non-Statist replacement for  traditionalism and conservatism while basing it on essentially the same  &quot;radical&quot; empiricist-nominalist-materialist-secularist worldview  (up to and including a remarkably similar view of &quot;reason&quot;) as  Marx and Lenin.

If you've wondered why in the world so many anti-American, anti-family, anti-religion movies manage to earn Oscars, this book is for you.<br /><br />In it, Michael Medved takes a long hard look at the stuff produced by the movie industry and shows that there's a pattern to it all.<br /><br />It's not \\"greed\\" and  \\"profit.\\" Despite the attempts of numerous left-leaning folks to  smear capitalism and the free market, it isn't \\"corporate greed\\"  that drove the movies down into their current state. As Medved shows, lots  of studios could have done much better at the box office if they had  produced moral and uplifting films that respected (not  \\"promoted,\\" just \\"respected\\") the values held by the  vast majority of Americans.<br /><br />No, the movie industry is just out of touch  with its market. And why? The culprit isn't \\"greed\\" but a false  idealism.<br /><br />What Medved shows in effect is that the moviemakers are playing  to the chorus -- looking for accolades from their peers based on their  alleged \\"artistic achievement.\\" And that achievement is based on  a view of \\"art\\" that most of us probably wouldn't find  congenial.<br /><br />Medved shows that there is an overarching pattern in what's  been coming out of Hollywood for the last three of four decades. Its  destructive \\"art\\" (with some exceptions that should have taught  the industry something about its customers) tends deliberately to take  traditional religion and morality as its intentional target, and regards  the trashing of those values as a \\"success.\\"<br /><br />Disagree? Then let  Medved convince you. Watch him summarize, e.g., Hollywood's recent  portrayals of clergy and other religiously devoted people, and then ask  yourself what would have happened if the movie industry had similarly  targeted, say, gays and lesbians. If you give the obvious answer, then  you'll know there's a powerful bias at work in the  \\"entertainment\\" world.	2000-05-03

As exemplars of her philosophy (including her \\"new\\" version of \\"egoism\\" as  set forth in this volume), Rand repeatedly held up herself, her husband,  and Nathaniel and Barbara Branden; if she regarded the four of them as  living examples of Objectivist practice, it is entirely licit to use her  personal life as a basis for criticism. (And recall that she made these  remarks at a time when she was engaged in an extramarital affair with  Nathaniel, justifying/rationalizing her adultery as a form of behavior  suitable only for moral \\"giants\\" like her.)    Moreover, on  Rand's argument that \\"the moral is the practical,\\" the practical  behavior of Objectivists in general is fair game, which is why I also  highly recommend reading Ellen Plasil's _Therapist_ (and, of course, the  Brandens' two biographies). At any rate, such stuff is enlightening as  regards how well (or badly) the principles of Objectivism succeed in  actually _achieving_ the stated goals of the Objectivist  philosophy.    \\"At the base of her work is the unshakable foundation of  her Objectivist Epistemology, that proves the human mind as capable of  producing valid knowledge.\\"    Nonsense. I've personally driven several  trucks through the holes in ITOE, and I'll be happy to send my utterly  destructive critiques to anyone who wants them. The Objectivist  epistemology is ultimately a version of nominalism, in which there is  nothing new except the errors Rand herself introduced. She just failed to  notice because she gave a tendentious misrepresentation of nominalism. But  her epistemology inherits all of nominalism's problems, including its  inability to justify \\"knowledge.\\" (Plus a host of additional  problems introduced by Rand's own silly arguments, e.g. her confusion of  sensation and perception, her contention that knowledge isn't  propositional, her strange claim that a concept doesn't change once it's  formed, and her botched attempt to use the label \\"contextually  absolute knowledge\\" as a fig leaf for error.)    \\"After  establishing the definitive criteria to validate knowledge, Ayn Rand, never  deviating from it, gives you valid arguments in favor of your right to live  your life with the pursuit of your values and happiness as your  responsibility and right.\\"    More nonsense. Rand's work on  epistemology came _last_ (and even _she_ regarded it as unfinished). In  fact, as demonstrated by the early writings the Ayn Rand Institute has  helpfully made available, her more-or-less-Nietzschean ethics were where  she _started_ -- even before she she adopted the free-market economics of  Ludwig von Mises. (By the way, did you know that she voted for FDR?)    Her  epistemology, such as it is, was supposed to provide a foundation for  certain ethical conclusions at which she had already arrived on other  grounds -- and it demonstrably fails to do so. For example, her  identification of \\"human\\" with one attribute of human beings  (rationality), and her consequent dismissal of irrational people as  subhuman, directly violates her dictum in ITOE that a concept  \\"means\\" all of its referents, together with _all_ their  attributes.    Here again, anybody who reads critically can drive several trucks through her extremely poor arguments. Depending on which proof-texts you pick, Rand's arguments for \\"rights\\" either (a) reduce the \\"obligation\\" to respect them entirely to considerations of one's own self-interest, or (b) aren't consistent with  the rest of her philosophy. Either way, she hasn't provided any foundation  for them at all.    Generally, her work in ethics depends on the same  \\"false trichotomy\\" -- intrinsicism vs. subjectivism vs. the  alleged \\"third way\\" of Objectivism -- that she eventually  introduced into her epistemology. And her subjectivistic nominalism doesn't  work any betterin her theory of value than it does in her theory of  knowledge.    That's enough for one review. Wanna hear more? Drop me a note.	2000-05-02

Scott Peck's _People of the Lie_ makes an interesting case that \\"evil\\" should be recognized as a scientific and psychotherapeutic category.<br /><br />Peck warns that his book is \\"dangerous,\\" I think in part because it could lead casual readers to run around branding others as \\"evil\\" without clinical evidence. However, dangerous or not, his book presents some fine portraits of what do seem to be some genuinely evil patients.<br /><br />I'm not terribly impressed with his section on \\"exorcism\\" for various reasons, but the only reason I'll mention here is that I'm not sure what it's doing in this book. Peck leads into it with a chapter on \\"Charlene,\\" a former patient of his whom he was ultimately unable to help; he concludes this chapter by remarking that if he'd known then what he knows now, he might have been able to offer her \\"salvation\\" in the form of \\"deliverance and exorcism.\\"  Yet within another dozen pages or so, he's remarking that exorcism probably *wouldn't* have helped her and that victims of \\"possession\\" aren't necessarily evil to any great degree themselves. Okay, but then why discuss the topic in this book?<br /><br />I'll refrain from comment on some of Peck's other conclusions and merely remark that I think the book weakens toward the end. However, for all that, it's still a fine volume on a very real phenomenon: the evil human being, understood (my paraphrase) as one who goes about deliberately inhibiting or undermining the spiritual growth and well-being of other people.<br /><br />Of course therapists can be \\"evil\\" in that sense too, and Ellen Plasil's book _Therapist_ -- which gives a fascinating and horrifying account of psychotherapist Lonnie Leonard -- makes an interesting companion to this book.	2000-05-01

But unfortunately for Rand and her seemingly deathless (and hydra-headed) Admiration Society, there is more to doing sound philosophy (including  political and economic theory) than writing a big long novel and then  peppering a series of sloppily-reasoned short essays with quotations from  it.<br /><br />The basic problem, of course, is that a novel is _fiction_. The fact that Rand can write a story in which something or other happens is evidence  only of the vividness of her imagination, no matter how plausible she makes it sound in the artificial world of her novel. And in this case, the fiction in question is not without deep problems of its own.<br /><br />Other reviewers, including me, have called attention to the fact that Rand  basically puts most of the world to death in this grandiose fantasy of  hers, ultimately on the \\"argument\\" that some human beings aren't _really_ human after all. And other reviewers, including me, have called  attention to the fact that outside of \\"Galt's Gulch,\\" capitalism  is _not_ dependent solely on the mighty creative efforts of a handful of  geniuses but primarily on a vast network of cooperating human beings, pretty much any two or three of whom working together could out-survive a lone John Galt who is wholly dependent on his own resources.<br /><br />The free  market _does_ (sometimes) reward (some types of) genius, of course, but primarily it rewards the willingness to engage in peaceful commerce even with relative strangers and the ability to provide those strangers with stuff they want in exchange for stuff they're willing to part with. A supergenius who was, like Howard Roark, \\"born without the ability to  consider other people\\" would find himself either undergoing a serious attitude adjustment or else starving to death while he tried to find \\"other people\\" willing to let him exercise his sublime and  incomparable genius on _their_ construction projects. (And we might well wonder how someone described in such clearly narcissistic terms could design buildings suitable for human habitation at all, let alone as wonderfully adapted to their occupants' needs as Rand says Roark's  buildings are.)<br /><br />And just for fun, I'll add that a real-life Dagny Taggart would be damned lucky if she didn't get pregnant several times during the course of her bedroom escapades with metallurgist/adulterer Hank Rearden  while she lived out Rand's ideal of \\"romantic love.\\" (I hope Rand herself was so lucky. But in light of her ill-reasoned views on abortion, one has to wonder.) She'd be even luckier if a man who was willing to cheat on his wife was also willing to support any children he happened to father in the process. (But on Rand Planet, it's Dagny who tosses Hank over for  John Galt. And guess what: Hank doesn't mind. Don't try this at home.)<br /><br />At any rate, Rand's tendentious fiction is hardly within tomato-tossing distance of the real free market or its genuinely philosophical defenses. Rand's bizarre and ultimately subjectivist ethic doesn't even permit us to say that, ceteris paribus, it would be _good_ if everyone had sufficient food, housing, medical care, and so forth; that, on her terms, would be  \\"intrinsicism.\\"<br /><br />The fact that capitalism accomplishes these aims  in as economically efficient a manner as will ever be possible on earth, and that it does so without violating the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness of the people who do the accomplishing, is not a fact one will learn from Rand. Oh, she mentions it once in a while, but she can't present any sound arguments for it -- and, really, she doesn't even think it's all that important.<br /><br />She acknowledges that there are ultimately no actual _conflicts_ of interest among \\"rational\\" people, but that our interests are, or can be, positively _coherent_ seems to have  escaped her altogether. This latter is one of those facts that falls by the wayside owing to her impoverished view of \\"reason\\" -- which, on her kindergarten-level understanding, is satisfied by merely \\"noncontradictory identification.\\" (Strictly construed, this view  should have committed her to some form of logical atomism. Be that is it  may, no intelligence worthy of the name is satisfied by the sheer absence of contradiction.)<br /><br />For the arguments that Rand couldn't be bothered to  offer, one has to go to a _real_ economist like Ludwig von Mises -- who,  despite his high volume of scholarly output, didn't write even one single  novel during his entire career.

She tries, of course, but as I've pointed out in numerous  reviews apparently skipped by our friend below, she was not at all  successful.    She's also not entirely honest. Here's an example cited by our  friend, in which we can see history being rewritten: \\"A definiton of  selfishness as 'excessive concern with self' violates (c), until such time  as 'excessive' is given an exact meaning. . . . Hence Rand substitutes the  definition that corresponds to the actual significance of the word in  reality - concern with one's own desires.\\"    That's not what Rand  herself thought she was doing. In fact she writes (p. vii of _The Virtue of  Selfishness_) that her definition of \\"selfishness\\" _is_ the  \\"dictionary definition.\\" Perhaps she was still using the  dictionary that allegedly misled her into using the word  \\"egotist\\" (rather than \\"egoist\\") throughout _The  Fountainhead_ -- the one nobody's ever been able to find again.    Maybe the  dictionary was published by the same folks who published the collection of  quotations from which she culled her famous misstatement of Ralph Waldo  Emerson in the present volume: \\"Consistency is the hobgoblin of little  minds.\\" In fact Emerson wrote, \\"A _foolish_ consistency\\" --  and, as a glance through the relevant passage of \\"Self-reliance\\"  will show, his meaning was almost diametrically opposite to that which Rand  attributed to him. (I have a short essay on this point that I'll gladly  forward to anyone who asks.)    Was Rand misled here too? Or did she just lie?  In fact I've mentioned in at least two other reviews that an acquaintance  of mine pointed out this misrepresentation before the relevant issue of the  Ayn Rand Letter was published, and Rand refused to change it. (Maybe our  critic didn't actually read all the other reviews before popping off about  how nobody was giving examples of her misrepresentations of other thinkers.  In any case, these review pages aren't designed for _detailed_ discussions;  I'll be happy to discuss this stuff at length with anybody who writes to  me.)     And what New Testament do you suppose she was using when she  misquoted, \\"Money is the root of all evil\\"? Even a non-Christian  like me knows that 1 Timothy 6:10 refers to the _love_ of money and means  something quite other than what Rand took it to mean. And by the way, our  critic to the contrary notwithstanding, I have no objections to \\"words  with moral connotations.\\"    _Whatever_ her contributions to philosophy  may or may not have been, Rand herself was hardly a moral paragon -- a point easily supported by simply reading either of the  biographies that have been written by her former associates. Further and  stronger support is available in Ellen Plasil's book _Therapist_, and  there's (some) useful information in Jeff Walker's _The Ayn Rand Cult_ too.    And since Rand held herself up as an exemplar of her philosophy, such  information is entirely pertinent. Rand claimed, to the end of her life, to  have done it all without help from anyone and to have never changed her  mind about anything of fundamental importance. Both of these claims are barefaced falsehoods, but I have little doubt that she rationalized them as  well as she rationalized her extramarital affair with Nathaniel Branden.	2000-04-15

I found Hugh Ross's discussion helpful and enlightening, but I was forced to conclude that Gerald Schroeder's _God and the Big Bang_ is a far superior book.<br /><br />In the first place, Ross tends to rush a bit through his  positive presentations, be somewhat unclear on details, and hurry on to  point out the errors in the assumptions of his opponents. (This last, to my  mind, he spends an inordinate amount of time doing, and not very well at  that. Though he devotes a great deal of space to it overall, he gives very  little attention to any one thinker.)<br /><br />In the second place, and far more  seriously given his aim in this book, he very often writes as though the  evidence he is presenting tells exclusively in favor of Christianity. It  does not; his Creator God, and the relevant chapters of Genesis, are hardly  the exclusive property of the Christian religion, and at any rate his  cosmological argument proves not one single thing about Jesus. Very nearly  every argument in this volume is in fact _also_ an argument for the God of  Judaism -- a point lost on Ross because he regards Judaism as in some way  \\"deny[ing] portions of God's transcendence\\" [p. 79].<br /><br />(Yes, that's  what he says -- in what, as far as I can tell, is his _sole_ comment on  Judaism in this entire volume. Since he gives no reason for this remark  beyond the fact that Judaism \\"rejects the New Testament,\\" I have  no way to tell precisely _what_ part of Judaism he has misunderstood. By  the way, his remark also refers  to Islam, Mormonism, and one or two other  religions whose adherents will no doubt be surprised to learn that they  \\"deny portions of God's transcendence.\\")<br /><br />Now, I certainly don't  think that a Christian author needs to go out of his way to argue for  Judaism! But my criticism is still entirely relevant, since according to  Ross himself, he typically winds up his cosmology lectures by asking people  whether they're ready to accept Christ -- apparently on the grounds that he  has somehow proven the truth of Christianity by making a good case for the  existence of the God of Genesis.<br /><br />So I think it is entirely pertinent and  just to point out that, in fact, he has proven no such thing. In fact just  about the only thing in this volume with which a Jew would be bound to  disagree is Ross's apparent belief that his science supports _only_  Christianity. What it supports is belief in the God of the Bible. Whether  the New Testament merits inclusion in that Bible is an entirely separate  question, beyond the scope both of Ross's book and of my review thereof.<br /><br />At  any rate, this is a fairly good book. I would just recommend supplementing  it with something else -- something both more informative and less  unjustifiably sectarian.<br /><br />(And note that a book presenting actual arguments  in favor specifically of Christianity would count as _justifiably_  sectarian!

When Torah and natural science seem to conflict, one or the other is being incorrectly interpreted. That's the principle Gerald Schroeder propounds and defends in this remarkable volume. And I can only think that Moses  Maimonides would have been delighted.<br />What Schroeder argues, basically,  is that the biblical account of creation in six days can be read as taking  place over six _literal_ days -- and that not only does this reading fail  to conflict with modern science, indeed science itself supports that  reading. The solution? The six days are &quot;God's time,&quot; reckoned  from within one frame of reference, and the millions of years with which  science deals are &quot;earth time,&quot; reckoned from within another. The  two are reconciled by the theory of relativity. Moreover, this reading is  firmly grounded in traditional Jewish texts that predated the theory of  relativity by one or two thousand years.<br />I'll let Schroeder fill you in  on the details. But whether those details are sound or not, his _approach_  is refreshingly sane.<br />On the one hand, we have various sorts of  Bible-thumper insisting that all our knowledge must come from the Word of  God and nothing else -- an insistence that turns easily into  anti-intellectual ranting against science. On the other, we have various  sorts of scientistic yahoo insisting that religion is bunk and science is  the royal road to truth.<br />Rubbish, on both counts. The Torah does indeed  bear signs that it is a Divine communication, and people who believe this  are being entirely reasonable. (See, e.g., Lawrence Kelemen's _Permission  To Receive_ for a defense of this view.) However, the Bible itself insists  that human beings are made in the Divine image, that rationality is that  very image, and that the &quot;natural&quot; universe provides abundant  evidence of the workings of the Divine. And it is _this_ view, in one form  or another, which -- as a matter of history and logic -- gave rise to  modern science in the first place; without the &quot;substrate&quot; of  rationalism implied by the view that the entire universe is the creation of  a single rational Mind, &quot;empirical&quot; science can't even get  started. There's no need to decide between the Bible and science; they  can't really be separated anyway.<br />So it may be that some of Schroeder's  details require revision (and I understand that some of them are in fact  revised in his next book, _The Science of God_). Nevertheless the lesson to  learn from this book is still sound: that whenever science and Torah seem  to be at odds with one another, the proper procedure is to suspend final  judgment, think, and wait. Further information may provide unexpected  resolutions.<br />(And by the way, the review below picks on Schroeder for an  absolutely ridiculous &quot;error.&quot; The big, round figures used in  those calculations aren't anywhere near precise enough to locate us in the  &quot;middle of the fifth day&quot; as opposed to the sixth, and Schroeder  doesn't say they are.)modern science in the first place; without the &quot;substrate&quot; of  rationalism implied by the view that the entire universe is the creation of  a single rational Mind, &quot;empirical&quot; science can't even get  started.

Further information may provide unexpected  resolutions.<br />(And by the way, the review below picks on Schroeder for an  absolutely ridiculous &quot;error.&quot; The big, round figures used in  those calculations aren't anywhere near precise enough to locate us in the  &quot;middle of the fifth day&quot; as opposed to the sixth, and Schroeder  doesn't say they are.)	2000-04-10

In this fairly short and tightly reasoned book (unfortunately not now in print), Isaac Kikawada and Arthur Quinn argue very convincingly that the \\"documentary hypothesis\\" has had its day.<br /><br />Their thesis: that a  hundred-odd years of scholarship inspired by Wellhausen's theory has  _itself_ produced the very evidence which proves it false. In order to  support this contention, the authors examine the portion of the Bible at  which support for the \\"documentary hypothesis\\" seems strongest:  the story of Noah and the Flood. And true to their aim, they deftly show  that the very features of the text which seem to support multiple  authorship can, when viewed slightly differently, also be seen as evidence  that the text is the work of a single author capable of great brilliance  and subtlety.<br /><br />It is this last point that I think deserves the greatest  emphasis. Too often, the stories of the Jewish scriptures are written off  as \\"primitive\\" or \\"barbaric,\\" and superficial  contradictions or immoralities are taken as evidence of the  unsophistication of the text's author(s) and target audience. Recognizing  and questioning our hidden assumption here is an essential step toward  recognizing the possibility that -- as Kikawada and Quinn put it -- if we  think we spot an error in the text, it is more likely we who are at fault.<br /><br />For consider: since the \\"documentary hypothesis\\" requires a  \\"redactor\\" who was not unduly concerned about obvious  \\"contradictions,\\" why do we rule out the possibility that a  _single_ author might have been similarly unconcerned? And if the latter  possibility is _not_ ruled out, why do we assume that these apparent  \\"contradictions\\" are not stylistic contrivances that are intended  for a more sophisticated audience than we have thus far considered?<br /><br />And in  that case, might not the very features of the text revealed by proponents  of the \\"documentary hypothesis\\" be themselves evidence of a  deeper unity and design? Why, rather than look for such unity and design,  do we assume the \\"redactor\\" must have been so stupid as to be  unable to recognize difficulties that are obvious to any child (and indeed  were discussed in the Talmudic literature at least two millennia ago)?<br /><br />Kikawada and Quinn have laid waste to the \\"documentary  hypothesis\\" by accepting what is good in it and showing that it  undermines itself. This little book will be of interest to all who wish to  defend the integrity of Scripture, and especially to readers of Umberto  Cassuto's _The Documentary Hypothesis_ (unfortunately not now in print  either).h unity and design,  do we assume the \\"redactor\\" must have been so stupid as to be  unable to recognize difficulties that are obvious to any child (and indeed  were discussed in the Talmudic literature at least two millennia ago)?

Tara Smith here tries to make the best possible case for the Objectivist theory of \\"value.\\" She does a fairly good job, and she is surely right to make \\"life\\" in _some_ way the standard of value for  ethical purposes. But I do not see that she has improved on Rand in her formulation of this point.<br /><br />As another reviewer notes, Smith's answer to the question \\"Why be moral?\\" is, \\"You should be moral because you have chosen to live.\\" And this is indeed Rand's answer.<br /><br />But it is not without troubles of its own. Suppose I have chosen to die; is it really  true that \\"anything goes\\"? Is my decision to take a few hundred  children with me really just \\"amoral,\\" or is it positively _immoral_? If the latter, then my own reasons for being moral are not  exhausted in my own choice \\"to live.\\"<br /><br />In short, neither Rand nor Smith (nor any other Objectivist) has yet managed to mount a case for  ethics that really includes what most of us mean by \\"rights.\\" Your rights, if they have any moral existence or meaning at all, must provide me with reasons for refraining from treating you in certain ways  independently of my alleged decision \\"to live.\\"<br /><br />Of course, Objectivism would say my decision to die is \\"immoral\\" too. But (a) this is inconsistent with Objectivism's basic view of morality as presented by both Rand and Smith; on that view, in strict logic, the decision to die can be immoral-for-me only if I have _already_, contra  hypothesis, decided to live. And (b) it still doesn't meet the objection I mentioned above, that the moral constraints imposed by your  \\"rights\\" still apply to me _even_ if I'm irrevocably suicidal.<br /><br />The entire Objectivist approach to ethics needs to be re-thought from scratch. I'm afraid Smith hasn't yet accomplished that task.	2000-04-08

I see from some of the reviews on this page that not all of George H. Smith's defenders have taken to heart his advice in _Atheism, Ayn Rand, and Other Heresies_ that there _is_ such a thing as a \\"rational  theist\\" and that the presumption of rationality should guide exchanges  between theists and atheists. I happen to agree with Smith on this point  and happily acknowledge that there is also such a thing as a \\"rational  atheist.\\"<br /><br />In that spirit, since I am myself a \\"rational  theist,\\" I shall point out some difficulties in Smith's approach in  this volume -- which is, I must say, probably the best defense of atheism  currently extant.<br /><br />There is, first of all, Smith's acceptance of the laws of  logic (identity, contradiction, and causality). His characterization of  these is quite apt and his discussion of them is on the whole very good;  they are indeed axiomatic and strictly indubitable.<br /><br />What he does not  discuss, just as Ayn Rand did not discuss it, is that sheer disbelief in  contradictions is quite insufficient as a foundation of _reason_. What  reason seeks is something more than mere noncontradiction; it seeks  positive coherence, which is a much stronger condition. And as Brand  Blanshard has argued in e.g. _The Nature of Thought_ and _Reason and  Analysis_, _all_ thought proceeds on the postulate that the universe is  intelligible in this stronger sense. In this sense, the postulate of  intelligibility is also the absolute presupposition of some sort of idealism, though we cannot pause here to spell out just why.<br /><br />Now, the very  possibility of explanation, that is, the positive intelligibility of the  world, even in a weaker sense than full coherence, entails a much closer  relationship between mind and reality than is admitted in (what seems to  be) Smith's view of the world. If his materialism denies such a  relationship, then it denies also the reliability of rational explanation  (as opposed to Rand's merely \\"noncontradictory identification,\\" a  kindergarten-level understanding of \\"reason\\" that, strictly  construed, commits her to some form of logical atomism). On the other hand,  if his \\"materialism\\" is really the sort of Searleian  \\"physicalism\\" that regards mind as a high-level property of  matter, then it is implicitly a form of idealism anyway, and theism lies  just around the corner.<br /><br />(For if mind emerges \\"automatically\\" from  certain arrangements of mass/energy, then _any_ bit of matter is at least  potentially part of mind -- and mind was \\"there\\" to begin with,  not merely a property that \\"emerges\\" later. I could, for example,  exchange any electron in my brain for any other, could I not?)<br /><br />Does that  get us all the way to theism? No, but I won't pursue the remainder of the  argument here. Suffice it to say that, in insisting that the theist  \\"define\\" God, the definition Smith overlooks is the very one that  many religious people would defend: that God is the \\"Absolute  Mind\\" in the thought of which our universe is the object -- in Whom,  that is, we \\"live and move and have our being.\\"<br /><br />But while  ostensibly taking Christianity as his foil, Smith attacks views of God that  really come from Aristotle (sometimes by way of Aquinas). The relation of  these views to the theology of his target is questionable, to say the  least. While I am not myself a Christian, I am at least aware that many  theologically informed Protestants would reject the implicitly  medieval-Roman-Catholic view of God on which Smith's argumentative fire is  mainly concentrated.<br /><br />One last point will have to suffice. On pp. 76-87  Smith discusses the problem of evil under the heading \\"God and  Goodness.\\" But he implicitly takes as his foil a view of \\"God and  Goodness\\" that Christianity would not defend in the first place.<br /><br />Again, though not a Christian myself, I am well aware of the New Testament  teaching on this point. Paul does not contend that every single event which  occurs in the universe is good for every single sentient being involved. On  the contrary, he contends that \\"all things work together  [instrumentally] for the [ultimate] good [not of everyone, but] of those  who love God.\\" That nothing in any way harmful should ever befall  anyone at all is a view of God's \\"goodness\\" which is quite alien  to the New Testament; even Jesus himself says only that those who  \\"seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness\\" will find  that \\"all these things [i.e. material well-being] will be added\\"  as well.<br /><br />Indeed, the Christian view is that the purpose of the universe  itself is, not the well-being of man, but the glory of God. But if Smith  has come to grips with this view in his discussion of the problem of evil,  I have failed to locate his remarks on it.<br /><br />He is, however, quite good in  his attacks on certain feeble, sophomoric, and irrationalist versions of  theism. What he seems not to realize is that many theists would happily  join him in these attacks.sentient being involved.

The crucial question facing any theory of political\\"rights\\" is: why should _I_ respect _yours_? And despite a tremendous effort, I'm afraid Tara Smith hasn't yet answered this question.<br /><br />I'm happy to see her declare that the deontology-vs.-consequentialism dichotomy is a false one, and I even agree with her that the right approach is \\"teleological\\" (though for somewhat different reasons from hers).  But unfortunately her own \\"teleological\\" approach fails to tell us just why one person is _morally_ obliged not to violate the rights of another.<br /><br />Her essential claim is that rights violations are _never_ in accordance with the \\"telos\\" of rights, which has to do with the securing and promotion of life. But there are two objections which Smith never adequately addresses:<br /><br />(1) The transition from \\"my rights promote my telos\\" to \\"_respecting_ my rights promotes _your_ telos\\" is never made clear, either by Rand or by Smith; each passes without acknowledgement from one claim to the other.<br /><br />(2) And by \\"respecting my rights\\" I mean respecting them _as_ rights. I'm not persuaded that Smith has given an adequate foundation for rights _as_ rights.<br /><br />For her foundation, ultimately, is that my respect for _your_ rights promotes my _own_ life. But are your rights not morally binding against me even if I have decided to kill myself? (Even if I am in the very _act_ of killing myself? If I'm driving at ninety miles an hour toward a bridge abutment, am I not in some way obliged to avoid mowing down the little girl who wanders out in front of my car?) If so, then my obligation to respect your rights is founded, at least in part, on something other than my own \\"choice to live.\\"<br /><br />Smith, like Rand before her, is at least in the ballpark. But I continue to think that the \\"Objectivist ethic\\" needs to be re-thought from the ground up -- a task that Smith has not yet performed.	2000-04-07

In this volume, Gordon Haddon Clark (not &quot;Maddon&quot;; that's a typo on Amazon's part) provides a thorough survey of the history of philosophy. His overarching concern is to argue that secular philosophy cannot provide  knowledge of truth and that -- as he suggests on his closing page -- it  might be necessary to consider seriously the possibility of divine  revelation as the sole alternative to total skepticism. This volume, while  suitable as an introduction to philosophical thought, thereby also segues  nicely into Clark's own philosophical theology of &quot;Scriptural  presuppositionalism.&quot;<br />Now, that philosophy is not without its flaws.  In the first place, Clark does not, to my knowledge, ever consider the  possibility that &quot;Scripture&quot; might consist of anything other than  the Christian Bible; why the Jewish scriptures are inadequate by themselves  is not addressed. (If it is argued that the &quot;Old Testament&quot;  contains clear pointers to the &quot;New,&quot; I shall argue in reply that  it contains much clearer pointers to the Oral Law and the Talmud. For  example, the written text clearly assumes that its readers have knowledge  of various practices --  e.g. the wearing of tefillin, the ritually-correct  method of slaughtering animals -- that are not discussed in the text  itself. For another, an oral tradition of some kind would have been  necessary just to guide the pronunciation of Hebrew words that would have  been ambiguous without vowel points. Nothing so clear as this is offered by  the standard Christian readings of &quot;Old Testament&quot; prophecies,  which uniformly depend on wrenching passages out of context.)<br />In the  second place, Clark's eminently defensible view that God is rational and  logical would, on the face of it, seem also to provide a foundation for  criticizing the text of Scripture itself. (If the Bible teaches that God is  logical, and the Bible is then found to contain contradictions, do we not  have a _reductio ad absurdum_ argument against Scriptural inerrancy?) In  fact Clark takes it to be a foundation for criticism of _misunderstandings_  of God's axiomatically-inerrant Word, and at a broad, general level this  approach is surely defensible. But why this tack cannot be likewise taken  by defenders of the Torah (or the Koran) is never made sufficiently  clear.<br />However, these issues actually tell in favor of the usefulness of  the present volume. Though Clark himself would surely not have condoned its  use in the defense of faiths other than Calvinist Christianity, many of his  critiques of opposing philosophies and even some of his defenses of  &quot;presuppositionalism&quot; could be profitably adopted by, e.g.,  Jewish theologians. His reading of philosophical history should therefore  be of interest more generally than just to Calvinists.<br />And at any rate,  it is all too seldom that a really great philosophical-theological mind  tackles the entire history of philosophy in the first place. Clark  certainly deserves respectful attention in this regard by  rationalistically-inclined religious believers everywhere, whether their  primary philosophical-theological loyalties are to Moses Maimonides or to  John Calvin.have a _reductio ad absurdum_ argument against Scriptural inerrancy?)

Michael Yang used to be an Objectivist, and now he's a Christian. And he'd like to tell you why.<br /><br />This book makes a nice companion to John Robbins's _Without A Prayer_. Yang devotes much less detailed attention to Rand's  philosophical errors and contradictions than does Robbins, on whose  previous book Yang quite properly leans. But Yang complements Robbins's  work by providing greater detail on just exactly how Rand misunderstood  and/or misrepresented Christianity. Indeed, as he notes, it was a couple of  her ill-considered remarks about the Bible that started him thinking to  begin with.<br /><br />In addition to providing fine summaries of Rand's two major  novels and an outline of her philosophy, Yang also engages a few thinkers  whom Robbins does not -- on both sides, from C.S. Lewis to George H. Smith  (author of _Atheism: The Case Against God_). Moreover, he elaborates at  some length on several broad principles at which Robbins only hints in his  own book, including (for example) the Christian theistic idealism which  both Yang and Robbins have inherited from Gordon Haddon Clark.<br /><br />Yang's book  is divided into two broad sections. In \\"Part One: The Fiction and the  Practice,\\" Yang provides the aforementioned summaries of _The  Fountainhead_ and ATLAS SHRUGGED and then spends several chapters  describing the Objectivist views of self-esteem, competence, and romantic  love. In \\"Part Two: The Philosophy,\\" he provides the  aforementioned outline of Objectivism and proceeds to criticize the  Objectivist views of reason, morality, government, and science -- in each  case arguing that Christian philosophy deals much more adequately with the  material in question than does Objectivism.<br /><br />He closes with a brief overview  of the major arguments for the existence of God (most of which, as a  Clarkian presuppositionalist, he takes to be inconclusive, though the  ontological argument fares well at his hands). An epilogue invites  Objectivists (and of course anyone else) to consider becoming Christians  themselves.<br /><br />As with Robbins's book, Objectivists will probably be put off  by Yang's solidly religious approach, assuming as they will that Rand was  right in tagging all religion as \\"irrational.\\" And again, the  loss will be theirs; Yang, like Robbins, depends heavily on Gordon Clark,  whose Reformed/Calvinist theology gave _very_ high place to reason and  rationality. (Incidentally, Clark's text on the history of philosophy,  entitled _Thales To Dewey_, was published in the same year as ATLAS  SHRUGGED.)<br /><br />At any rate, this book is a fine critique of Objectivism and an  excellent corrective to her numerous misstatements about Christianity.

We might guess from Herzog's subtitle that his reading of Jesus is going to be indebted to Paulo Freire, the Marxist who wrote _The Pedagogy of the Oppressed_. And sure enough, in the opening chapter we are treated to a  very forced and altogether unenlightening comparison of Jesus's  \\"pedagogy\\" in Galilee and Freire's in Brazil. (Indeed, Herzog  spends less time explaining the similarities than he does telling us why  the differences don't really matter.)<br /><br />Herzog sticks pretty close to Freire  throughout this work, and it shows. His language is Academic Marxspeak  nearly to the point of unintelligibility: we have lots of stuff about  codifications, elites, exploitation, oppression, social scripts, class  structure, and plenty else.<br /><br />What we wind up with, more or less, is what  Herzog imported from Freire to begin with: an understanding[?] of  \\"Jesus the parabler\\" as a \\"pedagogue of the oppressed,\\"  engaged in such activities as decoding, problematizing, and recodifying,  all for the purpose of \\"generating conversations that enhanced [his]  hearers' ability to decode their oppressive reality\\" and  \\"challenge the boundaries of their closed world\\" with what Herzog  calls \\"limit acts.\\"<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, Herzog leans heavily on  Richard Horsley's _Jesus and the Spiral of Violence_ (another  academic-Marxist reading of Jesus), and the back cover of his book features  endorsements from both Walter Wink and Robert McAfee Brown (of  \\"liberation theology\\" fame). And nobody else.<br /><br />What any of this  has to do with the historical Jesus is more than I, at least, can fathom.  Marx's \\"class-struggle\\" sociological analysis belongs in the  dustbin of history, and today largely provides window dressing for  self-impressed academics writing mostly for one another. If Jesus _were_ a  Marxist liberation theologian, he'd have been wrong anyway; the opposite of  \\"imperialism\\" ain't \\"Marxism.\\"<br /><br />But I frankly doubt that  he was any such thing. Herzog's readings of Jesus's parables are forced and  artificial, invariably based on the sort of deconstruction beloved of  text-based academics but having little to do with the actual practice of  the publicly-spoken parable; nor, really, does Herzog manage to make his  puppet-Jesus say or do anything specific enough to count as a program of  \\"liberation.\\" Mostly he seems to go around getting people to  adopt Freire's view that reality isn't fixed, apparently much to the  consternation of the powerful elite, who want the oppressed peasants to  think it _is_.<br /><br />I don't think so, Tim. While I'm not a Christian myself, I  do think Christianity deserves better than this. And anybody who knows  _anything_ about Christian theology is going to find almost nothing  recognizable in Herzog's Marxist Messiah.<br /><br />Back to the drawing board.are forced and  artificial, invariably based on the sort of deconstruction beloved of  text-based academics but having little to do with the actual practice of  the publicly-spoken parable; nor, really, does Herzog manage to make his  puppet-Jesus say or do anything specific enough to count as a program of  \\"liberation.\\" Mostly he seems to go around getting people to  adopt Freire's view that reality isn't fixed, apparently much to the  consternation of the powerful elite, who want the oppressed peasants to  think it _is_.

(He should also be better known than he is as a powerful critic of  Ayn Rand's \\"Objectivism.\\")<br /><br />As a sola-scriptura Calvinist, Robbins  offers his defenses on purely biblical grounds -- so his work should be of  tremendous interest to Christians who accept the authority of the Bible.  And since he is also concerned to present the authentic teaching of  biblical Christianity, this volume should be of general interest to  _anyone_ who wants to know what Christianity really says about political  and economic liberty.<br /><br />Robbins's attack on the Roman Church's official views  will no doubt cause consternation to a handful of American Catholic  thinkers who have recently held that Romanism is _not_ anticapitalist;  indeed, among Robbins's targets are Fr. Robert Sirico and Michael Novak.<br /><br />However, Robbins presents a great deal of documentation for his view (up to  and including the latest papal encyclicals at the time of his writing). It  is hard to know how his critics will reply, but I shall be watching with  interest.<br /><br />Readers who wish to \\"eye before they buy\\" will find an  excerpt from the book on the website of the Trinity Foundation; see the  April 2000 review, entitled \\"Intellectual Dishonesty and Roman  Catholic Apologetics.\\" Fr. Sirico's Acton Institute is probably the  place to go for a contrary opinion.	2000-03-26

So many different threads of Enlightenment thought seem to pass through the writings of Baruch Spinoza, it is perhaps surprising that so few thinkers have given full place to his work in the founding of the modern  world. In this volume Steven B. Smith seeks to repair this omission to some  extent.<br /><br />Smith is primarily concerned with Spinoza as a founder or architect  of the modern liberal polity, but with an ingenious twist: part of this  concern is _also_ with what Spinoza had to say on the related question of  \\"Jewish identity.\\" The underlying question here is: is it  possible to be a Jew, indeed for there to _be_ Judaism, in the context of a  liberal social order?<br /><br />I shall not try to summarize Smith's discussion of  Spinoza on this important question; suffice it to say that we are treated  to enlightening presentations of Spinoza's theology and his  \\"secularization\\" of the meaning of Judaism and of the Jewish  people, all of it depending on a clear and close reading of the neglected  _Theologico-Political Treatise_. For its exposition of Spinoza's thought  alone, this volume will be a helpful addition to the library of any student  of Spinoza.<br /><br />However, Smith also deals directly with the question I  mentioned two paragraphs back, which makes his work highly pertinent on  other grounds as well. His answer [p. 205] is that liberalism is indeed  \\"the last best hope for Judaism\\" -- the \\"worst solution  except for all the alternatives\\" -- but that Judaism and liberalism  may not be fully compatible anyway. \\"To the extent that the liberal  Enlightenment urges the abolition of [belief in] a particular providence  [as reflecting the spiritual core of Judaism and the fundamental Jewish  experience at Sinai], it will always be at odds with Judaism.\\"<br /><br />Note  Smith's careful phrasing on this point. His closing remark immediately  raises the question: _does_ liberalism require the \\"abolition\\" of  belief in a \\"particular providence\\"? I do not think it does, and  I think Spinoza was mistaken to argue otherwise.<br /><br />But I arrived at this view  in part through reflection on Smith's nuanced presentation in this volume.  I can only urge other readers interested in these questions to do likewise.Spinoza was mistaken to argue otherwise.

I didn't even know this eye-opening book was still listed on Amazon until someone pointed it out to me. What a shame that it's out of print.<br /><br />In it, the courageous Ellen Plasil details her horrifying experiences with  \\"Objectivist psychotherapist\\" Lonnie Leonard, a manipulative  sexual predator who nevertheless somehow managed to pass muster among the  ranks of Ayn Rand's \\"Objectivist\\" movement (with the blessing  even of the movement's \\"official\\" psychotherapists).<br /><br />Plasil's  upsetting account of Leonard's monstrous behavior should be read not only  by those interested in the misuses and abuses of \\"psychotherapy,\\"  but also -- and especially -- by those who still think Rand's  \\"Objectivism\\" might somehow be philosophically respectable if  only it were purged of some of its personal elements.<br /><br />On the contrary,  those \\"personal elements\\" infect very nearly the entirety of  Objectivism, and Leonard's behavior (particularly his manipulative  technique) is demonstrably connected to Rand's own  \\"philosophical\\" premises.<br /><br />And the Objectivist _movement_ (for the  propagandistic support of which most of Rand's nonfiction writings were  expressly developed) was never anything more \\"respectable\\" than a  psychologically totalitarian personality cult that allowed Rand and her  protege Nathaniel Branden to exercise personal power over their unwitting  victims in the official name of \\"reason.\\" Objectivists won't like  being reminded of this book's existence and will undoubtedly claim that  Leonard wasn't an exemplar of Rand's principles. And it is true that Rand  would have been horrified by Leonard's behavior.<br /><br />Nevertheless that behavior  was merely a physical implementation of the mindrape Rand and Branden had  been committing all along, as described in the posthumous Rand biographies  written by the two Brandens. Readers familiar with Objectivist history will  also see parallels with Rand's manipulative treatment of her own unemployed  and dependent husband in securing his \\"permission\\" for an  adulterous sexual affair with Nathaniel Branden -- and with her  self-serving contention that any _real_ man should have found her sexually  irresistible even if she were eighty years old and in a wheelchair.<br /><br />This  interesting approach to romantic love was, of course, offered in the name  of \\"reason,\\" and that is just how Leonard presented it to his own  victims.

Grayling's closing personal view  of Wittgenstein's contributions is too delightful to omit: &quot;the  journey through Wittgenstein's circuitous, metaphorical, sometimes opaque  negations and suggestions is long; but the distance it takes one is short.'	2000-03-26

Mendell Lewittes, a member of Yeshiva University's very first graduating class (1932) and a rabbi who served, it seems, all over North America for 35 years, here provides an excellent introductory overview of the history  and development of Halakha.    Beginning at the beginning (the creation of  man), Rabbi Lewittes places the foundation of Jewish law firmly on the  giving of divine commandments (mitzvot). The development of Jewish law  itself essentially begins at Sinai (though with the recognition that some  specifically Jewish mitzvot had been given prior to this time); the meaning  of Halakha is discussed and its integration with human life expounded.    The  reader is then led carefully through the Written Torah and the Oral Torah,  the eventual redaction of the Talmud, and the history of Halakha up to and  including the Shulchan Aruch. Four closing chapters deftly analyze four  modern \\"challenges\\" to Halakha: Hasidism; Reform; modern science  and medical practice; and Zionism. An epilogue presents a few views of  Rabbi Lewittes's own about the direction Halakha should take from here,  arguing among other things that the Modern Orthodox approach is capable of  both remaining true to Tradition and adapting it to modern needs.    Throughout his exposition, Rabbi Lewittes maintains a firmly  Maimonidean-rationalist outlook, striking just the right balance between  \\"The mitzvot _do_ make rational sense\\" and \\"Jews are  required to keep them anyway (when possible), even though they may not make  sense _to us_ right at the moment.\\" Insisting with the Rambam that  Jews are absolutely not required to believe anything that does violence to  human reason (and, indeed, how could _any_ mitzvot be in principle  unintelligible if they were given by a perfect Intelligence Who understands  Himself?), Rabbi Lewittes also clearly recognizes the limitations of the  human intellect and the need for a foundation of inviolable divine commands  in order to forestall rationalization.The result is a fine and careful  exposition that never ducks difficult questions, never fudges a point for  the sake of making things easy for the lazy reader, and yet will repay the  closest reading by anyone genuinely interested in what Halakha says and how  it works. This book belongs on the shelf of anyone who wants to learn more  about Jewish law.	2000-03-14

This volume is, I think, much more thorough and solid than the same author's earlier work, _Permission To Believe_, which was a bit more limited in scope and a bit weaker in its arguments (though still recommended).<br /><br />In this volume, something of a sequel to the other one, R.  Lawrence Kelemen develops four basic approaches to the rationality of the  belief that the Torah was divinely given.<br /><br />The first is straightforward  enough. R. Kelemen argues that an omnipotent and benevolent God can  reasonably be expected to have provided some sort of revelation and ensured  its faithful preservation; he then fishes around to see where in the world  this revelation might be. There are a number of monotheistic faiths, so how  do we choose? Well, every one of these faiths credits the Torah to God,  though each also claims to have superseded it. This latter claim undermines  itself, since the Torah itself says it will never be superseded. So . . .<br /><br />The second argument is pretty good too. R. Kelemen's burden in this chapter  is to show that the origins of Judaism are well attested by witnesses,  whereas the origins of several competing faiths are not. He manages the job  well, arguing fairly convincingly that if \\"all Israel\\" had _not_  heard God speak at Sinai, there really wouldn't have been any convenient  time at which this claim could have been slipped into the Tradition  unnoticed and unopposed.<br /><br />R. Kelemen then defends the status of the Torah as  divine revelation against two opposing views: secular biblical criticism,  and the (possible) claim that Jews are no more ethical than anyone else  even though they possess this supposed revelation.<br /><br />In the first case, he  wonders why secular Bible critics have ignored the mass of commentary in  the Talmud expressly devoted to explaining all the apparent textual  contradictions that secular critics seem to think nobody ever noticed  before. Then he marshals a host of recent archeological evidence indicating  that the Torah's history is sound.<br /><br />In the second case, he sets forth an  array of demographic data indicating that not only _are_ Jews unusually  ethical, but this unusually ethical behavior is also correlated with  Torah-observance.<br /><br />All in all, the volume is very successful. There may be  occasional gaps in the argument and various points over which we might  quibble, but R. Kelemen himself notes that he isn't trying to provide  rock-solid proof; besides, you can't accomplish everything under the sun in  a single book. And the evidence he _does_ present will probably leave the  reader thinking that it would take an act of faith _not_ to regard the  Torah as God-given.'s history is sound.

The damage we can do to others by our power of speech -- for example, by gossiping and by passing along rumors for no constructive purpose -- is a matter of great concern in Jewish tradition; one passage of Torah even  seems to indicate that embarrassing one's fellow publicly is tantamount to  a kind of murder. The most comprehensive works on this topic are those of  R. Yisrael Meir Kagan (the Chofetz Chaim), whose writings on Shmirat  ha-Lashon (the Laws of Proper Speech) are available from the Chofetz Chaim  Heritage Foundation.<br /><br />R. Joseph Telushkin has provided here a highly  readable and accessible introduction to this important topic, suitable for  Jews (of all levels of observance) and non-Jews alike.

This volume by Martin Sicker delivers exactly what the title promises: the political theology of the Torah. Sicker winds his way easily among the Tradition's views of God, man, and society, developing a sound account of  Jewish political theory.<br />In essence and in my own paraphrase, Sicker  argues that in the main and on the whole, the Jewish approach to politics  firmly subordinates &quot;society&quot; to the needs and the ethical  development of the individual. Politics, for Judaism, is not an end in  itself, still less an arena for bringing on the messianic age by human  effort, but a way of securing basic social harmony so that individual  persons can develop in accordance with the Tzelem Elohim. (This brief  summary does not, of course, do anything like full justice to the contents  of this fine book; Sicker's own account is richly nuanced and detailed,  with many citations from Traditional sources.)<br />To my mind, at least, one  of the outstanding merits of this work is that it _does_ stick to political  theology, providing a standard against which political life is to be  measured rather than specifically arguing for any one form of political  organization. Those who, like me, believe that classical liberalism and  capitalism are the proper form of societal organization on biblical and  rational grounds, and that twentieth-century liberal Judaism's turn to the  Left is a grave error, will naturally read Sicker's account as providing  the theological underpinnings of a free society. But his account can also  be profitably read by those who disagree with my politics _in toto_; it  thereby provides common theological ground for discussion and debate among  those who at least agree on foundational matters.<br />From this volume alone,  I have no idea what Sicker's own political views are -- and I mean that as  a compliment, given his selected topic. His focus is on theological  fundamentals, not on bending Jewish tradition to support his favorite  cause-of-the-day. In short, there is timeless wisdom in this book for  anyone who cares to read it.the-day. In short, there is timeless wisdom in this book for  anyone who cares to read it.	2000-03-07

In this slim volume, Rabbi Lawrence Kelemen sets out to grant &quot;permission to believe&quot; to those who would believe in God if they didn't think theism was irrational and/or unscientific.<br />He succeeds in  his limited aim, namely, that of providing short overviews of broad areas  of thought (e.g. morality, cosmology, teleology) that tend to converge on  theistic belief. And he is sometimes incisive in his critiques of opposing  viewpoints.<br />But not always. For example, in his opening chapter he argues  that atheism is irrational, on the (sole) grounds that positive knowledge  of God's nonexistence would require an exhaustive knowledge of everything  that exists. But we can know that, say, there are no square circles without  knowing _everything_ there is; what if -- as some atheists allege -- the  idea of God is somehow self-contradictory? It isn't, but R. Kelemen doesn't  address the point at all.<br />Similarly his views on &quot;morality&quot;  depend on an odd view of reason that already concedes too much to the other  side. Reason is not an adequate foundation for morality, he argues, because  (in effect) &quot;reason&quot; really amounts to nothing more than logical  deduction.<br />Here I'm afraid he missed an opportunity to argue for God  based on the very _rationality_ of ethics (and Torah ethics in particular).  Indeed, the existence of rationality itself could have been the foundation  for a powerful argument; in Maimonidean tradition, the faculty of reason is  the precise respect in which humans are said to be made in God's image.  Here as before, R. Kelemen seems to depend on an inadequate (and thoroughly  &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;secularist&quot;) account of reason and  rationality.<br />But we should not make too much of such oversights. R.  Kelemen's goal was not to provide a solid and irrefutable case for theistic  belief, but only to provide a short introduction to several fruitful lines  of thought that suggest the rationality of theism. His book will be useful  to those who have never considered such arguments before, though anyone  seriously pursuing these topics will undoubtedly want to move on to other  literature.theism.

In this his masterpiece, John McTaggart Ellis McTaggart develops his Idealist, more or less Hegelian metaphysics in painstaking detail. A clear, no-nonsense thinker who professed impatience with the sort of philosophy  that &quot;emanate[d] from the west of Scotland&quot; -- i.e. the  pleasantly sermonic sort of Idealism typically invoked for its sweet morals  and religion-friendly messages -- McTaggart was himself an atheist (and,  incidentally, a staunch supporter of the free market). In this massive  two-volume work, he argues that existence itself consists, at bottom, of  finite centers of experience related to one another through love.<br />Some of  his arguments have been tried and found wanting; his proof that time is  unreal (the famous bit about the A-series, the B-series, and the C-series)  has in particular not stood up to examination.

I'm delighted to see this work of Royce's in print; it wasn't, the last time I looked for it. Royce was one of the truly great American philosophers and I'm glad he hasn't been forgotten.<br />In this volume,  originally published in 1892 and based on a series of lectures, Royce  presents masterly critical overviews of such philosophers as Spinoza, Kant,  and Hegel, rendering in clear language what those philosophers (especially  Hegel) presented technically and with great complexity. This work will be  of interest both to readers of those other philosophers and to those who  want to trace their influence on Idealist philosophy.<br />There is also some  of Royce's own thought here. William James once teased Royce that he was in  the habit of writing long books and then sticking everything important that  he _really_ wanted to say in an appendix. This volume is no exception; one  of the later chapters presents what may be the clearest exposition of the  Idealist thesis ever presented. Royce was a fine expositor, and whether you  agree with his thesis or not, you will be hard pressed to find a better  presentation of it.<br />Royce was an unusual Idealist -- rather too  individualistic for the tastes of the block-universe fellows over in Great  Britain, and thus something of a heretic. He was a highly original thinker  whose influence is still felt today even when his name isn't mentioned.  (His influence on pragmatism alone is worthy of mention, but he also made  important critiques of Bradley and others that really should be taken up  into the current renaissance of Idealist studies.)<br />Royce, in short, still  very much deserves to be read. This volume is a fine place to start. (I see  that _The World and the Individual_ is in print again too, so try that one  next!)	2000-02-22

This volume _may_ be Royce's best work, and I'm delighted to see that it's available again (I had to buy a used copy when I looked for it some time ago). Royce was a genuinely great American philosopher and he still  deserves to be read. More individualistically inclined than his Idealist  brethren across the Atlantic, he was arguably also a more critical thinker  than his American Idealist contemporaries; for my money, the only  subsequent American philosopher to fill his footsteps was Brand Blanshard  (and he wasn't quite an Idealist).<br />Since _The Spirit of Modern  Philosophy_ is also available, I'd personally recommend that book to the  beginning reader of Royce. But do come back to this one. Most of Royce's  subsequent work is devoted to developing his philosophy of loyalty and his  vision of human community; it's very good, but he seldom returns to the  metaphysical issues he discusses here, at least not in this much  depth.<br />Now if we can just get _The Religious Aspect of Philosophy_ back  in print . . .	2000-02-22

Is this why you attack AS, because it is so opposed to your shining ideal? What is this ideal, so that I may know it and stand corrected?&quot;<br />Happy to oblige.  My positive standard is reason; my (relevant) ideals are liberty and  capitalism. Rand's are not.<br />Here are some points I've posted in earlier  reviews that have scrolled off their respective review pages, just by way  of pointing out a few of Rand's many philosophical errors.<br />1. In  epistemology, Rand regarded herself as having solved the &quot;problem of  universals&quot; when, in fact, she never raised it. Universals, if they  exist, are &quot;repeatable&quot; features of reality -- qualities or  relations that may be literally identical (not just &quot;exactly  similar&quot;) between disparate contexts. _Whether_ they exist is an  irreducibly ontological question, not (as Rand thinks) an epistemological  one. Rand fancied herself to have found a Third Way between nominalism and  realism (&quot;Objectivism&quot;) solely  because she identified  &quot;universals&quot; with concepts (and abstractions) in the opening  paragraphs of  ITOE. In metaphysics and epistemology, then,  &quot;Objectivism&quot; is nothing more than a not-very-self-critical form  of nominalism/conceptualism.<br />2. In ethics, Rand built  &quot;Objectivism&quot; on a foundation of pure _subjectivism_. Since her  ethic _presumes_ that one has made a positive &quot;choice to live,&quot;  Objectivism can give no guidance about whether to live or not, and all its  ethical injunctions rest on an arbitrary decision about which, strictly  speaking, Objectivism can't provide any instruction. In ethics, then,  &quot;Objectivism&quot; is nothing more than a not-very-self-critical form  of subjectivism.<br />Moreover, having dispensed with any ultimate, objective  ethical standard, Rand tried to introduce one anyway by insisting that  anyone who did _not_ put the Objectivist ethic into practice was quite  literally subhuman, even subanimal. She arrived at this insane view by  (very much against her own  epistemological standards) identifying  &quot;human&quot; with just _one_ attribute of human beings: namely,   rationality (understood in her own highly inadequate way). To see how this  view works out in practice, read pp. 1054-55 of ATLAS SHRUGGED, where Dagny  Taggart quite unnecessarily  shoots a guard who has &quot;proven&quot;  himself to be less than an animal.<br />3. In politics, Rand sapped all  distinctive meaning from the moral concept of &quot;rights&quot; by making  respect for rights depend solely on self-interest (rather than making  justice foundational and deriving an ethic/politics of  _self-responsibility_ from that foundation). That means that, in strict  consistency, the only moral guidance Objectivism can offer to anyone  contemplating Hitler-like atrocities is that it's a mistake to louse up  one's _own_ life so badly. In political theory, then,  &quot;Objectivism&quot; is nothing more than a not-very-self-critical form  of might-makes-right: treating other people as Hitler did is  &quot;wrong&quot; only because, in the long run, an &quot;egoist&quot;  can't _get away_ with it. (Of course Rand wrote her essay &quot;The Pull  Peddlers&quot; precisely because she thought people _could_ get away with  taking unjust advantage of each other through the use of government power.  That this undermined her case for &quot;egoism&quot; seems never to have  crossed her mind.)<br />Moreover, her claim that a government requires a legal  monopoly on the use of retaliatory force is a very foolish recipe for  totalitarianism. The entire federalist system (including the Second  Amendment) is supposed to _prevent_ just such a monopoly.<br />These are not  her only errors by any means; Rand redefined quite a few terms and never  let on -- perhaps because she  didn't know any better, and more likely  because one of her major purposes was to subvert traditional philosophy  altogether. The result is that she not only misrepresents the thought of  everyone else, but also makes it almost impossible for her _readers_ to  understand anyone else.<br />Everybody knows the obvious examples: she left  the words &quot;exclusive or excessive&quot; out of her definition of  &quot;selfishness,&quot; she redefined &quot;sacrifice&quot; as the giving  up of a _greater_ value for a _lesser_ one, and what she meant by  &quot;altruism&quot; has never been defended by anyone important at  all.  Even on her own premises, what she should have defended was an ethic of  _eudaimonism_ in which the distinction between &quot;egoism&quot; and  &quot;altruism&quot; is of no fundamental importance since our real  interests are not ultimately in conflict.<br />Less well known: she thought  &quot;a priori,&quot; &quot;analytic,&quot; and &quot;necessary&quot; were  synonyms, and likewise &quot;a posteriori,&quot; &quot;synthetic,&quot; and  &quot;contingent&quot; (no two terms in either triplet are synonymous);   and she understood  both &quot;subjective&quot; and &quot;relative&quot; to  mean &quot;arbitrary&quot; (which they don't, nor are they synonymous with   each other). Even the central term &quot;objective&quot; suffers at her  hands; what most people mean by &quot;objective,&quot; she calls  &quot;intrinsic.&quot;<br />Not only did she anathematize by misdefinition,  she sometimes intentionally misrepresented the ideas of other people. Any  philosophically informed reader can see this happening on nearly every page  she wrote, but here's my own favorite example: in &quot;Philosophical  Detection&quot; (in _Philosophy: Who Needs It_), she incorrectly attributed  the saying, &quot;Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds,&quot; to  &quot;a very little mind, Emerson&quot; -- knowing full well that the  _correct_ version of the quote is, &quot;A _foolish_ consistency is the  hobgoblin of little minds.&quot;<br />(How doI know she knew better? I have  an acquaintance who worked with Rand when the piece was originally  published. The error was pointed out to her; she refused to correct it. And  see Emerson's essay &quot;Self-reliance&quot; for the context of this  quotation. He's not knocking logical consistency; he's arguing that it's  silly to refuse to change your mind just because it might confuse other  people.)<br />The bottom line: Rand was a propagandist, not a philosopher.  Those of us who really _do_ stand for reason, liberty, capitalism and all  that nice stuff object to her because her &quot;defenses&quot; of them were  so often incompetent and dishonest.	2000-02-10

Meir Tamari, also the author of _The Challenge of Wealth_ and _Al Chet: Sins in the Marketplace_, here provides an excellent overview of Jewish ethics and economic life. Dr. Tamari presents a solid case that Judaism  regards economic activity as legitimate and honorable, and at the same time  dispels common antisemitic myths about Jews and money.<br />Beginning with a  broad discussion of the limitations Judaism places on economic activity,  Dr. Tamari then provides a short survey of Jewish economic history and a  selection of responsa on economic disputes. He then devotes several  chapters to such topics as tzedakah and taxation, clearly and cogently  summarizing what Halakha says about each. The resulting volume will be of  great value to anyone who wants to know what Judaism says about economic  practice.<br />It will, however, be less helpful to those who want to learn  something about economics -- though it should be added at once that (a)  teaching economic principles was not Dr. Tamari's purpose in this volume  and (b) at any rate his &quot;sins&quot; in this regard are at least no  worse than those of standard mainstream economics textbooks. Still, a  sounder economic approach would surely have made the exposition clearer on  other topics.<br />Dr. Tamari is probably just bending over backwards to keep  his discussion of Judaism free from commitment to any particular view of  economics, while acknowledging that Judaism tends to favor the free market.  Unfortunately he therefore sometimes writes that a &quot;society&quot; is  free to allocate &quot;its&quot; resources by whatever &quot;market  mechanism&quot; it wishes, from the free market to central planning --  ignoring both the economic fact that central planning is not a &quot;market  mechanism&quot; at all, and the ethical fact that a State-run economy  cannot help but violate the very principles of justice and righteousness  that Dr. Tamari otherwise presents so well. In fact, these principles  themselves would rule out communism and socialism completely; the  institution of private property, together with its corollary prohibitions  on theft and fraud, should have committed Judaism to free-market economics,  properly understood.<br />The underlying difficulty here seems lie with Dr.  Tamari's conception of what a free market _is_. I say this because he is  constantly remarking that Judaism allows certain &quot;distortions&quot; of  the free market, when in fact most of the &quot;distortions&quot; he cites  are not distortions at all -- or at least need not be, depending how they  are encouraged or enforced. (If I am not mistaken, Dr. Tamari studied at  the London School of Economics, not exactly a hotbed of free-market  thought. The fact that he recognizes an important role for the free market  _at all_ is therefore highly commendable.)<br />All of which means only that  Dr. Tamari is one of many people who could profit from a closer reading of  Ludwig von Mises and other economists of the Austrian school -- at least to  get clear what does and does not constitute a &quot;distortion&quot; of the  free market (and in particular to get clear that Jewish religious/ethical  observances do not constitute such &quot;distortions&quot;). This fact does  not in any way tell against his fine presentation of Judaism's  &quot;take&quot; on economics, but it does occasionally distort his  presentation of important economic principles.ves would rule out communism and socialism completely; the  institution of private property, together with its corollary prohibitions  on theft and fraud, should have committed Judaism to free-market economics,  properly understood.<br />The underlying difficulty here seems lie with Dr.  Tamari's conception of what a free market _is_.

Absolute Idealism isn't dead, and Timothy Sprigge has breathed new life into one of its incarnations: panpsychism.<br />In this fascinating volume, Sprigge elaborates and defends the view that ultimately, reality consists of &quot;experience&quot; -- little nuggets of it, integrated into one  tremendous overarching Experience. Sound implausible? Not after Sprigge is  through; he presents his thesis clearly and cogently, and offers several  genuinely new arguments for it (including a nicely developed view of  physical entities as &quot;concrete universals&quot;).<br />Since I happen to  find Sprigge's thesis intuitively plausible and in some ways highly  attractive, I am also inclined to be extremely critical of arguments in its  favor; it is notoriously easy to be misled to a desired conclusion. (I also  suspect, from what I have read of Sprigge's other works, that he draws  ethical and political conclusions from this thesis with which I would  disagree.) But I shall not critique his arguments here; suffice it to say  that Sprigge renders panpsychism at least newly defensible. At any rate  some of the reading is tough going, and I shall have to reread his  arguments a few more times before I am dead sure I have followed them  correctly.<br />But some of the recent work done in the current &quot;Idealist  renaissance&quot; has persuaded me to take another look at several theses  that I had earlier thought it necessary to abandon. Sprigge's fascinating  work in this volume is at the top of the list. It is highly recommended to  anyone who finds materialism implausible and dualism an unhappy compromise.  At the very least, it is an important contribution to a generations-long  dialogue and its arguments deserve to be considered.	2000-01-26

Mendell Lewittes, a member of Yeshiva University's very first graduating class (1932) and a rabbi who served, it seems, all over North America for  35 years, here provides an excellent introductory overview of the history  and development of Halakha.<br />Beginning at the beginning (the creation of  man), Rabbi Lewittes places the foundation of Jewish law firmly on the  giving of divine commandments (mitzvot). The development of Jewish law  itself essentially begins at Sinai (though with the recognition that some  specifically Jewish mitzvot had been given prior to this time); the meaning  of Halakha is discussed and its integration with human life expounded. The  reader is then led carefully through the Written Torah and the Oral Torah,  the eventual redaction of the Talmud, and the history of Halakha up to and  including the Shulchan Aruch. Four closing chapters deftly analyze four  modern &quot;challenges&quot; to Halakha: Hasidism; Reform; modern science  and medical practice; and Zionism. An epilogue presents a few views of  Rabbi Lewittes's own about the direction Halakha should take from here,  arguing among other things that the Modern Orthodox approach is capable of  both remaining true to Tradition and adapting it to modern  needs.<br />Throughout his exposition, Rabbi Lewittes maintains a firmly  Maimonidean-rationalist outlook, striking just the right balance between  &quot;The mitzvot _do_ make rational sense&quot; and &quot;Jews are  required to keep them anyway (when possible), even though they may not make  sense _to us_ right at the moment.&quot; Insisting with the Rambam that  Jews are absolutely not required to believe anything that does violence to  human reason (and, indeed, how could _any_ mitzvot be in principle  unintelligible if they were given by a perfect Intelligence Who understands  Himself?), Rabbi Lewittes also clearly recognizes the limitations of the  human intellect and the need for a foundation of inviolable divine commands  in order to forestall rationalization.<br />The result is a fine and careful  exposition that never ducks difficult questions, never fudges a point for  the sake of making things easy for the lazy reader, and yet will repay the  closest reading by anyone genuinely interested in what Halakha says and how  it works. This book belongs on the shelf of anyone who wants to learn more  about Jewish law.er to forestall rationalization.<br />The result is a fine and careful  exposition that never ducks difficult questions, never fudges a point for  the sake of making things easy for the lazy reader, and yet will repay the  closest reading by anyone genuinely interested in what Halakha says and how  it works.

Now let's see: Rand was wrong about government financing, and she was wrong to be averse to &quot;violent civil resistance&quot; -- arguing that government requires a territorial monopoly on the legal use of force, in  direct conflict with the Second Amendment specifically and the logic of  federalism generally. So if we put her view of government into practice,  we'd have a totalitarian State that couldn't pay for itself out of  voluntary contributions, and we'd have an unarmed citizenry that wasn't  allowed to resist. So the State would do . . . what? And this is moral? On  what planet? (Am I the only one who sees an &quot;Ominous Parallel&quot;  here?)<br />She also invoked &quot;rational selfishness&quot; as the moral  basis of capitalism, leaving out any &quot;garbage&quot; about the  &quot;common good.&quot; Now, that latter phrase ordinarily means the good  literally common to all human beings (usually within a single society). In  leaving out such &quot;garbage,&quot; Rand would appear to have left out a  powerful argument for capitalism: that it serves our _genuine_ &quot;common  good,&quot; by providing a society in which the rights of _each_ person are  protected and respected. (Rand _did_ claim to have provided an  &quot;egoistic&quot; foundation for those rights, but (a) it mostly isn't  in this volume, and (b) it mostly isn't any good. I won't critique it here  since it's in _The Virtue of Selfishness_.)<br />As for &quot;rational  selfishness&quot; as the moral foundation for capitalism: the free market  provides economic checks and balances on _all_ behavior involving  exchangeable goods -- including &quot;altruistic&quot; behavior like  philanthropy and charitable contributions. As a moral foundation,  &quot;rational altruism&quot; would have worked just as well. In fact the  entire egoism/altruism dichotomy is beside the point; it's the  &quot;rational&quot; part that's essential. (And I beg to doubt that Rand's  understanding of &quot;rationality&quot; was adequate anyway.)<br />Hmm. There  doesn't seem to be all that much left of Rand's _moral_ case for  capitalism.<br />Nevertheless, as I've stated in my previous reviews, I still  think this is her best book for quite other reasons, and she does do a fair  job of cutting through some _other_ people's nonsense. Just be careful with  her own.	2000-01-10

Yep, &quot;critically, sentence by sentence&quot; is exactly how you have to read Rand -- otherwise she'll get away with murder.<br />Take the previous reviewer's first example: &quot;Metaphysically, life is the only phenomenon  that is an end in itself: a value gained and kept by a constant process of  action.&quot; [That's from &quot;The Objectivist Ethics,&quot; in this  volume.] Now Rand insisted repeatedly (e.g. in her letters to John Hospers,  reprinted in _The Letters of Ayn Rand_) that when she defined a word, she  stuck to the meaning she had assigned it. Yet in her argument here, she  passes insensibly from &quot;biological life&quot; to &quot;life with  integrity,&quot; even allowing in _Atlas Shrugged_ that one might commit  biological suicide in order to _preserve_ one's integrity. So much for life  as an end in itself. In fact biological life is of purely instrumental  value -- i.e. as a means to the achievement of values which really _are_  ends in themselves. But what Rand does is to build her own favorite virtues  into the meaning of &quot;life as man _qua_ man,&quot; and thereby define  anyone who doesn't practice those virtues as quite literally  _subhuman_.<br />Or take the previous reviewer's second example:  &quot;Epistemologically, the concept of 'value' is genetically dependent  upon and derived from the antecedent concept of 'life.'&quot; This is just  nonsense, as Rand's own example of the &quot;indestructible robot&quot;  shows. She wants to insist that an indestructible robot can't have any  values -- but she does it by building in to her statement the hypothesis  that the robot can't be affected by _anything_ in _any_ way whatsoever (a  much stronger condition than simple indestructibility). Her argument that  value depends on life (really, on &quot;mortality&quot;) is therefore just  bad. There's no reason in the world why immortal beings couldn't have  values.<br />You'll spot her doing this sort of thing right and left. She'll  tell you on one page that &quot;values&quot; make sense only for beings who  can make choices in the face of alternatives -- and then turn around and  tell you that plants have values that they have no alternative but to seek.  She'll tell you that the very first question in ethics is whether we _need_  ethics at all -- and not only ignore the fact that &quot;need&quot; is  already an ethically loaded term, but then turn around later in the volume  and argue that &quot;need&quot; can't be the basis for any of our claims  against one another. This despite her just-as-equivocal argument that  &quot;rights&quot; are based directly on needs -- a well-known passage in  which she passes without acknowledgement from the statement that &quot;it  is right&quot; for man to use his mind, etc., to the statement that  &quot;he has a right&quot; to do those things. The woman who allegedly  never altered the meaning of her words in fact did it all the time -- she  just didn't notice.<br />This volume's worst flaw is, as I've said elsewhere,  that Rand tries to alter the meaning of &quot;human being&quot; or  &quot;man's life&quot; so that it means, not biological life, but the sort  of life she regards as moral. I'm not disagreeing that such a life _is_  moral, but it's a sign of trouble when you try to base an ethic directly on  biological life and immediately find yourself distorting that standard to  fit  your conclusions. There are two standards here, and Rand conflates  them; the result is not elevation, but corruption.<br />As a matter of  biological fact, a human being is a human being from conception to death,  no matter how immoral we may be in between. To equate immorality with  subhumanity is to provide a fig leaf of legitimacy for anyone who really  _does_ want to get away with murder.	2000-01-07

John Robbins is unlikely to receive much respect from Objectivists, since he is a devout Christian -- a sola-scriptura Biblical inerrantist whose critiques of Rand are mounted on a thoroughly Calvinist foundation and  offered for clearly evangelical purposes. The loss is theirs; Robbins knows  &quot;Objectivism&quot; better than most of Ayn Rand's most devoted  followers -- including its all too numerous flaws.<br />Nor should  Objectivists ignore his critiques merely because they are  &quot;religious,&quot; since it is only in their own minds that  &quot;religion&quot; is automatically irrational. Robbins is a follower of  the late Gordon H. Clark (familiar to one audience as a highly respected  scholar of Hellenistic philosophy, and to another as a party to a  well-known theological controversy with Cornelius van Til). Calvinism is no  friend of irrationality and, especially as interpreted by Clark, assigns a  _very_ high place to reason and logic. As a student of Clark, Robbins  develops his critiques with more respect for reason than Rand ever showed  in her entire life.<br />The author of _Answer to Ayn Rand_ (a 1970s work that  did not receive a like answer from the Objectivist establishment), Robbins  has reworked and expanded his critique for this volume, also adding  appendices to deal respectively with Leonard Peikoff and David Kelley. His  central contention is quite a straightforward one, and in my view it is  essentially correct though I would quibble about some details. It is this:  Rand started with her conclusions and worked backwards, very badly, to  transfer those conclusions onto a foundation that will not support them. As  her libertarian, free-market capitalist, limited-government conclusions in  fact depend on a view of man and society that properly and in strict  consistency belongs to Christianity (I would say to Western monotheism  generally), they are -- for Rand -- &quot;stolen concepts.&quot; It is only  a matter of time until some of her followers work her premises _forward_  and wind up with very different conclusions indeed. (And probably anyone  who has ever participated or lurked in an Objectivist discussion forum  knows that the day Robbins fears has already come.)<br />His demolition job is  mostly an able one, with only an occasional misfire. Space will not permit  a full discussion of Robbins's contentions here, but in my own view his  best chapters are his sustained attacks on Rand's epistemology and  theology. With a keen eye for Rand's numerous self-contradictions, Robbins  demonstrates repeatedly that Rand did not succeed even in presenting a  coherent position, let alone supporting it with evidence or  argument.<br />Especially good are his attacks on Rand's  &quot;empiricism&quot; and &quot;materialism,&quot; positions she did not  officially support although Robbins is correct that she was committed to  them anyway. (Or at least would have been, if she had been consistent. Rand  was famous for claiming she had overcome false dichotomies when she had  merely ignored real ones.) He is also particularly trenchant on the topic  of &quot;volitional consciousness&quot; and Rand's allegation that human  beings are somehow self-creating. And he clearly recognizes the link  between Rand's standards for who is and is not &quot;human&quot; (in  violation of even her own stated epistemological principles) and her  unconscionable views on abortion. His critiques of Peikoff and Kelley  mostly hit their marks as well, though again space will not permit me to  detail them here.<br />In short, despite some blemishes, this volume is the  ablest critique of Objectivism currently in print, and I am glad to see it  has finally become available through Amazon.followers work her premises _forward_  and wind up with very different conclusions indeed.

There are precious few systematic works being written these days on Jewish theology -- perhaps because Judaism is sometimes regarded as in some way  opposed to theology.<br /><br />Louis Jacobs deals with that objection directly in the  very first pages of this fine work. \\"Jewish theology,\\" he begins,  \\"is the attempt to think through consistently the implications of the  Jewish religion.\\"<br /><br />That this task requires a degree of humility and  even ends in agnosticism on some specific points, Jacobs readily  acknowledges. But, he argues, the \\"dangers of pride and  dogmatism\\" should merely prevent \\"theological smugness,\\" not  forestall the enterprise of theology itself.<br /><br />In a workmanlike series of  twenty-two further chapters, Jacobs devotes his attention to the task he  has set himself, dealing in turn with e.g. the unity of God; transcendence  and immanence; omnipotence and omniscience; providence; the love and the  fear of God; the nature of revelation; Torah and mitzvah; sin and  repentance; the Messianic hope; and the afterlife. At each point his  discussion is solidly rooted in the traditional texts of Judaism  (including, of course, Torah and Talmud).<br /><br />His views on the central topic of  _revelation_ are, it must be said, \\"liberal\\" in the final  analysis; while highly critical of the idea of \\"progressive  revelation\\" and adopting what he calls a \\"traditionalist\\"  view, he is nevertheless forced to acknowledge in the end that his  interpretation of revelation in \\"non-propositional terms\\" is  \\"certainly not the traditional one.\\" And I confess myself to be  skeptical that his account can provide full support for even his own  understanding of the nature of the mitzvot.<br /><br />But whatever his particular  conclusions on specific points, and above all whether one agrees with them  or not, his thorough discussion of Jewish theology is fair and even-handed  in content, reasonable and empathetic in tone. And his unblinking  willingness to deal with the problems specifically raised by modernity is  altogether commendable.<br /><br />This volume, then, will not answer every possible  question about Jewish theology. But if one wants a book that asks the  questions well and tries to sort out what answers make sense in the light  of both tradition and modernity without lapsing into  \\"fundamentalism\\" on _either_ side, Jacobs has done that job here.

In this remarkable volume -- unfortunately not now in print -- Pinchas Lapide, an Orthodox Jewish scholar of the New Testament, mounts a surprising argument that the resurrection of Jesus was a historical event.<br /><br />Dr. Lapide, recognizing that Christianity stands or falls with the  resurrection itself, regards Jesus the man as a Torah-faithful Jew  \\"who wanted to bring the kingdom of heaven in harmony, concord, and  peace.\\" Noting that the resuscitation of the dead by God is, and has  long been, a part of Jewish belief, he examines the New Testament accounts  of the resurrection of Jesus and finds what he describes as a \\"Jewish  faith experience\\" in full consonance with the historical teachings of  Judaism.<br /><br />He concludes as follows: \\"[A]s a faithful Jew, I cannot  explain a historical development which, despite many errors and much  confusion, has carried the central message of Israel into the world of the  nations, as the result of blind happenstance, or human error, or a  materialistic determinism . . . . [T]he Easter faith has to be recognized  as a part of divine providence.\\"<br /><br />He does not regard resurrection as  literally \\"miraculous,\\" if that word denotes an arbitrary  suspension of cause and effect. But he does not see why a resurrection is  any more \\"miraculous\\" than a birth -- in which, after all, dead  matter in some way springs to life as a person. If once, why not twice?<br /><br />He  also points out carefully that the resurrection does not make Jesus  \\"the Messiah of Israel for Jewish people.\\" Jesus, he insists  (with textual support from two millennia of Jewish history, including Moses  Maimonides), was/is a \\"paver of the way\\" for the Messiah, not  (necessarily) the Messiah himself -- though Dr. Lapide has said elsewhere  that if the Messiah comes and _does_ turn out to be Jesus, that will of  course be fine with him.<br /><br />All in all, this marvelous little book is  thought-provoking in its own right, utterly remarkable as a sympathetic  Jewish understanding of Christianity, and a tremendous contribution to  Jewish-Christian dialogue that has not, to my knowledge, received the  attention it deserves. I hope it comes back into print.

Does a just human society require a centralized, paternalistic State? Randy Barnett says it requires only a social order of a certain kind, namely one characterized by his chosen subtitle, \\"justice and the rule  of law.\\"<br /><br />In this brilliant work, which should be read as soon as  possible by all parties to the anarchism/minarchism debate, Barnett tries  to show what such a social order might look like. Here I shall briefly  summarize the book's contents.<br /><br />In an introductory chapter, \\"Liberty  vs. license,\\" he discusses just enough of the philosophy of  \\"natural law\\" and \\"natural rights\\" to let his readers  know he is _not_ writing a book about them and that his subsequent analysis  does not stand or fall with any particular understanding of the origin of  rights.<br /><br />He then plunges, in Part 1, into the \\"Problem of  Knowledge,\\" which occupies the next five chapters. Here he deals in  turn with what he calls the first-, second-, and third-order problems of  knowledge: using resources, communicating justice, and specifying  conventions. (Importantly, he acknowledges that \\"background  rights\\" to life and property are not sufficient to determine the  specific forms these rights should take in every case. What he has called  the \\"third-order problem\\" -- specifying conventions that secure  justice -- is thus not settled merely by an abstract account of  \\"rights.\\") His argument here, of course, is that the  classical-liberal conception of justice and the rule of law is what is  needed in order to solve these knowledge problems.<br /><br />Part 2 (chapters 7-9)  deals with what Barnett identifies as the \\"Problems of Interest\\"  (problems of partiality, incentive, and compliance) and Part 3 (chapters  10-14) with the \\"Problems of Power\\" (problems of enforcement  error, fighting crime without punishment, and enforcement abuse). Here he  argues that the liberal conception of justice and the rule of law solves  these problems -- helpfully devoting chapters 13 and 14, respectively, to a  more or less abstract discussion of a \\"polycentric\\"  constitutional order and to a \\"short fable\\" envisioning  concretely how such an order might work in practice.<br /><br />Finally (Part 4,  consisting of chapter 15), he devotes nearly thirty pages to consideration  of possible criticisms. His trenchant closing remarks on \\"the limits  of criticism\\" should be taken to heart by all parties to the debate.<br /><br />I myself find his arguments cogent and compelling. Possibly some supporters  of a minimal, limited State will find them less so. But be that as it may,  Barnett has significantly advanced the debate with this fine volume, and no  participants can claim to have dealt adequately with  \\"anarcho-capitalism\\" until they have dealt also with Barnett.more or less abstract discussion of a \\"polycentric\\"  constitutional order and to a \\"short fable\\" envisioning  concretely how such an order might work in practice.

Michael Oakeshott propounds a startling thesis in this dense but rewarding work. Before I tell you what it is, let me explain how he sets it up.<br />After a short introduction, Oakeshott devotes his second chapter to  the title topic: &quot;Experience and its Modes.&quot; Here he carefully  and solidly expounds the Idealist contention that experience is coextensive  with judgment/thought; that the principle of coherence gives the meaning of  &quot;truth&quot; and that the principle of &quot;correspondence&quot;  fails for want of an answer to the question, &quot;Correspondence to  _what_?&quot;; that the aim of philosophy is experience without  presupposition or &quot;arrest.&quot;<br />That's the setup. Now, in his next  three chapters, Oakeshott considers the &quot;worlds&quot; of history,  science, and practical life, showing in detail that each is _almost_ a  complete world unto itself that must be criticized, if at all, on its own  terms -- and yet that taking any of these as a _fully_ complete world would  be what he has called an &quot;arrest&quot; in experience, in effect the  mistaking of incompleteness for completeness.<br />The first side of this  double-edged blade is crucial for one of Oakeshott's aims. He is at great  pains to avoid, and to argue against, &quot;irrelevance&quot; or  &quot;ignoratio elenchi,&quot; and in order to do so he must show that  criticism of a &quot;world&quot; can be offered only on that  &quot;world's&quot; own terms. There is no shortcut; in order to  &quot;refute&quot; a system of life or thought, it is necessary to enter  into it and show, in Oakeshott's words, both the half-truth in the error  and the error in the half-truth. None of the &quot;worlds&quot; he  examines, in his view, is wholly false; each represents an important  partial truth.<br />But neither is any of them wholly true, and here is where  the other side of his blade comes into play. To take the worlds of history,  science, and practical life as _complete_ worlds would be to defeat the aim  of philosophy, which aims at experience without such arrests. And it is  here that he is at his most striking; sympathetically and accurately  entering into each of these &quot;worlds&quot; in turn, he deftly  demonstrates that each is incomplete and therefore, in the final analysis  (well, synthesis),  philosophically unsatisfactory.<br />That, at any rate, is  what I take Oakeshott to have done in this volume. But of course he has  much more to say than I can possibly summarize here; interested readers  should study the book for themselves. It is not _easy_ reading by any  means, but the rewards are well worth the effort.e_ worlds would be to defeat the aim  of philosophy, which aims at experience without such arrests.

This volume, a revised and updated paperback edition of _Miss Manners Saves Civilization_, is not just a handy reference manual on questions of etiquette but a sustained discourse on the _importance_ of etiquette to  civilization itself.<br />It is not an accident that the words  &quot;civility&quot; and &quot;politeness&quot; derive respectively from  the Latin and Greek words for &quot;city.&quot; Wherever people live  together, there is a need for a basic level of mutual respect to grease the  wheels of our interaction and to remind us to keep our impulses under  control for the sake of our common good.<br />Thus treating one another with  respect, says Miss Manners (Judith Martin), is the heart of _manners_, and  the conventions by which we do so are the rules of _etiquette_. Manners  have therefore traditionally been accorded a place alongside morals, and  etiquette alongside ethics.<br />Etiquette has no coercive &quot;enforcement  mechanism&quot; but depends solely on (private and public) shows of  disapproval: a raised eyebrow, a sharp word, even boycotts, shunning, and  ostracism. When it falls into disrepute and bad manners run rampant, there  is a grave danger that mutual respect will be enforced more coercively and  less flexibly -- by law.<br />Miss Manners deplores this prospect; good  manners are too context-dependent for the law to manage them properly, and  at any rate jail time seems a harsh punishment for at least some of the  milder breaches of etiquette. Thus her task: to restore good manners to  their proper place in society and make etiquette the _first_ line of  defense against incivility. (Libertarians should be cheering.)<br />And for  those who think etiquette mainly concerns which fork to use, Miss Manners  settles _that_ question very early on: there will never be more than three  forks on the table at any time (any others will be brought with the courses  for which they are required); you should always use the one furthest to the  left; hold it as you would a pencil.<br />There, that was easy, wasn't it? Now  you can read the book for its real content :-).hold it as you would a pencil.<br />There, that was easy, wasn't it? Now  you can read the book for its real content :-).	1999-12-21

Rabbi Daniel Lapin says yes, and argues that such attacks should stop: in his view, the U.S. is and should remain a _culturally_ Christian nation.<br />Christianity, he maintains, provides a proper basis for human  liberty, a solid foundation for the free market, and (importantly) a place  for Torah-true Judaism in American society. A secular culture can do none  of these things.<br />Rabbi Lapin is under no illusion that there are no  important theological differences between Judaism and Christianity; on the  contrary, he knows full well that agreement on such matters is not strictly  possible for those who remain faithful to their own traditions. However, as  he is also at pains to show, Christianity incorporates enough principles of  Mosaic law that Torah-observant Jews can feel safe in a Christian  culture.<br />Not so a secular culture, he warns. Secularism is at present  cruising on fuel it borrowed from Western religious tradition; once that  fuel is exhausted, anything goes.<br />Many theologically liberal Jews have  therefore, in Rabbi Lapin's view, been fighting the wrong enemy. The real  foe is not &quot;anti-Semitism&quot;; it is irreligion. Whatever their  theological differences, Christianity and Judaism should be brothers in  arms in the fight for America's culture.<br />Agree or disagree, Rabbi Lapin's  case is solidly mounted and strikingly put. His book should be read by  anyone interested in the preservation of liberty.	1999-12-21

Pirkei Avot (\\"Chapters of the fathers\\") is both the best-loved portion of the Mishnah and also the Jewish text (other than the Bible itself) most familiar to non-Jews. Rabbi Shlomo Toperoff has thus done a  tremendous service to all in providing a comprehensive commentary on this  text.<br /><br />And comprehensive it is. Drawing on Jewish sources, Rabbi Toperoff  presents a line-by-line commentary on the entire text of Avot (which is  presented both in Hebrew and in English translation). At the end of each  section is a brief selection of relevant remarks from Hasidic lore.<br /><br />The  resulting 440-page volume will be a helpful addition to the library of  anyone who wants a thorough, accessible, and Tradition-based commentary on  Jewish ethics. In particular, since the ethical mitzvot are still  officially regarded as binding even in the Reformest of Reform Judaism,  this volume should help to provide common ground for respectful and  mutually sympathetic dialogue among all branches of modern Jewry.	1999-12-18

Bradley). Unfortunately both he and the  \\"neo-Hegelian\\" tradition he represented have since been eclipsed  by analytical philosophy -- Moore and Russell having undermined the  Idealists' speculative metaphysics, and Karl Popper having quite unfairly  tagged Hegelian thought as a statist enemy of the \\"open society.\\"<br /><br />But thanks to the efforts of William Sweet and a handful of other scholars,  a renaissance in Idealist studies is afoot. And the present work is as fine  a contribution to it as I have seen.<br /><br />In this volume Sweet sets himself the  task of recovering Bosanquet's doctrine of _rights_. That Bosanquet even  _had_ such a doctrine may come as a surprise to anyone who knows of  Bosanquet only through secondary sources, but he did indeed develop a  fairly thorough account of rights in _The Philosophical Theory of the  State_ and elsewhere. Since the table of contents of Sweet's marvelous work  is helpfully listed on this page, I shall keep my comments brief.<br /><br />Bosanquet's account of rights is thoroughly teleological: he holds that  both rights themselves and their moral authority derive from their  contribution to a common end which consists at heart of a society in which  everyone is able to live a \\"good life.\\" For him, the existence  and action of the \\"state\\" are justified precisely insofar as they  contribute toward this end. Central to this account is Bosanquet's doctrine  of the \\"real will,\\" of which Sweet provides an excellent  exposition.<br /><br />Basically, in my own paraphrase, one's \\"real will\\"  consists of what one _would_ explicitly want, all things considered, if one  were fully and completely rational.  Sweet provides a thorough and careful  explication of this centrally important concept (including an admirable  account of why it should be called our \\"_real_\\" will).<br /><br />This  doctrine, which strongly influenced Brand Blanshard's similar account (in  _Reason and Goodness_) of what he called the \\"rational will,\\" has  been attacked on any number of grounds (notably by Hobhouse early this  century), and part of Sweet's concern is to defend it against contentions  that it e.g. leads to statism, fails to assign the proper place to  individual good, and so forth. He handles the task well, and to my mind  makes a case that should be heard by libertarians and free-marketers of all  stripes.<br /><br />(My own view, for what it is worth, is that Bosanquet's  teleological account of rights is essentially correct and with almost no  modification can be invoked to provide the real basis of the libertarian  society. I do not think statist conclusions follow from Bosanquet's  premises at all; indeed, I think Austrian economics would benefit from  placing its analysis of \\"market process\\" on such a philosophical  foundation.)<br /><br />Sweet's volume is enormously helpful for another reason:  Bosanquet's own prose style has been found somewhat uncongenial by many  readers. Despite a brilliance that repays close reading, he does at times  stand in need of a more felicitous expositor who can make clear what  Bosanquet himself leaves rather obscure. Sweet is a fine expository prose  stylist and handles this task with clarity and skill.This  doctrine, which strongly influenced Brand Blanshard's similar account (in  _Reason and Goodness_) of what he called the \\"rational will,\\" has  been attacked on any number of grounds (notably by Hobhouse early this  century), and part of Sweet's concern is to defend it against contentions  that it e.g. leads to statism, fails to assign the proper place to  individual good, and so forth.

Rabbi Daniel Feldman has set himself a formidable task in this volume: to spell out in a generally accessible way what Jewish law says about human relationships.<br />His task is, in part, to respond to those (far too many)  people who see Halakha as &quot;ritualistic&quot; and as having little to  say on this important topic. It is also, in part, to help provide those who  _are_ Traditionally observant with a helpful overaching framework that  makes sense of their practices at the interpersonal level.<br />He succeeds  wonderfully. In each of a dozen-plus areas, he provides a careful overview  of the relevant portions of Halakha, sifting with great competence through  a wide range of rabbinic opinions and citing their sources in Torah.<br />For  example, the very first chapter concerns the Halakhic prohibition on  embarrassing one's fellow publicly, which Torah regards as in some way  equivalent to murder. But in what way, and to what lengths must one go in  order to avoid committing this sin? How many listeners are needed in order  to qualify as &quot;public&quot;? Three? Does the prohibition apply in  private too? Must one -- as certain passages of Torah seem to imply --  submit to martyrdom rather than disclose embarrassing information about  someone?<br />Feldman sorts handily through the range of rabbinic opinion,  carefully getting the issues clear and allowing the Tradition to offer its  answers. The result is not _easy_ reading by any means, but it will be  highly rewarding to anyone who wants a clear exposition of what Halakha  actually says.<br />And that means &quot;anyone,&quot; not only Halakhically  observant Jews. As Feldman himself is careful to note, his book is not  intended as a detailed guide to Jewish practice. It should therefore be of  tremendous interest to anyone who wants to learn about Jewish ethics.<br />In  particular, since in even the Reformest of Reform Judaism the _ethical_  mitzvot are still officially regarded as binding, there should be much in  this volume to provoke discussion and (it is hoped) agreement among the  various branches of modern Jewry.ould be much in  this volume to provoke discussion and (it is hoped) agreement among the  various branches of modern Jewry.	1999-12-17

The Talmud says that the very first question each of us will be asked when we are called to account is: &quot;Were you honest in business?&quot;<br />According to Judaism, prosperity, like happiness, is a  beneficent side effect of the pursuit of justice. Jewish business ethics  therefore call for the most scrupulous honesty and the most exacting  standards of fairness; one's purpose is not to &quot;die with the most  toys&quot; but to conduct one's affairs in a just manner.<br />Here Meir  Tamari (author of _The Challenge of Wealth_ and _With All Your  Possessions_) provides an informative sampling of excerpts from traditional  Jewish texts, interspersed with his own commentary, elaborating on thirteen  major types of &quot;business sin.&quot; (Since the editorial review above  provides an accurate and helpful summary of the book's contents, I don't  need to spell them out here.)<br />The resulting volume is helpful either for  those reflecting in preparation for Yom Kippur or for those looking for a  somewhat in-depth introduction to Jewish business ethics in the words of  the Tradition itself. (It should also make a nice companion to Tamari's  other works.) As such it should be of interest to anyone wanting to learn  more about a crucial area of Jewish ethics.<br />In particular, since even the  very Reformest of Reform Judaism still officially regards the _ethical_  mitzvot as binding, this volume should help to promote dialogue and  understanding on ground common to all branches of modern Jewry.	1999-12-14

Miss Manners, a.k.a. Judith Martin, is the cure for the more fundamental illness of which those feelings are symptomatic.<br />Young people do sometimes think they are being &quot;idealistic&quot; in holding that  there is something phony and delusive about etiquette. (One is tempted to  imagine them with battered and dog-eared copies of J.D. Salinger's _The  Catcher In The Rye_ stuffed into their back pockets.)<br />Unfortunately they  could not be more mistaken. Civility and politeness (which derive  respectively from the Latin and Greek words for &quot;society&quot;) are  absolutely necessary in order for human beings to live together with a  minimum of social friction; there is nothing whatsoever  &quot;idealistic&quot; about supposing we can dispense with them. On the  contrary, this supposition will probably, in practice, defeat every ideal  you hold.<br />Again, the best cure for this disease is to read Miss Manners  herself on the subject. Those who have not read her books may not realize  that in her hands, etiquette is _not_ a completely dreary affair involving  nothing but superficial mannerisms and polite phrases. But it will take  only a few pages for even the skeptical reader to realize that etiquette is  simply the conventional means by which we maintain, and convey, genuine  respect for one another as human beings.	1999-12-09

That's a shame, because every reader of Richard Dawkins's _The Blind Watchmaker_ ought to read this trenchant reply.<br />Ward  also takes on a few other thinkers (e.g. Peter Atkins) but most of his fire  is concentrated on Dawkins. Ward is pretty generous with Dawkins  (repeatedly, for example, complimenting him on his writing style) and is  certainly no enemy of evolutionary theory. But Ward rightly notes that  Dawkins pretty much hasn't got a clue what religion and religious  philosophy are about, seems to be hostile to both, and in fact provides  evidence himself that the emergence of life via evolutionary processes  should be seen as the result of intelligent design (to borrow a useful term  from William Dembski).<br />Warning: not _all_ of Ward's arguments are sound.  (At one point, for example, he argues that because there are so many more  possible _complex_ explanations than _simple_ ones, the probability of a  complex explanation far outweighs that of a simple one and therefore God is  a more probable explanation than anything simpler.

I really enjoy reading David Malet Armstrong's work.<br /><br />Not that I agree with him very often! But he is a wonderfully engaging  writer on philosophical topics. And in this volume he is recapping (and  building on) some two or three decades' worth of effort in the construction  of what he hopes is a plausible empiricist metaphysics.<br /><br />He expounds clearly  and lucidly on the sorts of things there ultimately are; whether there are  universals; the nature of causality and scientific law; what empiricists  should do with problematic entities like numbers and sets; the nature of  possibility and necessity, and what in the world an empiricist can mean by  either one; and any number of interesting side points -- always clearly,  always interestingly, and always ordered by Armstrong's tremendous  organizational skills.<br /><br />(The title of the book, by the way, expresses his  view that the universe consists of \\"states of affairs,\\" a state  of affairs being one of the following: (a) the possession of a property --  which he takes, I think correctly, to be a universal -- by what he calls a  \\"thin particular,\\" which is a sort of coat-hanger for properties;  or (b) the obtaining of a relation between/among two or more such  particulars.)<br /><br />Armstrong has one truly remarkable practice that makes it  easy for philosophical \\"opponents\\" like me to read and appreciate  his work: he is always careful to state what he calls his  \\"fall-back\\" positions, namely the positions to which he would  retreat if he found out his present views are false. His own example (from  the introduction to this volume): if he had to give up  \\"physicalism\\" with regard to the mind, he would be driven to  dualism rather than to materialism. (And amen to _that_.)<br /><br />As Armstrong  himself is clearly aware, this sort of approach is extremely helpful. It is  a most congenial style of exposition, of course, but it is also a fine way  to keep philosophical dialogue going between \\"opposing\\"  philosophical camps: a dualist has a sort of \\"second-order\\"  agreement with Armstrong, who is not actually a dualist right now but  _would_ be one _if_ . . .<br /><br />It seems almost irrelevant and even ungracious to  add that I don't actually have all that many first-order agreements with  him! I think, for example, that Armstrong is mistaken to regard all  relations between \\"states of affairs\\" as external relations; I  think he should have abandoned physicalism already; I think he has been  altogether too much influenced by Russell and Wittgenstein, especially as  regards \\"logical atomism\\"; I think his \\"thin  particular\\" itself consists of universals; I think \\"direct  realism\\" (with regard to perception) is attractive but ultimately  untenable; and I suspect that if he examined the presuppositions on which  his metaphysic is based, he would find himself committed to a much fuller  rationalism. And so on.<br /><br />But I confess Armstrong has made me think harder  about each of these points. He defends his theses about as well as they  could possibly be defended -- always, as I said, carefully stating his  \\"fall-back positions.\\" And his book is a workmanlike answer to  earlier critics of analytic philosophy who didn't think it was altogether  cricket for the young Turks to (try to) demolish speculative metaphysics  without providing any positive accounts of their own.<br /><br />Armstrong has written  a fine book here, and it will undoubtedly be a contribution of longstanding  importance to the analytic/empiricist literature. It can be read  profitably, and will be enjoyed, even by thinkers who disagree with it. I  offer myself as evidence in support of that contention.	1999-11-30

Here is Hofstadter himself on p. 709 of this very book: \\"My belief is that the explanations of 'emergent' phenomena in our  brains -- . . . [including] finally consciousness and free will -- are  based on a kind of Strange Loop, an interaction between levels in which the  top level reaches back down towards the bottom level and influences it,  while at the same time being determined by the bottom level. In other  words, a self-reinforcing 'resonance' between different levels . . . . The  self comes into being at the moment it has the power to reflect itself.  This should not be taken as an antireductionist position. It just implies  that a reductionistic explanation of a mind, _in order to be  comprehensible_ [Hofstadter's emphasis], must bring in 'soft' concepts such  as levels, mappings, and meanings. In principle, I have no doubt that a  totally reductionistic but incomprehensible explanation of the brain  exists; the problem is how to translate it into a language we ourselves can  fathom.\\"    In short, Hofstadter has indeed done exactly what I said he  did: speculated that consciousness and \\"selfhood\\" arise when a  system acquires sufficient power to represent itself.    And not because  anything causal happens at that \\"higher\\" level; on the contrary,  the \\"higher\\" level serves only the purpose of making a completely  reductionistic explanation \\"comprehensible\\" _to us_. Hofstadter  argues, then, that consciousness comes into being when a system becomes  sufficiently complex to represent itself.    (And yes, in strict consistency  he is committed to believing this condition sufficient to render _any_  system conscious; as my critic has helpfully noted, Hofstadter does indeed  argue that the \\"substrate\\" is irrelevant.)    Shortly before this  passage, Hofstadter has suggested that \\"Godel's theorem offers the  notion that a high-level view of a system may contain explanatorypower  which simply is absent on the lower levels\\" [p. 707]. And the  discussion immediately following this citation makes clear that Hofstadter  has in mind not what Godel's theorem _shows_, but the _method_ Godel used  to show it: the \\"Godel-numbering\\" technique by which the  \\"undecidable string\\" is generated.    In fact Godel's own  understanding of the theorem in question would have precluded Hofstadter's  speculation as cited above. Godel himself thought he had shown that  mathematical \\"objects\\" were _real_ in some Platonic sense, and  that the mind possesses a sort of mathematical intuition which is not  reducible to formal operations (and therefore the mind itself cannot be).    But, as I said, the _conclusion_ is not the aspect of Godel's theorem that  is of interest to Hofstadter. I continue to see a bit more than  \\"hand-waving\\" in this criticism. Again, though, Hofstadter's book  is brilliantly engaging on some of the very points noted by my critic.	1999-11-10

(James Allard and  Guy Stock have helpfully collected some of his central texts in _F.H.  Bradley: Writings on Logic and Metaphysics_, which makes a nice companion  to the present volume.)<br /><br />In it, Ferreira carefully examines and elaborates  Bradley's understanding of _judgment_, which Ferreira describes as  \\"_the_ basic act of cognition by which we knowingly encounter  reality.\\" The discussion turns to the relation between judgment and  truth, the relation between contradition and thought, the specially  Bradleian understanding of \\"coherence,\\" and (very importantly)  the relation between feeling and knowledge (which occupies two chapters).<br /><br />A  closing chapter considers criticisms of Bradley levelled by Russell and  James; a short conclusion argues briefly both that Bradley does not fit  easily into more recent philosophical categories, and that Bradley's  philosophy might provide a needed corrective to more recent views that we  either have no access to the real or that such access provides no insight  into universal _value_.<br /><br />An appendix delivers what seems to be a deathblow  to recent views of Bradley as an Anglo-empiricist by considering his  relations to what he regarded as the essentially empiricist view of  inference: associationism.<br /><br />For Bradley, says Ferreira, \\"the truth is  the whole.\\" It would perhaps not be unfair to regard this volume as an  attempt to spell out in some detail what this doctrine meant to Bradley and  to suggest that its meaning should be important to us today as well.<br /><br />For  those who, like me, have strong misgivings about the \\"analytic  turn\\" in philosophy, this fine exposition of Bradley's thought will be  most welcome.

You can click to  the next page if you want to read the rest of the review.<br />Here I'll add  that it's an important book for another reason: between the lines, it makes  a tremendous concession to non-Objectivist ethics.<br />In the opening essay,  on p. 24 of the current paperback edition, Rand acknowledges that there is  such a thing as &quot;socially objective value&quot; -- her term for what  Mises would have called _subjective_ value -- and says it is this kind of  value that the free market serves.<br />In the course of discussing this sort  of value, Rand concedes (with her teeth gritted) that the values  appropriate for what she called &quot;man _qua_ man_&quot; (and here  defines as &quot;man at his best&quot;) just aren't appropriate for  everybody.<br />If this insight were followed up consistently, the whole  Objectivist ethic would need to be revised from the ground up.

Enough centuries have passed that everyone should know this: If you want a clear and readable exposition of a difficult and complex subject, you ask a British philosopher.<br />In that grand tradition of solidity and soundness, A.C. Grayling here provides, without fanfare but with a good deal of  clarity and wit, a thoroughly reliable and lucidly intelligible  introduction to logic as this topic is understood within the broad spectrum  of analytic philosophy.<br />A standard textbook that is now in its third  edition (with extensive revisions and additions by the author), this volume  also makes for useful reading by interested laypersons (who may also know  Grayling as the author of two excellent volumes in the _Past Masters_  series, on Russell and Wittgenstein). It is highly recommended to anyone  seeking an accessible introduction to the field.<br />Grayling is also  recommended as a master of what Brand Blanshard memorably called  &quot;philosophical style.&quot; The oracular pronouncements of the world's  Nietzsches, Kierkegaards, Wittgensteins, and Ayn Rands usually get all the  attention, but what really keeps the enterprise of philosophy going is the  much-underappreciated art and skill of writing fine expository prose.

Books	4	41	44	N	N	Good intro to Swinburne	I understand why Swinburne closes this volume with some &quot;dissatisfaction,&quot; because it is a very brief distillation and summary of his much more detailed work elsewhere and it does, as he readily admits, invite any number of critical replies he does not have room to  address. Nevertheless this volume is a good introduction to his  thought.<br />Be warned: the God of Swinburne's &quot;natural theology&quot;  does not quite have all the attributes one expects in the God of  traditional theism. His God is not, for example, &quot;eternal&quot; (in  the sense &quot;outside of time altogether,&quot; though he is  &quot;everlasting&quot;), nor (therefore) does He have full foreknowledge  of what His creatures will do, nor is He sovereign over moral  law.<br />Swinburne's basic idea is that although no particular argument  clinches the case for God, several arguments together render His existence  altogether more likely than not. And, according to Swinburne, He provides  an explanation for scientific law in the sense that His existence explains  why there are such laws at all.<br />In this work, written as a popular reply  to Richard Dawkins and Stephen Hawking, Swinburne boils down his arguments  to the bare minimum and aims to present them readably to a popular  audience. He does it well, though the interested reader is referred to his  other work for details.<br />He is probably at his least convincing in dealing  with theodicy and the problem of evil. But other reviewers have already  commented on that, so I'll say no more about it here.<br />All in all, if you  are looking for an introduction to Swinburne's thought, this book is an  excellent choice.	1999-10-12

Armstrong has written a charmingly opinionated introduction to a topic that is very much alive despite its seeming neglect: the problem of universals. (&quot;Universals&quot; are repeatable features of reality. The &quot;problem&quot; is: are there any? And if not, why do we seem to think  there are?)<br />Armstrong has devoted a good deal of attention to this topic  already (see his earlier work), but in this slim volume he makes some  important additions and corrections to his previous views. It is a tribute  to his clarity and organizational skills that he manages to do so _while_  he is providing a highly readable introduction to this subject.<br />For it  _is_ highly readable; Armstrong has a gift for clear exposition, and his  presentations of all the relevant positions are accurate and eminently  fair. The reader may not agree with all of Armstrong's  &quot;opinionated&quot; conclusions (I don't), but I don't know of a better  introduction to the issues Armstrong is drawing those conclusions  _about_.<br />Another nice volume to place alongside this one is the  collection _Properties_, edited by D.H. Mellor (and also available through  Amazon). The two together are the equivalent of a thorough undergraduate-  or beginning-graduate-level course in the theory of universals.<br />For a  more general introduction, try Michael Loux's _Metaphysics_. And, for a  much-neglected attempted solution to the problem of universals, see Brand  Blanshard's _Reason And Analysis_.	1999-10-12

Here are a few at random (by no means an exhaustive list):<br />1. In epistemology, Rand regarded herself as having solved the &quot;problem of universals&quot; when, in fact, she  never raised it. Universals, if they exist, are repeatable features of  reality; _whether_ they exist is an irreducibly ontological question, not  (as Rand thinks) an epistemological one. Rand fancied herself to have found  a Third Way between nominalism and realism (&quot;Objectivism&quot;) solely  because she identified &quot;universals&quot; with concepts (and  abstractions) in the opening paragraphs of ITOE.<br />2. In ethics, Rand built  &quot;Objectivism&quot; on a foundation of pure _subjectivism_. Since her  ethic _presumes_ that one has made a positive &quot;choice to live,&quot;  Objectivism can give no guidance about whether to live or not, and all its  ethical injunctions rest on an arbitrary decision about which, strictly  speaking, Objectivism can give no guidance.<br />Moreover, having dispensed  with any ultimate, objective ethical standard, Rand tried to introduce one  anyway by insisting that anyone who did _not_ put the Objectivist ethic  into practice was quite literally subhuman, even subanimal. She arrives at  this insane view by (very much against her own epistemological standards)  identifying &quot;human&quot; with just _one_ attribute of human beings:  namely, rationality (understood in her own highly inadequate way). To see  how this view works out in practice, read pp. 1054-55 of ATLAS SHRUGGED,  where Dagny Taggart quite unnecessarily shoots a guard who has  &quot;proven&quot; himself to be less than an animal.<br />3. In politics,  Rand sapped all distinctive meaning from the moral concept of  &quot;rights&quot; by making respect for rights depend solely on  self-interest. That means that, in strict consistency, all Objectivism can  say about Hitler's atrocities is that it's a shame he loused up his _own_  life so badly.<br />Moreover, her claim that a government requires a legal  monopoly on the use of retaliatory force is a very foolish recipe for  totalitarianism. The entire federalist system (including the Second  Amendment) is supposed to _prevent_ just such a monopoly.<br />I could go on,  and sometimes I do ;-). But that will do for now.Hitler's atrocities is that it's a shame he loused up his _own_  life so badly.<br />Moreover, her claim that a government requires a legal  monopoly on the use of retaliatory force is a very foolish recipe for  totalitarianism.

Maybe  the anonymous reviewers just don't like getting spammed by angry  Objectivists; me, I collect that stuff. The really choice examples I post  to discussion lists so everybody can see them.<br />As for this volume itself,  it's a collection of rather embarrassing marginal notes from some books  that Rand attempted to read. Unfortunately she read them as though their  authors were using terms with the meanings _she_ assigned them, and  therefore often misunderstood them. (As I and other reviewers have noted,  her misreading of Ludwig von Mises' &quot;subjectivism&quot; is a very good  example.)<br />It _is_ possible to support this contention by argument and  example. But this review board isn't a discussion list; reviewers here post  fairly brief opinions, not lengthy, thoroughly argued essays. Objectivists  who expect otherwise, and then criticize only the _negative_ reviewers for  not giving all their reasons, are simply revealing their own  biases.<br />Intellectual cowardice, indeed. I think that charge applies  rather to Objectivists who respond only with insults when their guru is  criticized. But please, keep those insults coming; sooner or later,  _everyone_ will know just how centrally important reason and rationality  are to Rand's devoted followers.	1999-10-11

But I have to disagree with one of the other reviewers: reading Rand to learn about philosophy is like reading the New Testament to learn about Judaism.    Rand redefined quite a few terms and never let on -- perhaps because she  didn't know any better, and more likely because one of her major purposes  was to subvert traditional philosophy altogether.    The result is that she  not only misrepresents the thought of everyone else, but also makes it  almost impossible for her _readers_ to understand anyone else.    Everybody  knows the obvious examples: she left the words \\"exclusive or  excessive\\" out of her definition of \\"selfishness,\\" she  redefined \\"sacrifice\\" as the giving up of a _greater_ value for a  _lesser_ one, and what she meant by \\"altruism\\" has never been  defended by anyone important at all.    Less well known: she thought \\"a  priori,\\" \\"analytic,\\" and \\"necessary\\" were  synonyms, and likewise \\"a posteriori,\\" \\"synthetic,\\" and  \\"contingent\\" (no two terms in either triplet are synonymous); in  the very first line of her sole work on epistemology, she identified  \\"universals\\" with both \\"concepts\\" and  \\"abstractions\\" (again, no two of these terms are synonymous); and  she understood both \\"subjective\\" and \\"relative\\" to mean  \\"arbitrary\\" (which they don't, nor are they synonymous with each  other), leading her both to misunderstand Ludwig von Mises completely and  to coin the oxymoronic expression \\"contextually absolute.\\"    Even  the central term \\"objective\\" suffers at her hands; what most  people mean by \\"objective,\\" she calls \\"intrinsic.\\"    No  fields were immune from her anathematizing-by-misdefinition. She disposed  neatly of all versions of Idealism by defining \\"the primacy of  existence\\" in such a way as to preclude consciousness (and thereby  left her philosophy, just like Marx's and Lenin's, with the problem of  explaining how mind can be \\"produced\\" by unconscious matter). She  handily got rid of religion by representing God as the negation of  everything human -- blanking out on the fact that according to both Judaism  and Christianity, human rationality is itself the very image of the divine  and God is the _fulfillment_, not the negation, of human nature. Her  misrepresentations of Kant and Marx obscured the fact that she held  important doctrines in common with each. And in \\"Philosophical  Detection,\\" in this very volume, she incorrectly attributes the  saying, \\"Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds,\\" to  \\"a very little mind, Emerson\\" -- knowing full well that the  _correct_ version of the quote is, \\"A _foolish_ consistency is the  hobgoblin of little minds.\\"    (How do I know she knew better? I have an  acquaintance who worked with Rand when the piece was originally published.  The error was pointed out to her; she refused to correct it.)    But I can't  begin to detail all her oversights, inconsistencies, and misrepresentations  in one short review. Suffice it to say that this book is a good  introduction to her own thought, but not to anybody else's.    As for  \\"Philosophy,\\" one person \\"Who Needs It\\" is Rand  herself, and so will anybody who is foolish enough to read _only_ her  works. Read her, by all means -- but never forget that she was _primarily_  a propagandist.	1999-09-21

Douglas Hofstadter's imaginative and engaging GEB:EGB asks the question, &quot;Can machines be conscious?&quot; and answers in effect, &quot;Certainly, because we ourselves are such machines.&quot; And there is  no doubt that he earned his Pulitzer Prize for this fascinating book.<br />But  watch out! His reliance on imagination actually masks the real  problem.<br />The &quot;real problem&quot; is this: mind can't arise _simply_  from self-reference and self-representation, because reference and  representation presume the existence of a mind to begin with. Only minds  refer and represent; _resemblances_ (even fancy ones like  &quot;isomorphisms&quot;) aren't references/representations.<br />And in  Hofstadter's undeniably well-presented examples, his reliance on  imagination serves to distract from the absolutely crucial fact that the  reference and the representation are always provided by a mind _outside_  the system in question: the reader. A formal system complex enough to  &quot;represent itself&quot; doesn't become conscious; it takes a mind  _outside_ the system to &quot;see&quot; the isomorphisms in question as  references/representations. The system _itself_ can't do so unless mind is  _already_ there -- so Hofstadter's bootstrapping &quot;explanation&quot;  fails.<br />As an _argument_, then, GEB:EGB is a tremendous begging of the  question. Invoking Godel's Theorems and waving one's hands about  &quot;strange loops&quot; doesn't alter the fact that Godel's Theorem  itself delivers a killing blow to &quot;computational&quot; theories of  consciousness: semantics is _not_ reducible to syntax; truth is not  reducible to provability within a formal system; reason is not reducible to  purely formal logic; meaning is not reducible to isomorphism; and mind is  not reducible to computation. (And indeed, this reading has much more in  common with what Godel himself thought he had shown than does Hofstadter's  attempt to reinterpret Godel's work in favor of strong AI.)<br />But GEB:EGB  is still a remarkable intellectual accomplishment and a joy to read.

An excellent book on economics that should be of interest to all supporters of the free market, especially to Austrian-school economists and supporters of a Hayekian view of spontaneous order.<br /><br />I agree with the reader  from Northern Virginia who points out that Darwinism is not as well  established as Rothschild thinks; the reviewer in question is probably  thinking of e.g. Michael Behe's excellent _Darwin's Black Box_, which see.<br /><br />But that doesn't detract much from the ideas in _Bionomics_ -- in fact the  theory of natural selection was itself originally an importation of  economic ideas into biology. (And those ideas do have application there,  even if they don't explain _everything_. An economic account doesn't  explain _all_ of human society, either -- just some features of how it  works.)<br /><br />So think of this book as completing the circle: economics is at  last reclaiming its own ideas from biology. Rothschild is right that his  analogies with evolution aren't exact. But his book is actually a _better_  application of the ideas in question than is the theory of natural  selection.<br /><br />It makes good sense that the coordinated activities of  _purposeful_ beings should result in overall patterns that look purposeful  themselves -- much _better_ sense than that purposeful behavior _itself_  should ultimately result from fundamentally nonteleological activities.	1999-09-11

But the heart of Idealism is simply, as Bradley once put it, that  what satisfies the intellect is both true and real. In this sense, Idealism  is as old as Parmenides and need not commit one to the belief that reality  itself is basically mental (though Bradley himself thought so). What it  really requires is that there be no artificial divorce between the knowing  mind and the reality it is seeking to know: the real is ultimately  intelligible, and what is ultimately intelligible is real.<br />Bradley was a  seminal thinker in this tradition, and his insights are very often  duplicated by later thinkers who do not know how much ground he had already  broken. In this volume, key excerpts from all of Bradley's writings on  logic and metaphysics are assembled and introduced.<br />Also of interest to  readers of this volume will be the works of British Idealist Bernard  Bosanquet and American rationalist Brand Blanshard.

On the list of thinkers who have exemplified what Brand Blanshard called the &quot;rational temper,&quot; John Locke must surely place very high. The reader of this his most influential and important work will be  constantly struck not only by his sane and sober approach to philosophical  questions but indeed, as another reviewer has noted, by how commonplace his  own proposed solutions have become.<br />It will be found that Locke,  generally regarded as an &quot;empiricist,&quot; is extremely hard to  pigeonhole. Though rejecting (an earlier version of) the doctrine of  &quot;innate ideas&quot; and insisting that all of our ideas come from or  through sense-experience, he was clearly a &quot;rationalist&quot; as  regards the nature of knowledge itself. Both modern empiricists and modern  rationalists could benefit from a healthy infusion of his reasonable,  even-handed tenor and uncommon common sense.<br />Also highly recommended is  E.J. Lowe's _Locke On Human Understanding_, an excellent introduction and  overview to this great work as well as a delightful and highly insightful  attempt to show that many of Locke's positions are still defensible today  (though perhaps in need of some modification). It is a handy companion to  the present volume both for the beginner and for the longtime reader of  Locke; even those who know Locke well (or think they do!) will find Lowe's  work engaging and enlightening.	1999-08-02

Here philosopher Jonathan Lowe provides a fine and thorough introduction to Locke's greatest and most influential work: his  _Essay Concerning Human Understanding_.<br />Lowe not only provides clear and  sound explications of Locke's own views, carefully placing them into  historical context, but also inquires into whether Locke's views can be  defended today -- and, perhaps surprisingly, finds that many of them are  defensible though perhaps in need of modification. And Lowe does not  hesitate to add his own views where necessary, by way of suggesting how a  modern follower of Locke might carry his philosophy forward in light of  scientific developments since Locke's day.<br />The result is more than an  introduction to Locke -- it is a scintillating volume that will be a  pleasurable read even for longtime readers of Locke. Lowe has a knack for  picking out the most interesting features of Locke's thought and presenting  them in a new light.<br />For example, I was quite struck by Lowe's remarks on  Locke's &quot;particularist&quot; (Lowe's term) view of logic. Locke, as  his readers may know, was extremely critical of syllogistic formalism,  holding that while reasoned arguments may indeed be put in syllogistic  form, it was nevertheless ridiculous to maintain that the use of the form  itself is what gives validity to an argument. As Locke famously remarked,  God was not so sparing as to make men barely two-legged and leave it to  Aristotle to make them rational.<br />Lowe trenchantly notes that Locke's  critiques would apply equally well to the Frege-Russell variety of formal  logic; Locke, very much like Brand Blanshard in _Reason and Analysis_, held  that we reason by connecting terms through their _meanings_, which a  strictly formal logic provides no way to do.<br />Lowe's remarks on this point  are food for thought not only on the matter of formal logic but on the  question of what allegedly divides &quot;rationalism&quot; from  &quot;empiricism.&quot; Elsewhere in this volume, Lowe suggests that the  firm distinction between these allegedly opposite schools of thought cannot  be made out; and Locke was quite clearly a rationalist as regards knowledge  even if he believed we arrived at all of our our ideas  &quot;empirically.&quot; That is, Locke clearly still has something to say  to the rationalist philosophers of our own day -- and through Lowe, he says  it.<br />And says it well: it is very much to Lowe's credit that, through his  own lucid prose, he has allowed Locke to speak so clearly. The reader of  this excellent introduction will find Locke to be fine intellectual company  -- and also Lowe, a clear thinker and graceful writer whose own admiration  for Locke is never explicitly stated but is nevertheless obvious through  the keen sympathy of his presentation.<br />All in all, then, a delightful  volume very much in the Lockean spirit.question of what allegedly divides &quot;rationalism&quot; from  &quot;empiricism.&quot; Elsewhere in this volume, Lowe suggests that the  firm distinction between these allegedly opposite schools of thought cannot  be made out; and Locke was quite clearly a rationalist as regards knowledge  even if he believed we arrived at all of our our ideas  &quot;empirically.&quot; That is, Locke clearly still has something to say  to the rationalist philosophers of our own day -- and through Lowe, he says  it.<br />And says it well: it is very much to Lowe's credit that, through his  own lucid prose, he has allowed Locke to speak so clearly.

In this thirty-page essay, James J. Campbell makes mincemeat of the mainstream Objectivist view that an embryo is merely a &quot;potential&quot; human being, a &quot;piece of protoplasm&quot; that does not qualify as a living, fully individual human person and has no rights of its own. He directly challenges and refutes Ayn Rand's statements on the subject, and he especially targets the published views of Objectivist Andrew Bernstein.<br />In all cases he replaces evasion and distortion with reason and biological fact, carefully restoring the concept of _development_ to a topic in which the overall biological context is too often dropped. An embryo is not a mere &quot;potentiality,&quot; he argues, but an actual, existing human being, albeit one at an early stage of biological development. It is not a &quot;parasite&quot; in any biologically meaningful sense of the word. And it is an individual from the very moment of conception.<br />When he is through, he has successfully made his case that abortion, in the case of a healthy adult female who became pregnant through voluntary sexual relations, is not a moral &quot;right&quot; but an objectively immoral act -- in Campbell's own phrase, a &quot;grotesque evil.&quot;<br />He allows for the possibility that in other cases, abortion _may_ be moral. Unfortunately he says so little about such cases that his views are hard to evaluate. (And some of what he says is therefore unconvincing. He seems to maintain, e.g., that for a woman who is herself not a fully developed, rational adult, abortion may be morally justified merely by her own need for &quot;rationality&quot; and the correspondingly greater impact a child would have on her own development. But these considerations would not justify other forms of murder -- and in order for them to count here, Campbell would have to show that abortion is something less than full-blown murder.)<br />He also says nothing about what some would regard as a crucial issue: What, if anything, should the \\"law of the State\\" do about any of this? He also does not address a closely related moral issue: what, if anything, is it morally proper for an otherwise uninvolved bystander to do? In general, he is silent on the morality/legality of prevention and/or punishment. (Though, given his topic, his decision to limit himself to the primary ethical issue may have been a wise one.)<br /> Nor does he discuss the difference between ejecting an embryo from one's womb, on the one hand, and positively killing it, on the other. Pro-abortionists tend to write as though abortion really amounts to the former, but as abortion is actually practiced it is unquestionably the latter.<br />Still, one can't accomplish everything in namely, to demonstrate that on an issue of tremendous importance, Objectivism has misapplied its own fundamental principles.<br />For some of the issues Campbell does not tackle, interested readers are referred to Libertarians For Lifehing, should the \\"law of the State\\" do about any of this?

Nobody has ever managed to find the mysterious dictionary that supposedly misled Ayn Rand about the standard meaning of &quot;selfishness.&quot; Nor, to my knowledge, has anyone been able to reconcile this volume's essay  opposing the &quot;argument from intimidation&quot; with Rand's own opening  statement that she is using the term &quot;selfishness&quot; &quot;for the  reason that makes you afraid of it.&quot;<br />In fact what she is reclaiming  in this volume is the morality of rational self-interest, which is far from  &quot;selfishness&quot; as ordinarily understood (and as defined in  everyone's dictionary but Rand's).<br />But she does a damn fine job of this  reclamation. I call particular attention to a neglected essay: &quot;The  'Conflicts' of Men's Interests.&quot; The thesis of this essay is that  there are no ultimate conflicts of legitimate interest among rational  people, and this thesis really should be more central to Objectivist ethics  than it has been to date. It is crucial to Rand's entire concept of  &quot;selfishness&quot; that not only does one's self-interest not require  the sacrifice of others' interests, but indeed it is positively served  through the promotion of others' well-being. (In fact I'd recommend reading  this essay in conjunction with &quot;Causality vs. Duty&quot; in  _Philosophy: Who Needs It_.)<br />As I've suggested in a review that has now  scrolled off the page, &quot;The Objectivist Ethics&quot; really could  stand a good deal more emphasis on the virtue of benevolence and the  rational propriety of directly seeking the good of people other than  oneself. But fundamentally, all that is needed here is a straightforward  recognition that human beings are social by nature and that the pursuit of  eudaimonia is not a zero-sum game. So when Rand writes &quot;man's life qua  man,&quot; read &quot;other people&quot; as included in such a life and you  won't go astray.<br />And if you read this book, do read _Capitalism: TheUnknown Ideal_ as well. The two volumes belong together, and in my own view  the latter is a better book.	1999-04-22

I would add the  following: Walker is pretty good on the topic of the Objectivist movement's  cultic features, but this book will not give you much of a clue about what  anyone finds attractive about Rand's philosophy to begin with. Not all of  her supporters are cultists (or even &quot;neo-Objectivists&quot;), and  Walker doesn't go very far toward explaining her broader appeal to people  who _do_ think for themselves. (Strictly speaking, of course, that was not  his purpose in writing this book. But it would have allowed him to make  many of his points by contrast.)<br />I will, however, give Walker lots of  points for here and there raising legitimate _questions_ about the content  of that philosophy even though that was not his primary aim. And as I and  other reviewers have noted: whatever the book's editorial shortcomings,  Walker's closing chapter, a fictional biographical sketch of Ayn Rand as  she might have been, is excellent. The contrast with her actual behavior  will be obvious to anyone who reads the rest of the book.	1999-03-25

If you're looking for an introduction to libertarian thought, this is THE book to read.<br /><br />Here, free-market economist and radical for liberty Murray Newton Rothbard tackles all the major issues: the philosophical basis of  libertarianism, the history of classical liberalism, the failures of  government to preserve basic liberties, and the ways in which a free-market  economy handily solves problems that seem forever beyond the reach of  government.<br /><br />Rothbard is also one of few libertarians to face the issue of  pollution head-on. You'll search Ayn Rand's works in vain for any  \\"pollution solution\\"; she was apparently content to believe the  problem didn't really exist, a practice to some extent continued by her  disciple George Reisman in his mostly brilliant treatise _Capitalism_. But  Rothbard doesn't duck the issue: demonstrable pollution is an invasion of  property rights and should be outlawed.<br /><br />Nor is Rothbard a friend of  \\"corporate capitalism.\\" Again unlike Rand, who regarded \\"big  business\\" as \\"America's most persecuted minority,\\" Rothbard  lambastes big business for its constant seeking of government favors and  its use of clout to secure protectionist legislation -- including  \\"limited liability.\\"<br /><br />All in all, this book is a treat.

Mises's plan here is to place the science of  economics on a firm axiomatic foundation. In particular, his aim is to  derive economic theory from the axiom that (my paraphrase) human beings act  to achieve ends under conditions of scarcity in a world in which finite and  delimitable causes have finite and delimitable effects.<br />Two other major  treatises will be of interest to readers of this work: Murray Rothbard's  _Man, Economy and State_, and George Reisman's _Capitalism: A Treatise on  Economics_.<br />I also agree with the other reviewer who suggests reading  Carl Menger's _Principles of Economics_. Mises describes that work as the  book that made an economist of him, and it's a much quicker read than any  of the three major treatises I've named.<br />Also of great interest: Mises's  _The Theory of Money and Credit_, described by Murray Rothbard as the best  book on money ever written.

In what is probably her best work of nonfiction, Ayn Rand sets out to provide a _moral_ basis for capitalism, a social/political order in which the human rights to life and property are respected and there are no  (other) limitations on freedom of trade. That capitalism is today to some  degree a _known_ ideal is in some measure due to the influence of Rand's  ideas as represented in this volume.<br />One of this book's great strengths  is its inclusion of helpful essays by Nathaniel Branden, Robert Hessen, and  Alan Greenspan. This is the _only_ volume of nonfiction published during  her lifetime to include essays by anyone other than herself and Branden. It  is also the only such book to include a bibliography of recommended  reading. (Non-Objectivist works are listed with a caveat that the ideas  contained therein may not be fully consonant with Rand's.)<br />And they are  more than helpful: their presence suggests _why_ this volume represents  Rand's best work. That she was willing and able to include essays by, and  references to, other writers surely indicates that she was confident enough  in her own views to acknowledge her need for supplementation outside her  own areas of strength.<br />In my own view, Rand was a first-rate political  thinker, a pretty good ethicist, a lousy epistemologist, and not a  metaphysician at all to speak of. (In the latter three fields, she would  have profited from closer attention to the writings of Brand Blanshard,  whom she respected highly despite some disagreements. _The Letters of Ayn  Rand_ indicates that he sent her a signed copy of _Reason And Goodness_  when it was published.) Her philosophy is at heart an attempt to ground her  defense of capitalism in ethics, epistemology, and metaphysics, and it  becomes gradually less successful the further she wanders from her  strengths.<br />But in political theory, she was on firm ground -- and she  knew it. And in this collection of essays she is at her best, arguing that  theonly proper function of government is the protection of individual  rights, that individual rights are the only kind there are, that apparent  failures of the free market are actually failures of the _government_ to  restrict itself to its proper role, and generally, that capitalism is the  only economic system fully consonant with man's nature as a value-seeking  agent who survives and thrives through the application of reason to  reality.<br />So if you plan to read one nonfiction work by Rand, this is the  one to read. If she sparks your interest, then go on to read the flawed but  helpful _Philosophy: Who Needs It_ and _The Virtue Of Selfishness_.<br />Then  stop, unless you're just morbidly curious. Her works in epistemology and  aesthetics do not measure up to the standards set in these collections and  are of interest largely for the chroniclers of the bizarre personality cult  that grew up around her. To find out about _that_, read Jeff Walker's  idiosyncratic but interesting _The Ayn Rand Cult_.	1999-02-26

Her presentation is indeed flawed; as one  reviewer notes, she doesn't make sufficient allowance for human beings to  be directly motivated by concern for one another. But making the  adjustments necessary to include benevolence doesn't alter the overall  ethical outlook much; it just allows the good of other people to be a value  legitimately sought for its own sake by rational agents. The standard of  value is still &quot;life,&quot; and the contention that there are no  conflicts of interest among fully rational people still stands.<br />So it  needs a little work, and I'm not entirely persuaded that the result should  still be called &quot;egoism&quot; (I personally prefer the term  &quot;rational eudaimonism&quot;). But remember the book's subtitle: Rand  was trying to offer a _new_ concept of egoism. Both her supporters and her  detractors need to keep this fact in mind, or they will charge her with  having said things she didn't.<br />She does not, as one reviewer says,  &quot;leav[e] no room for argument&quot; or &quot;achieve . . . absolute  certainty with no contradiction.&quot; But that means merely that one must  read her critically and carefully, just as one would any other author. So  ignore the inflated claims of her most ardent &quot;followers&quot; and  think for yourself; her die-hard supporters are not worried that you'll  catch _her_ in a mistake, but merely that you'll find out that _they've_  wasted their lives serving as dogmatic, &quot;individualistic&quot;  mouthpieces for an imperfect spokesperson.<br />Readers should also dig out a  copy of Brand Blanshard's _Reason And Goodness_, which may be the single  best volume ever written on ethics. (Or see the section on  &quot;ethics&quot; in _The Philosophy Of Brand Blanshard_.) Blanshard's  ethical thought presents a much sounder overview of the issues involved,  and his clear-sighted &quot;rational temper&quot; makes a nice contrast to  Rand's rather badgering tone.	1999-02-25

So why do I give it only a single star?<br />Because this compendium also includes selections from the writings  of Leonard Peikoff -- and of no one else. In particular, Nathaniel  Branden's writings -- never officially disavowed by the  &quot;Objectivist&quot; movement -- have disappeared down the memory hole.  FLUSSSSSSSSSH. You'd never know he existed, let alone exercised any major  influence on Rand, even though his essays are still reprinted in every copy  of _The Virtue of Selfishness_ and _Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal_. (And  what happened to all those back issues of _The Objectivist Newsletter_ that  Ayn Rand personally approved for publication? Have Branden's articles been  snipped out of them too?)<br />Thankfully, however, Harry Binswanger has  excluded the writings of such ARI nonentities as Peter Schwartz. And if he  had similarly excluded Peikoff's second-rate stuff, I'd have rated the  results more highly.<br />Mercy, I'd have given it two stars if he'd just been  honest enough to entitle it _The Ayn Rand and Leonard Peikoff Lexicon_.	1999-02-12

It is not,  and he himself recommends (in the book's equally lucid preface) that it be  read in conjunction with -- _not_ as a replacement for -- a more  conventional translation.<br />Like Mitchell's _Tao Te Ching_, this work is an  interpretive rendering -- or, as its subtitle indicates, a &quot;modern  reading.&quot; And a very good one it is; Rabbi Shapiro is one of today's  most responsible and insightful liberal-Jewish commentators on traditional  Jewish texts.<br />But _do not_ mistake this work for a  &quot;translation.&quot; If you're looking for one, try Rabbi Jacob  Neusner's _Torah From Our Sages_.	1999-02-12

Grounding his arguments in a rational-egoistic,  natural-law-based &quot;virtue ethic,&quot; he presents what may be the  best argument yet offered that the virtue of generosity is a constitutive  part of a well-lived human life. He then proceeds to demolish the view that  generosity may properly, or can be effectively, enforced by a &quot;welfare  state.&quot;<br />This work also makes a nice companion to David Kelley's  _Unrugged Individualism_, which focuses on the more general virtue of  _benevolence_. The Randian camp has not yet made a full case that  benevolence and generosity -- which, by nature and definition, aim  _directly_ at the well-being of people other than oneself -- are genuinely  compatible with rational egoism; Kelley in particular tries to reduce  benevolence without remainder merely to further consequences to oneself.  But Machan's virtue ethic makes up for a good deal of what Kelley lacks;  between the two of them, they've made a tremendous start on a very  demanding project.	1999-02-04

Goldberg's journalistic survey of Jewish influence in American politics is an even-handed, fair-minded summary of some twenty-five years of public involvement on the part of American Jews.<br />However, Goldberg's  conclusion -- that American Jews should align themselves with other  coalitions on the liberal left in order to increase their combined  influence -- is unfortunate. In fact what his survey demonstrates is that  theologically liberal Judaism in the U.S. has dangerously allied itself  with the growth of statism in the alleged name of compassion.<br />Goldberg's  survey pays little attention to politically conservative forces within  American Jewry, and with perhaps some justification given the purpose of  this book: by far the vast majority of theologically liberal Jews in the  U.S. are politically &quot;liberal&quot; as well. But it is too bad that  Goldberg does not follow up on one of his own most telling insights: that  leftist political affiliation among Jews cannot be entirely due to the  influence of Jewish tradition, because more traditionally-minded Jews also  tend to be more politically conservative. (And for good reason; Jewish  tradition is far less trusting of State power than many liberal Jews seem  to be aware.)<br />For a more rounded view, read this book in conjunction  with, say, David Horowitz's _The Politics of Bad Faith_. Then follow up on  Horowitz's own sources and look into the economics of the free market --  beginning with the works of Ludwig von Mises, whom Horowitz cites  favorably, and passing on to other works by e.g. Murray Rothbard and Israel  Kirzner.<br />Goldberg's historical survey of liberal Judaism's attachment to  liberal politics is enlightening and informative, but his advice to the  political left is a recipe for bad government. It is perhaps too much to  expect a journalistic survey to be ordered and informed by sound economic  and political principles, but such principles are required if the true  importance of this book is to be appreciated.

Certainly decent people will do so, and Singer here presents a wide array of cases in which we could do more in this regard (which is why he gets two  stars instead of just one).<br />But: do animals have &quot;rights&quot;? No,  they do not.<br />_Rights_ belong only to beings capable of exercising virtue  or engaging in ethical behavior. Human beings are the only creatures  currently known to be capable of rational reflection on our own actions --  which is why Singer wrote his book specifically for human beings to read,  and why, when the treatment of animals is at issue, it is human beings who  must do all the hard work of decisionmaking.<br />Singer's  &quot;utilitarian&quot; approach obscures this fundamental point. Animals  cannot be &quot;liberated&quot; for the simple reason that they cannot be  &quot;free&quot; in the same sense as human beings. _At most_, we may say  that because our actions can and do cause pain to animals, we should _take  their pain into account_ in making our own decisions.<br />In that sense we  may say that, by our _own_ (human) ethical standards of benevolence and  generosity, animals have a claim on our attention. What we may _not_ say is  that &quot;their&quot; claim (which is really _our_ claim on their behalf)  overrides human concerns, or should even count equally to those  concerns.<br />Call me &quot;species-ist&quot; if you must.

The result, which he  calls the Principle of Generic Consistency, is a moral requirement to act  in such a way as to take into account the &quot;generic rights&quot; of all  who are affected by our actions, these &quot;generic rights&quot; including  _both_ libertarian negative rights against interference _and_ positive  rights to certain essentials required for well-being.<br />Gewirth tries to  steer a middle course between the extremes of &quot;libertarianism&quot;  and &quot;socialism,&quot; and as a libertarian myself I must say that he  is not always successful; my own opinion is that his strictly political  discussion (on e.g. the legitimacy of taxation and the &quot;supportive  state&quot;) fails to make some crucially important distinctions. But his  _moral_ arguments are generally quite compelling all the same. And I  heartily endorse, at least in spirit, his account of the &quot;duty to  rescue&quot; on which some of his political conclusions are based: under  certain circumstances, if one can help to &quot;rescue&quot; someone else  whose life is at risk, with no &quot;comparable cost&quot; to oneself, then  one is morally obliged to do so. (In my own view, this is so obviously  rational that I wouldn't even bother calling it a &quot;duty&quot;; surely  it is what any sane and benevolent person would do. Which, really, is  Gewirth's point, although he makes it deontologically rather than  teleologically.)<br />In short, this work on ethical rationalism is well worth  reading even for those who, like me, may disagree with some of Gewirth's  strictly political conclusions. And even those conclusions fare well enough  if we may take the liberty(!) of allowing nongovernmental social  institutions to fulfill the undoubtedly legitimate functions Gewirth  unnecessarily assigns to the &quot;state.&quot;assigns to the &quot;state.&quot;	1999-02-01

His concern here is to present this degree of understanding as an _ideal_,  as the final goal at which thought implicitly aims to the extent that it  deserves to be called thought at all. And his account of this implicit  ideal throws its light on the development of human cognition from its very  beginnings, just as knowledge of an oak throws light upon the nature of an  acorn.<br />Blanshard was the most empirical of rationalists, having been  driven to his rationalist position by a close examination of the realities  of human thought; this work is the fruit of that examination. And because  he stays close both to philosophy and to human psychology, his work can be  profitably read by those in either camp.<br />And it should be read. Great  philosophical treatises are all too seldom written, and this is one of the  twentieth century's greatest. Nothing since has matched it in either scope  or rigor.	1999-01-21

Though himself a rationalist, Blanshard was  not under the illusion that only avowed rationalists could be reasonable,  as his selection of examples clearly shows. In each essay, he presents a  lucid and sympathetic account of his subject's life and thought in a  seamless combination that deserves to be called &quot;philosophical  biography.&quot;<br />While this volume is of course highly informative about  each of its four subjects, it also of interest as regards Blanshard's own  thought. He was ninety-two years old when he wrote this delightful and  highly readable work, and his examinations of these four men distill a  lifetime of his own reflections on the role of reason in the ordering of  human affairs. A final chapter -- &quot;The enemy: Prejudice&quot; --  summarizes his mature views on the nature and importance of the rational  temper.<br />The entry under Blanshard's name in the _Oxford Companion to  Philosophy_ closes on an uncharacteristically personal note:  &quot;Blanshard's personal demeanour,&quot; writes the entry's author Prof.  Peter H. Hare, &quot;was one of extraordinary graciousness.&quot; That  graciousness, evident throughout his work, is especially so here, where  Blanshard deals less directly with philosophical questions and more  directly with reasonableness as instantiated in actual human lives; his  generosity and sympathy (much neglected rational virtues!) are almost  palpable.

Those who are  impressed by the bold pronouncements of Nietzsche, Kierkegaard and  Wittgenstein will find little solace here, but anyone who expects  philosophers actually to love wisdom will be delighted to encounter a  kindred spirit.

There is  some of each in here -- including her trademark attacks on Immanuel Kant,  whom she regarded (quite unjustly) as the most evil human being who had  ever lived and even as ultimately responsible for the rise of Nazism.    She  continues these absurd attacks here in her essay \\"Kant vs.  Sullivan,\\" which, like all her other critiques of Kant, were based not  on firsthand knowledge of anything Kant ever wrote but on other writers'  books _about_ Kant.    But there is also, in such somewhat uncharacteristic  essays as \\"Causality vs. Duty,\\" a hint of an occasionally underlying precision of thought that led Nathaniel Branden to describe her, after his  first meeting with her, as \\"Mrs. Logic.\\"    And her introductory  essay, for which the book is named, is one of the best and clearest  arguments around for the importance of philosophy even (especially!) to  those who think they _don't_ need it.    There are also some other treats  here. There is, for example \\"The Stimulus and the Response,\\" her  critique of B.F. Skinner's \\"behaviorism\\" and the favorable  critical response it engendered from sources who ought to have known  better. There are \\"What Can One Do?\\" and \\"Don't Let It  Go,\\" two fairly successful attempts to urge her readership to rely on  the power of _ideas_ in protection of the American ideal of liberty. And  there is \\"An Open Letter to Boris Spassky,\\" an extended metaphor  in which the clearly defined, rational universe of the chessboard is taken  as a microcosm of the real world, in order to demonstrate vividly the  rationality required in life generally (and politics specifically).    These  essays are not _quite_ enough to earn Rand the title of \\"The Voice of  Reason\\" (another posthumously-publishedcollection of essays that Rand  did _not_ edit and to which the present collection is far superior). But  Rand undoubtedly deserves to be credited among reason's \\"backing  vocalists\\" even if her own shrill voice did not quite deserve the  spotlight.    To hear the genuine \\"voice of reason,\\" one should turn  to the writings of philosopher Brand Blanshard, whose prose style and  character represented a seamless fusion of style and substance in the  service of the \\"great grey virtue,\\" reasonableness. But though  Rand herself found it impossible to exemplify the \\"rational  temper,\\" still in at least some of the essays here collected, she  comes as close to it as she ever did.	1999-01-13

All the familiar details are here: Rand's megalomaniacal rationalizations of her own whims  and tastes, her shameful treatment of personal friends and acquaintances,  her affair with Nathaniel Branden and the subsequent schism in the  Objectivist movement, her refusal to retract her public statements  endorsing smoking even as she was dying of lung cancer, the ousting of  &quot;heretics&quot; from the &quot;orthodox&quot; Objectivism currently  defended by Leonard Peikoff and the second-rate hangers-on at the Ayn Rand  Institute.<br />But be careful to take it with several grains of salt; Walker  sometimes goes over the top in his personal opinions, without always  identifying them as such. (One egregious example: in his chapter on  Nathaniel Branden, he as much as blames Branden for causing the death of  Branden's second wife Patrecia, who died tragically owing to a failure to  take her epilepsy medication. Walker's grounds for this horrible accusation  consist of nothing more than his own assertions about what Branden  &quot;should have known.&quot;)<br />This book leaves the impression that it  was patched together without much attention to detail; for example, here  and there, out of the blue, we are given a quote from &quot;Smith&quot;  with no indication _which_ of the book's three major Smiths (Kay Nolte  Smith, Phil Smith, and George H. Smith) is being quoted. (This information  is available in the book's endnotes, but its absence in the text seems to  indicate that the book was pieced together from shorter snatches with no  eye toward continuity.) Numerous interviewees are &quot;introduced&quot;  more than once (sometimes only a few pages apart), and several stories are  repeated needlessly. There is no doubt that the phenomenon Walker is trying  to document was and is quite real, but this would have been a better book  if he had taken the trouble to edit it more thoroughly (including editing  _out_ some of his own opinions).<br />Kudos to Walker, though, for the work's  final section: a fictional &quot;biographical sketch&quot; of an Ayn Rand  that could have been. As Walker effectively shows through his imaginative  reconstruction, had Rand been a little less paranoid and a little more  willing to seek professional help for her depression and other  psychological disorders, her personal life and influence might well have  measured up more closely to her public persona.e trouble to edit it more thoroughly (including editing  _out_ some of his own opinions).<br />Kudos to Walker, though, for the work's  final section: a fictional &quot;biographical sketch&quot; of an Ayn Rand  that could have been.

Searle condenses a lifetime-to-date of thought on various issues surrounding the so-called \\"mind-body\\" problem.<br /><br />The solution to this problem, he  contends, is to regard mind as a natural phenomenon that depends causally  on the brain but also has causal powers of its own (much like such  macro-properties of matter as \\"solidity\\" and \\"color\\").  In this way, he argues, we can do justice to the empirical facts without  falling into either of the twin errors \\"dualism\\" and  \\"materialism,\\" both of which he ascribes to an inherited  philosophical language that is frankly better dispensed with.<br /><br />He summarizes  his views on consciousness and \\"intentionality,\\" quickly but  precisely describing the essential features of mental activity that set it  apart from other natural phenomena.<br /><br />On this foundation, he builds his  theories of speech acts and socially-constructed reality, never losing  sight of the fact that each of these depends on a \\"background\\" of  what he calls \\"external realism\\" (the view that there is a given  reality that exists independently of our minds, which he correctly notes is  not really a \\"view\\" but the implicit basis on which _all_  \\"views\\" are held).<br /><br />And there are other delights along the way:  for example, we are also treated, in summary fashion, to Searle's  engagingly straightforward defense of the aforementioned \\"external  realism\\" (presented more fully in the three closing chapters of his  previous work, _The Construction of Social Reality_).<br /><br />All in all, this  highly readable, entertaining, and thought-provoking volume by an eminent  modern philosopher succeeds in its aim of restoring, and even somewhat  advancing, the ideals of the Enlightenment against a modern/postmodern  onslaught of obfuscatory antirealism. It should lead satisfied readers to  investigate the rest of his works, to which this volume is a valuable  introduction and which they will find equally brilliant: Searle does  philosophy as it ought to be done.e does  philosophy as it ought to be done.	1999-01-08

What's next? _Ayn Rand's Laundry Lists_?<br /><br />After her early fiction, her journals and her letters were published, one would have thought the vein of publishable Randian material had been tapped out. But no -- now we're  treated to a volume of her _marginal notes_ in books written by _other_  people.<br /><br />Really, why is this stuff being published? Her comments on Ludwig  von Mises' _Human Action_ are strictly inept; she never managed to grasp  what he meant by \\"subjectivism,\\" and it's just not all that  edifying to watch her call him names (\\"The damn  _whim-worshipper_!\\"). And most of the other works included here are  just not all that important.<br /><br />Nor did Rand ever intend these trivial  scribbles for publication. Yet despite warnings in _the book itself_ that  these little marginal scrawls don't represent Rand's final and considered  views on much of anything, I've actually seen Randroids hail her allegedly  masterly \\"deconstruction\\" of Misesian subjectivism as though her  nasty notes to herself on the matter actually constituted a responsible  opinion.<br /><br />Somebody needs to get a life.	1998-12-28

Peikoff's essays aren't  terrible, but his placing them next to Rand's simply makes obvious what a  pretentious and derivative thinker he really is. And Schwartz's  ill-considered ravings against \\"Libertarianism: The Perversion of  Liberty\\" (particularly his attacks on the late great Murray Rothbard,  compared to whom Schwartz is a gnat), far from meriting description as the  \\"voice of reason,\\" do not deserve to be published here or  anywhere else.<br /><br />Buy this book for Rand's essays, but read around the extras  thrown in by a couple of mediocre hangers-on.	1998-12-27

But his thought lives on in this posthumous collection, mostly drawn from his monthly essays for _The Free  Market_ between 1982 and 1995.<br /><br />These essays cover a wide range of topics,  from the welfare state to Clintonomics to fiat money to U.S. intervention  in the Middle East -- and Rothbard is uniformly sharp, clear, incisive, and  witty wherever he turns his pen.<br /><br />This collection should also be of interest  to those of Rothbard's readers who have heard that he somehow changed his  views near the end of his life; the fact is that Rothbard was as strongly  laissez-faire and libertarian in his later years as he had ever been.<br /><br />Some  of his readers had simply failed to recognize that the earlier Rothbard was  not at all \\"libertine\\" but socially quite conservative; they were  therefore surprised that he found anything good to say about Pat Buchanan  (as he does here, several times) or against allowing illegal aliens to have  access to the vast machinery of the welfare state (as in a passage  regarding California's Prop. 187 in the book's final essay, a previously  unpublished commentary on the November 1994 elections).<br /><br />As the essays in  this volume make clear, it was those readers, not Rothbard, who were guilty  of inconsistency. Rothbard was uncompromisingly and consistently devoted to  liberty throughout his entire career; he simply did not, as some of his  readers have done, confuse antifederalism with moral nihilism.<br /><br />Also, the  penultimate essay provides an overview of the history of the Ludwig von  Mises Institute (Auburn, AL), of which Rothbard was Academic  Vice President until his death. By the time readers reach this essay, they  will be unsurprised that, when Austrian economics sprang again to life in  the 1980s and 1990s, it was wearing a rumpled jacket and a bow tie.	1998-12-27

But his positive account of reason is as fresh and  important now as then.<br /><br />In a nutshell, Blanshard's view is that reason is  the power of grasping necessary connections; that the universe itself is a  coherent logical and causal whole, shot through with threads of necessity  and in which every specific \\"fact\\" is entailed by every other if  we could but see it fully; that to understand something is to see it in the  context of its necessary relations to that whole; and that this whole  operates causally on our minds to lead us to truth through logic.<br /><br />(It is  this last point that prevents his determinism from being futile and  self-undermining: to be determined by reason is, for Blanshard as for  Spinoza, what the rational man means by freedom.)<br /><br />This work also bristles  with important insights about the limits of formal logic and offers a  theory of universals that has not, to my knowledge, received the attention  it deserves. It is, in short, a must-read for any serious student of  philosophy.	1998-12-27

It was no such thing; its purpose, as expressly  stated in Torah, was the prevention of grinding poverty among Israelites.<br /><br />Judaism did not then, and does not now, place any _upper_ limit on the  accumulation of wealth by honest means. The Jubilee was a specific solution  to a specific problem: the extremely limited supply of land in an ancient  agrarian society whose national borders had been set, as it was thought, by  God. In effect, it limited land transfers to _rental contracts_ for  specified periods; prices were calculated accordingly, and (in today's  language) no one's property rights were violated. There is no basis for  regarding the Jubilee as a \\"redistribution\\" scheme, and none for  extending its provisions to goods that are not in similarly limited supply.<br /><br />Rabbi Waskow's other discussions of Judaism and economics are similarly  divorced from any responsible understanding of either. Anyone interested in  either topic is advised to look elsewhere.	1998-11-15

Professor Reisman's treatise offers a thorough understanding of capitalism, a  synthesis of Austrian and classical economics bristling with new insights  into the bargain, and refutations of the major opposing camps. (The chapter  on the \\"environmentalism\\" may be the only writing on this  subject, other than Ayn Rand's own, clearly to identify the anti-human  motivations of the \\"green\\" movement.)<br /><br />My only misgiving is that  Reisman's introduction, footnotes and bibliography continue the Objectivist  tradition of unfairly criticizing Murray Rothbard.<br /><br />Neither Rand nor her  followers have ever come thoroughly to grips with the claims of  anarchocapitalism that defense and court services can be provided by the  market without a central government; nor have they adequately faced the  difficulties (if not actual contradictions) inherent in the creation of a  State from scratch without violating anyone's rights in the process; nor do  they ever seem to have grasped why Rothbard describes many of the actions  of the U.S. government in the twentieth century as  \\"imperialistic.\\" There is thus a little hubris in dismissing  Rothbard's work as egregiously self-contradictory.<br /><br />(And who ever said -- as  Reisman implies in his bibliography -- that Rothbard's  _Man, Economy and  State_ should be read as a \\"substitute\\" for Ludwig von Mises's  _Human Action_?)<br /><br />Reisman does not accept Mises's neo-Kantian and ethically  subjectivist foundations (as Rothbard also did not), yet he recommends that  students of economics read _all_ of Mises's works. Would that he showed the  same generosity toward another of Mises' most brilliant students.<br /><br />But these  are small issues that do not affect the main thrust of Reisman's  presentation.

For example, he  consistently treats the virtue of \\"rationality\\" as a sort of  intrinsic value of its own quite apart from its role in the achievement of  values, and indiscriminately classes all kinds of irrationality together as  equally evil in the blackest way; and generally speaking, he tends to  divorce virtue from its place in successful living and treat it as a  deontological floating abstraction. Granted that Rand at her worst  sometimes showed the same tendencies, Rand at her best knew better. Peikoff  apparently does not.    That said, however, it is almost unthinkable that a  longtime associate of Ayn Rand could write such a book without saying  _anything_ helpful about Objectivism.    And Peikoff does not thoroughly  disappoint: though in many ways untrue to Rand's spirit, he does have a  fairly sound grasp of the logical structure of Objectivism and does present  it fairly clearly in its own right, though his ravings against its enemies  should not be taken seriously here or elsewhere.    In short, this is a handy  book for those already familiar with Objectivism but not an adequate  introduction to (or substitute for) the actual writings of Rand herself.  Those who want to read the work of a worthy successor who agrees with Rand  at her best but is something more than an intellectual puppet are advised  to read David Kelley instead. Peikoff ain't it.	1998-11-15

The effect is that the book reads  like an extended philosophical conversation, in which Blanshard deals  personally and closely with each thinker in turn.<br /><br />His replies also indicate  where his thought had grown and developed since the publication of _The  Nature of Thought_ in the 1930s, thereby continuing his thought along the  lines laid down in _Reason and Analysis_, _Reason and Goodness_, and Reason  and Belief_.<br /><br />The essays and replies are arranged topically, covering the  full range of Blanshard's rationalist philosophy.

Building on Ludwig von Mises's masterwork _Human Action_, Rothbard in effect removes Mises's work  from its neo-Kantian setting and places it on a foundation of Aristotelian  realism (though this fact will not be obvious without study of Rothbard's  later work, notably _The Ethics of Liberty_). Rothbard systematically and  rigorously develops all of economic theory from the axiom that human beings  act to achieve ends in a world in which specific and delimitable causes  have specific and delimitable effects. In so doing, he wrote a work that,  almost three decades after its publication, still serves as a comprehensive  introduction to Austrian School economics. And no wonder: Rothbard viewed  Austrian economics particularly and the &quot;science of liberty&quot;  generally as systematic philosophy, not as the mere collection of  statistical facts and &quot;model-building.&quot; The result is a highly  readable volume that reads more like a philosophical treatise than a  standard &quot;economics&quot; textbook.

Unfortunately he throws out the baby and _keeps_ the bathwater: retaining a vague veneer of \\"spirituality,\\" he rejects the  political and economic theories that are in fact the Right's real strength.<br /><br />Proclaiming himself \\"agnostic about capitalism,\\" he nevertheless  proceeds to disagree with capitalism point by point, denouncing the  \\"selfishness\\" and \\"materialism\\" of modern America and  decrying the power of the \\"market\\" to impose values on its  apparently passive victims (shades of Vance Packard!).<br /><br />Our real problem, he  asserts upon astoundingly little evidence, is that we are  \\"systematically misrecognized\\" by our families, friends and  peers; what we need, he says, is a \\"politics of meaning\\" that  seeks to rebuild community and change the \\"bottom line\\" of our  culture.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that he did not feel compelled to study  capitalist theory before rejecting it in toto; otherwise, he might have  learned that the \\"market\\" is precisely a vast network of human  beings cooperating in the production of values and that most of the  \\"problems\\" he cites stem directly from the increasing power of  the federal government. But his characterizations of \\"capitalist  theory\\" suggest that he consulted no higher authority than John  Kenneth Galbraith.<br /><br />If this is the best the Left can do, then the Left is  intellectually bankrupt.

Prof. Hoppe  helpfully locates Rothbard in libertarian scholarly tradition, explains why  Rothbard's work was unjustly ignored while unsystematic but  &quot;tolerant&quot; thinkers like Robert Nozick were unfairly elevated,  refutes the major criticisms that have been offered of Rothbard's work  since the original publication of _The Ethics of Liberty_, and effectively  argues that for natural-law theorist Rothbard, libertarianism was not  &quot;libertinism&quot; but socially quite conservative. Also helpful is  the new format, in which the book's former end-notes are arranged in  footnote style rather than collected at the end of each chapter.	1998-09-12
