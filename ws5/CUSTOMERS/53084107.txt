I'm a big fan of the forensic programs on Court TV, and I always check the date of the featured crime (almost always murder and/or rape) to see if it occurred before or after DNA testing became common in the United States.  If it occurred after 1992, the perp is usually doomed. Even decades-old cases can be solved if blood/semen/saliva samples were properly stored from the crime scene.  According to a prophecy in the weekly \\"New Scientist,\\" there will soon be kits available that will allow police to process DNA samples in less than two hours.<br /><br />In \\"The Blooding,\\" former policeman, Joseph Wambaugh writes about the first serial killer who was caught and convicted through the use of DNA testing:  two teenage girls in the English village of Narborough were brutally raped and murdered in 1983 and 1986, and it took four years, a scientific breakthrough, and the blood of 5,000 men to capture the killer, Colin Pitchfork.  DNA testing also freed the suspect who police had already jailed for the crime.<br /><br />On September 10, 1984, at nearby Leicester University, Dr. Alec Jeffreys (now Sir Alec) discovered that each human being (except for identical twins) has a unique genetic profile.  At first, his DNA profiling technique was used to sort out immigration cases. Then the Leicestershire constabulary became familiar with DNA 'fingerprinting' and collected blood from over 5,000 men in the ultimately successful search for their murderer.<br /><br />(By 2004, the UK had a national database of 2.5 million genetic profiles from convicted criminals.  Statistics show that 38% of all crimes are detected where DNA has been loaded onto the UK national database, compared with a 24% detection rate overall.  And 48% of burglaries are detected where DNA has been loaded onto the database, compared with a 14% detection rate for burglaries overall.<br /><br />Nowadays, even British bus drivers are issued DNA testing kits to help catch passengers who spit at them.)<br /><br />Wambaugh does not spend much time exploring the scientific aspects of the Narborough Village murders.  He tells the interwoven stories of the victims, their families, the murderer, and most especially the policemen who were involved in the hunt.<br /><br />From the shadowy paths that wound past the grounds of the local psychiatric hospital to the ancient, smoke-filled pubs where the villagers spent their free hours, this author will have you living and breathing the horror of these crimes.  There are a few of the patented Wambaugh belly laughs as the Leicestershire police invent their own techniques for 'blooding' the local men. One of my favorite scenes takes place after Colin Pitchfork is apprehended, and he insists on telling his bored interrogators his whole life story before he will confess to his crimes.<br /><br />Everyone comes to life in a Wambaugh story, but most especially the policemen.<br /><br />I have never been able to pick up one of this author's books without reading it through to the end, and \\"The Blooding\\" is no exception.ing the scientific aspects of the Narborough Village murders.

Of those who live there, 73 percent are black, 49 percent have graduated from high school and almost all -- 98 percent -- are renters.  It encompasses Detroit's biggest drug houses, the most hookers, the best Chinese restaurant, the world's largest Masonic Temple (where we used to go see performances of the Metropolitan Opera on Tour), and a gaggle of Wayne State University students who want to live close to campus and are too poor to look elsewhere.  If you stand out in the middle of Second Avenue, a street that runs right through the Corridor (careful, you might get solicited by a cruising john), and look north, you will see what one local radio station insists on calling the 'Golden Tower' of the Fisher Building.<br /><br />This book is about a single murder in 1984 that stood out amongst Detroit's 600+ murders that year because of its brutality, and because of the odd character of the victim, who was a successful psychologist and marital counselor.<br /><br />The murder itself is an anti-climax and occurs near the end of the book.  There is no mystery about who is going to kill whom.  The meat of \\"Masquerade\\" lies in the interactions between pimp, hooker, and sugar daddy.  How did a psychologist with a thriving practice in the 'Golden Tower' of the Fisher Building and a six-bedroom, six-bathroom Tudor in Grosse Pointe Park become so involved with an ordinary streetwalker and her pimp, that he spent over $1,000/week on their drug habits?  How did he manage to keep his life in Cass Corridor a secret for over a year from his psychologist-wife?<br /><br />I can't remember the last time I read with such fascination about lethal relationships and the destruction they wrought on seemingly good marriages and friendships.  Everyone involved ended up with nightmares, even the jurors.<br /><br />Many chapters begin with an ironic quotation from the lectures and books of the murder victim or his psychologist-father.  Even though it isn't a whodunit, you're likely to form an obsessive-compulsive relationship with 'Masquerade' once you begin reading it.<br /><br />This book does sag a bit as it inches toward the murder, and it is depressing as hell to read, but I've already searched the internet to see if I can get another fix from this author.to keep his life in Cass Corridor a secret for over a year from his psychologist-wife?  <br /> <br />I can't remember the last time I read with such fascination about lethal relationships and the destruction they wrought on seemingly good marriages and friendships.

Some of the stories are obviously complete fiction, made up to pad this collection out to book-size. (Sometimes one of the problems with sequels is lack of material.)  As the author puts it in his introduction, \\"Whether you choose to believe any of these tales is essentially immaterial.\\"<br /><br />Some of the stories are framed as eye-witness accounts, e.g. \\"The Lighthouse\\" which was supposedly given to the author by \\"a sailor of long experience.\\"  These tales tend to be cheerfully supernatural:  \\"...we grabbed a couple of beers from the reefer and went ashore in the rubber dingy...[to investigate the haunted lighthouse],\\" and the author certainly seems to have his nautical terminology down pat. (Were sailing ships really called 'wind wagons'?)<br /><br />Instead of a fog-bound hellpit of drowned sailors, the book reminds me of a nautically-themed carnival sideshow, where like the amazing mermaid with the stitched-on fish tail, the supernatural is stitched onto a bit of local history:<br /><br />* Read about the general store that is haunted by the sound of squeaky bedsprings!<br /><br />* Read about the St. Ignace Island Lighthouse of Doom!<br /><br />* Read about the clock that was thrown into a swamp and reappeared in its familiar spot on the wall two days later!<br /><br />* Read about the Crawling Ghost of Calvary Cemetery!<br /><br />If you like your ghost stories funky, eccentric, and cheerful--rather like a Benny Hill episode with ghosts, \\"Haunted Lakes II\\" is a fun book to read.	2005-10-11

Is it possible that \\"Gory Tales Made up Whole-Cloth out of Creatures from Irish Folklore\\" might not have sold?<br /><br />The book's Fir Bolg, Banshees, cursed cows, and malevolent Standing Stones are a grim, snarling, wordy lot--at least the ones with mouths.  The others have to make do with belching sulfur, pulsing with dull malignance, or chewing a cud and staring intensely.<br /><br />I do like the story about the haunted cow.<br /><br />Some of the stories involve priest-exorcists (including one about St. Patrick) and these are not the milk-veined, cross-waving, manicured priests of moviedom.  Many of the creatures they exorcise are pure evil, but some are human, trapped in the shape of a wolf or a cow by a thumping Celtic curse.  Usually a heart-thundering, blood-bubbling physical tussle takes place, as well as the standard tussle for the beast's soul.<br /><br />Okay, so there are a few ghost stories in this book, but mainly it will appeal to those who like their folklore grim and gory.	2005-10-09

It is a rare natural history book that doesn't have this poignant undercurrent.<br /><br />Here is an author who can write knowledgeably about diversified sustainable farming, because he is Old Order Amish and practices what he preaches.  In the introduction, Wendell Berry says, \\"David's life--informed as it is by the Amish reverence for the natural world and the stewardship everywhere implicit in Amish farming--makes a union of economy and ecology.\\"<br /><br />This particular farmer-naturalist times his hay cutting to permit bobolink fledglings to leave the nest.  When he top-seeds his wheat in the spring, his hand-cranked seeder flushes the horned larks and allows him to avoid their nests.<br /><br />The Ohio Amish practice five-crop rotation so crop-damaging insects don't have time to build up.  Horse-worked farms absorb almost seven times more water than conventional no-tilled farms.<br /><br />Is it any wonder that the Amish in my area of middle Michigan at least, are quietly taking over the farm land that could not be made profitable by gigantic machines, insecticides, herbicides, and major debt?<br /><br />Most Amish farmers are not pure organic farmers, but their use of herbicides is minute compared to the average non-organic farmer.  The Soil Conservation Service (SCS) keeps trying to persuade this author that spraying poisons on his land would free him from tilling.  An SCS technician informed him that \\"If I'd join the no-till crowd I'd be freed from plowing, and then my son or I could work in a factory.  He insinuated that the extra income (increased cash flow) would in some way improve the quality of our lives.\\"<br /><br />The author, thank God, fails to get the point.  He asks, \\"Should we give up the kind of farming that has been proven to preserve communities and land and is ecologically and spiritually sound for a way that is culturally and environmentally harmful?\\"<br /><br />In one year, David Kline counted 155 different species of birds on his land.<br /><br />When I was growing up a few hundred miles north of this author's Ohio farm, it was rare in those DDT-laden days to hear even a sparrow sing.  At least we learned a lesson about that particular pesticide, and the birds are making a comeback.  I counted 44 different bird species on our ten acres this year.<br /><br />Maybe that's because I live in a county where the Amish farm.lly and spiritually sound for a way that is culturally and environmentally harmful?\\"  <br /> <br />In one year, David Kline counted 155 different species of birds on his land. <br /> <br />When I was growing up a few hundred miles north of this author's Ohio farm, it was rare in those DDT-laden days to hear even a sparrow sing.

It would have been either the high-point or low-point of our trip if we'd actually caught sight of a long-departed Lord or Lady.  It bothers me to realize that we visited the Tower of London without a clue as to what we really might have seen.<br /><br />However, your trip doesn't need to be spoiled by that same oversight, because Peter Underwood, President of the Ghost Club has published a paranormal tour guide to the haunted historic buildings of Great Britain.  His book was first published back in 1984, but I don't imagine that it has gone out-of-date.  What do the Grey Ladies, Phantom Pipers, and assorted ghostly prisoners in their dungeons care about the passage of time?  According to the author, some of them have been haunting the same spot for several hundred years.<br /><br />Of course, the phantoms may have been exorcised if they frightened too many tourists, so you are still advised to call in advance of your visit.  The author even warns potential visitors, \\"it is not suggested that all these places [in his book] are still haunted...\\"<br /><br />\\"This Haunted Isle\\" is arranged alphabetically, starting with Abbey House, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, and ending with Woburn Abbey, Woburn, Bedfordshire.  Many of the stories begin as follows:  \\"At X we were met by the Duke and Duchess...and in a delightfully informal way they told us of the many unexplained happenings at beautiful and dignified X...\\"  The Ghost Society's visits to haunted sites are as much social outings as they are investigations of paranormal phenomenon.<br /><br />Nevertheless, a reading of this book will send many delightful frissons down the spine with its evocative black-and-white photos and stories of violent deaths and equally violent hauntings.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the stories in \\"This Haunted Isle,\\" author Marc Anderson has also published a ghostly quartet of books on the same subject:  \\"Haunted Castles;\\" \\"Haunted Inns;\\" \\"Haunted Churches & Abbeys of Britain;\\" and \\"Phantom Britain.\\"  I have a slight preference for Marc Anderson over Peter Underwood because of the color he adds to his narratives.

I've only had that experience once in my life and my dream took place in Andre Norton's Witch World.<br /><br />This author kept me turning the pages, not only for the cliff-hangers that the hero, Simon Tregarth gets himself into, but also for glimpses of a strange new, magical landscape.  She doesn't pile on the adjectives, either.  Her prose is remarkably clean.  Just read the lead sentence of \\"Witch World,\\" which introduces us to ex-soldier, Simon Tregarth:<br /><br />\\"The rain was a slantwise curtain across the dingy street, washing soot from city walls, the taste of it metallic on the lips of the tall, thin man who walked with a loping stride close to the buildings, watching the mouths of doorways, the gaps of alleys with a narrow-eyed intentness.\\"<br /><br />He is a hunted man, unjustly cashiered from the U.S. Army for dealing in the post-war blackmarket.  Since Simon had been labeled as a crook, he figured he might as well play the game.<br /><br />After seven years in the underworld, surrounded by his enemies and a gunshot away from death, Simon treats himself to a decent last meal (Andre Norton heroes and heroines NEVER whine.  They assess the odds, then keep on slogging).  Enter the mysterious Doctor Petronius who persuades Simon that he has nothing to lose by vanishing from his enemies' gunsights through the Siege Perilous, a Cornish megalith that is rumored to be a gate to other worlds.  Simon leaves the restaurant with Petronius, almost positive that he is walking into a trap. Instead of the bullet he is expecting, our hero is transported to the foggy moors of a new world.<br /><br />The action doesn't let up.  The first thing Simon does is rescue a witch from a nasty bunch of snake-headed dogs and hunters (we don't learn the witch's name until the very end of the book).  The next thing he knows, he's embroiled in a war where the good guys appear to be losing.<br /><br />Simon allies himself with \\"a tall, proud-walking race with...the carriage of rulers and an odd weight of years upon them.\\"  His new home, medieval Estcarp is a matriarchate, ruled by witches, whose powers depend on their continuing virginity.  Nevertheless, Simon falls in love with the witch he rescued.<br /><br />The enemies that he and Estcarp must confront have invaded Witch World via a gate similar to the Siege Perilous.  The alien Kolder are technically advanced, with submarines and mind-control devices that they use to command their zombie soldiers.<br /><br />Estcarp's only allies are the Sulcarmen, seafaring warriors and traders who lose their main port of Gorm to the Kolder.  Simon, his friend Koris of Gorm, the witch he rescued from the Hounds of Alizon, and a youthful soldier called 'Briant' tread the mysterious byways of Estcarp and its warring neighbors, in an attempt to track down and destroy the technically superior aliens.<br /><br />Lifetime Grand Master of Fantasy, Andre Norton built well.  There are 35 Witch World (WW) fantasies, and the count is probably still rising even though this author passed away on March 17, 2005.  Many of the later WW novels were collaborations, and it wouldn't surprise me if her co-authors attempt to live on in the world that the Grand Master created.

Gould's wondrous creatures of the early Cambrian (530 million years ago), dug out of the Burgess Shale in British Columbia.  I realize that other paleontologists have had problems with some of his anatomical descriptions and theories of punctuated equilibrium (\\"Trilobite\\" spends a chapter defending Gould from some of his more vigorous critics), but the world that he created was strange, beautiful, and compelling.<br /><br />Fortey creates a similar vision of Earth as it existed for 300 million years, starting like Gould, in the Cambrian. No animal better exemplifies the drama of evolution and extinction than trilobites, except perhaps for the Johnny-come-lately dinosaurs.  If you are interested in really deep time, you must travel back before the dinosaurs and peer with the author through the eyes of the trilobites.  \\"'Look into my eyes,' the trilobite seems to say, 'and you will see the vestiges of your own history.'\\"<br /><br />And very strange eyes they are.  In the chapter, \\"Crystal Eyes\\" the author plays an exuberant, complex riff on vision as it first evolved, and most specifically on the uniquely developed eyes of trilobites.  I used to think of these creatures as mud-colored tripartite beetles that crawled around in warm, shallow Paleozoic seas--interesting basically because they lasted so long.  But according to Fortey, their eyes were made of calcite crystals, which \\"makes them unique in the animal kingdom...Look into a crystal of Iceland spar and you can see the secret of the trilobyte's vision.\\"  The author then goes into quite a bit of detail as to why double vision was not a problem for these amazing arthropods, even though their eyes were made up of six-sided crystals.<br /><br />Since the trilobite's eyes were part of its exoskeleton and just as hard, it had to shed them with each molt.<br /><br />Trilobites ranged from dinner-platter-size down to bitty little bugs that were barely a millimeter long.  Fortey describes them in loving detail and also defends the need to collect and study them.  Lord Rutherford's remark that 'all science is either physics or stamp collecting' is vigorously repudiated (I think Rutherford's aphorism must have really stung, because it gets a good bashing in nearly every natural history book in my library).  Just one of the reasons why trilobites are not like stamps is that their distribution helps us determine the outlines of continents and islands that predated not just the modern world, but the ancient supercontinent of Pangaea.<br /><br />Trilobites managed to squeeze through a couple of evolutionary bottlenecks, surviving and multiplying for over 300 million years.  In his heart of hearts, the author admits to hoping that, like the ancient coelacanth, a remnant of this once-vast family of arthropods will be rediscovered, curled up on some unexplored sea bottom, or gazing through crystalline eyes at some newer denizen of the deep.<br /><br />After reading Fortey's fascinating account, I can only hope the same.y a millimeter long.

It ultimately takes its readers to the end of the 20th century, and the technology of satellites and computers.<br /><br />This author explains how the Wright Brothers and other early 20th century aviators gave meteorology a new kick-start after it had begun to languish at the borders of 19th century technology, e.g. the telegraph and lighter-than-air balloons and zeppelins.  But to me, the most amazing chapters in this book deal with the inventiveness and persistence of the 18th and 19th century meteorologists. Much of the theory behind weather forecasting came from their observations.<br /><br />As a trivial but fascinating example, the largest snowflake on record, a whopping 15 inches in diameter, was reported in the nineteenth century--you can see a photograph of this snowflake at the Guinness World Records site.

They were both organized (via publications and ultimately, telegraph lines) and fascinated by the chaotic phenomena in the skies above them.<br /><br />Or was weather completely chaotic?<br /><br />Modern meteorology actually began back in the eighteenth century with Benjamin Franklin and his kite, key, and lightning rod.  Like today's storm-chasers, Franklin had a passion for experiencing weather first-hand, and once he rode alongside a dust-devil on a Maryland trail, describing the bottom as \\"'not bigger than a common barrel,' but at its top, 50 feet high, it flared out to 20 or 30 feet wide.\\"<br /><br />Daring French and British 'aerologists' went up in silk and paper balloons, measuring altitude with their barometers and also by their own physical reactions:  \\"He knew he was at about 17,000 feet when his lips turned blue, at 19,000 feet when his hands became dark blue, and at 22,000 feet when his heart was audible.\\"<br /><br />Those 19th century meteorologists felt it was essential to get up where the weather was, and Lord Kelvin, one of the founders of thermodynamics, helped them explain some of their more puzzling discoveries, such as temperature inversions and the energy of storms.<br /><br />When the Age of Aviation arrived, meteorology already had a good theoretical and observational foundation.  \\"Eye of the Storm\\" takes us close to the end of the twentieth century and the meteorological discoveries that have led to a greater understanding of what Jeffrey Rosenfeld calls the 'ultimate storm,' i.e. hurricanes.

Naturally I grabbed it up to find out why we now have two-sheds-going-on-four on our property.  It isn't completely about storage space, since we have a big, largely empty basement (although I realize it's not going to stay empty for long.  Basements never do).<br /><br />According to the author, sheds were a product of the Dark Ages:  \\"'Scead,' of course, means partial darkness or comparative obscurity.  These are fundamental concepts in understanding what made a Sheddist originally.  He was a kind of wise man, a hermit, an oracle.  He was partially dark and comparatively obscure but ordinary folk knew he was different, in a very special way.\\"<br /><br />It is also suggested that men are encouraged by their spouses to build and inhabit their sheds:  \\"How do you expect me to get on with my womanly, feminine tasks with a great fat useless idle ugly wart like you under my feet the whole time?\\"<br /><br />I refute this sexist notion, as it was entirely my husband's idea to populate our property with sheds.  I hold my tongue because hanging about in a shed is much cheaper than hanging about in a pub.<br /><br />\\"Men and Sheds\\" is a silly, endearing, very British book filled with black-and-white photos of men, their sheds, and the weird things that they store in them, e.g. Ethiopian banjos, reptiles, and  the world's worst LPs.	2005-09-24

There is also information on the mushroom's odor, taste, spores, and habitat (including the season when it can be found).  Additional comments are included on important matters such as edibility.<br /><br />The introduction has directions on how to use this book.  Novice mycologists like me are supposed start at the two-page \\"Beginner's Key\\" that illustrates some of the most common groups (genera) of mushrooms.  So, let me go out and collect a mushroom and see if I can identify it from the \\"Beginner's Key\\"...<br /><br />Unfortunately, my mushroom doesn't look like anything in the \\"Beginner's Key\\" but I have learned two things:  (1) I need to collect the base of the mushroom in order to completely identify it.  I can't just break the mushroom off at ground level; (2) spore color is an important identification key.<br /><br />This book has directions on how to collect spores, but for the impatient it may be possible to scan through all thousand photographs and get a hit without waiting overnight for the spores to show up, which is what I did.  What I thought were three distinct species of mushrooms all turned out to be Shaggy Manes (Coprinus comatus) in different stages of growth.  According to the author, shaggy manes are edible and delicious when young, but the cap liquefies into such an inky mess, I think I'll give them a pass--at least until I become more familiar with fungi.<br /><br />In spite of the fact that my mushroom's genus wasn't in the \\"Beginner's Key,\\" I believe this book will be an important element in my mycological education.  It's the most comprehensive identification guide I've yet found.<br /><br />P.S. The bright yellow mushrooms in our yard are Jack O'Lanterns (Omphalotus illudens)- also not in the \\"Beginner's Key\\" but easily identified from their photograph and description.  According to the author, it is \\"poisonous, but usually not fatal\\" so I'll restrain myself from eating this one, too.he cap liquefies into such an inky mess, I think I'll give them a pass--at least until I become more familiar with fungi. <br /> <br />In spite of the fact that my mushroom's genus wasn't in the \\"Beginner's Key,\\" I believe this book will be an important element in my mycological education.

Michael Innes wrote some of his best, most easily flowing suspense novels starring young men, usually college undergraduates, and \\"The Man from the Sea\\" (1955) is no exception.  His young men are uniformly intelligent (one might even say intellectually arrogant), intrepid, and high-spirited.  They tend to actively seek adventure rather than waiting for adventure to stumble over them.<br /><br />Dick Cranston was playing hide-and-seek on a midnight beach with his lover, Lady Blair, when a naked man walked out of the sea.  Shortly thereafter, someone starts shooting at him.  Cranston makes a split second decision to help the man escape from his would-be-murderers.  He doesn't know that his decision will involve him in a long, at times terrifying journey from the coast of Scotland to London.  He soon learns that the man from the sea is a British nuclear physicist who had defected to the Soviet Union at the beginning of the Cold War, and who now has his own reasons for returning home.<br /><br />This Cold War melodrama has a bit of anti-communist rhetoric, although not nearly as much Evil Empire stuff as other mystery novelists who were writing at the same time, e.g. Rex Stout.  Innes is more interested in the complex character of the man from the sea, who betrayed his country for what might seem like trivial reasons to us, and who might be planning to betray her again.  We don't find out until the end of the book why the man from the sea returned to England.<br /><br />Meanwhile there's a rousing chase across the quarries, beaches, and heath of Scotland wherein Dick Cranston falls out of love twice and into love for a third and probably last time.<br /><br />Love, suspense, and the searing breath of danger envelope us as we follow Cranston and the man from the sea to their final, surprising destination.	2005-09-22

Gervase Fen, Oxford don of English Language and Literature, and amateur detective extraordinaire is hired by the film company as a story consultant, and he is plagued throughout the book by a Scotland Yard detective who is an amateur classics scholar.  Fen wants to discuss the murder.  Chief Inspector Humbleby wants to talk about the Brontes and Dr. Johnson.  Neither one will admit to a less than perfect understanding of either his profession or his hobby, and both despise amateurs.  Their encounters keep \\"Sudden Vengeance\\" sparkling along right up until its final page.  Here is a sample of dialogue, wherein Inspector Humbleby deliberately misunderstands Fen's explanation of the film's subject:<br /><br />\\"Based,\\" Fen reiterated irritably, \\"on the life of Pope.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Pope?\\"<br /><br />\\"Pope.\\"<br /><br />\\"Now which Pope would that be, I wonder?\\" said Humbleby, with the air of one who tries to take an intelligent interest in what is going forward.  \\"Pius, or Clement, or--\\"<br /><br />Fen stared at him.  \\"Alexander, of course.\\"<br /><br />\\"You mean\\"---Humbleby spoke with something of an effort---\\"you mean the Borgia?\\"<br /><br />All of Crispin's characters are carefully (one might say `crisply') developed, and distinguished for the reader by a quirk or eccentric manner of speech (sometimes Crispin overplays the eccentricity at the expense of realism, especially with his main protagonist-- I do wish Fen would stop expostulating, \\"Oh, my fur and whiskers!\\").  Physical description is sketchy.  If one of Crispin's characters walked past you in the street, you probably wouldn't recognize him.  However, if you were to overhear his conversation with the postman---<br /><br />And I don't mean to imply that \\"Sudden Vengeance\\" is all dialogue and no action.  There is one especially harrowing scene where a young woman chases the murderer into a maze in order to learn his identity and then (when reason returns) can't find her way back out again.  By the time Fen rescues her, she has endured an experience right out of an M.R. James horror story (in fact, the young woman quotes M.R. James at length while she is traversing the maze - a typical Crispin characteristic).<br /><br />The mystery surrounding the murderer's identity and motivation is as cleverly convoluted as the maze, and it is equally as hard to get to its heart.  Crispin himself wrote and published at least one film script and composed music for several films, so \\"Sudden Vengeance\\" is told with the knowledge of a movie industry insider.<br /><br />If you like vintage British mysteries with a 'classical education' and haven't yet discovered the Professor Fen novels, then you're in for a treat.ly with his main protagonist-- I do wish Fen would stop expostulating, \\"Oh, my fur and whiskers!\\").

Gould's wondrous creatures of the early Cambrian (530 million years ago), dug out of the Burgess Shale in British Columbia.  I realize that other paleontologists have had problems with some of his anatomical descriptions and theory of punctuated equilibrium (\\"Trilobite\\" spends a chapter defending Gould from some of his more vigorous critics), but the world that he created was strange, beautiful, and compelling.<br /><br />Fortey creates a similar vision of Earth as it existed for 300 million years, starting like Gould, in the Cambrian. No animals better exemplify the drama of evolution and extinction than trilobites, except perhaps for the Johnny-come-lately dinosaurs.  If you are interested in really deep time, you must travel back before the dinosaurs and peer with the author through the eyes of a trilobite.  \\"'Look into my eyes,' the trilobite seems to say, 'and you will see the vestiges of your own history.'\\"<br /><br />And very strange eyes they are.  In the chapter, \\"Crystal Eyes\\" the author plays an exuberant, complex riff on vision as it first evolved, most specifically on the uniquely developed eyes of trilobites.  I used to think of these creatures as mud-colored beetles that spent their lives crawling around on the bottoms of shallow Paleozoic seas--interesting basically because they lasted so long.  But according to Fortey, their eyes were made of calcite crystals, which \\"makes them unique in the animal kingdom...Look into a crystal of Iceland spar and you can see the secret of the trilobyte's vision.\\"<br /><br />The author then goes into quite a bit of detail as to why double vision was not a problem for these amazing arthropods, even though their eyes were made up of six-sided crystals.<br /><br />Since the trilobite's eyes were part of its exoskeleton and just as hard, it had to shed them with each molt.  Imagine, a new set of eyes every time you shed your 'skin!'<br /><br />Trilobites ranged from platter-size down to bitty bugs that were barely a millimeter long.  Fortey describes them in loving detail and also defends the need to collect and study trilobites.  Lord Rutherford's remark that 'all science is either physics or stamp collecting' is vigorously repudiated (I think Rutherford's aphorism must have really stung, because it gets a good bashing in nearly every natural history book in my library).<br /><br />Just one of the reasons why trilobites are not like stamps is that studying their distribution helps us determine the outlines of continents and islands that predated not just the modern world, but the ancient supercontinent of Pangaea.<br /><br />Trilobites managed to squeeze through several evolutionary bottlenecks, surviving and multiplying for over 300 million years.  In his heart of hearts, the author admits to hoping that, like the ancient coelacanth, a remnant of this once-vast family of arthropods will be rediscovered, curled up on some unexplored sea bottom, or gazing through crystalline eyes at a newer denizen of the deep.<br /><br />After reading Fortey's \\"Trilobite,\\" I can only hope the same.obites ranged from platter-size down to bitty bugs that were barely a millimeter long.

If you are interested in the lives of nineteenth-century Americans, most especially what they ate, how they cleaned house, and how they raised their children, this book is a gold mine.<br /><br />In the preface to the first edition of this book, the author quoted foreigners as saying that \\"our climate is unhealthy; that the Americans have, generally, thin forms, sallow complexions, and bad teeth.\\"  However she believed these defects were caused by dietary problems, \\"such as using animal food to excess, eating hot bread, and swallowing our meals with steam-engine rapidity\\" rather than a rotten climate<br /><br />This book was written to point out ways that American dietary deficiencies could be corrected.  The author wanted to teach her readers \\"how to live well, and to be well while we live.\\"  She based her dietetic theories on the works of Dr. Andrew Combe of Edinburgh, and while some of the principles may seem out-dated to those of us who follow diet gurus such as Dr. Atkins, Jenny Craig, or Barry Sears, this author's notion of 'temperance in all things' is still valid--possibly more valid than starving ourselves with Slim-Fast, or low-fats and high carbs, or grapefruit and cabbage.<br /><br />The author was definitely not a vegetarian.  She quoted Scripture to prove that we were meant to eat meat, but in moderation.  Most of the recipes in this book involve meat---everything from beef to turtle.  For instance, to start a batch of rich mince meat, \\"Cut the root off a neat's tongue, rub the tongue well with salt, let it lie four days, wash it perfectly clean, and boil it till it becomes tender...\\"<br /><br />Not only should we make our own bread, but if a barrel of beer is kept in the house, we should make our own yeast.  For those of us who don't have that essential barrel of beer, the author also included yeast recipes that are made from milk or hops.<br /><br />One of my favorite chapters is \\"Household Economy,\\" but a problem with many of the cleaning formulae will be in finding the necessary ingredients.  My grandmother probably knew what spirits of salt and pearlash were, but most of us who were born into the age of Comet Cleanser and Mr. Clean wouldn't know a freestone from a quart of bullock's gall.<br /><br />\\"Early American Cookery\\" is a fascinating historical document, but I don't think many of us will actually attempt the recipes.r also included yeast recipes that are made from milk or hops.<br /><br />One of my favorite chapters is \\"Household Economy,\\" but a problem with many of the cleaning formulae will be in finding the necessary ingredients.

Dr. Sacks accompanied a group of botanical friends on a trip to see, catalogue, draw, and take delight in the unparalleled variety of ferns in Oaxaca, Mexico.  His resulting journal is a meditation on Zapotec culture, amateur naturalists, edible insects, psychedelics, and above all ferns: seemingly so fragile yet having survived, with little change, for over 300 million years.<br /><br />According to the author, his \\"sense of a prehistoric world, of immense spans of time, was first stimulated by ferns and fossil ferns.\\"<br /><br />For someone like myself who loves both ferns and the writings of Dr. Sacks, this journal is a treasure.  It was composed under the blue sky of Oaxaca and filled with an emotion that Dr. Sacks admits is usually foreign to him:  joy.<br /><br />The author is fond of reading natural history journals and he has created a multi-faceted gem of his own, out of observations on lost civilizations, mescal, cochineal insects, plants as rare as horsetails a hundred feet high, and others as common as the bracken fern.<br /><br />Half of our property in Michigan is covered with bracken ferns and I was always curious as to why insects didn't seem to bother them.  According to this author, bracken is regarded as the 'Lucrezia Borgia' of the fern world:  \\"the young fronds release hydrogen cyanide as soon as the insect's mandible tears into them, and if this does not kill or deter the bug, a much crueler poison lies in store.  Brackens, more than any other plants, are loaded with hormones called ecdysones, and when these are ingested by insects, they cause uncontrollable molting.\\"<br /><br />The Romans used bracken on their stable floors because it arrested or perverted the development of fly larvae, although Dr. Sacks doesn't specify how the ancients kept the horses from eating their bedding.  Bracken also poisons mammals, and humans who eat too many fiddle-heads over a long period of time are apt to develop stomach cancer.<br /><br />It is tempting to open up \\"Oaxaca Journal\\" and reread an essay equally as vivid as the riff on the 'Lucrezia Borgia of ferns.'  There are so many choices.

This will not be a problem if you are already planning to enlarge the patterns.<br /><br />In the largest section of \\"Traditional Papercrafts,\\" the author describes and shows photographs of the materials and equipment you will need to get started with the fifteenth-century art of parchment craft.  She does not actually list suppliers, but they are easily discovered out on the internet.  (One of my favorites is \\"willascommodities.com\\".)  You really don't need much to start with, just the correct type of paper (which is not really parchment), scissors with short curved blades and fine points (very much like manicure scissors), a pen and white ink for tracing, a couple of pads to place underneath the paper while embossing and perforating, embossing tools (basically knob-ended sticks to use for drawing & rubbing), and needle tools for perforating the paper into fancy patterns.<br /><br />Many of the directions are illustrated by step-by-step color photographs, especially when the author is demonstrating a new method such as applying color with oil pastels, or using the four-needle tool to make lace.<br /><br />The next section demonstrates the Victorian art of stencil embossing, and requires even less tools than parchment craft:  basically card paper, stencils, fancy-edged rulers (for card edges) and tools fitted with embossing tips (just like you might already own for parchment work).  A lightbox is nice for back-lighting the stencil, so that its outlines can be seen through the paper.  The author demonstrates techniques for producing cameo (raised) designs and intaglio (impressed) images.<br /><br />If you are a fan of all things Celtic, this type of knotwork lends itself very nicely to embossing.<br /><br />Examples of the art of paper pricking can be found in Regency pattern books and correspondence, but the heyday of this craft appears to have been around 1840 - 1860.  As always, the author lists the basic tools and materials (paper, needle, pricking mat) and useful extras, e.g. a needle vice and cuticle scissors.  Some very intricate border patterns that you can prick out are included, with directions on how to enlarge them to card-size.<br /><br />If you really enjoy paper pricking, you may want to advance into paper lace.  Add translucent paper, a sharp craft knife, a tapestry needle and some gold thread to your equipment and construct some very fancy card borders, complete with embroidery.  The author includes patterns and examples of completed projects.<br /><br />The final section of \\"Traditional Papercrafts\\" concerns quilling, the art of tightly winding paper strips, pinching them into various shapes, and gluing the shapes into fancy designs--anything from flowers to coats-of-arms.<br /><br />Supplies include quilling paper (which you can buy pre-cut into strips), quilling tools which resemble small long-needled awls, blank cards, scissors, straight pins, and glue (I suggest paper glue).  Another very useful piece of equipment is a quilling cork board marked with circles where you can pin your petals, rolls, leaves, and hearts into (say) a Christmas wreath before gluing the individual pieces together.  An optional piece of equipment is a fringing tool ($50 at the quillingsuperstore.com).  You might also want a paper crimper.  Both of the latter items are needed for any fancy flower creations.<br /><br />Photographs of the author's quilled border for a holy picture and a free-standing cross are included, as well as directions for creating simpler (much simpler!) designs for cards and Christmas ornaments.<br /><br />If you are at all interested in papercraft, this book is a must-have.ns for cards and Christmas ornaments. <br /> <br />If you are at all interested in papercraft, this book is a must-have. <br />	2005-09-14

When she reaches time's claustrophobic center, Ziantha dies, is reborn, dies, and is reborn, all the while struggling to return to the only world she has known.<br /><br />As a child on the luxury world of Korwar, Ziantha was rescued from an intergalactic refugee-camp-turned-slum called the Dipple.  A member of the all-powerful Guild (Norton's version of the Mafia) discovered that the girl had supernormal talent, including the ability to 'read' objects, and he trains her up as a thief.<br /><br />As the book opens, Ziantha has broken into the apartment of High Lord Jucundus, loaded to the gills with high-tech equipment and, of course, her own esper abilities.

The Thames itself stars as a vicious, unpredictable bully, killing rash boatmen who tried to 'shoot' between the bridge's piers.  \\"Many people refused point blank to go 'through the Bridge', such was the frequent loss of life...\\"<br /><br />As the bridge was built, the river was seriously and increasingly restricted.  Many lives were lost (the author estimates about 200 during the thirty-three years of construction in the twelfth century) as the bridge's nineteen arches were built under and over the wide, swiftly flowing, tidal river.<br /><br />One of the most interesting sections of \\"Old London Bridge\\" involves speculation on exactly how the bridge was built.  The Thames was neither dammed nor diverted, so how were the bridge's foundations sunk and strengthened?  \\"Interestingly, Sir Christopher Wren later considered the question, and concluded that....'every Pier was set upon Piles of Wood, which were drove as far as might be under low Watermark, on which were laid planks of Timber, and upon them the Foundation of the Stone Piers.'\\"<br /><br />His theory was confirmed when the Old London Bridge was deconstructed in the nineteenth century.<br /><br />Once the bridge was built, it had to be constantly repaired.  The Bridge Masters or Bridge Wardens were in daily charge of not only maintaining the bridge, but also for using its lands and rents to pay for the repairs.<br /><br />This book is full of the noise and ingenuity of the bridge-dwellers and everyone who crossed through their stony territory.  The author frames some of the greatest spectacles seen during Old London Bridge's 600-year existence, including a joust, royal processions, and Midsummer's Eve celebrations.  It seemed a shame to many that the houses and gateways on the bridge were finally removed in the eighteenth century.  An anonymous poet wrote:  \\"The Bravest sight that I e'er ken/ Was London Bridge with its gay shopmen:/ Where all might find what they did lack,/ From an ABC to a pin's pack;/ But now the shops are clear'd away,/ Heigh-ho! Alas! and a well-a-day!\\"<br /><br />We can only read and speculate on what Old London Bridge was like in its noisy, mercantile prime.  This author does a fine job of reproducing the heroism, squabbling, smells, and the constant procession of humanity that crossed the nineteen crowded arches above the swift currents of Father Thames.The Bravest sight that I e'er ken/ Was London Bridge with its gay shopmen:/ Where all might find what they did lack,/ From an ABC to a pin's pack;/ But now the shops are clear'd away,/ Heigh-ho!

It is mythology without the density of \\"The Golden Bough,\\" but still with the serious purpose of teaching world views that may seem strange to non-Amerinds.<br /><br />I needed to ponder the implications of these stories.  I wondered if coyote creation myths were any more unbelievable than the invention of a CNN 'faith and values' correspondent, or the news of a televangelist encouraging his fellow Christians to assassinate a foreign head-of-state.  Are they stranger to the human experience than mullahs issuing death fatwas against authors or encouraging followers to gang-rape young women?<br /><br />Coyote steals, rapes and murders in these sixty-eight stories from forty-two different First Nation tribes.  He is a Creator, dupe, loving husband, and lusty rogue; a sorcerous Rhett Butler with a brushy tail and extreme bipolar disorder.  My favorite stories involve other clever creatures who dupe the Trickster into eating his own anus or tossing his eyeballs into a tree.  It's always good to see a powerful bully with an uncertain temper taken down a notch or two.<br /><br />Luckily Coyote is able to laugh at himself, unlike certain gods on the other side of the Atlantic.	2005-09-11

This will not be a problem if you are already planning to enlarge the patterns.<br /><br />In the largest section of \\"Traditional Papercrafts,\\" the author describes and shows photographs of the materials and equipment you will need to get started with the fifteenth-century art of parchment craft.  She does not actually list suppliers, but they are easily discovered out on the internet.  (One of my favorites is \\"willascommodities.com\\".)  You really don't need much to start with, just the correct type of paper (which is not really parchment), scissors with short curved blades and fine points (very much like manicure scissors), a pen and white ink for tracing, a couple of pads to place underneath the paper while embossing and perforating, embossing tools (basically knob-ended sticks to use for drawing & rubbing), and needle tools for perforating the paper into fancy patterns.<br /><br />Many of the directions are illustrated by step-by-step color photographs, especially when the author is demonstrating a new method such as applying color with oil pastels, or using the four-needle tool to make lace.<br /><br />The next section demonstrates the Victorian art of stencil embossing, and requires even less tools than parchment craft:  basically card paper, stencils, fancy-edged rulers (for card edges) and tools fitted with embossing tips (just like you might already own for parchment work).  A lightbox is nice for back-lighting the stencil, so that its outlines can be seen through the paper.  The author demonstrates techniques for producing cameo (raised) designs and intaglio (impressed) images.<br /><br />If you are a fan of all things Celtic, this type of knotwork lends itself very nicely to embossing.<br /><br />Examples of the art of paper pricking can be found in Regency pattern books and correspondence, but the heyday of this craft appears to have been around 1840 - 1860.  As always, the author lists the basic tools and materials (paper, needle, pricking mat) and useful extras, e.g. a needle vice and cuticle scissors.  Some very intricate border patterns that you can prick out are included, with directions on how to enlarge them to card-size.<br /><br />If you really enjoy paper pricking, you may want to advance into paper lace.  Add translucent paper, a sharp craft knife, a tapestry needle and some gold thread to your equipment and construct some very fancy card borders, complete with embroidery.  The author includes patterns and examples of completed projects.<br /><br />The final section of \\"Traditional Papercrafts\\" concerns quilling, the art of tightly winding paper strips, pinching them into various shapes, and gluing the shapes into fancy designs--anything from flowers to coats-of-arms.<br /><br />Supplies include quilling paper (which you can buy pre-cut into strips), quilling tools which resemble small long-needled awls, blank cards, scissors, straight pins, and glue (I suggest paper glue).  Another very useful piece of equipment is a quilling cork board marked with circles where you can pin your petals, rolls, leaves, and hearts into (say) a Christmas wreath before gluing the individual pieces together.  An optional piece of equipment is a fringing tool ($50 at the quillingsuperstore.com).  You might also want a paper crimper.  Both of the latter items are needed for any fancy flower creations.<br /><br />Photographs of some fine old quilled borders for holy pictures and free-standing crosses are included, as well as directions for creating simpler designs for cards and Christmas ornaments.<br /><br />If you are at all interested in papercraft, this book is a must-have.d Christmas ornaments. <br /> <br />If you are at all interested in papercraft, this book is a must-have. <br /> <br />	2005-09-09

Daniel Easterman relies on a common theme in many of his ghostly novels, i.e. child abuse taken to the grave and beyond.  \\"Naomi's Room\\" (1991) and the author's later novel, \\"The Vanishment\\" (1993) both expand on this theme and both have first-person narrators who may or may not be involved in foul deeds themselves.<br /><br />Jonathan Aycliffe keeps cranking out the supernatural shocks in \\"Naomi's Room.\\"  Even though I could sometimes guess what was coming, I had put down this book several times and tell myself, \\"It's only fiction,\\" before I could keep on reading.  A couple of really bad scenes:<br /><br />* The narrator is awakened by the thump-thump of something being dragged into the attic, and realizes that his wife is no longer in bed with him.<br /><br />* A news photographer shows the narrator photographs of his house in Cambridge.  Yeah, there are ghosts peering out of the attic, but also the narrator's wife who he knows was not in Cambridge at the time.<br /><br />There is a great deal of foreshadowing in this novel, which is to be expected since the narrator is telling his story many years after it took place.  In spite of all of the hints that the author drops, the book's ending is still a shock.  We know that he wakes up in the darkness, night after night, hearing noises, sometimes seeing horrors that he only hints at.  Why does he stay in the house?  Is love or guilt chaining him to the house where so many macabre deeds were performed?<br /><br />Aycliffe brings in one character toward the end of the novel that I don't think he really needed--if he's already driving the plot forward through the actions of evil ghosts, why drag in evil men?  Also the narrator's attempts to sidetrack the police by leaving fingerprints about from a few detached fingers he happens to have in his possession didn't strike me as something that would fool a CID man for very long.<br /><br />In spite of the questionable fingerprints and maybe an extra character or two, \\"Naomi's Room\\" is a very haunting story.  If a movie is ever made of it, I don't think I could nerve myself to watch it, even in company with a theatre-full of other people.ingerprints and maybe an extra character or two, \\"Naomi's Room\\" is a very haunting story.

Even if I had not read the back of the book's dust jacket, I would have known that Nigel Calder was a former writer for the ebullient British weekly, \\"New Scientist.\\"  He's got their opinionated, breezy, clear style of writing.  \\"Magic Universe\\" scintillates.  It is easy to understand.  The author does not linger overly long on even the most fascinating topics (actually, this brevity is sometimes frustrating).<br /><br />There are several ways of working through the book.  There is the 'spider-web' method as illustrated by the book's end-papers, where all of the subjects are ultimately linked together.  For instance, I started onto a subject path with \\"Volcanic Explosions (where will the next big one be?)\\" which led to \\"Hotspots (are there really chimneys deep inside the Earth?)\\" which pointed to \\"Plate Motions (what rocky machinery refurbishes the Earth's surface?)\\" which sent me back to \\"Extremophiles (creatures that thrive in unexpected places).\\"<br /><br />According to the author, the \\"spider's web\\" celebrates a reunion of the many subdivisions of science that is now in progress...\\" but I'm getting dizzy flipping back and forth.  Let's try an alphabetic read-through for awhile, starting at \\"Extremophiles\\"--> \\"Flood Basalts (can impacting comets set continents in motion?)\\"--> \\"Flowering (colourful variations on a theme of genetic pathways)\\" --> \\"Forces (a pointer entry).\\"<br /><br />Wait a minute, here's an interesting entry about something called the 'Casimir force (the attractive force between two surfaces in a vacuum).'  I've never heard of it, even though I'm a faithful cover-to-cover reader of \\"New Scientist.\\"  Where does it point?  To \\"Plasma Crystals.\\"  What is a Plasma Crystal?  Isn't that an oxymoron?  Let me just follow this topic a little further...<br /><br />Warning: if you like good writing, especially concerning outr&eacute;, outer-edge-of-science topics, you might not be able to put down \\"Magic Universe\\" until you've read every 'short story' in this book.  From first-hand experience, the author knows that \\"thrilling discoveries can tip-toe in, almost unnoticed to begin with.\\"<br /><br />There were many thrilling discoveries for me.  Consider those plasma crystals.  They opened up many windows in astronomy for me, including a new look at the method by which planets form.<br /><br />Nigel Calder also believes that the surest way to shorten this book's life would be to \\"report only the consensual opinions of the late 20th century.\\"  To drive home this point, let me quote from his article on \\"Superstrings (Retuning the cosmic imagination):\\"  \\"A scandalous fact was not lost on the bystanders.  This was the lack of even the smallest shred of direct evidence for the validity of either superstring or M-theory as a description of the real world.\\"  What can a great science writer like the author do, but refer to Lewis Carroll's White Knight:  \\"But I was thinking of a plan/ to dye one's whiskers green, /And always use so large a fan /That they could not be seen.\\"<br /><br />Do superstrings exist?

In \\"Forerunner Foray\\" (1973) her heroine, Ziantha twists and turns through multiple chambers of time as though crawling deeper and deeper into the curling interior of a nautilus shell.  When she reaches time's claustrophobic center, Ziantha dies, is reborn, dies, and is reborn, all the while struggling to return to the only world she has known.<br /><br />As a child on the luxury world of Korwar, Ziantha was rescued from an intergalactic refugee-camp-turned-slum called the Dipple.  A member of the all-powerful Guild (Norton's version of the Mafia) discovered that the girl had supernormal talent, including the ability to 'read' objects, and he trains her up as a thief.<br /><br />As the book opens, Ziantha has broken into the apartment of High Lord Jucundus, loaded to the gills with high-tech equipment and, of course, her own esper abilities.  She psychometrizes (reads) the microrecordings that she was sent to find and is about to leave the apartment, when she is almost felled by a psychic demand for her attention.

The majority of its beautiful photographs show landscapes that gardeners of modest means can only dream about.  I used the book to point out photographs of steps and retaining walls that I liked to the local landscaping firm, then we'd have a good laugh about the price, and work out cheaper compromises.  For instance, instead of stone steps I now have wooden stairs leading down to the river.<br /><br />Don't misunderstand me, though.  There are some very good ideas in this book.  For instance, we used the suggestion to zig-zag the stairs down the slope, both to make the climb a bit easier (the slope varies from about 1:6 to 1:2) and to make the journey to the river more interesting.<br /><br />This book is divided into five sections:<br /><br />* \\"Understanding your Terrain\\"--this section is very important, no matter how much money you plan to spend.  It discusses types of hillsides (most especially the severity of the slope) , drainage considerations, and whether or not the landscape needs to be reshaped, e.g. terraced.<br /><br />* \\"Inspiring Ideas\\"--beautiful photographs of slopes, decks, patios, steps, retaining walls, water features, etc. with suggestions on placement, materials, and plantings.<br /><br />* \\"It's all in the planning\\"--a very useful chapter, including the ABCs of garden design, and the mechanics of plotting your property.  One of this chapter's suggestions that we plan to implement is a 'dry creekbed' to drain water from our backyard slope.<br /><br />* \\"Building on slopes\\"--Many landscaping features such as fences are more challenging to build on a slope.  This chapter explains what factors you need to consider when building or gardening on a slope.  I learned NOT to pull up weeds and saplings from their downhill side, after yanking out a small alder, losing my balance, and tumbling over the dry-stone retaining wall and down the steps.  It was a cheap way of conducting my own bone density scan, but I wouldn't recommend this procedure to anyone else!  I was also very glad that we had decided to build the steps out of wood, not stone.<br /><br />* \\"Focusing on plants\\"--Erosion control.  Erosion control.  Erosion control.

I don't believe I've ever read a ghost book that had so many animals, both living and supernatural.<br /><br />For instance, the Foxes of Gormanston come out of their coverts and gather around a castle in County Meath whenever the death of a Viscount is imminent.  \\"The legend maintains that they first appeared at the death of a Gormanston who had once saved the life of a vixen in a hunt.\\"<br /><br />This is one of the more cheerful stories in \\"Irish Ghosts,\\" although it must be rather upsetting to the Viscount when the foxes start ringing his castle.<br /><br />The Irish are good at curses.  There are even Cursing Stones in County Dublin where a curser can kneel and specify the type of doom he wants to hurl upon his enemies.  One of the many black-and-white photographs in this book shows the Cursing Stones in a grove of very twisted, forlorn-looking trees.  Maybe someone cursed them, too.<br /><br />One of the most original stories, maybe unique to Ireland, concerns a priest who \\"must have died with a Mass on his soul that he left unsaid...\\"  One All Souls' Eve as a man passed old Mass Rock in the Donegal countryside, he saw that the stone altar was laid out for Mass.  The candles were lit and a priest was standing by and he asked if the passerby could help serve Mass.  He obliged, and the next day learned that the priest had died thirty-five years prior to the midnight service.<br /><br />All of the stories in this book are meticulously documented and uniquely Irish.  They bear such titles as \\"The Black Cat of Killakee,\\" \\"The Tragic Bride of Charles Fort,\\" and \\"The Aughavanagh Hangman.\\"  Anyone who desires to make a supernatural tour of Ireland could use this amiable, copiously illustrated book as a guide.	2005-09-04

When Sarah vanishes after a minor supernatural build-up, my first reaction was relief.  I thought, 'Good, she finally dumped the s.o.b.'<br /><br />However the manner of her disappearance was rather strange, i.e. in the middle of the night in her nightgown, without her purse.  So then I began to wonder if her husband had murdered her.  It's rare for a first-person narrator to murder someone without the reader's knowledge, but this literary trick has been attempted before with varying degrees of success--Dame Agatha Christie comes to mind.<br /><br />Jonathan Aycliffe includes some original supernatural shocks in \\"The Vanishment.\\"  The narrator is a writer and Petherick House in Cornwall by the sea acts like a jolt of amphetamine to his talent.  He writes and writes, and when he finally submits his accumulated short stories, he gets a puzzling phone call from his publisher:  \\"How come all you've sent me is twenty copies of the same piece?\\"<br /><br />The piece in question is a fragment of a transcript of an inquest that took place long before the narrator was born.  It concerns the death by drowning of a daughter of Petherick House.  She had borne a child out-of-wedlock back in the days of Queen Victoria.  Her child disappeared, her father (who was also supposed to be the father of her child) died, and the inquest concluded that the woman named Susannah committed suicide.<br /><br />But \\"The Vanishment\\" is not that simple a haunting.  There is real evil in Petherick House and it follows Peter Clare back to London and into the house of his friends.<br /><br />This novel of the supernatural isn't my favorite Jonathan Aycliffe.  \\"The Talisman\\" (1999) and \\"A Shadow on the Wall\\" (2000) hold that honor.  There are some fine frights in \\"The Vanishment\\" (1993) but not enough to compensate for my dislike of the narrator.  Also the ending left me puzzled.  What did Peter Clare remove from the closet under the stairs and throw into the sea?  I went back over the final chapter a couple of times, and it's irritating to report that I still don't know what it was./> <br />But \\"The Vanishment\\" is not that simple a haunting.

Even if I had not read the back of the book's dust jacket, I would have known that Nigel Calder was a former writer for the ebullient British weekly, \\"New Scientist.\\"  He's got their opinionated, breezy, clear style of writing.  \\"Magic Universe\\" scintillates.  It is easy to understand.  The author does not linger overly long on even the most fascinating topics (actually, this brevity is sometimes frustrating).<br /><br />There are several ways of working through the book.  There is the 'spider-web' method as illustrated by the book's end-papers, where all of the subjects are ultimately linked together.  For instance, I started onto a subject path with \\"Volcanic Explosions (where will the next big one be?)\\" which led to \\"Hotspots (are there really chimneys deep inside the Earth?)\\" which pointed to \\"Plate Motions (what rocky machinery refurbishes the Earth's surface?)\\" which sent me back to \\"Extremophiles (creatures that thrive in unexpected places).\\"<br /><br />According to the author, his spider's web \\"celebrates a reunion of the many subdivisions of science that is now in progress...\\" but I'm getting dizzy flipping back and forth.  Let's try an alphabetic read-through for awhile, starting at \\"Extremophiles\\" --> \\"Flood Basalts (can impacting comets set continents in motion?)\\"--> \\"Flowering (colourful variations on a theme of genetic pathways)\\" --> \\"Forces (a pointer entry).\\"<br /><br />Wait a minute, here's an interesting entry about something called the 'Casimir force (the attractive force between two surfaces in a vacuum).'  I've never heard of it, even though I'm a faithful cover-to-cover reader of \\"New Scientist.\\"  Where does Casimir's force point?  To \\"Plasma Crystals.\\"  What is a Plasma Crystal?  Isn't that an oxymoron?  Just let me just follow this topic a little further...<br /><br />Warning: if you like good writing, especially concerning outr&eacute;, outer-edge-of-science topics, you might not be able to put down \\"Magic Universe\\" until you've read every 'short story' in this book.  From first-hand experience, the author knows that \\"thrilling discoveries can tip-toe in, almost unnoticed to begin with.\\"<br /><br />This book held many thrilling discoveries for me.  Consider those plasma crystals.  They opened up many new windows in astronomy for me, including a fresh look at the method by which planets form.<br /><br />Nigel Calder also believes that the surest way to shorten this book's life would be to \\"report only the consensual opinions of the late 20th century.\\"  To drive home this point, read what he has to say about superstrings: \\"A scandalous fact was not lost on the bystanders.  This was the lack of even the smallest shred of direct evidence for the validity of either superstring or M-theory as a description of the real world.\\"<br /><br />What can a good science writer like the author do with an unproven theory?<br /><br />Quote Lewis Carroll, of course:  \\"But I was thinking of a plan/ to dye one's whiskers green, /And always use so large a fan /That they could not be seen.\\"<br /><br />Do superstrings exist?

The editor, Lamar Underwood has selected seventeen harrowing excerpts from books and articles grouped under the titles, \\"Terrorist Attacks,\\" \\"The Crucible of Fire: Tragedy, Escape, and Remembrance,\\" \\"Natural Causes: When Time and Luck Run Out,\\" \\"Disaster at Sea: Victims, Heroes, and Doomed Voyages,\\" and \\"The Hand of Man: Of Failure and Catastrophe.\\"  He does a masterful job of bringing you in, up close and personal.  I don't think you'll be able to shield yourself from the horror of the victims' plights, most especially in last section of this book:  \\"Flights that Failed:  Aviation's Darkest Hours.\\"<br /><br />It was not a good idea to read this book a week before I plan to fly to London.  I most especially recommend that you do NOT read \\"The Greatest Disaster Stories Ever Told\\" while actually seated on a plane.<br /><br />I had already read a couple of the books that Underwood used as sources, and so I can personally testify that he did a tremendous job of selecting the most frightening, heart-wrenching parts of \\"Isaac's Storm\\" and \\"The Johnstown Flood\\" to include in his anthology.<br /><br />Don't be surprised if you find yourself searching out the editor's original book selections, in order to discover the ultimate fate of the victims.  I need to find Arthur Weingarten's book, \\"The Sky is Falling\\" (1977 - Grosset & Dunlap), excerpted here, to learn the outcome of a day in New York City in 1945 that foreshadowed 9/11--the day that a B-25 bomber crashed into the Empire State Building.<br /><br />Weingarten's account of an elevator operator who hurtled 76 stories down into the basement of the Empire State Building, after the six braided steel cables of her elevator were sliced through by the B-25's engine, which then broke through the elevator's roof, is especially terrifying (Claustrophobes, do not read this story!):  \\"Out of the corner of her eye she caught sight of the red lights flashing on the panel indicator.  76...75...74...The numbers were running into a vertical blur...she flung herself across the car, raising her hands above her head to ward off the flaming debris that poured through the hole in the roof.\\"<br /><br />Did Betty, the elevator operator survive her crushing, fiery descent?<br /><br />What provisions were made for the victims of the Bhopal Catastrophe?<br /><br />What was the ultimate fate of the survivors of the 'Lusitania' and the 'U.S.S.

In \\"Forerunner Foray\\" (1973) her heroine, Ziantha twists and turns through multiple chambers of time as though crawling deeper and deeper into the curling interior of a nautilus shell.  When she reaches time's claustrophobic center, Ziantha dies, is reborn, dies, and is reborn, all the while struggling to return to the only world she has known.<br /><br />As a child on the luxury world of Korwar, Ziantha was rescued from an intergalactic refugee-camp-turned-slum called the Dipple.  A member of the all-powerful Guild (Norton's version of the Mafia) discovered that the girl had supernormal talent, including the ability to 'read' objects, and he trains her up as a thief.<br /><br />As the book opens, Ziantha has broken into the apartment of High Lord Jucundus, loaded to the gills with high-tech gizmos and, of course, her own esper abilities.  She psychometrizes (reads) the microrecordings that she was sent to find and is about to leave the apartment, when she is almost felled by a psychic demand for her attention.  It is a dusty lump of clay on Lord Jucundus's knick-knack table. Ziantha resists the urge to steal it, but the next morning she returns to a park next to the apartment building and apports (psychically transports) the ugly little object into her possession.<br /><br />Her Guild masters discover Ziantha's extra-curricular thievery, and after their initial anger they become intrigued by the strange object which has psychically bonded itself to their errant apprentice.  Buried within the clay is a Forerunner artifact called a focus-stone.<br /><br />The alien artifact has an agenda of its own. It wishes to be reunited with its 'twin' and leads Ziantha and her masters to a burned-off planet, then hurtles the psychic back through time, into the body of a war slave who has been chained into her captor's tomb!<br /><br />As she struggles to breathe, Ziantha-now-Vintra realizes that the corpse beside her is moving.  Another psychic has been dragged through time by the focus-stone and dumped into the body of the deceased enemy general.<br /><br />Ris Lantee, son of Shan Lantee of \\"Storm over Warlock\\" and \\"Ordeal in Otherwhere\\" fame is the valiant hero of \\"Forerunner Foray.\\"  He suffers an even worse fate than Ziantha in that he is transferred into the body of the dead warrior and ruler, Turan and must spent a large part of the novel keeping the corpse reanimated while he and Ziantha quest for the second focus-stone.<br /><br />Ris-now-Turan is finally in such bad shape that Ziantha must make a solo quest further back into the burned-out planet's history in order to recover the second focus stone.<br /><br />Now her ordeal truly begins.<br /><br />This SF novel is fairly standard Norton except for her heroine's powerful to-the-death struggle in an ancient storm-wracked seahold.  Ziantha tries to recover the alien artifact that will return her to her own time while her new alter-ego, D'Eyree attempts to save a whole world.<br /><br />I think Norton realized what a powerful setting she had created in the drowning sea-hold of Nornath, as she used a very similar background in \\"Perilous Dreams\\" (1976).at the corpse beside her is moving.

Until his death in 1999 Brian Marriner was one of Britain's leading true crime authors and he does more than report the details of a crime---he also attempts to probe the motive and thinking behind the gruesome acts in this book.<br /><br />Crime writer Colin Wilson writes a long forward on how our interpretation of sex crimes has changed through the years.  He believes the 'Age of Sex Crimes' was \\"launched by the unknown maniac known as Jack the Ripper.\\"  He also believes that because of great strides in the science of forensics \\"sex crime is one day destined to become as obsolete as stage-coach robbery or cattle rustling.\\"<br /><br />Thus this book could contain the major cases from what Wilson predicts is the world's worst century of sex crime.  I hope his optimism proves to be justified.<br /><br />In Marriner's introduction, he makes no secret of the fact that \\"writing a book which detailed the most sordid and depraved acts of which human beings are capable was not a pleasant experience.\\"  However he believes that sex killers speak to us through their crimes in a kind of code, and that this book can contribute to understanding that code.<br /><br />Unlike Colin Wilson, this author believes that the 'modern age of the sex killer' was ushered in by Reggie Christie, who killed at least six women in his London home in the 1950s.  \\"His crimes were as passionless as they were perverted and, perhaps for this reason, the Christie case still has the power to horrify and shock.\\"  Christie's crimes were the ones that forced the knowledge onto the rest of us that such acts were not committed by those possessed by devils, or the completely insane.  We began to recognize another kind of sex criminal, one who \\"employed a cool, twisted logic to satisfy his gruesome predilections...\\"  This is the age of the sexual psychopath, or to employ more recent terminology, sexual 'sociopath.'  Sociopaths commit crimes because they want to, not because they're insane, and they seem to have no empathy for their victims.<br /><br />These are the topics Marriner covers in his eighteen chapters and conclusion:  \\"The German Sex Killers;\\" \\"Peter K&uuml;rten: 'King of Sexual Delinquents';\\" \\"Lovers of the Dead;\\" \\"Reggie 'No-Dick' Christie;\\" \\"The British Years;\\" \\"New Light on the Moors Murders;\\" \\"America: Land of the Free;\\" \\"The Appliance of Science - Tessnow - Pitchfork - Duffy;\\" \\"Peter Sutcliffe - The Yorkshire Ripper;\\" Dennis Nilsen - The Deadly Scavenger;\\"  \\"Robert Black - Murderer of Childhood;\\" \\"The Stockwell Strangler;\\" \\"Heidnik;\\" \\"Jeffery Dahmer:  The Milwaukee Cannibal;\\" \\"The Monster of Florence;\\" \\"Jack Unterweger - The Killing Poet;\\" \\"Colin Ireland - Killing for Fame;\\" \\"Andrei Chikatilo - The Rostov Ripper;\\" \\"Inside the Mind of the Sex Killer.\\"<br /><br />As you can see from the above, the author picks and chooses his cases so this book is by no means an encyclopedic treatment of sexual predators.

I've only had that experience once in my life and my dream took place in Andre Norton's Witch World.<br /><br />This author kept me turning the pages, not only for the cliff-hangers that the hero, Simon Tregarth gets himself into, but also for glimpses of a strange new, magical landscape.  She doesn't pile on the adjectives, either.  Her prose is remarkably clean.  Just read the lead sentence of \\"Witch World,\\" which introduces us to ex-soldier, Simon Tregarth:<br /><br />\\"The rain was a slantwise curtain across the dingy street, washing soot from city walls, the taste of it metallic on the lips of the tall, thin man who walked with a loping stride close to the buildings, watching the mouths of doorways, the gaps of alleys with a narrow-eyed intentness.\\"<br /><br />He is a hunted man, unjustly cashiered from the U.S. Army for dealing in the post-war blackmarket.  Since Simon had been labeled as a crook, he figured he might as well play the game.<br /><br />After seven years in the underworld, surrounded by his enemies and a gunshot away from death, Simon treats himself to a decent last meal (Andre Norton heroes and heroines NEVER whine.  They assess the odds, then keep on slogging).  Enter the mysterious Doctor Petronius who persuades Simon that he has nothing to lose by vanishing from his enemies' gunsights through the Siege Perilous, a Cornish megalith that is rumored to be a gate to other worlds.  Simon leaves the restaurant with Petronius, almost positive that he is walking into a trap. Instead of the bullet he is expecting, our hero is transported to the foggy moors of a new world.<br /><br />The action doesn't let up.  The first thing Simon does is rescue a witch from a nasty bunch of snake-headed dogs and hunters (we don't learn the witch's name until the very end of the book).  The next thing he knows, he's embroiled in a war where the good guys appear to be losing.<br /><br />Simon allies himself with \\"a tall, proud-walking race with...the carriage of rulers and an odd weight of years upon them.\\"  His new home, medieval Estcarp is a matriarchate, ruled by witches, whose powers depend on their continuing virginity.  Nevertheless, Simon falls in love with the witch he rescued.<br /><br />The enemies that he and Estcarp must confront have invaded Witch World via a gate similar to the Siege Perilous.  The alien Kolder are technically advanced, with submarines and mind-control devices that they use to command their zombie soldiers.<br /><br />Estcarp's only allies are the Sulcarmen, seafaring warriors and traders who lose their main port of Gorm to the Kolder.  Simon, his friend Koris of Gorm, the witch he rescued from the Hounds of Alizon, and a youthful soldier called 'Briant' tread the mysterious byways of Estcarp and its warring neighbors, in an attempt to track down and destroy the technically superior aliens.<br /><br />Lifetime Grand Master of Fantasy, Andre Norton built well.  There are 35 Witch World (WW) fantasies, and the count is probably still rising even though this author passed away on March 17, 2005.  Many of the later WW novels were collaborations, and it wouldn't surprise me if her co-authors attempt to live on in the world that the Grand Master created.  I wish them well, but so far they have not managed to penetrate the brilliantly weird landscapes of Andre Norton's imagination.od guys appear to be losing. <br /> <br />Simon allies himself with \\"a tall, proud-walking race with...the carriage of rulers and an odd weight of years upon them.\\"  His new home, medieval Estcarp is a matriarchate, ruled by witches, whose powers depend on their continuing virginity.

The lines of tourists waiting to view this famous eighth century manuscript were about a quarter of a mile long, and the museum proctors were really hustling us through the area where a small sampling of pages was actually on view.<br /><br />(If you take the tour, be sure to check out the main chamber of the Old Library with its first editions of Newton and Darwin, plus the harp that is (alas, falsely) attributed to Brian Boru, high king of Ireland).<br /><br />The first facsimile of the Book of Kells was published in 1974, and although this book only advertises itself as 'an illustrated introduction to the manuscript...' it contains good color plates of many of the most famous pages, e.g. the symbols of the four evangelists and the beginning of the 'Breves causae' of Matthew, among others.<br /><br />Author, Bernard Meehan, the current Keeper of Manuscripts at Trinity College states that \\"the sacred text itself was copied in the Book of Kells with a remarkable degree of inaccuracy.\\"  It consists of the Latin text of the Gospels, illuminated in the very ornate Hiberno-Saxon style ('Hiberno' refers to the Irish, or Hibernians).<br /><br />Legend has it that the Book of Kells was produced by St. Colum Cille on the island of Iona off western Scotland.  Although it was probably begun in the Irish monastery on Iona, it was taken to the monastery of Kells in County Meath, after a series of Viking raids.  The monastery on Iona was pillaged in 795, and again in 802.  According to the author, \\"In 806, sixty-eight of the community were killed in another raid.  The following year, the survivors migrated to Ireland and began to erect conventual buildings at Kells...\\" where the illumination of the manuscript was probably completed.<br /><br />If you are interested in the historical background of the Book of Kells, the author devotes a whole Appendix to it.<br /><br />Alas, according to this book's second Appendix, \\"Losses, Additions and Marginalia,\\" the Book of Kells has not remained intact down through the centuries.  \\"At present there are 340 folios, but around thirty folios, including some major decorated pages have been lost.\\"  The monks also used blank spaces in the manuscript to record details of property transactions in the late eleventh and twelfth centuries.<br /><br />Meehan's book is definitely worth viewing and reading.  It also  contains a wealth of the smaller decorative illustrations that do not always relate to the sacred text, e.g. hares, dogs, horses, and at least one moth.  The color and minute details of these decorations are a source of endless fascination, and the scholarly text, although a trifle dry, is also very interesting.cond Appendix, \\"Losses, Additions and Marginalia,\\" the Book of Kells has not remained intact down through the centuries.  \\"At present there are 340 folios, but around thirty folios, including some major decorated pages have been lost.\\"  The monks also used blank spaces in the manuscript to record details of property transactions in the late eleventh and twelfth centuries.

One of the things I particularly enjoyed about the \\"Forensic Casebook of Crime\\" was his inclusion of cases by other favorite authors, Sir Sidney Smith (\\"Mostly Murder\\") and Dr. Keith Simpson (\\"Forty Years of Murder\\") who themselves were highly respected forensic pathologists in early and mid-20th century Britain.  I highly recommend their books, as Sir Sidney and Dr. Simpson were the original investigators for many of Great Britain's most shocking crimes.<br /><br />The first edition of \\"Forensic Casebook of Crime\\" was published in 2000, so John Sanders not only had the advantage of being able to pick and choose among Sir Sidney and Dr. Simpson's cases, he is also able to write about many of the great advances in forensic technology toward the end of the 20th Century, including what he calls \\"DNA--The New Wonder Detection Kit.\\"<br /><br />DNA testing was first used to convict a criminal was a 1987 burglary/rape, but the most famous use of DNA was its starring role in the capture of serial murderer-rapist, Colin Pitchfork.

His book is a good mix of the famous and obscure successes of forensic pathologists, including a few stories where no crime was even involved.  His lead story, \\"The Corpse That Cried\\" recounts the story of the woman who was certified as dead by the police doctor, but when the pathologist, Dr. Benstead arrived on the scene (a cold stretch of beach) an hour later, he was definitely puzzled.  \\"Of the three cardinal signs of death, algor (cooling), rigor (stiffening) and livor (staining) he could see only algor.\\"  Nevertheless he had her taken to the morgue, and as he was examining the corpse, he saw \\"a tiny tear trickle out of one of its eyes and roll down its cheek.\\"<br /><br />The woman was rushed to the hospital and revived from her deep hypothermia and the overdose of barbiturates that she had taken, and thus became one of the very few 'patients' seen by a pathologist who lived to tell her tale.<br /><br />\\"Forensic Casebook of Crime\\" is pithy and interesting, and I would definitely recommend it as a supplement to the classics, \\"Forty Years of Murder\\" and \\"Mostly Murder.\\"nly algor.\\"  Nevertheless he had her taken to the morgue, and as he was examining the corpse, he saw \\"a tiny tear trickle out of one of its eyes and roll down its cheek.\\" <br /> <br />The woman was rushed to the hospital and revived from her deep hypothermia and the overdose of barbiturates that she had taken, and thus became one of the very few 'patients' seen by a pathologist who lived to tell her tale. <br /> <br />\\"Forensic Casebook of Crime\\" is pithy and interesting, and I would definitely recommend it as a supplement to the classics, \\"Forty Years of Murder\\" and \\"Mostly Murder.\\" <br />	2005-08-22

The ancient (\\"Ah, if I were only ninety again...\\") Master Li and his faithful sidekick and beast of burden, Number Ten Ox set out to investigate the brutal death of a monk in the Valley of Sorrows in this second volume of Hughart's fantasy trilogy.<br /><br />The monk appears to have died of fright in the monastery library, a scrap of forged manuscript clutched in his hand, and a very unmonkish dinner of thousand-year-old eggs and other expensive delicacies in his belly (Master Li performs an autopsy that would make Dr. G. proud).<br /><br />The chief suspect is the infamous Laughing Prince.  Unfortunately (actually, fortunately for the peasants whom he murdered in droves) the sadistic prince has been dead for over 700 years.  Master Li and Number Ten Ox descend into the tomb of the evil prince, along with his painterly descendent, Prince Liu Pao where they find jade-encased mummies, mad Monks of Mirth, a water slide that wouldn't be out of place at Disney World, and of course, treasure and torture chambers.  The one thing they don't find is the corpse of the Laughing Prince.<br /><br />At least, not right away.<br /><br />Master Li must call upon his friends, old, new, dead, immortal, and immoral to solve the mystery of the Laughing Prince and the Stone of Immortality.  You will meet characters in this book who are to be found nowhere else in fiction, including the beautiful Moon Boy who sings and buggers his way through the ten principal Hells and the great Wheel of Reincarnation, acting as a sort of Virgil to Master Li's Dante.<br /><br />The plot is complicated, but the characters and the mythical scenery of an ancient China that never was make \\"The Story of the Stone\\" a fantasy to read and reread in those dark hours when you don't think you can stand another page of the noble Frodo.

The vast majority of her works were created as follows:  \\"first, the drawing was made with a hard #2 drawing pencil; then water colors were applied with a #4 brush made from marten hair; palm and fingers were then used to 'daub' the paint; and finally whiting was added where necessary.\\"<br /><br />For those of us who are primarily interested in her use of color, a major part of her work unfortunately remains in the black-and-white stage. This book has 31 full-page color reproductions, and eight of those that lack color other than a delicate sepia and gray with white highlights.<br /><br />The editor, David Larkin advances the notion that Sulamith W&uuml;lfing was not primarily a fantasist as were Rackham and Dulac.  She was born in 1901 into a very spiritual German family (her father was a Theosophist) and \\"her earliest memories include seeing the angels, 'gnomes' and small, delicate creatures which have always populated her drawings.\\"<br /><br />My own preference is for her fairy tale illustrations such as the \\"The Saving from the Little Mermaid\\" which is tinted with the muted rainbows of mother-of-pearl.  Her Madonnas and Holy Families seem a bit stiffer, more gorgeously robed, rather in the style of Byzantine mosaics.<br /><br />For close to seventy years, Sulamith W&uuml;lfing created works of extreme beauty, using the delicate palette of the aurora, the interiors of sea shells, the pure glints of a glacier's interior.  Rackham also used this Northern palette but his drawings were more restless, some with the ferocity of a stormy sea. W&uuml;lfing draws on the calmer, deeper vein of a Midsummer's Eve.  Flowers and strangely beautiful reptiles abound. Mysterious knights meet gorgeously robed maidens by the light of the evening star.  A mermaid floats peacefully, eyes closed, in the foamy arms of the sea.<br /><br />You'll have to decide for yourself which of Sulamith W&uuml;lfing's styles you like best.

The rumor that Lord Severn's expedition has been cursed sprang up after the death of one of its scientists by scorpion bite.

It's the overnight guests and family who experience the other inhabitants of this gloomy, massively constructed castle.  For starters, it's reputed to be the place where Macbeth murdered King Duncan in 1040.  In one of the tower rooms, Lord 'Beardie' Crawford drinks and dices with the Devil until Judgement Day.  Then there was the monster born into the family and locked in a secret room that was built in the latter part of the seventeenth century.  Supposedly the secret of this room is passed down from the Lord to his heir, and the Queen's great-grandfather, the twelfth Earl, \\"was quoted as saying: 'If you could only guess the nature of the secret, you would go down on your knees and thank God it was not yours!'\\"<br /><br />If you do make a trip to Glamis Castle, count the windows (reputedly a favorite pastime of Prince Charles) and see if you can spot the extra one from the outside that leads to the secret chamber (although I doubt whether the current management will let you hang scarves from the 'regular' windows.)e from the outside that leads to the secret chamber (although I doubt whether the current management will let you hang scarves from the 'regular' windows.) <br />	2005-08-17

Well, there are a smattering of ghosts, but mainly the reader is treated to stories about witches and grave robbers.  The key word in the title is 'Historic.'  The authors have compiled these stories from the walking tours that they have been conducting \\"round the dark and sinister wynds and closes of the old town of Edinburgh\\" since 1984.  According to the blurb on the back cover, the authors are the directors of Mercat Tours, and are \\"historians by training and teachers by profession.\\"<br /><br />I guess 'ghosts and ghouls' just makes for a juicier title than 'witches and grave robbers.'<br /><br />As for witches in Scotland a so-called 'pact' with the Devil was sufficient to incur the death penalty.  Between 1563 and 1736, more than 4,400 'witches' died at the stake, which is more than four times the number that were put to death in England where the law required a proof of injury to people or domestic animals.<br /><br />Edinburgh seems to have played a major role in the interpretation of Exodus XXII verse 18:  \\"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.\\"  The persecutions really took off when a coven of witches supposedly attempted to drown James VI, King of the Scots as he returned from Denmark with his new bride.<br /><br />King James VI took a keen interest in the witch hunt, personally interrogating a notable Edinburgh sorcerer, Doctor Fian who began his career as a schoolmaster and later took on a job with 'Auld Clootie' as his 'clerk and registrar of witches.'  The Prince of Darkness did nothing to prevent his faithful employee's death at the stake.<br /><br />The teaching of medicine at Edinburgh University required subjects for dissection, and prior to the Anatomy Act of 1832, professors obtained most of their bodies from their enterprising students and certain freelance operators who were not above creating their own corpses from the living.  Occasionally, as occurred at the Grayfriars Kirkyard, the body snatchers performed an accidental act of mercy by digging up someone who had been buried alive.<br /><br />There are a smattering of ghost stories to leaven an otherwise grim history of Scotland's capital city.

Oddly enough, they are not fertility figures.  Most of them are portrayed as ferocious and gaunt, with the ribs clearly delineated.  Here is one of the earliest references to a Sheela found at Barnahealy, County Cork:  \\"This is one of those old Fetish figures often found in Ireland on the fronts of churches as well as castles, they are called 'Hags of the Castle' and when placed above the keystone of the door arch were supposed to possess a tutelary or protective power so that an enemy passing by would be disarmed of evil intent against the building on seeing it.\\"<br /><br />Typically in Gaelic oral traditions, a central character in many of the stories was a fearsome female figure, typically described as \\"an old woman with a bald head, cadaverous ribs, sagging abdomen, and small flat breasts.\\"  She is the crone, the third aspect of the Earth goddess which also includes a maiden and a woman in her sexual prime.<br /><br />It is rather delightful to think that the Sheela-na-Gigs migrated from Celtic mythology into Christian iconography and could be found perched above many a monastery or church door where generations of monks filed under her, protected (although they may not have known it) from the evil eye by an exaggerated carving of  female pudenda.  It's a pity that more recent churchmen (especially since the Reformation and most especially since Victorian times) were more prudish than their early counterparts and destroyed or hid many of these Sheelas.<br /><br />This book contains drawings of all known Sheela-na-Gigs of Ireland and Britain, and also figures that might be related to them.  The authors also list a website where further research on Sheela-Na-Gigs is being published:  jharding.demon.co.uk.<br /><br />You might want to plan your next trip to Britain or Ireland to include viewings of these fascinating, archaic Divine Hags.Britain, and also figures that might be related to them.

Courtney Davis has published over 50 books on Celtic art, including coloring books and books of Viking and Celtic tattoos.<br /><br />\\"101 Celtic Illuminated Letters\\" is a source book of decorated initials from some of the most celebrated thousand-year-old Celtic manuscripts, including the Book of Kells and the Lindisfarne Gospels.<br /><br />After a brief introduction, the letters are arranged one to a page, the black-and-white version facing its counterpart colored by Courtney Davis.  The letters average around 3.5 to 4 inches high, and are very easy to size up or down using a grid (not supplied).<br /><br />Beauty is combined with humor in the letters of the Celtic Dog Alphabet, and there are also birds and human faces worked into some of the illuminated letters.

These are demons like you've never seen before.  For instance, the first demon-deity \\"resembles a three-year-old child with red eyes, long ears, and beautiful hair, and it kills by forcing its victims to strangle themselves.\\"<br /><br />Luckily Master Li happens upon Number Ten Ox before he finishes choking himself to death.<br /><br />The plot is quite complicated, but the exotic settings and oddball characters kept this reader mightily entertained.  In addition to the 'Eight Skilled Gentlemen,' there is a very old, partially deaf Celestial Master and saint who has some of the best lines in the book:  at the funeral of a demon-slain high muckety-muck minister of state, he glares at a row of tight-lipped mandarins, and shouts, \\"Damn fools!...If you'd given Ma's corpse an enema you could have buried what remained in a walnut shell!\\"<br /><br />Chinese saints seem to be much more opinionated and interesting than their European counterparts.<br /><br />Master Li and Number Ten Ox join up with a puppeteer and his beautiful daughter to break up a ring of mandarin smugglers who are using mysterious cages to communicate with one another.  The story finally resolves itself in a wild end-of-the-world dragon boat race that pits our two heroes against the gods.<br /><br />I only wish Barry Hughart had continued on with this eccentric and wonderful myth of old China.sh Barry Hughart had continued on with this eccentric and wonderful myth of old China.	2005-08-11

Now that we live up in the woods, we're in bird paradise.  Using this Peterson Field Guide for \\"Eastern Birds\\" plus a good pair of binoculars for visual identifications, and the \\"Birding by Ear Eastern/Central\\" CDs (Richard K. Walton and Robert W. Lawson) I've identified 42 species of birds in just over a month, as a casual observer for the Michigan Breeding Bird Atlas II project.<br /><br />I have other bird books, but it is Peterson's Field Guide that I use most frequently.  Roger Tory Peterson's 'system' \\"is based on patternistic drawings with arrows that pinpoint the key field marks.\\"  You don't have to have the bird in hand in order to make an identification.  In addition to 136 full-color plates of Eastern birds (male, female, and immature, or summer and winter plumage if they differ markedly), there are also 390 three-color maps (first introduced in the 1980 edition).<br /><br />The maps are absolutely essential for an amateur like me.  If I've narrowed down a blurry little gray bird to X and Y, and Y never makes it north of the Mason-Dixon Line, I can be pretty certain that the bird is X.  Here's an actual example on the utility of the maps:  I was trying to distinguish a trilling song that could either belong to the Swamp Sparrow, the Pine Warbler, or the Northern Junco.  We do see Juncos at our feeders in the winter, but this is July and according to Peterson's map, the Juncos spend the summer north of here, mostly in Canada.  So I've narrowed the trill down to the Swamp Sparrow or the Pine Warbler (actually I'm positive we've got both as I've made tentative visual identifications.  It makes sense since we live in the Pine Barrens which is dotted with numerous swamps).<br /><br />This book begins with a generalized introduction to identifying birds by shape, distinctive features and behavior.  Physically, it is tightly bound and just the right size to slip into a backpack.  The pages are glossy and 'relatively' waterproof if you wipe them quickly dry.  There is even a 'life list' up front where you can check off the birds you have seen.<br /><br />Don't go birding without it.slip into a backpack.

I can't imagine Dr. Zinsser's grumpily discursive, masterfully written, and ultimately profound biography of typhus fever ever going completely out of print.<br /><br />Stylistically the only work I can compare it to is Gibbon's \\"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\\". Where Gibbon occasionally dipped his pen in vinegar and excoriated the Christians, Zinsser dips his pen in hydrochloric acid and savages all of the quaint human customs that have kept Typhus alive and thriving.<br /><br />He shows much more affectionate sympathy for the louse than he does for the General or the Politician.<br /><br />In the interests of research, Zinsser carried pill boxes of lice under his socks for weeks at a time before taking \\"advantage of them for scientific purposes.\\"  He is not able to tear himself away from these little creatures and address the true subject of his biography, i.e. the typhus germ, until Chapter 12!<br /><br />However, the journey to Chapter 12 is well worth taking because along the way, Zinsser wittily savages modern biographers, psychoanalysis, astronomers and physicists who \\"scamper back to God\\" (Biologists evidently are much less prone to being 'born again'), and of course, all of the wars that have given Typhus countless opportunities to murder lice and humans alike.<br /><br />\\"Rats, Lice, and History\\" should be required reading for would-be writers for its style, would-be Generals for its lessons on how soldiers really die, and for anyone else who is interested in a passionate, eminently witty, one-of-a-kind history of medicine.	2005-07-17

The first two concern the adventures of Simon Tregarth, and the third, \\"Year of the Unicorn\\" is a stand-alone fantasy set in the Dales of High Hallack.<br /><br />As the first fantasy, \\"Witch World\\" (1963) begins, Simon Tregarth, who worked his way up to Lieutenant-Colonel on the battlefields of World War II, is a hunted man, unjustly cashiered from the U.S. Army for dealing in the post-war blackmarket.  Since Simon had been labeled as a crook, he figured he might as well play the game.<br /><br />After seven years in the underworld, surrounded by his enemies and a gunshot away from death, Simon treats himself to a decent last meal (Andre Norton heroes and heroines NEVER whine.  They assess the odds, then keep on slogging).  Enter the mysterious Doctor Petronius who persuades Simon that he has nothing to lose by vanishing from his enemies' gunsights through the Siege Perilous, a Cornish megalith that is rumored to be a gate to other worlds.  Simon leaves the restaurant with Petronius, almost positive that he is walking into a trap. Instead of the bullet he is expecting, our hero is transported to the foggy moors of a new world.<br /><br />The action doesn't let up.  The first thing Simon does is rescue a witch from a nasty bunch of snake-headed dogs and hunters (we don't learn the witch's name until the very end of the book).  The next thing he knows, he's embroiled in a war where the good guys appear to be losing.<br /><br />Simon allies himself with \\"a tall, proud-walking race with...the carriage of rulers and an odd weight of years upon them.\\"  His new home, medieval Estcarp is a matriarchate, ruled by witches, whose powers depend on their continuing virginity.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Simon falls in love with the witch he rescued.<br /><br />The enemies that he and Estcarp must confront have invaded Witch World via a gate similar to the Siege Perilous.  The alien Kolder are technically advanced, with submarines and mind-control devices that they use to command their zombie soldiers.<br /><br />Estcarp's only allies are the Sulcarmen, seafaring warriors and traders who lose their main port of Gorm to the Kolder.

Thematically, both WW and WWW will seem very familiar to fans of the late, great Andre Norton: a conflict between technically advanced, but soulless aliens, and courageous, sword-wielding men and women, who are attempting to make one last stand against the Powers of Evil.<br /><br />Simon Tregarth and his witch-wife, Jaelithe once again find themselves in combat with the alien Kolder, who invaded Witch World through a gateway from their own dying planet.  The Kolder were temporarily stymied in WW, but Simon and his fellow warriors know that they must somehow close the gate between worlds before there will truly be an end to the alien evil.<br /><br />Witch-ruled Estcarp must do battle with her own neighbors as well as the aliens.  Yvian of Karsten declares open war against the witches, and they in turn believe that he has somehow been tainted by the Kolder.  The Hounds of Alizon, seething with hatred against all things magical must also be tamed.<br /><br /> The third fantasy, \\"Year of the Unicorn\\" (1965) is a grand adventure, a love story, a coming-of-age novel set like a jewel amidst the fantastical Dark and Light of Norton's Witch World. `Unicorn' veers away from the `mainstream' Witch World adventures of the Tregarth family, but it is perfect in its own setting: the Wastes and Dales of High Hallack.<br /><br />Each setting, each character is illuminated with clear description and color, like scenes from a medieval Book of Hours.  Even though I first read this book in 1965, I can still close my eyes and see Gillan and the ancient Dame Alousan gathering herbs in the high-walled garden of Norstead Abbey.  I can see the twelve and one high-born maids riding forth from the Abbey - the twelve and one maids who were promised as brides to the Were-riders of the Waste.<br /><br />The heroine, Gillan realizes that she is not meant for the quiet life of her vowed companions.  She possesses a magic that is forbidden to the goodly Dames, and a restless curiosity that is stifled behind the stone walls of the Abbey.  And so she rides forth, disguised as the bride who had threatened to kill herself rather than marry a Were-rider.  In order to survive, Gillan must rely on her unschooled magic to separate illusion from reality, and true love from the snarling masks of the Were Pack.<br /><br />Lifetime Grand Master of Fantasy, Andre Norton built well.  There are 35 Witch World (WW) fantasies, and the count is probably still rising even though this author passed away on March 17, 2005.  Many of the later WW novels were collaborations, and it wouldn't surprise me if her co-authors attempt to live on in the world that the Grand Master created.

I've only had that experience once in my life and my dream took place in Andre Norton's Witch World.<br /><br />This author kept me turning the pages, not only for the cliff-hangers that the hero, Simon Tregarth gets himself into, but also for glimpses of a strange new, magical landscape.  She doesn't pile on the adjectives, either.  Her prose is remarkably clean.  Just read the lead sentence of \\"Witch World,\\" which introduces us to ex-soldier, Simon Tregarth:<br /><br />\\"The rain was a slantwise curtain across the dingy street, washing soot from city walls, the taste of it metallic on the lips of the tall, thin man who walked with a loping stride close to the buildings, watching the mouths of doorways, the gaps of alleys with a narrow-eyed intentness.\\"<br /><br />He is a hunted man, unjustly cashiered from the U.S. Army for dealing in the post-war blackmarket.  Since Simon had been labeled as a crook, he figured he might as well play the game.<br /><br />After seven years in the underworld, surrounded by his enemies and a gunshot away from death, Simon treats himself to a decent last meal (Andre Norton heroes and heroines NEVER whine.  They assess the odds, then keep on slogging).  Enter the mysterious Doctor Petronius who persuades Simon that he has nothing to lose by vanishing from his enemies' gunsights through the Siege Perilous, a Cornish megalith that is rumored to be a gate to other worlds.  Simon leaves the restaurant with Petronius, almost positive that he is walking into a trap. Instead of the bullet he is expecting, our hero is transported to the foggy moors of a new world.<br /><br />The action doesn't let up.  The first thing Simon does is rescue a witch from a nasty bunch of snake-headed dogs and hunters (we don't learn the witch's name until the very end of the book).  The next thing he knows, he's embroiled in a war where the good guys appear to be losing.<br /><br />Simon allies himself with \\"a tall, proud-walking race with...the carriage of rulers and an odd weight of years upon them.\\"  His new home, medieval Estcarp is a matriarchate, ruled by witches, whose powers depend on their continuing virginity.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Simon falls in love with the witch he rescued.<br /><br />The enemies that he and Estcarp must confront have invaded Witch World via a gate similar to the Siege Perilous.  The alien Kolder are technically advanced, with submarines and mind-control devices that they use to command their zombie soldiers.<br /><br />Estcarp's only allies are the Sulcarmen, seafaring warriors and traders who lose their main port of Gorm to the Kolder.  Simon, his friend Koris of Gorm, the witch he rescued from the Hounds of Alizon, and a youthful soldier called 'Briant' tread the mysterious byways of Estcarp and its warring neighbors, in an attempt to track down and destroy the technically superior aliens.<br /><br />Lifetime Grand Master of Fantasy, Andre Norton built well.

The plot is complicated and exceptionally bloody for one of Norton's novels, but she weaves most of the plot together in the end--leaving just enough unfinished business with Alizon, the sea-faring Sulcar, Karsten, and Estcarp to bewitch the reader through many more novels.<br /><br />Originally, Norton intended to make Witch World live for only one book. But she says, \\"once [Witch World} was finished I was plagued by more and more questions that arose in my own mind about the past, present and future of that world.\\"<br /><br />As the Witch World books continued, they became less and less technical and more and more magical.

But what a trilogy this is!  The first installment, \\"Bridge of Birds\\" was co-winner (with Robert Holdstock's \\"Mythago Wood\\") of the 1994 World Fantasy Award, and also won the 1986 Mythopoeic Award.  The final two books in the 'Master Li' trilogy are \\"The Story of the Stone,\\" and \\"Eight Skilled Gentlemen.\\"<br /><br />This fantasy of an ancient China that (alas) never was could almost have been written by Patricia McKillip, except for the dollops of raucous humor that spice up the shining fairy tale.  But the beauty and wonder of McKillip's fantasies are here, as viewed through the smoke of an opium dream.<br /><br />Here are the two main characters in their own words:<br /><br />\\"My family is quite undistinguished, and since I am the tenth of my father's sons and rather strong I am usually referred to as Number Ten Ox.\\"<br /><br />\\"My surname is Li and my personal name is Kao, and there is a slight flaw in my character,\\" says the drunken old man who, seventy-eight years past \\"had been awarded first place among all the scholars of China.\\"<br /><br />(In the first draft of this book, Master Li was nineteen years old, and Number Ten Ox only made a brief appearance as a village idiot!)<br /><br />This unlikely pair sets out to rescue a village of children who lie in poisoned comas brought about by the greedy village pawnbrokers, Fang and Ma the Grub.<br /><br />Master Li and Number Ten Ox learn that they must find the Great Root of Power (the Mother of All Ginseng) in order to save the children, but as with all quests, there are many obstacles along the way, including murderous monks, a bandit called Cut-Off-Their-Balls Wang, and an ex-Imperial concubine called The Ancestress, who poisoned the emperor and bankrupted the empire \\"by decreeing that every leaf that fell in her imperial pleasure garden must be replaced by an artificial leaf fashioned from the costliest silk.\\"  But they are all minor villains compared to the tiger-masked, immortal Duke of Ch'in.  He is so evil he manages to upset the balance of Heaven, which Master Li and Number Ten Ox must restore before they can save poisoned children.<br /><br />This might sound like a complicated plot, but your imagination will be so happily reveling in the exotic settings, the oddball characters, and the stories within stories, that it will seem like you're skimming through this book, as easily as Master Li and Number Ten Ox skim across the ancient Chinese landscape (that never was) in their Bamboo Dragonfly.tificial leaf fashioned from the costliest silk.\\"  But they are all minor villains compared to the tiger-masked, immortal Duke of Ch'in.

The editor, Lamar Underwood has selected seventeen harrowing excerpts from books and articles grouped under the titles, \\"Terrorist Attacks,\\" \\"The Crucible of Fire: Tragedy, Escape, and Remembrance,\\" \\"Natural Causes: When Time and Luck Run Out,\\" \\"Disaster at Sea: Victims, Heroes, and Doomed Voyages,\\" and \\"The Hand of Man: Of Failure and Catastrophe.\\"  He does a masterful job of bringing you in, up close and personal.  I don't think you'll be able to shield yourself from the horror of the victims' plights, most especially in last section of this book:  \\"Flights that Failed:  Aviation's Darkest Hours.\\"<br /><br />It was not a good idea to read this book a week before I plan to fly to London.  I most especially recommend that you do NOT read \\"The Greatest Disaster Stories Ever Told\\" while actually seated on a plane.<br /><br />I had already read a couple of the books that Underwood used as sources, and so I can personally testify that he did a tremendous job of selecting the most frightening, heart-wrenching parts of \\"Isaac's Storm\\" and \\"The Johnstown Flood\\" to include in his anthology.<br /><br />Don't be surprised if you find yourself searching out the editor's original book selections, in order to discover the ultimate fate of the victims.  I need to find Arthur Weingarten's book, \\"The Sky is Falling\\" (1977 - Grosset & Dunlap), excerpted here, to learn the outcome of a day in New York City in 1945 that foreshadowed 9/11--the day that a B-25 bomber crashed into the Empire State Building.<br /><br />Weingarten's account of an elevator operator who hurtled 76 stories down into the basement of the Empire State Building, after the six braided steel cables of her elevator were sliced through by the B-25's engine, which then broke through the elevator's roof, is especially terrifying (Claustrophobes, do not read this story!):  \\"Out of the corner of her eye she caught sight of the red lights flashing on the panel indicator.  76...75...74...The numbers were running into a vertical blur...she flung herself across the car, raising her hands above her head to ward off the flaming debris that poured through the hole in the roof.\\"<br /><br />What provisions were made for the victims of the Bhopal Catastrophe?<br /><br />What was the ultimate fate of the survivors of the 'Lusitania' and the 'U.S.S.

I've been listening to the predecessor of \\"More Birding by Ear,\\" i.e. \\"Birding by Ear (Eastern and Central North America)\\" for over a year now, and the music-processing regions in my brain are finally sorting the symphony of bird song in the woods and swamps around our house into individual melodies.  I strongly recommend that you start with Walton and Lawson's \\"Birding by Ear\\" as it has recorded the songs and calls of eighty-five common species.  \\"More Birding by Ear\\" provides recordings of ninety-six additional Eastern and Central North American species, many of them, such as the shore birds, not often heard outside of their specialized habitats.<br /><br />For most people, bird calls may produce nothing more than a song that is hard to get out of the head.  These two three-CD sets will help them make sense of those songs.  I was so encouraged by the calls I had learned from these CDs that I signed up as a volunteer for the Michigan Breeding Bird Atlas. So far I've identified forty-one birds in my 'priority block,' many of them by song alone.<br /><br />I don't know whether I'll actually ever see a Red-eyed Vireo, an Oven Bird, or a Veery but I hear them almost every day now, calling from the forest canopy or deep in the swamp, or echoing eerily down the river at dusk.<br /><br />Yet oddly enough, once I've identified a bird call on the CD, such as \\"More Birding by Ear's\\" Yellow-bellied Sapsucker, I begin to see Yellow-bellied Sapsuckers everywhere.  Location by song must be giving my eyes a kick start.  Now I'm beginning to suspect they're one of the commonest woodpeckers in our neighborhood!<br /><br />The narrative that accompanies the bird song on these CDs will both entertain and inform you.  Who will ever be able to forget the song of the Olive-Sided Flycatcher once it is translated into the catch-phrase, \\"Quick, three beers!\\"<br /><br />If you're serious about your birding, and want to identify birds by song, as well as by binoculars and field guides, these CDs are priceless.uides, these CDs are priceless. <br />	2005-07-12

If you think romantically instead of using Carr's carefully scattered clues and logically deducing who poisoned Marcus Chesney on a stage in front of witnesses, you'll have the solution right away.  Otherwise, this mystery could prove to be quite a challenge.<br /><br />Carr's serial detective, the humungous Dr. Gideon Fell doesn't show up until halfway through the book, and three poisoned corpses have already littered the landscape.  One of the victims is a little boy who was done in by candy from the local tobacconist's shop.  The other two murders occur in the house where, according to local gossip, the child killer lives.<br /><br />The chief suspect certainly doesn't do herself any favors when she is seen trying to buy poison by the Scotland Yard inspector who is assigned to the case.  Earlier in the story, she is also spotted asking the little boy who was poisoned to exchange some candy for her at the tobacconist's shop.  I guess if I had been one of the locals, I would have thrown stones at her, too.<br /><br />The main drawback to this book's readability is the artificial nature of the second murder.  How believable is it to have someone set the stage for his own murder, just to prove that eyewitnesses are unreliable?  He even writes out a questionnaire for his audience to fill out after his staged murder (which turns out to be real).<br /><br />Of course Marcus Chesney didn't really expect to get murdered.  He was so insufferable about proving the unreliability of eyewitnesses that he made it easier rather than more difficult for the poisoner to strike again.<br /><br />There really wasn't anyone to like in this book except for Inspector Elliott.  All of the other characters were either intellectually arrogant, pompous, obsequious, or hysterical.  If you enjoy watching Dr. Fell sorting through his bag of tricks, i.e. snorting, wheezing, coyly hinting, and asking mysterious questions, then enjoy, enjoy.  \\"The Problem of the Green Capsule\\" has one of John Dickson Carr's most ingenious plots--except for romantics like me.ugh his bag of tricks, i.e. snorting, wheezing, coyly hinting, and asking mysterious questions, then enjoy, enjoy.  \\"The Problem of the Green Capsule\\" has one of John Dickson Carr's most ingenious plots--except for romantics like me. <br />	2005-07-10

The endpaper is a complex decorative motif of leaves and flowers, in rose and beige tones.  The vignettes were a little disappointing:  small and colored in rose tones.  I was expecting the images to be bigger and a bit less monochrome.<br /><br />However, this is a very sturdy journal.  Front and cover qualify as hardbound and there is a double-spiral wire holding the pages together.  Facing pages contain one blank sheet (except for a small decorative motif top and bottom) and one lined sheet to record your thoughts.  The paper is heavy enough so you could do pencil and possibly even ink drawings on the blank page.  I wouldn't recommend water colors.	2005-07-08

Ressler left the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit twelve years ago to venture into private practice as a criminologist. He retired with thirty years of investigative experience (ten with the U.S. Army's CID and twenty with the FBI, many of them as director of the FBI's Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (VICAP)).  This book is one of his many attempts to speak from the belly of the monster that has devoured him...in fact the book that follows this one is actually called \\"I Have Lived in the Monster.\\"<br /><br />\\"Out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice.\\"  (Jonah 2:2)<br /><br />So what does our modern-day prophet, Robert K. Ressler cry out of the belly of the beast?<br /><br />Credit for coining the phrase \\"serial killer\\" is commonly (and mistakenly) given to Ressler, one of the founding members of the FBI's elite Behavioral Science Unit.  Along with his colleague John Douglas, Ressler also served as a model for the character 'Jack Crawford' in Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lecter trilogy.<br /><br />\\"Whoever Fights Monsters\\" is subtitled \\"My Twenty Years Tracking Serial Killers for the FBI\\" and if you read true crime books, you will recognize many of the monsters that Ressler describes and interviews.  A miscellaneous look at the photo captions will give you an idea of whose minds he attempted to probe:<br /><br />* \\"One of two blenders used by the Sacramento 'Vampire Killer'... to prepare human blood and organs for ingesting to 'stop his blood from turning to powder'\\"<br /><br />* \\"Tattoos on the arm of Richard Speck, which led to his arrest in the murders of eight women in Chicago in 1966\\"<br /><br />* \\"Photograph taken of the leg of a Brudos victim.  This captures the essence of his bizarre fetish fantasies--women's feet in high-heeled shoes\\"<br /><br />A well-known review service complains that \\"as deeply as Ressler gets into killers' heads...he refused to reveal much of his own here, offering no explanation ... for why he's devoted his life to a calling so dire and soul-wearing...\\"<br /><br />Actually, I believe Ressler reveals quite a bit of himself in his books.  I read him as a man who is easy to admire, but hard to like.  I'm sure some of the other law enforcement officers who had to work with him found his techniques and pronouncements a bit grating. They might have also gotten the notion that he was hogging the limelight.  Ressler does not keep quiet about crime scenes where he thinks the cops screwed up, and uses the 'fiasco' of Henry Lucas's murder confessions as an example of bad police work.  Two reporters working for the \\"Dallas Times\\" finally did the spadework on Lucas's stories and determined that he couldn't possibly have killed the hundreds of the victims he claimed to have done in.  Sometimes he wasn't even physically in the state, e.g. Florida, when the victim was murdered.  By the time the dust had settled, and Ressler interviewed Lucas, the con admitted that he had killed \\"fewer than ten, perhaps five.\\"<br /><br />One of the services that I wouldn't trust anyone but Ressler (and maybe a few others) to perform is to interview serial killers and determine the 'how' and 'why' of what they did.  Ressler describes a few cases where his testimony tipped the balance as to whether a former killer who has served his time, should be paroled.  It seems as though the psychopathic personality is good at fooling parole boards and psychologists by the depth of his remorse, and by his long stretch of sterling behavior in prison (during his first incarceration, John Wayne Gacy started up a prison branch of the JayCees)---but the psychopath doesn't fool Ressler at all.  He's gotten into the hearts and minds of too many of them.<br /><br />One of the definitions of 'prophet' is \\"a person gifted with profound moral insight and exceptional powers of expression...a predictor; a soothsayer.\\"<br /><br />We may not want to listen to this prickly prophet Ressler, who speaks of demons in our midst, and who predicts their behavior if they are sent back out into society.  But for the sake of our loved ones and friends, we really should listen.f demons in our midst, and who predicts their behavior if they are sent back out into society.

The images are \\"Wonder in Snow\\" (a baby asleep inside of a purple crocus),\\"Christmas Tree\\" (two lovers embracing under a tree decorated with silver ornaments), \\"The Angel of Advent\\" (two angel-figures lighting candles), \\"The Great Ball\\" (two children with outsize Christmas ornaments and strange little gnomes), \\"Holiday Swing\\" (a girl sits in a swing made of outsize Christmas ornaments), and \\"Crown of Light\\" ( a girl wearing a crown of candles).<br /><br />All of the pictures are done in muted aurora-like colors on glossy stock and the decorative motif is continued on the back of each card:  a peacock's feather, silver ornaments, feathers, or snowflakes.<br /><br />Really, these are some of the most beautiful Christmas cards I've ever seen, and they come in a sturdy cardboard box decorated with the \\"Large Ball\\" image.  Even if I do send out the cards, I'll still have box to keep my miniature Christmas ornaments in.<br /><br />The paintings of Sulamith W&uuml;lfing capture the innocence and eerie Northern beauty of this most pagan of Christian holidays.	2005-07-05

Norton's four-book series about the trader-crew of the 'Solar Queen' ended in 1969 with \\"Postmarked the Stars\\" but beware! Lesser authors have butted into the series, presumably with Norton's permission since this remarkable Gandalf Grand Master of Fantasy and Nebula Grand Master just recently passed away after a long and extremely fruitful career (her first novel was published in 1934, her latest fantasy in 2005).<br /><br />One 'Solar Queen' rip-off to avoid at all costs is \\"Redline: the Stars.\\"<br /><br />Norton's 'Solar Queen' stories are told from the viewpoint of Dane Thorson, an apprentice-Cargo Master who is introduced in \\"Sargasso of Space,\\" the first 'Solar Queen' novel, as a \\"lanky, very young man in an ill-fitting Trader's tunic.\\"  Most of this author's heroes and heroines are young, uncertain of themselves, shy, with a tendency to trip over their own enthusiasms and load themselves up with guilt at the slightest opportunity.  They are very likeable and their adventures are narrated in remarkably lean prose with just the right touch of description.<br /><br />After ten years of schooling, orphan Dane Thorson is assigned via a computer analysis of his psychological profile--not to a safe berth on a sleek Company-run starship that his classmates were vying for--but to a battered tramp of a Free Trader. To say that the 'Solar Queen' \\"lacked a great many refinements and luxurious fittings which the Company ships boasted\\" was an understatement.  But she was a tightly-run ship and what she lacked in refinement, she made up for in adventure.  Dane soon settles in under Cargo Master Van Rycke and learns \\"to his dismay what large gaps unfortunately existed in his training.\\"<br /><br />Sometimes I just want to give Dane a big hug.<br /><br />\\"Plague Ship\\" takes the crew of the 'Solar Queen' to Sargol, where the enigmatic feline natives seem very reluctant to trade away their fabulous scented gemstones.  When Dane Thorson discovers an herb that the Salariki are willing to swap for their gems, he fears that his eagerness to make a trade breakthrough might have poisoned a native child.<br /><br />That becomes the least of his worries when the 'Solar Queen' blasts off from Sargol with invisible, undetectable stowaways that would brand the free traders anathema to all inhabited worlds.<br /><br />In space, the more senior members of the 'Solar Queen's' crew succumb to a strange plague that resembles sleeping sickness.  Dane and his fellow-apprentices, with the assistance of Captain Jellico's Hoobat (a sort of blue parrot-lizard, or at least that's how I've always pictured it) discover the source of the plague: venomous hitch-hikers from Sargol.  \\"It walked erect on two threads of legs...a bulging abdomen sheathed in the horny substance of a beetle's shell ended in a sharp point.\\"  It was only about a foot-and-a-half high and could change color like a chameleon.<br /><br />The Hoobat kills and eats the first creature, and then the hunt is on for others of its kind.<br /><br />Even with the source of the sleeping sickness discovered, the 'Solar Queen's' young apprentices must still convince the rest of the galaxy that they are not a plague ship--and therefore eligible to be destroyed on sight without warning.<br /><br />The 'Solar Queen' novels are prime representatives of Norton's lean action-packed brand of story-telling (at least the ones she solo-authored.)  If you haven't read them since you were a teen-ager, I urge you to try them again.  For a few pleasant hours, you will be immersed in the adventures of a likeable, feisty band of free traders on exotic, carefully-drawn alien worlds.nfortunately existed in his training.\\"   <br />  <br />Sometimes I just want to give Dane a big hug. <br /> <br />\\"Plague Ship\\" takes the crew of the 'Solar Queen' to Sargol, where the enigmatic feline natives seem very reluctant to trade away their fabulous scented gemstones.

I would hate to think that any of these particular criminals are free to kill again.  Ann Rule has selected gruesome cases to include in \\"A Rage to Kill.\\"<br /><br />Fortunately a few of the most vicious killers did not survive their capture.  Unfortunately one of them was never identified, and some of the stories have had to have their body count revised upward.<br /><br />Ann Rule, a former policewoman writes about the victims with a compassion that sometimes ventures over the border into clich&eacute;.  Many are described as stunningly beautiful, innocent, soft-spoken, harmless, well-loved, kindhearted creatures who would certainly have qualified for sainthood if their lives had not been cut tragically short.<br /><br />The killers are more interesting, as in that old Vaudevillian clich&eacute;, \\"the snake has all the lines.\\"  A transvestite prostitute stabs his customer to death when the john discovers his true sex.  A prison official must decide whether this particular killer should be incarcerated with other men or put in a prison for women.  Spree killer Chris Wilder drives one of his victims cross-country, then puts her on a plane back to California instead of murdering her.<br /><br />Rule's homicide detectives are all a heroic blend of hard work, perseverance, and courage.  They do not stand out as individuals as they would if say, Joseph Wambaugh had written this book.  I will remember the murderers in \\"A Rage to Kill\\" much longer than the bland policemen or the saintly victims, because they are the characters upon which Rule lavishes her most original prose.<br /><br />Most of these cases took place in the Seattle area, and only one that I know of has received extensive, nation-wide media attention.  True-crime aficionados will appreciate Ann Rule's meticulous attention to detail, and the extensive contacts with law enforcement officials that give her a unique perspective into each of these ten stories.ith law enforcement officials that give her a unique perspective into each of these ten stories.  <br />	2005-07-03

Almost every county has its own variant, from the Black Shuck of East Anglia to the Bogey Beast of Yorkshire. In this novel, the ghost hound of Herefordshire on the Welsh border foreshadows a death in the Vaughan family.  The family is also cursed with an ancestor named Black Vaughan, who is believed by the author to be the basis for the hellish Hugo of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles.\\"  Did Sir Arthur really take his tale of the phosphorescent Hound from the Welsh Border rather than foggy Dartmoor?<br /><br />According to an article in the 06/01/04 \\"Telegraph,\\" Rickman's theory on the origins of 'The Hound' is about to appear in the magazine \\"Sherlock.\\"<br /><br />Evidently this author discovered that Herefordshire had a population of medieval Baskervilles, not to mention Mortimers and Stapletons, and many local people still refuse to walk near Black Vaughan's home of Hergest Croft at night for fear of seeing his ghost and that of his hound.<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes fans might want to read this book just to ferret out Rickman's research on Arthur Conan Doyle and his most famous dog story.<br /><br />Since \\"The Prayer of the Night Shepherd\\" is also a Merrily Watkins procedural, many familiar characters appear from Rickman's previous novels.  Merrily, Vicar of Ledwardine and Deliverance Consultant to the Diocese of Hereford reluctantly takes on a new role as a healer of physical ailments. Gomer Parry, the manic digger-for-hire who is one of my favorite Rickman creations, has a minor walk-on.  Merrily's daughter Jane is as usual, in the thick of the supernatural goings-on at Stanner Hall.  Poor Lol, the musician is still trying to spend quality time with Merrily, but is thwarted by a snowstorm, a couple of attempted murders, an attempted suicide, and a real murder--not to mention a phantom hound.<br /><br />This book is an unsettling mix of murder mystery, indigestible lumps of Rickman's 'Hound' research, and swirls of supernatural vapor.  What really happened to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle when or if he visited Herefordshire?  What did Jane really experience in the tower room under the witch's hat at Stanner Hall?  What did the medium from the White Company really see?<br /><br />I was left scratching my head over this latest installment of Merrily Watkins's venture into the dim, dangerous netherworld of Anglican theology.ckman's 'Hound' research, and swirls of supernatural vapor.

I put it down several times and had trouble picking it up again.<br /><br />The author had the perfect background for this story:  she and Ted Bundy worked together as volunteers at the Seattle Crisis clinic in 1971; she was already a crime writer, and an ex-cop to boot; she was assigned to work on the case of the mysterious North-west killings long before Bundy was suspected of committing them.  She also belonged to the same sorority (Chi Omega) where Bundy went on his next-to-the-last killing spree in Florida--the case that finally put him on death row.<br /><br />\\"Stranger Beside Me\\" has almost everything you might want to know about Theodore Bundy:  his childhood; the shame he felt because he was illegitimate; his two escapes from prison; the murders he committed and those that he probably committed; the police who were involved in his case; the women who loved him; his court appearances; his confession; his death.<br /><br />However, the book also has a lot you might not want to know about the author:  her bad dreams; her \\"extrasensory awareness of evil or danger\\" in various places connected with Bundy's murders; her feelings about his feelings; her on-again off-again loyalty to Bundy.  There's a great deal of print taken up about how he was really tearing her up inside with all of his alleged wrong-doings, but  I couldn't help wondering if the money she sent to him in prison played a role in his escape to Florida.  I also couldn't help wondering if she stuck with him as long as she did (this is probably totally unfair) because of this book contract.<br /><br />Ann Rule does have a unique insight into the soul (if he had one) of a killer.  This is definitely a one-of-a-kind true crime story.  It's just that I feel it could have been tightened up and cut from 548 pages (the updated twentieth anniversary edition) down to around 350, or so by eliminating the author's personal psycho-dramas.p and cut from 548 pages (the updated twentieth anniversary edition) down to around 350, or so by eliminating the author's personal psycho-dramas. <br />	2005-07-03

She says, \\"As an author who never knew him, I found myself delaying the time when I had to write the end of Scott Scurlock's story...I didn't want him to die.\\"<br /><br />She certainly succeeded in her delaying tactics, but whether her readers will want to follow her to the end on Thanksgiving Day, 1996---speaking for myself, I can't believe I read the whole thing.<br /><br />Some of the delaying tactics Rule used:<br /><br />* Interviewed everyone who came into contact with Scott, and told their life stories, too.<br /><br />* Included the biographies of the policeman and FBI agent who were instrumental in putting a stop to Scott's string of bank robberies.<br /><br />* Interviewed the policemen's wives and colleagues, bank tellers, etc.<br /><br />* Repeated herself over and over again about how beautiful and strong Scott was, how proud he was of his body, and how he could have been a movie star if only he had applied himself.  There's a nude photo of Scott doing press-ups in a chair.  You can judge for yourself.<br /><br />Oh well, this book also includes three more cases from the author's early days as a true crime writer:  \\"The Peeping Tom;\\" \\"The Girl Who Fell in Love with Her Killer;\\" and \\"The Least Likely Suspect.\\"  They at least are worth reading.	2005-07-03

All of these authors embody military ideals such as loyalty and valor into their characters, but also quickly disabuse their readers of any notion of the nobility of war itself.  Their wars are mean and dirty.  Their heroes are the grunts.  Their god is the NCO.<br /><br />In \\"The Better Part of Valor,\\" sequel to \\"Valor's Choice,\\" the heroine, Staff Sergeant Torin Kerr is 'rewarded' for her success on Silsviss, when General Morris detaches her from her platoon of Marines and puts her on a special assignment.<br /><br />The special assignment proves to be a gigantic yellow spaceship of unknown origin, discovered by a salvager who was slightly lost in space at the time.  Both the Confederation and the enemy Others manage to get parties aboard the alien ship, and that's when the fireworks begin.  The ship reads minds and resents having holes blown in its walls.  The latter action on the part of the Confederation scientists wipes out the airlock, plus the whole scientific mission, plus their equipment, save one little old tart-tongued alien.  Luckily, Staff Sergeant Kerr's vain, glory-hogging captain is also rendered unconscious by the blast, so she is in charge.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the bitchy news commentator and her assistant also survive to provide acerbic backchat to every tactic the Staff attempts to get her party of survivors out of the ship.<br /><br />Meanwhile the alien ship keeps reforming itself and throwing the 'Bugs' (Others or servants of the Others) and Kerr's marines together in the race to reach another working airlock.  There are firefights and heroic sacrifices galore.<br /><br />The plot reminds me of an amalgam of several Star Trek and Star Trek NG episodes that could be classified as \\"This Whole Ship is a Trap, Captain!\\" or \\"Didn't we just come down this same corridor a few minutes ago?\\"<br /><br />\\"The Better Part of Valor\\" is a fun read, not nearly as gory as the first book in the series.  The Navy's vacuum jockeys get to zoom around in their fighters and take out Bugs while the Marines battle for the airlock inside the alien ship.<br /><br />There is a slam-bang ending where the glory-hogging captain gets to perform one last valorous deed, even after he is dead.<br /><br />The news commentator survives to tell her story.<br /><br />Staff  Sergeant Kerr--well who knows what happens to her, after her brief fling with the salvage captain?  This book leaves many loose ends, such as the disappearance of the mysterious yellow ship after the Marines manage to break free of her.<br /><br />And how can there not be a sequel when we don't even know who the Others really are?

Attempts at treaty-signing go rapidly south when the mission's aircraft is shot down into a swamp, surrounded by thousands of hormone-crazed adolescent warriors who are bent on improving their tribal status by killing all non-tribesmen.<br /><br />Tanya Huff claims that the climactic battle of \\"Valor's Choice\\" was \\"loosely based on the battle of Rorke's Drift, one of the early battles of the Zulu War.\\"<br /><br />Substitute gigantic, hormonally-out-of-control lizards for Zulu warriors, and you've got \\"Valor's Choice.\\"<br /><br />There are also aliens on the diplomatic team that Staff Sergeant Torin Kerr is shepherding, and aliens in her own platoon of Marines.  The races in the Confederation are divided into those who are totally nonviolent (which include all of the diplomats) and those who do the fighting when it becomes inevitable:  humans;  di-Taykan, gorgeous, hunky elves who are preoccupied with sex 27 galactic-standard-hours-per-day, and who supply most of the bawdy sexual innuendo that is to be found in all Huff novels; and the Krai, gnome-like creatures who eat everything, including their own dead and consider humans a particularly delicious hors-d'oeuvre.<br /><br />The battle itself is long and gory, with lots of opportunity for valor, self-sacrifice, snappy grunt dialogue (Huff excels at this), and a sort of improvise-as-you-go that one might expect from a battle-hardened NCO and her platoon of Marines.

The Kolder were temporarily stymied in WW, but Simon and his fellow warriors know that they must somehow close the gate between worlds before there will truly be an end to the alien evil.<br /><br />Witch-ruled Estcarp must do battle with her own neighbors as well as the aliens.  Yvian of Karsten declares open war against the witches, and they in turn believe that he has somehow been tainted by the Kolder.  The Hounds of Alizon, seething with hatred against all things magical must also be contained.<br /><br />WWW is a book of battles as well as a continuation of the love stories of Simon and Jaelithe, plus pale Loyse and the sea-faring Koris of Gorm.  The plot is complicated and exceptionally bloody for one of Norton's novels, but she weaves most of the story-lines together in the end--leaving just enough unfinished business with Alizon, the sea-faring Sulcar, Karsten, and Estcarp to bewitch the reader through many more novels.<br /><br />Originally, Norton intended to make Witch World live for only one book. But she says, \\"once [Witch World] was finished I was plagued by more and more questions that arose in my own mind about the past, present and future of that world.\\"<br /><br />As the Witch World books continued, they became less and less technical and more and more magical.

Michigan harbors its share of brutal, secretive killers, too.<br /><br />I had seen an episode on 'Cold Case Files' concerning two 'stranger' rape-killings that occurred many years apart in Flint and Romulus Michigan, and before the glory days of DNA.  The killer had also left a bloody partial fingerprint at one of the crime scenes.  \\"Blood Justice\\" delves much more deeply than the T.V. show into the lives and deaths of the victims:  a music professor and an airline stewardess.<br /><br />Unlike Ann Rule, this author does not automatically make saints out of the victims or heroes out of the law enforcement officials.  In fact, a few of the attorneys seem downright incompetent, or more intent on political gain rather than achieving justice.  A few Detroit judges take it on the chin, including 'Half-a-Day' Hathaway.  I had the honor of serving on one of Judge Hathaway's juries, and yes, he did spend portions of the testimony with his eyes closed, but he was a courteous old gentleman and I always made a point of voting for him until he retired.<br /><br />I wish I had served on one of Judge Drake's juries.  She presided over the Jeffrey Gorton case and the author has nothing but admiration for her.  The judge, prosecutor, and most of the jurors were women, which really seemed to freak out the defendant--especially one of the jurors who closely resembled his victims.  Coincidentally, one of the prosecuting attorneys was a former flight attendant.<br /><br />It was the DNA evidence, the partial fingerprint, and dogged police work that finally brought the killer to justice.  Only after the DNA had been matched from the two separate crime scenes many years later did the police realize that the rape/murders were committed by the same man.  The AFIS (fingerprint matching system) had just come on-line in 1986 when Gorton killed his first known victim, but it was not able to make a match against a partial print.  When the partial was sent back to the FBI in 2001, the fingerprint matching system (now called IAFIS) was much improved.

If you think romantically instead of using Carr's carefully scattered clues and logically deducing who poisoned Marcus Chesney on a stage in front of witnesses, you'll have the solution right away.  Otherwise, this mystery could prove to be quite a challenge.<br /><br />Carr's serial detective, the humungous Dr. Gideon Fell doesn't show up until halfway through the book, and three poisoned corpses have already littered the landscape.  One of the victims is a little boy who was done in by candy from the local tobacconist's shop.  The other two murders occur in the house where, according to local gossip, the child killer lives.<br /><br />The chief suspect certainly doesn't do herself any favors when she is seen trying to buy poison by the Scotland Yard inspector who is assigned to the case.  Earlier in the story, she is also spotted asking the little boy who was poisoned to exchange some candy for her at the tobacconist's shop.  I guess if I had been one of the locals, I would have thrown stones at her, too.<br /><br />The main drawback to this book's readability is the artificial nature of the second murder.  How believable is it to have someone set the stage for his own murder, just to prove that eyewitnesses are unreliable?  He even writes out a questionnaire for his audience to fill out after his staged murder (which turns out to be real).<br /><br />Of course Marcus Chesney didn't really expect to get murdered.  He was so insufferable about proving the unreliability of eyewitnesses that he made it easier rather than more difficult for the poisoner to strike again.<br /><br />There really wasn't anyone to like in this book except for Inspector Elliott.

Her work seems to have derived its inspiration from the Victorian Romantic/Fairy Tale illustrators (most particularly Arthur Rackham) and the Pre-Raphaelites.<br /><br />Each delicately tinted illustration in \\"Maidens & Love\\" is accompanied by an appropriate verse by poets such as Alfred Lord Tennyson (\\"Dainty little maiden, whither would you wander?\\") and Sir Walter Scott (\\"What shall be the maiden's fate? / Who shall be the maiden's mate?\\").<br /><br />Gorgeous textiles, jewels, moths, gothic arches surround the inward-looking maidens, their eyes either cast-down or black with atropine-drugged pupils. Their hair floats and curls like pale seaweed. They do not appear to require Earthly nourishment.  Many are madonnas.  All are ethereal.  Long tapering white fingers gently gesture or pray or loiter palely on gorgeously textured robes.<br /><br />I originally bought \\"Maidens & Love\\" as a gift, but after I looked through the illustrations and poems (the book is very small--about 4.5 x 6 inches--rather like one of those inspirational card-sized tomes you can pick up at Hallmark for Mother's Day or Easter), I couldn't decide on a recipient.  Certainly not my nieces, who are too young to realize that such idealized beauty is not worth pining after (I bought one niece an archery set, and the other a book about horses).<br /><br />Finally, I decided to keep the book for myself and enjoy it as art for art's sake.  I might even break out my watercolors and attempt to copy one of W&uuml;lfing's illustrations.  They may not be 'great art' but they are hauntingly beautiful.	2005-06-26

Announcer Chick Anderson's pronouncement that Secretariat was \\"moving like a tremendous machine\\" will surely find its way into Bartlett's.<br /><br />Many of the races that Ed Bowen recounts feature pairs of Thoroughbreds whose names are forever linked by their ferocious competitive spirit:  John Henry and The Bart; Affirmed and Alydar; Kelso and Gun Bow; Swaps and Nashua; Alsab and Whirlaway; Noor and Citation.<br /><br />And speaking of ferocious, the 1933 \\"Fighting Finish\\" Kentucky Derby certainly featured one of the most unruly battles by jockeys.  What with all of the stirrup-grabbing, saddle-cloth-pulling, bumping, and slashing that was going on down the stretch, it's surprising that either Brokers Tip or Head Play finished, much less ran first and second.  Riders Fisher and Meade finished their fight in the jockeys' room, then didn't speak to each other again for some fifteen years after their 'Rodeo' Derby.<br /><br />Bowen doesn't say who won the fight in the jockeys' room.<br /><br />The author is a noted Turf historian who spent nearly three decades with \\"The Blood Horse\\" magazine, which he references quite extensively in these pages.  \\"At the Wire\\" is not a book that will keep you awake all night, in spite of its exciting subject matter.  It is more of a gentle, knowledgeable ramble through 20th century American racing, as exemplified by some of its most courageous and brilliant Thoroughbreds.	2005-06-25

I've created three cards (two valentines and a sympathy card) following her directions and designs, and she is by far the easiest author to understand.  (Incidentally the directions included with the Pergamano parchment craft kit were the most difficult to follow.  Go figure.)<br /><br />In the first chapter of \\"Parchment Craft,\\" the author describes and shows photographs of the materials and equipment you will need to get started in this fifteenth-century art form.  She does not actually list suppliers, but they are easily discovered out on the internet.  (One of my favorites is \\"willascommodities.com\\".)  You really don't need much to start with, just the correct type of paper (which is not really parchment), scissors with short curved blades and fine points (very much like manicure scissors), a pen and white ink for tracing, a couple of pads to place underneath the paper while embossing and perforating, embossing tools (basically knob-ended sticks to use for drawing & rubbing), and needle tools for perforating the paper into fancy patterns.<br /><br />The author suggests tracing all designs on to the parchment with a mapping pen and white ink.  I tried that and found that I was more comfortable with a white Prismacolor pencil, although the resulting lines are not quite as fine.  Embossing is done from the back of the paper, so don't do what I did the first time and also trace onto the back of the paper.  My niece Chelsea's name came out as 'aeslehC.'<br /><br />Many of the directions are illustrated by step-by-step color photographs, especially when the author is demonstrating a new method such as applying color with oil pastels, or using the four-needle tool to make lace.<br /><br />There are many patterns that can be used interchangeably--for instance I copied part of the design from an Easter card for my sympathy card.  However, some of the patterns are not full-sized and you will have to enlarge them on a photocopier before using them.  I wish this step could have been avoided by publishing only full-size patterns, since I no longer have easy access to a copier.  However, this is a minor fault in a very nice book.not full-sized and you will have to enlarge them on a photocopier before using them.

If I were a pregnant Roman, there is one challenge in this treasury of trivia that I would not be able to resist.  According to the author, Nino Lo Bello, no baby has ever been born in the Vatican. (The timing would have to be just right, but here's some mother-to-be's chance to get into the Guinness Book of World Records.)<br /><br />Actually, I was rather surprised that no infants at all had been born in the Vatican since some of the popes were not exactly celibate.  This author mentions a few who had mistresses and children.  He does not skip over the immoral bits, but this book is sweetly gossipy rather than malicious. I can't understand why Vatican officials would have a problem with it.  I mean, it could easily make the reading list in a convent. The anecdote that I found most startling concerned the late Pope John Paul II:  one of the first things he did upon ascending to the Throne of St. Peter was watch back-to-back showings of \\"The Exorcist.\\"<br /><br />Here is a sample of the type of questions you will find answered in this book:<br /><br />* What size shoe did Jesus wear?<br /><br />* Over what did the Vatican go to 'war' with another ministate [San Marino in 1978]?<br /><br />* Which European queen is buried in the Vatican?<br /><br />* Why didn't Sam Snead get his putter blessed by the Pope?<br /><br />* Which U.S. comedian was arrested at the Vatican?<br /><br />Do not neglect to read this book's appendixes, as these are where you will find some of the best anecdotes.  The author relaxes out of the question-and-answer format of the previous 162 pages and tells some very interesting stories.  One of my favorites is \\"John Paul II Gives Galileo a Second Chance.\\"  There is also a fascinating appendix on \\"The Making of a Saint,\\" although this author contradicts John Cornwell (author of \\"Hitler's Pope\\") in some of the particulars, most especially concerning the continuing existence of a \\"Devil's Advocate.\\"<br /><br />Oh, and one of the facts that I thought I knew about the Vatican was firmly contradicted by this author:  Michelangelo did NOT design the uniform for the Swiss Guards, as is stated in all the guide books.  A Vatican seamstress whipped up the colorful costume in 1914 at the request of the Pope.cts that I thought I knew about the Vatican was firmly contradicted by this author:  Michelangelo did NOT design the uniform for the Swiss Guards, as is stated in all the guide books.

The 1991 edition differs from earlier printings in including for the first time the complete version of Carr's essay on detective fiction, \\"The Grandest Game in the World.\\"<br /><br />John Dickson Carr began his professional writing career, at the age of twenty-five, with his Inspector Bencolin mystery novels. However, M. Bencolin first appeared in some of Carr's earlier college stories published in the school newspaper, \\"The Haverfordian.\\"  (It may surprise you to learn that John Dickson Carr was American).  \\"The Door to Doom\\" includes four of those short stories, which began to appear in 1926.  Bencolin is not quite the suave, Mephistophelian character that he becomes in his full-length novels, but his fans will still want to read these stories for Carr's meticulous set-up of the crime and his supernatural atmospheres.<br /><br />(Carr didn't actually resort to the supernatural to resolve his mysteries, but his brooding, neo-gothic ambience might lead the reader to expect something ghostly in the works.)<br /><br />I had always thought that Carr would make a very fine ghost story author if he put his hand to it, and lo-and-behold this volume also includes three of his stories of the supernatural.<br /><br />To tell you the truth, I was a little disappointed in them (\\"The Man Who Was Dead,\\" \\"The Door to Doom,\\" and \\"Terror's Dark Tower\\") because Carr insisted on explaining everything, even if the explanation did involve a dollop of the ghostly.  He couldn't quite make the transition from mystery to true horror, but these three stories are still good for a shudder or two, especially \\"The Man Who Was Dead.\\"  If you read it, you may never want to ride the Underground again.<br /><br />Those of you who are old enough to have listened to episodes of that grand old radio show, \\"Suspense\\" might be interested to learn that this author also wrote for this and other radio programs.  Six of his radio plays are included in \\"The Door to Doom,\\" including the classic \\"Cabin B-13\\" which was later made into the movie, \\"Dangerous Crossing\\" starring Michael Rennie and Jeanne Crain.  CBS also broadcast about twenty Carr plays under the title \\"Cabin B-13\\" in 1948.  \\"In each of the episodes the ship's doctor tells of bizarre crimes, often in exotic settings...\\"<br /><br />Finally, do not neglect the two Sherlock Holmes parodies and the two essays that appear at the end of this very fine collection.  Carr's thoughts on 'the grandest game in the world' (mystery writing) should be exceptionally interesting to all lovers of this genre, and he also includes his choices for the Top Ten mystery novels of all time.t be interested to learn that this author also wrote for this and other radio programs.

None of the characters cross over.  However, they're both a pleasure to read, so have no qualms about buying this edition.<br /><br />Some of Tanya Huff's stock characters inhabit \\"Gate of Darkness Circle of Light\\": the crabby, driven heroine; the manly-yet-innocent hunk (in this case, an Angel); a surly cat that deals very efficiently with the Dark (much more so than the humans or the Angel); and a musician who struggles with his sexual identity through most of the book.<br /><br />That said, there are also some very unique characters in this urban fantasy about a band of intrepid heroines and heroes who attempt to save Toronto (and the rest of the world) from the forces of Darkness on Midsummer's Eve. One of them is a Bag Lady who is genuinely smelly and not at all cute. Another is a brain-damaged muffin maker.<br /><br />The musician is singled out by Huff to endure a particularly gristly coming-of-age journey. He is captured by ogres, and when he manages to escape from them, he has to run a gauntlet of ever more hideous fairy-tale creatures before he makes it back to Toronto to help save the Earth.<br /><br />\\"Gate of Darkness Circle of Light\\" is a pleasure to read, well-plotted, with an interesting twist at the end. The most unlikely people band together in an attempt to defeat Evil, and Huff brings them all together in a way that satisfies and makes sense.<br /><br />Tanya Huff sets \\"The Fire's Stone\\" in a fairly standard fantasy world (thief, wizard, prince go on quest), but her characters are completely her own.  For one thing there's an unusual love triangle---at least it would be unusual in most fantasies---but common for Huff.  Really, the only non-Huffian part of the triangle is a virgin who intends to stay that way.<br /><br />Although there is a bit too much text wasted on the love story, \\"The Fire's Stone\\" is a strong, well-plotted fantasy with likeable, interesting characters (or unlikeable, interesting characters, including a pair of really evil twins).  Huff does her usual good job with the minor characters, especially the soldiers and Travelers (gypsies).  I even liked the evil wizard.  He could have talked me right into joining him.<br /><br />The fantastical clutter of magic stones, mirrors, and wizards are handled in such an imaginative way that they held my interest to the end, especially during the scenes in the wizard's dwelling and the cauldron of the volcano.<br /><br />After a sparkling introduction wherein the thief, Aaron attempts to steal the emerald from the Ischian king's scepter as a funerary gift for his friend, we meet the three main characters:  Aaron, plus Prince Darvish who captures him in the act of thieving, plus Chandra, a Wizard of the Nine who is the prince's reluctant fianc&eacute;e.<br /><br />When an unknown wizard steals the Fire's Stone, which is the only magical device that stands between Ischia and a burning death by lava, Aaron, Darvish, and Chandra set out on a quest to recover The Stone.<br /><br />Each of the three have character flaws that must be overcome before they can work together to confront the evil wizard and return The Stone to Ischia.  Huff handles this part of the story very well, and I was really rooting for Aaron, Darvish, and Chandra, although  admittedly, I was hoping Chandra and Darvish would fall in love with each other, and finish off the story with a standard romance.<br /><br />Alas, Huff was too clever for me there.

The author of \\"Gorgon\\" began his career with field work on the proof of the quick and terrible extinction at the K-T boundary--the death knell of the dinosaurs.<br /><br />However, Dr. Ward found himself more and more intrigued by an even great extinction event that occurred 250 million years ago at the boundary of the Permian and the Triassic (P/T).  Was it caused by another comet or meteor strike?  Did the elimination of 95 % of Earth's marine life and 70% of all land species proceed as quickly as at the K-T termination, or did it take place in pulses over a much longer period of time?<br /><br />According to the author (and others), there is no credible, unambiguous evidence for an impact as is the case for the K-T extinction.  What is more likely is that massive greenhouse gas emissions reduced oxygen availability, ultimately resulting in the collapse of marine ecosystems, and most of the land-based systems as well.  This was possibly caused by volcanic eruptions on the supercontinent of Pangea, in what is now Siberia (the Siberian Traps).<br /><br />In the final chapter of his book, \\"Resolution,\\" the author puts forth two interesting observation-based theories:  (1) the abundance of oxidized, reddish rock in the Triassic beds above the P/T boundary (about 50 million years worth) implies \\"...the oxygen in our atmosphere plunged to very low levels as it became tied up in the rocks...so low, in fact, that any poor human...would very quickly suffer from altitude sickness, even at sea level.\\"; (2) on land at least, the near extinction of animals that didn't use oxygen efficiently, including most but not all of the mammal-like reptiles that dominated the Permian.  \\"Heat [greenhouse effect] and asphyxiation [were] the two agents of the long mysterious mass extinction.\\"<br /><br />Except for the last chapter, \\"Gorgon\\" is light on theory and heavy on field work and proof-of-concept.

According to the author, Nino Lo Bello, no baby has ever been born in the Vatican. (The timing would have to be just right, but here's some mother-to-be's chance to get into the Guinness Book of World Records.)<br /><br />Actually, I was rather surprised that no infants at all had been born in the Vatican since some of the popes were not exactly celibate.  This author mentions a few who had mistresses and children.  He does not skip over the immoral bits, but this book is sweetly gossipy rather than malicious.  The anecdote that I found most startling concerned the late Pope John Paul II:  one of the first things he did upon ascending to the Throne of St. Peter was watch back-to-back showings of \\"The Exorcist.\\"<br /><br />Here is a sample of the type of questions you will find answered in this book:<br /><br />* What size shoe did Jesus wear?<br /><br />* Over what did the Vatican go to 'war' with another ministate [San Marino in 1978]?<br /><br />* Which European queen is buried in the Vatican?<br /><br />* Why didn't Sam Snead get his putter blessed by the Pope?<br /><br />* Which U.S. comedian was arrested at the Vatican?<br /><br />Do not neglect to read this book's appendixes, as these are where you will find some of the best anecdotes.  The author relaxes out of the question-and-answer format of the previous 162 pages and tells some very interesting stories.  One of my favorites is \\"John Paul II Gives Galileo a Second Chance.\\"  There is also a fascinating appendix on \\"The Making of a Saint,\\" although this author contradicts John Cornwell (author of \\"Hitler's Pope\\") in some of the particulars, most especially concerning the continuing existence of a \\"Devil's Advocate.\\"<br /><br />Oh, and one of the facts that I thought I knew about the Vatican was firmly contradicted by this author:  Michelangelo did NOT design the uniform for the Swiss Guards, as is stated in all the guide books.  A Vatican seamstress whipped up the colorful costume in 1914 at the request of the Pope.e Swiss Guards, as is stated in all the guide books.

John Dickson Carr began his professional writing career, at the age of twenty-five, with his Inspector Bencolin mystery novels. However, M. Bencolin first appeared in some of Carr's earlier college stories published in the school newspaper, \\"The Haverfordian.\\"  (It may surprise you to learn that John Dickson Carr was American).  \\"The Door to Doom\\" includes four of those short stories, which began to appear in 1926.  Bencolin is not quite the suave, Mephistophelian character that he becomes in his full-length novels, but his fans will still want to read these stories for Carr's meticulous set-up of the crime and his supernatural atmospheres.<br /><br />(Carr didn't actually resort to the supernatural to resolve his mysteries, but his brooding, neo-gothic ambience might lead the reader to expect something ghostly in the works.)<br /><br />I had always thought that Carr would make a very fine ghost story author if he put his hand to it, and lo-and-behold this volume also includes three of his stories of the supernatural.<br /><br />To tell you the truth, I was a little disappointed in them (\\"The Man Who Was Dead,\\" \\"The Door to Doom,\\" and \\"Terror's Dark Tower\\") because Carr insisted on explaining everything, even if the explanation did involve a dollop of the ghostly.  He couldn't quite make the transition from mystery to true horror, but these three stories are still good for a shudder or two, especially \\"The Man Who Was Dead.\\"  If you read it, you may never want to ride the Underground again.<br /><br />Those of you who are old enough to have listened to episodes of that grand old radio show, \\"Suspense\\" might be interested to learn that this author also wrote for this and other radio programs.  Six of his radio plays are included in \\"The Door to Doom,\\" including the classic \\"Cabin B-13\\" which was later made into the movie, \\"Dangerous Crossing\\" starring Michael Rennie and Jeanne Crain.  CBS also broadcast about twenty Carr plays under the title \\"Cabin B-13\\" in 1948.  \\"In each of the episodes the ship's doctor tells of bizarre crimes, often in exotic settings...\\"<br /><br />Finally, do not neglect the two Sherlock Holmes parodies and the two essays that appear at the end of this very fine collection.

Linda was an animal lover, and they now had lots of property and a barn.<br /><br />Binky, the Dutch rabbit with no social skills was first.  \\"Wouldn't it be fun to have a little animal hopping around the house,\\" asked Linda, and after a long and futile (and funny) argument from the not-so-animal-loving Bob, in hopped their first tenant--and not into the drafty barn.<br /><br />I used to think rabbits would be a cinch to own, until a friend of mine ended up with two from the local animal shelter.

Let's get on with the plot.\\"  All I got out of the lecture were the many ways ice and frozen blood could be used to kill someone who is supposedly alone in a sealed room.<br /><br />Plus if you ask me, the murders in this book were cheats done with smoke (actually snow) and mirrors, and a clock that only the lumbering Dr. Fell had the brains to notice was incorrectly set.  However, I don't read this author for his intricate murder set-ups.  I read his books for their wonderfully ominous atmosphere.  Here Carr does not disappoint.  In \\"The Hollow Man,\\" three brothers, jailed in Transylvania for bank robbery fake their deaths during an outbreak of the plague and are buried alive.

But in \\"Dead by Sunset\\" the author fooled me.  The last section of the book concerns the murderer's trial which Rule actually attended, and it's got the spit and sparkle of real life.  The dialogue between the defendant, who was acting as his own lawyer (he had not gone to law school or passed the bar) and the rather acerbic judge, is priceless.  The old saw about 'the lawyer who tries his own case has a fool for a defendant' is proven to be doubly true in the case of Brad Cunningham, who tended to ramble tediously on about the state of his finances even though he was on trial for murder.  When Cunningham decided to take to the witness stand and cross-examine himself, he made himself fair game for the prosecution and a legal dilemma for the judge.  Here is a sample of the defendant versus judge dialogue, after Judge Alexander repeatedly warns Cunningham about asking improper questions:<br /><br />\\"'I'm walking just on the edge,' Brad countered defiantly.<br /><br />\\"'And you're stumbling over...'<br /><br />\\"Brad had always argued with anyone who did not agree with him.  Stubbornly he was arguing now with Judge Alexander.<br /><br />\\"'This is why we go to law school, Mr. Cunningham,' the judge said.  'It's a sophisticated concept.'\\"<br /><br />The first 464 pages of this book are standard Ann Rule.  A beautiful, brilliant attorney marries a psychopath and suffers dreadfully for her choice of mate.  She bears him three beautiful, brilliant little boys while Brad runs through her money, accumulates girlfriends, and is never home when she and the boys need him (I definitely thought that was a plus, considering what he did when he was home).  Finally, Cheryl can't bear his abuse any longer.  She files for a divorce, and starts collecting evidence about his financial misdealing.  She also wants full custody of the boys.<br /><br />Oops.  Cheryl is beaten to death in the first ten pages.<br /><br />The next 454 pages don't dwell on the mystery of who killed her.  Everyone knows who did her in, but there is very little physical evidence.  Instead, the author dissects Brad's various marriages and affairs, with emphasis on his brutality toward Cheryl and his children.  We learn everyone's life story.  We are told over and over again how slender, frail, and beautiful Cheryl was, what a good mother she was, and how her brilliance as an attorney was beginning to be recognized by one and all.  In the midst of all these repetitive eulogies, I couldn't help remembering poor Eliza's deathbed scene in \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\\"  Ann Rule spends so much time cranking Cheryl up to heaven, that I was almost glad when she died.

This book is one of the late, great Andre Norton's mixed barbeques:  it starts out as straight science fiction then gradually descends into magic.  The likeable Prince Andas wakes up in a tower on an alien planet after a ferocious storm has knocked out the power to his prison.  Other prisoners gather, all of them important people on their own worlds, including a woman with green hair, gills and pearly scales, a cynical Salariki  (Norton's favorite cat-like aliens first appear  in \\"Plague Ship\\"), and a man who seems to know more about the installation than any of his fellow captives.<br /><br />The robots that had been guarding and caring for the prisoners have all been disabled by the storm, and as the six captives learn about each other, they begin to realize that some of them have been held in 'stass' for decades.  The worlds that they were kidnapped from may no longer care about their existence.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Prince Andas wants to go back to his world to see who is ruling in his place, and regain power if he can.  After many adventures, he returns to Inyanga and skulks through the hidden ways of his palace, with his companion the Salariki, Lord Yolyos, trying to find the android who replaced him on his throne.<br /><br />Andas does indeed confront his double, a much older version of himself who has sired children, and begins to wonder who is the android and who is the real prince?  How does an android age?  How does it beget offspring?<br /><br />Now comes a touch of magic and also confusion.  Andas, after all of his adventures in what is his 'here and now' is lured into a parallel universe where the local version of Prince Andas is dying.  A nasty blend of magic and technology has driven the dying prince into exile, and he wants his counterpart to take his place, and straighten things out.<br /><br />So the kidnapped prince is in a sense kidnapped once more, and sets out in the true Andre Norton underdog style to win back his (alternate universe) throne.<br /><br />\\"Android at Arms\\" (1971) is a bit haphazard plotwise, but it is still full of interesting and likeable characters who forge their own destinies against all odds.erse) throne.   <br /> <br />\\"Android at Arms\\" (1971) is a bit haphazard plotwise, but it is still full of interesting and likeable characters who forge their own destinies against all odds. <br />	2005-06-05

I never thought I'd be rooting for Huey Long to become governor of Louisiana but compared to the power structure he was replacing, he was a knight in shining armor.<br /><br />The river that weaves through the story is of course, the Mississippi, and the author begins in the mid-1800s up through the great flood of 1927, and a few years beyond.  He has some astounding history to tell us:<br /><br />* The 1920s version of the Ku Klux Klan failed, not because it didn't have grassroots support, but because it had never been visualized as an organization like, say, the Kiwanis.  It was basically set up as a pyramid scheme to sell memberships with weird titles like 'kleagle,' 'wizard,' 'exalted cyclop,' and 'hydra of the realm.'  Klansmen ended up as elected officials in several states, but squabbled over the membership fees, defrauded members of their contributions, and sank quickly out of sight, although not quick enough for some.<br /><br />* One of the chief Mississippi Delta plantation owners, LeRoy Percy, kicked the Klan out of his county, calling them 'spies, liars, [and] cowards.'  Later, he blocked the transportation of black flood refugees from his county, afraid that once they left they'd never return.  So his sharecroppers spent a miserable few months on the levee with inadequate food, shelter, and medical attention, forced into work gangs to repair the levees.<br /><br />* The engineers who originally surveyed the Mississippi River in order to recommend flood-control measures were flatly opposed to a levees-only policy.  Yet through cronyism, bad compromises, and ignorance, levees-only became the official standard.  This author proves that it was absolutely doomed to failure.<br /><br />* New Orleans was never in any real danger from the flood of 1927.  Too many levees had given way upstream for the flood waters to threaten the great port city.  Nevertheless, the bankers and businessmen decided prop up the confidence of their investors by dynamiting the levees downriver from their city and turning 10,000 of their neighbors into refugees.  The refugees with very few exceptions were never reimbursed for their lost property and mangled lives.<br /><br />There is one heroic man in this book:  the engineer James Buchanan Eads who understood the Mississippi River better than any living man.  He had spent the first part of his career salvaging wrecks from the bottom of the river, and was bitterly opposed to the policies of the Army Corps of Engineers.  Eads was ultimately proved correct in almost every policy he advocated, almost every engineering project he drove forward on the river, including the jetties that deepened the South Pass of the river, and allowed ocean vessels to dock at the Port of New Orleans.<br /><br />If only all of the capitalists and engineers in this book had been like Eads, the Great Flood of 1927 which forced nearly a million people from their homes, might never have come to pass.<br /><br />This book is an absorbing, original look at an era in the Deep South that most of us would rather pass quickly by.  The great natural disaster that Barry so vividly describes was a turning point in our nation: a death blow to share-cropping practices in the Delta bottomlands; and the robber-baron elite of New Orleans (Huey Long saw to the latter).oo many levees had given way upstream for the flood waters to threaten the great port city.

Mairelon the Magician, who turns out to be a toff, and his ward Kim, the former street thief. Genre-wise, it is a regency romance with an overlay of fantasy.  Those who prefer their fantasy straight up might be bored with all of the romance bits:  Aunt Agatha's attempts to introduce her 'niece' to Polite Society and find her a husband; all of the long, dull trips to the modiste; the requisite carriage ride through Hyde Park; the coming-out ball; the visit to the opera and various upper-crust house parties.  Blah blah.  Regency romance aficionados could write these parts in their sleep.<br /><br />The less structured part of the novel involves magic.  A burglar dressed like a gentleman attempts to steal a book from the Mairelon's library. Kim visits one of her former friends, a used clothes merchant, and learns that a moneylender of their acquaintance is scarpering up all of London's street magicians for his own nefarious purposes. Somehow, the moneylender coordinates an attack on one of the street witches, then Mairelon, himself.  Both are stripped of their magic, and one eventually goes crazy.<br /><br />Kim must somehow rescue her guardian and restore his magic while attending to the details of her coming-out ball, and all of the other fripperies and fribbles that Regency society demands of her.<br /><br />This book is an improvement over its predecessor, \\"Mairelon the Magician\\" (1991), but Hutch is still chewing on his damn mustache, and most of the characters, with the exception of Kim and Mairelon are 'borrowed' whole-cloth from a million other regencies	2005-05-27

Yet in \\"Swan Song,\\" he gave us the bald, pub parrot that recited Heine in the original German.<br /><br />In \\"Love Lies Bleeding,\\" Mr. Merrythought, the ancient, slovenly bloodhound thwarted a double murder.<br /><br />\\"The Long Divorce\\" introduces Lavender, the cat who sees Martians.  (Either you have a cat who sees Martians---there is one perched on my printer right now, staring off into what humans refer to as `empty space'---or else you will have to take Mr. Crispin's word that such perceptive cats exist.)  Lavender, the marmalade-colored tomcat with unusual visual powers is instrumental in the capture of a murderer.<br /><br />Murder is really secondary to the story of a village plagued by an anonymous letter-writer.  Some of the letters are merely obscene.  Others are poisonously factual.<br /><br />Gervase Fen, Professor of English Language and Literature in the University of Oxford is importuned by an old friend to expose the anonymous letter-writer.  And so Fen, microscopically disguised under the name of `Mr. Datchery' (borrowed from Charles Dickens's \\"The Mystery of Edmund Drood\\") takes himself off to his friend's bucolic village.<br /><br />\\"To an obbligato of bird-song Mr Datchery marched beneath a bright sky towards Cotton Abbas.  And he carolled lustily, to the distress of all animate nature, as he walked....The directions given him at Twelford had been explicit.  But since he believed himself to possess an infallible bump of locality, he was soon tempted to modify them with a variety of short cuts, and after about three miles he discovered, much to his indignation, that he was lost.\\"<br /><br />Is that or is that not Fen to the life?<br /><br />\\"The Long Divorce\\" (1952) is eighth in Crispin's series of mysteries starring his literate, cynical, sometimes bumptious amateur detective.  It is also a comedy of rural, post-war England.  The characters are dead-on: the army veteran who is trying to stop smoking; the female physician who is struggling to build a practice in a conservative backwater;  the teenager who both loves and is ashamed of her obnoxious, money-grubbing father.<br /><br />Many of the mystery writers of the 1940s and 1950s were guilty of creating one-dimensional female stereotypes, or going off on the occasional anti-feminist rant.  Margery Allingham, Rex Stout, and John Dickson Carr come readily to mind as producing examples of this type of writing.  Crispin also creates the occasional stereotype, especially in his early novels and some of his short stories, but the characters in \\"The Long Divorce\\" are fully and fascinatingly realized---especially the women (okay, okay---except for the innkeeper's wife and the sluttish barmaid.

Crispin also creates the occasional stereotype, especially in his early novels and some of his short stories, but the characters in \\"The Long Divorce\\" are fully and fascinatingly realized---especially the women (okay, okay---except for the innkeeper's wife and the sluttish barmaid.

He spits a lot as he circles the corpse, rolls his own cigarettes and mashes them out beneath his boot heel.  A forensic specialist would find traces of him all over the scene.  In \\"Notches,\\" he even hides evidence because he wants to track a killer without interference from the FBI.<br /><br />On the plus side, nothing at the scene escapes him.  If he is called in to examine one body, he may find two others near by that no one else has noticed--which is exactly what occurs in \\"Notches.\\"  Someone has been killing girls and dumping them \\"like old guts in the brush for the coyotes to eat,\\" according to Du Pr&eacute;'s long-time mistress, Madelaine.<br /><br />There are two serial killers on the loose in \\"Notches\\" which makes for a confusing plot.  There are also two FBI agents who add to the scenery, but don't do much more than engage in slanging matches with Du Pr&eacute;.  Madelaine finally presses Du Pr&eacute; into tracking the killers down when her own daughter runs away from home.<br /><br />Du Pr&eacute; is laconic to the point of partial sentences, but the interrupted staccato of his speech is a perfect counterpoint to the harsh Montana landscape and to the sometimes abbreviated lives of its inhabitants.  Over 150 corpses form an even grimmer than usual backdrop to Du Pr&eacute;'s musings on the long history of his people and the land.<br /><br />\\"Notches\\" is not so much a murder mystery as it is a complex landscape of hell from the pen of a Montanan Hieronymus Bosch.	2005-05-25
229474:US	53084107	R3KGHNVYR0QEF6	B00070N22Q	333277157	The Michael Innes treasury	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Three of Michael Innes's best mystery novels	John Innes Mackintosh Stewart (pseudonym Michael Innes) was born in 1906 in Edinburgh, Scotland.  He was educated at Oriel College, Oxford, and his mysteries reflect both his scholarship (the title of this book is from a poem by Thomas Hardy), and the year he spent in Vienna, studying Freudian psychoanalysis.<br /><br />The three novels included in this treasury are \\"The Case of the Journeying Boy,\\" \\"Hamlet, Revenge!,\\" and \\"Appleby's End.\\"<br /><br />The setting of 'Journeying Boy' (1949) is a product of the two years Innes spent at Queen's University in Belfast. I believe it is the only one of his mysteries to take place in Ireland.  It is also notable in that it does not feature his most famous detective, Sir John Appleby, but rather Appleby's successor at New Scotland Yard, Detective-Inspector Thomas Cadover. The new Inspector is a bit of a dry stick compared to the irrepressible Appleby---he refers to his predecessor as `the wayward Appleby'---but Cadover detects with the best of his literary kin (Appleby, Lord Peter, Professor Fen, etc.) All of the characters are introspective (remember that year in Vienna) and finely drawn.  No caricatures are to be found in `Journeying Boy'---not even the nuclear physicist.<br /><br />Not even the Irish.<br /><br />The narrative duties are divided between three main characters:  Inspector Cadover; Humphrey Paxton, the adolescent son of a famous nuclear physicist; and Richard Thewless, the middle-aged and somewhat unimaginative tutor who is hired to take Humphrey on a vacation to Ireland.  As always with Innes, the mystery is a mixture of high drama and low farce.  `Journeying Boy' doesn't quite venture into the surreal depths of some of the Appleby novels.  However, Innes displays his talent for hallucinatory description in several places.<br /><br />Even though `Journeying Boy' mentions Appleby only in passing, it is one of Innes's best, most intricate mysteries.  This author can switch from farce to horror better and faster than any of his contemporaries.  You'll be laughing while your hair is still standing straight up on the back of your neck.  If you don't believe me, read the chapter that takes place in a labyrinth of sea caves, where the boy Humphrey attempts to escape from his enemies.<br /><br />The second novel,\\"Hamlet, Revenge!,\\" first published in 1937 might be difficult to follow for readers who are not already familiar with Shakespeare's \\"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince Denmark.\\"<br /><br />However, it is well worth reading, not only for the richly allusive mystery, but also for the characters who create and act out its tragedy.  The author engraves his brittle, upper-class English in diamond-point prose.  He etches their wit with acid.  They are never dull.  To misquote the Bard himself, \\"Age cannot wither Innes's characters, nor murder stale their witty dialogue.\\"<br /><br />For the length of the tragedy at least, the reader will inhabit the manor and precincts of Scamnum Court, principal seat of the Duke of Horton---\\"It is a big place: two counties away it has a sort of little brother in Blenheim Palace.\\"<br /><br />Everything in \\"Hamlet, Revenge!\\" is done on a grand scale.  The Duchess of Horton persuades her old friend, the Lord Chancellor of England to act the part of Polonius in her amateur production of \\"Hamlet.\\"  Her husband is cast as Claudius, King of Denmark and she herself plays his Queen.  Their daughter, Elizabeth is Ophelia.  The greatest Shakespearean actor of the day plays the Melancholy Dane.<br /><br />All of the play's characters are put on edge by a series of mysterious messages, culminating in a quotation from \\"Macbeth\\", \\"...there shall be done a deed of dreadful note...\\"  Then the Lord Chancellor is shot to death at the very instant in the play when his character is supposed to die by Hamlet's sword.<br /><br />The young C.I.D. Inspector, John Appleby is called in to solve a murder that \\"was planned, deliberately and at obvious risk, to take place bang in the middle of a private performance of Hamlet.\\"<br /><br />He is also charged with recovering vital State documents that the second-most important figure in British government had with him when he motored down to Scamnum Court to strut and fret upon the ducal stage.  Until the very end of \\"Hamlet, Revenge!\\" the reader can never be sure if he or she is reading a murder mystery or a spy story.<br /><br />Detective Inspector John Appleby loses his heart to Judith Raven in \\"Appleby's End\\" (1945) after floating down an icy river on top of a carriage with her, then spending part of the night burrowed together in a haystack.  She beguiles him with gothic tales that were written by her Victorian great-uncle, Ranulph--tales that are now seemingly coming true.  Marble cows and pigs are being substituted for unsuspecting livestock.  Her brother Luke received a personalized tombstone in the mail, with his date of death carved on it.  Spot, the horse is found hitched up to the carriage, facing backward.  These all seem like minor pranks.  Then Judith and John stumble across a dead body buried neck-deep in the snow on their way home from the haystack.<br /><br />This is the first of the Appleby mysteries in which the reader is introduced to the Ur-folk.  It never fails to astonish me how much information a good author can pack into the monosyllabic expression, 'Ur.'  This conversational art reaches its zenith in \\"Night of Errors\\" (1948) which is inhabited by a butler by the name of Swindle, whose utterances consist mainly of the croaked \\"Urrr\\" sound and displeasing snuffles through his nose.<br /><br />I have to read the Innes novels at least twice before I really understand the plot and the subtleties of conversation, but his mysteries are certainly worth rereading.  If you are a fan of the British Golden Age of Mystery, I can almost guarantee that Michael Innes (J.I.M. Stewart) will insinuate himself somewhere near the top of your list of favorite authors.overing vital State documents that the second-most important figure in British government had with him when he motored down to Scamnum Court to strut and fret upon the ducal stage.

Most of the authors seem to borrow from Georgette Heyer and Joan Aiken, so we have Regency toffs, coves, sharps, and trulls as filtered through at least three generations of authors (I'm assuming Heyer and Aiken got most of their patois from authors who actually lived during England's Regency period).  It's hard on the ear and should be as dead as a Vaudeville sketch of some beleaguered minority.<br /><br />Americans are particularly bad at trying to fake English speech patterns two hundred years dead.  I wish they'd stop trying, especially the good ones like Patricia Wrede who can actually tell a story.<br /><br />So, other than that Mrs. Lincoln, how did you enjoy the play?<br /><br />\\"Mairelon the Magician\\" is an amusing comedy of manners--more dialogue than magic, and you have to memorize long lists of characters who keep showing up at the most inconvenient moments, such as in the midst of a burglary or an attempted elopement.  The two main characters, Mairelon the magician and the street waif, Kim are sharply drawn and likeable.  Everyone else is distinguished by a funny accent, or some sort of annoying habit such as chewing on the ends of their mustache.  I was minded to lean across the campfire and club Hutch with a piece of firewood the next time he put his mustache in his mouth.<br /><br />Other than that Mrs. Lincoln....<br /><br />Well, I did actually enjoy reading this confection and now I'm reading the sequel.  What can I say?  It's cute and there is a modicum of plot, plus a happy ending.  I love happy endings, but I do hope that Hutch shaves off his mustache for the sequel.	2005-05-21

It is philosophical, mystical at times, and is an in-depth look at the psychology of horses and humans together.<br /><br />Jane Smiley has a very ingratiating style, even though she gets a bit weird at times.  She has on tap a different sort of horse whisperer--this one telephones telepathic messages from horse to owner.  For instance, according to the telepath, the beautiful gray Thoroughbred, Hornblower didn't like his name so Smiley changed it informally, i.e. not through the Jockey Club, to Wowie.  She had everyone at the track call him 'Wowie' and he perked up and earned his keep, although not exactly setting the racecourse on fire.  Smiley also learned that Wowie liked the turf better than the main course, and preferred horse shoes with pads.  I realize the trainer probably had a lot to do with the last two items, but they also came over the telephone from Wowie's mind reader.<br /><br />At first, I felt embarrassed about reading a book where people communicate telepathically with horses and give them energy massages without actually touching them.  Then I realized that all people who raise, train, or race Thoroughbreds are a bit eccentric by non-horse-lover standards.<br /><br />I decided I would rather fit in with the horse-crazy folk any day, even if they do wear their underwear inside-out for luck.  Besides, Jane Smiley proves once and for all that horses are smarter than pigs, and they may be smarter than dogs.<br /><br />Some of the books that influenced Smiley while she was writing \\"A Year at the Races,\\" were \\"A General Theory of Love\\" by Dr. Thomas Lewis, et. al., Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\\" and Stephen Budiansky's \\"The Covenant of the Wild:  Why Animals Chose Domestication.\\"  She quotes freely from her sources while developing her own unique philosophy of why horses tolerate, and even like humans.<br /><br />This is not just a book about a year at the races.  It also includes the author's insights and adventures while jumping, riding, grooming, and just hanging around with horses.  Smiley writes calmly and flatly as though she were reassuring a jittery mount. I think that if you tend to be nervous around horses, you'll be able to form better equine relationships after reading this book.ntures while jumping, riding, grooming, and just hanging around with horses.

236479:US	53084107	R1575CWVYVGWGT	1581500408	464125573	Man o' War (Thoroughbred Legends)	Books	3	8	9	N	N	Volume 1 of the Eclipse Press's Thoroughbred Legends	Edward L. Bowen is an Eclipse Award-winning Turf writer, formerly editor-in-chief of \\"The Blood-Horse\\" magazine, and currently president of the Grayson-Jockey Club Research Foundation.  I believe his most recently published book is \\"Nashua,\\" which is volume eight of the `Thoroughbred Legends' series.<br /><br />In \\"Man o'War\\", Bowen ambles gently through the races, sales histories, and breeding record of 20th century America's greatest Thoroughbred.  There are also black-and-white photographs and a chart of all of Big Red's races, where he was first twenty out of twenty-one times.<br /><br />Of course, the race that Man o'War lost gets the most print.  As Bowen puts it, \\"Few events in sports have been recalled as often as the 1919 Sanford Memorial.\\" Consensus finally blamed the loss on the jockey, John Loftus although a fictional account I read of Man o'War's life had the two-year-old chestnut stumbling to his knees at the start of the Sanford.  Bowen has tracked down another theory in the newspapers of the day:  Man o'War was sideways at the start and when the barrier was sprung, he had to play catch-up for the rest of the six furlong race.<br /><br />Upset beat Big Red.  We Man o'War fans have to accept that.  However, the big chestnut stallion by Fair Play out of Mahubah was still voted the best American race horse of the century by the \\"Blood-Horse\\" magazine, and again in another poll conducted by the Associated Press.<br /><br />I don't think Upset left much of a record behind at stud, although the breeding shed was another arena where Man o'War excelled.  Bowen spends some print defending Samuel Riddle's rather eccentric breeding theories.  By today's standards Man o'War was not bred very often or to the cream of the mare crop, but his few progeny did exceedingly well.  His son War Admiral \\"was a major link in guaranteeing the ongoing influence of Big Red insofar as successful producing daughters.\\"  His son War Relic sired only fourteen stakes winners, but several of his progeny kept the Man o'War sire line alive into the 21st century, mainly through In Reality, and later through the 1990 Kentucky Derby winner, Unbridled.<br /><br />Bowen is an unhurried, knowledgeable writer and although this book isn't as exciting as some that come later in the series, his retelling of the legend of \\"The Mostest Hoss\\" is still worth reading., but several of his progeny kept the Man o'War sire line alive into the 21st century, mainly through In Reality, and later through the 1990 Kentucky Derby winner, Unbridled.  <br /> <br />Bowen is an unhurried, knowledgeable writer and although this book isn't as exciting as some that come later in the series, his retelling of the legend of \\"The Mostest Hoss\\" is still worth reading. <br />	2005-05-18

She says, \\"As an author who never knew him, I found myself delaying the time when I had to write the end of Scott Scurlock's story...I didn't want him to die.\\"<br /><br />She certainly succeeded in her delaying tactics, but whether her readers will want to follow her to the end on Thanksgiving Day, 1996---speaking for myself, I can't believe I read the whole thing.<br /><br />Some of the delaying tactics Rule used:<br /><br />* Interviewed everyone who came into contact with Scott, and told their life stories, too.<br /><br />* Included the biographies of the policeman and FBI agent who were instrumental in putting a stop to Scott's string of bank robberies.<br /><br />* Interviewed the policemen's wives and colleagues, bank tellers, etc.<br /><br />* Repeated herself over and over again about how beautiful and strong Scott was, how proud he was of his body, and how he could have been a movie star if only he had applied himself.  There's a nude photo of Scott doing press-ups in a chair.  You can judge for yourself.<br /><br />Oh well, this book also includes three more cases from the author's early days as a true crime writer:  \\"The Peeping Tom;\\" \\"The Girl Who Fell in Love with Her Killer;\\" and \\"The Least Likely Suspect.\\"  They at least are worth reading.	2005-05-16

In fact, Pius XII commissioned a documentary (with himself in the starring role) called \\"Pastor Angelicus\\" right around the time that he began to receive reliable information about Hitler's 'Final Solution' in 1942.<br /><br />Was this pope a saint-in-the-making, or was he a narcissistic, authoritarian protector of papal privilege who believed \\"that there could only be one faith:  the faith that is in communion with Rome\\"?<br /><br />Even though this book was published in 1999, it is still relevant, still controversial; because it seems very likely that Pope Pius XII (Eugenio Pacelli) is on the fast track to beatification, and ultimately, canonization.  According to the website \\"insidethevatican.com/newsflash-feb13-05\\" Pope John Paul II was quoted as saying, \\"I will not die before I canonize Pope Pius XII.\\"<br /><br />Of course, John Paul II did die before he could keep his promise (if indeed, the above quotation is accurate), but according to the last chapter in \\"Hitler's Pope,\\" the man within the Vatican who is chiefly responsible for investigating Pacelli's claim to sainthood is \\"combatively defensive of his subject, and has published an abrasive attack on Pacelli's critics in the pages of the international weekly 'The Tablet'.\\"<br /><br />John Cornwell draws upon previously secret Vatican archives to make the case that even well before the Holocaust, Cardinal Pacelli (later to become Pope Pius XII) was instrumental in negotiating a concordat with Hitler that helped sweep the Nazis into power.  In effect, the concordat neutralized the political clout of Germany's 23 million Catholics.<br /><br />Pacelli was not so much enamored of the Nazis as he was opposed to the atheistic Communists.  Not once during the war did he denounce the Nazis by name, or specifically condemn their slaughter of the Jews.  He also remained silent while the Catholic Croatians were exterminating their Serbian Orthodox Christian neighbors in 1941 and 1942.<br /><br />This silence is in stark contrast to his support of the Catholic Church's \\"unrelenting noncooperation in the face of Soviet Communism.\\"  When the Soviets invaded Hungary, Pacelli openly encouraged resistance unto death.  When he made the Hungarian primate, Mindszenty a cardinal, Pacelli told him, \\"Among the thirty-two [new cardinals] you will be the first to suffer the martyrdom whose symbol this red color [of the cardinal's hat] is.\\"<br /><br />Pope Pius XII was an intensely private man whose version of the doctrine of the Mystical Body \\"deepened his convictions about the papal ideology of power and confirmed his prejudice that non-Catholics were alien to the people of God.\\"<br /><br />Perhaps 'Pastor Angelicus' was the wrong Pope for the stark decades when Hitler rose to power and ultimately plunged the world into war and the Jews and other minorities into the 'Final Solution.'  Pacelli's aspirations to holiness, his serene silence in the face of evil struck this author as ungodly rather than godly.  And of course there are those who violently disagree with Cornwell's conclusions.<br /><br />Sister Margherita Marchione, also known as 'the fighting nun' is an expert on Pius XII, and states that \\"most historians and fair-minded people now regard \\"Hitler's Pope: The Secret History of Pius XII\\" as biased...\\"<br /><br />I suggest you read this fascinating book and decide for yourself.  I found the author's thesis very learned, powerful, and disturbing.<br /><br />P.S.  Be sure to read the commentary attached to this review, as new documents are emerging that show Pope Pius XII and the Vatican were responsible for saving the lives of many Jews that the Germans would otherwise have deported to labor and extermination camps.	2005-05-13

This certainly contravenes popular belief and my own (admittedly brief) observations of this fascinating water mammal.  Last spring, I watched two young otters romping along the riverbank below the house, in company with their mother.  One of the youngsters climbed the steep, 120-foot bank almost all the way to our house, then slid back down into the river.  He didn't appear to be looking for food.  I think he was just exploring.<br /><br />This author follows Davis's 1978 classification of otters into three different tribes, based on their vocalizations, the shape of the baculum (p*nis bone) and the appearance of the male external genitalia.  The three groups are the Lutrini, with a baculua shaped like a hockey stick, which includes the common Eurasian otter, the American river otter, and the South American sea cat or marine otter; the Aonychini, who have baculum shaped like baseball bats and include the African clawless otters, Asian smooth-coated otters, giant otters, and sea otters; and the Hydrictini which contains only one species, the spotted-necked otter which also has a bacula shaped like a baseball bat.<br /><br />Most of the observations in this book are concentrated on the Eurasian otter, the American river otter, and the sea otter, because these species are the most common, and the most commonly studied.<br /><br />The chapters are seven in number:  \\"Introduction;\\" \\"What is an otter?;\\" \\"Food and feeding behavior\\" (basically otters eat everything they can catch, usually fish and crustaceans, but also birds and skunks); \\"Relations with other animals;\\" \\"Social organization and communication;\\" \\"Life History;\\" and \\"Otters and man\\" (definitely the saddest chapter in this otherwise spritely book).<br /><br />Some of the most interesting text involves the eating habits of sea otters.  The sea otters in Monterey Bay, California have learned how to pry open discarded beer cans which are used as refuges by small octopuses.  I also learned that sea otters have underarm pouches where they can store the flat stones that they use to break open crustacean shells.<br /><br />Who among us has not seen a nature documentary that features a whiskery sea otter, lying on its back and pounding a shellfish open against the rock on its tummy?<br /><br />\\"The Natural History of Otters\\" includes 17 color plates and extensive line-drawings and diagrams, an impressive bibliography, and an index.<br /><br />If you've read \\"Ring of Bright Water\\" and would like to know more about these likeable mammals, Paul Chanin's natural history is a quick, enjoyable read, except for the grim final chapter.carded beer cans which are used as refuges by small octopuses.

Then my husband read it.  I could hear him sitting in the john and laughing hysterically far into the night (actually, it didn't take him that long to read it, because it's only 80 pages long, with many zany illustrations.)<br /><br />The first two \\"Tosca\\" anecdotes in this book are 'the' opera classics.  You only have to mention 'Tosca and the trampoline' or 'Tosca and the firing squad' to an opera buff to initiate a bout of uncontrollable laughter.  I truly believe Hugh Vickers's theory of the 'curse of Tosca.'  A friend of mine caught a performance of this opera in Rome in 2005, while the cardinals were busy electing a new pope.  All went well until the banquet scene, where Tosca is being blackmailed into sleeping with Scarpia, while her lover is tortured offstage.  Well, in this performance, Scarpia's pants fell down just as he was lunging for the toothsome soprano.  He had to sit down and motion for one of his thugs to bring him a safety pin.  All Rome trembled with laughter before this Scarpia.<br /><br />Although Vickers does not name the two sopranos who were immortalized by the trampoline and the suicidal firing squad, he does name places and performances so I'm assuming that his anecdotes are not entirely apocryphal.<br /><br />All of the great stories are here:  not one, but two Lohengrins who had to cope with vanishing swans; Rigoletto's sliding hump (I actually attended a performance where Rigoletto took off his coat and threw it on the Duke's throne--and the hump went with it.  The not-so-hunchbacked hunchback sang the rest of his aria, then showed up in the following scene at the inn with his hump reattached).<br /><br />One of my favorite stories concerning mechanical malfunctions involves an Edinburgh \\"Don Giovanni,\\" where the conductor placed the Commendatore and his accompanying trombonists in the Gents' lavatory to get the properly ghostly sound effects--Unfortunately, \\"the long-defunct automatic flush system suddenly came torrentially to life at the exact moment of 'Di rider finirai pria dell'aurora' --and since the performance was being broadcast, B.B.C.

The Roman author, Terence once said, \\" Homo sum; humani nil a me alienum puto\\" (I am human; I think nothing human foreign to me), but obviously he hadn't read \\"Rogues, Villains and Eccentrics.\\"<br /><br />This book is \\"Burke's Peerage\\" as interpreted by Monty Python's Flying Circus, with a few lower-class gangsters, rogues, and levitating butlers thrown in to an already incredible mix of human misbehavior.<br /><br />What we have is not good old-fashioned American humor as typified by a Dave Barry booger joke.  Rather the humor is meticuluously British, as typified by, \\"Lady Victoria has made her mark on the public imagination by appearing in nightclubs in her foundation garments.\\"<br /><br />Speaking of Yanks versus Brits, the American version of Charles Bronson is a bit of a poof compared to his British counterpart.<br /><br />The British Charles Bronson was imprisoned for stealing 35 pounds from a Liverpudlian jeweler, whereupon he \\"assaulted more than twenty prison officers, [took] two governors and seven Iraqi terrorists hostage, lassoed a visiting teacher with a skipping rope and caused 500,000 pounds worth of damage to prison property.\\"<br /><br />One of my favorite entries involves two female cross-dressing pirates.  They were so well disguised, that one tried to seduce the other, thinking she was a man.  Even after they sorted things out, Anne Bonny and Mary Read remained friends.  (If this episode doesn't bring to mind the song, \\"I'm a lumberjack and I'm okay...\\" then you are obviously not a Monty Python fan).<br /><br />Entries in this compendium are hilariously and sometimes mysteriously cross-referenced.  For instance, these items pertaining to butlers:<br /><br />* \\"butlers, disgraced bishops masquerading as.  See JOCELYN, THE REVERENT PERCY.\\"<br /><br />* \\"butlers, indecently assaulted.  See AUDLEY, MERVYN CASTLEFORD, 2ND BARON; JACKSON, THE REVEREND WILLIAM.\\"<br /><br />* \\"butlers, levitating.  See GREATRAKES, VALENTINE.\\"<br /><br />There are also a few black-and-white photos illustrating various rogues, villains, and eccentrics.  One of my favorites is captioned:  \\"The Reverend Harold Davidson, whose mission as the rector of Stiffkey was the salvation of fallen women, seen here in compromising circumstances with a young 'model'.  Brought before a consistory court, Davidson claimed that he had walked into a trap, but he was not believed.

The land is savage and so are the stories.  Two Eskimo men commit suicide at the beginning of \\"White Sky, Black Ice\\" and no-one seems to question the coincidence except for 'Dudley Do-Right' Alaska State Trooper Nathan Active.<br /><br />Nathan Active, an Inupiat Eskimo himself, is actually called 'Dudley Do-Right' by yet another man who is about to commit suicide.  This comes much later in the book.  Initially Nathan is suspicious of the suicides because both men appeared to have shot themselves in their Adam's Apple.  Both of the dead men also had jobs at the Gray Wolf Copper Mine, run by a Norwegian conglomerate called GeoNord.<br /><br />Aha! You say.  Evil Big Business ruins pristine Alaskan wilderness and destroys anyone who gets in its way.<br /><br />Well, no, not quite.  \\"White Sky, Black Ice\\" is much more complex than that.  There are also many subplots, one involving a shaman's curse on an Inupiat family who had already lost two sons by suicide.  When the third son seemingly kills himself, everyone shrugs and says, \\"It was Billy Karl's curse.\\"  As Nathan Active puts it, \\"Despair blew through Chukchi's streets like the west wind.  He wondered if he could endure it long enough to get his transfer to Anchorage.\\"<br /><br />Active himself was given up for adoption by an unmarried Inupiat girl, and was raised by white parents in Anchorage.  He certainly had no plans to return to Chukchi where his birth mother lives.  Yet here he is, and all of the old Inupiat 'Aanas' plot to find a bride for the 'nalauqmiiyaaq' (almost white man) State Trooper, including his birth mother.<br /><br />Nathan slowly sifts through the clues offered up by alcoholic Inupiats, and little old 'Aanas' who blackmail him into giving them rides to the bingo game with his Explorer's flasher on.<br /><br />Author Stan Jones was born in Anchorage, and has worked as an award-winning journalist there for most of his career.  He is also a bush pilot, and readers will be imbibing lots of authentic detail about Alaskans, both native and white, and about the Alaskan wilderness, along with the bones of this well-plotted mystery.<br /><br />In fact, one of the characters is a rather likeable bush pilot, who we come across while trying to fix a tear in the fabric of his plane with a roll of duct tape.  Unfortunately, it's too damn cold for the duct tape to stick.  He takes Nathan up anyway.  It's the code of the bush pilots not to get too excited about a little tear in the tail flap.<br /><br />This mystery is definitely not a cozy.  It is edgy, boozy, and sad.

One of the most frightening aspects of this true-crime story is that theoretically, the serial killer, Jerry Brudos could be released back into the community.  He's been in the Oregon State Penitentiary for over twenty years now, manufacturing leather key fobs, collecting women's shoe catalogues, and keeping the prison's computer network humming.  If he does get his freedom, no one should be surprised if he starts collecting women's shoes again--with the feet still in them.<br /><br />I found \\"Lust Killer\\" to be one of Ann Rule's most disturbing books, not in the least because a young, door-to-door encyclopedia saleswoman was Jerry Brudos's first murder victim.  Usually I can distance myself from serial killer victims, telling myself that I would never allow myself to get in a situation like that, e.g. hitching a ride on the freeway.  However, I did sell encyclopedias door-to-door while I was working my way through college, and yes, our bosses insisted that we wear high heels.  If I'd been flogging my books in Oregon, my foot might have ended up in Brudos's freezer, too.<br /><br />Ann Rule, a former policewoman writes about the victims with a compassion that sometimes ventures over the border into clich&eacute;.  Many are described as stunningly beautiful, innocent, soft-spoken, harmless, well-loved, kindhearted creatures who would certainly have qualified for sainthood if their lives had not been cut tragically short.  One good lesson does come out of this book though:  the author emphasizes that the victims who fought got away.  The ones who yielded or tried to talk their way out of captivity, died a gruesome death.<br /><br />The author tells the story of Jerry Brudos, from several perspectives, including that of the unlucky encyclopedia saleswoman, Brudos's wife, and the homicide detectives who finally trapped and arrested him.  Mainly though, we see the serial killer through his own thoughts and actions.  I don't know how Ann Rule got into his head, but she does a very chilling job of portraying this man who preferred his sex partners dead, and who saved some very grisly souvenirs of his exploits.<br /><br />One of the most pitiable victims was Jerry Brodos's clueless wife.  She was actually arrested, charged, and tried for abetting in his murders (he brought his victims to his workshop in his garage, where he tortured, murdered, and dismembered them), mainly because her neighbors and the police couldn't believe that she didn't know what was going on.  Her husband certainly gave her lots of hints:  he never let her access the freezer in the garage--if she wanted something from it for dinner, he fetched it for her; he left nude photos and moulds of women's breasts lying around in the house; he occasionally paraded around in front of her wearing women's clothing.<br /><br />She was just one of those women who never challenged an authority figure, no matter how strangely he behaved.<br /><br />One factual error in the book:  Wisconsin killer Ed Gein did not murder his mother as stated by the author in this book.  On December 29th, 1945, Gein's mother died after a series of strokes, and Ed felt that he had \\"lost his only friend and one true love. And he was absolutely alone in the world.\\" (quoted from Harold Schechter in his book \\"Deviant\\").es a very chilling job of portraying this man who preferred his sex partners dead, and who saved some very grisly souvenirs of his exploits. <br /> <br />One of the most pitiable victims was Jerry Brodos's clueless wife.

She follows her intrepid geologists to the ends of the Earth like an eager cub reporter in some 1930s B-movie, peppering them with questions, almost getting trampled by an African elephant in the Namibian bush, beset by freezing fog in the Kalahari Desert, clambering down the windswept, godforsaken rocks of Mistaken Point in Newfoundland.<br /><br />This book is a combination travel guide to some of the least habitable places on earth, biographical sketches of the scientists who developed and tested the 'Snowball Earth' theory, and an introduction to the painstaking science behind the newest, most audacious 'deep time' history of our planet.<br /><br />Before we get to 'Snowball Earth,' let me give you a flavor of Walker's running travelogue.  Here she is speaking of Mistaken Point:  \\"Nobody could love these barren lands, not even their mother.  They are dreary and damp, their plants the color of overcooked spinach and rusty nails; when the wind is not buffeting them or rain beating them down, they are shrouded in fog.  The pale, thin caribou wander over them like lost souls.\\"<br /><br />Now, on to the theory as expounded by this book.  Several times in the history of Earth, most recently 700 million years ago, our planet froze completely over, possibly because all of the continents had migrated close to the Equator.  This deep-freeze may have ended the multi-billion-year reign of single-cell slime and given a kick-start to the Cambrian explosion of complex life.  Snowball Earth was finally melted by a build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, courtesy of volcanic eruptions which turned our planet into a hellish, hurricane-ripped green-house.  Eventually the excess carbon dioxide was absorbed back into the oceans and the planetary crust.  Multi-cellular life reveled in the first decent climate it had ever experienced, not realizing that meteor strikes and volcanic eruptions would occasionally wipe out up to 90% of its evolved species.<br /><br />Could we get a repeat of Snowball Earth?  Sure.  As a matter of fact, the continents seem to be sliding toward the Equator again, which will allow ice to build up at the Poles and advance toward Earth's bulging midline.  Will this happen during our lifetime?  Nah.  As Gabrielle Walker so vividly expresses it, the continental plates move at roughly the same speed our fingernails grow.<br /><br />The geologists, paleontologists, and their science form the core of this marvelously written book.  Walker does a meticulous job of relating both the scientific and the human side of the 'Snowball Earth' controversy.  Her incisive portraits of the scientific movers and shakers, most especially the fiercely competitive Paul Hoffman, will stick in your mind long after you forget about drop stones, tidal rhythmites, and magnetic reversals in the Flinders ice rocks.nto a hellish, hurricane-ripped green-house.

Readers of Stevermer's \\"A College of Magics\\" will recognize some of the place names, but this book takes off on its own with the very likeable Hail Rosmer and her fellow apprentices.<br /><br />Hail becomes obsessed with the deceased artist, Maspero who was interested in magic as well as art.  She discovers a gold medallion in the palace archives that Maspero supposedly cast, with a portrait of Good King Julian on one side, the obverse being a view of the city of Aravis.  She pesters the archivist into letting her sketch both sides of the medallion, then makes a wax copy, and casts it over and over again in bronze until she is satisfied with the result.<br /><br />The young apprentice is very pleased with her medallion until one of her jealous colleagues accuses her of counterfeiting.  What could any self-respecting heroine do but clobber her accuser over the head with her heavy market basket.  She then flees from the city, not knowing whether she killed her fellow apprentice.<br /><br />Four days into her flight along the river, it begins to rain and Hail takes shelter under a bridge.  There she sees a ragged tramp catch a mudskip with his bare hands and eat it raw.  This doesn't bother her half as much as the fact that the man is a dead ringer for good King Julian--who departed from life over 200 years ago.  She recognizes him from her medallion.<br /><br />Now we're into the sorcerous part of the book, with a magician as equally nasty as any that came out of \\"A College of Magics.\\"  Hail plays an important role in the battles and necromantic manipulations that follow, including the recasting of King Julian's crown (again, the original was fashioned by her favorite artist, Maspero).<br /><br />\\"When the King Comes Home\\" has a relatively happy ending if the reader is into artistic fulfillment rather than romance.  The wicked are punished, the good deceased sail away into a starlit diminuendo of love and death.

Her first novel, \\"The Prince Commands\\" was published in 1934, and this, her last, in 2005.  Her magically detailed world-building skills and upright, against-all-odds characters will be sorely missed.  Tor rushed a copy of this book into print, so that the 93-year-old author could see it before she died.

There are also two distant, but powerful parents and an exotic setting which happens not to be Witch World, but another troubled border land, whose inhabitants are constantly at war.  The setting might remind you of the Anglo-Scottish border before the accession of the Stuarts, except that the true battle is fought between the Light and the Dark, with an assist from the mundane world's princes and clan chieftains<br /><br />Clan Scorpys nurtures three daughters worthy of its proud name, who came into the warring borderland in a single birthing.  \\"Having no son to 'shield his back,' as the country saying goes\\" the triplets' father taught them horsemanship and the use of weapons.  Their mother tutored them in magic.  Tamara, Sabina, and Drucilla must use all the skills they can muster when they are kidnapped by a particularly obnoxious band of reivers in the pay of the Starkadder clan.  They are abused almost to the point of death, then left for dead in an underworld called the Dismals when the outlaws learn that the Scorpys clansmen are hot on their trail.<br /><br />The Dismals is a strange, psychedelic version of the upper world with huge spider-like creatures and things resembling praying mantises the size of a horse.  The triplets are rescued by an enigmatic man named Zolan who aids them, then attacks them psychically.  They repel and almost kill him, then in turn save his life.  They believe his attack was some sort of test.<br /><br />We long-time Norton fans know that Zolan can't be a true creature of the dark because his best friend is a cougar-sized cat named Climber.<br /><br />There are many more testings and near-death adventures in the dark caverns of the Dismals, then the triplets and Zolan regain the outer world, only to find that Evil has preceded them to the borderlands, and the King himself has been captured.<br /><br />This is another completely populated mythology, Dark versus Light, by the one of the most underrated fantasy writers of our time.

They believe his attack was some sort of test. <br /> <br />We long-time Norton fans know that Zolan can't be a true creature of the dark because his best friend is a cougar-sized cat named Climber. <br /> <br />There are many more testings and near-death adventures in the dark caverns of the Dismals, then the triplets and Zolan regain the outer world, only to find that Evil has preceded them to the borderlands, and the King himself has been captured. <br /> <br />This is another completely populated mythology, Dark versus Light, by the one of the most underrated fantasy writers of our time.

American Kelsie McBlair falls through an ancient stone gate in the Scottish Highlands while rescuing a wounded wild cat.  She and the cat (who promptly gives birth to two kittens) are besieged on the other side of the Gate by a Dark Rider and a pack of skeletal hounds, almost before Kelsie realizes she is no longer in Scotland.  (It will take the rest of the book to persuade her that there is no way back to her home world).<br /><br />When a dying Witch bequeaths her true name and her jewel of power to Kelsie, the American finds herself compelled to take up the woman's sorcerous mission into the heart of Escore, where magic lies in \\"trembling balance between the forces of Light and those of the Dark.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Gate of the Cat\\" is a stand-alone fantasy in Norton's fabulous Witch World series.  It takes place (roughly) after the conclusion of \\"Sorceress of the Witch World\\" and \\"Trey of Swords,\\" since characters from both of those novels also play roles (or are at least mentioned) in this book.  Yonan, a former border guard of Estcarp and the main narrator of \\"Trey of Swords,\\" is one of Kelsie's companions on her reluctant quest.  Their other companion is a rather nasty, man-hating witch who is known as Wittle. (Sometimes Norton attaches clunky names to her characters, but Wittle really is Wittle).<br /><br />The magic and the narrative pace are vintage Norton, and she takes us into one of the vilest places of the Dark to be found in any of the Escore fantasies.<br /><br />\\"The Gate of the Cat\\" is a must-read for Witch World fans.	2005-04-20

The author states that on the average, 300 mutations burden each newly conceived embryo.  Five of the mutations won't make it into the general population because of miscarriage and childhood deaths---\\"No one leaves the genetic casino unscathed.\\"  Being born with three sets of eye-lashes, an extra set of ears on one's neck, or in my case, crooked little fingers, are very benign mutations compared to what can and sometimes does go wrong.<br /><br />The primary theme of this elegant, engaging book is that mutations are the signposts that can be used to determine exactly where in the morphogenesis of an infant, something went physically or genetically astray.<br /><br />Chapter 1, \\"A Perfect Join (On the invisible geometry of embryos)\\" takes the reader on a tour through the first few hours and days of a fertilized egg.  Conjoined twins are an example of what can go wrong with the developmental mechanics within the womb.  One unfortunate baby was born with 21 partially developed twins (determined through a leg count) in his skull.  However, the main thrust of this chapter, using conjoined twins as an example of the process gone wrong, is the search for an 'organizer':  that which informs the cells what to do, what to become, and where to go.  It is a process that is part mechanical, part chemical, and part sheer dumb luck.  As the author puts it:  \\"The power of cell-cell adhesion to mould the developing body is startling.\\"<br /><br />In the next chapter, the author examines the powerful homeotic genes and signaling proteins such as 'sonic hedgehog,' employing some gruesome examples of what can go wrong during the formation of the neural tube and other body parts.  Human and animal Cyclops, as well as other mutations such as 'mermaids' are outcomes of control processes gone wrong.  Sonic hedgehog-defective infants have a single cerebral hemisphere, hence one eye.  \\"Mice in which the sonic hedgehog gene has been completely disabled have malformed hearts, lungs, kidneys and guts.  They are always stillborn and have no paws...\\"<br /><br />I certainly wouldn't recommend this book to a pregnant friend.  It's frightening enough to have a vague notion of what might go wrong, without this author's meticulous gene-by-gene guide as to the results of many mutations.<br /><br />Limb buds, skeletons, growth, gender, and skin color are all viewed in turn, through the distorting lens of genes gone wrong.  We are introduced to pigmies, piebalds, cretins, and castrati.<br /><br />The penultimate chapter, \\"The Sober Life (on Ageing)\\" is especially interesting because ageing is something we all do regardless of our original mutational burden.  The author raises the interesting question as to whether death is just another genetic engineering problem.  \\"Were it not for ageing's pervasive effects, 95 per cent of us would celebrate our centenaries; half of us would better the biblical Patriarchs by centuries and live for more than a thousand years.\\"<br /><br />Sir Peter Medawar was the first to suggest that mutations causing fatal errors in old age are not necessarily selected against.  Once we've bred and raised our children, what use has nature for us?<br /><br />The final chapter, \\"Anthropometamorphosis (an Epilogue)\\" ends rather wistfully with a discussion of beauty, and why it may be important for the survival of a species.  Beauty is defined as the absence of imperfections:  \\"the machine errors that arise from the vicissitudes of the womb, childhood, maturity and old age, that are written all over our bodies and that are so ubiquitous that when we see someone who appears to have evaded them, however fleetingly, we pause to look with amazed delight.\\"<br /><br />Read \\"Mutants\\" and you may also find yourself pausing, and looking about with amazed delight.  Armand Marie Leroi does not exploit freaks of mutation so much as he weaves them into the story ofeach of our individual lives.into the story of each of our individual lives. <br />	2005-04-18

He was educated at Oriel College, Oxford, and his mysteries reflect both his scholarship, and the year he spent in Vienna, studying Freudian psychoanalysis.<br /><br />\\"Murder is an Art\\" (1952), also titled \\"A Private View\\" and \\"One Man Show\\" is later Appleby.  Sir John has already been knighted and married, and has worked his way up to the position of Assistant Commissioner at New Scotland Yard.  He and his wife, Lady Judith (a sculptress by profession) play equal roles in solving the double mystery of who murdered the young artist, Gavin Limbert, and who stole two very famous paintings from the Duke of Horton's estate.  (The Duke also plays a prominent role in the early Appleby mystery, \\"Hamlet, Revenge!\\" (1937).)<br /><br />This story begins when Lady Judith drags her unsuspecting husband off to a memorial exhibition of the works of Gavin Limbert, a young artist who was thought to have committed suicide.  When Limbert's `chef d'oeuvre' is stolen from the gallery, right under Appleby's nose, he feels compelled to reopen the case on the painter's mysterious demise.<br /><br />Appleby's assistant, Inspector Cadover is already acquainted with the case and he serves as a stiff upper-lip to his chief's intuitive, sometimes playful method of investigation.  When Appleby disappears after a nocturnal ruckus in a junk shop, Cadover takes over the case and brings it to a successful conclusion---just as he later takes on Appleby's role at New Scotland Yard after Sir John's retirement (for more about Cadover, read \\"The Case of the Journeying Boy\\" by Michael Innes (1949).)<br /><br />This particular Appleby is an equal mixture of mystery and adventure---Appleby personally engages the villains in glorious, but somewhat ignominious battle; Judith hides in a closet and overhears an artist plotting murder, etc.  There is a wonderful chase scene that ends when Lady Judith and the Duke of Horton save Appleby from a particularly appalling fate.<br /><br />Don't let the author's gift for playful, erudite dialogue disguise his mastery of character.  \\"Murder is an Art\\" contains a portrait of an amnesiac young woman that is probably the most sensitive and believable in all of mystery literature (eat your heart out, Dame Agatha!)d the Duke of Horton save Appleby from a particularly appalling fate. <br /> <br />Don't let the author's gift for playful, erudite dialogue disguise his mastery of character.  \\"Murder is an Art\\" contains a portrait of an amnesiac young woman that is probably the most sensitive and believable in all of mystery literature (eat your heart out, Dame Agatha!)  <br />	2005-04-17

This subset of his mystery novels is undoubtedly a byproduct of the many years that Michael Innes (whose real name was John Innes Mackintosh Stewart) spent laboring in the halls of academia.  Among the seats of learning where he taught are Queen's University in Belfast, and the universities of Oxford, Adelaide, and Leeds.<br /><br />The author could not help but involve a legion of eccentric, pompous, and even murderous professors in the death of the president of St. Anthony's College (modeled after the colleges at Oxford University). Their academic spats and bumblings are a good part of what makes this book readable.  Innes is wickedly funny when it comes to poking fun at the habits of his donnish colleagues and undergraduates.<br /><br />\\"Death at the President's Lodging\\" starts out as a locked room mystery where the only suspects are locked into the college grounds for the night.  The president's body is found in his own library, but we gradually learn that the corpse was subject to a great deal of postmortem perambulation as his colleagues try to establish their own alibis and manufacture evidence that points to their academic enemies.  Nothing is as it first seems, not even time of death.<br /><br />As Inspector Appleby winds his way through the skeins of plot and counter-plot created by great intellects gone murderously askew, his intuition is played off against the rather unimaginative plodding of local Constable Dodd.  Dodd is a bit of a dry stick compared to the irrepressible Appleby, who in his very first appearance in this mystery (published in 1936), is already showing signs of what his successor at Scotland Yard refers to as his 'waywardness.'<br /><br />The plot is overly complex, but it is brilliantly resolved and a lot of fun to read.<br /><br />Hamlet, Revenge! (1937)<br /><br />This classical suspense novel might be difficult to follow for readers who are not already familiar with Shakespeare's \\"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince Denmark.\\"<br /><br />However, it is well worth reading, not only for the richly allusive mystery, but also for the characters who create and act out its tragedy.  The author engraves his brittle, upper-class English in diamond-point prose.  He etches their wit with acid.  They are never dull.  To misquote the Bard himself, \\"Age cannot wither Innes's characters, nor murder stale their witty dialogue.\\"<br /><br />For the length of the tragedy at least, the reader will inhabit the manor and precincts of Scamnum Court, principal seat of the Duke of Horton---\\"It is a big place: two counties away it has a sort of little brother in Blenheim Palace.\\"<br /><br />Everything in \\"Hamlet, Revenge!\\" is done on a grand scale.  The Duchess of Horton persuades her old friend, the Lord Chancellor of England to act the part of Polonius in her amateur production of \\"Hamlet.\\"  Her husband is cast as Claudius, King of Denmark and she herself plays his Queen.  Their daughter, Elizabeth is Ophelia.  The greatest Shakespearean actor of the day plays the Melancholy Dane.<br /><br />All of the play's characters are put on edge by a series of mysterious messages, culminating in a quotation from \\"Macbeth\\", \\"...there shall be done a deed of dreadful note...\\"  Then the Lord Chancellor is shot to death at the very instant in the play when his character is supposed to die by Hamlet's sword.<br /><br />Appleby is called in to solve a murder that \\"was planned, deliberately and at obvious risk, to take place bang in the middle of a private performance of Hamlet.\\"<br /><br />The Daffodil Affair (1942)<br /><br />Michael Innes plunged off the surreal deep end when he wrote \\"The Daffodil Affair.\\"  Maybe it was because of the war--this Inspector Appleby mystery was published in 1942--or maybe Innes just felt like seeing how far he could venture into the weird and still get published.  All of his mysteries contain eccentricities: usually a farcical character or a setting that is just out of true.  In this particular mystery, characters, plot, and setting are all seen through a glass, cross-eyed.<br /><br />However, if you can swallow the premise that an obscenely wealthy individual is stealing paranormal objects (including a counting horse, a witch, and a haunted house) with the goal of cornering the market on the supernatural, then founding a new religion and ruling the world after the current dust-up (WWII) is ended, you'll enjoy this story.  It has a Grand Guignol climax on the banks of the mighty Amazon River, that includes not only the cab horse, the witch, and the haunted house, but also the phosphorescing ghost of a murdered man.<br /><br />It also has the strangest motive for murder in all of fiction.<br /><br />\\"The Daffodil Affair\\" is vintage Appleby, in spite of its preposterous plot.

Among the seats of learning where he taught are Queen's University in Belfast, and the universities of Oxford, Adelaide, and Leeds.<br /><br />\\"A Question of Queens\\" is not a mystery so much as it is a farcical treasure hunt and an even more farcical love story.  I have to admit that I sneaked a peek at the book's end to make certain that neither of my two favorite characters ended up with the wrong woman.  Innes's young men who graduate from Oxford, aspire to write 'the' Kafkaesque novel, and end up tutoring undergraduates on Higher Literary Forms are bound to be naïve about beautiful, amoral treasure-hunters.<br /><br />The narrator, Colin Clout, BA, B Litt., newly appointed to the Faculty of Arts in the Old Hall is assigned an attic office, still crammed with the lumber of previous generations of Jorys, whose descendents now live in the New Hall.  He is a decent young man (in spite of his unfinished novel in the style of Kafka) and is definitely not the brains of this story.  Those belong to his friend, the librarian, Sadie Sackett, and to a fellow named George Lumb (also a would-be novelist) who is engaged in cataloguing a very neglected library up at New Hall.<br /><br />Libraries are an important part of this story because of the goings-on of two Victorian Jorys, one of whom collected beautiful mistresses, and the other who collected tombs.  They were brothers, and it was the elder and heir who happened to have the slight necrophilous bent.  According to a series of letters from their sister to her old governess (Innes is a dead-on mimic of spinsterish Victorian correspondents), the two brother-collectors embarked upon a wager as to who could bring home the greatest treasure from abroad.<br /><br />The elder Jory looted a tomb and brought back a treasure of gold and jewelry (and incidentally, the Circassian corpse that was wearing the jewelry).  Then the plot darkens.  The necrophilous Jory seems to have swapped his treasure for whatever it was that his younger brother brought home to win the wager.  Or did he?  The modern Jorys, especially one beautiful treasure-hunter named Olivia from the cadet branch of the family, would really like to know whether the swap was made, and incidentally the current hiding place of the looted gold and jewels.<br /><br />The author could not help but involve a legion of eccentric, pompous, and even fake professors in the treasure hunt and their spats and bumblings are a good part of what makes this book sparkle.  Innes is wickedly funny when it comes to poking fun at the habits of his donnish colleagues.<br /><br />In fact, Innes is one of the finest, most unjustly neglected authors from the British Golden Age of Mystery.  If you haven't already discovered him, \\"A Question of Queens\\" is a good place to start among his non-Appleby comedies-of-manners.

This technique makes me think of Hallmark calendars, or the kind of book I'd give my grandmother for Christmas.<br /><br />It's important to note the original 1969 publication date of this book, because one of the most famous of the Supreme Court's rulings involving the conflict between the religious freedom of the Amish versus the requirements of state public schools came under Chief Justice Burger in 1972. It resulted in a victory for three Amish families in rural Wisconsin who were testing the guarantee of religious freedom. They had refused to send their children to public school beyond the eighth grade, asserting that modern secondary education was contrary to the Amish religion and a threat to their children's salvation. \\"The Amish . . . have convincingly demonstrated the sincerity of their religious beliefs,\\" said the Court, and the children were free, after completing elementary school, to follow the centuries-old tradition of learning at home.  We have the Amish to thank for the legality of home-schooling.<br /><br />\\"The Gentle People,\\" published prior to 1972 Supreme Court decision, is still a bit on the defensive when it comes to the Amish style of education.<br /><br />Otherwise, what text there is reveals some fascinating insights into Amish traditions such as courtship and marriage.  Marriages tend to take place in November, after the harvest, and the new bride and groom usually do not live together until the following spring.  Instead, they go visiting every weekend and collect gifts called 'Haus-Dier' from their hosts, who were guests at their wedding.  \\"By springtime all is ready for the couple to set up house-keeping and start raising a large family.\\"<br /><br />Another insight that might startle the normal twenty-first century American psyche:  \\"Once married, the bond between husband and wife tends to be a tie of respect rather than one of love...Affection is believed to be purely a sacred and private matter not to be socialized.  The family purposely ignores it, and the slightest outward display or gesture is viewed with disgust.\\"<br /><br />The chapter on \\"Ordnung (Rules for Living)\\" sets out the biblical verses by which the Amish have built and maintained their culture, including \\"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord...\\" (Eph. 5:22-23).  Limits on schooling are deduced from:  \\"For wisdom of the world is foolishness with God.\\" (1 Cor. 3:19).  The lack of churches or special buildings set aside for worship is taken from Acts 17:24--\\"The Lord of Heaven and Earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Gentle People\\" does not delve deeply into the history of the Amish, but it is an interesting, although slightly out-of-date portrait of these plain, hard-working folks.  The author himself was born into a Mennonite home in the heart of the Lancaster County Amish District, so he certainly possesses the background to delve into the private lives of his subjects, the so-called 'Pennsylvania Dutch.'me all is ready for the couple to set up house-keeping and start raising a large family.\\" <br /> <br />Another insight that might startle the normal twenty-first century American psyche:  \\"Once married, the bond between husband and wife tends to be a tie of respect rather than one of love...Affection is believed to be purely a sacred and private matter not to be socialized.

The following two books are \\"Warlock of the Witch World\\" (1967) and \\"Sorceress of the Witch World\\" (1968).<br /><br />Kaththea Tregarth, born one of three triplets, could link telepathically with her birth-brothers, Kyllan and Kemoc.  At an early age, she was forcibly separated from her brothers and taken to the Place of Silence to be trained in magic by Wise Women of Estcarp.<br /><br />In \\"Three Against the Witch World\\" the triplets escape from witch-ruled Estcarp to the magical land of Escore.  There, they accidentally destroy the false peace that had long abided between the great powers of Light and Dark.  \\"Things awoke and gathered, and the land was troubled...\\" and the three learn that they must fight with the forces of Light, or be utterly annihilated by the Dark.<br /><br />Kyllan, the warrior brother narrates this first book of the trilogy.  After he and his brother free their sister, Kathea from the Witches, they make the long, arduous journey over-mountain to the forbidden lands of the East.  Then Kaththea troubles the land by sending forth a familiar, and Kyllan is magicked and carried away by a creature of the dark in the form of a black stallion.  He almost perishes but for the healing powers of the Lady of Green Silences.  Once he is reunited with his brother and sister, they learn how Kaththea's witchcraft disturbed the magical balance of ancient Escore.  Kyllan returns to Estcarp to recruit new soldiers for the battle to come.<br /><br />Andre Norton was a powerful mythmaker and world-builder (she passed away on 03/17/2005 at age 93), and her fantasies concerning the triplets Kemoc, Kaththea, and Kyllan do not suffer in comparison with Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea books.  In fact, my own personal preference is for Norton's Witch World./>	2005-04-10
282517:US	53084107	R34SFTFXH7DJ7O	B0007FLJ3K	710608627	Near horizons: The story of an insect garden, illustrated with more than 160 photographs by the author	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A minor masterpiece of insect life	Edwin Way Teale won both the Pulitzer Prize and the John Burroughs Medal for distinguished nature writing. If you are interested in the natural history of our land, his 'American Seasons' series is the perfect place to start reading. All of his books, including \\"Near Horizons\\" reflect the philosophy of Thoreau and Muir and the value they placed on the meaning and beauty of the natural world.<br /><br />This author belongs to the same generation of nature writers as Rachel Carson, Loren Eiseley, Sigurd Olson, and Lewis Thomas, but his writing style is less didactic, gentler, more wondering. He shares his adventures in his insect garden, with keen observation and unabashed wonder. This is my favorite among his many books, perhaps because the setting is so intimate: an old orchard where he \\"laid out a garden-plot--paradoxical and topsy-turvy\\" to attract insects.<br /><br />I reread \\"Near Horizons\\" almost every August, when the cicadas are \\"shrilling from the heights of the maples.\\" I used to believe that their shrill wire-chants were messages traveling along the telephone lines, but was disabused of that notion sometime in late childhood. They are fascinating insects, and Teale does them justice with a whole chapter devoted to the \\"Cicada Man\\" of Staten Island. \\"The glinting wings, the fiery eyes, the vast noise and confusion of the insect hordes [seventeen-year cicadas] made a lasting impression on the boy\\" who was to study cicadas for the rest of his life.<br /><br />Another of my favorite chapters is \\"Dinah Was a Mantis,\\" perhaps because the praying mantis is one of my own favorite insects--I can look out the window and see a mantis egg-case swaying on a twig, waiting for warmer weather to hatch out. I witnessed a hatching once and the little mantises scrabbled quickly away from the egg-case before their brothers and sisters devoured them. Teale made a pet of his Dinah. He even took her to a meeting of the Brooklyn Entomological Society, lost her on Broadway, found her again perched on a fire-plug where a crowd of humans had stopped to gawk at her. Teale says he \\"felt like the ignored father of a juvenile star.\\"<br /><br />Almost all of Teale's insects acquire personalities--not the syrupy, sentimental anthropomorphisms of a child's book--but personalities derived from their battles with other insects, their hunt for food, or even their journeys through his insect-garden. They remind him of his own past: \\"How many times friends and school companions, like these nocturnal [beetles] have appeared to follow a trail that stretched clear and straight before them while my own path of existence seemed to wind about, to become shrouded in mist, to branch into a bewildering maze.\\"<br /><br />Like Jean-Henri Fabre (1823 - 1915), who was well known for his popularization of insect natural history, especially in the ten volumes of \\"Souvenirs Entomoligiques,\\" Teale was content to combine acute observation with humanistic philosophy in his own small garden. \\"Near Horizons\\" is a minor masterpiece.y, found her again perched on a fire-plug where a crowd of humans had stopped to gawk at her.

Breathe in, breathe out, and follow Blake Walker as he attempts to track down a missing telepathic twin, with the help of her similarly-gifted sister.<br /><br />\\"Quest Crosstime\\" is a wildly scenic adventure through alternate Earths. One of my favorites---a jewel-like vignette to the main plot---is ruled by turtles whose brainy heads are too large to pull back into their shells.<br /><br />E6525, the alternate Earth where much of the action takes place, had a couple of twists to its history as compared to our own time line:<br /><br />* Richard III won the Battle of Boswell and the Plantagenets continued to rule in England;<br /><br />* Cortez was killed in his final battle with the Aztecs, and the Spanish never established an Empire in the New World.<br /><br />Norton expends a great deal of imagination and verve in creating a successor Aztec Empire that rules North America west of the Mississippi. The action never falters as Blake in his disguise as a trader from New Britain continues his search for the missing twin.<br /><br />I believe the author may have originally planned to write a sequel to \\"Quest Crosstime,\\" as the action ends rather abruptly with some of the Time Wardens still stranded on E6525, and only a handful of the bad guys accounted for. I've checked Andre Norton's web site and no sequel is listed, so if any of her fans know of one, please drop me a line.	2005-04-10

If you are interested in the advances in genetics, \\"Genome\\" is a quick, interesting overview, although it was published in 1999 and is already slightly out-of-date.<br /><br />For instance, the 'final' human genome sequence wasn't published until 2003 (the 'draft' was published in 2001.)  However, genetics is such a fast-moving field, that any book on this subject is automatically out-of-date even as it is going to press.  So read \\"Genome\\" and enjoy!<br /><br />Ridley does not duck the ethical questions concerning the manipulation of the genome.  His final four chapters on chromosomes 19, 20, 21, and 22 are labeled respectively: \\"Prevention;\\" \\"Politics;\\" \\"Eugenics;\\" and \\"Free Will.\\"  It is interesting to note that the inventor of DNA fingerprinting, Alec Jeffreys, believes every citizen's genetic information should be stored on a national data base, but for identification purposes only.  It should not be used to store information about susceptibility to disease for fear that governments and insurance companies will use such data to discriminate against those of us who might be greater health risks because of our genetic profiles.<br /><br />One of Ridley's recurrent themes (the capital letters are his) is that \\"GENES ARE NOT THERE TO CAUSE DISEASES.\\"  So if you do happen to have the gene for 'bad' blood lipids (see chromosome 19), you are not automatically doomed.  In fact, the author argues very forcefully that this is the genetic information that you (not your insurance company) should know, so that you can take preventative life-style measures.<br /><br />On the other hand, you may not want to know if you have the mutated version of the gene that causes Huntington's chorea (see the chapter on chromosome 4, entitled \\"Fate.\\")<br /><br />One of the most heartening stories in \\"Genome\\" concerns the virtual elimination of cystic fibrosis in the American Jewish population:  \\"The Committee for the Prevention of Jewish Genetic Disease organizes the test of schoolchildren's blood.  When matchmakers are later considering a marriage between two young people, they can call a hotline and quote the two anonymous numbers\\" that the boy and girl received when they were tested.  If both are carriers of the same mutation for cystic fibrosis (or Tay-Sachs disease), they are advised not to marry.<br /><br />This policy seems to be working--why not expand this type of genetic testing to the whole population?<br /><br />One small mistake should be noted.  In the chapter on \\"Prevention\\" the author states that, \\"After Fleming found penicillin we were guilty of neglect if we failed to take a dying tubercular patient to the doctor.\\"  Actually penicillin is active only against Gram-positive bacteria and not against Gram-negative species, including 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis' (the cause of tuberculosis).<br /><br />Other than the above, \\"Genome\\" is a very meaty introduction to a chordate in \\"a phylum that survived the Cambrian era 500 million years ago by the skin of its teeth in competition with the brilliantly successful arthropods.\\"  We are lucky to be here, and lucky to have our genetic story told by such an interesting writer.most heartening stories in \\"Genome\\" concerns the virtual elimination of cystic fibrosis in the American Jewish population:  \\"The Committee for the Prevention of Jewish Genetic Disease organizes the test of schoolchildren's blood.

Her first novel was published in 1934, her last in 2005.  Her unusual, detailed world-building skills will be sorely missed.  In \\"Perilous Dreams\\" she builds worlds within worlds, spinning through dreams that might or might not represent real events.<br /><br />All four stories take place in a future where humanity had long ago reached the stars and scattered itself across thousands of planets.  In the city of Ty-Kry, slender sky towers pierce the clouds, the homes of the very rich.  In the same city is the Hive of dreamers, whose occupants have the talent of sharing dreams with their clients.<br /><br />The first story, \\"Toys of Tamisan\\" also appears in Norton's \\"High Sorcery\\" (1970). The heroine, Tamisan is a 'true action dreamer to the tenth power' and she can share her dreams (for a certain fee) with others.  Lord Starrex is a former space voyager who now lies crippled in the midst of luxury.  He can afford the very best Tamisan has to offer and she wants to create a unique fantasy world for him because she senses that he has been everywhere, seen everything, and will not be satisfied with her usual fare.  She hits upon the idea of creating an alternate history of their world, where certain key events can be altered by Tamisan to yield a different present.<br /><br />Unfortunately, once Tamisan and Lord Starrex are plunged into her dream of an alternate history, Tamisan discovers she has lost her ability to manipulate events in her fantasy world.<br /><br />Furthermore, she seems to have misplaced her client.<br /><br />Magic is alive and well in Tamisan's alternate history, and she, herself is one of its practitioners!<br /><br />The adventures of Tamisan and Lord Starrex are continued in the second story, \\"Ship of Mist.\\"  The two find themselves at yet another turning point in the history of their planet.  Lord Starrex inhabits the body of the Lord of a Sea Hold.  Tamisan is his wife and also a Tide-Singer--in other words a sorceress, although she only uses her talent to stay in telepathic contact with her husband, while he sails off to investigate a haunted ship.  Sailors that stay aboard the haunted ship in order to salvage her inevitably disappear without a trace.  When Tamisan loses contact with her husband, she calls upon the sea and two dolphin-like creatures to help her find him.<br /><br />The third story, \\"Get Out of My Dream\\" takes place in the Hive of Dreamers, but with a new character, a no-nonsense Per-Search agent (private detective) named Itlothis Sb Nath.  She has been sent to wake a powerful clan chief out of his dream and get him on a starship bound for Benold, where all hell is going to break loose if he doesn't return.  The only way Itlothis is allowed to do this is to actually enter Oslan Sb Atto's dream and persuade him to wake up to the 'real' world.<br /><br />As you might guess from the title of this story, Itlothis Sb Nath has her work cut out for her.<br /><br />\\"Nightmare\\" is the fourth and final story, and involves special government agents who infiltrate the Hive of Dreamers to discover why so many clients never wake from their dreams.

Unfortunately, he got it into his head every now and then that he had to kill one of his patients.<br /><br />This urge of his was in definite violation of the Hippocratic Oath, not to mention the law of the land, but his wife and colleagues managed to protect him up until the day the voice in his head commanded him to run over two people on a jogging path.<br /><br />The title of this book \\"Without Mercy\\" holds true for almost all of its characters, including the murderous Dr. John Kappler, and for the author himself who showed no mercy on Dr. Kappler's family when he wrote this true crime book.  Nor did the jury show mercy on Dr. Kappler, who secretly attempted to kill three of his patients--including a pregnant woman who suffered permanent brain damage from his ministrations.  The jurors did not believe Dr. Kappler was insane when he drove up onto the jogging path and killed a promising young psychiatrist, then permanently maimed a young mother.<br /><br />The author is a psychiatrist and a friend of the young doctor who was killed on the jogging path, and wrote this book in spite of the opposition from Dr. Kappler's family.  In fact, Dr. Kappler's wife is portrayed as one of the chief villains for her role in covering up her husband's tendency to murder.  I thought this was a bit unfair, since her response to his bouts of madness was to hospitalize him and make sure he took his medications until he seemed normal again.  I think she was hoping that her husband would regain his sanity, and their family life could go on as before.  I can see my own mother putting on blinders and doing and hoping just what Mrs. Kappler did.<br /><br />On the other hand, the young psychiatrist might still be alive if Mrs. Kappler had been completely honest about her husband's condition.  Judge for yourself, and read the testimony of the psychiatrists who testified at Dr. Kappler's trial.<br /><br />\\"Without Mercy\\" is more of a psychological portrait than most true crime books, and suffers from a languid second half when the psychiatrists are testifying.  However it also gives the reader a detailed look at how our judicial system treats an obviously mental ill physician.  Perhaps the most frightening part of \\"Without Mercy\\" is the long-term cover-up of Dr. Kappler's homicidal treatment of certain patients--by his own medical colleagues.ed at Dr. Kappler's trial.   <br /> <br />\\"Without Mercy\\" is more of a psychological portrait than most true crime books, and suffers from a languid second half when the psychiatrists are testifying.

Le Guin's Earthsea and Tolkein's Middle Earth, if history is fair to this prolific author.<br /><br />Ully of Coomb Brackett in the Dales was crippled falling out of a tree as a boy (many of Norton's major characters are physically handicapped).  He is asked to pipe for a dance on Midsummer's Eve, but a bully steals his musical instrument and drives him away.  Ully is then given the opportunity to offer up his music to another, much stranger group of dancers.<br /><br />Three of this collection's stories are complete stand-alones as far as setting, although \\"Wizard's World\\" comes very close to being a Witch World novelette.  The hero, Craike tries to commit suicide when he is hunted down on our future Earth because of his Esper talents.  He leaps from a cliff--and instead of dying, finds himself transported to an alternate world where unusual mental abilities are a bit more commonplace.  Still there are the hunters and the hunted, and Craike automatically sides with a shape-changed sorceress when she is being driven to her death by the notorious Black Hoods.<br /><br />\\"Through the Needle's Eye\\" matches a lonely teenager who has been lamed by polio with old Miss Ruthevan, who was crippled in a driving accident in her long-ago youth.  Miss Ruthevan possesses wondrous skills with her embroidery needle.  Her finished works look disturbingly real.  She offers to teach young Ernestine how to embroider, but warns her that such gifts come with a price.  Ernestine must decide whether she is willing to pay that price.<br /><br />\\"By a Hair\\" is the least successful story in this collection.  It takes place in an unnamed Baltic country during and after World War II, when the Nazi invaders are replaced by Russian troops.  Countess Ana returns from a Nazi concentration camp, her body deformed and her youth fled, to discover that \\"where the Nazi had strutted in his pride, the Bear of the north shambled, and stamped into red dust those who defied him.\\"  When the beautiful Dagmar betrays her partisan lover to the Russian Colonel, Countess Ana and the midwife, Mald quietly seek revenge.<br /><br />The novelette, \\"Toys of Tamisan\\" also appears in Norton's \\"Perilous Dreams\\" (1976).

Zurich, Switzerland was the original home of the Anabaptists who disagreed with the 'mainstream' Protestants of the time over infant baptism.

They also renounced oaths, reveling and drunkenness, the use of force in war or civil government, and personal adornment.<br /><br />These practices did not make them popular with their fellow Protestants or the local rulers, and the book \\"Martyr's Mirror\\" records the persecutions of this period.  Gradually, the Anabaptists split apart into the Mennonites, Amish (mainly because of disagreements over the practice of shunning), and Hutterites, and migrated to America and Canada.<br /><br />Currently the Mennonites live in forty different countries, which is one thing that differentiates them from the Amish, who stick pretty close to home in North America.  The Mennonites are more like the Society of Friends in this respect, as they are heavily into works of charity in less fortunate nations.  They are also more urbanized than the Amish (not more than 20 percent of American Mennonite households are engaged in farming), and Mennonite youngsters are encouraged to go on to high school and college, whereas Amish youngsters stop schooling after eighth grade.<br /><br />The Mennonites themselves are split into 'plain' and 'fancy' church groups.  \\"Divisions among the Old Order Mennonites have given rise to such special subgroups as the 'Black Bumper' Mennonites who are allowed automobiles, if everything, including the chrome, is painted black.\\"<br /><br />The author paints quite an interesting history and sociology of the Mennonites in the forty plus pages of this booklet.

If you think you'd enjoy an 'alternate history' background where the Anglo-French Empire is ruled by descendants of King Richard the Lion-Hearted--who didn't die of an arrow wound in 1199--and where magic is commonplace, along with gas lights and steam engines, then you should enjoy this adventure in detection and magic.  The atmosphere is very royalist--in a pinch, \\"the Royal Blood of England always came through\\"--and very Catholic.  Evidently Martin Luther didn't nail his ninety-five theses to the door of the Wittenberg Church in this alternate reality.  Lord Darcy himself is a bit of a stuffed shirt, and the author is always bringing in other characters to extol his 'deductive genius' (note to author:  show us, don't tell us).  However, the Sorcerer Sean is a very ingratiating Irishman who serves to balance Lord Darcy's stuffiness.  The mystery is hard to solve unless you're a magician, but I enjoyed it anyway.<br /><br />\\"Too Many Magicians\\" takes place in London during the Triennial Convention of Healers and Sorcerers.  A powerful sorcerer is murdered behind the locked door of his hotel room at the convention, and Master Sean is thrown into the Tower of London as the chief suspect.  Lord Darcy manages to get his Chief Sorcerer out of prison, and the body count keeps piling up as they search for the man who is selling Royal Naval secrets to agents of the wicked Polish Empire.<br /><br />NOTE:  you might be better off purchasing \\"Lord Darcy\\" instead of \\"Too Many Magicians\\" because the former volume contains eight short stories plus this full-length novel.	2005-03-27

The naturalist Edwin Way Teale wrote four books about his and his wife's 100,000-mile journey that crisscrossed America and its seasons: \\"North With the Spring\\" (1951); \\"Autumn Across America\\" (1956); \\"Journey into Summer\\" (1960); and \\"Wandering Through Winter\\" (1965). In nearly 1400 pages this quartet of books takes the reader off the beaten paths and onto a grand tour of the natural history of this country. The only other books I know of that are remotely similar to these are John McPhee's geological grand tour of the 40th Parallel, \\"Annals of the Former World\\" (formerly published as a four-volume set).<br /><br />If Annie Dillard had abandoned Tinker's Creek and taken a pilgrimage across America, she might have written books comparable to Teale's opus magnus.<br /><br />The author and his wife, Nellie are the grandparents everyone should have, pottering about the country, writing reams of lucid prose about their adventures. Teale's warmth and breadth of interests sustain our attention through the beginning of their journey in south Florida, then northward from the Everglades where the orange and tangerine harvests were nearing their end.  The Teales found themselves following the strawberry harvest and great migrations of birds north all the way to New England. The pace might seem a bit stately to some readers, but Nature is stately. This is a trait that ought to belong to naturalists. It is the antithesis of the TV generation's notoriously short attention span.<br /><br />Nellie and Edwin linger not only in Trillium-covered glens, seashell islands, and flatlands where \\"pitcher plants by the thousands, sundews in vast numbers, butterworts and their blue spring flowers\\" bloom.  They also spend part of their journey in the Poisoned Hills of Tennessee, in the Ducktown Desert of the Copper Basin.  \\"All the hills were pleasant here less than a hundred years ago.  What had happened?  What had left these slopes around us sterile and lifeless?\\"<br /><br />Until about 1840, Cherokee Indians had occupied the forested hills.  Then the Indians were herded west by General Winfield Scott and white settlers moved in.  They discovered copper, cut down the forests to roast the oar, and sent clouds of sulphur-dioxide spreading over the hills.  Year by year the acidity of the soil increased until nothing would grow.  \\"Left behind like a red flayed carcass, were the raw hills of sterile undersoil.\\"<br /><br />In spite of the beauties in this book--the miles of migrating warblers, the flight-songs of the yellow-throat, trips on mud-boats through Louisiana swamps, and patches of brilliant hawkweed and robin's plantain--this book does not ignore the damage that we have inflicted on our land.  These are the hardest chapters to read, but they must be read.<br /><br />Teale's black-and-white photographs form a meticulous record of their journey through an American spring, including violets, baby cottontail rabbits. and the author amidst a flock of ring-billed gulls at the beginning of his journey.  It is easy to fall in love with these books, and the couple who lived each chapter.  I read them over and over again.0, Cherokee Indians had occupied the forested hills.

The result is very appealing.  I enjoyed my day with the Amish, astounded by the amount of work they achieved, and charmed by the gentle humor with which they accomplished their daily chores.<br /><br />The one-day diaries were recorded during the peak of the harvest and canning season, and Monday was also wash day in most of the Amish households.  From Wyoming to New York, the wash went out onto clotheslines, cows were milked and fed while Orion and the Moon were still bright in the sky, one family--with plenty of help from friends and relatives--was preparing for 500 wedding guests, and of course, children all over the country were bundled off to one-room school-houses on foot, by buggy or school bus.<br /><br />One Amish lady who runs a bulk grocery store in Minnesota sold flour, yeast, oatmeal and a 60-pound pail of corn syrup to another woman who was having \\"church next Sunday and needs to do a lot of baking.\\"  This book lovingly details the breakfasts, dinners, and suppers eaten by the diarists on October 4, 1993 and by the end of the book I was extremely hungry.  One family had 60 guests for a supper that included \\"scalloped potatoes with ham, dressing, ham and cheese sandwiches, vegetable pizza, Jell-O apple salad, cream cheese pudding, cherry and raspberry pie and ice cream.\\"  Plain food you might say, but abundant and home-cooked.<br /><br />Of all the books I've read about the Amish, 'A Day in the Life' is the most interesting and enjoyable.  It is the only book, the editor is proud to announce, with a map that shows locations in America where the Amish have formed communities.  The largest concentrations of Amish are found in the Great Lakes states, but there are also settlements in the far northwestern corner of Montana, and the southern plains of Texas.  In all, 22 states and one Canadian province are home to these industrious, plain-dealing folks.the southern plains of Texas.

Robert Redford talks about his (horseless) childhood and why and how he learned to ride.  The other stars that Rappaport and Wilkinson interview and photograph are Gisele Bundchen (super model from Brazil), Chevy Chase, Robert Duvall, Richard Gere (who raises Appaloosas), Melissa Gilbert and Bruce Boxleitner, Whoopi Goldberg (who currently doesn't own any horses, so was photographed with NYC's finest mounted police), Kelse and Camille Grammer, Joe and Billie Perry (Friesians), Katharine Ross and Cleo Elliott, Jane Seymour (who prefers driving to riding), Maria Shriver, Robert Wagner and Jill St. John, Jeff Bridges, Christie Brinkley, William Devane, Morgan Freeman, Kim Novak, Jack Palance, and Dennis Quaid.<br /><br />The book has two other, shorter sections titled \\"Pro and Show\\" and \\"Healing Hands, Healing Horses.\\"  My favorite interview was with ex-jockey Julie Krone.  What a gutsy, determined athelete!  There are also short articles on the U. S. Equestrian Team, Dressage, and horse healer Buck Brannaman.<br /><br />\\"People We Know, Horses They Love\\" is a pleasant hodge-podge.  I would recommend it to star-struck teenagers who also happen to love horses.	2005-03-26

Before his sister can inherit his title, she must be cleared of his murder.  There just happens to be a Black Sorcerer visiting the castle who learns that the Count D'Evreux tried to seduce his wife.<br /><br />\\"A Case of Identity\\"--Agents of the wicked Polish Empire are spreading a rumor that it isn't safe to cross the Atlantic Ocean.  There does seem to be a problem, since ships sailing from Imperial European ports to the New World are never heard from again.  One of Prince Richard's secret agents is murdered, the Marquis of Cherbourg disappears under mysterious circumstances, and both events seem somehow connected to the so-called 'Atlantic Curse.'<br /><br />\\"The Muddle of the Woad\\"--Lord Darcy, whose usual duties keep him in Normandy takes a vacation to England.

The son of a town sheriff, he grew up above the Arctic Circle in the city of Tromsø, where his youthful impressions of the wild sea-going life provided material for many of the stories in this collection, first published in 1893. \\"Weird Tales from Northern Seas\\" was originally written in Danish, which was the official language of Norway for many centuries.<br /><br />As you might expect from your reading of the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen these tales of the Northern Seas are not only weird, but grim. Grimmer than Grimm I should say. The supernatural beings that haunt the shores and depths of the sea are uniformly malignant--including the merfolk. Even a seal \\"looked so evilly and viciously at him with its bloodshot eyes...that Elias thought he should have died on the spot for sheer fright.\\"<br /><br />Of course, the seal turns out to be a 'draug'--a demon peculiar to the northern Norwegian coast. In revenge for a wound that Elias had inflicted on it, the draug lures the fisherman's entire family out to sea and kills all but one in a peculiarly horrible manner.<br /><br />And that's just the first story in this book. \\"Finn Blood\\" which the editor refers to as \\"a charming love story\\" is filled with Finn-bashing, evil magic, and of course, draugs. This story has a great line that summarizes the atmosphere of the whole book:' \\"He ...laughed and grinned complacently at his own narrations, the humor of which was always a wreck or a drowning.\\"<br /><br />Grim as it may be, this is a wild and wonderful collection of eleven tales that are filled with the sound and deadly magic of the far North.	2005-03-20

The World's Worst Natural Disasters	Books	3	2	2	N	Y	Disaster lite	The thing that attracted me to this book was the blurb on the back cover:  \\"Easy-to-follow explanations help you understand the underlying causes of all types of disaster, from volcanic eruptions and tornadoes to runaway fires and worldwide epidemics.\\"<br /><br />Alas, the easy-to-follow explanations never go deeper than the Sunday-supplement level, but 'Devastation!' is a very cheerful (if that adjective can be applied to disaster books), colorful, quick read with lots of photographs.<br /><br />The latter part of 'Devastation!' is taken up with a gazetteer that divides the world (excluding the arctic and Antarctic) into eight maps, and plots over 500 disasters on the maps.  One possible lesson to be gained is that people who want to die peacefully in bed should never live near the coast of anything.  Of course, this clustering of dots is a bit of an optical illusion since interior disasters are harder to show as points on a map.  These include tornadoes, plagues, droughts, famines, fires, and something the author calls 'space threats.'<br /><br />The main part of the book is interesting, but arranged in a rather confusing fashion.  For instance, the section on ice ages and mass extinctions, e.g. the Cretaceous Extinction, is preceded by \\"Avalanches and Landslides.\\"  These are all natural disasters, but there is a vast difference of scale.  Another example of this uneasy combination of scale is a section misnamed \\"Patterns of Chaos\\" which combines the American Dust Bowl (1930s), Pleistocene Ice Epoch (1.65 million years ago to 10,000 years ago), Mississippi River floods (1993),  Cretaceous Extinction (65 million years ago), North Sea flooding (1953), Cote d'Azur fires (1985), Gomeç avalanches (1992), Ethiopian drought and famine (1981 - 1985), Permian Extinction (250 million years ago), Yangtze River floods (1991), and the Australian Ash Wednesday fires (1983).<br /><br />Chaos?  Yes!  Pattern?  No!<br /><br />\\"Devastation!\\" is a chaotically organized book, but easy and fun to read.  You might at least want to find it in the oversized books section of your library and browse through the photographs.book, but easy and fun to read.

In Lehmann's obituary, Martin Bernheimer (\\"Los Angeles Times:\\" September 5, 1976) speaks of the German soprano's master classes:  \\"She commanded the stage, even in a classroom, with uncanny force. She was not particularly flexible, however, when it came to developing and encouraging an interpretation that might have conflicted with her own.\\"<br /><br />I think it was inevitable that these two strong-willed singers would clash.  Marilyn didn't get her nickname, 'General Horne' just from the military trouser-roles she played.  Her biography refers to her as \\"one of the few singers ever who could be both charmingly unaffected and magisterial.\\"  Most operatic biographies are repetitions of the theme, 'I came, I sang, I got rave reviews' but Marilyn Horne is a real human being in this book--warts, marital woes, and all.  She manages to balance the 'General' with something her father once told her:  \\"Whenever you think that you are getting too big for the people around you, remember all that separates you from the guy sitting next to you is a little piece of gristle in your throat.\\"<br /><br />She has been called \\"probably the greatest singer in the world\\" (Opera News, 1981).

This is a mouth-watering introduction to the different types of oranges, and how various humans consume them.  Then, in the following chapter the author takes us to the geographical heart of his story in a Florida orange grove.<br /><br />All is not sweetness and orange juice in this book, which was written when LBJ was President.  Frozen orange juice concentrate was make large inroads into the fresh orange market, much to McPhee's dismay.  He stopped at a Florida Welcome Station on his way into the state, and was given \\"a three-ounce cup of reconstituted concentrate.\\"  The motel where he stayed also served reconstituted orange juice so McPhee finally had to buy himself a plastic orange reamer and a knife, and pick his own oranges from a nearby grove.<br /><br />We meet the 'Orange Men' in the following chapter and learn the details of the citrus-growing industry.  You might think this is the boring bit, but nothing McPhee writes is ever boring.  Pomologists are an eccentric lot, most of them migrants to Florida from cold places like Kansas, Minnesota, and Great Britain.  At the time this book was written, Englishman William Grierson, Ph.D, a former officer in the Royal Air Force, was \\"trying to keep growers and shippers interested in fresh fruit...despite the tidal rise of concentrate.\\"  He considered himself \\"the leader of His Majesty's loyal opposition.\\"<br /><br />We also learn from Grierson that, \\"a citrus fruit is, botanically, a berry\\" and \\"The sex life of citrus is something fantastic.\\" (Citrus is so genetically perverse that oranges can grow from lime seeds.)  By this part of the book you will be up to your ears in sweet and bitter oranges, grapefruits, lemons, tangerines, limequats, citrons, and Persian Limes.  If you haven't already run out to the kitchen for a citrus fix, you're made of sterner stuff than I am.<br /><br />McPhee wanders (as only he can) through the history of citrus, the orangeries of European nobility, the Indian River orange groves, the production of reconstituted orange juice, and throws in a riff on Minute Maid and the old-time orange barons.  Go ahead, settle down and drink in this author's delicious prose.  His books are much more satisfying than novels.made of sterner stuff than I am. <br /> <br />McPhee wanders (as only he can) through the history of citrus, the orangeries of European nobility, the Indian River orange groves, the production of reconstituted orange juice, and throws in a riff on Minute Maid and the old-time orange barons.

321685:US	53084107	R1IZIUBJNEDK77	B0007EB24C	128528812	Near Horizons: The Story of an Insect Garden	Books	5	7	7	N	N	A banquet-hall for the six-legged	Edwin Way Teale won both the Pulitzer Prize and the John Burroughs Medal for distinguished nature writing.  If you are interested in the natural history of our land, his 'American Seasons' series is the perfect place to start reading.  All of his books, including \\"Near Horizons\\" reflect the philosophy of Thoreau and Muir and the value they placed on the meaning and beauty of the natural world.<br /><br />This author belongs to the same generation of nature writers as Rachel Carson, Loren Eiseley, Sigurd Olson, and Lewis Thomas, but his writing style is less didactic, gentler, more wondering.  He shares his adventures in his insect garden, with keen observation and unabashed wonder.  This is my favorite among his many books, perhaps because the setting is so intimate:  an old orchard where he \\"laid out a garden-plot--paradoxical and topsy-turvy\\" to attract insects.<br /><br />I reread \\"Near Horizons\\" almost every August, when the cicadas are \\"shrilling from the heights of the maples.\\"  I used to believe that their shrill wire-chants were messages traveling along the telephone lines, but was disabused of that notion sometime in late childhood.  They are fascinating insects, and Teale does them justice with a whole chapter devoted to the \\"Cicada Man\\" of Staten Island.  \\"The glinting wings, the fiery eyes, the vast noise and confusion of the insect hordes [seventeen-year cicadas] made a lasting impression on the boy\\" who was to study cicadas for the rest of his life.<br /><br />Another of my favorite chapters is \\"Dinah Was a Mantis,\\" perhaps because the praying mantis is one of my own favorite insects--I can look out the window and see a mantis egg-case swaying on a twig, waiting for warmer weather to hatch out.  I witnessed a hatching once and the little mantises scrabbled quickly away from the egg-case before their brothers and sisters devoured them.  Teale made a pet of his Dinah.  He even took her to a meeting of the Brooklyn Entomological Society, lost her on Broadway, found her again perched on a fire-plug where a crowd of humans had stopped to gawk at her.  Teale says he \\"felt like the ignored father of a juvenile star.\\"<br /><br />Almost all of Teale's insects acquire personalities--not the syrupy, sentimental anthropomorphisms of a child's book--but personalities derived from their battles with other insects, their hunt for food, or even their journeys through his insect-garden.  They remind him of his own past:  \\"How many times friends and school companions, like these nocturnal  [beetles] have appeared to follow a trail that stretched clear and straight before them while my own path of existence seemed to wind about, to become shrouded in mist, to branch into a bewildering maze.\\"<br /><br />Like Jean-Henri Fabre (1823 - 1915), who was well known for his popularization of insect natural history, especially in the ten volumes of \\"Souvenirs Entomoligiques,\\" Teale was content to combine acute observation with humanistic philosophy in his own small garden.  \\"Near Horizons\\" is a minor masterpiece.Broadway, found her again perched on a fire-plug where a crowd of humans had stopped to gawk at her.

When she is bad she writes sentences like:  \\"Varka grinned, then laughed shrilly as she fell dead at his feet.\\"<br /><br />The hero Varka is hell on women in \\"The Book of Paradox.\\"  All of the women he loves and/or beds end up dead, including the blind, mute woman who was carrying his child.  Think of Varka as a masculine Alice in Wonderland.  He falls down the equivalent of a rabbit hole, and interacts with very strange characters, including a Blue Queen and a deck of cards.  However, Varka is devoid of Alice's intellect, manners, or ironic sense of humor.  In spite of the homicides he commits, he is a petulant, snivelling wimp who is helped on his way by many kind, though eccentric strangers.  Heck, if I were the Blue Queen I would have murdered his butt rather than raise the blind, mute woman from the dead to give Varka the next clue on his journey to Limbo.<br /><br />Of course, maybe the Blue Queen did murder him---I couldn't quite figure out what happened to Varka at book's end.<br /><br />One very important hint: keep track of the characters' hair color.  For instance Darxes, Lord of the Underworld starts out with black hair and beard.  Varka is blonde.  Remember that, and maybe the last chapter will make some sense.<br /><br />Mainly \\"The Book of Paradox\\" is about the Tarot.  Each step (i.e. chapter) of Varka's journey is governed by a different Tarot card, which is why the plot is so chopped up and the characters so, well--cardboard.  The author is more interested in relating each of the book's twenty-two chapters to a different Tarot card, than she is in plot or character.<br /><br />\\"The Book of Paradox\\" would make an interesting mnemonic for learning the Tarot, if that is the reader's inclination, which is the only reason why I gave it two stars.	2005-03-08

It's not just about the Amish, even though they might be the most recognizable.<br /><br />The religion of the Plain people originates in sixteenth century Europe coincident with the beginning of the Protestant reformation.  Zurich, Switzerland was the original home of the Anabaptists who disagreed with the 'mainstream' Protestants of the time over infant baptism.  The Anabaptists believed that baptism should only be conferred on adults who were willing to following the disciplines of the new Church.  They also renounced oaths, reveling and drunkenness, the use of force in war or civil government, and personal adornment.<br /><br />These practices did not make them popular with their fellow Protestants or the local rulers, and the book \\"Martyr's Mirror\\" records the persecutions of this period.  Gradually, the Anabaptists split apart into the Mennonites, Amish (mainly because of disagreements over the practice of shunning), and Hutterites and migrated to America and Canada.  The Hutterites seem most at home on the Great Plains, where they can practice their communal style of life on the vast acreage it takes to grow grain crops.  The Amish and Mennonites, who do not practice communal living seem more at ease with dairy and truck farming.<br /><br />This book defines the Plain lifestyles both in photographs and words, right down to barn-raisings and favorite quilting patterns.  There is even a recipe for shoo-fly pie.  One of my favorite photographs shows the laundry drying on an Amish clothesline in the middle of a snowstorm.  I can see the same type of laundry every time I take the back roads into town (except on Sunday).  The author is right, though:  the Amish have discovered polyester knit fabrics in a big way.  Turquoise polyester turtlenecks are a big item on the Amish clotheslines in this area.  It's charming to think that under all that black there lurks a spot of turquoise.<br /><br />The author carefully differentiates between various sects of Plain folk such as the Stauffer fellowship Mennonites and the Noah Hoover group.  For an outsider like me, reading about these distinctions is like looking at a fractal image.  Viewed microscopically or macroscopically, the similarities are more evident than the differences.<br /><br />Even though the Plain people don't make an effort to convert outsiders to their way of life, their numbers are increasing.  When I was a child, I don't think there were any Amish in my county.  Now every parking lot in town has at least one hitching post for horse-drawn vehicles.  The Amish seem to be much more efficient at farming the land up here than the 'English' (that's the rest of us), and all I have to say about that is, 'Hurray for horse-power!'discovered polyester knit fabrics in a big way.

Since childhood, I've spent many a pleasant hour in the museum (mainly in the Ancient Art and Islamic Art wing surrounding the Rivera Court), and also collaborated with the DIA and Wayne State University on a computer/art project that became my Master's Thesis.  This guidebook highlights over 700 of the more than 65,000 works of art from all areas of the DIA.  It was written by the museum's curatorial staff and edited by Julia P. Henshaw, who is the DIA Director of Publications.<br /><br />This beautifully-bound, well-organized, hardcover guide is illustrated with over 800 color images.  It begins with directions on how to use the book, a historical time-line of how the museum came into being (lots of bequests from the Fords, Dodges, Firestones and other prominent Detroiters), and a colored layout of the museum building.  Information on how to get to the DIA, where to park, classes and lectures, shops, tours, and volunteer opportunities is also included.<br /><br />The main sections of this guide highlight the permanent collections.  They are:  \\"African, Oceanic, and New World Art;\\" \\"Ancient Art and Islamic Art;\\" \\"Asian Art;\\" \\"European Art;\\" \\"Graphic Arts;\\" \\"Twentieth-Century Art;\\" and \\"Film and Video.\\"<br /><br />Each section tells many well-illustrated stories.  For instance, under \\"African, Oceanic, and New World Art\\" there is an article, \\"Men Who Dance as Women:\\"<br /><br />\\"In initiation ceremonies female masks used in traditional African cultures are almost always worn by men who portray the important mythological role of females.  Most of these male initiation societies are secret; women are strictly forbidden to handle or even see the wearers of these masks.\\"<br /><br />The introduction is followed by illustrations of masks from the Chokwe, Mende, and Makonde tribes with text illuminating the history, construction, and use of each mask.<br /><br />All of the DIA's major works of art are included, from Rivera's \\"Detroit Industry\\" fresco cycle to the Matisse \\"Poppies\\" painting.<br /><br />This book is not only a guide to a particular museum, it also can be read like an issue of the \\"Smithsonian\\" Magazine, where experts select and describe some of their favorite works of art.

For instance, Volume 1 jumps around from Bluebeard to Karen Silkwood to the Scarsdale Diet Doctor murder to the Salem Witch trials.  Each article in itself is interesting, detailed, and illustrated with black-and-white photographs and drawings.  However, no author is given.  Most of the cases discussed come from the United States and Great Britain, although a few European criminals are included.<br /><br />Volume 2 concerns itself with gangsters but also records the crimes of serial killers such as Jack the Ripper and the Hillside Strangler.<br /><br />Volume 3 veers off into spy stories, and \\"Operation Madam Kitty\\" which was a Nazi-operated brothel in Berlin during World War II where many diplomats unwittingly recorded their deepest feelings concerning Hitler.  There is also an article on the philosopher, Jeremy Bentham and his ideas on prison reform--and a photograph of his seated 'auto-ikon' (articulated and clothed skeleton plus death-mask) with his actual head resting between his feet.  This bizarre display can be found in the university that he founded.  \\"So great was the philosopher's own enthusiasm [for auto-ikons] that he even had a special pair of glass eyes made to match his living ones, to be fitted into his empty eye sockets after death; he unnerved friends by absent-mindedly rolling them around on the table at dinner.\\"<br /><br />Volume 4 ranges from \\"The Most Haunted House in England\\" to the Nuremburg war crimes trials.<br /><br />Volume 5 continues the war crimes theme with \\"The Nazi Hunter\\" but also includes articles on Wild Bill Hickok and the Manson Family, who had previously made their bow in Volume 1.<br /><br />Volume 6 has several articles on Interpol, but also features the body-snatchers Burk and Hare, who also show up in \\"Together They Slay\\" in Volume 1.<br /><br />Volume 7 includes several FBI cases plus \\"The Trial of Captain Kidd\\" interspersed among various assassinations.<br /><br />Volume 8 aspires to an alphabetical sequence starting with \\"Alcatraz\\" and ending with \\"Witches,\\" \\"X-Rays,\\" \\"Yellow Kid,\\" and \\"Zimmerman.\\"  At least, I was able to figure out the organizational technique of this last volume.<br /><br />The (unnamed) writers are supposedly \\"experts in their various fields, using the full range of their knowledge and talent as they explore the minds of psychopathic killers...\\"  The range of the articles is truly astounding and not a little eccentric.

If you haven't already read \\"Sabriel\\", you might want to put \\"Lirael\\" aside and begin at the beginning.  The middle book could stand alone, especially the story of Lirael herself, but you will miss nuances of the Philosophy and Geography of Death if you don't start with \\"Sabriel\\".  The only work I can compare this series to is Philip Pullman's \\"Golden Compass\\" trilogy, although I prefer Nix's magical world-building.  If I ever die and go to fantasy heaven, I hope it resembles his immense library beneath glacier and mountain, where each door opens into a separate mystery.  In the catacombs beneath the library, Lirael discovers how to turn herself into an ice otter or a barking owl, reads \\"The Book of Remembrance and Forgetting\\", and duels with the monstrous Stilken.<br /><br />However, \\"Lirael\\" isn't just about Lirael.  Prince Sameth, heir apparent to Sabriel as the Old Kingdom's champion against evil necromancers, also comes of age in this volume.  There are plenty of evil necromancers to go around.  In fact, at the end of this book, it appears as though they are winning the war to turn the Old Kingdom into a kingdom of the dead.<br /><br />One fault should be noted. The two main characters spend too much text feeling sorry for themselves.  Lirael pursues an impossible dream, while Prince Sameth tries to escape from an impossible nightmare.  I think the author's editor must have read \\"Sabriel\\" and said, \\"Garth, this is a great fantasy but your heroine, Sabriel is pretty darn self-sufficient.  Readers can't relate to that.  You need to make your characters more vulnerable.\\"  So that's exactly what Nix did in Volume Two.  Vulnerability often shades over into self-pity in \\"Lirael\\"---too often for my liking.  It's not enough of an annoyance to bypass this fantasy.  Hopefully, in the yet-to-be-published \\"Abhorsen\\", Lirael and Prince Sameth will stop whining and take up the burden of defending the Old Kingdom.  Lirael is already headed in that direction, along with her friend the Disreputable Dog.<br /><br />Garth, I advise you to stop listening to your editor.  You were pitch-perfect in \\"Sabriel\\". Retune `Astarael, the Sorrowful' that \\"casts all who hear it deep into Death\\" and finish this marvelous trilogy the way you began it.<br /><br />NOTE:  the 'adult' version has exactly the same text as earlier printings of this book.

Read \\"Sabriel\\" and \\"Lirael\\" before undertaking \\"Abhorsen,\\" so that you can familiarize yourself with the Philosophy and Geography of Death.  Nix isn't into summarization or repetition. He plunges his reader right into a whirlpool of death, animated corpses, and Charter magic.  If you don't already know such characters as the Disreputable Dog, the necromancer Hedge, or his bone-headed companion, Nick, you might never figure out what's going on.<br /><br />This book is a direct continuation of \\"Lirael,\\" with the ex-assistant librarian and her companion, Prince Sameth carrying on the battle against Hedge and the evil he is digging up at Red Lake.  Although Prince Sameth was meant to be the Abhorsen-in-Waiting, heir to the powers of 'The Book of the Dead' and the seven bells, Lirael now takes up that role, and Sam seeks his destiny as a descendant of the mysterious Wallmakers, who built the barrier between the magical Old Kingdom and the mundane kingdom of Ancelstierre.  The two will need all of the magic they can conjure up against an enemy that threatens not only the Charter, but all living beings.<br /><br />The swirl and cross-currents of life gradually ebb as the dead pass through gate after gate on Garth Nix's nameless river--a river like Styx or Lethe that runs through each of our subconscious underworlds as a legacy of our water-bound gestation.

In nearly 1400 pages this quartet of books takes the reader off the beaten paths and onto a grand tour of the natural history of this country. The only other books I know of that are remotely similar to these are John McPhee's geological grand tour of the 40th Parallel, \\"Annals of the Former World\\" (formerly published as a four-volume set).<br /><br />If Annie Dillard had abandoned Tinker's Creek and taken a pilgrimage across America, she might have written books comparable to Teale's opus magnus.<br /><br />The author and his wife, Nellie are the grandparents everyone should have, pottering about the country, writing reams of lucid prose about their adventures. Teale's warmth and breadth of interests sustain our attention through the beginning of their journey in south Florida, then northward from the Everglades where the orange and tangerine harvests were nearing their end.  The Teales found themselves following the strawberry harvest and great migrations of birds north all the way to New England. The pace might seem a bit stately to some readers, but Nature is stately. This is a trait that ought to belong to naturalists. It is the antithesis of the TV generation's notoriously short attention span.<br /><br />Nellie and Edwin linger not only in Trillium-covered glens, seashell islands, and flatlands where \\"pitcher plants by the thousands, sundews in vast numbers, butterworts and their blue spring flowers\\" bloom.  They also spend part of their journey in the Poisoned Hills of Tennessee, in the Ducktown Desert of the Copper Basin.  \\"All the hills were pleasant here less than a hundred years ago.

Year by year the acidity of the soil increased until nothing would grow.  \\"Left behind like a red flayed carcass, were the raw hills of sterile undersoil.\\"<br /><br />In spite of the beauties in this book--the miles of migrating warblers, the flight-songs of the yellow-throat, trips on mud-boats through Louisiana swamps, and patches of brilliant hawkweed and robin's plantain--this book does not ignore the damage that we have inflicted on our land.

It is easy to fall in love with these books, and the couple who lived each chapter.  I read them over and over again.	2005-02-26

John Dickson Carr was a writer in the \\"Golden Age\\" of mysteries, and he never cheated his readers.  All of the clues needed to solve the mystery are presented, giving the alert reader a chance at identifying the murderer.  I actually figured out who the killer was before the denouement of \\"He Who Whispers\\" even though I had no idea of how the murder was committed.<br /><br />However, his scrupulosity is not my favorite characteristic of this American author.  What I love are the hot-house, claustrophobic, even supernatural atmospheres that he creates in his mysteries.  In \\"He Who Whispers\\" a man is murdered at the top of a medieval French tower when no one could have possibly climbed the tower's sole staircase to accomplish the deed.  His son's fianc&eacute;e is accused of vampirism and barely escapes war-torn France with her life.  She resurfaces in England and takes a position as private librarian at Greywood Mansion in New Forest.  The first night she spends in the house, another woman is nearly frightened to death.<br /><br />Dr. Gideon Fell bumbles and rumbles onto the moonlit grounds of Greywood shortly before the mysterious shot is fired, and he and his French compatriot, Professor Rigaud attempt to solve the mystery of how the sister of Greywood's owner was almost frightened to death in her own bedroom.  Was the beautiful new librarian really a vampire?  Professor Riguad, using a rather convoluted form of Gallic logic believes she is.  It is the only 'logical' explanation of how Howard Brooke was killed on top of the French tower back before the war.<br /><br />However, if you've read enough Gideon Fell mysteries, you know that Carr's humongous detective always manages to find a non-supernatural explanation to the mystery, in spite of the Unspeakable Horror that always seems to lurk just around the corner, breathing its chill vapours through the text.<br /><br />Though Carr was an American most of his books (especially the early ones) were set in England and France.

The magic is not the Harry Potter 'swish and flick' variety, but something altogether strange and beautiful.  Most of the time the heroine, Faris Nallaneen does not even realize she has done anything magical.<br /><br />The setting is an early 20th-century alternate world, where young ladies are sent to Greenlaw College (in 'real' life, the Benedictine Abbey of Mont St. Michael!) to learn Greek, Latin, Deportment, and Magic.  Faris Nallaneen is heir to the small Middle European dukedom of Galazon.  Her uncle, who rules Galazon until Faris's majority sends her kicking and screaming off to Greenlaw until his other secret plan for her future matures.  Naturally Faris resents this, but she slowly begins to make friends at school and also acquires one mortal enemy, a distant relative named Menary.<br /><br />Menary is one of the more interesting students at Greenlaw College.  She possesses a wild magic, whose source is unknown to her teachers.  She is also fond of anything in trousers, but very unfortunate things happen to her lovers.  She is finally expelled on the morning after Faris's magical vigil, after turning Faris's friend, Tyrian into a tomcat.  Our heroine loses her temper and sets Menary's hair on fire:<br /><br />\\"It was not natural fire, Faris realized...It blazed pale gold and green, Menary's wild halo.  In its own way, it was beautiful, as cold and strange as the northern lights.\\"<br /><br /> Naturally, after this breach of etiquette, Faris is also asked to leave Greenlaw College.  She sets out on a mission to Paris with her friends Jane, a professor at Greenlaw, and Tyrian, who has been restored to his former shape.<br /><br />This would turn out to be a very proper, Edwardian excursion to the City of Lights if it were not for repeated attempts on Faris's life.  She and Jane still manage to get in a bit of clothes shopping, and then Faris meets the man (or ghost) who interprets the results of her all-night vigil of magic, and points her toward her true destiny.<br /><br />Meanwhile, there is a tangled web of Middle European politics to be gotten through, including the discovery of Faris's uncle's plot, more unexpected magic--Jane transforms a bomb into a hat and proceeds to wear it, thrones to be won and lost, and a love story.<br /><br />\\"College of Magics\\" (1994) is a very unexpected and satisfying fantasy for fans of magical alternate history novels, and for those of us who also love a good comedy of manners.

Gail Bell studied pharmacy at the University of Sydney, and has written a fascinating history of the science and sociology of poisoning.  I once did a science project on the natural poisons to be found locally (water hemlock, nightshade, etc.) and found it to be a compelling subject--a close-in look at some of the more ambiguous and dreadful forms of death.  After all, almost anything including water can poison if taken in the 'right' quantity.<br /><br />Gail Bell has a special interest in poisons because her grandfather reputedly murdered two of his sons with strychnine.  The guilt or innocence of her grandfather, William MacBeth is one of the central themes of this book--hence the subtitle 'a Family Memoir.'  The author tells us, \\"By inclination and training I've spent many years thinking about the bad stuff, poison, and its companions:  secrecy, death and storytelling.\\"<br /><br />This isn't merely a family narrative.  We are also informed of other poisonings, both historical (Cleopatra) and fictional (Madame Bovary).  The story of Cleopatra is especially grim, since she reputedly tested many poisons on her slaves before selecting one that would leave her beautiful in death.<br /><br />The 'Queen of Poisons,' arsenic is not neglected although the author calls her \\"a defeated monarch at the end of the twentieth century.\\"  The 'Old Lady' is easily discoverable now, but that doesn't necessarily mean that arsenic is no longer used as a deadly, but slow way to murder one's relatives.  Something that strikes me about the true crime TV shows concerning poisons is that most physicians never think to test for arsenic (or its heavy metal companion, thallium) until the victim is on his or her deathbed, or in the grave.  Doctors who poison their patients are especially liable to get off scot-free until the body-count is too high to ignore.<br /><br />The only parts of \\"Poison\\" that I didn't really enjoy were the author's 'rescue fantasies.'  They involve Madame Bovary, the author's young uncle, Patrick, and a certain Danish king who appeared in one of Shakespeare's plays.  I do believe Ms. Bell satisfactorily solves the mystery of her own grandfather's guilt or innocence, and that alone makes this a very interesting book.oison\\" that I didn't really enjoy were the author's 'rescue fantasies.'

This author never suffers from a dearth of suspects or motives.<br /><br />Judge Horace Ireton is proud of the fact that he administers absolute, impartial justice without a drop of mercy.  At the end of the Westshire spring assizes, he sentences a man to death with all due ceremony--the square of black silk on his wig, the ominous roll of words that end: \\"...and there be hanged by the neck until you are dead.  And may God have mercy on your soul.\\" Then he decides to take a short vacation in his bungalow by the sea.  He challenges the eccentric Dr. Fell to a chess match as part of his R&R program, and in pops the judge's daughter and announces that she is engaged to be married--and not to the dried stick of a barrister whom her father had hand-picked for her.<br /><br />Dr. Fell, who isn't without a clumsy sort of tact lumbers off-scene.  Judge Ireton is introduced to the new fianc&eacute;, whom he recognizes as a man who was once tried and acquitted of extorting money from his previous betrothed's family.  Sure enough, the man offers to back out of his current engagement if the judge sheds enough pounds from his bank account.<br /><br />Twenty-four hours later, a murder occurs under seemingly impossible conditions.  Everyone within a square mile of the judge's bungalow has an excellent motive for doing away with the victim.  It's up to Dr. Fell to play a grim sort of cat-and-mouse game with the real killer and obtain a confession.<br /><br />How did the corpse get from the scene of the murder to the judge's bungalow or did the shooting somehow occur in the bungalow?  Did you know that Canadian taxidermists sometimes stuff their moose heads with sand?  Who is the dried stick of a barrister (who turns out to be a pretty decent sort) really in love with?  Who tries to drown his newly-discovered love in a darkened, subterranean swimming pool?<br /><br />Carr provides lots of interesting side-tracks and tricksy turns, as is usual in his mysteries.(who turns out to be a pretty decent sort) really in love with?

Now that I live in the woods, I can hear owls hooting almost every night, but how can I go about identifying them?  Is there someone out there who is even nuttier about owls than I am?  Someone who has actually spent nights out in the woods with a flashlight and camera, identifying these mysterious birds?  The answer of course, is yes.  Jim Burns, author of \\"North American Owls\\" doesn't write a 'mere' natural history text about these (mostly) nocturnal predators.  He also narrates his journeys of discovery, from Alaska to southern Arizona, usually accompanied by Deva and the bumbles (his wife and two boys).  His stories sing a mysterious, mythical, even mystical nocturne.  He familiarizes us with \\"the more nebulous and mysterious aspects of [the owls'] darker side.\\"<br /><br />Owls are creatures of wisdom, harbingers of death.  Even a naturalist of \\"reputed backcountry acumen and skill feels a little shaky thrashing around in the dead of night chasing ghosts.\\"  The chapter on Long-Eared Owls is written as a poem, and many of the narratives of other North American owls lapse into blank verse.<br /><br />The book's photographs equal the beauty and strangeness of the text.  One photograph of a Short-Eared Owl shows its head rotated so that its beak is pointed at 'two-o'clock.'  I knew owls could swivel their heads around to look over their backs, but I had no idea they could rotate them like the hands of a clock.  I laugh every time I come across this photo.  The photos also capture the predatory nature of owls:  bloody bits of rabbit and mouse dangling from their claws and beaks.<br /><br />The author, Jim Burns, has been photographing birds for over 20 years and many of the pictures in this book are his.  I am guessing from the text that his favorite photograph is one he took of a Northern Pygmy-Owl, silhouetted against a hazy solar disk, mouse clutched in talons--more art than identification photograph.  My own favorite is of a soaring Snowy Owl, because that's the only owl I've ever seen, gliding down the road ahead of me on a cold December evening.  I swear its wings spanned the entire width of the state highway.  Big.  Silent.  Snow-colored.  Eerie.  A visitor from the Arctic that we Michiganders are rarely privileged to see.<br /><br />This book also contains sidebars with identification features, habits, and range/habitat maps.  A CD is included with the book that contains the vocalizations of all nineteen owls included in the text.  My only complaint is that the author did not include his own vocalizations on each track in order to identify the owl that is hooting, screeching, or barking.  You have to follow the track numbers in order to identify the owl--a small complaint indeed, concerning a very fine book.<br /><br />Incidentally, one of the things I learned from this book is that Harry Potter's owl Hedwig is a MALE Snowy Owl.is of a soaring Snowy Owl, because that's the only owl I've ever seen, gliding down the road ahead of me on a cold December evening.

It is also normal for them to stick to a single poison.  But John Dickson Carr really lets loose in this mystery and gives us a dysfunctional family's gourmet guide to poisons--three of them:  arsenic; morphine; and hydrobromide of hyoscin (the infamous Dr. Crippen used hyoscin to dispose of his wife in 1910).<br /><br />In the 1930s, arsenic could be purchased in any pharmacy as a rat poison, but for the latter two poisons to be lying around the mansion, it helps to have a doctor marry in to the family. Sadly enough, the doctor who marries into this family is the third victim to be poisoned and the first to die.<br /><br />A creeping marble hand that has been broken off of a statue of the Emperor Caligula also serves to heighten tensions, especially after two people see it scurrying along window ledges like a big white spider.<br /><br />Jeff Marle, who shows up in many of Carr's Bencolin mysteries as the Parisian juge d'instruction's clueless sidekick, is back in his native Pennsylvania for \\"Poison in Jest.\\"  He is invited over to chez Quayle to critique a manuscript, and almost from the moment he walks through the door, people begin to keel over, including his host.  He stays on to help find the poisoner, assisted by the eccentric fianc&eacute; of Jinny Quayle.  This fianc&eacute; is another Dr. Gideon Fell in very slight disguise, e.g. he isn't fat and he doesn't stomp around with crutches.  However, he does pop up in the oddest corners, muttering mystical clues that don't really shed any light on the murderer's identity.<br /><br />Luckily this Dr. Fell clone dies a-borning--I believe this is the only book where he shows up, thank god.  It wouldn't do to have two of them clumping and mumbling through Carr's mysteries.<br /><br />Read \\"Poison in Jest\\" for its brooding Gothic atmosphere--the marble emperor's detached hand; lights that won't stay on; staircases creaking in the night.

All of the characters act suspiciously, including the true and false heir to the extensive Farnleigh estate (and the title that goes with it), their two lawyers, the butler, Lady Farnleigh, and assorted family friends.  The reader has many reasons to suspect each character in turn after the murder (or was it suicide?) of one of the two competing heirs.  The only person who might be able to tell whether the true John Farnleigh died or still lives is his tutor, Murray who happens to have taken a thumb-o-graph of young John before he was sent away to America to live with a distant relative.<br /><br />John wasn't the heir, but the black sheep of the family when he was packed off to Colorado via the spanking, new ocean liner, 'Titanic.'  He was thought to have died when his ship sank on her maiden voyage, but after his older brother dies without issue, not one but two John Farnleighs show up within a year of each other to claim the family estate and title.  The first one to appear marries John's childhood sweetheart and settles down to manage Farnleigh.<br /><br />Then up pops John Farnleigh #2, one of the competing heirs dies, and someone steals Murray's thumb-o-graph.  The reader is beset with conflicting stories and clues, when Dr. Fell finally lumbers onto the scene with his shovel-hat, swirling cape, and crutch-headed cane.  He figures out who killed whom right away, but the reader is left grasping at hints (some of them pretty darn subtle - I think Carr cheats a little on this mystery) until the final denouement, which involves that fateful night when the 'Titanic' went down.<br /><br />As always with this author, the eerie, suffocating atmosphere surrounding a mysterious death is tinged with an aura of the supernatural.  \\"The Crooked Hinge\\" features devil worship and a horrible old eighteenth-century automaton called, 'The Golden Hag.'  Her sinister appearances alone make this a novel worth savoring, and Carr also provides a meticulously plotted mystery (although I could do without a few of his great detective's tics and his refusal to blab out the name of the murderer as soon as he figures out whodunit.

If Rembrandt had painted horses, they would resemble Arthus-Bertrand's photographs.  When I first came upon the picture of the Russian Heavy Draft stallion Jar, I thought it WAS an oil painting.  Admirers of Stubbs will very much enjoy the portraits in this book.<br /><br />But \\"Horses\\" is not just another beautiful picture book.  It also has a very dense, satisfying text, in the manner of a French natural history:  opinionated; filled with wonderfully obscure facts; and most elegantly written (and translated).  The author does ignore most North American horse breeds such as the Saddlebred and the Tennessee Walker, in a rather snooty Gallic fashion.  Instead, he showcases many African, South American, and French breeds that were completely unknown to me.  To someone who is used to leafing through English and American encyclopedias of horse breeds, this book will be a real eye-opener.  For instance how many readers will have heard of the Augeron, the Kabardin, the Nivernais, the Trait du Maine, or the Auxois?  Would they realize that the oldest horse race in France features the Auxois, which is a Burgundian draft horse?<br /><br />\\"Horses\\" has over 225 color equine portraits taken over the course of fifteen years.  A dark brownish-black backdrop allows the reader to focus on the horse in all of its majesty, and on the relationship between horse and human.  It is truly the most beautiful book in my library.	2005-02-08

You enter a rich world of metaphor, sometimes baffling but always beautiful. A standard hero's quest is overgrown with fabulous beasts, children of stone, and death-dealing harps.<br /><br />In the first book, \\"The Riddle-Master of Hed\\" Land-Ruler Morgon of Hed wins a bride and a crown in a riddling contest with a ghost.  He wipes the cow manure off of his boots and sets sail from his tiny island kingdom, unsure as to whether his beautiful, red-haired prize has any interest in marrying a farmer-king.  In pursuit of an answer, Morgon detours to the College of Riddle-Masters at Caithnard, where he was once a student and where his bride's brother still resides.  His companion for the journey is Deth, the thousand-year-old High One's harpist.<br /><br />Morgon and Deth are shipwrecked, and once Morgon regains his memory he discovers that he has unknown, shape-changing enemies who will stop at nothing to destroy him. As he flees through the kingdoms of his world, he is befriended by the various land-rulers and is gifted with a harp and a sword that are decorated with three stars--identical to the birthmark of stars on his forehead.  He also learns how to change his own shape into beasts and trees.<br /><br />Finally Morgon makes his way to Erlenstar Mountain with Deth, the harpist, hoping that the High One will solve the riddle of his stars and defend him against his implacable enemies.<br /><br />The heir of sea and fire referred to in the title of the second book in the trilogy is Raederle, Morgon of Hed's betrothed.  She struggles against her shape-changer heritage, but gradually begins to tap into its power in order to protect Morgon.  \\"Heir of Sea and Fire\\" begins in the spring of the year \\"following the strange disappearance of the Prince of Hed, who had, with the High One's harpist, vanished like a mist in Isig Pass...\\"<br /><br />Raederle has reason to believe Morgon dead, since the land-rule of Hed has passed to Morgon's brother, Eliard.  Or was land-rule ripped from Morgon while he was still alive?  In a key passage, Raederle asks the High One's harpist, \\"What piece of knowledge did the Founder expect to find beneath the knowledge of when the barley would begin to sprout or what trees in his orchard had a disease eating secretly at their hearts?\\"<br /><br />The importance of the question lies in the inability of the harpist to answer it.<br /><br />There are some great visuals in \\"Heir of Sea and Fire,\\" especially in the sequence where Raederle calls up the dead of An and bargains with them to protect the man who is journeying across their land.  I really feared for her life because of the bargain she made with the dead Kings, even though I've read a million fantasies and the heroine never dies--at least not until the end of the trilogy.<br /><br />In the final book of the trilogy, \\"Harpist in the Wind,\\" the Star-bearer (Morgon of Hed) and Raederle of An, united at last, continue their search for their true identities.  This book won the Locus Award in 1980 and I feel 'award-winning' is the least amount of praise one can apply to this trilogy.

Plus I'm not nearly as fond of the Morgol and her guards as is the author, and they don't add much to the plot.  Perhaps in the years following the publication of this book (1977), we have all become used to spear-wielding maidens.

It's the ultimate gargoyle photo-op.  I'm surprised this author was able to photograph the gargoyles without a tourist leaning between them.  I was only slightly disappointed to learn from this book that much of the stonework on this tower is nineteenth-century restoration by Eug&egrave;ne Viollet-le-Duc, \\"started in 1845 to repair damage done to the cathedral during the Revolution.\\"  However, he did attempt to use molds of the originals.<br /><br />Basically gargoyles are waterspouts, but to me they are proof that medieval stonemasons had a lively sense of humor--which they might have inherited from the Etruscans or the Egyptians, who also used animal-shaped stone waterspouts.  Strictly speaking, gargoyles that do not spout water are known as 'grotesques' or 'chimeras.'<br /><br />It surprised me to learn that gargoyles used to be brightly colored--oranges, reds, and greens were favored--and sometimes gilded.  The author believes that \\"gargoyles may be survivals of pagan beliefs...incorporated into church decorations for superstitious reasons.\\"  I've read many a horror story based on this assumption, most notably \\"The Cambridge Beast\\" and \\"The Sheelagh-na-gig\\" by Mary Ann Allen.<br /><br />Encounters between gargoyles and people are unique to the Cathedral of Saint John in Den Bosch, the Netherlands:  \\"As a monstrous creature leaps out from the top of the buttress, the people cringe in terror, each one leaning back in an attempt to escape the attack of their horrible assailant.\\"  Americans tend to make pets of gargoyles, but that was not their original purpose.  After all, midair is the reputed realm of demons (Ephesians 2:2).<br /><br />Some of the gargoyles pictured in this book are laughing at us.  A carved gargoyle-monk of the Old Cathedral of Saint-Etienne in Toul, France appears to be emptying the contents of a barrel onto his unsuspecting colleagues below.  \\"Some [gargoyles] are so appealing that it is hard to imagine they were intended to be regarded as anything other than good creatures.  Indeed, the gargoyles of Notre-Dame in Paris are even said to keep watch for drowning victims in the Seine.\\"<br /><br />This book is an enchanting collection of photographs, legends, and travelogue.

The same cannot be said of \\"Encyclopedia of Plague and Pestilence,\\" mainly because of the way its subjects are ordered.  I would have been tempted to arrange the encyclopedia by disease, then historical occurrences within the disease category.  Instead, the editor used a strictly alphabetical format that usually begins with the name of a country or city, e.g. \\"African Influenza Epidemic of 1890\\" is followed by \\"Albenga Meningitis Epidemic of 1815.\\"  There are also plagues listed under the names of emperors and saints, e.g. Antonine Plague, Plague of Cyprian, and Plague of Justinian.<br /><br />Luckily, there are several appendices including a \\"Timetable of Plague and Pestilence\\" and a \\"Geographical Appendix.\\"  One of the more interesting entries in the latter appendix is \\"Ancient History\\"--not precisely a geographical entity but containing references to plagues such as the \\"Thasian Mumps Epidemic\\" (c. 410 B.C.), and the \\"Cough of Perinthus\\" (c. 410 B.C.).<br /><br />This book was published in 1995, so it is slightly outdated as far as AIDS (the only entries are for Africa and the United States), and some of the hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, although the Zairian Ebola Epidemic of 1976 is thoroughly covered.  The SARS virus, and the new potential mass killer, the H5N1 avian flu virus are not included, but articles can be found on the H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 influenza outbreaks (if you know to look under headings such as \\"Russian (Red) Influenza Pandemic of 1977-78\\" for H1N1.)<br /><br />The encyclopedic entries generally offer a discussion of how and when an epidemic started, how or why it occurred or spread, whom it affected, and what the eventual outcome was.  Also included (when available) is the number of casualties, symptoms, and historical implications.  For instance, under \\"Dancing Mania (St. John's Dance, St. Vitus's Dance, Tarantism)\\" the author reports that \\"...dancing mania was closely related to the flagellant movement--a cult desperate to find someone or something responsible for the Black Death...\\"<br /><br />The entries in the \\"Encyclopedia of Plague and Pestilence\\" are fascinating to browse, but if you are trying to research a particular disease such as cholera, you will be making heavy use of this book's 8-point-type index.

(One night at a restaurant, I reached out and plunged my dinner knife into the bellows of an approaching accordion; the stricken look on the player's face when the wind was knocked out of his \\"Lady of Spain\\" was well worth the price of damages.)\\"<br /><br />Okay, so my father is a deceased dentist and Dr. Cohn is a 70-something internist, but these men were psychic twins.  This book snaps, crackles, and pops--to borrow the author's phrase when comparing chiropractors to breakfast cereal--although by the end of it, I still hadn't decided whether I'd want Dr. Cohn to be my internist.  He underprescribes pain medications for fear of turning his patients and himself into junkies, but on the other hand (bless you, Dr. Cohn!) he treats gas and lower back pain.  Most internists--well, their eyes glaze over if you complain about gas or lower back pain.<br /><br />Incidentally, the W.B.D. after this author's name stands for \\"World's Best Doctor\\" and in this book he shares fifty-seven short essays on how you too can aspire to be a 'W.B.D.'<br /><br />If laughter truly has the power to lower blood pressure, improve digestion, and help insomnia, you'll be in ruddy good health by the time you reach Dr. Cohn's \\"Afterword\\" which he subtitles \\"You'll Have to be the World's Best Patient to Survive Managed Care.\\"  The Afterword isn't as funny as the rest of the book, at least to those of us who have survived treatment at an HMO.<br /><br />One of the author's suggestions could be helpful to anyone, physician or not, who wants to avoid long, pointless meetings.

I began this book shortly after the tsunami washed over shorelines across much of South Asia, and ghosts from that shifting plate boundary haunted my reading, as well as the ghosts that Pellegrino conjures up from Pompeii and Herculaneum.<br /><br />In the book \\"Rare Earth\\" (Copernicus, 2000), Dr. Peter D. Ward and Dr. Donald Brownlee of the University of Washington argued the slow recycling of planetary crust was essential for the evolution of complex life.  Dr. Charles Pellegrino makes the same proposition, even as he deals with the horrors caused by plate tectonics, most especially the eruption of Vesuvius in A.D. 79.<br /><br />\\"Ghosts of Vesuvius\\" is about large-scale human tragedies, including the eruption of Thera and its annihilation of Minoan civilization, the eruption of Vesuvius and the burial of Pompeii and Herculaneum, the sinking of the Titanic, and the collapse of the World Trade Center towers on 09/11/2001.<br /><br />If you're wondering what all of the above disasters have in common, the author (from his studies of the Titanic, Thera, and Vesuvius) has become \\"one of the world's only experts on downblast and surge physics.\\"  He was invited to Ground Zero to examine the effects of the towers' collapse, and he weaves his 21st century ghosts and physics into the grim warp of previous human obliterations. It is a riveting story.<br /><br />When he is not dealing with the big picture of cosmic beginnings, the origins of life, and plate tectonics, the author tells tales of human lives, brought back into existence through forensic archeology.  The fate of the veteran Roman soldier who died while trying to organize a seaward evacuation of Herculaneum, the heroic last moments of Chief Officer Murdoch aboard the sinking Titanic, and the stories of the firemen who continued up the stairwell in the North Tower even though they knew its collapse was imminent, are all well told---stories of ordinary people caught in the maw of extraordinary events.<br /><br />There are a few damp squibs in this book of amazing fireworks:<br /><br />* Benjamin Franklin visited the court of Louis XVI not Louis XIV<br /><br />* The fate of the Universe seems more likely to be a 'Big Chill' not a 'Big Crunch' as expounded in this book.  Even if there were a 'Big Crunch' I don't quite understand why Pellegrino believes the resulting 'Big Bang' would create exactly the same universe that we currently inhabit.<br /><br />* Even if Thera hadn't exploded and the Minoan civilization had continued to develop, I don't believe they were close to inventing space travel--not without calculus, much less without zero and the rest of the 'Arabic' numerals.<br /><br />Nevertheless, \\"Ghosts of Vesuvius\\" is a provocative, astonishing combination of many scientific disciplines, apocalyptic theology, great heroics, and ordinary lives cut brutally short.

Another very useful piece of equipment is a quilling cork board marked with circles where you can pin your petals, rolls, leaves, and hearts into (say) a Christmas wreath before gluing the individual pieces together.  An optional piece of equipment is a fringing tool ($50 at the quillingsuperstore.com).  You might also want a paper crimper.  Both of the latter items are needed for any fancy flower creations.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this Aussie author has not created very clear, easy-to-understand diagrams to work from.  Her drawings are filled with mysterious X's O's and spirals which are not shown to scale on a grid, which would have made them easier to copy.  There are some very cute projects in \\"Practical Quilling\\" including a jaunty frog, and some very beautiful flower cards, but I would recommend Malinda Johnston's \\"Paper Quilling\\" Weekend Crafter manual over this book for ease of use.	2005-01-14

Distinguished surgeon Sherwin B. Nuland estimates that only one in five deaths is peaceful, or at least quick.  The rest of us are doomed to prolonged suffering before we shuffle off of this mortal coil.  However, if we know what our end is going to be like, if the mystery of say, death by cancer is explained to us, we might at least lose our fear of the unknown.<br /><br />The first time I read this book, I didn't derive any comfort at all from knowing exactly how I might die.  But now that I've been through the shadow of cancer, I reread \\"How We Die\\" and it didn't frighten me any longer.  Dr. Nuland is right.  It is better to know, especially since you may need to decide whether you want to be kept alive for as long as possible, no matter what the price in pain, indignity, and loss of function.  The author serves as our Virgil, leading us down through the dread circles of terminal disease and accidental death in a graphic, unsentimental fashion.  The only time he loses his cool is during his description of young men and women dying of AIDS.  \\"What dignity or meaning can be snatched from such a death will never be known, except by those whose lives have embraced the life just lost.\\"<br /><br />The worst manner of death, no matter what the cause, seems to be at the hands of physicians who are willing to inflict the most drastic surgeries, chemotherapies, dialysis, and all manner of 21st century medical procedures on patients who have only a short time left to live, or who do not understand the risks and pain of the procedures that are being pressed upon them.  Dr. Nuland was guilty of this type of major medical intervention on two patients who were dying, one of them his own brother.  \\"I might have understood that my way of giving Harvey [his brother] the hope he asked for was not only a deception but, given what we knew about the toxicity of the experimental drugs, an almost certain source of added anguish for all of us.\\"<br /><br />The lessons that Dr. Nuland would like us to learn from \\"How We Die:\\"<br /><br />* Your doctors are likely to want to prolong your life, no matter what the cost.  It is up to you to decide whether the cost is worth the few weeks or months of prolonged life.  What will your quality of that life be?  For example, are you willing to accept a feeding tube, but not a ventilator?<br /><br />* Fill out that advanced directive to either prohibit or encourage major resuscitative efforts, in case you reach a point where you are no longer able to speak for yourself.  I had to answer this question for my mother on her last trip to the emergency room, because she had refused to think about what her end might be like.<br /><br />* \\"The greatest dignity to be found in death is the dignity of the life that preceded it.\\"  The end itself is likely to be undignified, painful, and a source of anguish to our loved ones.<br /><br />Dr. Nuland effectively dispels the myth of the dignified death, but he gives us realistic, compassionate advice on how to prepare for those final hours.way of giving Harvey [his brother] the hope he asked for was not only a deception but, given what we knew about the toxicity of the experimental drugs, an almost certain source of added anguish for all of us.\\" <br /> <br />The lessons that Dr. Nuland would like us to learn from \\"How We Die:\\" <br />* Your doctors are likely to want to prolong your life, no matter what the cost.

Who is it that howls at night down on the frozen river behind our house?  There are wolves in Michigan's Lower Peninsula now, but I heard wolves howling up in Canada's Northwest Territories, and these are not the howls of wolves.  When I lived and worked in the city, I heard just about every breed of dog there is yap, bark, bay, and yowl, but these creatures of the woods and frozen river are not dogs.<br /><br />Time to buy Catherine Reid's \\"Coyote:  Seeking the Hunter in our Midst\\" and find out whether coyotes have made their way this far East.  Surprise!  Coyotes are to be found in all of the lower 48 states and Michigan, according to this author, has reached its saturation point for these canid predators.  Humans are even allowed to hunt coyotes at night, which might explain the after-dark gunshots that I sometimes hear.<br /><br />\\"Coyote\\" is a fascinating collection of riffs or nature essays rather in the style of \\"Pilgrim at Tinker's Creek.\\"  Reid moves to an old farmhouse in Connecticut with her partner Holly, back to the land that she knew as a child, back to the bosom of her family.<br /><br />Will she and her partner be treated as outcasts--as human coyotes?  I think Reid might have been fearing a less-than-warm welcome, which is why she identifies so fiercely with the pariah canids.  However, her family welcomes the two women.  She writes about her brother, who lends a helping hand with repairs on the farmhouse.  There are warm riffs on family gatherings.  Reid takes her niece out into the woods and shows her the landmarks she remembered from her own childhood.  Although \\"Coyote\\" is primarily a book about wildlife and the land gone wild since it was farmed a century ago, it is also about family rhythms, as soothing as nursery songs to the ear.<br /><br />Catherine Reid is naturalist, teacher, editor, and poet.

Zelazny's \\"Lord of Light\\" is a story of a 'gods versus gods' war, and so is this book.  But in Gaiman's book, everyone is either a god, an unusually decent American, a serial killer disguised as a decent American, or a wife who returns from the dead.  The only gods who don't show up are Big J and his only begotten Son.  My favorite characters are the Egyptian deities who run a funeral home in Cairo---that's Illinois, not Egypt, even though one of them likes to snack off bits of organ meat from his customers.<br /><br />All the way through \\"American Gods\\" I kept asking myself, 'what could possibly be a happy ending for this book?'  All gods require believers and sacrifice in order to exist.  The gods we imported to America with us are hungry, cranky, and old.  The new gods (one is thinly disguised as Bill Gates) are afraid that their life-spans are going to be very short.  Who still believes in the railroad god?<br /><br />Gods die, the very old ones who lose all of their followers.  Why does Gaiman include their stories?  Well, it certainly lends to the dark atmospherics of his book.  I think he also wanted to show how these gods and their worshippers came to this land:  some as traders; some in chains; some as warriors and hunters.  Here, he says, here is how we ended up elbow-to-elbow with Odin and Ibis-headed gods, gods of the internet, and gods of the land.  No wonder Armageddon is inevitable.<br /><br />Or is it?  Can an ex-con named Shadow, his dead wife, and some of his very odd friends stave off the final confrontation?  Follow Gaiman to an eerie motel in the navel of America and celebrate (or mourn) the twilight of at least one god.  Follow him to San Francisco and witness the violent demise of the Queen of Sheba.  With this book, Gaiman has turned himself into the William Least Heat Moon of America's fantasy highways.	2005-01-06

John Innes Mackintosh Stewart wrote the introduction to \\"Dead and Dumb,\\" wherein he claims that Crispin solved the dilemma  of the `Great Detective versus the bumbling police' scenario that many Golden Age mystery authors had to contend with.  The dilemma in a nutshell: why would a twentieth-century policeman, who was much more adept and scientifically trained than his counterpart in the late Victorian era of Sherlock and Mycroft, call in an amateur (no matter how intelligent) to help him with his inquiries?<br /><br />According to Innes, \\"The Great Detective was, curiously, often a person of title, like Dorothy Sayers's Lord Peter Wimsey, or at least the familiar of persons of title.  It is never easy to render plausible the acceptance of a meddlesome private investigator by a group of professional policemen standing round a corpse, and novelists appear to have felt that a lord will be better received...\\"<br /><br />Innes himself wrote a series of mysteries starring the titled Sir John Appleby.<br /><br />Crispin avoided the `blue-blooded detective' solution.  His detective, Gervase Fen is part of the same social milieu as the police.  He is a professor of English literature at Oxford, but his cherished hobby is criminal investigation.  His detective counterpart (Sir Richard Freeman in \\"Dead and Dumb\\") has a passion for literary scholarship. Their dialogues (mainly disagreements) keep \\"Dead and Dumb\\" swimming right along.  It's definitely not a `Great Detective versus bumbling policeman' relationship---it's more like two crotchety friends with mutual interests who keep running into each other in various Oxford pubs and murder scenes.<br /><br />\\"Dead and Dumb\\" starts out rather unpromisingly:<br /><br />\\"There are few creatures more stupid than the average singer.  It would appear that the fractional adjustment of larynx, glottis and sinuses required in the production of beautiful sounds must almost invariably be accompanied---so perverse are the habits of Providence---by the witlessness of a barnyard fowl.\\"<br /><br />I would have thought that the above statement applied to tenors and sopranos only (singing in such a high register seems to destroy their brain cells), but it is the bass in \\"Dead and Dumb\\" who sets himself up for murder.  Several members of  \\"Die Meistersinger von N&uuml;rnberg\\" cast have good reasons for wishing Edwin Shorthouse dead, in spite of his voice and its drawing power.<br /><br />Even his composer-brother has a motive for killing the bass, and after a meeting with him, Fen is also made to question the intelligence of composers:  \\"As a general rule, composers aren't the brightest of mortals, except where music's concerned.\\"<br /><br />Since Crispin himself composed music, it might be better if the reader did not take his commentary on the intelligence of musicians too seriously!<br /><br />One of my favorite characters from \\"The Moving Toyshop\\" shows up in \\"Dead and Dumb\\"-the deaf and (according to Fen) senile Professor Wilkes who makes a habit of stealing Fen's whisky.  He and Fen are always good for a round or two of acrimonious repartee whenever they meet.<br /><br />A third dialogue element that threads merrily through the book is a crime writer's attempt to interview Fen about his most famous cases.  Every time Fen clears his throat and begins, \\"The era of my greatest successes...\\" someone is bound to interrupt him.<br /><br />We never do get to learn what Fen considers his greatest successes, but surely the outcome of \\"Dead and Dumb\\" must be counted among them.bly be accompanied---so perverse are the habits of Providence---by the witlessness of a barnyard fowl.\\" <br /> <br />I would have thought that the above statement applied to tenors and sopranos only (singing in such a high register seems to destroy their brain cells), but it is the bass in \\"Dead and Dumb\\" who sets himself up for murder.

A son attempts to kill his father, and there is no mystery about what happened.  Fen's challenge is to prove that an attempt at murder occurred in the face of the father's denial:<br /><br />\\"A word like `evil' needs (he will tell you) to be used with precaution: the descent of Avernus has no milestones which mark out for the traveller---or for others watching him---the stages of his journey.

It involves foul play at the Castrevenford School for Boys, the second of Crispin's mysteries to take place outside of Fen's usual haunts in Oxford.<br /><br />From 1943 to 1945 the author, Bruce Montgomery a.k.a. Edmund Crispin worked as an assistant master at Schrewsbury School, and he attributes his \\"knowledge of the criminal in human nature\\" to this experience.  I'm certain the fictional Castrevenford School and its inhabitants bear a close resemblance to Schrewsbury School and its inhabitants.  In fact, my Penguin edition of \\"Love Lies Bleeding\\" does not include the usual disclaimer  about `work of fiction whose characters bear no resemblance, etc. etc...'<br /><br />Hopefully, there weren't quite as many homicides at Schrewsbury.<br /><br />One of my favorite characters in the Fen mysteries, the ancient and possibly senile Professor Wilkes, is missing from \\"Love Lies Bleeding.\\"  However at Castrevenford, Professor Wilkes has an eerie alter-ego in the ancient and possibly senile mixed Bloodhound, Mr. Merrythought.  In fact, the dog almost steals the stage from Fen:<br /><br />\\"'Good God,' said Fen in a muffled voice.<br /><br />\\"The dog was a large, forbidding bloodhound, on whose aboriginal color and shape one or two other breeds had been more or less successfully superimposed.  He stood just inside the doorway, unnervingly immobile, and fixed Fen with a malevolent and hypnotic stare....<br /><br />\\"'He ought to be put away, really,' said the headmaster, regarding Mr. Merrythought with considerable distaste.  `The trouble is, you see, that he's liable to homicidal fits.'<br /><br />\\"'Oh,' said Fen. `Oh.'\\"<br /><br />Mr. Merrythought turns out to be a hero, not a murderer although there are plenty of those to go around.  Fen is invited to Castrevenford by his old friend the Headmaster, as a last-minute substitute to give out the prizes on Speech Day.  By the time Fen arrives, a student from the nearby Castrevenford Girls' High School has gone missing.  By the end of the day, two of the teachers at Castrevenford School for Boys are dead.<br /><br />\\"Love Lies Bleeding\\" is less farcical than many of the Fen mysteries.  The school setting and its characters are marvelously depicted, without the exaggeration that Crispin sometimes used in his other books.  If it weren't for the murders, \\"Love Lies Bleeding\\" could be classified as a minor gem of an English pastoral.  It's my favorite Fen.<br /><br />Of course, no Fen mystery is complete without a thicket of literary allusions.  If you are familiar with Wordsworth's poem, \\"Love lies bleeding,\\" then you may be able to guess the fate of the missing schoolgirl:<br /><br />\\"You call it, \\"Love lies bleeding,\\"--so you may,/  Though the red Flower, not prostrate, only droops,/  As we have seen it here from day to day,/  From month to month, life passing not away:/  A flower how rich in sadness!...\\"  (William Wordsworth)ubstitute to give out the prizes on Speech Day.

One of the stories about the god, Dagon who somehow ended up in a Cornish bog was so amateurishly written, I chortled throughout.  Chortling was probably not the effect the author was striving for, but \\"The voices laughed, chuckling insanely at his plight:  voices which he knew instinctively were not human.\\"  We never do find out who is chuckling insanely.  I guess it is just one of those froggy sound effects one finds in Cornish bogs.<br /><br />The really wonderful stories of '65 Great Tales' are already in print in several anthologies, most notably \\"The Oxford Book of English Ghost Stories,\\" the twenty Fontana books of 'Great Ghost Stories,' and the classic \\"Great Tales of Horror and the Supernatural.\\"  These eerie tales are always worth reading again, and they include \\"The Monkey's Paw\\" (W. W. Jacobs), \\"Lost Hearts\\" (M. R. James), \\"An Account of Some Strange Disturbances in Aungier Street\\" (J. Sheridan Le Fanu), \\"The Upper Berth\\" (F. Marion Crawford) and \\"The Phantom Coach\\" (Amelia B. Edwards).  Probably half the stories in this book fall into the oft-printed, oft-read category.<br /><br />However, there were a few stories I'd never seen before that are definitely worth savoring.  Among them:<br /><br />\\"Carnival on the Downs\\" by Gerald Kersh--A man sees an advertisement for \\"!!! Jolly Jumbo's Carnival !!!\\" in the local pub and tracks down two of the performers, who are in desperate straits in an old, abandoned barn.  He goes to fetch the doctor and becomes the unwitting catalyst of an old curse.<br /><br />\\"South Sea Bubble\\" by Hammond Innes--\\"She lay in Kinlochbervie in the north-west of Scotland, so cheap I should have known there was something wrong.\\"  A man buys the ship of his dreams and discovers that there is indeed something wrong with her, and it's not just her leaky hull.<br /><br />\\"The Mark of the Beast\\" by Rudyard Kipling--I can see why this particular tale of Kipling's India might not have appealed to other editors.  There is one scene where two British soldiers torture an old leper.  However gruesome, it's an absorbing tale of friendship, and a warning not to insult the local deities.<br /><br />\\"All Souls\\" by Edith Wharton--A woman is incapacitated with a broken ankle in her old Connecticut farmhouse and for some reason finds herself deserted by all of her servants.he Beast\\" by Rudyard Kipling--I can see why this particular tale of Kipling's India might not have appealed to other editors.

Then there is another strange little boy who has an invisible companion named Beelzy.  If you think you know who Beelzy is, you are probably right.  None of these stories are particularly well-known, except for an excerpt from Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" entitled \\"Dracula's Guest.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Lamp\\" by Agatha Christie--A little boy is the only one who can set free the soul of another child who starved to death in his mother's new house.<br /><br />\\"Nerves\\" by Guy de Maupassant--Atmospheric tale of a man with an unusual tic, and his daughter who always wears a glove on her left hand.<br /><br />\\"Thus I Refute Beelzy\\" by John Collier--This is absolutely one of the best stories in the ghostly subgenre of 'child with an invisible companion.'  It is an economically told tale of a sadistic dentist 'Big Simon' and his son 'Little Simon' who happens to have an invisible companion named 'Beelzy.'<br /><br />\\"Keeping His Promise\\" by Algernon Blackwood--One of my favorite stories by this well-known author.  A medical student is visited by one of his former friends, who appears to be starving.<br /><br />\\"The House\\" by Andr&eacute; Maurois--A woman finds her dream house, and discovers that she appears to be responsible for vacating the former tenants.<br /><br />\\"The Call of the Hand\\" by Louis Golding--A wildly romantic tale of two brothers who are joined at the wrist from birth, and who both fall in love with the same woman.  As is usual in tales like this, it is the poor bride who suffers the most.<br /><br />\\"The Dream Woman\\" by W. Wilkie Collins--A man saves a woman who is about to commit suicide, then marries her.  He doesn't immediately recognize her as the woman who came to him in a nightmare and tried to stab him, but his mother does.<br /><br />\\"The Story of the Late Mr. Elvesham\\" by H. G.

They tried to enter the minds of the beasts themselves, either through interviews or by examining the written output of the killers.<br /><br />Some of the authors developed a disturbing empathy with their subjects, most especially David Berkowitz, who was truly beset by demons, and Dennis Nilsen, the necrophile who was Great Britain's most prolific serial killer until Dr. Harold Shipman bumped him out of the number one spot.  It was an uncomfortable reading experience, which is an indication of how well these profiles were written.  The only serial killer with a multi-page profile who elicited no sympathy at all was Ted Bundy.  Perhaps it was because he was the only one in this book who led a relatively normal childhood, or perhaps it was because he was gifted with intelligence and good looks--he seemed to have everything he needed to succeed at a legitimate profession, and yet he was a monster; he 'chose' to be a monster--or at least that's how I interpreted his story.<br /><br />This book also features a 'Gallery of Evil' portraying other serial killers such as the 'Night Stalker' and 'The Fiend of Whitechapel' in less depth than the major subjects. A standard feature of this Time-Life true crime series are the brooding black-and-white photographs and this book does not disappoint.  The only color photo is a two-page fold of John Wayne Gacy in his clown costume.  Ugh.  I wonder if this photo inspired Stephen King's novel, \\"It.\\"<br /><br />This book was published in 1992, and the whole series provides a disturbing but fascinating read for true crime buffs.	2004-12-27

Or is it?	\\"Ship of Destiny\\" was supposed to be the final book of Robin Hobb's \\"Liveship Traders\\" trilogy, but it leaves many loose ends, including the nature and fate of the bead-maker, Amber.  And what about those slug-ugly creatures who imprisoned She Who Remembers?  Who were they and what is their fate?<br /><br />There are references to 'Bingtown dragons' in the first book of Hobb's 'Tawny Man' series, so perhaps that is where the author is going to blend in a few 'Liveship Traders' odds and ends.<br /><br />In \\"Ship of Destiny,\\" Althea Vestrit continues her quest to recover her liveship Vivacia until the bitter-sweet end of the trilogy.  But Vivacia is no longer the girlishly innocent ship that bonded with Althea back in \\"Ship of Magic.\\"  The carrion-hunting sea serpents are no longer mindless slaves to their appetites.  Bingtown is burning and the Old Traders are in disarray. The pirates appear to be sweeping all before them.  The plot moves on, not always rewarding the just and punishing the evil.<br /><br />It's funny how the pirates turned out to be the good guys in this trilogy. I was really sad when my favorite character died, no matter that he was seriously flawed.  The parts where I zoned out involved the sea serpents.  Even after She Who Remembers showed up, they were kind of one-note-Johnnies.<br /><br />In spite of a few slow spots, 'Liveship Traders' is a great fantasy trilogy.  Hobb's dragon life-cycle I think is unique in all of the literature--and it makes glorious sense.  Just think of dragon flies.<br /><br />I'm hoping we hear more of Malta and the mutant Rain Wild River Traders in further books by Robin Hobb, even though the 'Liveship Traders' trilogy is complete.	2004-12-23

This is one of those books where you just want to bang a couple of characters upside the head and shout, \\"Will you two just hop into the sack and get it over with!\\"  Other than a certain frustration with the romantic pace, \\"Mad Ship\\" is hypnotic reading.  Even for someone who has to wear an anti-nausea patch on her neck on a slow old tub of a ferry and who would certainly not care for weevils in her biscuits, author Robin Hobb makes me want to sing: \\"Whate'er the final harbor be /'T is good to sail upon the sea!\\"<br /><br />There are no final harbors in \\"Mad Ship\\" as it is the second book in the trilogy \\"Liveship Traders.\\"  All of the characters who survived \\"Ship of Magic\\" are further developed, even (or most especially) the sea serpents who finally sort out who they are, but not where they're going---they don't actually figure that out until Book III.  As I said, there are no final harbors in the middle book, just lots of pain and suffering and personal development.  The main character from Book I, Althea Vestrit develops the least, merely bangs about on the high seas in an attempt to return to her liveship, Vivacia with whom she had mystically bonded.  Vivacia herself falls in love with the pirate king ('it is it is a wonderful thing...') Kennit who has captured her.  The pirate is also holding Althea's nephew, Wintrow (the somewhat wimpy would-be priest) hostage, along with Wintrow's hateful father (who doesn't develop at all, just remains despicable through all three books).<br /><br />Althea's niece Malta, who was an absolute bitch (she could have played one of the Plastics in \\"Mean Girls\\") in Book I grows remarkably interesting in \\"Mad Ship,\\" mainly through losing her father, her family's fortune, and (almost) her life.  She has to flee Bingtown and live with the mutant Rain Wild River Traders in their tree houses and sunken Elder city. Here there be dragons and other fascinating creatures, and Malta and her brother Selden survive quakes, cave-ins, hallucinations, a whiny Satrap, and (in Malta's case) true love.<br /><br />Paragon, the mad ship of the title unwillingly sails again, still uttering an occasional threat to murder his crew--not idle talk on his part as he did kill his first two crews.  He tangles with the sea serpents, and with all of us readers who finally begin to realize what live ships really are.

I recently reread it and realized I'd forgotten how talky the badger and the elves were.  I still think it's a good fantasy, but with a complicated theology that the author needs lots of print to explain.<br /><br />The background is pseudo-medieval, beloved of many fantasy authors although usually not of de Lint who evolved away from sturdy peasants, trebuchets, and trade fairs into urban fantasy settings.  \\"The Riddle of the Wren\\" is one of his earliest publications.  Like another great Canadian author, Farley Mowat, the call of the wild rings through de Lint's novels, including this one.  If his character has horns on its head or assumes the shape of a northern mammal, you can be pretty sure it is on the side of the good.<br /><br />The 'wren' of this story is innkeeper's daughter, Minda Sealy who must flee from world to world through magical megalithic gates resembling Stonehenge.  She is pursued by the evil Dream-master, Ildran although we don't know why until nearly the end of the book.  During her travels, she gains many allies both human and fae, were and hobogle.  There are also Lore-mistresses, erlkin, harpers, and Wyslings such as the badger, Grimbold.  There were at one time Dark gods and Gray gods, although hardly anyone wants to hasten their return to Mid-wold.<br /><br />I never did quite figure out the difference between Walkers and Wasters, although they were both extremely bad dudes.<br /><br />A trickle of Celtic harp weaves in and out of the Wren's story, along with encounters with horned lords and (possibly) the Great God Pan.  Even as she acquires powerful, magical friends Minda realizes that she alone can confront and destroy the evil Dream-Master.  I think you'll want to follow her story to its end, in spite of the over-rich tapestry of characters (beware of fantasies with glossaries).	2004-12-15

There are five narrators in all, each with his own distinctive voice.  There are also several solutions to the murder, and Innes makes each solution seem like the correct one when presented by one of the narrators.  I think this is his most rigorous and plausible mystery---well, except for the intrusion of the messenger rats---this author cannot resist a slight touch of the surreal.<br /><br />The Laird of Erchany, Ranald Guthrie has two outstanding traits:  his miserliness, which is causing his castle to fall down around his ears; and his fear of death:  he chants &#34;Lament for a Maker&#34; through his rat-infested halls, and the villagers of Kinkeig quite rightly think him mad. He is served by the Hardcastles, a seedy old couple, and Tammas, a brain-damaged boy.  Even as Ranald Guthrie might remind you of an evil Prospero, and his niece Christine of Miranda, Tammas will make you think of Caliban.<br /><br />Two guests are stranded at Erchany on Christmas Eve by a snow storm, and one of them just happens to be the Laird of Erchany's American heir.  When Tammas struggles through the snow drifts and into the village of Kinkeig on Christmas morning, the early kirk-goers are interrupted by cries of murder most foul.<br /><br />Inspector Appleby, a solicitor, a cobbler, a physician, and the Laird of Erchany's unwanted guests must work together to prevent more lives from being destroyed by a plot that seethes in fratricide, incest, and a centuries-old clan feud.at seethes in fratricide, incest, and a centuries-old clan feud.	2004-12-13

Among the seats of learning where he taught are Queen's University in Belfast, and the universities of Oxford, Adelaide, and Leeds.<br /><br />The author could not help but involve a legion of eccentric, pompous, and even murderous professors in his narrative and their quarrels (the matter of the shared telephone), naps (a fatal pastime for Professor Pluckrose), and hobbies (Pluckrose appeared to have been smashed by his 'own' meteorite, which was a sort of poetic justice since he had originally stolen it from the Duke of Nesfield) are a good part of what makes this book sparkle.  Since this mystery takes place in one of England's provincial universities, Innes also cocks an occasional snoot at its parvenu ways:  \\"The staff--a word which at Oxford or Cambridge might be used of persons employed in a hotel--is not accommodated in spacious common rooms or cozy suites.\\"<br /><br />After Professor Pluckrose is found under his meteorite in his usual napping spot in the courtyard of Nesfield University, Inspector Appleby and his provincial comrade-in-arms, Hobhouse set out to examine the clues of the numerous false beards, the green bust, the false passports and the  polygamous student, the darkroom maze, the meteorite, and of course, the murder.  And by the way, who turned on the courtyard fountain just as the Dean was passing by?<br /><br />All of these elements must come together before book's end when Appleby reveals the solution to this complicated puzzle.<br /><br />If you haven't already discovered Michael Innes, \\"The Weight of the Evidence\\" is a good place to start among his donnish Appleby mysteries, although my personal favorite is \\"Death at the President's Lodging\\" (1936) if only because its setting bears a close resemblance to Oxford University.r /> <br />	2004-12-13

In fact if a mysterious prankster called the Spider is substituted for Rineheart's Bat---well, Innes adds unique touches of his own to a weekend in the British countryside gone awry.<br /><br />Popular author, Richard Eliot, has written numerous detective novels, featuring 'The Spider', a daring, clever criminal in earlier books, and an equally clever private investigator in later ones. But when the Spider comes to life--first to burgle an eccentric neighbor, then to harass the author's family, and finally to attend his own birthday party-- Inspector John Appleby is called up from London by his sister (I believe this is only one of two Appleby novels in which she appears--see also &#34;The Paper Thunderbolt&#34;) to discover the fictional creature's mundane identity.<br /><br />Inspector Appleby makes a dramatic entry into Rust Hall during a mysteriously contrived black-out and begins to sort out a very large cast of characters, including a psychiatrist, a growling ghost writer, feuding Oxford professors, Eliot's publisher, an actor, a ne'er-do-well brother, a herd of pigs, an art-collecting arms-dealer--well, the list goes on and on.  I had to read &#34;The Spider Strikes&#34; twice in order to fix its dramatis personae firmly in mind.  It's not the best Appleby novel but it is certainly the most complex.<br /><br />The mystery itself is cluttered with subplots, and the solution is rather contrived.  Read &#34;The Spider Strikes&#34; for its slowly building atmosphere of terror.  Rust Hall and later, Shoon Abbey are lovingly detailed architectural monstrosities that serve as the brooding lairs of The Spider.  One might even categorize this novel as 'Early Appleby Gothic.'	2004-12-13

If nothing else, the editors of the Time-Life crime books are less apt to overuse clich&eacute;s and wimpy adjectives.  The writing is crisp and factual. A standard feature of any Time-Life book is the photographs, and the crime series holds to this tradition.<br /><br />Criminologists categorize people who kill several victims in a single short and bloody episode as 'mass murderers.'  This particular book has seven chapters, featuring the following mass murderers:<br /><br />* \\"Loser\\"--Richard Speck--\\"Yeah, I killed them.  I stabbed them and I choked them.\\"  Eight young nurses were murdered by Speck, and that might not have been his only mass murder.  Police also suspected him of the 1966 deaths of three young women in the Indiana Dunes National Lakefront Park, whose bodies were never found.<br /><br />* \\"The Tower\\"--Charles Whitman--\\"At times it seems as if I am going to explode.\\"--Whitman killed his wife and mother before climbing to the top of the University of Texas clock tower and killing 16 other innocent victims.<br /><br />* \\"Days of Rage\\"--Snapshots of fourteen murderers who killed a total of 123 people.<br /><br />* \\"Mata\\"--Mark Essex--\\"My destiny lies in the bloody death of racist pigs.\\"  9 people were killed and 12 people were seriously wounded, mainly in the New Orleans Howard Johnson hotel where Essex made his stand.<br /><br />* \\"The Tally\\"--James Huberty--\\"I believe in paying my debts, both good and bad.\\"  Huberty was responsible for the massacre of 21 people at the San Ysidro McDonald's restaurant.<br /><br />* \\"Small Game\\"--Marc L&eacute;pine--\\"Feminists have always had a talent for enraging me.\\"--14 women died; 15 men and women were injured, some seriously.  Lepine was Canada's worst mass murderer.<br /><br />* \\"War Game\\"--Michael Ryan--\\"I wish I had stayed in bed.\\" --15 victims, including his mother in Hungerford, England.<br /><br />Most of the killers featured in \\"Mass Murderers\\" died from police fire or self-inflicted gunshot wounds.  One of the most chilling features of this book is the amount of documentation that the killers left behind to justify their massacres.other in Hungerford, England. <br /> <br />Most of the killers featured in \\"Mass Murderers\\" died from police fire or self-inflicted gunshot wounds.

He can commit suicide quickly or commit suicide slowly.  Jeremy Bremen tries both ways.<br /><br />I didn't even try to follow the equations in this book.  I had my fill of diffie q's when I was in college. You might be interested in figuring out whether the author is merely waving his hands over the math and science, or whether he is truly attempting to make a case for the creation of new universes every time we commit to an action--whether it is something as simple as sitting down or remaining on our feet.  Somewhere in the swiftly branching universes, Jeremy Bremen's wife didn't get brain cancer and die.  Another, much older scientist who may be the only one who understands Jeremy's equations, gets the notion that he can find a universe that didn't experience the Holocaust of WWII, and where his family didn't die in the Ravensbruck concentration camp.<br /><br />He kills himself.<br /><br />\\"The Hollow Man\\" splits its chapters between Jeremy's hellish adventures after his wife dies, and flashbacks to happier days when she was alive and he was solving the mysteries of the universe.  The poignancy is almost too difficult to bear, but Simmons is a good author and he makes you want to follow Jeremy to his quietus.  Another character, a boy who was born blind, deaf, and mute and who is viciously abused by his mother and her live-in boyfriends, also narrates parts of the story.  How Jeremy's universe and the universe of the handicapped boy overlap is the highlight and climax of \\"The Hollow Man.\\"nt to follow Jeremy to his quietus.

For instance, in the title story, \\"A Rose for her Grave\\" in Crime File 1, an American Bluebeard discards his innocent, loving, beautiful wives on hikes or raft trips.  Only one of them is smart enough to divorce him after an outing on the Skykomish River, punctuated (or 'punctured' one might say) by her new husband's attempts to paddle their raft over sharp boulders.<br /><br />Usually the women in Ann Rule's stories are murdered before or because they try to flee an abusive relationship, but in \\"A Rose for her Grave\\" at least wife #3 is smart enough and lucky enough to survive Randy Roth, who goes on to drown wife #4.<br /><br />The other stories in 'Crime Files 1' are shorts, which I think is actually the author's fort&eacute; as they are not as repetitious as her novel-length cases.  True-crime aficionados will appreciate Ann Rule's meticulous attention to detail, and her extensive contacts with law enforcement officials which brought these stories into print.<br /><br />\\"Campbell's Revenge\\"--An indictment of the Washington state prison bureaucracy that allowed a rapist to be entered into a work release program only a few miles from a victim who testified against him.

Forensics plays a vital role in solving this crime.  This rape/murder took place in the early eighties and it makes you want to fast-forward a decade to the acceptance and use of industrial-strength DNA testing<br /><br />The title story, \\"You Belong to Me\\" starts out Crime File 2.  In this 192-page thriller, a wife divorces her psycho policeman-husband.  She lives in fear of him, is stalked by him, has her home invaded by him, has her phone tapped by him.  Then he is finally arrested--not for stalking his ex-wife--but for the murder of a woman he had stopped for a traffic violation.<br /><br />I'd guess the moral of this story is that stalkers should be taken more seriously by law enforcement, even (or especially) if they happen to be policemen.<br /><br />The other five cases in this crime file are told in brief, punchy detail.<br /><br />\\"Black Christmas\\"--A loner commie-hater kills the wrong family, believing they're Communist (wrong) Jews (wrong).  The manner of death is particularly macabre.  This is going to be the worst Christmas story you've ever read.<br /><br />\\"One Trick Pony\\"--A beautiful cowgirl doesn't get her tee shirt in time, and is murdered by her alcoholic husband.  He almost gets away with it, but continues to have bad luck with the women in his life.  One of his girlfriends is shot in the stomach and her death is ruled a suicide even though \\"when the police got there they found Russ standing next to the dead woman, the gun in his hand.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Computer Error and the Killer\\"--The author included this case because she thinks that \\"it demonstrates how charming and benign the sadistic sociopath can be when he wants to appear that way.\\"  A monster slips through the cogs of the criminal justice system and kills again and again.<br /><br />\\"The Vanishing\\"--A teenager who is about to go on vacation to Hawaii vanishes under strange circumstances.

This book must have been written for the fans of RAH's so-called juvenile science fiction, of which I am one.  Old and decrepit though I may be, I can still quote whole paragraphs of \\"Have Spacesuit Will Travel\\" from memory.<br /><br />As with all tributes, \\"The Free Lunch\\" falls a bit flat if you are expecting something signed, sealed, and proofread by the Master.  This is an imitation of Heinlein from one of his talkier novels, with computers instead of slide rules, and the author never did quite convince me that I would want to actually live in his Dreamworld theme park.<br /><br />So TANSTAAFL (\\"there ain't no such thing as a free lunch\\") as the Master once said.  Get over it.  Mike and Annie make \\"The Free Lunch\\" worth reading.  Annie is a sort of human midget Mother Thing, only a bit rougher around the personality.  Mike is a male Pee Wee (\\"I'd rather dance with the kitchen stool\\"), young and sort of sexless (except for an involuntary boner when he wakes up in Annie's hide-out under Dreamworld), and very, very smart.  He and Annie, aka the Mother Elf band together to outwit the owner of a rival theme park, who wants to destroy Dreamworld.  While keeping an eye on the bad guy's thugs and hiding from Dreamworld's employees, Annie notices that more trolls are leaving the park at quittin' time than showed up for work in the morning.<br /><br />Are the extra trolls employed by the master thug?  Are they aliens from outer space who have found a great place to beam down?  What?<br /><br />If you're tired of gore-and-guts Alien-Dreamcatcher-Matrix ripoffs, this book is a trip back to 1960s SF (with holographs and the occasional boner).	2004-11-27

Distinguished surgeon Sherwin B. Nuland estimates that only one in five deaths is peaceful, or at least quick.  The rest of us are doomed to prolonged suffering before we shuffle off of this mortal coil.  However, if we know what our end is going to be like, if the mystery of say, death by cancer is explained to us, we might at least lose our fear of the unknown.<br /><br />The first time I read this book, I didn't derive any comfort at all from knowing exactly how I might die.  But now that I've been through the shadow of cancer, I reread \\"How We Die\\" and it didn't frighten me any longer.  Dr. Nuland is right.  It is better to know, especially since you may need to decide whether you want to be kept alive for as long as possible, no matter what the price in pain, indignity, and loss of function.  The author serves as our Virgil, leading us down through the dread circles of terminal disease and accidental death in a graphic, unsentimental fashion.  The only time he loses his cool is during his description of young men and women dying of AIDS.  \\"What dignity or meaning can be snatched from such a death will never be known, except by those whose lives have embraced the life just lost.\\"<br /><br />The worst manner of death, no matter what the cause, seems to be at the hands of physicians who are willing to inflict the most drastic surgeries, chemotherapies, dialysis, and all manner of 21st century medical procedures on patients who have only a short time left to live, or who do not understand the risks and pain of the procedures that are being pressed upon them.  Dr. Nuland was guilty of this type of major medical intervention on two patients who were dying, one of them his own brother.  \\"I might have understood that my way of giving Harvey [his brother] the hope he asked for was not only a deception but, given what we knew about the toxicity of the experimental drugs, an almost certain source of added anguish for all of us.\\"<br /><br />The lessons that Dr. Nuland would like us to learn from \\"How We Die:\\"<br /><br />* Your doctors are likely to want to prolong your life, no matter what the cost.

By the end of \\"The Magicians' Guild,\\" the bad guy is revealed, order is restored to the magical community, and the heroine and her friend from the Thieves' Guild appear to at least have a chance of living happily ever after.  There are a few loose ends, but this book is the first of the 'Black Magician' trilogy, so a teaser is to be expected.<br /><br />If this is your first fantasy, \\"The Magician's Guild\\" is a fairly decent read.  If it's your hundredth, then you'll recognize the plot, background, and characters:  poor, but courageous heroine is cursed with a magical talent that is getting stronger by the day, and is not under her control.  The only people who can save her belong to the hated Magician's Guild and she would rather die than deal with those meatballs.  Her friends in the Thieves' Guild hide her as long as they can, but eventually her uncontrollable magic is exploding walls and setting whole blocks of slum on fire.  The heroine finally gets with the program in the Magicians' Guild, and much to her surprise discovers that some of the practitioners are actually pretty decent folks.<br /><br />Most of the story is taken up by the heroine's struggle to keep hating the magicians, in spite of the fact that the reader can spot from a million miles off that she's going to become one of them.<br /><br />Cozies tend not to have much in the way of suspense, complex characters, or imaginative settings, but if they are your cup of tea, then \\"The Magicians' Guild\\" is recommended reading.	2004-11-18

'Breezy' might seem like an odd descriptor for a book about murder, but that's the tone this author achieves, while whole families are battered to death with a sash weight, actresses are pushed out of portholes at sea, and a woman is shampooed to death by her boyfriend.<br /><br />Both the notorious and the obscure make their appearance in a particular year, and sometimes more than one year.  In retrospect, it's amazing how many murderers were set free to kill again.<br /><br />The author has a soft spot in his heart for some of his murderers, including the poisoner, Dr. Crippen.  The good doctor's wife is described as a second-rate soprano. She is \\"a vulgar, domineering, promiscuous woman.\\" On the other hand, her killer a is 'meek and mild-mannered' man who \\"has won the affection and, to some extent, admiration of his jailers.\\"<br /><br />Although occasional misogynist rants darken the overall cheerful tone of the articles, this author really comes into his own when writing about oddball sexual scandals.  He gives us headlines like \\"Gay slave boy batters top people's S-M gal pal,\\" \\"Miss Whiplash Found, Bound and Drowned in Bath,\\" and \\"Jet Set Rent Boy was Rough Trade Killer.\\"  One of his favorite scandals was eventually made into a movie called \\"The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing\\" starring the inimitable Joan Collins.  Even if you don't read the whole book, be sure to turn to 1906 and check out \\"Society Sex Scandals behind New York Killing.\\"  It features beautiful chorus girl Evelyn Nesbit (the girl on the red velvet swing) and dog-whip-wielding millionaire Harry K.

Not only was it turned into a 1955 movie and several books, it eventually ended up as a morality tale in the February 1999 'Smithsonian' Magazine.<br /><br />Henry K.

It is also normal for them to stick to a single poison.  But John Dickson Carr really lets loose in this mystery and gives us a dysfunctional family's gourmet guide to poisons--three of them:  arsenic; morphine; and hydrobromide of hyoscin (the infamous Dr. Crippen used hyoscin to dispose of his wife in 1910).<br /><br />In the 1930s, arsenic could be purchased in any pharmacy as a rat poison, but for the latter two poisons to be lying around the mansion, it helps to have a doctor marry in to the family. Sadly enough, the doctor who marries into this family is the third victim to be poisoned and the first to die.<br /><br />A creeping marble hand that has been broken off of a statue of the Emperor Caligula also serves to heighten tensions, especially after people see it scurrying along window ledges like a big white spider.<br /><br />Jeff Marle, who shows up in many of Carr's Bencolin mysteries as the Parisian juge d'instruction's clueless sidekick, is back in his native Pennsylvania for \\"Poison in Jest.\\"  He is invited over to chez Quayle to critique a manuscript, and almost from the moment he walks through the door, people begin to keel over, including his host.  He stays on to help find the poisoner, assisted by the eccentric fianc&eacute; of Jinny Quayle.  This fianc&eacute; is another Dr. Gideon Fell in very slight disguise, e.g. he isn't fat and he doesn't stomp around with crutch-canes.  However, he does pop up in the oddest corners, muttering mystical clues that don't really shed any light on the murderer's identity.<br /><br />Luckily this Dr. Fell clone dies a-borning--I believe this is the only book where he appears, thank god.  It wouldn't do to have two of them clumping and mumbling through Carr's mysteries.<br /><br />Read \\"Poison in Jest\\" for its brooding Gothic atmosphere--the marble emperor's detached hand; lights that won't stay on; staircases creaking in the night.

I've read many medical autobiographies by physicians such as Frank T. Vertosick, Michael Baden, Robert S. Desowitz, and William A. Nolen, but none that have terrified me as much as \\"A Not Entirely Benign Procedure.\\"<br /><br />Perri Klass received her MD from Harvard in 1986, and is an Associate Professor of Pediatrics at Boston University School of Medicine and Boston Medical Center, where her subspecialty is Pediatric Infectious Diseases.  She is also an extensively published writer.<br /><br />\\"A Not Entirely Benign Procedure\\" was written deep within the bowels of medical school by a new initiate into the arcane, bloody, sometimes agonizing rituals of late 20th-century medicine.  Perri Klass had a bit more to deal with than the average medical student, when she learned she was pregnant on the afternoon of her first anatomy exam.  The author was the first to admit she was no superwoman:  \\"I was a totally frazzled, frequently irritable, chronically sleep-deprived case, depending for my survival on the support and patience of others...\\"<br /><br />One of her fantasies was to crawl into one of the hospital beds, slip an IV into her arm, and be taken care of like a patient.  Sleep.  Wake up to take a sleeping pill.  Sleep.<br /><br />If nothing else this book talked me out of the deep-seated fantasy that I should have gone to medical school---not with an absolute need for eight hours of sleep every night.  I'll stick to watching \\"Trauma--Life in the ER\\" and reading books like this one.<br /><br />I also vow that the next time I'm in a hospital and a white-coated, badged, stethoscoped person approaches me with a needle in hand, I'm going to ask, \\"Have you ever performed this procedure before?\\"<br /><br />Thanks, Dr. Klass.  I'm trying not to be a gomer (Get Out of My Emergency Room), and I'm definitely not CTD (Circling The Drain), but if it really takes some medical students seven punctures to complete a spinal tap, then I'd rather have someone with a bit more experience perform the procedure on me.takes some medical students seven punctures to complete a spinal tap, then I'd rather have someone with a bit more experience perform the procedure on me. <br />	2004-11-15

I don't want to give away the plot, gimmicky though it is.  Read \\"The Three Coffins\\" for a few good shudders.<br /><br />In \\"The Crooked Hinge\\" all of the characters act suspiciously, including the true and false heir to the extensive Farnleigh estate (and the title that goes with it), their two lawyers, the butler, Lady Farnleigh, and assorted family friends.  The reader has many reasons to suspect each character in turn after the murder (or was it suicide?) of one of the two competing heirs.  The only person who might be able to tell whether the true John Farnleigh died or still lives is his tutor, Murray who happens to have taken a thumb-o-graph of young John before he was sent away to America to live with a distant relative.<br /><br />John wasn't the heir, but the black sheep of the family when he was packed off to Colorado via the spanking, new ocean liner, 'Titanic.'  He was thought to have died when his ship sank on her maiden voyage, but after his older brother dies without issue, not one but two John Farnleighs show up within a year of each other to claim the family estate and title.  The first one to appear marries John's childhood sweetheart and settles down to manage Farnleigh.<br /><br />Then up pops John Farnleigh #2, one of the competing heirs dies, and someone steals Murray's thumb-o-graph.  The reader is beset with conflicting stories and clues, when Dr. Fell finally lumbers onto the scene with his shovel-hat, swirling cape, and crutch-headed cane.  He figures out who killed whom right away, but the reader is left grasping at hints (some of them pretty darn subtle - I think Carr cheats a little on this mystery) until the final denouement, which involves that fateful night when the 'Titanic' went down.<br /><br />\\"The Case of the Constant Suicides\\" (1941) is a fun read and one of the author's more interesting mysteries--three men die and the reader must determine who committed suicide and who was murdered.  This book is very much of a howdunit as well as a whodunit. The humungous Dr. Gideon Fell, galumphs into view about a third of the way through, after one man is already mysteriously deceased.  Old Angus Campbell meets his end after plunging out of the window of his locked tower bedroom.  The door has to be broken down in order for the deceased man's bedroom to be examined.  The only unusual object in the tower room is an empty animal carrier, its wire-mesh door tightly shut.<br /><br />John Dickson Carr takes a turn to heavy-handed humor in \\"The Case of the Constant Suicides.\\"  Most of the roistering is caused by a malt whiskey called 'the Doom of the Campbells.'  A pesky American newspaperman is drenched, shot at, and hunted from the castle grounds whenever the Doom is flowing through the inhabitants of the castle.

Marion Crawford was one of the most prolific, widely-read novelists of the English-speaking world--a sort of Sidney Sheldon of the Edwardian era.  Now, his novels are banished to the musty shelves of old-fashioned romance and historical fiction, but his supernatural tales live on, most especially \\"The Upper Berth\\" and \\"The Screaming Skull.\\"<br /><br />Lee Weinstein has collected all eight of Crawford's supernatural stories, some of them gothic in the extreme, others oozing pathos.  But this author was at his best when writing of the sea and its unforgiving dead.  Many of his stories retain a place of honor in ghostly anthologies for their atmosphere of slowly-building horror.  I am in agreement with Lee Weinstein when he says, \\"One can only regret that he did not write more of them.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Dead Smile\\"--A gothic tale of forbidden love and vengeance from beyond the tomb.  We 21st century readers are a bit more used to dealing with the theme of incest, but when Crawford published this tale, it must have shocked many Victorian sensibilities.  Incestuous hints abound.  The evil, dying Sir Hugh Ockram, his son, and his son's fianc&eacute;e all have the same hellish smile:  \\"...She smiled--and the smile was like the shadow of death and the seal of damnation upon her pure, young face.\\"  The best scenes are in the vault below the castle, where the Lords of Ockram lie in burial shrouds, but not entombed.<br /><br />\\"The Screaming Skull\\"--A doctor murders his wife by pouring molten lead in her ear.  He dies mysteriously with his throat torn out.  The old seaman who inherits the doctor's cottage also inherits a skull in a hat box.  Something inside the skull rattles when he shakes it. When he tries to get rid of the skull, the screams begin.<br /><br />\\"Man Overboard!\\"--This story was worth the price of the book for me, because I'd never seen it before, and it's a great ghost story.  Just let the obscure nautical language flow past you, e.g. \\"I coiled down the mizzen-topsail downhaul myself, and was going aft to see how she headed up...\\"  This is a story of identical twin brothers who both love the same woman.  When they go to sea on the 'Boston Belle,' one brother is swept overboard during a storm and drowns--but somehow remains part of the crew.  As is true in most supernatural stories featuring a wedding, the innocent bride meets a horrible fate.<br /><br />\\"For the Blood is the Life\\"--I don't much care for vampire stories, but this one is wonderfully eerie.  Two men are dining on the roof of an old tower-fortress on the Southern Italian coast.  After moonrise, the guest sees a figure lying on a mound of earth near the tower and goes to investigate.  When he returns, his host tells him the story of the grave-mound.<br /><br />\\"The Upper Berth\\"--A business traveler who makes many Atlantic crossings secures a berth on the 'Kamchatka,' bound for Liverpool.  He requests a room with a double bunk and is disappointed to learn that he will have a roommate in the upper berth.  The first night of the voyage, his roommate runs screaming out of the small room and throws himself overboard.  The business traveler learns that three other men who booked into room 105 have killed themselves in the same fashion, and he is determined to investigate.<br /><br />\\"By the Waters of Paradise\\"--A gothic tale that has a happy ending for a change.  A melancholy young man is raised by his superstitious Welsh nurse in an ancestral castle, surrounded by gardens and fountains.  One night the old nurse sees \\"One--two leaden coffins, fallen from the ceiling!\\"  Sure enough, his parents die, and the nurse tells her charge the story of the Woman of the Water.  Will the new lord of Cairngorm be able to escape the curse?<br /><br />\\"The Doll's Ghost\\"--An old man repairs a rich girl's doll and becomes so fond of it he can hardly bear to part with it.  Finally, he instructs his young daughter to return the doll to itsowner.  The daughter doesn't return, but the doll does.<br /><br />\\"The King's Messenger\\"--A man is seated between a lovely young girl and her beloved at a dinner party, and learns that his right-hand neighbor is the King's Messenger.

For one thing, he is no longer officially a policeman.  Colonel Tommy Pride is the local Chief Constable, and Appleby isn't sure whether he likes him.  When he comes face-to-face with Colonel Pride at a church fête on Allington's estate, they bristle at each other distrustfully.<br /><br />Then Appleby realizes that Colonel Pride is practically his double.  They are both elderly men with a military bearing.  Both are wearing tweeds and almost identical green trilbys.  In fact:  \\"If he and Pride...were to hunch themselves down on each side of a fireplace, the effect would be... that of ...twinned china dogs...\\"<br /><br />In later novels, Sir John and Colonel Pride become good friends (see \\"Appleby's Other Story\\" (1974)), but in \\"Death by Water\\" (1968) they are still wary of each other.  Nevertheless, Pride supplies the police power necessary to tow a car and corpse out of their host's ornamental pond, and supplies Appleby with the information he needs to solve a series of mysterious deaths.<br /><br />One might refer to Colonel Pride as Appleby's Lestrade, even to a bit of bumbling on the Chief Constable's part.<br /><br />Michael Innes combines many themes that he has used in other Appleby mysteries:  buried treasure; mysterious scientists; eccentric rectors; feuding relatives; and just a touch of spy story.  Intellectual arrogance, as in many of Innes's novels is the villain's Achilles' heel.<br /><br />Never, I warn you, never invite Sir John to dinner, to a church fête, or to your sound-and-light show on the castle parapet if murder is to follow.<br /><br />Michael Innes (John Innes Mackintosh Stewart) was born in Edinburgh, educated at Oxford, and taught English in universities all over the world.

Look south.\\"<br /><br />\\"Judith looked south---which was towards what Appleby had called the secondary motor road.

What you saw was a silver-grey Rolls-Royce Phantom V.'<br /><br />\\"'My dear John, it's terribly vulgar to name cars---particularly astoundingly expensive ones.  It's only done by cheap novelists.  You must just say: `a very large car.''<br /><br />\\"Appleby received this with hilarity.\\"<br /><br />Eventually (you knew this was going to happen), the Applebys find a body floating face-down in the scummy canal-water.  The quest for the murderer of returned prodigal, Seth Crabtree, proceeds in the leisurely fashion of a Golden Age British manor house mystery.  It is leavened, as are all of Michael Innes's novels, with a great deal of erudite wit and conversation.  It has not one, but two snobbish butlers, and also features Judith's eccentric great-uncle, Colonel Raven whose life's work-in-progress is the \\"Atlas and Entomology of the Dry-Fly Streams of England.\\"<br /><br />If you are a already a fan of Margery Allingham, Edmund Crispin, or Dorothy Sayers, you definitely need to add Michael Innes's mysteries to your reading list.  \\"The Crabtree Affair\\" is perfect in its class, and you will also learn quite a bit about the English Canal system.nversation.

She beguiles him with gothic tales that were written by her Victorian great-uncle, Ranulph--tales that are now seemingly coming true.  Marble cows and pigs are being substituted for unsuspecting livestock.  Her brother Luke received a personalized tombstone in the mail, with his date of death carved on it.  Spot, the horse is found hitched up to the carriage, facing backward.  These all seem like minor pranks.  Then Judith and John stumble across a dead body buried neck-deep in the snow on their way home from the haystack.<br /><br />Judith, herself a sculptor lives in Long Dream Manor, along with a parcel of eccentric relatives and retainers.  This is certainly the perfect set of in-laws for Detective Inspector Appleby, who is sometimes referred to by his colleagues as 'that wayward Appleby.'  In fact at one point in this mystery, we find him wistfully thinking, \\"Would it not be pleasant to retire from the elucidating of crime and give oneself to the creating of unashamed fantasies--in which champion milkers might turn to marble at one's whim...\\"<br /><br />This is the first of the Appleby mysteries in which the reader is introduced to the Ur-folk.  It never fails to astonish me how much information a good author can pack into the monosyllabic expression, 'Ur.'  This conversational art reaches its zenith in \\"Night of Errors\\" (1948) which is inhabited by a butler by the name of Swindle, whose utterances consist mainly of the croaked \\"Urrr\\" sound and displeasing snuffles through his nose.<br /><br />I have to read the Innes novels at least twice before I really understand the plot and the subtleties of conversation, but his mysteries are certainly worth rereading.  If you are a fan of the British Golden Age of Mystery, I can almost guarantee that Michael Innes (J.I.M.

Crusty old Professor Childermass (a series regular) vanishes early on, to be replaced by crusty old Irish-American priest, Father Higgins, who brandishes a silver crucifix and rescues Johnny in the nick of some very frightening situations.<br /><br />Johnny is a shy, likeable boy who tries to act brave in spite of thinking himself a coward. His lower lip quivers almost continuously as he and his friend Fergie set out to find the missing professor. (He has every reason to be nervous in a story that reminds me of \\"The Haunted Doll's House\\" by that master of horror himself: M. R. James). For reasons that remain a mystery until the last few pages, our youthful hero is plagued by a tiny human skull and an ominous jack-o-lantern after his friend, Professor Childermass disappears.<br /><br />As skeletons, demons, and a haunted clock all conspire to make Johnny's life miserable, Fergie and Father Higgins pitch in to help him. The climax to \\"The Spell of the Sorcerer's Skull\\" takes place on a remote rock off the coast of Maine, appropriately named 'Cemetery Island.'<br /><br />The book is set in the nostalgic early 1950s (Johnny's father is a fighter pilot in Korea), but you won't have much time to feel nostalgia. You'll be too busy feeling scared. One of the reliable features of John Bellairs's adolescent fiction is that he doesn't try to make his ghosts cuddly or mawkish, like so many so-called 'teen-age horror' authors.	2004-10-24

When the gifted neurologist wrote his autobiography, he also wrote a history of chemistry as recapitulated through his own childhood experiences. He grew up in a very scientific family--his mother and father were physicians, and his uncle Dave (the 'Uncle Tungsten' of the title) was both a chemist and a business entrepreneur, who \\"would spend hundreds of hours watching all the processes in his factories: the sintering and drawing of the tungsten, the making of the coiled coils and molybdenum supports for the filaments, the filling of the bulbs with argon...\\"<br /><br />Uncle Tungsten allowed his nephew to perform chemical experiments in his laboratory, which contained samples of almost every element. Oliver's \\"physics uncle,\\" Uncle Abe had a small telescopic observatory on top of his house, where he demonstrated the wonders of spectroscopy to his nephew: \\"The whole visible universe--planets, stars, distant galaxies--presented itself for spectroscopic analysis, and I got a vertiginous, almost ecstatic satisfaction from seeing familiar terrestrial elements out in space, seeing what I had known only intellectually before, that the elements were not just terrestrial but cosmic, were indeed the building blocks of the universe.\\"<br /><br />No wonder young Oliver grew up with a love for the elements and their chemistry!<br /><br />Rarely do I read an autobiography and envy the author his childhood--most recent examples of this genre, e.g. \\"A Child Called 'It'\\" are grim, wailing texts--and that's not to say that Oliver didn't have his bad moments, too. He endured two horrible years at a Dickensian boarding school while London was being bombed by the Germans.<br /><br />For the most part though, his formative years were spent in a fantastic 'castle of the elements' where his \\"many uncles and aunts and cousins served as a sort of archive or reference library\\" to his enquiring mind.<br /><br />In \\"Uncle Tungsten,\\" Dr. Sacks shares his learning experiences with us and in the process, writes a far more lucid history of chemistry and physics than any I've ever found in a textbook. He also takes his readers on a mesmerizing, personalized tour of the elements. If you enjoyed P.W.

LeFanu	Books	5	23	25	N	N	Deceased judges, a vampire, & a nasty supernatural monkey	Until the Dover edition of Sheridan Le Fanu's stories appeared in 1964, this nineteenth-century Irish author's tales were almost impossible to find.  This is a shame, since M.R. James considered Le Fanu the best of all ghost story writers (I would put M.R. James at the top of my list, and J. S. Le Fanu, second).  According to Jack Sullivan in \\"Elegant Nightmares:  The English Ghost Story from Le Fanu to Blackwood,\\" \\"...Nearly all of the early twentieth-century writers in the [supernatural story] field paced and structured their narratives in the Le Fanu manner.\\"<br /><br />This edition has an introduction by E.F. Bleiler who limns a brief biography of the author, and his influence on the ghost story writers who followed him.  The sixteen stories in this collection range from 1837 to 1871.  One is an essay presented as non-fiction, i.e. \\"An Authentic Narrative of a Haunted House.\\"  Concerning this essay, Bleiler states, \\"Personally, I am inclined to accept Le Fanu's strong statement that he was not writing fiction in the guise of fact, and that he is simple reproducing what others had told him.\\"<br /><br />Some of the stories are obscured by dialect, e.g. \\"Madame Crowl's Ghost\\" and parts of \\"The Haunted Baronet.\\"  Lines like \\"...twad gar ye dodder to hear him\\" can usually be worked out in the context of the plot and Le Fanu's stories are worth the extra effort.  Quoting Jack Sullivan again, \\"Le Fanu's tales suggest a world in which we are unbearably alone in situations of escalating awfulness.\\"  The little maid is sleeping alone in one of Madame Crowl's chambers when the old beldame's ghost appears, \\"her eyes as wide as saucers, and her face like the fiend himself.\\"  Rose in \\"Schalken the Painter\\" is deserted by her guardian and minister after she begs them not to leave her alone, and she is doomed.  In one of my favorite stories, \\"An Account of some Strange Disturbances in Aungier Street,\\" two medical students move into a house once owned by an infamous, hanging judge.  They are afraid to tell each other about their supernatural encounters for fear of being mocked--at least until one of them almost dies.<br /><br />This book is the finest collection of Le Fanu stories ever compiled, and all ghost story connoisseurs should hasten to read it.judge.

In most of these SF novels, Norton describes the ancient Forerunner ruins as vast, underground high technology installations where ordinary human beings can be driven crazy just by the odd angles to the walls, the mazes and tunnels where they're always getting lost, or by the harmful emanations from the ancient and only partly understood machines.<br /><br />In \\"Forerunner\\" (1981) and its sequel, \\"Forerunner: The Second Venture\\" (1985), author Norton veers off the super technology highway and onto the mythical road of nature/nurture goddesses.  All of a sudden, Forerunners (at least one of them) bear a strong resemblance to Ceres, Persephone, and (if you follow the Witch World novels) Gunnora.  In Andre Norton's universe, there was more than one race that preceded humans into space.  I just wish that she had differentiated between the technology-based Forerunner civilizations, and the Forerunner civilization that is explicated in this novel, which seems very anti-technology.<br /><br />\\"Forerunner\\" begins in the ancient port of Kuxortal, which has built and rebuilt itself upon the ruins of ancient and decayed civilizations.  The lowly Burrow-dwellers sometimes discover artifacts from the past as they tunnel beneath the current city's towers.<br /><br />Simsa had been a runner and fetcher for an old Burrow-dweller, \\"until the mists of the riverside burrow bit so far into Old One's crippled bones that her body at last gave up...\\"  She buries her mentor, who had probably rescued Simsa off of a garbage heap as an infant.  The old cripple never revealed Simsa's origin to her, but it was obvious that the girl was different from any of the other Burrow-dwellers.  Simsa tries to hide her differences--her platinum hair combined with blue-black skin, but she must flee from her only known home when scavengers attempt to loot the treasures that Simsa's ancient mentor had purportedly hidden there.  The scavengers also consider Simsa part of the loot, but she fights her way free with the assistance of her retractable claws and her pet zorsal.<br /><br />Zorsals are one of the best features of this book.  They are cute, bat-like creatures with four paws and feathery antennae.  Simsa is able to communicate with them on a very primitive thought-band, and they play an integral role in her adventure.<br /><br />Now that Simsa has been driven from Ferwar's burrow, she attempts to sell her mentor's treasured artifacts to an off-world man who has come to Kuxortal in search of his missing brother.  He in turn persuades her to accompany him to the deadly Hard Hills where his historian-brother was last seen.<br /><br />After a long, difficult journey through the desert, where Simsa and her zorsals almost perish, she and Thom, the outworlder reach the Hard Hills and discover an ancient, alien city.  It is here that Simsa learns of her true origin.<br /><br />There are nice Norton touches in \\"Forerunner:\\" the zorsals; the underground healing pool; Simsa's hard and dangerous life in the Burrows; her difficult journey through the desert with Thom.  However, the plot is muddied up with too many villains--greedy Guild Lords and skyjackers ('jacks' in Norton's terminology), and too many variations on the nature of the Forerunners.<br /><br />I also preferred the Simsa at the book's beginning to the Simsa at the end.<br /><br />However, the zorsals were wonderful throughout.e must flee from her only known home when scavengers attempt to loot the treasures that Simsa's ancient mentor had purportedly hidden there.

Lesser authors have butted into the series, presumably with Norton's permission since this remarkable Gandalf Grand Master of Fantasy and Nebula Grand Master is still writing (her first novel was published in 1934, her latest fantasy in 2002).<br /><br />One Solar Queen rip-off to avoid at all costs is \\"Redline: the Stars.\\"<br /><br />Norton's Solar Queen stories are told from the viewpoint of Dane Thorson, an apprentice-Cargo Master who is introduced as a \\"lanky, very young man in an ill-fitting Trader's tunic.\\"  Most of this author's heroes and heroines are young, uncertain of themselves, shy, with a tendency to trip over their own enthusiasms and load themselves up with guilt at the slightest opportunity.  They are very likeable and their adventures are narrated in remarkably lean prose with just the right touch of description.<br /><br />After ten years of schooling, orphan Dane Thorson is assigned via a computer analysis of his psychological profile--not to a safe berth on a sleek Company-run starship that his classmates were vying for--but to a battered tramp of a Free Trader. To say that the 'Solar Queen' \\"lacked a great many refinements and luxurious fittings which the Company ships boasted\\" was an understatement.  But she was a tightly-run ship and what she lacked in refinement, she made up for in adventure.  Dane soon settles in under Cargo Master Van Rycke and learns \\"to his dismay what large gaps unfortunately existed in his training.\\"<br /><br />Sometimes I just want to give Dane a big hug.<br /><br />The crew of the 'Solar Queen' risk their meager capital in a gamble at a Survey auction, and win trading rights to a barely explored planet with the unlucky name of Limbo.  When they view a microfilm (okay, the technology is a bit dated in these books) of their new prize, it appears as though they have purchased ten years of trading rights to a planet that was burned to cinder during the heyday of the mysterious Forerunners, who predated humans in space.<br /><br />Just when the Queen's fortune seems to be at its lowest ebb, a tough-looking archeologist shows up who is supposedly an expert on Forerunner artifacts, and charters her for a voyage to Limbo.<br /><br />It might have been better for the free traders if her captain had kept his ship planeted and declared bankruptcy after the disastrous Survey auction.<br /><br />\\"Plague Ship\\" takes the crew of the 'Solar Queen' to Sargol, where the enigmatic feline natives seem very reluctant to trade away their fabulous scented gemstones.  When Dane Thorson discovers an herb that the Salariki are willing to swap for their gems, he fears that his eagerness to make a trade breakthrough might have poisoned a native child.  That becomes the least of his worries when the 'Solar Queen' blasts off from Sargol with an invisible, undetectable stowaway that would brand the free traders anathema to all inhabited worlds.<br /><br />Both of these Solar Queen novels are prime representatives of Norton's lean action-packed brand of story-telling.  If you haven't read them since you were a teen-ager, I urge you to try them again.  For a few pleasant hours, you will be immersed in the adventures of a likeable, feisty band of free traders on exotic, carefully-drawn alien worlds.gaps unfortunately existed in his training.\\"   <br />  <br />Sometimes I just want to give Dane a big hug. <br /> <br />The crew of the 'Solar Queen' risk their meager capital in a gamble at a Survey auction, and win trading rights to a barely explored planet with the unlucky name of Limbo.

This dark, water-bound environment is often a river of rebirth for Norton's heroes.  In \\"Warlock of the Witch World\\" the hero, Kemoc is guided through a watery underworld by the amphibious, amorphous Orsya who defies her own people to aid him in his quest.<br /><br />Kemoc Tregarth was born one of three triplets.  His birth-sister Kaththea was gifted with witchery.  His brother, Kyllan became a warrior.  Kemoc himself was gifted with wisdom, but as he states it, \\"...my wisdom consists in knowing that I know very little, though the thirst for learning has ever been in me.\\"<br /><br />At the very least, you probably need to read \\"Three Against the Witch World\\" (1965) as a precursor to 'Warlock' (1967), in order to learn about the hidden land of Escore, the magical sister-state of witch-ruled Estcarp that lies to the forbidden East in \\"trembling balance between the forces of Light and those of the Dark.\\"  When Kaththea, Kemoc, and Kyllan flee to Escore, they accidentally destroy the false peace that had long abode there between the great powers of Light and Dark.  \\"Things awoke and gathered, and the land was troubled...\\" and the three learn that they must fight with the forces of Light, or be utterly annihilated by the Dark.<br /><br />Kemoc sets out to win allies among the Krogan, who made their homes in the lakes, rivers, and waterways of Escore.  When he returns from this failed mission, there are many other battles to be fought in the now-troubled land.  During one such engagement, Kemoc is wounded and is almost captured by minions of the Dark, but is saved by the Krogan maid, Orsya.  When Kemoc finally reaches the safety of the Valley of Green Silences, he discovers that his birth-sister Kaththea has ridden off to the stronghold of an apparent ally, Dinzil.  However, Kemoc suspects that the fair-seeming man who wooed his sister is actually a creature of the Great Dark Ones.<br /><br />Off he goes on another quest into the magic-troubled land, where he meets with the gnarled Moss Wives, and Loskeetha of the Garden of Stones, Reader of Sands.  Loskeetha shows Kemoc three separate futures--all which end in the death of his birth-sister, Kaththea, twice by his own hand!<br /><br />A greatly troubled Kemoc continues his search for Kaththea, with the help of his web-fingered, silver-haired friend, Orsya.<br /><br />This is an eerie, compelling fantasy with many allusions (intended or not) to Wagner's \\"Rheingold.\\"  It doesn't have a happy, fairytale ending and you must certainly read the sequel, \\"Sorceress of the Witch World\\" (1968) in order to experience a good, satisfying thumping of the Great Dark Ones.<br /><br />Andre Norton is a powerful mythmaker and world-builder, and her fantasies concerning the triplets Kemoc, Kaththea, and Kyllan (\\"Three Against the Witch World,\\" \\"Warlock of the Witch World,\\" and \\"Sorceress of the Witch World\\") do not suffer in comparison with Ursula K.

While separated from his patrol by a storm, he discovers the hilt of an ancient sword---an artifact of the vanished Great Adepts of magic.<br /><br />Oh, no!  All WW fans know that ancient artifacts are better left untouched.  But Yonan feels a compulsion to rescue the sword hilt from its imprisoning stone, and so the original wielder of the Sword of Ice is able to reincarnate himself within Yonan.  Yonan-now-Tolar forges a magical blade for his sword, rescues his friend Uruk of the Ax from a pillar of ice, and together they hurtle back through time to refight the Lost Battle of Witch World.<br /><br />Before they bid farewell to the present, Yonan-now-Tolar and Uruk rescue Yonan's childhood companion, the untrained witch, Crytha from the filthy, claustrophobic burrows of the Rasti.<br /><br />Crytha then narrates the third story of the trilogy, \\"Sword of Shadows.\\"<br /><br />An untrained witch is a very dangerous thing to be in Escore: a vessel waiting to be filled with the wrong kind of magic---which is exactly what happens to Crytha.  She is put under a strong compulsion to obey an evil female magician named Laidan, who is plotting to reincarnate her lover, an adept of the darkest shadow who originally perished in the Lost Battle.  (Evil females in Norton stories are easily identified by their scarlet lips and wanton behavior.)<br /><br />How Crytha manages to foil the adepts of the Dark, with unexpected assistance from one of the Great Ones who had withdrawn from Witch World after the Lost Battle is the essence of \\"Sword of Shadows.\\"<br /><br />My only reason for withholding a star from my review is the very loosely constructed plot of \\"Trey of Swords.\\"  I never did quite comprehend why the Lost Battle of Witch World had to be refought.

The main narrator is Albert Routh, a seedy little conman who cheats housewives out of shillings and pence.  When he takes a turn on his two-stroke motorcycle toward the sleepy village of Milton Porcorum, he never dreams that by nightfall he will be the most hunted man in England.<br /><br />Jane and her fianc&eacute;, Geoffrey are both students at Oxford when Geoffrey goes missing.  A professor of Art History also discovers that his fianc&eacute;e and her child have vanished, and a posh asylum for alcoholics near Milton Porcorum seems to be involved with the misplaced fianc&eacute;s.  Conman Albert Routh is temporarily incarcerated at the asylum, which is also a center for biological research, and he escapes with a piece of paper that is the only copy of a mysterious formula.<br /><br />Now the hunt begins.<br /><br />This book has some of the best chase sequences in all of Innes, including the surreal climax in the vast subterranean stacks of the Bodleian Library by night.  It also has some of his wickedest villains who want nothing less than to induce the lions of humanity to lie down with its lambs.

The author's stated purpose is to \\"demystify, as far as possible, those predators in human form who have been with us since the dawn of history...\\"  Serial killers at large are so frightening that they end up touching all of our lives--most especially in the United States, where 84% of all known serial killers have committed their crimes since 1980.  I first became aware of this type of human predator when I was a student at the University of Michigan, and John Norman Collins was murdering coeds with pierced ears and long brown hair.  (Oddly enough, Collins is missing from this encyclopedia even though he killed at least seven women--possibly because he was only charged and tried for the murder of one of them.  A second edition is planned, so there is a possibility that this omission will be corrected).<br /><br />California native Michael Newton has published 181 books since 1977, including 147 novels but he is best known for his true crime and reference works.  I have to say that I assumed this author was British because of his concise, witty style and also for his tendency to critique other true crime authors who failed to get their facts straight, including the names of a serial killer's victims.  One of his special peeves is the term 'spree killer,' and he also doesn't seem to think much of profilers.<br /><br />Most of the entries in this encyclopedia are concerned with the serial killers themselves, whether they acted alone, in twosomes, or in packs.  One of the biggest surprises for me was the large number of serial killers who are or were women.  Something like 12% of all serial killers are female, and Hungarian women seem especially prone to this behavior, starting with Countess Erzsebet B&aacute;thory in the sixteenth century whose final body count was somewhere between 300 and 650 victims.  In the early 1900s,Vera Renczi murdered 35 husbands, lovers, and a son and was arrested by the police only after they searched her basement and discovered 35 zinc coffins.  \\"Some evenings, Vera liked to sit among the coffins in an armchair and enjoy the company of her adoring beaux.\\"  Then there were the \\"Angel Makers of Nagyrev\\"...<br /><br />Well, let me just close by remarking that \\"The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers\\" is an extremely interesting source of information on the darker side of human nature.  In addition to the encyclopedia entries, there are also appendices on \\"Solo Killers,\\" \\"Team Killers,\\" and \\"Unresolved Cases,\\" plus an extensive bibliography.earched her basement and discovered 35 zinc coffins.  \\"Some evenings, Vera liked to sit among the coffins in an armchair and enjoy the company of her adoring beaux.\\"  Then there were the \\"Angel Makers of Nagyrev\\"... <br /> <br />Well, let me just close by remarking that \\"The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers\\" is an extremely interesting source of information on the darker side of human nature.

The son of a town sheriff, he grew up above the Arctic Circle in the city of Tromsø, where his youthful impressions of the wild sea-going life provided material for many of the stories in this collection, first published in 1893.  \\"Weird Tales from Northern Seas\\" was originally written in Danish, which was the official language of Norway for many centuries.<br /><br />As you might expect from your reading of the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen these tales of the Northern Seas are not only weird, but grim.  Grimmer than Grimm I should say.  The supernatural beings that haunt the shores and depths of the sea are uniformly malignant--including the merfolk.  Even a seal \\"looked so evilly and viciously at him with its bloodshot eyes...that Elias thought he should have died on the spot for sheer fright.\\"<br /><br />Of course, the seal turns out to be a 'draug'--a demon peculiar to the northern Norwegian coast.  In revenge for a wound that Elias had inflicted on it, the draug lures the fisherman's entire family out to sea and kills all but one in a peculiarly horrible manner.<br /><br />And that's just the first story in this book.  \\"Finn Blood\\" which the editor refers to as \\"a charming love story\\" is filled with Finn-bashing, evil magic, and of course, draugs.  This story has a great line that summarizes the atmosphere of the whole book:'  \\"He ...laughed and grinned complacently at his own narrations, the humor of which was always a wreck or a drowning.\\"<br /><br />Grim as it may be, this is a wild and wonderful collection of eleven tales that are filled with the sound and deadly magic of the far North.	2004-10-14

However \\"In Xanadu\\" is an excellent book to take on vacation.  It is a lucid and sometimes hilarious account of a very low-budget journey through Asia ($1100 financed the entire trip through Israel, Cyprus, Turkey, Syria, Iran, Pakistan, and the breadth of China.)  And best of all, no matter how badly your own vacation turns out, you can always pick this book up and find Dalrymple in a more miserable spot than you are.<br /><br />There is also beauty and moments of scholarly excitement when the author identifies some feature of the landscape with a passage from Marco Polo's journal.  I particularly liked his description of a nocturnal train trip through Turkey.  He sees dry flatlands transformed into lush pasturage and wonders at the source of water.  Then the train comes upon a river, and Dalrymple unfolds his map:<br /><br />\\"Its Turkish name, the Firat Nehri, meant nothing to me.  Only when I followed the thin blue line down through Syria and out towards Baghdad, did I see the river's more familiar name --- the Euphrates....Is there another river which carries with it so many associations?...The river which ran through the Garden of Eden, one of the five rivers of the Apocalypse!  Following its course on the map, its banks are littered with the names of the ancient cities it once gave life to:  Mari, Nippur, Uruk, Larsa, Erdu, Kish.\\"<br /><br />The above paragraph is a rare flight of fancy for Dalrymple.  His normal style is less flamboyant, laced with dry British humor where he tends to be the butt of his own jokes.  Sometimes the reader is left to discover the humor of the situation through one of his dialogues.  Here Dalrymple is in Kashgar, a Chinese city populated by the Muslim Uigurs.  He is trying to explain through an interpreter, the lifestyle of the British `Chairman' Elizabeth II to an old mullah:<br /><br />\\"Salindi [the interpreter] frowned. `He wants to know how many sheep, donkeys and camels your chairman owns.'<br /><br />\\"'Tell him she owns no camels, but has very many horses and a great number of corgi dogs.'<br /><br />\\"The information was passed on.  The old man nodded his head as he listened.<br /><br />\\"'Sir, this man is now asking about the dog which is called `khor-qi.  He asks whether these `khor-qi' are good to eat.'<br /><br />\\"'Tell the old man that they are delicious.'\\"<br /><br />\\"In Xanadu\\" is travel writing in the grandly eccentric British tradition: a horrid climate and high adventure, laced throughout with dry wit.  Be sure to get a copy for your next vacation.  I'm going to loan mine to a friend who thinks she wants to visit Iran and Afghanistan (last year she trekked through Outer Mongolia).

The new Queen is young and inexperienced, and many doubt that she will be able to hold the twelve Crowns of Raine into one dominion.  One Crown openly revolts.  But that isn't the doom that the mages seem to sense.  The true doom of Raine has something to do with thorns.<br /><br />Deep in the library tunneled through the stone beneath the palace, an orphaned transcriptor is translating a book received from the mages of the Floating School.  It is written in an alphabet of thorn that only she can read.  Could a book about the conquests of an ancient king and his shadowy mage bring about the destruction of Raine?<br /><br />\\"Alphabet of Thorns\\" is a twining, cobwebby sort of tale.  The author strays into this elusive type of story-telling when there is no strong villain such as the Basilisk-prince or the evil Domina Pearl plotting and spinning at the center of her novel.  McKillip's \\"Ombria in Shadow\\" and \\"Eye of the Basilisk\\" are easier to read because of their villains.  This fantasy is a-brim with the author's quicksilver, magical descriptions but it doesn't proceed directly from Point A to Point B.  As much as the spirit is willing to linger in the wondrous Floating School for mages, or drink ponds of wine with the coronation guests, or descend to a hollow in the cliff where a skeleton sleeps \\"with a crown on its head and a great sword at its side,\\" the eyes do sometimes wander off to a book with a brisker plot.<br /><br />This is an intricate, spell-binding fantasy, but it's not McKillip's best.	2004-10-07

Aikman and later by R. Chetwynd-Hayes, no mean supernatural authors themselves. Some of the paperbacks in this series, which winds its way up to the \\"20th Fontana Book of Great Ghost Stories\\" are now collectors' items and worth over a hundred dollars apiece<br /><br />The eighth book in this series is the last that Robert Aickman (1914 - 1981) piloted.  As he says in his many introductions, he believes ghost stories are more akin to poetry than horror or science fiction.  His own stories in volumes 1 through 8 (excepting only volume 4) are darkly disturbing occult fantasies, with hardly a traditional ghost to be seen.  Nevertheless, two of them (\\"The Cicerones\\" and \\"The Inner Room\\") are on my list of the 50 greatest ghost stories.<br /><br />These are the stories in the 8th Fontana Book:<br /><br />\\"The Haunted Haven\\" by A.E. Ellis--A summer tourist learns why the fishermen of Ticklas Haven do not use the southern cove, \\"although it appears more sheltered and suitable in every way for use as a harbour...\\"  This story has a particularly nasty twist at its end.<br /><br />\\"The Red Lodge\\" by H.R. Wakefield--A family rents a summer house by a river and then learns that it is already inhabited by something that leaves patches of green slime on the floor, and in one memorable scene, on the narrator's face.<br /><br />\\"Meeting Mr. Millar\\" by Robert Aickman--A London writer is almost forced to give up his attic apartment when a noisy firm of chartered accountants moves onto one of the lower floors.  The noises at night are especially disturbing.<br /><br />\\"Midnight Express\\" by Alfred Noyes--\\"The Never-ending Story\\" with a horrific twist.  There is one illustration in a battered old book that a boy cannot bear to look at.  He pins two pages together to avoid the sight of \\"an empty railway platform--at night--lit by a single dreary lamp.\\"  Many years later, he finds himself on that platform at night, but not alone.<br /><br />\\"The Gorgon's Head\\" by Gertrude Bacon--A ship's captain narrates the story of a Greek island he once visited, where he found a valley filled with tall, black stones.<br /><br />\\"The Tree\\"--An Indian woman wishes her dying husband could gain the strength and life of an old oak outside her bedroom window.  Her husband regains his health and the oak dies, but at what cost?<br /><br />\\"The Haunted and the Haunters\\" by Lord Lytton--There is the kernel of a really decent ghost story in the midst of a whole lot of mystical blah-blah.  A man, his servant, and his dog attempt to spend the night in a haunted house.  The dog dies.  The servant runs screaming out the door and emigrates to Australia.  The man barely survives the night.  This is where you should stop reading.<br /><br />\\"Bezhin Lea\\" by Ivan Sergeivitch Turgenev--A grouse hunter gets lost on the steppes and is drawn to the camp fire of a group of horse drovers.  They have some very strange tales to tell.<br /><br />\\"The Last S&eacute;ance\\" by Agatha Christie--A man persuades his mediumistic fianc&eacute;e to perform just one more s&eacute;ance for a woman who has lost her only child--with predictably disastrous results.t, but not alone.    \\"The Gorgon's Head\\" by Gertrude Bacon--A ship's captain narrates the story of a Greek island he once visited, where he found a valley filled with tall, black stones.    \\"The Tree\\"--An Indian woman wishes her dying husband could gain the strength and life of an old oak outside her bedroom window.

The Geography of Death is lovingly delineated, from the prologue where Sabriel is born and dies and is rescued from the First Gate of Death by her father, to the third book in the trilogy, where the new Abhorsen braves Death in the form of a river, a waterfall, pools of black water, strange currents that suck the spirit from the flesh.<br /><br />Sabriel herself is an English schoolgirl, recently graduated from Wyverley Academy with a \\"first in English, equal first in Music, third in Mathematics, seventh in Science, second in Fighting Arts and fourth in Etiquette. She had also been a runaway first in Magic...\\" A visitation from the Dead sends Sabriel on a quest through the magical Old Kingdom, in order to reunite her father's body with his spirit which is trapped within the Fourth Gate of Death. She has to do battle with a really nasty necromancer-Adept, and rescue a prince who is a bit of a figurehead at first but who finally develops into a memorable character in his own right. Sabriel is both helped and hindered by a very non-cuddly cat named Mogget.<br /><br />\\"Lirael\\" is the middle book this remarkable fantasy series.  If I ever die and go to fantasy heaven, I hope it resembles Nix's immense library beneath glacier and mountain, where each door opens into a separate mystery.  In the catacombs beneath the library, Lirael discovers how to turn herself into an ice otter or a barking owl, reads \\"The Book of Remembrance and Forgetting\\", and duels with the monstrous Stilken.<br /><br />However, \\"Lirael\\" isn't just about Lirael.  Prince Sameth, heir apparent to Sabriel as the Old Kingdom's champion against evil necromancers, also comes of age in this volume.  There are plenty of evil necromancers to go around.  In fact, at the end of this book, it appears as though they are winning the war to turn the Old Kingdom into a kingdom of the dead.<br /><br />\\"Abhorsen\\" is a direct continuation of \\"Lirael,\\" with the ex-assistant librarian and her companion, Prince Sameth carrying on the battle against Hedge and the evil he is digging up at Red Lake.  Although Prince Sameth was meant to be the Abhorsen-in-Waiting, heir to the powers of 'The Book of the Dead' and the seven bells, Lirael now takes up that role, and Sam seeks his destiny as a descendant of the mysterious Wallmakers, who built the barrier between the magical Old Kingdom and the mundane kingdom of Ancelstierre.  The two will need all of the magic they can conjure up against an enemy that threatens not only the Charter, but all living beings.<br /><br />The swirl and cross-currents of life gradually ebb as the dead pass through gate after gate on Garth Nix's nameless river--a river like Styx or Lethe that runs through each of our subconscious underworlds as a legacy of our water-bound gestation.

Ash-Tree Press's \\"A Pleasing Terror\\" (2001), contains the complete and heavily annotated supernatural writings of MRJ, and no true Monty fan should be without it.<br /><br />The next best collection, \\"Casting the Runes and Other Stories\\" edited by Michael Cox, contains most of MRJ's supernatural stories and is quite a bit cheaper than \\"A Pleasing Terror.\\"<br /><br />The following stories are included in \\"A Warning to the Curious and Other Ghost Stories\\":<br /><br />\\"The Haunted Doll's House\\"--This story was written for the library of the Queen's Doll's House, and somewhat resembles MRJ's \\"The Mezzotint\\" from the earlier \\"Ghost Stories of an Antiquary.\\"  Mr. Dillet buys an unusual doll house in the Strawberry Gothic fashion from an acquaintance, and sets it up in his bedroom.  \\"It was quite six feet long, including the Chapel or Oratory...and the stable on the right.\\"  The house is completely furnished and has several inhabitants, including \\"a gentleman and lady in blue satin and brocade, respectively...and a white haired old gentleman in a long linen night-dress and cap.\\"  When the house seems to come alive, it tells a ghastly tale of murder and revenge from beyond the grave.<br /><br />\\"The Uncommon Prayer-book\\"-- Mr. Davidson strikes up a conversation with an old gentleman on a train and is invited to view a disused Chapel.  MRJ engulfs his reader in quaint British dialects in this story of a prayer book that would not stay shut.<br /><br />\\"A Neighbour's Landmark\\"-- A gentleman spends a wet August afternoon in his host's library and discovers an old pamphlet with two lines from a country song, \\"That which walks in Betton Wood/ Knows why it walks or why it cries.\\" When the weather clears, he explores the part of his friend's property that used to be called 'Betton Wood.'<br /><br />\\"A View from a Hill\\"--A pair of field-glasses made by an old and rather unlikeable watch-maker reveal peculiar landscape features, including a gibbet and something hanging from it.

Their usual idea of relaxation is composing scatty limericks.  Sometimes the discussion becomes more serious.  One evening, the tutor Pettigrew proposes that the passage into manhood requires a rite of initiation.  Much to his regret, the discussion turns to the American concept of 'playing chicken.'<br /><br />That night after the tutor retires to bed, six of the reading-party pile into an ancient automobile and set out on their own version of the supposed American pastime.<br /><br />You may be wondering where Sir John Appleby makes his entrance into this moody thriller.  Not until page 96, well after the undergraduate David Henchman discovers a body on the moor and is hunted, shot at, temporarily corned in an abandoned bottle factory, and nearly run over.<br /><br />When David and Appleby return to the scene of the murder on lonely Knack Tor, they discover a body but it's not same one David found earlier.  Someone has made a switch, and  David slowly begins to realize that he and the Metropolitan Police Commissioner are involved in a second, much deadlier game of chicken.<br /><br />The best features of this mystery-thriller-coming-of-age novel are the perilous, extended chase scene after David discovers the first body, and his interplay with Appleby whom he at first mistakes for a middle-aged London bureaucrat.<br /><br />Innes writes this sort of brave, intelligent but basically innocent undergraduate coming-of-age- under-the-threat-of-death novel so very well.  His serial detective Appleby has gotten a trifle old and cynical, but when he assumes the role of stern but witty mentor-under-fire he is at his best.<br /><br />If you enjoy the type of thriller where an undergraduate romp turns deadly, try Innes's \\"The Secret Vanguard\\" (1940), \\"A Family Affair\\" (1969), \\"The Man from the Sea\\" (1955), \\"The Journeying Boy\\" (1949), or \\"Death at the Chase\\" (1970).<br /><br />You'll smile at the antics and earnest dialogues of Innes's young men and women right before your hair starts to stand up on the back of your neck, as they accidentally intrude on murder or conspiracy most foul.

Aikman and later by R. Chetwynd-Hayes, no mean supernatural authors themselves. Some of the paperbacks in this series, which winds its way up to the \\"20th Fontana Book of Great Ghost Stories\\" are now collectors' items and worth over a hundred dollars apiece.<br /><br />R. Chetwynd-Hayes has assembled an anthology of ghost stories that are both chilling and relatively unknown for this sixteenth book in the series.  If there can be said to be a theme, quite a few of the stories involve water in one phantasmagorical form or other.<br /><br />These are the stories in the 16th Fontana Book:<br /><br />\\"Canon Alberic's Scrap-Book\\" by M. R. James-- The original title for this story was 'A Curious Book,' and it is one of 'the' classical MRJ invocations of a scholar who unwittingly opens the wrong book and pays horribly for his misadventure.  This story was originally read aloud at an 1897 meeting of the Cambridge Chitchat Society, a literary gathering which met for \\"the promotion of rational conversation.\\"<br /><br />\\"Mariners\\" by Terry Tapp--A house constructed from the wreckage of the Spanish Armada has the appearance of a great, land-locked galleon.  When an American doctor spends the night at Mariners, he learns quite a bit about surgery as it was performed 400 years ago.<br /><br />\\"Beyond the Red Door\\" by Kenneth Hill--For a change, this author has chosen to write about a haunted computer room.<br /><br />\\"The Story of Medhans Lea\\" by E. and H. Heron-- Flaxman Low, psychic detective was the joint creation of Hesketh-Prichard and his mother, Kate, who published the tales under the pen name 'E. and H. Heron'.  In this story, a man signs a lease on a haunted house.  It seems that many years ago, a tutor took his pupil out into the shrubbery.  \\"Screams were heard, and when the child was brought in he was found to have lost his reason.\\"  The psychic detective is called to Medhans Lea to decipher the haunting.<br /><br />\\"Just for the Record\\" by Patricia Moynehan--A photographer who likes to take pictures at funerals finds herself haunted by a deceased disk jockey.<br /><br />\\"The Cook's Room\\" by Pansy Pakenham-- This story reminds me of \\"Cold Comfort Farm,\\" a comic novel published in 1932 by Stella Gibbons.  However, the ending is much more melancholy in this story of a cook turned out from her home after her old master dies.<br /><br />\\"Norton Camp\\" by William Charlton--The 19th Regiment would rather be posted to the leech-infested swamps of Malaysia than spend another night in Norton Camp.<br /><br />\\"The Prescription\\" by Marjorie Bowen--A physician swears he made a house call in the middle of the night, even though his friends try to persuade him that the house he visited has not been inhabited for a hundred years.<br /><br />\\"The Rock Garden\\" by Heather Vineham--Melanie inherits Briar Cottage and wants to tear out a weed-overgrown rock garden against the advice of her old housekeeper.  A history of the village reveals that plague victims were buried under those rocks.<br /><br />\\"Brickett Bottom\\" by Amyas Northcote--The Reverend Arthur Maydew takes his annual holiday by exchanging parsonages with an elderly clergyman.  His two daughters look forward to a period of quiet in a pleasant country neighborhood.  Unfortunately one of the daughters makes friends with some rather unseemly (or is it 'unseelie') neighbors.<br /><br />\\"The Swan\\" by Pamela Hansford Johnson--The body of a child is washed up on Pebble Beach.  Is it the little girl who liked to play with the china swan?<br /><br />\\"The Children and the Apple Tree\\" by Meg Buxton--A man who lost his wife and two children lives as a recluse on the bleak and barren North coast of Cornwall.  There he watches two children playing on the beach all summer long that no one else seems to be able to see.<br /><br />\\"The Water Ghost of Harrowby Hall\\" by John Kendrick Bangs--A drowned suicidehaunts the heir of Harrowby Hall by giving him a good soaking every Christmas Eve.  He decides to put an end to her damp reign.<br /><br />\\"Destination Glen Doll\\" by A. Scupham--Two young hikers in the rainy Scottish highlands are joined by a third man.  Or are they?<br /><br />\\"She Walks on Dry Land\\" by R. Chetwynd-Hayes--If a man looks upon this ghost's face, \\"he'll run screaming down to the sea and drown himself.\\"  Of course Charles Edward Devereux, Fourth Earl of Montcalm does not believe the superstitious villagers so he and his man decide to spend a night by the shore.ndrick Bangs--A drowned suicide haunts the heir of Harrowby Hall by giving him a good soaking every Christmas Eve.

Coonies are still solid, rugged cats, America's oldest natural longhaired breed. However, little changes have been encouraged such as Lynx-like tipping on the ears.  You will not find these changes in this book.  Go to your breed's official website for updates on standards that might not have existed in 1979.  Newer breeds such as American Curls, Selkirk Rexes, and Ragdolls are not included at all.<br /><br />\\"A Standard Guide to Cat Breeds\\" is interesting to read because it shows breeding as a work in progress.  The Persians in this book still have recognizable noses, since the British Cat Fancy didn't go for the extreme smushed-in nose of the American Persian.  So there are geographical differences as well as the deliberately encouraged breed traits that are too modern for this book.  The standards are British rather than North American--another point to consider if you are going to purchase this volume.<br /><br />Outdated as it may be, \\"A Standard Guide to Cat Breeds\\" is still packed with useful information on how to raise and show your breed of choice.  A history of the British Cat Fancy is included, as well one on Feline Genetics.  Each recognized breed of cat is usually given its own chapter with standards, history, and personality types.  Some lesser known breeds such as the Chartreuse must make do with a single paragraph and photograph.<br /><br />This book ends with a couple of short chapters on Feline Medicine and Feline Behavior.	2004-09-28

Some of the paperbacks in this series, which winds its way up to the \\"20th Fontana Book of Great Ghost Stories\\" are now collectors' items and worth over a hundred dollars apiece.<br /><br />For this first book in the series, Robert Aickman selected eleven supernatural tales, including his own \\"The Trains.\\"  He also writes an introduction in which he states, \\"There are only about thirty or forty first-class ghost stories in the whole of western literature.\\"<br /><br />That's a challenge indeed, since this complete series contains well over 200 ghost stories!<br /><br />These are the stories in the Fontana Book of Great Ghost Stories:<br /><br />\\"The Travelling Grave\\" by L.P. Hartley--This is definitely one of Aickman's 'first-class ghost stories' and it is funny in the full meaning of the phrase 'hysterically funny.'  A man is invited to spend a week-end in the country, arrives late and discovers that his host and the rest of the guests are playing a game of hide-and-seek.<br /><br />\\"The Ghost Ship\\" by Richard Middleton--This story is also humorous, but it lacks the hysterical edge of \\"The Travelling Grave.\\"  A ghostly galleon runs aground in the middle of a turnip field during a violent wind storm.  Unfortunately for the peace of a nearby village, the captain and his ghostly crew are very fond of rum.<br /><br />\\"Squire Toby's Will\\" by J. Sheridan Le Fanu--The roistering, hard-living Squire Toby dies, leaving his two sons at each other's throats through the provisions of his will.  The younger son inherits, then discovers another will leaving the property to his older brother.  While he dithers about what to do with it, the older brother dies.  After the burial, two mourners enter the mansion but are never seen to leave.<br /><br />\\"The Voice in the Night\\" by William Hope Hodgson--A ship becalmed in the Northern Pacific gets a strange visitor.  The last line of this story is particularly horrible:  \\"Then the oars were dipped, the boat shot out of the patch of light, and the--the thing went nodding into the mist.\\"<br /><br />\\"Three Miles Up\\" by Elizabeth Jane Howard--The English Canal System has some strange stories told about it, and this is one of the strangest and scariest.  Never pick up strangers who want to hitch a ride on your boat, even if she's willing to cook and do the laundry.<br /><br />\\"The Rocking-Horse Winner\\" by D.H. Lawrence--In order to help pay off his parents' debts, a little boy gets racing tips while riding his rocking horse.<br /><br />\\"The Wendigo\\" by Algernon Blackwood-- This author was a pantheist and a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, eventually branching out into Buddhism and Rosicrucianism, and his stories reveal a deep, mystical appreciation of Nature, with a capital 'N.'  He spent many summers in the backwoods of Canada and \\"The Wendigo\\" is probably the most eerie creation of this idyllic period in his life.<br /><br />\\"The Crown Derby Plate\\" by Marjorie Bowen--Martha Pym is missing one plate from her antique Crown Derby collection.  She would do almost anything to complete her set, but when the plate finally falls into her hands, she immediately gives it away.  So would you, considering the source.<br /><br />\\"The Trains\\" by Robert Aickman--Two lost hikers on the moors are forced to seek shelter from a rainstorm in a mansion built right over the top of a railroad.  MiMi and Margaret learn quite a bit about trains from their host whose grandfather built both the house and the railroad beneath it.  A woman seems to be hiding from them in the upper reaches of the house.<br /><br />\\"The Old Nurse's Story\\" by Mrs. Gaskell--Here's an old classic that all ghost story connoisseurs must read at least once.  A young orphan and her loving nursemaid must go to live with a distant great-aunt in Northumberland.  The five-year-old soon wins over her new relative and the staff of the once-grand mansion, but who is the little girl who keeps begging her to come out and play in the storm?<br /><br />\\"Seaton's Aunt\\" by Walter de la Mare--A rather unlikeable schoolboy has a repulsive aunt who seems to despise him.

Henri Bencolin, 'juge d'instruction' of the Seine, the head of the Parisian police.  He is accompanied by his friend, the American Jeff Marle, who narrates and serves as Bencolin's straight man, muscle, and the guy who falls for all of the smouldering, silk-bosomed, possibly murderous mademoiselles.  Think of Archie Goodwin knocking off deadly Parisian apaches and rescuing Chanel-clad damsels-in-distress at the instigation of a thin, neurotic, chain-smoking, Mephistophelean Nero Wolfe.<br /><br />In this case, the body of a pretty young woman is discovered draped across the waxen arms of the Satyr of Seine, in a murky, subterranean museum that very much resembles Madame Tussaud's (which, after all, started out as a waxworks exhibit in the pre-Revolution Palais Royale).  Soon it is difficult to tell the real corpses from the glassy-eyed, waxen tableaux such as the aforementioned Satyr, the Spanish Inquisitors and their wracked victims, or Marat lying backwards out of his tin bath, \\"his jaw fallen, the ribs starting through his bluish skin, a claw hand plucking at the knife in his bloody chest.\\"<br /><br />The waxworks museum also has a secret passageway that leads M. Bencolin and Jeff to the notorious Silver Key club, whose masked members indulge in midnight orgies of jazz, champagne, and secret assignations.<br /><br />John Dickson Carr descends from 'atmospheric' to 'lurid' in his Bencolin mysteries, and the midnight streets and night clubs of prewar Paris are a perfect setting for this tawdry, match-lit jewel of a mystery.  Let yourself go and prowl with this author through the green-lit grotto of the waxworks, mingle with the masked French aristocrats as they dance to \\"the fleshy beat of a tango\\" in the infamous Silver Key club, hide behind the lily-clad coffin of the young murder victim and spy on those who might have killed her.

However, there are still a few haunted rectories and English manor houses for us traditionalists<br /><br />These are the tales in the 18th Fontana Book of Great Ghost Stories:<br /><br />\\"Eye to Eye\\" by Roger F. Dunkley--Meyers knows something is wrong with the used Daimler \\"the moment he pulled the car door shut.\\"  Has it to do with a death already old or one that is yet to occur?<br /><br />\\"Housewarming\\" by Steve Rasnic Tem--Judith moves out of the inner city and into a quiet neighborhood in the suburbs before her nerves give way completely.

Reading \\"The Ill-Made Mute\\" was like looking through a series of Aubrey Beardsley drawings---the detail was minute, intense and unforgettable.  There was so much description, it almost overwhelmed the plot.<br /><br />In fact, there isn't much plot.  This is a story of a mute, facially-scarred amnesiac who sets out on a journey to find someone with the right kind of magic to heal her.  The plot is the journey, or the journey is the plot.  Along the way, the ill-made mute interacts with flying horses, flying galleons, an Irishman straight out of a Mike and Pat joke, a treasure cave, unstorms, pirates, King's rangers, and eldritch wights.  There is plenty of drama, and wondrous sights to see along the way.  Read slowly and savor the rich text.  Journey's end is only partially satisfying, but a wonderful sequel has already been published--\\"The Lady of the Sorrows\\"---I've already read it and it's even better than \\"The Ill-Made Mute.\\"  The third book of the trilogy, \\"The Battle of Evernight,\\" came out in April, 2003 and wasn't quite as good as the first two, but you should still read it for the rather puzzling climax to the series.	2004-09-19

This book is very much of a howdunit as well as a whodunit. Carr's serial detective, the humungous Dr. Gideon Fell, galumphs into view about a third of the way through, after one man is already mysteriously deceased.  Old Angus Campbell meets his end after plunging out of the window of his locked tower bedroom.  The door has to be broken down in order for the deceased man's bedroom to be examined.  The only unusual object in the tower room is an empty animal carrier, its wire-mesh door tightly shut.<br /><br />Professor of history, Alan Campbell and his second cousin Kathryn Campbell meet on the train taking them to Scotland and immediately dislike each other.  Too bad, because they are forced to share a sleeping compartment on the crowded, blacked-out train.  They bicker all the way to the Castle of Shira at Inverary where Angus had jumped or was forced from his bedroom window the previous week.<br /><br />Here they meet the insurance agent, the Castle's lawyer, and Angus's brother Colin arguing about whether Angus was murdered or done himself in.  Carr's serial detective, Dr. Gideon Fell wheezes and chuffs through the castle like an off-the-track steam engine, dropping mysterious hints as he goes.  Colin decides to spend a night in his brother's former bedroom, just to lay rumors of ghostly goings-on, and he too defenestrates himself.<br /><br />When a third man is found hanging in a locked fishing cabin, Dr. Fell sorts out the murder and attempted murder from the suicide, rewards the innocent, and sets a murderer free if only he will sign a fake confession.<br /><br />John Dickson Carr takes a turn to heavy-handed humor in \\"The Case of the Constant Suicides.\\"  Most of the roistering is caused by a malt whiskey called 'the Doom of the Campbells.'  A pesky American newspaperman is drenched, shot at, and hunted from the castle grounds whenever the Doom is flowing through the inhabitants of the castle.<br /><br />This isn't my favorite Gideon Fell mystery--for one thing, I'm not sure the murder weapon is really quite as effective as the author seems to assert--but it was fun to read.  There were more smiles than shudders, which suits me fine.rican newspaperman is drenched, shot at, and hunted from the castle grounds whenever the Doom is flowing through the inhabitants of the castle. <br /> <br />This isn't my favorite Gideon Fell mystery--for one thing, I'm not sure the murder weapon is really quite as effective as the author seems to assert--but it was fun to read.

If it were fiction, \\"Night\\" might be classified as a work `magical realism'.  Since it is non-fiction, the best classification I can come up with is `dream-state realism'.  The publishers of \\"Night\\" threw up their metaphorical hands and classified it as `psychology'.<br /><br />The photographs and paintings that Alvarez chose to accompany his text are particularly haunting.  One in particular: an untitled photograph by Roger Parry shows a dark room with a narrow beam of light streaming in through a half-opened door.  The photograph was taken from inside the room and a few objects can be dimly seen: a daguerrotype propped upside-down against the dark wainscoting; a length of rope that might be fastened into a noose.

Some of his best novels, I read more than once, but \\"Appleby Talking\\" (1954 - also known as \\"Dead Man's Shoes\\") is not one of them.  Michael Innes never seemed to put his heart into his Appleby short stories, and his lead character strikes one as prissy rather than ironic, pompous rather than discriminatingly donnish.  All of the color seems to have been leached from Innes's short-story characters, and the settings are hardly mentioned.  Appleby even resorts to bombastic tall tales, whereas in the novels he is admirably reticent and never resorts to braggadocio.<br /><br />The last story in \\"Appleby Talking\\" is forty-nine pages long--an embryonic novel perhaps that Innes didn't feel like completing. \\"Dead Man's Shoes\\" is a spy story involving a man who is supposedly seen on a train wearing one black shoe and one brown shoe.

Chetwynd-Hayes has assembled a worthy anthology of ghost stories that are both chilling and relatively unknown.  Even the humorous stories in this collection carry a supernatural bite, including the editor's \\"My Very Best Friend.\\"<br /><br />These are the tales in the 20th Fontana Book of Great Ghost Stories:<br /><br />\\"Aunt Hester\\" by Brian Lumley--A young girl accidentally discovers that she can switch bodies with her twin brother, with unforeseen consequences. He finally walks her body out of a window to keep Hester from doing her swap.  He moves to Australia to get away from her, but this isn't the end of their story.<br /><br />\\"Skin Deep\\" by Roger Malisson--A beautiful but insecure young woman finds work at a modeling agency and ends up marrying one of the top male models.  Their problems begin even before she dies.<br /><br />\\"How Fear Departed from the Long Gallery\\" by E. F. Benson--\\"Church-Peveril is a house so beset and frequented by specters...that none of the family...takes psychical phenomena with any seriousness.\\"  Except for the ghosts of twin boys who suffered a horrible death when they were only two-years-old.<br /><br />\\"Carrie Liddicoat's Cottage\\" by Meg Buxton--Strange folks keep showing up at the door of Moira Montague's renovated cottage.  Are they somehow connected with the ghostly cat on her mantle and the ghostly chickens roosting on her furniture?<br /><br />\\"The Diary of William Carpenter\\" by John Atkins--A man buys an old farmhouse for a song and discovers the diary of the previous resident.  This story has a pretty standard plot, but there's a surprising twist at the end.<br /><br />\\"The Roads of Donnington\\" by Rick Kennett--The ghost of Lawrence of Arabia reputedly rides his motorcycle through the country lanes of Dorset.  This ghost does the same Down Under on the roads of Donnington, and one of his distant relatives sets out to discover why he still rides.<br /><br />\\"The Running Tide\\" by Ex-Private X--A. M. Burrage (Ex-Private X) was a gifted writer of ghost stories, a couple of which are on my Top Fifty list, e.g. \\"The Sweeper\\" and \\"Smee.\\"  This story of a haunted inn is \\"creepy without being horrific and has some really first class characters\\" according to the editor.  There is also a cool parrot.<br /><br />\\"A Lady in the Night\\" by Dorothy K. Haynes--Right before she gives birth, a woman thinks she hears a streetwalker tapping up and down the road by her house.  Her imagination (or is it the pain medication?) supplies her with an image of the wayward woman, along with her supposedly gruesome fate.<br /><br />\\"The Villa D&eacute;sir&eacute;e\\" by May Sinclair--A young woman who can't afford an expensive hotel room in Monte Carlo, decides to spend her vacation at her fianc&eacute;'s villa nearby, even though her friends beg her not to spend the night there.  If not top 50, then definitely top 100 material.<br /><br />\\"Graveyard Lodge\\" by Heather Vineham--Ruth Ghavri and her Indian husband move into an old house that is almost surrounded by a neglected cemetery.  Darshama has seen the house before in a dream and believes he has some unfinished karmic business there.<br /><br />\\"Ordeal by Fire\\" by Gladys Law--A young couple finally locates an affordable bungalow near Oxford, after the husband is promoted and transferred.  Unfortunately, the wife has several near-misses with accidentally-started fires.<br /><br />\\"Our Lady of the Shadows\\" by Tony Richards--I don't think I ever want to go to Paris again after reading this story.  An American college student gets lost in thedark, narrow streets of the West Bank and follows a cloaked figure down into a grubby basement apartment to ask for directions.<br /><br />\\"The Rip Current\\" by Daphne Froome--A rather unusual story about a ghostly surfer.  Don't read this story if you have any fear at all of going into the water.  I found myself gasping for breath while reading it.<br /><br />\\"My Very Best Friend\\" by R. Chetwynd-Hayes--A young boy acquires an over-protective guardian angel who leaves a trail of death amongst his relatives, schoolmates, and wife-to-be.  I usually don't care for humorous ghost stories (yes, this one's humorous) but this is a good writer at his ironic best.

This editor could never be accused of selecting shabbily-written tales for his book, but he tends toward 'atmospheric' rather than 'frightening' ghost stories.  A perfect example of what I mean is \\"The Beckoning Fair One\\" by Oliver Onions--probably one of the most famous supernatural tales in this difficult genre, but the climax builds slowly through seventy-three languorous pages.

A young boy is sent to West Cornwall to live with his uncle, the vicar of the small, isolated fishing village of Polearn.  His uncle's hellfire sermons and a sinister, carved panel on the altar-rail are the only shadows on the boy's otherwise bucolic existence.<br /><br />\\"The End of the Flight\\" by W.

He is pleased with his accommodations until his host tells him the tale of his previous guest.<br /><br />\\"The Beckoning Fair One\\" by Oliver Onions--A middle-aged writer named Oleron searches for a cheaper place to live and is attracted to an old, boarded up house amidst the tenements and alleys of London.  His friend, Miss Bengough takes an unreasonable dislike to his new lodgings.  Oleron should have trusted her intuition.<br /><br />\\"The Dream\\" by A. J.

They build themselves a one-roomed hut and try to last out the long Northern night.  Then Something starts to rattle the latch on their door and leaves bloody, human footprints outside the hut.<br /><br />\\"No Ships Pass\\" by Lady Eleanor Smith--Yet another shipwrecked sailor manages to pull himself onto the beach of a beautiful tropical island.  There he finds survivors from previous maritime disasters, some of them hundreds of years old.<br /><br />\\"The Man Who Came Back\\" by William Gerhardt--An old man hopes that heaven \\"contains...an infinity of libraries, so that [he] may read, read, read into eternity...\\"  Does his wish come true?<br /><br />\\"The Visiting Star\\" by Robert Aickman--A young man who is temporarily staying in a bleak mining town discovers that his hotel is inhabited by some very strange guests when the local theatre's manager decides to resurrect an old play.searches for a cheaper place to live and is attracted to an old, boarded up house amidst the tenements and alleys of London.

"Appleby Plays Chicken" (1957)	A tutor and his reading-party of undergraduates spend a quiet fortnight at a Dartmoor inn, preparing for final examinations.  Their usual idea of relaxation is composing scatty limericks.  Sometimes the discussion becomes more serious.  One evening, the tutor Pettigrew proposes that the passage into manhood requires a rite of initiation.  Much to his regret, the discussion turns to the American concept of 'playing chicken.'<br /><br />That night after the tutor retires to bed, six of the reading-party pile into an ancient automobile and set out on their own version of the supposed American pastime.<br /><br />You may be wondering where Sir John Appleby makes his entrance into this moody thriller.  Not until page 96, well after the undergraduate David Henchman discovers a body on the moor and is hunted, shot at, temporarily cornered in an abandoned bottle factory, and nearly run over.<br /><br />When David and Appleby return to the scene of the murder on lonely Knack Tor, they discover a body but it's not same one David found earlier.  Someone has made a switch, and  David slowly begins to realize that he and the Metropolitan Police Commissioner are involved in a second, much deadlier game of chicken.<br /><br />The best features of this mystery-thriller-coming-of-age novel are the perilous, extended chase scene after David discovers the first body, and his interplay with Appleby whom he at first mistakes for a middle-aged London bureaucrat.<br /><br />Innes writes this sort of brave, intelligent but basically innocent undergraduate coming-of-age- under-the-threat-of-death novel so very well.  His serial detective Appleby has gotten a trifle old and cynical, but when he assumes the role of stern but witty mentor-under-fire he is at his best.<br /><br />If you enjoy the type of thriller where an undergraduate romp turns deadly, try Innes's \\"The Secret Vanguard\\" (1940), \\"A Family Affair\\" (1969), \\"The Man from the Sea\\" (1955), \\"The Journeying Boy\\" (1949), or \\"Death at the Chase\\" (1970).<br /><br />You'll smile at the antics and earnest dialogues of Innes's young men and women right before your hair starts to stand up on the back of your neck, as they accidentally intrude on murder or conspiracy most foul.  Poona stuff all around.and earnest dialogues of Innes's young men and women right before your hair starts to stand up on the back of your neck, as they accidentally intrude on murder or conspiracy most foul.

Chetwynd-Hayes has assembled an anthology of ghost stories that are both chilling and relatively unknown for this fifteenth book in the series.  He has refrained from including too many humorous stories in this collection, as is his usual habit.  Instead, he incorporates quite a few Christmas stories, including two you won't be able to guess from their titles.  England appears to be a bad place to spend the holidays, in spite of all that propaganda from Charles Dickens.<br /><br />These are the stories in the 15th Fontana Book:<br /><br />\\"The Man from Glasgow\\" by W.

Unfortunately, the shooting party is staying over in the haunted Varley Grange.

More unusually, this story is haunted by a deceased scientist.<br /><br />\\"John Charrington's Wedding\\" by E. Nesbit--A much-collected Victorian ghost story, and one of my top 50.  It's bad enough when brides are accidentally locked into chests or pursued by demon lovers, but when the groom is overheard telling his fianc&eacute;e, \\"My dear, my dear, I believe I should come from the dead if you wanted me!\\" watch out!<br /><br />\\"The Primrose Connection\\" by Margaret Chilvers-Cooper--A child with a companion visible only to herself is kidnapped by a couple who just lost their own daughter.<br /><br />\\"The Saving of a Soul\\" by Sir Richard Burton--At the castle of Weixelstein in Germany, a brave serving-wench helps lay a ghost.<br /><br />\\"No Living Man So Tall...\\" by Rosemary Timperley--Very good, very short story with its title borrowed from its last sentence.

But not for long.<br /><br />\\"Here Today...\\" by James Fisher--A man is offered a hundred pounds to stay overnight in a haunted house.

The Vegans are basically tourists, lingering among the ruins of the last non-radioactive territories on Earth.  The historical Three Days of War occurred between human and human, or rather between dirty bomb and dirty bomb.  The back cover of &#34;This Immortal&#34; ironically states &#34;Welcome to Earth (Pop. 60,000).&#34;  (Later in the text, we learn that Earth's population is more like four million).<br /><br />&#34;This Immortal&#34; (1966) was Zelazny's first SF novel, and it shared the Hugo Award for Best Science Fiction Novel of the Year with Frank Herbert's &#34;Dune,&#34; so it is no lightweight post-Apocalypse adventure story.  In fact, I think the best way to understand &#34;This Immortal&#34; is to read Lawrence Durrell's semi-autobiographical novels on the Greek Isles:  most especially &#34;Prospero's Cell&#34; and &#34;Reflections on a Marine Venus&#34;---or better yet, read Percy Shelley's &#34;Prometheus Unbound,&#34; which is referred to more than once in this novel.<br /><br />Like Shelley's Prometheus, Zelazny's hero, Conrad Nimikos is mankind's potential savior.  Like Prometheus, he suffers and almost self-destructs in trying to save his chosen people (the humans who remained on Earth).  Instead of stealing fire from the gods, he sets out to steal back Earth from the Vegans.<br /><br />At an earlier stage in his career (nobody knows quite how old he might be), Nimikos was a terrorist.  Now he has lost some of his destructive impulse (his hubris), and sets out to protect the Vegan, Cort Myshtigo in order to discover the alien's true purpose in touring Earth's remaining monuments.<br /><br />The real mystery of &#34;This Immortal&#34; is not so much the Vegan's intentions toward Earth as it is the true identity of Conrad Nomikos.  His mistress, Cassandra playfully refers to him as a 'kallikanzaros' (this is where I had to refer to my Durrell), which is a Greek term for a little cloven-hooved satyr, who causes mischief of every kind.  Conrad is a huge man, superhumanly strong, but he is also incredibly ugly and walks with a limp.<br /><br />Did he at one time have a cloven hoof?<br /><br />Like the kallikanzaros, Conrad is a trickster, and deceives Vegans and humans alike into thinking his previous incarnation, the terrorist leader 'Karaghiosis,' has died in a boating accident.<br /><br />Once more turning to Durrell, we learn that 'Karaghiosis' is a stock character in Greek drama--in fact, &#34;the embodiment of Greek character...based on the idea of the impoverished and downtrodden little man getting the better of the world around him by sheer cunning. Add to this the salt of a self-deprecating humour and you have the immortal Greek.&#34;<br /><br />So Nomikos-Karaghiosis-Prometheus is the embodiment of 'the immortal Greek,' who might or might not be---according to a hint at novel's end, plus references to the kallikanzaros---the Great God, Pan.<br /><br />Conrad himself refers to &#34;Prometheus Unbound&#34; as &#34;Percy B's dud epic,&#34; but then, all of Zelazny's heroes tend to be self-deprecating.<br /><br />Zelazny has succeeded in capturing the spirit of a people and place in &#34;This Immortal.&#34;  I think his Hugo was well-deserved.Conrad is a huge man, superhumanly strong, but he is also incredibly ugly and walks with a limp. <br /> <br />Did he at one time have a cloven hoof? <br /> <br />Like the kallikanzaros, Conrad is a trickster, and deceives Vegans and humans alike into thinking his previous incarnation, the terrorist leader 'Karaghiosis,' has died in a boating accident. <br />  <br />Once more turning to Durrell, we learn that 'Karaghiosis' is a stock character in Greek drama--in fact, \\"the embodiment of Greek character...based on the idea of the impoverished and downtrodden little man getting the better of the world around him by sheer cunning.

And they're really about Michigan climate and Michigan soils.  Someone didn't just go through and change, say 'Iowa' to 'Michigan' with a word processor, then rename the book.<br /><br />According to the authors, Michigan ranks third nationwide in the production of annual plants, so we must have a pretty decent climate for growing them.  I've only had a couple escape from their beds and attempt to take over the yard--the morning glory 'Grandpa Ott' and every kind of mallow I've ever tried--so don't be afraid to experiment.  Our winters usually exterminate the overly bold.<br /><br />The book begins with a pictorial guide called \\"The Flowers at a Glance\\" where photographs of the annuals are listed in alphabetical order, by common name.  There is a short introduction on trends in annuals and a map of the average last-frost dates for Michigan, so that you will know when to plant out depending on where you live.<br /><br />The next few sections explain how to start annuals, both by growing them from seed or by schlepping over to the nearest gardening center and buying them.  There are chapters on caring for annuals, and the obligatory chapter on 'Problems & Pests' before we plunge into the heart of this book:  the alphabetically-arranged sections on each of the 443 selected annuals.<br /><br />Each species is described, including height, spread, and flower color.  Each has subsections on 'Planting' (how and when to start your plants), 'Growing,' 'Tips,' 'Recommended' varieties, and (usually) 'Problems and Pests.'  There are over 400 color photographs, usually (but not always) labeled by variety, to help with your decisions on what to plant.  There is also a very nice 'Quick Reference Chart' in back that lists the colors, sowing method, height, hardiness, light and soil requirements for each species.<br /><br />There is even a short list of companies and their websites where you can purchase seed, although a couple of my favorites aren't mentioned, i.e. Thompson and Morgan, and Park Seed.<br /><br />Annuals are so much fun.  If you hate the color combinations you tried one year, you can start all over again the following spring.  Sometimes if you're lucky, a favorite annual like Love-in-a-Mist will reseed itself and return even more beautifully the following season.  Of course, that could also happen with pests like Grandpa Ott--we finally had to concede defeat after five years of weeding purple morning glories out of the vegetable beds.  We sold our house to someone who hopefully loves this old vine.your decisions on what to plant.

This collection from the Oxford University Press represents the oral tradition of fifteen peoples scattered across Northern Europe from Scandinavia, deep into Russia and beyond the Urals, and of the Hungarians in Central Europe.<br /><br />There are extensive footnotes that illuminate the tradition and meaning of the entries, some of which are fragments of larger, lost works. It is interesting to read a poem such as \\"To the Coffin-Makers,\\" and then turn to the commentary that explains Karelian burial traditions:<br /><br />\\"...The need to use timber from trees in which birds had not rested or sung (cf. II. 9-10) reflects a belief in soul-birds. It was essential to avoid upsetting the deceased---should he or she return in the form of a bird---by felling trees in which the soul might one day wish to rest.\\"<br /><br />One of the more recondite marriage traditions among the Finnish, Karelian, and Estonian peoples involved teasing the prospective bride and bride-groom: \\"The theme of seeking the best bride and finding the worst is a central feature....of the bride-teasing poems [that] were customarily sung by the groom's relatives at his home.\\" Here are a few lines from \\"Teasing the Bride:\\"<br /><br />\\"Listen, precious brother's son/ if you could but have taken an apple from higher boughs/ from the top of other trees!/...Attendants, you maid's brothers:/ take this away when you go/ the one you brought when you came!/ Don't take her along the road--/ take her over the big swamp!/ If you take her by the road/ even horses will stampede/ horseflies will take to their heels...\\"<br /><br />The oral tradition of our ancestors was often somber. It often attempted to explain our symbiosis with the natural and spiritual world. However, it could also be joyous. It could make people laugh.<br /><br />I think we've neglected the humorous, celebratory side of song-making and poetry in our modern world. \\"The Great Bear\\" reminds us that poems and songs were meant to reflect all facets of our humanity, not just grief, longing, and pain.s with the natural and spiritual world.

When he was born at ten minutes after midnight, March 30, 1970, his owner took one look at him and said, \\"There is a whopper.\\" His own firstborn was an Appaloosa colt named 'First Secretary'. Another son - a draft horse cross - is still alive and well and recently retired from the Southwest dressage circuit. Yet a third son won the Belmont by a margin of 21 lengths, in what was the second fastest running and third largest margin in history.<br /><br />Of course, his Daddy still holds the record for both margin and time.<br /><br />And who is Risen Star's Daddy?<br /><br />Secretariat, of course. No one who admires this special breed of horse could possibly have flunked this quiz.<br /><br />When we watched Big Red hit the wire 31 lengths ahead of Twice a Prince in 1973, crushing the Belmont stakes record by two seconds and change, many of us knew that we would not see his like again. According to his jockey, Ron Turcotte, Secretariat was retired before he had reached his full potential at the longer distances. We would have loved to watch that big red horse run all day and smash every record there was, but it was not to be.<br /><br />At any rate, reading William Nack's, \\"Secretariat: The Making of a Champion\\" is the next best thing to watching him run (unless you are lucky enough and rich enough to own one of his 'blue hen' daughters). At least his fans can relive the races Big Red did run, and Nack has the knack (sorry) of bringing them vividly back to memory. This book and \\"Wild Ride: The Rise and Tragic Fall of Calumet Farm, Inc., America's Premier Racing Dynasty\\" by Ann Hagedorn Auerbach are my two favorite reads on all aspects of the Thoroughbred racing industry in the United States. \\"Secretariat\\" reflects the brilliance of the Thoroughbred and its human interface. \\"Wild Ride\\" reflects the dark side of that same relationship.<br /><br />My only complaint regarding Nack's treatment of Secretariat is that although it starts in the right place (the birth of Somethingroyal's whopping, chestnut foal), it didn't extend much beyond Big Red's last race. I would have liked to follow him through at least part of his career at stud.<br /><br />However, that might be asking too much of a book that was published only two years after this great Thoroughbred retired from the track.<br /><br />At the beginning of the new millennium, Man O'War was voted 'Thoroughbred of the Century' by a panel that was assembled by 'Blood Horse' Magazine. But those of us who saw Secretariat win the Belmont will remember him as first, and (as they said about one of his most famous ancestors) the rest nowhere.eflects the dark side of that same relationship. <br /> <br />My only complaint regarding Nack's treatment of Secretariat is that although it starts in the right place (the birth of Somethingroyal's whopping, chestnut foal), it didn't extend much beyond Big Red's last race.

Ralph A. Lewin, professor of marine biology at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography thoroughly investigates the science, culture, and social history of coprology even down to the motto that was supposedly stamped on the British Navy's official toilet paper, i.e. \\"England expects every man to do his duty.\\"<br /><br />This book is a hoot--or maybe I should say 'a toot,' most especially the chapter on \\"Smells and Other Chemical Components, including Gases.\\"  Lewin quotes everyone from Hildegard von Bingen (ca. 1155) to President Clinton, beginning in the chapter on \\"Terminology and Cultural Attitudes\\" in which he somewhat coyly does not translate a couple of expressions in Greek and Latin.  One of the most interesting revelations in this chapter is that the Chinese don't generally make a vulgar expletive out of their term for excrement, i.e. 'da bien' which the author translates as \\"the 'big convenience' (as distinct from the more fluid 'small convenience')...\\"  Most languages, including the sign language used by chimpanzees embrace this most common example of coprolalia.<br /><br />Another interesting revelation (this book is full of them) is the French restatement of Murphy's Law:  \\"La loi d'emmerdement maximum.\\"<br /><br />The final chapter \\"Myths, Legends, and Holy Ordures\\" covers some of the supposed medical uses of feces:  \\"Hippocrates asserted that pigeon droppings were efficacious against baldness, though whether this claim was based on personal experience is not recorded.\\"  Perhaps Hippocrates was correct, since one hardly ever sees monuments to bald generals in public spaces.  This might also be the reason that some people believe it is lucky to be decorated by a bird dropping.<br /><br />Barring the first and last chapters, most of the text is devoted to the physical manifestations of feces, and the various ways that animals and humans deal with this common organic by-product.  This includes discussions of territorial markers, chamber pots, sewage, abstergents such as toilet paper and corn cobs, nutritional values, and uses for construction and decoration.<br /><br />\\"Merde\\" is short enough to read in a single evening, but you may spend the rest of your life quoting bits of it to your friends.e it is lucky to be decorated by a bird dropping. <br /> <br />Barring the first and last chapters, most of the text is devoted to the physical manifestations of feces, and the various ways that animals and humans deal with this common organic by-product.

Their usual idea of relaxation is composing scatty limericks.  Sometimes the discussion becomes more serious.  One evening, the tutor Pettigrew proposes that the passage into manhood requires a rite of initiation.  Much to his regret, the discussion turns to the American concept of 'playing chicken.'<br /><br />That night after the tutor retires to bed, six of the reading-party pile into an ancient automobile and set out on their own version of the supposed American pastime.<br /><br />You may be wondering where Sir John Appleby makes his entrance into this moody thriller.  Not until page 96, well after the undergraduate David Henchman discovers a body on the moor and is hunted, shot at, temporarily cornered in an abandoned bottle factory, and nearly run over.<br /><br />When David and Appleby return to the scene of the murder on lonely Knack Tor, they discover a body but it's not the same one David found earlier.  Someone has made a switch, and  David slowly begins to realize that he and the Metropolitan Police Commissioner are involved in a second, much deadlier game of chicken.<br /><br />The best features of this mystery-thriller-coming-of-age novel are the perilous, extended chase scene after David discovers the first body, and his interplay with Appleby whom he at first mistakes for a middle-aged London bureaucrat.<br /><br />Innes writes this sort of brave, intelligent but basically innocent undergraduate coming-of-age-under-the-threat-of-death novel so very well.  His serial detective Appleby has gotten a trifle old and cynical, but when he assumes the role of stern but witty mentor-under-fire he is at his best.<br /><br />If you enjoy the type of thriller where an undergraduate romp turns deadly, try Innes's \\"The Secret Vanguard\\" (1940), \\"A Family Affair\\" (1969), \\"The Man from the Sea\\" (1955), \\"The Journeying Boy\\" (1949), or \\"Death at the Chase\\" (1970).<br /><br />You'll smile at the antics and earnest dialogues of Innes's young men and women right before your hair starts to stand up on the back of your neck, as they accidentally intrude on murder or conspiracy most foul.

Almost 27,000 people died on the morning of  May 8, 1902 because, according to this book's author, no one had ever heard of a nu&eacute;e ardente (pyroclastic flow) until after the destruction of Saint-Pierre.<br /><br />Instead of a relatively sluggish stream of lava, a heavy ash-fall, or the earthquake plus tsunami that many were expecting (including the scientific commission appointed by the island's governor), Mount Pel&eacute;e exploded in a huge lateral blast of gas, dust, and rock.  The superheated cloud raced down the side of the volcano with the speed of a hurricane-force wind and headed directly for the port of Saint-Pierre about five miles away.<br /><br />At 8:02 A.M., May 8, 1902 a businessman in Fort-de-France (an hour's boat trip down the coast of Martinique) was talking on the telephone with a friend in Saint-Pierre.  The businessman relates that his friend \\"...had just finished his sentence, when I heard a dreadful scream, then another much weaker groan, like a stifled death rattle.\\"<br /><br />Then there was silence.  Nearly 27,000 people lay dead or dying at the other end of that telephone line, crushed by falling masonry, asphyxiated by the scalding breath of the nu&eacute;e ardente, or incinerated in the resulting inferno.  There were only two survivors in the city itself:  a shoemaker; and a prisoner in a solitary confinement cell who happened to be sheltered in the lee of a hill at the edge of the city.<br /><br />Alwyn Scarth, former Professor of Geography at the University of Dundee begins \\"La Catastrophe\\" with the founding of Saint-Pierre in 1635, and the slaughter of the indigenous Carib population.  Unfortunately, the French settlers never paused to question the original inhabitants' choice of name for the mountain that loomed on their northern horizon.  'Mountain of Fire' was renamed 'Bald Mountain,' and the colonists moved on to develop an economy built on slaves, sugarcane and rum without questioning the lack of vegetation on Mount Pel&eacute;e's summit.<br /><br />Minor eruptions occurred in 1792 and 1851, causing occasional curious picnickers to struggle up the volcano's slope for a view of the new sulphur vents (soufri&egrave;res) and hot springs.<br /><br />Memories of those harmless volcanic sputterings contributed to a false sense of security among residents of Saint-Pierre when Mount Pel&eacute;e began hurling columns of ash into the air and steaming torrents of mud down her slopes in the spring of 1902.<br /><br />When \\"La Catastrophe\\" appeared in 2002, along with other, similarly-themed books that were hastened onto the shelves (and the remainder tables) during  the centennial year of Saint-Pierre's destruction, its author separated himself from the pack by blaming the non-evacuation of the city on her residents' false sense of security, and on their ignorance of pyroclastic flows.  He thoroughly debunks the myth presented by some of his fellow-authors, that the inhabitants of Saint-Pierre were forced to stay in town because of a pending election.<br /><br />Professor Scarth has produced a meticulously-researched account of the \\"worst volcanic disaster of the 20th century.\\"  It is my favorite among the centennial publications, although I found his exposition of the history and sociology of Martinique to be a bit dry.<br /><br />Here are some of the other myths he discredits while telling the story of this catastrophe:<br /><br />* Saint-Pierre was never called 'the Paris of the West Indies'--at least not before the 1902 eruption.<br /><br />* There were more than two survivors.  Over a hundred people may have escaped alive from the August 8th nu&eacute;e ardente, although only two from the city proper.  Many of the survivors died shortly thereafter of their external burns and scalded lungs.<br /><br />* Governor Mouttet was not a villain.  He acted courageously in visiting Saint-Pierre on the eve of the eruption, and died believing that the volcano was harmless.  The real villain of this story is the man who succeeded him.  The new governor had little sympathy for his constituents, and refused to evacuate the still-inhabited villages lying closest to the volcano.  Three months after the destruction of Saint-Pierre, Mount Pel&eacute;e climaxed another period of eruption with a gigantic nu&eacute;e ardente that claimed another 1085 victims.of the eruption, and died believing that the volcano was harmless.

Even the cover story, \\"A Bottomless Grave\\" has no ghost.  However we do have Victorian witches, psychic detectives, con artists, revenge-suicides, and grave-robbers.<br /><br />There are three humorous ghost stories, which editor Hugh Lamb realizes are not to everyone's taste so he issues an advance warning: \\"I've put them all together so that those in quest of thrills alone may bypass them if they wish.\\"<br /><br />I did indeed wish.  One of them, \\"A Ghost Slayer\\" by J. Keighley Snowden is written in dialect and almost impossible to read, anyway.<br /><br />Lamb writes very detailed introductions featuring the authors, so if you have an interest in obscure Victorian writers, this book is well worth its purchase price.  And there are a handful of scary stories--some even have ghosts in them.  Here are my favorites among the twenty-one tales in this collection:<br /><br />\\"The Ship that saw a Ghost\\" by Frank Norris--A very atmospheric tale of a tramp steamer and an ancient three-masted derelict that first appears in \\"the red eye of the setting moon.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Man with the Nose\\" by Rhoda Broughton--A bride on an extended honeymoon keeps seeing a sinister figure with a prominent nose.  The story reminds me of Le Fanu's \\"Schalken the Painter.\\"  It's tough to be a bride in a ghost story--sort of like being an extra in a 'Star Trek' episode.<br /><br />\\"The Haunted Chair\\" by Richard Marsh--Members of an exclusive London club keep seeing a disreputable gambler who was supposedly exiled to Ceylon.  He also seems to be stealing their wallets.<br /><br />\\"The Story of Baelbrow\\" by E. and H. Heron--Flaxman Low, scientist and psychic detective is called into a haunted house when a housemaid is found dead in a corridor with a mysterious pustule behind her ear.  Did the family ghost suddenly discover a taste for blood?  Why is it biting folks behind their ears?	2004-08-18

As the author says in his preface, \\"This book is about an unequal contest.\\"<br /><br />The eruptions covered in this book are Stromboli (multiple), Vesuvius (AD 79), Monte Nuovo (1538), Etna (1669), Õraefaj&ouml;kull (1727), Lanzarote (1730 - 1736), Laki (1783), Coseg&uuml;ina (1835), Krakatau (1883), Mount Pel&eacute;e (1902), Par&iacute;cutin (1943), Mount St. Helens (1980), Nevado del Ruiz (1985), Lake Nyos (1986), and Pinatubo (1991).<br /><br />The most controversial inclusion in this book is the Lake Nyos carbon dioxide eruption that asphyxiated about 1,742 people.  Professor Scarth is in the minority among volcanologists in his belief that the trigger for this disaster was an eruption of carbon dioxide from the throat of the volcano beneath the lake.  Most people believe the trigger was a landslide.  If the lake bottom's carbon dioxide build-up is slow, rather than eruptive, then it can be piped to the surface and dissipated in a controlled manner. In fact, this is currently being done.  If the author is correct, there about thirty similar lakes in this region of Africa that could explode at any time--as if this continent didn't already have enough problems!<br /><br />Hardly anyone ever dies in an actual lava flow except in Hollywood.  In his conclusion, Professor Scarth categorizes the different ways to perish by volcanic eruptions, including the indirect ones--mudflows, tsunamis, fires, famines and social disruptions.  Krakatau took its biggest toll via tsunamis.  Nevado del Ruiz killed 23,000 people by melting its glacier and triggering mudslides.  Pinatubo claimed most of its casualties by combining with Typhoon Yunya to collapse roofs under a mess of drenched ash.  Laki killed its victims through the 'Haze Famine'--an acrid, blue haze of sulphur dioxide and fluorine that withered the crops and killed the farm animals.<br /><br />\\"Vulcan's Fury\\" is a good general read, and could also serve as a manual for disaster management.  Pinatubo was a much more violent eruption than Nevado del Ruiz, but its casualty list was miniscule compared to the latter because of \\"surveillance, political will, [and] evacuation of the threatened population.\\"  It is very likely that most of the 23,000 casualties in the river valleys of Nevado del Ruiz could have been averted through similar measures.glacier and triggering mudslides.

Aikman and later by R. Chetwynd-Hayes, no mean supernatural authors themselves. Some of the paperbacks in this series, which winds its way up to the \\"20th Fontana Book of Great Ghost Stories\\" are now collectors' items and worth over a hundred dollars apiece.<br /><br />R. Chetwynd-Hayes has assembled an anthology of ghost stories that are both superbly chilling and relatively unknown for this eleventh book in the series.  This editor tends to include too many humorous stories in his collections, but even the humor in this book has a ghastly twist.<br /><br />These are the stories in the 11th Fontana Book:<br /><br />\\"Justice\\" by 'The Gibsons'--A short short about the voice you may hear behind you some day.  Try not to grumble.<br /><br />\\"Aunt Cassie\\" by Virginia Swain--A tiresome old live-in aunt can't be stopped from holding conversations with her dead kinfolk.<br /><br />\\"The Woman's Ghost Story\\" by Algernon Blackwood--A ghost-hunter spends a night in a deserted house and finds it haunted by a man who died of fright.<br /><br />\\"The Ghost of U65\\" by G.A. Minto--If you enjoy this story of a haunted WWI U-Boat, check out the website madladdesigns.co.uk/unexplained/hauntings/uboat.htm for the 'true' story of U65.  There are even photographs of the jinxed submarine.<br /><br />\\"Footsteps Invisible\\" by Robert Arthur--A blind newspaper vendor learns to identify his customers by their footsteps and voices.  Then an amateur Egyptologist begs for the blind man's help in alerting him to something that has been tracking him across the face of the Earth.  Excellent story with a nasty twist at the end.<br /><br />\\"The Night-Doings at 'Deadman's'\\" by Ambrose Bierce--Thomas Hobbes once remarked that the life of man is nasty, brutish, and short.  The same could be said for the supernatural stories of Ambrose Bierce.  In this one, a man is haunted by what could be more than one ghost in the ruins of a California mining camp.<br /><br />\\"The Earlier Service\\" by Margaret Irwin--A very haunted Anglican church is the site of a young girl's horrifying First Communion.<br /><br />\\"Scots Wha Ha'E\\" by Dorothy K. Haynes--\\"Braveheart\\" fans might enjoy this story of a new subdivision haunted by the ghosts of William Wallace and his wife.<br /><br />\\"The Whittakers Ghost\\" by G.B.S.--Standard Victorian fare about a ghostly coach-and-four, plus the apparition of a monk whose appearance foretells death.<br /><br />\\"Lady Celia's Mirror\\" by Roger Malisson--A haunted mirror is bought cheaply by a pair of antiques dealers.  After a horrifying incident with the mirror, they sell it cheaply to a monastery.  But not even the monks are safe from Lady Celia.<br /><br />\\"The Lonely Inn\\" by Thomas Burke--There are many haunted inns in Great Britain, and this is one of the ghastliest.  This story makes my list of 'Top Fifty Greatest Ghost Stories.'<br /><br />\\"The Green Scarf\\" by Alfred McLelland Burrage--An artist and a writer live peacefully together in a tumbledown old mansion, until the writer discovers a secret compartment that contains a mouldering green scarf.<br /><br />\\"The House of Desolation\\" by Alan Griff--Lady Merle and her young daughter are invited to attend the sixteenth anniversary celebration of the marriage of her friend to a dabbler in the occult.  After arriving at their desolate, oddly-built mansion, Lady Merle and the other guests have trouble sorting the living from the dead.<br /><br />\\"The Man in the Mirror\\" by Sydney J. Bounds--A chess player up from London meets his ultimate opponent in a rural pub.<br /><br />\\"The Attic\\" by Pamela Vincent--A newly married couple inherit an old terrace house in London that seems to shelter half-seen shapes in its attic.<br /><br />\\"The Woman in Black\\" by Peter Hackett--A man catches the late train from Fenchurch Street station and shares his coach with a woman dressed in black.  A shocker with a neat twistat the end.<br /><br />\\"Haunted Ground\\" by Oliver la Farge--This one fooled me completely.  The man I thought was dead wasn't--at least not until after the story's end.  A young man tries to drown himself when his one true love is killed by a robber.<br /><br />\\"The Man Who Sold Ghosts\\" by Roger F. Dunkley--A traveling salesman has a rather odd product line as Lord and Lady Snood soon discover.  Funny but also horrible.<br /><br />\\"Matthew and Luke\\" by R.

The editor could never be accused of selecting shabbily-written tales for his book, but these particular stories, with one exception, are atmospheric rather than frightening<br /><br />These are the stories in the 6th Fontana Book:<br /><br />\\"Clarimonde (La Morte Amoureuse)\\" by Th&eacute;ophile Gautier--Th&eacute;ophile Gautier (1811 - 1872), a major poet, novelist, and critic of 19th-century France, was a leading exponent of art for art's sake.  This rather long tale of a priest who falls in love with a vampire is exactly that.  It certainly sets the tone for the rest of this book.<br /><br />\\"The Grey Ones\\" by J.B. Priestley--A mordant tale of an alien conspiracy and the man who discovers that his brother-in-law is probably not human.  Many of us probably have felt the same way at one time or another.<br /><br />\\"The Door in the Wall\\" by H.G. Wells--A young boy discovers a paradisiacal realm behind a door in a wall (yes, it is a green door).

This story is loaded with pathos and has a surprising twist at its end.<br /><br />\\"Priscilla and Emily Lofft\\" by George Moore--Irish author and friend of Vernon Lee (see \\"Oke of Okehurst\\" below) writes of twin sisters separated by death.  Emily returns from Priscilla's funeral but cannot get on with her own life until she determines what her sister was trying to tell her on her deathbed.<br /><br />\\"Sorworth Place\\" by Russell Kirk--This is one of conservative pundit Russell Kirk's less ravingly Catholic tales, although it involves a noble sacrifice to keep a woman from the clutches of her dead husband.<br /><br />\\"Where Their Fire is not Quenched\\" by May Sinclair--A really awful little story of a woman who is punished after death for having an affair with a married man.  Adulterers beware!<br /><br />\\"Oke of Okehurst\\" by Vernon Lee--Late Victorian feminist Vernon Lee wrote more than forty books, in a broad range of genres, including fiction, history, aesthetics, and travel literature.  \\"Oke of Okehurst\\" is one of her most collected ghost stories but it does take a rather indolent approach to its climax, which might or might not involve a phantom.<br /><br />\\"The Lips\\" by Henry S.

I'm kicking myself because I didn't immediately order the two concluding books of this trilogy as soon as I started &quot;Ship of Magic.&quot; If Patrick O'Brien had collaborated with Charles Dickens and written &quot;Oliver Twist Goes to Sea in a Magical Ship,&quot; this book might have been the outcome.<br /><br /> All of the characters are minutely detailed and believable, even the would-be pirate king, who is a much nastier man than Gilbert and Sullivan would have him. He ends up performing glorious deeds by accident, and I wouldn't be surprised if his title turns out to be 'the Great Liberator' rather than 'King' by the end of this trilogy.<br /><br /> The man who does the most evil in this book is a merchant captain who believes that he alone knows the right course to steer, both for his liveship and his family. In fact, I wonder if &quot;Billy Budd&quot; was also an inspiration for &quot;Ship of Magic.&quot; The relationships between the self-righteous captain, his unworldly son, and an evil Claggart-like second mate are almost pure Melville.

Maybe the solution will come to me in a dream.<br /><br /> Meanwhile the Forest Service comes out of this book nearly as whupped as the readers. Bowen relishes taking on any bunch that restricts the freedom of Montanans, including environmentalists in &quot;Wolf, No Wolf,&quot; Yuppie tourists in &quot;Cruzatte and Maria,&quot; and the FBI in nearly all of his Gabriel Du Pre mysteries. This time the Forest Service comes under attack for not managing its land correctly and for preventing the ranchers from bulldozing fire breaks on their own property. Smokey the Bear's green-shirts endure some pretty scatological commentary, especially after one of them tries to make Du Pre put out his cigarette.<br /><br /> It's the author who's a'growlin and a'prowlin in &quot;Ash Child.&quot;<br /><br /> Even Bowen's serial detective, Gabriel Du Pre takes a beating. In this book, he busts his appendix, gets his head dented in, is zapped by a taser, and is nearly burned alive. If you've ever fantasized about living the good life in rugged Montana, you should read all of Bowen's Du Pre mysteries before making your move. Newcomers and old hands alike die by avalanche and grizzly, by gunshot and knife, and by freezing to death in Alberta Clippers. They are burned to death in forest fires and poisoned by evil industrial magnates. It's a tough life even for a tough Metis brand inspector like Du Pre.<br /><br /> In spite of all my negative commentary, if you are already a Du Pre fan you should read &quot;Ash Child.&quot; The Big Sky Country is choked by the smoke and ash of deliberately-set forest fires as Bowen's laconic detective sets out (between stays in the hospital) to discover who murdered an old woman with a single, vicious hatchet chop. Do not let yourself be deflected by plot elaborations involving arsonists, drug dealers, and meth addicts. Concentrate on Du Pre's patient tracking of the murderer of old Maddy Collins, and you will find &quot;Ash Child&quot; to be a very satisfying read.commentary, if you are already a Du Pre fan you should read &quot;Ash Child.&quot; The Big Sky Country is choked by the smoke and ash of deliberately-set forest fires as Bowen's laconic detective sets out (between stays in the hospital) to discover who murdered an old woman with a single, vicious hatchet chop.

It doesn't matter whether you're a bankrupt rancher, a fiddler, or a member of the strange religious sect called the Host of Yahweh--they're sort of like the Amish on steroids with a bunker full of Kalashnikovs.<br /><br /> Bowen's detective-hero, Gabriel Du Pre is a laconic fiddler who lets his music and his deeds speak for him. He and his long-time mistress, Madelaine are Metis descendants of the French Voyageurs and Plains Indians.<br /><br /> Du Pre's rich friend Bart can't figure out why the bankrupt ranchers didn't come to him for help before selling their homestead to the Host of Yahweh. Then Du Pre and his FBI buddies discover that the rancher's family actually joined the secretive sect. Du Pre sneaks onto the Host of Yahweh's land to do damage to a man who is going to slaughter a band of wild horses. Then he stampedes their buffalo herd. Finally he blows up their weapons cache. In between all of these illegal goings-on, the Host of Yahweh invite all of their neighbors over for a barbecue.<br /><br /> Alas, it's a bit late to try and make friends with the very people who wish your weirdly-dressed church members had picked another state to live in. Preferably in the Netherworld.<br /><br /> &quot;Badlands&quot; is really a series of interesting, sometimes horrifying vignettes strung together in the fashion of a Montana tourist brochure, rather than a mystery with a plot.

Maybe the solution will come to me in a dream.<br /><br /> Meanwhile the Forest Service comes out of this book nearly as whupped as the readers. Bowen relishes taking on any bunch that restricts the freedom of Montanans, including environmentalists in &quot;Wolf, No Wolf,&quot; Yuppie tourists in &quot;Cruzatte and Maria,&quot; and the FBI in nearly all of his Gabriel Du Pre mysteries. This time the Forest Service comes under attack for not managing its land correctly and for preventing the ranchers from bulldozing fire breaks on their own property. Smokey the Bear's green-shirts endure some pretty scatological commentary, especially after one of them tries to make Du Pre put out his cigarette.<br /><br /> It's the author who's a'growlin and a'prowlin in &quot;Ash Child.&quot;<br /><br /> Even Bowen's serial detective, Gabriel Du Pre takes a beating. In this book, he busts his appendix, gets his head dented in, is zapped by a taser, and is nearly burned alive. If you've ever fantasized about living the good life in rugged Montana, you should read all of Bowen's Du Pre mysteries before making your move. Newcomers and old hands alike die by avalanche and grizzly, by gunshot and knife, and by freezing to death in Alberta Clippers. They are burned to death in forest fires and poisoned by evil industrial magnates. It's a tough life even for a tough Metis brand inspector like Du Pre.<br /><br /> In spite of all my negative commentary, if you are already a Du Pre fan you should read &quot;Ash Child.&quot; The Big Sky Country is choked by the smoke and ash of deliberately-set forest fires as Bowen's laconic detective sets out (between stays in the hospital) to discover who murdered an old woman with a single, vicious hatchet chop. Do not let yourself be deflected by plot elaborations involving arsonists, drug dealers, and meth addicts. Concentrate on Du Pre's patient tracking of the murderer of old Maddy Collins, and you will find &quot;Ash Child&quot; to be a very satisfying read.&quot; The Big Sky Country is choked by the smoke and ash of deliberately-set forest fires as Bowen's laconic detective sets out (between stays in the hospital) to discover who murdered an old woman with a single, vicious hatchet chop.

Aikman and later by R. Chetwynd-Hayes, no mean supernatural authors themselves. Some of the paperbacks in this series, which winds its way up to the &quot;20th Fontana Book of Great Ghost Stories&quot; are now collectors' items and worth over a hundred dollars apiece. I'm still kicking myself for not saving all of the volumes I bought while we were on an extended stay in Great Britain.<br /><br /> Each volume contains a mixture of 19th and 20th century authors--at least those who published through the late 1970s. I believe this to be the finest multi-volume set of ghost stories ever issued. The only publications that can compete with Fontana are the 36 (and counting) thrice-yearly issues of &quot;All Hallows: The Journal of the Ghost Story Society.&quot;<br /><br /> These are the stories in the 10th Fontana Book:<br /><br /> &quot;A House in the Wood&quot; by John Hastings Turner--Two friends go for a walk in the woods and find a house, inhabited by a beautiful, young woman and her parents. In the introduction, R. Chetwynd-Hayes says that most people prefer three ingredients in a collection of ghost stories: fear; pathos; and humor. I disagree with the latter two ingredients, as they dilute the first. Unfortunately, &quot;A House in the Woods&quot; is one of those stories that exudes pathos.<br /><br /> &quot;Fear&quot; by P.C. Wren--A dirty, derelict, tumble-down bungalow serves as a rest-house for travelers on route to Angkor Wat. When a visitor turns down his lantern and tries to go to sleep, he soon learns why his native bearers would not stay in the bungalow.<br /><br /> &quot;The Furnished Room&quot; by O. Henry--A young man seeking his runaway lover tracks her to a shabby furnished room on the West Side of New York. She is no longer there, but somehow he senses her presence. Not quite a ghost story, but once read it is impossible to forget. Pathos, yes, but masterfully handled.<br /><br /> &quot;To Keep Him Company&quot; by Rosemary Timperly--A boy named Tim acquires three ghostly playmates and discovers their secret only after his mother learns that she is dying.<br /><br /> &quot;In the Mist&quot; by Elizabeth Walter--A vacationing couple is lost on a misty moor. They pick up a hitch-hiker: a young man dressed in RAF-blue and heavy flying-boots who directs them to an abandoned airfield.<br /><br /> &quot;On the Brighton Road&quot; by Richard Middleton--An unpleasant little shocker about two hitch-hikers on the road to Brighton who keep meeting up with each other.<br /><br /> &quot;Smee&quot; by Ex-private-X (A. M. Burrage)--A candidate for my top-fifty greatest ghost stories list. A jolly Christmas gathering is spoiled when an extra guest keeps showing up for a game of 'hide and seek.'<br /><br /> &quot;Master Ghost and I&quot; by Barbara Softly--A disowned son returns home after five years in Oliver Cromwell's Parliamentary army. His Royalist uncle had named him as heir to an estate deep in the West Country. There is a catch. It's haunted.<br /><br /> &quot;The Moonlit Road&quot; by Ambrose Bierce--A young student is summoned home when his mother is murdered. His father then disappears from his boy's sight on a moonlit road.<br /><br /> &quot;Two Trifles&quot; by Oliver Onions--Trifles, indeed. Dated humor concerning etheric communication. There's a funnier article in &quot;New Scientist&quot; about a man who claims to have invented a technology for communicating with the dead, called 'necrophony.'<br /><br /> &quot;Wicked Captain Walshawe&quot; by Sheridan Le Fanu--A cold-hearted soldier marries a rich wife, then harries her to her grave. He even snuffs out her corpse candle before it is fully burned and is roundly cursed by his wife's mourners.<br /><br /> &quot;Monkshood Manor&quot; by L.P. Hartley--A man has the strange habit of creeping down cold, dark passageways to ensure that all of the fires have been properly banked and the gas taps turned off. His safety precautions are a source of humor among his house guests, until one of them learns of an old monkish curse.<br /><br /> &quot;The Chapel Men&quot; by A.E. Ellis--In a small Cornish village, two bitter rivals compete for the office of circuit steward. One is chosen, but drowns in a gale after someone tampers with his fishing boat. His rival perishes under mysterious circumstances shortly after the new steward's body is recovered from the sea.<br /><br /> &quot;The Birthright&quot; by Hilda Hughes--Martin's clairvoyance is strongly discouraged by his hated father. After the old man's death, Martin uses his powers to locate a missing will. However, he's in for a nasty surprise.<br /><br /> &quot;Non-paying Passengers&quot; by R. Chetwynd-Hayes--Percy Fortesque sees &quot;the face of his dead wife staring at him from a window of the five-forty-five train&quot; and decides to consult a medium. What did his deceased spouse mean when she accused him of 'being late?'o ensure that all of the fires have been properly banked and the gas taps turned off.

Some of the paperbacks in this series, which winds its way up to the &quot;20th Fontana Book of Great Ghost Stories&quot; are now collectors' items and worth over a hundred dollars apiece. I'm still kicking myself for not having saved all of the volumes I bought while we were on an extended stay in Great Britain.<br /><br /> Each book contains a mixture of the old (Victorian authors such as Amelia B. Edwards) and the 'new' (authors who published up through the 1970s). I believe this is the finest multi-volume set of ghost stories ever issued. Even the introductions are interesting. The only publications that can compete with Fontana are the 36 (and counting) thrice-yearly issues of &quot;All Hallows: The Journal of the Ghost Story Society.&quot;<br /><br /> These are the stories in the 9th Fontana Book:<br /><br /> &quot;Death Cannot Wither&quot; by Judith Merril with Algis Budrys--Edna's goatish husband Jack disappears, then returns from the dead on their wedding anniversary. Edna discovers that she prefers him in his re-formed state. Unaware of the horrid wordplay of the title, Edna becomes pregnant by her ghostly spouse.<br /><br /> &quot;The Lady's Maid's Bell&quot; by Edith Wharton--Upstairs/Downstairs and way below downstairs. A new lady's maid is haunted by her deceased predecessor.<br /><br /> &quot;Keeping His Promise&quot; by Algernon Blackwood-- This author was a pantheist and a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, eventually branching out into Buddhism and Rosicrucianism. Most of his stories reveal a deep, mystical appreciation of Nature, but &quot;Keeping His Promise&quot; is an exception to this rule. It takes place within the confines of a student's apartment near Edinburgh University. Young Marriott is studying hard for an exam when a very hungry friend shows up to remind him of a promise. One of Blackwood's best stories.<br /><br /> &quot;The Coat&quot; by A.E.D. Smith--A myopic loner is on a push-bike tour of France when a drenching rainstorm forces him to take shelter in a deserted ch?teau. He builds a fire and tries to make himself comfortable, but can't help dwelling on his discovery of drag marks that led to an old military greatcoat.<br /><br /> &quot;The Four-Fifteen Express&quot; by Amelia B. Edwards--A young man hopes to spend a genial Christmas in the English countryside with his friends, but a monogrammed cigar-case left on the train by his traveling companion puts a definite damper on his holiday. Amelia B. Edwards (1831 - 1892) is a much-anthologized writer of the supernatural, and rightfully so. One of my top fifty all-time favorite ghost stories is her ghastly &quot;The Phantom Coach.&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;Sally&quot; by Patrick Davis--A young artist drowns himself after painting a mysterious woman.<br /><br /> &quot;The Song in the House&quot; by Ann Bridge--An ancient house called Netherfield Greys has some surprises for its new owners, including an Elizabethan lady in red and her false-hearted lover.<br /><br /> &quot;The Sweeper&quot; by Ex-private-X (A. M. Burrage)--Another top-fifty candidate. A miserly old woman refuses to pay a beggar for sweeping her walk and he curses her. A. M. Burrage's (1889 - 1956) spookiest story.<br /><br /> &quot;The Glove&quot; by Roger Hicks--A man is rescued from an ice fissure in the Antarctic, but no one believes the story of how he was saved.<br /><br /> &quot;The Return of Imray&quot; by Rudyard Kipling--Kipling told ruddy good ghost stories, most of them set in India. This one is about a dog that spends her time &quot;sitting on her haunches, watching an invisible extra man as he moved about behind my shoulder.&quot; Her new owner finally discovers what grim fate befell her previous master.<br /><br /> &quot;The Liberated Tiger&quot; by R. Chetwynd-Hayes--Yet another top-fifty ghoststory, and one you're not likely to find in too many anthologies. A wife is resigned to her husband's impending death, but learns that she has a terrifying new reason for keeping him alive as long as possible.wynd-Hayes--Yet another top-fifty ghost story, and one you're not likely to find in too many anthologies.

I can't imagine Dr. Zinsser's grumpily discursive, masterfully written, and ultimately profound biography of typhus fever ever going completely out of print.<br /><br /> Stylistically the only work I can compare it to is Gibbon's &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;. Where Gibbon occasionally dipped his pen in vinegar and excoriated the Christians, Zinsser dips his pen in hydrochloric acid and savages all of the quaint human customs that have kept Typhus alive and thriving. He shows much more affectionate sympathy for the louse than he does for the General or the Politician.<br /><br /> In the interests of research, Zinsser carried pill boxes of lice under his socks for weeks at a time before taking &quot;advantage of them for scientific purposes.&quot; He is not able to tear himself away from these little creatures and address the true subject of his biography, i.e. the typhus germ, until Chapter 12!<br /><br /> However, the journey to Chapter 12 is well worth taking because along the way, Zinsser wittily savages modern biographers, psychoanalysis, astronomers and physicists who &quot;scamper back to God&quot; (Biologists evidently are much less prone to being 'born again'), and of course, all of the wars that have given Typhus countless opportunities to murder lice and humans alike.<br /><br /> &quot;Rats, Lice, and History&quot; should be required reading for would-be writers for its style, would-be Generals for its lessons on how soldiers really die, and for anyone else who is interested in a passionate, eminently witty, one-of-a-kind history of medicine. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title	2004-07-21

R. James's (MRJ's) supernatural stories. However, it only contains six of his short stories. Instead of purchasing this volume, you might want to consider one of his more complete collections. Ash-Tree Press's &quot;A Pleasing Terror&quot; (2001), contains the complete and heavily annotated supernatural writings of MRJ, and no true Monty fan should be without it.<br /><br /> The next best collection, &quot;Casting the Runes and Other Stories&quot; edited by Michael Cox, contains most of MRJ's supernatural stories and is quite a bit cheaper than &quot;A Pleasing Terror.&quot;<br /><br /> The following stories are included in &quot;A Warning to the Curious and Other Ghost Stories&quot;:<br /><br /> &quot;The Haunted Doll's House&quot;--This story was written for the library of the Queen's Doll's House, and somewhat resembles MRJ's &quot;The Mezzotint&quot; from the earlier &quot;Ghost Stories of an Antiquary.&quot; Mr. Dillet buys an unusual doll house in the Strawberry Gothic fashion from an acquaintance, and sets it up in his bedroom. &quot;It was quite six feet long, including the Chapel or Oratory...and the stable on the right.&quot; The house is completely furnished and has several inhabitants, including &quot;a gentleman and lady in blue satin and brocade, respectively...and a white haired old gentleman in a long linen night-dress and cap.&quot; When the house seems to come alive, it tells a ghastly tale of murder and revenge from beyond the grave.<br /><br /> &quot;The Uncommon Prayer-book&quot;-- Mr. Davidson strikes up a conversation with an old gentleman on a train and is invited to view a disused Chapel. MRJ engulfs his reader in quaint British dialects in this story of a prayer book that would not stay shut.<br /><br /> &quot;A Neighbour's Landmark&quot;-- A gentleman spends a wet August afternoon in his host's library and discovers an old pamphlet with two lines from a country song, &quot;That which walks in Betton Wood/ Knows why it walks or why it cries.&quot; When the weather clears, he explores the part of his friend's property that used to be called 'Betton Wood.'<br /><br /> &quot;A View from a Hill&quot;--A pair of field-glasses made by an old and rather unlikeable watch-maker reveal peculiar landscape features, including a gibbet and something hanging from it. The young man who spots the gibbet decides to pay a visit to it, even though his friend assures him that it no longer exists.<br /><br /> &quot;A Warning to the Curious&quot;--A young man discovers the hiding place of an ancient crown of East Anglia and is haunted by his finding. As in many of MRJ's stories, curiosity is severely punished.<br /><br /> &quot;An Evening's Entertainment&quot;--A rather tongue-in-cheek tale as told by MRJ through the auspices of an old grandmother, who is trying to persuade her young grandchildren to stay away from the &quot;little lane that goes up past Collin's cottage.&quot; There is a gigantic figure of a man cut into a hill next to the lane, and once the body of a young man was found hanging from an oak nearby.

Sir John Appleby can't even escape into the peaceful surroundings of his club without a fellow member bending his ear.<br />Charles Gribble usually corners Appleby and bores on about mediaeval English pottery, but this time he wants to gloat over a poetry manuscript he picked up for a song.<br />Naturally this book being what it is, the manuscript is a forgery.  In fact, it's a forgery of a forgery.  Next, a Rembrandt that might or might not be authentic floats into London and vanishes just as mysteriously as it appeared.  A collector buys what he supposes to be Toulouse-Lautrec's walking stick, as well as one of his paintings.<br />Then an antiquarian bookseller is murdered. One of the Appleby's dinner guests fails to show up.  The dealer who was asked to authenticate the Rembrandt is also killed.<br />Appleby's missing dinner guest is found at the scene of both murders, and Sir John weighs into a case from the netherworld of faked art and forgeries. While the young art appraiser who is the chief murder suspect leads Sir John on a merry chase across England, the murderer strikes again, this time much closer to the Police Commissioner's home.<br />If &quot;Silence Observed&quot; can be said to have a moral, it is be careful whom you invite to dinner.<br />One thing this book has definitely got is the most sinister old woman in all of Innes.  This author's characters are always vividly drawn, but this dweller in Rose Garden cottage reminded me of Shelob the spider in &quot;The Return of the King.&quot; When Appleby finally arrives at her dwelling, the bell pull falls limp in his hand like &quot;the limb of an infant corpse...before rigor mortis set in.&quot;<br />Innes usually doesn't resort to such melodramatic phrases, but this book is one of his combination mystery-thrillers.  It has a vigorous chase scene, a very unlikely love story, and of course Sir John in his erudite, crime-solving prime.  Do not heed his complaints about feeling elderly.

Or why the Mennonites and Amish have similar customs?  Or why an Old Order Amish kitchen might have a gas-powered refrigerator but not an electric one?<br />It's easy to distinguish the Amish farms in our area: no electrical lines running to the house; no T.V. antenna; and there are usually draft horses hitched to a piece of farm equipment or ambling through a pasture.<br />One of my questions--how did the Amish emigrate to the middle of Michigan in the latter half of the twentieth century without driving a truck or car--was answered almost immediately by this lively, interesting book:  it's okay to ride in an internal-combustion vehicle if a non-Amish ('English' they call us) is driving.<br />&quot;The Riddle of Amish Culture&quot; isn't merely a thousand-and-one-facts-about-the-Amish guide.  It is a sociological expedition into the heart of this religious order's faith and practices.  The author also delves into the history of the Anabaptists and their descendants in faith, the Mennonites and most especially the Amish.  He tells of a vigorous, albeit reclusive culture, and could almost be accused of serving as this religion's apologist if it weren't for his balanced treatment of Amish educational practices.<br />This was the most disturbing part of the book for me, as the Old Order Amish do not educate their children past eighth grade.  Nor are Amish teachers educated beyond eighth grade, and no science is taught to the children---none at all, much less Copernican astronomy or the theory of evolution.  Amish children who stay within the church never become physicians, lawyers, or other lengthily-educated professionals.<br />Luckily, the Amish have no qualms about hiring these skills from those of us the author refers to as 'Moderns.' Although there are some striking anomalies, the Amish have turned away from technological progress in the name of a peaceful, collective way of life where families and neighbors are bound together from cradle to grave.  No computers.  No central heating.  No power lawn mowers.<br />However, according to the Amish themselves, &quot;the bottom line shows that they are subsidizers, rather than parasites, of the larger economic system.&quot;  They pay taxes but refuse government handouts like Social Security or farm subsidies.<br />Heck, they even pay school taxes even though their own children do not attend public schools.<br />This book omitted one topic that seemed appropriate for a sociological text:  I would have been interested in the author's treatment of the challenge facing the Amish regarding intermarriage within a relatively small gene pool.

Its owner, Squire Grinton hates books and there is an unspoken understanding that his library is off-limits to his guests.<br />Honeybath is poking about Grinton, searching for a background against which to paint the squire.  He has decided to paint Terence Grinton in his hunting pinks, but has also made it clear that adding a horse to the portrait would be very expensive.  &quot;With a favourite groom thrown in it would be classifiable as a conversation piece, and so cost the earth.&quot;  It is at this point in the decision-making process (no groom no horse) that Honeybath, member of the Royal Academy and portrait painter to Peers of the Realm wanders into the forbidden library.<br />Naturally he finds a dead body.  Most especially Honeybath notes its expression of malign glee.  He locks up the library and returns with his friend, Sir John Appleby.<br />The body is gone and there is a smell of toasted cheese wafting through the stale air of the library.<br />Corpses don't scamper off, not even in Michael Innes's most surreal novels and &quot;Honeybath and Appleby&quot; is just a pleasant locked-room mystery with a manor house full of eccentric suspects, including its book-hating squire.  There is also an autodidactic butler, a shady son-in-law, various antique professors, a long-lost satire from the pen of Alexander Pope, and a phony medium who goes about clasping her bosom and proclaiming, &quot;Woe to profane inquirers into forbidden things.&quot;<br />Indeed.

Since one of my entomological challenges is distinguishing damselflies from their generally larger and faster-flying odonate cousins, it would have been nice to have both in one book.<br />Whining aside, &quot;Dragonflies through Binoculars&quot; contains a good, well-organized collection of photographs and descriptions of living dragonflies, with 47 plates in full color, plus information on all 307 species found in North America.  These ancient insects are enameled in heraldic designs of stripes, checks, and diagonals as though they were about to fly off to an aerial jousting match---which is probably just what they will do as soon as you have your binoculars trained on them.  I even saw one dragonfly with a miniature death's-head emblazoned on its thorax.<br />If you think I'm the only romantic concerning these fascinating Paleozoic-era hunters, tell me why they have been christened with such outlandish names as 'Ebony Boghaunter' or 'Stygian Shadowdragon.'<br />This book is more concerned with the current ecology of the dragonfly, rather than its 300-million year history.  The author also gives advice such as what kind of binoculars to purchase, which clubs or societies to join, and how to photograph these elusive darters in their natural surroundings---there are no hints of kill bottles in this book!<br />Buy a copy of this book and see if dragonfly watching doesn't become your newest, most enjoyable hobby.	2004-07-11

Its popularity is well-deserved.  Author and photographer, Harry C. Lund has spent many years hiking through bogs, forests, meadows, and sand dunes in Michigan's Upper and Lower Peninsulas and its off-shore islands in order to put together this book for us.  I have yet to find a Michigan wild flower that isn't listed in this guide.  The book is well-bound and would easily fit into your backpack for a walk through the wild.<br />The flower photographs are grouped by color for ease of location.  They are then listed in the order in which they appear during the growing season, which is a little trickier to use.  I basically start at the beginning of a color group and page through until I find the flower I'm trying to identify.  There are generally six photographs to a page, with the text on the facing page.  In some cases, the photographs are a bit too small to easily recognize the flower, but when combined with the text there should be no identification problem.<br />At the beginning of &quot;Michigan Wildflowers in Color,&quot; the author has illustrated textual terms such as 'stipules' or 'basal leaves' with a collection of line drawings.  The plant descriptions include location, seasonal display, height, and information on whether the flower is protected and should not be picked or moved.<br />There is a quiz at the back of the book to test your 'flower power.'  There is also an 'Observer's List' to keep track of the flowers you do find.  Unfortunately, the first entry I wanted to check off wasn't on the list!  Perhaps this is because Crown Vetch is not really a wild flower, although its photograph and description appear in the main section of this book.<br />The author has also mapped out eight wildflower trails in various Michigan habitats, plus the seasonal species of flowers that can be found there.<br />In total, &quot;Michigan Wildflowers in Color&quot; is a very helpful guide, especially when used in combination with a book like the Peterson &quot;Field Guide to Wildflowers&quot; where the drawings might serve as a confirmation or a backup to Lund's photographs.  Leaves in particular are easier to identify through Peterson's drawings.helpful guide, especially when used in combination with a book like the Peterson &quot;Field Guide to Wildflowers&quot; where the drawings might serve as a confirmation or a backup to Lund's photographs.

Reed,' 'she' could be a sweet-handling lady or a cranky individualist with a tendency to sink at the slightest provocation.<br />One of my favorite Dwight Boyer stories in this book concerns a cantankerous whaleback named 'Henry Cort.'  For twenty-five years she was a steady worker making the long haul from the upper lakes to Ohio and back, her holds full of ore and grain.  But increasingly larger carriers took over the long hauls and 'Henry Cort' was reduced to &quot;carrying pig iron, scrap, slag and heaven-knows-what, always ending up in some evil-smelling backwater dock wreathed in the noxious fumes of foundry furnaces.&quot;<br />Naturally she revolted.  When she was asked to function as an ice-breaker for the larger, more modern ships, 'Henry Cort' disobligingly sank and took her winter's rest under the waters of Lake Erie.  She was raised the next season and resumed her career as a short-hauler.  She drove hard onto a reef and sank.<br />According to Admiral Grace Hopper, &quot;a ship in port is safe...&quot; but not this old whaleback.  She was raised and worked for five more years, then sank with her bow tied to a Detroit dock!<br />Pumped out and patched, she dashed against a Muskegon breakwater, 3000 feet from shore during a furious gale and down she went.  Even her faithful engineer, who had stayed with her through three sinkings gave up with her this time:  &quot;To hell with 'er!&quot; he is reported to have said, as he scrambled up the icy rocks of the breakwater.<br />&quot;Strange Adventures of the Great Lakes&quot; may not be Boyer's best book (my favorite is &quot;Ghost Ships of the Great Lakes&quot;) but he spins vivid tales of fresh-water ships like the 'Cort' and of the eccentric, heroic crews who sometimes came ashore without them.sh-water ships like the 'Cort' and of the eccentric, heroic crews who sometimes came ashore without them.	2004-07-09

This is a cheerful 245-page guide from the same folks who gave us publications such as &quot;Canoeing Michigan Rivers&quot; and &quot;A Guide to 199 Michigan Waterfalls.&quot;  It is designed to assist birdwatchers, cross-country skiers, hikers, campers and other nature lovers in their search for Michigan's flora and fauna, or a quiet place to picnic.  The book is a little too large for your glove compartment, but you'll still want to store a copy in your car for those weekend outings, or for an hour's walk in green and peaceful surroundings.<br />&quot;Natural Michigan&quot; doesn't list state or national parks (see author's &quot;Michigan State and National Parks: A Complete Guide&quot;), just the smaller Michigan beauty spots that might go undiscovered by all but the nearest residents.  It includes nature centers, sanctuaries, game areas, arboretums, and even a wastewater treatment area.  Both the Upper and Lower Peninsulas are covered.<br />Each of the 228 attractions is described in terms of its most unique or eye-catching features such as this depiction of the St. Clair Woods Nature Sanctuary near Port Huron:  &quot;The area also hosts ferns, shrubs, and wildflowers, including three different types of trilliums...&quot;  I've lived in Michigan all of my life and only knew of two types of trilliums.  If these spring flowers happen to be your favorites, also check out the Trillium Trail Nature Preserve near Memphis, or the Trillium Ravine Plant Preserve near Niles.<br />If you prefer a dollop of history along with the wonders of nature, try the Besser Natural Area near Alpena:  &quot;Nearly a mile of wild, undeveloped Lake Huron shoreline, a ghost town, [and] a sunken ship in a small lagoon...are attractions to this 137-acre preserve.&quot;<br />A map, directions, fees (if any), schedule, and prominent feature symbols are included with each area's description.  The only omission that might have proved useful is a cross-reference by prominent feature, such as ski trails.trails.	2004-07-08

And it's really about Michigan climate and Michigan soils.  Someone didn't just go through and change, say 'Iowa' to 'Michigan' with a word processor, then rename the book.<br />The authors make a point of informing the reader which perennials are native to Michigan--another bonus.  The best varieties for a particular garden are also described, e.g. the 'Gardenview Scarlet' variety of Bergamot resists powdery mildew more effectively than some of its relatives.<br />The book begins with a pictorial guide called &quot;The Flowers at a Glance&quot; where photographs of the perennials are listed in alphabetical order, by common name.  There is a no-nonsense introduction to suitable perennials for the Michigan climate and its USDA hardiness zones.  The zone map is more detailed than usual, which is useful for me because I've lived in my new location for less than a year, and the map tells me I need to select perennials that will survive at -20 F.  In my former location, temperatures rarely dropped below -5 F.<br />The next few sections explain how to start, maintain, and propagate a perennial garden.  The authors detail which plants can be started from stem, root, and basal cuttings and which can be started from rhizomes.  There is the obligatory chapter on 'Problems &amp; Pests' before we plunge into the heart of this book:  the alphabetically-arranged sections on each of the 681 selected perennials.<br />Each species is described, including origin and bloom time, and whether (thank you! thank you!) deer find it hard to digest.  Each has subsections on 'Planting' (how and when to start your plants), 'Growing,' 'Tips,' 'Recommended' varieties, and 'Problems and Pests.'  Colored photographs, usually labeled by variety, accompany the descriptions of each perennial.<br />Lone Pine Publishing, you've put together an excellent, well-organized book for Michigan gardeners (even if you are located in Edmonton, Canada).

He also takes in the Viscount Saul, the Earl of Kildonan's heir, who is a youth of rather morbid disposition.  As the story opens, the orphaned Frank is dying of what appears to be brain fever, brought on by a great fright.  Lord Saul is overtaken by a fit of laughter when he hears that Frank is dying.  However, he does not laugh for long.  Many years after the sudden deaths of Frank and Lord Saul, a new family takes residence in the prebendal house at Whitminster.  Miss Oldys, niece to the family, discovers a scrying glass that once belonged to the sinister Viscount Saul.<br />&quot;The Diary of Mr Poynter&quot;--A book collector finds a sample of fabric in an old diary and decides to have it reproduced as curtains for his bedroom.<br />&quot;An Episode of Cathedral History&quot;--Mr. Lake is deputed to examine the archives of the Cathedral of Southminster, and is curious to see what the ancient building looks like at night.  He hears the tale of a rather plain altar-tomb and what transpired when a Victorian Dean attempted to move it.<br />&quot;The Story of a Disappearance and an Appearance&quot;--This is the only one of MRJ's stories that was specifically set over the Christmas holiday, even though he wrote many of his stories to be read at Christmas.  The sudden, mysterious disappearance of his uncle forces a young man to cancel his previous holiday engagements and join the search that is in progress for his relative, who was a rather unlikeable rector.  This story features a rather grisly Punch and Judy show, and an equally horrible Christmas service in the Rector's former church.<br />&quot;Two Doctors&quot;--Dr. Abell and Dr. Quinn (think 'Abel and Cain') both live and practice in the same parish.  Dr. Abell appears to be a dabbler in the supernatural, and blames Dr. Quinn for the loss of his patients.  Dr. Quinn begins to have horrible nightmares about a man who is struggling to break free of a chrysalis.

James (MRJ) are widely considered to be the best supernatural literature ever written.  &quot;Ghost Stories of an Antiquary, Part 2: More Ghost Stories&quot; was his second collection of short stories to be published (1911) and includes seven tales of the supernatural.<br />However, you might want to spend a bit more money and buy the &quot;The Penguin Complete Ghost Stories of M.R. James.&quot;  If you completely succumb to the refined but potent horror of this author's writings, only &quot;A Pleasing Terror&quot; (Ash Tree Press 2001) will then do.  The latter book contains all of MRJ's supernatural literature, including story fragments that were never completed, biographies, bibliographies, commentary, and his fantasy novelette, &quot;The Five Jars.&quot;<br />'More Ghost Stories' consists of the following stories, plus a brief preface by the author:<br />&quot;A School Story&quot;--MRJ was a dean at King's College, Cambridge and he supposedly wrote this story to entertain the King's College Choir.  I believe it is one of his shortest complete stories and it contains several ideas for further tales of the supernatural which were never followed up by MRJ himself.  In this tale two middle-aged men are reminiscing about ghosts at boys' schools, and one relates a story of a schoolboy's revenge on a murderous master.<br />&quot;The Rose Garden&quot;--Features one of MRJ's less sympathetic female characters.  The overbearing Mrs. Anstruther gets her supernatural comeuppance when she insists upon the removal of an old oak post in the rose garden.<br />&quot;The Tractate Middoth&quot;--The young Mr. Garrett is asked to find a copy of the &quot;Tractate Middoth&quot; in a &quot;certain famous library&quot; and stumbles upon a cobwebby mystery.  Find yourself a quiet, unpopulated corner in the stacks of an old library and see if you can read this story without looking behind you.  This is MRJ at his antiquarian best.<br />&quot;Casting the Runes&quot;--One of MRJ's most collected stories along with &quot;Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You, My Lad.&quot;  The villain of tale is sometimes assumed to be based on the self-styled 'Great Beast,' occultist Aleister Crowley.  He and MRJ might have crossed paths at Cambridge University although there seems to be no proof that the scholarly Dean ever met the so-called 'wickedest man in the world.'  At any rate, this is a tale of a man who unwittingly angers a sorcerer.<br />&quot;The Stalls of Barchester Cathedral&quot;--This story begins with the obituary of the Venerable John Benwell Haynes, Archdeacon of Sowerbridge and Rector of Pickhill and Candley.  He succeeded to his position upon the rather mysterious demise of Archdeacon Pulteney in 1810, but does not find much enjoyment in his new job.

The tale of its haunting is told primarily through a court record from the time of Lord Chief Justice Jeffreys, he of the infamous 'Bloody Assize' that followed the Monmouth Rebellion.  In spite of this rather awkward structure, it is a very frightening tale of supernatural revenge.<br />&quot;Mr Humphreys and His Inheritance&quot;--Once installed as the new master of his deceased uncle's estate, Mr. Humphreys discovers the plan to an overgrown maze on his property.  He decides to investigate the old landscaping feature, which was erected by one of his most notorious ancestors.  Mr. Humphreys also discovers a set of stone blocks that were once part of the maze.

Horror is the 'oh yuk, how can these hideous events be happening' reaction.  Terror is knowing that in the darkness, if you reach for the light switch, something will realize exactly where you are.<br />That said, this novel is hard to put down.  It has likeable, interesting characters and an evil vampyr named Isabella, who has understandable motives for murder.  Bentley Little's finest descriptions are reserved for her vengeful killings.  The story jolts forward with death after gruesome death, but the reader finally catches on to the reason for the murders and the walking zombies, without too much prodding from Bentley Little.  It's always a pleasure to deduce whodunit and why without a flat-out, often tedious explanation from the author.<br />This novel's main protagonist, a nice-guy private detective named Miles Huerdeen is asked to investigate the mysterious stalking of an old man.  Another one of his cases ends abruptly when his client is torn in half, lengthwise.  Old men are dying horrible deaths all around him.  Then his own father dies, walks out of the morgue and disappears.<br />Several hellish visions and deaths later, Miles realizes that a monster is waiting for him in the depths of Wolf Canyon, where a village of witches had been deliberately drowned by a government hydroelectric dam.<br />&quot;The Walking&quot; isn't the scariest or most gruesome horror novel I've ever read--go to Stephen King for those superlatives--but it is clever, non-stop reading.	2004-07-04

You must read it.	Before signing the consent forms for my lumpectomy, I asked my surgeon if there was a possibility that I might wake up from my operation without a breast.  &quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;we don't do that any longer.&quot;<br />Ah, but they used to.  In fact, according to &quot;The Breast Cancer Wars&quot; it was standard procedure during most of the twentieth century for a woman to go under the knife for a biopsy and wake up without her breast, axillary nodes, and her chest wall muscles.  If she were unlucky enough to be operated on in the fifties, she might also be minus an arm and part of her rib cage.<br />Chapter 4, &quot;The Scalpel Triumphant:  Radical Surgery in the 1950s&quot; is truly grotesque to someone who had her own surgery in December, 2001.  One surgeon of that middle decade even accused a colleague of &quot;having performed a 'humanectomy.'&quot;  People who went in to the operating room with breast cancer might lose a whole forequarter (clavicle, scapula, and an arm).  For reproductive cancers, there was an operation called the hemipelvectomy, &quot;which required removal of the 'hind-quarter': a leg and an adjacent bone from the pelvis.&quot;  A surgeon named Pack performed over 200 hemipelvectomies on men and women, acquiring the nickname 'Pack the Knife' from his admiring colleagues.<br />How did the war against cancer come to involve such radical surgeries?  According to the author, surgeons gained experience with extreme operations during World War II, where they also learned about the life-saving qualities of blood transfusions and penicillin:  &quot;Indeed, the Surgeon General had reported a remarkable 96 percent survival rate among injured World War II military personnel.&quot;<br />When the surgeons returned from the battlefields, they were prepared to take extreme measures against an enemy more ancient than the Nazis.  Cancer researcher Michael Shimkin later noted, &quot;'surgeons went radical and then superrradical' during the decade following World War II.&quot;<br />I started reading this book fully prepared to despise William Halsted, the surgeon who invented the radical mastectomy and performed it first in 1882.  However that was not to be the case.  Halstead was a great surgeon and &quot;believed that his operation, if performed early enough in the course of the disease, could substantially prolong the survival of patients&quot;--as did generations of surgeons following his training and example, even though 75% of their patients were dead five years after surgery.<br />Even after statistics like the above, randomized controlled trials involving lumpectomies and follow-up radiation, womens' activism, better mammography, and a new theory on how breast cancer metastasized, older surgeons performed radical and modified radical mastectomies well into the 1980s--a century after Halstead performed his first.

However that was not to be the case.  Halstead was a great surgeon and &quot;believed that his operation, if performed early enough in the course of the disease, could substantially prolong the survival of patients&quot;--as did generations of surgeons following his training and example, even though 75% of their patients were dead five years after surgery.<br />Even after statistics like the above, randomized controlled trials involving lumpectomies and follow-up radiation, womens' activism, better mammography, and a new theory on how breast cancer metastasized, older surgeons performed radical and modified radical mastectomies well into the 1980s--a century after Halstead performed his first.

The biggest flaw of this book should be mentioned right away:  it has no color illustrations except on the cover.  There are rather small black-and-white drawings and descriptions of an insect's range of colors, but for an interested amateur like me ninety percent of a bug's identification is its color.<br />On the other hand, the author quickly taught me how to tell the difference between a damselfly and a dragonfly (size and the way they hold their wings at rest).  I also learned that most of the moths banging against the screens at night are cutworm moths.  I'm probably doing the local farmers a favor by luring them to my window.<br />The book is stuffed with interesting facts but because of its size (324 pages) it must necessarily go lightly over the ground for each family of insects.  For instance ants (Family Formicidae) are disposed of in two pages, and I'm still without a clue as to the species of tiny red ants that seem to sneak into the house around the window frames.<br />&quot;Insects of the Great Lakes Region&quot; is divided into five chapters, plus glossary, appendices, bibliography, and a heavily Latin, sometimes confusing index.  Antlions are listed by their English name, but not ants.  Fireflies are listed as lightningbugs in the index, but as 'Firefly Beetles' in the header to the text.<br />Chapter 1 is a 'geological and biological history of the Great Lakes Region.'  Chapter 2 covers this region's entomological history, and Chapter 3, the distributional patterns of its insects.<br />Perhaps to make up for this book's lack of color, Chapter 4 teaches the principles of insect classification.  Look for distinctive shapes such as a thrip's fringed wings, or unique body appendages such as pincers.  Does the insect sting you or chew holes in your clothes?  Does it reach through the screen with its nasty little proboscis and try to suck your blood?<br />Chapter 5, &quot;Insect Fauna of the Great Lakes Region&quot; comprises the major portion of the book.  This is where the reader can browse through some fascinating natural histories.  Although the tenor of this review might seem anti-insect, there are some wondrous six-legged Arthropoda in this region--even a species of mosquito that spends its larval stage in the bog pitcher, and somehow manages to avoid being digested by this unique, carnivorous plant.<br />The appendices guide the reader to entomological organizations, periodicals, insect collections, collecting regulations, as well as indicating which insects are endangered or threatened.ook.

Dan Asfar, author of &quot;Ghost Stories of Michigan&quot; retells stories previously published by Reverend Gerald S. Hunter, Frederic Stonehouse, and Marion Kuclo and gratefully mentions these authors in his 'Acknowledgments.'<br />Edward George Earl Bulwer-Lytton, himself an author of horror stories may also have had an influence on this author, or so I'm guessing from sentences like:  &quot;The Dwarf was giggling uncontrollably as bubbling tendrils of drool dripped from the rancid leer on its face.&quot;  If that had been the lead sentence to Asfar's story &quot;The Red Dwarf,&quot; I think it would have been a strong contestant for the annual Bulwer-Lytton Fiction award.<br />The jolliest section of this book, &quot;Michigan Ghost Hunters&quot; relates the adventures of intrepid groups such as the West Michigan Ghost Hunters Society.  Many of these stories involve nocturnal trips to graveyards, where the participants have armed themselves with digital cameras that later reveal &quot;orbs, ectoplasmic mists all over the photographs.&quot;  Usually the ghost-hunters remember sensing &quot;threatening feelings&quot; or an &quot;imminent sense of doom&quot; in the areas where their film later revealed the shining, multi-colored spheres.  Each of these ghost hunting societies has a web site listed in this book where you can view the results of their supernatural research.<br />Graveyards are not the only sites that have been explored by the ghost hunters.  Some of the author's most interesting prose involves the history of places such as Eloise Mental Asylum or the Bath Consolidated School.  The latter building was dynamited by its janitor on May 18, 1927--one of the worst mass murders in this state.  Private houses, hotels, bars, and a theatre also come in for their share of mysterious occurrences.<br />If you enjoy the stories in this book, its author has also hacked out--excuse me--published &quot;Ghost Stories of the Civil War,&quot; &quot;Ghost Stories of America,&quot; &quot;Ghost Stories of Pennsylvania,&quot; and &quot;Ghost Stories of the Old West.&quot;out--excuse me--published &quot;Ghost Stories of the Civil War,&quot; &quot;Ghost Stories of America,&quot; &quot;Ghost Stories of Pennsylvania,&quot; and &quot;Ghost Stories of the Old West.&quot;	2004-06-26

Horror is the 'oh yuk, how can these hideous events be happening' reaction.  Terror is knowing that in the darkness, if you reach for the light switch, something will realize exactly where you are.<br />That said, this novel is hard to put down.  It has likeable, interesting characters and an evil vampyr named Isabella, who has understandable motives for murder.  Bentley Little's finest descriptions are reserved for her vengeful killings.  The story jolts forward with death after gruesome death, but the reader finally catches on to the reason for the murders and the walking zombies, without too much prodding from Bentley Little.  It's always a pleasure to deduce whodunit and why without a flat-out, often tedious explanation from the author.<br />This novel's main protagonist, a nice-guy private detective named Miles Huerdeen is asked to investigate the mysterious stalking of an old man.  Another one of his cases ends abruptly when his client is torn in half, lengthwise.  Old men are dying horrible deaths all around him.  Then his own father dies, walks out of the morgue and disappears.<br />Several hellish visions and deaths later, Miles realizes that a monster is waiting for him in the depths of Wolf Canyon, where a village of witches had been deliberately drowned by a government hydroelectric dam.<br />&quot;The Walking&quot; isn't the scariest or most gruesome horror novel I've ever read--go to Stephen King for those superlatives--but it is clever, non-stop reading.	2004-06-25

Most of 378 pages are taken up by descriptions of the 75 species of reptiles and amphibians that might be encountered by those of us who live near one of the Great Lakes.  The color photographs and distribution maps are well-suited for species identification.  I was able to recognize a pair of snakes that rove through a swampy area near our driveway as Northern Ribbon Snakes (Thamnophis sauritus septentrionalis), a handsome species of garter snake.  The frogs that are currently hopping through the lawn are Wood Frogs (Rana sylvatica), not a brown variation of Leopard Frog (Rana pipiens), as I had originally thought.<br />Each of the species narratives is divided into the following sections:  &quot;Description;&quot; &quot;Confusing Species;&quot; &quot;Distribution and Status;&quot; &quot;Habitat and Ecology;&quot; &quot;Reproduction and Growth;&quot; and &quot;Conservation.&quot;  The author stresses 'nonconsumptive' observation of these interesting creatures in their habitat, since many of the species are in decline.  Newts seem to be especially vulnerable to degradation of their habitat and the author suggests conserving and protecting them by &quot;creating ponds that are close to woodland habitats.&quot;  I've lived in Michigan all of my live and have never seen any form of salamander, including newts, so I'll have to start looking more closely in and near the local woodland ponds.  They are not for picking up, though.  The author states that all members of the Salamandridae family have skins that &quot;are well supplied with poison glands that help discourage predators.&quot;<br />&quot;Amphibians and Reptiles of the Great Lakes Region&quot; is a well-organized, well-written, and well-illustrated guide for all budding herpetologists or for those of us in the region who are curious about our natural surroundings.nds that help discourage predators.&quot;<br />&quot;Amphibians and Reptiles of the Great Lakes Region&quot; is a well-organized, well-written, and well-illustrated guide for all budding herpetologists or for those of us in the region who are curious about our natural surroundings.	2004-06-23

For one thing, he is no longer officially a policeman.  Colonel Tommy Pride is the local Chief Constable, and Appleby isn't sure whether he likes him.  When he comes face-to-face with Colonel Pride at a church fête on Allington's estate, they bristle at each other distrustfully.<br />Then Appleby realizes that Colonel Pride is practically his double.  They are both elderly men with a military bearing.  Both are wearing tweeds and almost identical green trilbys.  In fact:  &quot;If he and Pride...were to hunch themselves down on each side of a fireplace, the effect would be... that of ...twinned china dogs...&quot;<br />In later novels, Sir John and Colonel Pride become good friends (see &quot;Appleby's Other Story&quot; (1974)), but in &quot;Death by Water&quot; (1968) they are still wary of each other.  Nevertheless, Pride supplies the police power necessary to tow a car and corpse out of their host's ornamental pond, and supplies Appleby with the information he needs to solve a series of mysterious deaths.<br />One might refer to Colonel Pride as Appleby's Lestrade, even to a bit of bumbling on the Chief Constable's part.<br />Michael Innes combines many themes that he has used in other Appleby mysteries:  buried treasure; mysterious scientists; eccentric rectors; feuding relatives; and just a touch of spy story.  Intellectual arrogance, as in many of Innes's novels is the villain's Achilles' heel.<br />Never, I warn you, never invite Sir John to dinner, to a church fête, or to your sound-and-light show on the castle parapet if murder is to follow.<br />Michael Innes (John Innes Mackintosh Stewart) was born in Edinburgh, educated at Oxford, and taught English in universities all over the world. His scholarly career includes works on Rudyard Kipling and Thomas Hardy, but he is better known as the creator of Inspector John Appleby, whose exploits inspired a lasting vogue for literary (and literate) mysteries.

His young men are uniformly intelligent (one might even say intellectually arrogant), intrepid, and high-spirited.  They tend to actively seek adventure rather than waiting for adventure to stumble over them.<br />Dick Cranston was playing hide-and-seek on a midnight beach with his lover, Lady Blair, when a naked man walked out of the sea.  Shortly thereafter, someone starts shooting at him.  Cranston makes a split second decision to help the man escape from his would-be-murderers.  He doesn't know that his decision will involve him in a long, at times terrifying journey from the coast of Scotland to London.  He soon learns that the man from the sea is a British nuclear physicist who had defected to the Soviet Union at the beginning of the Cold War, and who now has his own reasons for returning home.<br />This Cold War melodrama has a bit of anti-communist rhetoric, although not nearly as much Evil Empire stuff as other mystery novelists who were writing at the same time, e.g. Rex Stout.  Innes is more interested in the complex character of the man from the sea, who betrayed his country for what might seem like trivial reasons to us, and who might be planning to betray her again.  We don't find out until the end of the book why the man from the sea returned to England.<br />Meanwhile there's a rousing chase across the quarries, beaches, and heath of Scotland wherein Dick Cranston falls out of love twice and into love for a third and probably last time.<br />Love, suspense, and the searing breath of danger envelope us as we follow Cranston and the man from the sea to their final, surprising destination.	2004-06-21

There are five narrators in all, each with his own distinctive voice.  There are also several solutions to the murder, and Innes makes each solution seem like the correct one when presented by one of the narrators.  I think this is his most rigorous and plausible mystery---well, except for the intrusion of the messenger rats---this author cannot resist a slight touch of the surreal.<br />The Laird of Erchany, Ranald Guthrie has two outstanding traits:  his miserliness, which is causing his castle to fall down around his ears; and his fear of death:  he chants &quot;Lament for a Maker&quot; through his rat-infested halls, and the villagers of Kinkeig quite rightly think him mad. He is served by the Hardcastles, a seedy old couple, and Tammas, a brain-damaged boy.  Even as Ranald Guthrie might remind you of an evil Prospero, and his niece Christine of Miranda, Tammas will make you think of Caliban.<br />Two guests are stranded at Erchany on Christmas Eve by a snow storm, and one of them just happens to be the Laird of Erchany's American heir.  When Tammas struggles through the snow drifts and into the village of Kinkeig on Christmas morning, the early kirk-goers are interrupted by cries of murder most foul.<br />Inspector Appleby, a solicitor, a cobbler, a physician, and the Laird of Erchany's unwanted guests must work together to prevent more lives from being destroyed by a plot that seethes in fratricide, incest, and a centuries-old clan feud.event more lives from being destroyed by a plot that seethes in fratricide, incest, and a centuries-old clan feud.	2004-06-21

This novel is basically a British comedy of manners, thinly disguised as a whodunit.  It is narrated in the first person by Arthur, one of the suspects who happens to be a writer:<br />The aristocratic Arthur and his relatives gather for the Christmas holiday at Belrive Priory, the ancient family seat in the north of England.  Much to their dismay, they learn that the current owner of Belrive, Arthur's cousin Basil, is planning to sell his estate to a brewer.<br />Basil, the seventh Baronet of Belrive Priory, needs the money to fund an expedition to the Arctic.<br />When Basil's nephew Wilfred is shot, every one wonders whether Basil had been the real target---and whether there would be a second, fatal attempt on the seventh Baronet's life.<br />Inspector John Appleby happens to be a guest at dinner on the night of the shooting.  The local constable is only too happy to turn the crime over to the young CID inspector, and so Appleby enters the fray with Arthur serving as his Watson and family historian.<br />Michael Innes (pseudonym for John Innes Mackintosh Stewart) has out-Agatha'd Christie in this early Appleby.  Each character is suspected in turn, and each has a plausible motive and opportunity.  The story's climax is very typical Christie, wherein all of the suspects gather in the drawing room, and each explains his or her version of the `night of terror.'  There are a couple of false confessions, and finally Appleby explains ALL.<br />The mystery itself is very complex, and the solution rather contrived.  Read &quot;Comedy of Terrors&quot; for its highly literate prose--Appleby solves the mystery only after he recalls a verse from \\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" (hence the book's alternate title)--and for its in-depth characterizations.	2004-06-21

I would hate to think that any of these particular criminals are free to kill again.  Ann Rule has selected gruesome cases to include in &quot;A Rage to Kill.&quot;<br />Fortunately a few of the most vicious killers did not survive their capture.  Unfortunately one of them was never identified, and some of the stories have had to have their body count revised upward.<br />Ann Rule, a former policewoman writes about the victims with a compassion that sometimes ventures over the border into clich&eacute;.  Many are described as stunningly beautiful, innocent, soft-spoken, harmless, well-loved, kindhearted creatures who would certainly have qualified for sainthood if their lives had not been cut tragically short.<br />The killers are more interesting, as in that old Vaudevillian clich&eacute;, &quot;the snake has all the lines.&quot;  A transvestite prostitute stabs his customer to death when the john discovers his true sex.  A prison official must decide whether this particular killer should be incarcerated with other men or put in a prison for women.  Spree killer Chris Wilder drives one of his victims cross-country, then puts her on a plane back to California instead of murdering her.<br />Rule's homicide detectives are all a heroic blend of hard work, perseverance, and courage.  They do not stand out as individuals as they would if say, Joseph Wambaugh had written this book.  I will remember the murderers in &quot;A Rage to Kill&quot; much longer than the bland policemen or the saintly victims, because they are the characters upon which Rule lavishes her most original prose.<br />Most of these cases took place in the Seattle area, and only one that I know of has received extensive, nation-wide media attention.  True-crime aficionados will appreciate Ann Rule's meticulous attention to detail, and the extensive contacts with law enforcement officials that give her a unique perspective into each of these ten stories.enforcement officials that give her a unique perspective into each of these ten stories.	2004-06-19

Twinned, they seem incompatible.  One theme is concerned with the horrors of World War I trench warfare.  The other is more classical horror, involving generations of child murders and black magic.<br />Jonathan Aycliffe is my favorite living writer of the supernatural, and this book has some very spooky moments.  A Van Helsing-type character tries to exorcise evil from a girl who may or may not be alive.  Later she does or does not die, and is buried.  Mostly the classically-themed horror is muted rather than straightforward:  footprints begin and end in the snow of an abandoned garden; swans refuse to return to a manor's lake; a child is terrified in Cripplesease Woods and &quot;never stopped looking over his shoulder when there was nothing to be seen.&quot;<br />The horror of trench warfare is treated in a more straightforward manner by Aycliffe:  a man's legs are blown off; another soldier loses half of his face; mustard gas cripples a third.  Meanwhile a hunchback makes ammunition for the war in a poisonous shot tower on the estate of Trevelyan Priors in Cornwall.  Children who are drawn to the tower disappear or fall mysteriously ill.<br />Trevelyan Priors becomes the new home for fifteen-year-old Simon Lysaght after the death of his father in France.  The Trevelyans have lost one son in the war, and another returns home incurably crippled.  Simon is barely through the door of his new home when a maid commits suicide by throwing herself out of a window.  He doesn't know it, but her death is a portent of what the rest of his stay is going to be like.<br />People drown, disappear, commit suicide, are murdered or are slaughtered in France.  Their deaths are mainly narrated second-hand through Simon's diary, letters to and from his mother, and his aunt's lengthy correspondence.  It is a rather la-de-da method of telling a horror story, although Bram Stoker pulled it off in &quot;Dracula.&quot;<br />It doesn't work quite as well, here.  The blurbs on the back cover refer to Aycliffe's story as &quot;spare,&quot; &quot;elegant,&quot; &quot;intelligent,&quot; &quot;literate,&quot; and &quot;filled with fine research.&quot;  The reader does learn quite a bit about shot towers, architecture, and the literature of black magic.  But as much as I like this author, I languished through passages about swans, swan-necked maidens, and a girl who hangs out in a ruined conservatory and doesn't seem to have anything to do with the plot--talking ghosts are a definite bore.  Maybe I was just lost in a thicket of multiple plots, deaths, and a horrible war, and this book deserves a second reading.oker pulled it off in &quot;Dracula.&quot; <br />It doesn't work quite as well, here.

Almost every county has its own variant, from the Black Shuck of East Anglia to the Bogey Beast of Yorkshire. In this novel, the ghost hound of Herefordshire on the Welsh border foreshadows a death in the Vaughan family.<br />This family is also cursed with an ancestor named Black Vaughan, who is believed by the author to be the basis for the hellish Hugo of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles.&quot;  Did Sir Arthur really take his tale of the phosphorescent Hound from the Welsh Border rather than foggy Dartmoor?  Rickman's theory on the origins of 'The Hound'  appeared in the most recent issue of the magazine &quot;Sherlock.&quot;<br /><br />Evidently this author discovered that Herefordshire had a population of medieval Baskervilles, not to mention Mortimers and Stapletons, and many local people still refuse to walk near Black Vaughan's home of Hergest Croft at night for fear of seeing his ghost and that of his hound.<br />Sherlock Holmes fans might want to read this book just to ferret out Rickman's research on Arthur Conan Doyle and his most famous dog story.<br /><br />Since &quot;The Prayer of the Night Shepherd&quot; is also a Merrily Watkins procedural, many familiar characters appear from Rickman's previous novels.  Merrily, Vicar of Ledwardine and Deliverance Consultant to the Diocese of Hereford reluctantly takes on a new role as a healer of physical ailments. Gomer Parry, the manic digger-for-hire who is one of my favorite Rickman creations, has a minor walk-on.  Merrily's daughter Jane is as usual, in the thick of the supernatural goings-on at Stanner Hall.  Poor Lol, the musician is still trying to spend quality time with Merrily, but is thwarted by a snowstorm, a couple of attempted murders, an attempted suicide, and a real murder--not to mention a phantom hound.<br />This book is an unsettling mix of murder mystery, indigestible lumps of Rickman's 'Hound' research, and swirls of supernatural vapor.  What really happened to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle when or if he visited Herefordshire?  What did Jane really experience in the tower room under the witch's hat at Stanner Hall?

In the first known instance, someone impersonates a Very Distinguished Royal personage who is known to accept gifts from her hosts--a painting or a piece of mine host's bric-a-brac that she fancies would look charming in her own palace:  in this case, it is an early Siennese Madonna that enchants her.  The gift is graciously offered and received, but when the backwoods peer learns that his visiting Royal was a fake, he is too embarrassed to pursue the matter.<br />Over the course of fifteen years, similiarly cunning thefts occur, and each time the victim is too mortified to pursue the matter.  Sir John Appleby was the Commissioner of New Scotland Yard when a couple of the incidents were reported, but they were underneath his radar screen at the time.  Now he is retired and his wife is trying to turn him into a horticulturist.  When he visits his son at Oxford, Appleby hears the story of bogus Royal from one of Bobby's classmates and decides to do a quiet investigation of his own.<br />He soon encounters peers, art dealers, and business magnates who have been touched up by the same audacious thief, who never uses the same ploy twice but always succeeds in humiliating his victims into silence.<br />Sir John decides to set up a sting of his own.<br />&quot;Picture of Guilt&quot; (1969), also known as &quot;A Family Affair&quot; is an exquisitely literate satire as well as a satisfying mystery.  Michael Innes focuses his laser wit on subjects as various as Oxford social clubs, rugby, snobbish peers, and acquisitive Royals.  As you might guess from the alternate title, Sir John's wife and son are also involved in the case of the cunning art thief.	2004-06-10

This subset of his mystery novels is undoubtedly a byproduct of the many years that Michael Innes (whose real name was John Innes Mackintosh Stewart) spent laboring in the halls of academia.  Among the seats of learning where he taught are Queen's University in Belfast, and the universities of Oxford, Adelaide, and Leeds.<br />The author could not help but involve a legion of eccentric, pompous, and even murderous professors in the death of the president of St. Anthony's College (modeled after the colleges at Oxford University). Their academic spats and bumblings are a good part of what makes this book readable.  Innes is wickedly funny when it comes to poking fun at the habits of his donnish colleagues and undergraduates.<br />&quot;Seven Suspects&quot; starts out as a locked room mystery where the only suspects are locked into the college grounds for the night.  The president's body is found in his own library, but we gradually learn that the corpse was subject to a great deal of postmortem perambulation as his colleagues try to establish their own alibis and manufacture evidence that points to their academic enemies.  Nothing is as it first seems, not even time of death.<br />A trio of undergraduates provides the comic relief as they chase one of the suspects (supposedly at an archeological dig in the Middle East) across the English countryside and finally deliver him to Inspector Appleby in a large wicker clothes basket (shades of Falstaff!).<br />As Inspector Appleby winds his way through the skeins of plot and counter-plot created by great intellects gone murderously askew, his intuition is played off against the rather unimaginative plodding of local Constable Dodd.  Dodd is a bit of a dry stick compared to the irrepressible Appleby, who in his very first appearance in this mystery (published in 1936), is already showing signs of what his successor at Scotland Yard refers to as his 'waywardness.'<br />Enjoy Inspector John Appleby's literary debut for the hijinks of the undergraduates, the plots and counter-plots of their devious professors, and the erudite style of their donnish creator.  The plot is overly complex, but it is brilliantly resolved and a lot of fun to read.ywardness.' <br />Enjoy Inspector John Appleby's literary debut for the hijinks of the undergraduates, the plots and counter-plots of their devious professors, and the erudite style of their donnish creator.

Books	3	2	3	N	Y	It was a dark and stormy night	This book is subtitled &quot;a collection of true and legendary ghost stories.&quot;  The author is a sort of British Hans Holzer and many of the stories are told in the first person.  Some are mere two- or three-page sketches---good for a plot outline if you're ever in the mood to write a ghost story.<br />Elliott O'Donnell was born in Bristol in 1872, a parson's son like M. R. James but there the similarity ends.  Antiquarian and Cambridge scholar M.R. James's ghost stories have been republished and reread, and have been frightening new generations of readers for over a century.  His stories, except perhaps for &quot;A Vignette&quot; are fiction.  He wrote them to entertain his friends and was never involved in spiritualism or ghost-hunting.<br />On the other hand Elliott O'Donnell made a career out of the supernatural, beginning at the turn of the last century, and it shows in his stories.  Those told in the first person singular are especially breathless, loaded with clich&eacute;s like &quot;the wind moaned and sighed and rattled&quot; or &quot;stiff and lifeless&quot; or &quot;nothing would induce them to stay another hour in the house.&quot;  All of the stories are told as true, and this sometimes leads the reader to chuckle rather than shiver while the author is racing through his vast collection of adverbs and adjectives.<br />Sprinkle a bit of salt on these tales, wait for a dark and stormy night, turn up the gas-light and enjoy.  Here are some of my favorites:<br />&quot;The Nun of Digby Court&quot;--A deceased nun in horrible smelling wool causes the new owners of Digby Court to abandon their mansion to &quot;cobwebs, stillness and ghosts.&quot;<br />&quot;The Haunting of St. Giles&quot;--A hospital ward is haunted by a wicked anesthesiologist, who murdered his rival in love.<br />&quot;The Phantom Trumpeter of Fyvie&quot;--Lord Fyvie, Earl of Dunfermline is cursed by a dying trumpeter.  Always before the death of a Gordon of Fyvie, &quot;his trumpet would be heard either within or immediately without the castle walls.&quot;  O'Donnell tells stories about other harbingers of death, including a phantom drummer, a phantom rider, a phantom clock, and an assortment of banshees.  One sometimes wonders why bassoonists or sackbut players never seem or return after death to haunt their former clients.<br />&quot;Will-O'-The-Wisp and Corpse Candles&quot;--This isn't really a story, just the author's commentary on various electrical and gaseous phenomena.  He is firm in his belief that electricity is not the sole explanation for St. Elmo's Fire.<br />&quot;The Fatal Phantom of Eringle Truagh&quot;--A kissing phantom lures young men and women to their doom.<br />&quot;A Haunted Hampstead House&quot;--While the author is investigating a haunted house, he drops his flashlight.  Something picks it up and hands it back to him.be heard either within or immediately without the castle walls.&quot;  O'Donnell tells stories about other harbingers of death, including a phantom drummer, a phantom rider, a phantom clock, and an assortment of banshees.

Our state was part of a great inland sea during much of the Paleozoic Era, got scraped and graded by Pleistocene glaciers, then covered with detritus that the glaciers left behind.  However, some of Earth's oldest eukaryotic life --organisms having cells in which the genetic material is contained within a distinct nucleus--has been discovered in the Precambrian rocks of Michigan's western Upper Peninsula.  The Rockies and even the Appalachians are mere youngsters compared to the Mesabi Range.<br />When John McPhee skipped over Michigan in his four-volume rhapsody on American geology, he was skipping over some of the 'deepest time' on Earth.<br />Luckily, we have Dorr and Eschman's &quot;Geology of Michigan&quot; to make up some of the gaps, although these authors unlike McPhee, were not writing for a general audience. This book could be used for a college-level geology course, and the reader is assumed to be familiar with terms such as 'syncline,' 'anhydrite,' 'eperic,' and 'terminal moraine.'<br />Rather than juxtaposing travels in the modern world with journeys through ancient terrains, Dorr and Eschman take an elevator from the basement of time in the Precambrian up through Michigan's modern topological features that have been formed by wind and water.<br />Some of my favorite chapters involve the ancient highlands and iron formations of the Upper Peninsula, but the authors also do justice to the reefs and seas of the Paleozoic Era, and the glaciology of more modern epochs.  They also devote a chapter to the 'Lost Interval'--an era extending from the end of the Pennsylvanian Period until the last stage of the Pleistocene, where the geologic record of Michigan is almost completely blank.  Don't expect to find many dinosaur bones in this state--marine fossils are our specialty, since Michigan was usually covered with water in one form or another.  Ancient sharks and coral reef fauna are discussed in detail.  Then this book skips up the paleontological time line to the mastodons and other animals that appeared during the retreat of the Late Pleistocene ice sheet.  But we are also home to &quot;asphaltic deposits of Precambrian algae in the Upper Peninsula&quot;--one of the most ancient records of life on earth.<br />Separate chapters are devoted to Michigan's rocks and minerals, and petroleum and natural gas formations.  The International Salt Mine under Detroit is also featured.<br />My edition of &quot;Geology of Michigan&quot; was issued in 1988 (it was originally published in 1970), so it does not discuss one of the most fascinating theories of  the origin of interbedded iron and silica deposits that date from the Cryptozoic time of the Pre-Cambrian, some 1.7 to 3 billion years ago. No banded iron formations are known in younger rock masses. One theory proposes at this early time, the atmosphere of earth was deficient in oxygen, and the iron and silica weathered from existing rock was transported to ocean basins with no oxidation. Here, they were precipitated by BIOLOGICAL processes to form the silica-rich iron deposits.<br /><br />Just a few years ago, coiled spiral fossils that were uncovered in a banded iron formation in a Michigan mine prompted a new look at how complex living cells evolved, and whether oxygen was absolutely necessary for the process. These coin-sized coils are the by far the oldest known fossils of macroscopic organisms, and the earliest evidence of eukaryotes.<br /><br />Michigan is not only home to some of the oldest rock formations on Earth, but also some of its earliest fossils.<br /><br />Boring, eh?coral reef fauna are discussed in detail.

I have no idea what kind of vegetables Joe sold.  I only remember the horse.  Now that I'm living upstate near a small town, horses are back on the highways again pulling Amish rigs.  I have it on good authority that the Amish are buying up the local farms and making a go of them with horse-power, after the more mechanized farmers went out of business.  Perhaps we discarded the nutmeat with the husk when we fell in love with gasoline-powered vehicles at the beginning of the last century.<br />This book takes a nostalgic look back to those times when horses moved freight, delivered milk, ice, and coal, and clattered over city streets pulling six tons of fire equipment.  It is filled with black-and-white photographs, drawings, and reproductions of ads for such items as the 'Studebaker Station Wagon' (horse-drawn, of course!).  You could even hitch your horses to one of three different sizes of air calliope, and entertain your whole village in the days before boom boxes.<br />Even readers who do not love or own horses might be interested in how the vehicles were built and sold, how the horses were stabled in cities, or what rules the wagonmen were supposed to follow when delivering their freight.<br />For those of us who do love horses, this book is an absolute mine of details about the draft horses and mules that were used to haul the grapes from the vineyards, the circuses to towns, and ice, furniture, and food to householders.<br />One of the many interesting photographs shows over fifty draft horses lined up outside their four-story horse hotel in Charlottenburg, Germany.  However, most of the other illustrations originated in America.  The text is quite interesting, too.  This bit of doggerel appeared in the August 16, 1899 issue of the &quot;Breeders Gazette:&quot;  &quot;One white foot - buy him/ Two white feet - try him/  Three white feet - deny him/  Four white feet - throw him to the crows.&quot;<br />Returning to the economics of horse-drawn versus gasoline-powered vehicles, the J.M. Horton Ice Cream Co. of New York had this to say:  &quot;We can run a two-horse rig at a cost of $15 a day including driver's wages.  It costs us $25 a day to operate a truck.&quot;<br />Maybe the Amish have the right idea after all--and where is the gasoline-powered tractor that can reproduce itself?try him/  Three white feet - deny him/  Four white feet - throw him to the crows.&quot;<br />Returning to the economics of horse-drawn versus gasoline-powered vehicles, the J.M.

In these stories, he sometimes uses less effective short-cuts to show us his antagonists and protagonists.  Adverbs are used with greater frequency---people pace nervously, glance cautiously, and nod soberly.  There is a fair amount of caricature.  Innes lapses into veddy British upper-class snobbery, to let readers know that there is something not quite right about a criminal suspect.<br />However, even short-hand Innes is fun to read.  His snobbery is delicious.  His Americans are amusing.  Commissioner of New Scotland Yard, Sir John Appleby is his usual ironic, witty, dangerously intelligent self.  He tackles poltergeists, corpses in the snow with only one set footprints leading to them, and rich uncles in fish ponds with his usual aplomb.<br />I wouldn't start with this short story collection if you are new to Michael Innes, but &quot;The Appleby File&quot; (1975) contains a rich set of puzzles for his long-term fans:<br />&quot;The Ascham&quot;--A snowstorm traps Appleby and his wife in the castle of a very athletic peer, along with a blackmailing scoundrel.<br />&quot;Poltergeist&quot;--Lady Appleby's Aunt acquires a poltergeist that doesn't seem to care whether it smashes a Ming vase or a souvenir teacup from Brighton Beach.<br />&quot;The Fishermen&quot;--Appleby accepts an invitation to trout-fish in Scotland and investigates the mysterious death of his host.<br />&quot;The Conversation Piece&quot;--A boardroom portrait is donated to the nation by a widow in honor of her late husband.  Shortly thereafter one of the widow's guests is murdered after making a curious comment about the portrait.<br />&quot;Death by Water&quot; (also the name of one of Innes's later novels)--A philosopher's investments go badly wrong and his death is thought to be a suicide until Appleby investigates.<br />&quot;A Question of Confidence&quot;--Bobby Appleby persuades his father to investigate a particularly gruesome murder of an Oxford scholar.<br />&quot;The Memorial Service&quot;--A mysterious guest attends a memorial service for an eccentric legal reformer, and Appleby must determine who actually died--or was murdered.<br />&quot;Two on a Tower&quot;--One of Appleby's fellow-vacationers falls to his death from an Italian tower.  Is it murder or suicide?<br />&quot;Beggar With Skull&quot;--On a motor tour of the West Country, Judith Appleby insists on stopping at Roydon Abbey to view a famous El Greco, which mysteriously vanishes.<br /><br />&quot;The Exploding Battleship&quot;--While sitting in front of Florian's caf&eacute; in Venice, Lady Appleby makes out a list of presents for her children.  A stranger is uncommonly curious about one of her choices of gift.  When he is later found dead, Appleby investigates.<br />&quot;The Body in the Glen&quot;--Appleby's friend, the Laird of Mervie invites the Applebys up for a holiday in the Highlands.  It turns out to be a busman's holiday for the retired inspector when a body drenched in gore is found lying beside the trout stream.  The corpse's jacket is inside-out.<br />&quot;Death in the Sun&quot;--a villa on a remote Cornish cape yields a splendid view from its roof, except for the detail of a corpse clad only in a wristwatch.<br />&quot;Cold Blood&quot;--Appleby's holiday on a rocky stretch of the South Coast is interrupted by a body washed up on the beach.  A note is found that reads &quot;I have taken this step at the earliest possible moment.&quot;  Is it suicide or murder?<br />&quot;The Coy Mistress&quot;--The Applebys are hiking through the Alps when two English undergraduates give them an unforgettable taxi ride.<br />&quot;TheThirteenth Priest Hole&quot;--Appleby takes a tour of an old manor and discovers a skeleton in the owner's closet.nth Priest Hole&quot;--Appleby takes a tour of an old manor and discovers a skeleton in the owner's closet.	2004-05-31

The depression occurred early on the first CD, track 4--&quot;Sing-Songers.&quot;  If there was one bird song I thought I knew it was the American Robin's cheerful warble.  Now I learn that there are three other birds that sound EXACTLY like the robin to me:  the Scarlet Tanager; the Summer Tanager; and the Rose-Breasted Grosbeak.<br />Oh no!  I'm going to have to listen to these CDs a hundred times before I can even be confident of the robin again.<br />Later that same night, as I was crawling moodily into bed, I cranked open the window and heard a series of low hoots that sounded like, &quot;Who cooks for you?  Who cooks for you?&quot;--Instant mood swing.  I lay there grinning in the dark, because I had just identified a Barred Owl.  He sounded exactly like he did on these CDs.<br />There is something so satisfying about being able to identify a song or a flower or even an animal track, as a reminder of the lives being lived around us--some of them very strange and beautiful.  You will be amazed the first time you step outside after listening to these CDs, by how the orchestra of bird song begins to sort itself out into individual instruments.  I was able to identify the Song Sparrow and the Oven Bird--two shy, unseen songsters that had been puzzling me for years.<br />Each of the tracks in this CD set contains narration as well as bird calls and bird song.  Birds are grouped on a track based on similarity of song, which is why you'll find the Mourning Dove on the Owl track.  According to the narrator, many people mistake them for owls.<br />At the end of the third CD, bird songs and calls are grouped together by habitat.  To test yourself, listen to the birds and try to recognize them without referring to the accompanying text insert.  I averaged round three out of ten correct identifications per group, but I expect to do better as I replay these fascinating CDs.<br />Added benefit:  this 'Guide to Birdsong Identification' will bewitch any resident cats.

The stories chosen by Mary Danby are a mixed lot, as is to be expected if they were rounded up rather quickly.  There are some gems by authors such as Roald Dahl, Ray Bradbury, Harry Kuttner, Mary Danby, herself, and Truman Capote.  But the book also includes old, oft-collected chestnuts (arguably chestnut masterpieces that you wouldn't mind reading over again) by Edgar Allen Poe, Honor&eacute; de Balzac, William Wilkie Collins, and Bram Stoker.<br />Here is a sampling of my favorites:<br />&quot;The Horror at Chilton Castle&quot; by Joseph Payne Brennan--This story is an interesting variation on the strange tale of the hidden room at Glamis Castle, seat of the Lords of Strathmore.  Supposedly when the earl's heir comes of age, he is taken to the hidden room by his father and the castle's factor and sees something so horrifying that his hair turns white, or he never laughs again, or he goes mad (a little hard on the succession).  The fifteenth earl, great-grandfather of Queen Elizabeth II, reputedly stated:  &quot;If you could only guess the nature of the secret, you would go down on your knees and thank God it was not yours.&quot;<br />Substitute the fictional Chilton Castle for Glamis Castle, and be prepared for a shocking explanation of the secret room.<br />&quot;Heartburn&quot; by Hortense Calisher--It's generally a bad idea to mix horror with humor or irony, but this story manages the mixture rather nicely.  A psychiatrist at an exclusive boys' school sets out to discover the reason for a sharp decline in morale, which seems to affect all of the students.  His curiosity results in a severe case of heartburn.<br />&quot;Nursery Tea&quot; by Mary Danby--An old nanny is invited to tea by her ex-charges, who are not as fond of her as their parents seemed to believe.<br />&quot;If Thy Right Hand Offend Thee...&quot; by A.

His young men are uniformly intelligent (one might even say intellectually arrogant), intrepid, and high-spirited.  They tend to actively seek adventure rather than waiting for adventure to stumble over them.<br />Dick Cranston was playing hide-and-seek on a midnight beach with his lover, Lady Blair, when a naked man walked out of the sea.  Shortly thereafter, someone starts shooting at him.  Cranston makes a split second decision to help the man escape from his would-be-murderers.  He doesn't know that his decision will involve him in a long, at times terrifying journey from the coast of Scotland to London.  He soon learns that the man from the sea is a British nuclear physicist who had defected to the Soviet Union at the beginning of the Cold War, and who now has his own reasons for returning home.<br />This Cold War melodrama has a bit of anti-communist rhetoric, although not nearly as much Evil Empire stuff as other mystery novelists who were writing at the same time, e.g. Rex Stout.  Innes is more interested in the complex character of the man from the sea, who betrayed his country for what might seem like trivial reasons to us, and who might be planning to betray her again.  We don't find out until the end of the book why the man from the sea returned to England.<br />Meanwhile there's a rousing chase across the quarries, beaches, and heath of Scotland wherein Dick Cranston falls out of love twice and into love for a third and probably last time.<br />Love, suspense, and the searing breath of danger envelope us as we follow Cranston and the man from the sea to their final, surprising destination.	2004-05-23

In &quot;Hare Sitting Up&quot; (1959), Michael Innes creates two twins who like to play the 'which twin am I' game with their friends---not so much as they used to though, as the Juniper twins have respectable professions now:  one is the head of a boys' school; the other is a scientist whose field of expertise is biological warfare.<br />When the biological warfare scientist goes missing, Sir John Appleby, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police (Scotland Yard) is called onto the case by the highest political powers in the realm.  It seems that a deadly bacteriological culture has also gone missing along with Howard Juniper.<br />Once the author has this rather far-fetched plot set up to his satisfaction, his readers are treated to an extended visit to a boys' school, to the decaying mansion of a duck-banding peer, and to the grim, 'prohibited' island of Arday off the coast of Scotland.  This novel is a smoothly blended combination of thriller and manor house mystery.<br />One of the antagonists is standard-grade evil, and Innes doesn't spend too much ink on him.  The other is truly mad, after a character in D. H. Lawrence's &quot;Women in Love:&quot;  &quot;You yourself, don't you find it a beautiful clean thought, a world empty of people, just uninterrupted grass, and a hare sitting up?&quot;<br />H.R.F. Keating in his 1987 book, \\"Crime &amp; Mystery:  the 100 Best Books,\\" has this to say about our literate Commissioner of Metropolitan Police:<br />&quot;To Appleby one could well apply the words which Michael Innes, writing under his own name [J.I.M.

If you read it, you'd certainly be less likely to share a taxi with someone you met on the airplane.<br />Once the author winds up and delivers his characters in the first forty or so pages, we have already experienced a stalking and a kidnapping.<br />The plots and subplots in &quot;Fit for Fate&quot; revolve around the relationship of the upright, rather humorless Athenian Police Director Roussos and his new boss Minister Petropoulos.  It is very easy to tell a good guy from a 'gamoto kerata' (a Greek phrase supplied by the author that I hope you'll never have to use).  Basically it's Spyro Roussos and his friends versus evil politicians, terrorists, and assorted criminals.<br />The author, Eugene Aubrey Stratton spent seven years living and working in Greece, so this novel's background feels quite authentic.  His years as a CIA Case Officer also lend verisimilitude to the kidnapping and terrorist scenes.  The abduction of the American Ambassador's daughter is almost too authentic and gripping.

It may gnaw occasionally on the deck, but if it abandons its burrow, Professor Kurta opines that a skunk is likely to take up residence.<br />Plus it's fun to watch the woodchuck amble across the lawn, chomping the heads off of the dandelions--I guess I can put up with the occasional gnawing noises.<br />This book, first published in 1957 and brought up-to-date in 1995 is filled with the natural histories of eighty-three mammals living in the Great Lakes ecosystem, livened by the occasional wry personal anecdote.  There are numerous black-and-white photographs and drawings, including range maps and multiple views of mammal skulls.  &quot;Mammals of the Great Lakes Region&quot; is meant to be backpacked into the field and has chapters on capturing small mammals and specimen preparation.<br />Some of the author's language is specialized but there is a good glossary at the back of the book that explains terms like &quot;altricial--poorly developed at birth, usually with eyes and ears closed, often lacking hair, and requiring large amounts of parental care.&quot;<br />There is no need to rush out and apply for a scientific collecting permit and a set of traps, as the author includes detailed information on the identification of mammals by their signs and habits.  For instance, the bog lemming feeds on grasses, rushes, and sedges and since the seed heads tend to be out of its reach, it snips the stems into evenly spaced lengths.  This small mammal leaves other clues:  &quot;Piles of bright green [excreted] pellets and discarded plant clippings, all trimmed to about the same length, are indicative of bog lemming activity.&quot;  Another visual:  &quot;[Their] runways interconnect feeding sites, toilet areas, and the nest.&quot;<br />&quot;Mammals of the Great Lakes Region&quot; is both fun to browse and good for a straight read-through on a cold winter's weekend, when many of the local mammals are hibernating, or scampering through their cozy tunnels beneath the snow.n&quot; is both fun to browse and good for a straight read-through on a cold winter's weekend, when many of the local mammals are hibernating, or scampering through their cozy tunnels beneath the snow.	2004-05-14

This subset of his mystery novels is undoubtedly a byproduct of the many years that Michael Innes (whose real name was John Innes Mackintosh Stewart) spent laboring in the halls of academia.  Among the seats of learning where he taught are Queen's University in Belfast, and the universities of Oxford, Adelaide, and Leeds.<br />The author could not help but involve a legion of eccentric, pompous, and even murderous professors in the death of the president of St. Anthony's College (modeled after the colleges at Oxford University). Their academic spats and bumblings are a good part of what makes this book readable.  Innes is wickedly funny when it comes to poking fun at the habits of his donnish colleagues and undergraduates.<br />&quot;Death at the President's Lodging&quot; starts out as a locked room mystery where the only suspects are locked into the college grounds for the night.  The president's body is found in his own library, but we gradually learn that the corpse was subject to a great deal of postmortem perambulation as his colleagues try to establish their own alibis and manufacture evidence that points to their academic enemies.  Nothing is as it first seems, not even time of death.<br />A trio of undergraduates provides the comic relief as they chase one of the suspects (supposedly at an archeological dig in the Middle East) across the English countryside and finally deliver him to Inspector Appleby in a large wicker clothes basket (shades of Falstaff!).<br />As Inspector Appleby winds his way through the skeins of plot and counter-plot created by great intellects gone murderously askew, his intuition is played off against the rather unimaginative plodding of local Constable Dodd.  Dodd is a bit of a dry stick compared to the irrepressible Appleby, who in his very first appearance in this mystery (published in 1936), is already showing signs of what his successor at Scotland Yard refers to as his 'waywardness.'<br />Enjoy Inspector John Appleby's literary debut for the hijinks of the undergraduates, the plots and counter-plots of their devious professors, and the erudite style of their donnish creator.

If you are interested in the natural history of our land, his 'American Seasons' series is the perfect place to start reading.  All of his books, including &quot;A Naturalist Buys an Old Farm&quot; reflect the philosophy of Thoreau and Muir and the value they placed on the meaning and beauty of the natural world.<br />This author belongs to the same generation of nature writers as Rachel Carson, Loren Eiseley, Sigurd Olson, and Lewis Thomas, but his writing style is less didactic, gentler, more wondering.  He shares his life on an old Connecticut farm now reverting to its original wildness, with keen observation and unabashed wonder.  Edwin Way Teale was the opposite of cynical.  He was a man who loved to wake up in the morning, whether it was to freshly fallen snow, the &quot;trip-hammer tattoo&quot; of a flicker &quot;in the full flush of his springtime exuberance,&quot; or even the fiery blisters from a run-in with poison sumac.  As to the latter experience, he writes that it was shared with John Burroughs who, sixty-eight years before on the banks of the Hudson, &quot;had viewed the world through one eye...while the other was swelled shut as a result of encountering poison sumac.&quot;<br />In chapter one, &quot;Three Circles on a Map,&quot; Edwin and his wife Nellie spend three years searching for the perfect home, surrounded by various aspects of American wilderness, e.g. woods, a stream, a swamp, open meadows (not your usual home-buyer's requirements).  After so many years of crisscrossing the United States and recording their travels in the four 'American Seasons' books, they were ready to sink roots and find contentment in their immediate surroundings.  They finally find their dream house in a rural northeastern corner of Connecticut, and settle in to observe her wildlife and her seasons.<br />&quot;There is, in the gaze of a skunk, something innocent and childlike,&quot; writes Teale, and so it is with him, too.  He writes with knowledge, yet with an 'innocent gaze,' of his and Nellie's years on Trail Wood Farm.  Perhaps the reason this book appeals so strongly to me is that I'm also dreaming of a place to settle lightly on the land.<br />Aren't we all?<br />Instead of the usual city-dweller's &quot;Winter is icummen in, Lhude sing Goddamn,&quot; wouldn't it be more satisfying to spend an afternoon, like this author, watching a woodchuck prepare its burrow for hibernation, or observing two skunks wrestling over a bit of food?<br />Through the pages of Teale's book, we are able to live in nature, at least vicariously.<br />Contemporary essayist and natural historian Ann Haymond Zwinger writes a very sad introduction to &quot;A Naturalist Buys an Old Farm.&quot;  It colored my whole reading of the book, so you might want to save the introduction for last.ent and childlike,&quot; writes Teale, and so it is with him, too.

Some like bald eagles and cardinals are a no-brainer.  But what about all of those indeterminate grayish-brownish-whitish birds that may only be identifiable by their habits?  This is where a book like &quot;Life Histories of North American Nuthatches, Wrens, Thrashers, and Their Allies&quot; proves to be useful.  It contains 142 black-and-white photographs of birds performing activities such as feeding and incubating, and in the case of the white-breasted nuthatch, creeping head-first down a tree-trunk---not just sitting on a branch and looking mysterious.<br />By no means are the photographs the highlight of this volume.  Arthur Cleveland Bent was one of America's foremost ornithologists, and his twenty-volume series on North American birds was originally published under the sponsorship of the Smithsonian Institution.  In this particular volume he and his correspondents have compiled specific observations on about 104 different birds, including various nuthatches, creepers, wren-tits, dippers, wrens, mockingbirds and thrashers.  Bent also utilizes the writings of America's great naturalists of the past, including Audubon, Burroughs, and Brewster.<br />This Dover edition is an unabridged, unaltered republication of the original 1948 edition.  Its anecdotal style is very readable, even charming.  The copious details of avian nesting habits, courtship patterns, plumage and field markings, food, songs, and flight habits are made interesting by the dedication and enthusiasm of the hundreds of observers who contributed to this book.<br />In it, I finally learned why one of my favorite birds, the white-breasted nuthatch moves head-first down tree trunks.  Francis H. Allen (1912) points out an advantage in this procedure, saying:  &quot;I suspect that by approaching his prey from above he detects insects...which would be hidden from another point of view.&quot;  The woodpeckers and the creepers can take care of the rest by moving up the trunk.<br />By all means, begin your bird-watching career with some of the good field guides such as &quot;Eastern Birds&quot; by Roger Tory Peterson.  When you are ready to delve more deeply into the natural history of your local birds, I strongly recommend these volumes by Arthur Cleveland Bent.nother point of view.&quot;  The woodpeckers and the creepers can take care of the rest by moving up the trunk.<br />By all means, begin your bird-watching career with some of the good field guides such as &quot;Eastern Birds&quot; by Roger Tory Peterson.

In both novels, Sir John Appleby, retired Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police (New Scotland Yard) is invited to a new neighbor's outdoor fête and murder ensues.  However, this time it is a charity masquerade at Drool Court, where an alarming proportion of the male guests are disguised as sheiks.<br />Sir John and his friend, Chief Constable Tommy Pride both arrive dressed as Robin Hood.  Colonel Pride has received a mysterious request from the Foreign Office that he and his men should keep an eye on the affair, but he was not informed as to what the local police were supposed to be keeping an eye on.  Appleby soon discovers that there is a genuine sheik, Emir Hafrait at the party, and furthermore he has been the target of numerous assassination attempts.  Sir John's deduction concerning Colonel Pride's assignment is verified when one of the pseudo-sheiks is found on the archery range with an arrow through his back.<br />A herpetologist laden with grass snakes and adders wanders onto the scene.  A bevy of nefarious Druids attempts to purify Drool Court, using the ancient ceremony of Perlustration.  A local troop of Boy Scouts reenacts the relief of Mafeking.  A hot air balloonist takes too many swigs out of his gin bottle and tumbles to the sward.  All of these seemingly unrelated incidents come together in a quick, glorious, tongue-firmly-in-cheek finale.<br />Innes takes many delightful twists and turns in this farcical adventure.  The only two minor problems I had with the story concern the herpetologist.  He didn't seem to know that snakes are deaf, and he referred to Appleby's adventures in &quot;The Seven Suspects&quot; (1936) as having occurred at Oxford, when in actuality our serial detective solved this particular mystery at St. Anthony's College (which was admittedly modeled after Oxford).  I honestly believe Innes worked the herpetologist into the plot just so he could include 'Adders' in his title.<br />Note to animal rights activists:  no snakes were harmed in the construction of this plot, although the Druids do not share in the generally happy ending.nto the plot just so he could include 'Adders' in his title.<br />Note to animal rights activists:  no snakes were harmed in the construction of this plot, although the Druids do not share in the generally happy ending.	2004-04-29

For one thing, he is no longer officially a policeman.  Colonel Tommy Pride is the local Chief Constable, and Appleby isn't sure whether he likes him.  When he comes face-to-face with Colonel Pride at a church fête on Allington's estate, they bristle at each other distrustfully.<br />Then Appleby realizes that Colonel Pride is practically his double.  They are both elderly men with a military bearing.  Both are wearing tweeds and almost identical green trilbys.  In fact:  &quot;If he and Pride...were to hunch themselves down on each side of a fireplace, the effect would be... that of ...twinned china dogs...&quot;<br />In later novels, Sir John and Colonel Pride become good friends (see &quot;Sheiks and Adders&quot; (1982)), but in &quot;Appleby at Allington&quot; (1968) they are still wary of each other.  Nevertheless, Pride supplies the police power necessary to tow a car and corpse out of their host's ornamental pond, and supplies Appleby with the information he needs to solve a series of mysterious deaths.<br />One might refer to Colonel Pride as Appleby's Lestrade, even to a bit of bumbling on the Chief Constable's part.<br />Michael Innes combines many themes that he has used in other Appleby mysteries:  buried treasure; mysterious scientists; eccentric rectors; feuding relatives; and just a touch of spy story.  Intellectual arrogance, as in many of Innes's novels is the villain's Achilles' heel.<br />Never, I warn you, never invite Sir John to dinner, to a church fête, or to your sound-and-light show on the castle parapet if murder is to follow.<br />Michael Innes (John Innes Mackintosh Stewart) was born in Edinburgh, educated at Oxford, and taught English in universities all over the world.

Steward has written broadcast scripts and many crime stories under the pseudonym of Michael Innes, most prominent among them his Inspector Appleby detective novels.  John Appleby begins as a mere inspector of the Metropolitan Police (New Scotland Yard) in the early novels such as &quot;Death at the President's Lodging&quot; (1936) and eventually retires as Sir John Appleby, Commissioner of said organization.<br />&quot;Death at the Chase&quot; (1970) takes place after Sir John's retirement, and begins as he is taking a long walk and comes up against a rather high wall that marks his reclusive neighbor's property.  On impulse, he scrambles over the wall and is met by an infuriated old gentleman.<br />&quot;'What the devil do you mean,' the old gentleman demanded, 'by pitching yourself into my property like that?'&quot;<br />Unfortunately Sir John has decided to explore beyond the wall on a very peculiar anniversary---it is on this date each year that someone attempts to assassinate his old neighbor, who had been captured by the Germans during the last war and made to betray his comrades in the Maquis.  The date marks a terrible massacre of the French by the German occupation troops.<br />Sure enough, as Appleby and his neighbor, Martyn Ashmore draw near an ancient, tumble-down mansion, someone shoves a large stone off of the roof, nearly killing them both.  Sir John hears someone running down an uncarpeted staircase, then the roar of a motor-cycle engine.<br />&quot;'Another failure,' Ashmore said.  'Three hundred and sixty-five days to go.'&quot;<br />His prediction turns out to be inaccurate.  Meanwhile we meet more of Ashmore's relatives, including a distant French connection who shows up shortly after the stone came tumbling off the roof.<br />There are plenty of suspects to choose from when real murder is finally committed. In spite of a multitude of red herrings, &quot;Death at the Chase&quot; is one of Innes's more straightforward mysteries.

Eight chapters are devoted to general topics in snake biology, including anatomy, feeding, venoms (more snakes are venomous than we used to think), predation and defense, social behavior, reproduction, evolution, and conservation.<br />The illustrations supplied by world-acclaimed nature photographers Michael and Patricia Fogden are absolutely gorgeous---snakes in every aspect of their dangerous, seductive charm, including my favorite of Peringuey's Adder in Namibia.  This snake's tail protrudes above the sand as a lure, and if you look very closely at the picture, you might make out eyes and head scales that are almost completely invisible between the grains of sand.  It is quite startling to be looking at a pile of sand and suddenly see the outline of an adder's head.<br />The author, Harry W. Greene is Curator of Herpetology in the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology and Professor of Integrative Biology at the University of California, Berkeley.  He opens each chapter in 'Snakes' with an essay that considers the subject from a more personal perspective:  many of his fellow herpetologists have been bitten by venomous snakes, and some have died.  The essays lead to Greene's epilogue and his answer to the question, &quot;Why snakes?&quot;<br />This book is a fascinating read.  I sat down to learn more about garter snakes when I came across several of these handsome reptiles that were just emerging from hibernation.  I soon found myself rereading the whole book.  There are fourteen references in the index to 'Thamnophis sirtalis' (the common garter snake) but they are scattered throughout the book in interesting chapters such as &quot;Diet and Feeding.&quot;  I didn't know garter snakes were semi-aquatic and dined mainly on other watery creatures such as frogs.  They also form mating balls which may stay together for two or three days---one female and multiple males.  They spend the winter together in hibernaculums--one hibernaculum in Ontario was found to have over 6,000 garter snakes!<br />The author's favorite reptiles are the venomous snakes, their ability to cause damage measured in the number of mice that would die from the poison injected through a single bite.  &quot;Drop for toxic drop, the Inland Taipan (Oxyuranus microlepidotus) wins hands down:  a bite from this Australian cobra relative contains enough venom to kill two hundred thousand mice...&quot;  In the introductory essay, the author and some of his friends go scrambling through a Costa Rican rain forest, looking for the deadly Bushmaster (Crotalus mutus).  They weren't bitten by the Bushmasters they found, just by &quot;huge black ants with the most intensely painful and long-lasting sting of any hymenopteran.&quot;<br />If you'd like to explore the beauty and seductive grace of these ancient reptiles against a detailed backdrop of their biology and natural history, I highly recommend that you read &quot;Snakes:  The Evolution of Mystery in Nature.&quot;  I own the hard-bound version, and it is 315 pages of dense text and hypnotic photographs.wo or three days---one female and multiple males.

His lone loss--and it was a big one--came in the 1953 Kentucky Derby to 25-1 longshot Dark Star.<br />Imagine the consequences if Native Dancer would have won:  he would have shattered Citation's record for consecutive wins (sixteen); and he probably would have been voted Thoroughbred of the Century over Man O'War, who also lost a single race.<br />Author Eva Jolene Boyd develops several theories as to why Native Dancer lost the Derby:<br />--He was bumped near the start, and his jockey Eric Guerin lost his cool.  He tried to take his mount up the inside, where he was blocked and forced to take up twice.  If Native Dancer had taken his usual route up the outside, he would have kept out of trouble and won the Derby.<br />--Another rider deliberately blocked Native Dancer.  This is jockey, Eric Guerin's theory.<br />--Native Dancer followed a rather peculiar race route to the Derby, and his trainer, Bill Winfrey didn't have the big gray colt 100% fit.  There may be a grain of truth to this theory.  Almost 35 years after the race, Winfrey admitted to a writer:  &quot;I didn't have him fit.&quot;<br />--The bad ankles theory.  This seemed to be favored by certain members of the press.<br />--The hat on the bed theory.  When trainer, Bill Winfrey entered his Lexington hotel room a few days before the Derby, he discovered that one of the reporters had left his hat on the bed--very bad gris-gris for superstitious Thoroughbred trainers.<br />Take your choice of theory as to why the Gray Ghost lost the big one, but be sure to read this book.  The author covers Native Dancer's career both on the race course and at stud.  In both careers, he performed superlatively well.	2004-04-20

In the first known instance, someone impersonates a Very Distinguished Royal personage who is known to accept gifts from her hosts--a painting or a piece of mine host's bric-a-brac that she fancies would look charming in her own palace:  in this case, it is an early Siennese Madonna that enchants her.  The gift is graciously offered and received, but when the backwoods peer learns that his visiting Royal was a fake, he is too embarrassed to pursue the matter.<br />Over the course of fifteen years, similiarly cunning thefts occur, and each time the victim is too mortified to pursue the matter.  Sir John Appleby was the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police (New Scotland Yard) when a couple of the incidents were reported, but they were underneath his radar screen at the time.  Now he is retired and his wife is trying to turn him into a horticulturist.  When he visits his son at Oxford, Appleby hears the story of bogus Royal from one of Bobby's classmates and decides to do a quiet investigation of his own.<br />He soon encounters peers, art dealers, and business magnates who have been touched up by the same audacious thief, who never uses the same ploy twice but always succeeds in humiliating his victims into silence.<br />Sir John decides to set up a sting of his own.<br />&quot;A Family Affair&quot; (1969), also known as &quot;Picture of Guilt&quot; is an exquisitely literate satire as well as a satisfying mystery.  Michael Innes focuses his laser wit on subjects as various as Oxford social clubs, rugby, snobbish peers, and acquisitive Royals.  As you might guess from the title, Sir John's wife and son are also involved in the case of the cunning art thief.	2004-04-18

Blackwood was a pantheist and a  member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, eventually branching out into Buddhism and Rosicrucianism, and his stories reveal a deep, mystical appreciation of Nature, with a capital 'N.'  The author was an avid camper and spent many happy summers in the backwoods of Canada communing with his incomprehensible, dangerous, and beautiful mistress.<br />Nature serves as his haunted domain in some of the John Silence stories, most notably &quot;The Camp of the Dog,&quot; and also in two of his most anthologized stories, &quot;The Willows&quot; and &quot;The Wendigo.&quot;<br />You will need to equip yourself with two reading gears in the John Silence stories (not the author's best work by any means):  a leisurely course through his descriptions of nature and the awesome terror of his hauntings; and a fast forward through the mystical, occult blah-blah whereby John Silence tries to explain away the terror and awe.<br />John Silence serves as both a psychiatrist and an exorcist in these stories, and the hapless, bumbling narrators are always falling about in awe of his occult powers.  However, the good physician is a bit schizophrenic about the occult.  In this book's first story, &quot;A Psychical Invasion&quot; a potential client tries to explain why she has come to him:<br />&quot;Your sympathetic heart and your knowledge of occultism---&quot;<br />&quot;Oh, please--that dreadful word!&quot; he [Dr. Silence] interrupted, holding up a finger with a gesture of impatience.&quot;<br />And yet John Silence is always reading minds, performing magical rites, and defending ordinary mortals against the powers of Darkness.<br />All of these stories will send a chill down your spine, as long as you skip lightly past the mystical, rather pompous blather of the main character:<br />&quot;A Psychical Invasion&quot;--A young author who takes a mind-expanding drug accidentally puts himself in touch with an ancient evil.  John Silence and his cat and his collie spend a night in the author's haunted house on Putney Heath and are attacked by dreadful, occult forces.<br />&quot;Ancient Sorceries&quot;--A masterful portrait of a shy misogynist who escapes from a noisy trainload of English tourists, only to find himself in a very strange, sleepy little French village.  As the narrator is leaving the train, a Frenchman leans out and mutters a half-understood warning that ends in: &quot;&aacute; cause du sommeil et &aacute; cause des chats.&quot;  Beware of sleep and cats.  Blackwood slowly builds a powerful, eerie atmosphere around the narrator as he tries to decide whether to escape, or to stay forever in the mysterious village.<br />&quot;The Nemesis of Fire&quot;--This story has some genuinely frightening moments as fire elementals and an ancient Egyptian curse haunt a peaceful, English countryside.  Blood is drunk, faces are blasted to ruin, and you'll need to employ your fast-forward gear through quite a few explanatory paragraphs.<br />&quot;Secret Worship&quot;--As dusk falls in the hills of the Black Forest, a silk merchant revisits the school where he spent his childhood with the Moravian Brothers (just as the author did).  Lots of atmosphere and a slow build to a terrifying climax:  &quot;And then the room filled and trembled with sounds that...were the failing voices of others who had preceded him in a long series down the years.&quot;  Blackwood is not very specific in his descriptions of the Other World.  His glancing images and sounds leave much to the reader's horrified imagination.<br />&quot;The Camp of the Dog&quot;--A jolly campout on an island in the Baltic Sea slowly turns terrifying as a mysterious canine dogs the footsteps (sorry) of a young woman.<br />&quot;A Victim of Higher Space&quot;--A mathematician learns how to peer into the higher dimensions of space-time and is horrified by what he discovers.ons of space-time and is horrified by what he discovers.	2004-04-16

The only novel from this prolific author to follow it was &quot;Appleby and the Ospreys&quot; (1986).<br />Sir John, retired Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police (Scotland Yard) no longer strays very far from home.  He tells his friend, the local Chief Constable, that he is more of a Mycroft than a Sherlock now.  However, he still occasionally lunches with the neighbors, and when this novel opens, Sir John and his wife are meeting their new neighbors over a slightly pretentious lunch of scallops and champagne.<br />Carl Carson, the &quot;newish and rather unattractive&quot; neighbor spends lunch fretting over whether his wife will do or say the wrong thing.  He is a nouveau riche financier with some shady dealings in the City, and mistakes Appleby for someone &quot;who had been high up in the Inland Revenue.&quot;  His wife, Cynthia refers to Appleby as the &quot;Commissionaire.&quot;<br />Really, the snobbery and counter-snobbery of the new versus the old gentry are what make this novel sparkle.  In his later Appleby novels, Innes no longer relied as heavily on character eccentricities, surreal settings, or dense plotting.  Instead, his readers scud merrily downstream on waves of witty, ironic dialogue, literary allusiveness, and an undertow of murderous intent.<br />The plot is transparent.  If nothing else, the title gives it away and the first narrator is Carson, himself.  His wife seems to have gone seriously round the bend and is chatting up their new neighbors with the exploits of an imaginary son.  Carson, who sees serious financial problems looming dead ahead, decides to kidnap his nonexistent son, who is supposedly returning from America, convert his capital into ransom money, then disappear as another victim of the kidnapping plot---with the loot, of course.<br />His problems begin, although he is not aware of them at first, when Carson has to find someone to pose as his imaginary son.  Every one is taken in by the conspiracy, including the Applebys, until a sudden, violent twist at the very end of the book.<br />This is a quick, enjoyable read, and don't believe Sir John when he tells the Chief Constable that &quot;Mycroft has retired.&quot;  He still has one novel to go, and his sharp-edged wit and elegant sleuthing will live on for a long while in the hearts of his readers.re of them at first, when Carson has to find someone to pose as his imaginary son.

For one thing, he is no longer officially a policeman.  Colonel Tommy Pride is the local Chief Constable, and Appleby isn't sure whether he likes him.  When he comes face-to-face with Colonel Pride at a church fête on Allington's estate, they bristle at each other distrustfully.<br />Then Appleby realizes that Colonel Pride is practically his double.  They are both elderly men with a military bearing.  Both are wearing tweeds and almost identical green trilbys.  In fact:  &quot;If he and Pride...were to hunch themselves down on each side of a fireplace, the effect would be... that of ...twinned china dogs...&quot;<br />In later novels, Sir John and Colonel Pride become good friends (see &quot;Appleby's Other Story&quot; (1974)), but in &quot;Death by Water&quot; (1968) they are still wary of each other.  Nevertheless, Pride supplies the police power necessary to tow a car and corpse out of their host's ornamental pond, and supplies Appleby with the information he needs to solve a series of mysterious deaths.<br />One might refer to Colonel Pride as Appleby's Lestrade, even to a bit of bumbling on the Chief Constable's part.<br />Michael Innes combines many themes that he has used in other Appleby mysteries:  buried treasure; mysterious scientists; eccentric rectors; feuding relatives; and just a touch of spy story.  Intellectual arrogance, as in many of Innes's novels is the villain's Achilles' heel.<br />Never, I warn you, never invite Sir John to dinner, to a church fête, or to your sound-and-light show on the castle parapet if murder is to follow.<br />Michael Innes (John Innes Mackintosh Stewart) was born in Edinburgh, educated at Oxford, and taught English in universities all over the world. His scholarly career includes works on Rudyard Kipling and Thomas Hardy, but he is better known as the creator of Inspector John Appleby, whose exploits inspired a lasting vogue for literary (and literate) mysteries.

In the first known instance, someone impersonates a Very Distinguished Royal personage who is known to accept gifts from her hosts--a painting or a piece of mine host's bric-a-brac that she fancies would look charming in her own palace:  in this case, it is an early Siennese Madonna that enchants her.  The gift is graciously offered and received, but when the backwoods peer learns that his visiting Royal was a fake, he is too embarrassed to pursue the matter.<br />Over the course of fifteen years, similiarly cunning thefts occur, and each time the victim is too mortified to pursue the matter.  Sir John Appleby was the Commissioner of New Scotland Yard when a couple of the incidents were reported, but they were underneath his radar screen at the time.  Now he is retired and his wife is trying to turn him into a horticulturist.  When he visits his son at Oxford, Appleby hears the story of bogus Royal from one of Bobby's classmates and decides to do a quiet investigation of his own.<br />He soon encounters peers, art dealers, and business magnates who have been touched up by the same audacious thief, who never uses the same ploy twice but always succeeds in humiliating his victims into silence.<br />Sir John decides to set up a sting of his own.<br />&quot;Picture of Guilt,&quot; also known as &quot;A Family Affair&quot; (1969) is an exquisitely literate satire as well as a satisfying mystery.  Michael Innes focuses his laser wit on subjects as various as Oxford social clubs, rugby, snobbish peers, and acquisitive Royals.  As you might guess from the alternate title, Sir John's wife and son are also involved in the case of the cunning art thief.	2004-04-10

There are five narrators in all, each with his own distinctive voice.  There are also several solutions to the murder, and Innes makes each solution seem like the correct one when presented by one of the narrators.  I think this is his most rigorous and plausible mystery---well, except for the intrusion of the messenger rats---this author cannot resist a slight touch of the surreal.<br /><br />The Laird of Erchany, Ranald Guthrie has two outstanding traits:  his miserliness, which is causing his castle to fall down around his ears; and his fear of death:  he chants &#34;Lament for a Maker&#34; through his rat-infested halls, and the villagers of Kinkeig quite rightly think him mad. He is served by the Hardcastles, a seedy old couple, and Tammas, a brain-damaged boy.  Even as Ranald Guthrie might remind you of an evil Prospero, and his niece Christine of Miranda, Tammas will make you think of Caliban.<br /><br />Two guests are stranded at Erchany on Christmas Eve by a snow storm, and one of them just happens to be the Laird of Erchany's American heir.  When Tammas struggles through the snow drifts and into the village of Kinkeig on Christmas morning, the early kirk-goers are interrupted by cries of murder most foul.<br /><br />Inspector Appleby, a solicitor, a cobbler, a physician, and the Laird of Erchany's unwanted guests must work together to prevent more lives from being destroyed by a plot that seethes in fratricide, incest, and a centuries-old clan feud.seethes in fratricide, incest, and a centuries-old clan feud.	2004-04-09

When Sir John stumbles across the house after his car breaks down in the middle of a very dark night, its front doors are open wide, all of the lights are on, and there is a cold collation set out in the dining room, along with a bottle of champagne on ice.  In the bedroom, there is even a hot water bottle tucked under the bedclothes--and it is still warm.<br />Sir John, retired Assistant Commissioner of New Scotland Yard, can't help feeling like Goldilocks in 'The Three Bears' when no one answers his shouted requests for assistance.<br />Michael Innes (J.I.M. Stewart) has been compared to James in his use of allusion and his exquisitely drawn characterizations, done mainly through dialogue.  Also Jamesian is his loving, detailed description of Ledward Park.  With all of the description and dialogue, you might assume there isn't much action but Appleby, in spite of his claims to be elderly involves himself in a couple of rousing chases and fights, one in an octagonal room that is completely lined with mirrors.<br />The plot is complicated by two sets of villains, but Sir John sorts everything out with his usual &eacute;lan.  South American politics, a multitude of heirs, an outrageous butler, and a false marriage, plus two accidental pummelings of a perfectly blameless rector are explained away by breakfast.  In fact, Sir John toddles off with the rector, whom he had twice mistaken for a villain, and clarifies ALL in the best tradition of British Golden Age mysteries.<br />If you are a already a fan of Margery Allingham, Edmund Crispin, or Dorothy Sayers, you definitely need to add Michael Innes's mysteries to your reading list.  \\"The Open House\\" is perfect in its class, and you will also learn quite a bit about Carolingian architecture.	2004-04-03

Owen Lee, who is known for his erudite commentaries on Metropolitan Opera broadcasts has recently published another book about the Wagner's Ring Cycle, called &quot;Athena Sings. Wagner and the Greeks.&quot;  Father Lee is a Classics scholar, so it should be no surprise that the Greeks also inhabit &quot;Wagner:  The Terrible Man and His Truthful Art.&quot;  One of the chief characters that Wagner is compared to in this slender book is Philoctetes, who was given a great gift by the god Apollo, but was also maimed with an incurable wound.<br />The three essays that make up this book were written to be given during the 1998 Larkin-Stuart lectures at the University of Toronto.  These lectures are devoted to religious and ethical concerns, and Father Lee took the opportunity to examine the relationship of the artist, Wagner to his art.<br />The first lecture, &quot;Wagner and the Wound That Would Not Heal&quot; tells the story of Philoctetes, who was shunned by his fellow soldiers because of his unhealing wound.  Finally, they exiled him on an island on their way to conquer Troy.  In their tenth year of war, after the death of Achilles, the Greeks heard a prophecy &quot;that the city would never be taken unless the wounded Philoctetes was brought to Troy with his bow (the gift from Apollo).&quot;  The Greeks sailed back to the island where they had abandoned Philoctetes and persuade the wounded, bitter man to use his gift to help them.<br />Father Owen is not a Wagner apologist, but he asks us to recognize our debt to the &quot;hateful, wounded man [we] are in need of&quot;---he whose music can penetrate deeply into our psyche and bring us, if not peace, then at least self-knowledge.<br />The second lecture, &quot;Wagner's Influence: The First Hundred Years&quot; discusses the effect that Wagner exercised, for good and ill, on music, art, literature, politics, and psychology.  The author quotes philosopher Bryan Magee as being able to say:  &quot;Wagner has had a greater influence than any other single artist on the culture of our age.&quot;<br />Of course, the worm at the core of this lecture is Wagner's &quot;unquestioned influence on Adolf Hitler.&quot;  There are still people who won't listen to Wagner's music, and Father Lee acknowledges this artist's blatant anti-Semitism:  &quot;He probably wreaked more havoc on himself with his essay 'Judaism in Music' than with anything else he wrote.&quot;  A hundred years later, Goebbels was able to use it as vicious propaganda.<br />Can we acknowledge this hateful, wounded man and still be pierced by the beauty of his music?  The author goes on to quote Leonard Bernstein's article in the 'New York Times,' entitled &quot;Wagner's Music isn't Racist:&quot;<br />&quot;...And if Wagner wrote great music, as I think he did, why should we not embrace it fully and be nourished by it?&quot;<br />The third and last lecture that completes this book is entitled, &quot;You Use Works of Art to See Your Soul.&quot;  Father Owen Lee concentrates on Wagner's early opera, &quot;Tannh&auml;user&quot; to prove his point, with help from authors such as Baudelaire and Goethe.  He is even tempted to wonder if Wagner had Martin Luther in mind when he created his tormented young hero, &quot;who was gifted in song, clashed with the Pope, sought refuge in the Wartburg, defied the society he knew, and profoundly changed it.&quot;<br />Or perhaps, Wagner was thinking of Wagner.<br />These essays have convinced this reviewer at least, that a seriously flawed human being can produce indispensable, undying, truthful art.d a greater influence than any other single artist on the culture of our age.&quot;<br />Of course, the worm at the core of this lecture is Wagner's &quot;unquestioned influence on Adolf Hitler.&quot;  There are still people who won't listen to Wagner's music, and Father Lee acknowledges this artist's blatant anti-Semitism:  &quot;He probably wreaked more havoc on himself with his essay 'Judaism in Music' than with anything else he wrote.&quot;  A hundred years later, Goebbels was able to use it as vicious propaganda.<br />Can we acknowledge this hateful, wounded man and still be pierced by the beauty of his music?

It was pressed on me by a friend whose reading tastes I don't normally share.  I started reading &quot;The Country Kitchen&quot; to be polite, and ended up reading straight through to the end.  Even though I wasn't even born until well after this book had gone through twenty-three editions, it had the power to evoke memories of my own childhood--at least the stories my grandfather used to tell me about his life on the farm.<br />Della Lutes was born in 1872 and lived on a farm near Jackson, Michigan until she was sixteen, when she left home to teach school.  She eventually became the editor of &quot;American Motherhood,&quot; &quot;Today's Housewife,&quot; and in 1923 the &quot;Modern Priscilla&quot; magazine.  When the publishing firm she worked for went bankrupt during the Great Depression, Della became a freelance writer and produced &quot;The Country Kitchen,&quot; which started out as a series of articles in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly.&quot;  Her book was named &quot;The Most Original Book&quot; of 1936 by the American Booksellers Association and was described by Christopher Morley as a 'gastronomical autobiography.'<br />I don't know whether I'll ever try the recipe for &quot;salt-risin' bread&quot; or buy a quarter of beef to be &quot;nicely ripened by hanging a couple of weeks or so in the woodshed,&quot; but I'll long remember the story of how Della's father entertained the Ladies' Church Aid Society by turning a baby skunk loose during their annual dinner.  And then there's the story of Little Runt, who was fated to be the Thanksgiving pig, and Old Wart, the garden toad.  Della's story wheels you through the complete cycle of seasons with all of the sights and smells of rural Michigan (you might not want to know what some folks used for home insulation, come late Autumn).<br />This author deserves a place on your shelf right next to Laura Ingalls Wilder.  She has saturated this book with the tastes and smells of a late nineteenth-century rural kitchen, bringing back recollections I never knew I had.  Maybe it's got something to do with ancestral remembrance, since nearly all of our folks were rural up until the early decades of the last century.<br />All I can urge you to do is read it and remember.right next to Laura Ingalls Wilder.

When it does, it is usually adorned in the lineaments of farce, as is the case in &quot;The Long Farewell&quot; (1958).<br />Lewis Packford, the great Shakespearean scholar, has come to marriage late in his bookish career, and it has enchanted him so thoroughly that he goes to the altar twice---without an intervening divorce. When both wives simultaneously descend upon Urchins, his ancestral mansion, he appears to take the easy way out of his bigamous dilemma. He is found in his library (most of Innes's corpses are to be found in libraries) with a bullet through his head, a revolver in his hand, and a suicide note with the ink still wet, by his side.<br />Most appropriately, the suicide note is a quotation from the Bard--not Othello's &quot;Farewell, farewell...why did I marry,&quot; as you might expect. It is rather &quot;Farewell, a long farewell...&quot; from Cardinal Wolsey's soliloquy in Shakespeare's &quot;King Henry the VIII&quot; (Act III, Scene 2).<br />Packford had been dropping hints about the discovery of a sixteenth-century Italian manuscript, annotated by Shakespeare himself, as the framework for his &quot;Othello,&quot; but this priceless object seems to have disappeared from the scholar's library upon his death.<br />Sir John Appleby finds it difficult to believe that Packford committed suicide (he thinks the suicide note is a bit uninventive for such a brilliant scholar), so he invites himself up to Urchins where he is introduced to the two angry wives, plus a house party of scholars and bibliophiles who were present at the time of death.<br />Might the missing manuscript be connected with Packford's death? Did one of his wives take it upon herself to murder the bigamous bibliophile? Or did Packford really commit suicide?<br />Sir John weighs in to another notable mixture of crime and scholarship, English eccentrics and American millionaires, farce, murder, and crumbling gothic masonry. &quot;The Long Farewell&quot; is a delightful mystery and by the time the body count reached three, even I had fingered the correct suspect.llionaires, farce, murder, and crumbling gothic masonry. &quot;The Long Farewell&quot; is a delightful mystery and by the time the body count reached three, even I had fingered the correct suspect.	2004-03-24

A story from Gaelic mythology is clumsily translated, and the author spends too much print on his own classification scheme for ghosts.<br />Some of the stories in this book appear to be incompletely edited--In the chapter on &quot;Strange Happenings&quot;, the author quotes at length from a friend who ecountered a ghostly piper, and it seemed to me as though his story was copied from a letter whose pages were jumbled together in the wrong order. One moment the friend is strolling along the burn, the next moment he is roused from his bed by the sound of a ghostly piper.<br />Also, many of the stories in &quot;Ghosts Spritis and Spectres of Scotland&quot; have been told elsewhere, most notably in James Robertson's &quot;Scottish Ghost Stories&quot;.<br />Nevertheless, this book still earns its four stars. In chapter 6, &quot;Tales of Horror&quot; the author lets out all of the stops, and I had to go seek human companionship before I could finish the story about the haunted house in the neighborhood of Glasgow's Blythswood Square. In &quot;Ghostly Noises and Lights&quot;, there are lots of eerie variations on death divination and second sight. The planks used to make coffins seem to be especially prescient.<br />Definitely read &quot;Ghosts Spirits and Spectres of Scotland&quot; if you like frightening stories with a Gaelic twist. There are enough ghostly pipers in this book to entertain even the most ardent admirer of Scottish lore.<br />One final quibble: I wish the author or publisher had mentioned the source of this book's illustrations, because they provide just the right atmosphere for the stories.

Not only is he broke, but the Tax Inspector is beating at the door.  Then his agent calls with a mysterious commission, and George meets a man who, once he removes his false beard, could be his identical twin.<br />As you may have already guessed from this book's title, George lets himself be persuaded into a major impersonation.  Nicholas Comberford wants to return to the Riveria and fall back into the arms of his mistress, while George travels up to Bruton Abbey on the chilly Yorkshire dales and pretends to be him.  Nicholas cheerfully admits to being a rogue and a sensualist, but he wants to secure a place in the will of his fabulously wealthy Great-Aunt Prudence.  Unfortunately, his great-aunt is a strict teetotaler.  Fortunately, she has a weak heart and isn't expected to last out the year.<br />George travels up to Bruton Abbey under the guise of the reformed prodigal coming home to comfort Great-Aunt Prudence in her precipitous decline toward the family burial vault.  Nicholas has loaned him the memoirs of Great-Uncle Magnus to bone up on family history, and at first no one seems to suspect the changeling in their midst.<br />But George realizes that Nicholas has misled him on two minor items:  Great-Aunt Prudence has no objection to alcohol; and the old woman is in ruddy good healthy and is expected to live for decades.<br />Then Miss Bostock, Great-Aunt Prudence's companion begins to blackmail George as the imposter that he is.  Can anything else go wrong?<br />Well, yes.  Great-Aunt Prudence attempts to fix her false heir's interest in one of the neighboring landowner's hearty twin daughters.  Her butler attempts to play Miss Bostock's blackmailing game with George.

In fact, I'm guessing he may have come with the puns first and then fitted the stories to them.<br />Normally in his novels, character development is one of this author's great strengths.  In these stories, he sometimes uses less effective short-cuts to show us his antagonists and protagonists.  Adverbs are used with greater frequency---people pace nervously, glance cautiously, and nod soberly.  There is a fair amount of caricature.  Americans are always filthy rich and/or eccentric and they talk funny.  Innes also lapses into veddy British upper-class snobbery, to let readers know that there is something not quite right about a criminal suspect.<br />However, even short-hand Innes is fun to read.  His snobbery is delicious.  His Americans are amusing.  Assistant Commissioner of New Scotland Yard, Sir John Appleby is his usual ironic, witty, dangerously intelligent self.  Art and literature are richly mined, as they are in this author's longer novels.  A Pieter Breughel landscape is at the heart of one story.  A speech from Hamlet forms an important clue in another.<br />I wouldn't start with this short story collection if you are new to Michael Innes, but &quot;Appleby Talks Again&quot; (1956) is a rich confectionary for his long-term fans--eighteen delicious morsels of mystery:<br />A Matter of Goblins<br />Was he Morton?<br />Dangerfield's Diary<br />Grey's Ghost<br />False Colours<br />The Ribbon<br />The Exile<br />Enigma Jones<br />The Heritage Portrait<br />Murder on the 7.16<br />A Very Odd Case<br />The Four Seasons<br />Here is the News<br />The Reprisal<br />Bear's box<br />Tom, Dick and Harry<br />The Lombard books<br />The Mouse-Trap	2004-03-12

The story line weaves and doubles back upon itself.  Gods and mortals are reborn into new bodies, and it's a bit hard to keep track of who's who, especially at novel's end.  Zelazny's hero, Sam has many reincarnations and many names including Mahasamatman, Maitreya (&quot;Lord of Light&quot;), Binder of Demons, Buddha, and Siddhartha.<br />Sam is part of the original crew from &quot;The Star of India,&quot; many of whom borrowed the names, attributes, and aspects from the Hindu pantheon of gods as the new planet was wrested from its original inhabitants.  Many of the crew, not unreasonably, discover that they enjoy godhood.  They build themselves a heaven and set about ruling the peasants through their priest-mouthpieces.  Any signs that the lower classes are re-acquiring their technological heritage, such as the reinvention of the printing press are thoroughly squelched.  The gods are in charge of reincarnation, and if someone incurs the displeasure of Heaven in his current life, he may (as one of the gods puts it) find himself reincarnated as a gelded water buffalo.<br />Sam believes that the lower classes should be given the benefit of technology, and along with a group of like-minded gods called 'accelerationists' sets out to challenge the more conservative deities.  There are several wars (which are not told in sequence) and Sam repeatedly incurs the wrath of Heaven.  He responds with Promethean defiance, even as he is about to die the true death: &quot;I will hate Heaven with every breath that I draw. If Brahma has me burnt, I will spit into the flames...&quot;<br /><br />Finally he reinvents an old religion, borrowed from the distant memory of Earth.  In order to lessen the influence of the Hindu pantheon, he becomes a monk who is understood by some to be the Buddha.<br /><br />Sam loses this phase of the war, too, and becomes truly disembodied.<br /><br />But did he really lose?  The beliefs of Buddhism and accelerationism remain and thrive among men.  Bifocals are reinvented.  When Sam's atman (soul) is reincarnated into one final body by the death god, Yama, he renews his titanic struggle against a weakened Heaven.<br />Zelazny's writing style tends to vary between the formal when he is deviating from the 'present,' and a livelier tone when he is narrating Sam's current adventures.  When the tone is detached and archaic, such as &quot;...This is the story of how the prince did bait the one-armed receiver of devotions before the Temple...&quot; then the reader can assume that Zelazny is abandoning the straight-line narrative for a bit of history essential to the plot.<br />&quot;Lord of Light&quot; is sometimes confusing, but this Hugo-award-winning novel is bursting with inventive detail and thought-provoking ideas on the necessity for reinventing religions.  Above all it has Sam: Zelazny's eternal rebel against everything that smacks of conservatism and oppression.ut did he really lose?

The Vegans are basically tourists, lingering among the ruins of the last non-radioactive territories on Earth.  The historical Three Days of War occurred between human and human, or rather between dirty bomb and dirty bomb.  The back cover of &quot;This Immortal&quot; ironically states &quot;Welcome to Earth (Pop. 60,000).&quot;  (Later in the text, we learn that Earth's population is more like four million).<br />&quot;This Immortal&quot; (1966) was Zelazny's first SF novel, and it shared the Hugo Award for Best Science Fiction Novel of the Year with Frank Herbert's &quot;Dune,&quot; so it is no lightweight post-Apocalypse adventure story.  In fact, I think the best way to understand &quot;This Immortal&quot; is to read Lawrence Durrell's chronicles of the Greek Isles, most especially &quot;Prospero's Cell&quot; and &quot;Reflections on a Marine Venus&quot;---or better yet, read Percy Shelley's &quot;Prometheus Unbound,&quot; which is referred to more than once in this novel.<br />Like Shelley's Prometheus, Zelazny's hero, Conrad Nimikos is mankind's potential savior.  Like Prometheus, he suffers and almost self-destructs in trying to save his chosen people (the humans who remained on Earth).  Instead of stealing fire from the gods, he sets out to steal back Earth from the Vegans.<br /><br />At an earlier stage in his career (nobody knows quite how old he might be), Nimikos was a terrorist.  Now he has lost some of his destructive impulse (his hubris), and sets out to protect the Vegan, Cort Myshtigo in order to discover the alien's true purpose in touring Earth's remaining monuments.<br />The real mystery of &quot;This Immortal&quot; is not so much the Vegans' intentions toward Earth as it is the true identity of Conrad Nomikos.  His mistress, Cassandra playfully refers to him as a 'kallikanzaros' (this is where I had to refer to my Durrell), which a Greek term for a little cloven-hooved satyr, who causes mischief of every kind.  Conrad is a huge man, superhumanly strong, but he is also incredibly ugly and walks with a limp.<br />Did he at one time have a cloven hoof?<br />Like the kallikanzaros, Conrad is a trickster, and deceives Vegans and humans alike into thinking his previous incarnation, the terrorist leader 'Karaghiosis,' has died in a boating accident.<br /><br />Once more turning to Durrell, we learn that 'Karaghiosis' is a stock character in Greek drama--in fact, &quot;the embodiment of Greek character...based on the idea of the impoverished and downtrodden little man getting the better of the world around him by sheer cunning. Add to this the salt of a self-deprecating humour and you have the immortal Greek.&quot;<br />So Nomikos-Karaghiosis-Prometheus is the embodiment of 'the immortal Greek,' who might or might not be--according to a hint at novel's end, plus references to the kallikanzaros--the Great God, Pan.<br />Conrad himself refers to &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot; as &quot;Percy B's dud epic,&quot; but then, all of Zelazny's heroes tend to be self-deprecating.<br />Zelazny has succeeded in capturing the spirit of a people and place in &quot;This Immortal.&quot;  I think his Hugo was well-deserved.r, who causes mischief of every kind.

When it does, it is usually adorned in the lineaments of farce, as is the case in &quot;The Long Farewell&quot; (1958).<br />Lewis Packford, the great Shakespearean scholar, has come to marriage late in his bookish career, and it has enchanted him so thoroughly that he goes to the altar twice---without an intervening divorce.  When both wives simultaneously descend upon Urchins, his ancestral mansion, he appears to take the easy way out of his bigamous dilemma.  He is found in his library (most of Innes's corpses are to be found in libraries) with a bullet through his head, a revolver in his hand, and a suicide note with the ink still wet, by his side.<br />Most appropriately, the suicide note is a quotation from the Bard--not Othello's &quot;Farewell, farewell...why did I marry,&quot; as you might expect.  It is rather &quot;Farewell, a long farewell...&quot; from Cardinal Wolsey's soliloquy in Shakespeare's &quot;King Henry the VIII&quot; (Act III, Scene 2).<br />Packford had been dropping hints about the discovery of a sixteenth-century Italian manuscript, annotated by Shakespeare himself, as the framework for his &quot;Othello,&quot; but this priceless object seems to have disappeared from the scholar's library upon his death.<br />Sir John Appleby finds it difficult to believe that Packford committed suicide (he thinks the suicide note is a bit uninventive for such a brilliant scholar), so he invites himself up to Urchins where he is introduced to the two angry wives, plus a house party of scholars and bibliophiles who were present at the time of death.<br />Might the missing manuscript be connected with Packford's death?  Did one of his wives take it upon herself to murder the bigamous bibliophile?  Or did Packford really commit suicide?<br />Sir John weighs in to another notable mixture of crime and scholarship, English eccentrics and American millionaires, farce, murder, and crumbling gothic masonry.  &quot;The Long Farewell&quot; is a delightful mystery and by the time the body count reached three, even I had fingered the correct suspect.can millionaires, farce, murder, and crumbling gothic masonry.  &quot;The Long Farewell&quot; is a delightful mystery and by the time the body count reached three, even I had fingered the correct suspect.	2004-03-03

We meet him as he drops into the third-floor office of his latest advisor---through the window of course.  Fred has gone through many advisors in his twelve-year stint as an undergraduate--his late uncle's estate will only support him up to the moment when he is awarded a degree--but this particular advisor seems to have a grudge against him.  He thinks he has Fred trapped in a schedule that will force him to graduate.<br />Fred manages to escape the dread specter of graduation one more time by signing up for field work in Australia, a literature course on troubadours, and two hours credit for advanced basket weaving.<br />He has other problems, though.  There are the strange messages that sometimes appear as sky-writing:  &quot;DO YOU SMELL ME DED?&quot;  His old roommate gets married, and when Fred attempts to lure a newer, more beautiful model into his apartment, she bolts upon encountering a state of total dishevelment.

According to the late musicologist, performer, and writer Robert Donington, the complex structure of opera also demands a commitment from its producers to honor the composer's original intentions.<br />As an example of a performance where the composer's intentions were not honored, and the staging did not support the words and music, this author cites Patrice Ch&eacute;reau's Marxist vision of &quot;Siegfried&quot; at Bayreuth in 1976:  &quot;a controversial production that substituted an irrelevant modernist symbolism for Wagner's explicitly prescribed archetypal imagery.&quot;<br />&quot;Opera and its Symbols&quot; is by no means a thorough, century-by-century survey of operatic archetypes.  Donington singles out certain operas such as Monteverdi's &quot;Orfeo,&quot; Verdi's &quot;Rigoletto,&quot; and Tippett's &quot;The Midsummer Marriage,&quot; while other composers such as Rossini must make do with a single paragraph.  An earlier book by this author, &quot;The Rise of Opera,&quot; allows him to recall &quot;in the briefest possible way&quot; the beginning of Western opera in the late Renaissance, when interest in Neoplatonic symbolism and the poets of antiquity was at its height.<br />In this atmosphere, it was logical for opera to originate with deliberate as opposed to spontaneous symbolism, and various allegorical creations such as Virtue and Love in Monteverdi's &quot;L'incoronazione di Poppea&quot; are given life, costume, and song.<br />The absurdly melodramatic operatic extravaganzas of the Age of Reason are viewed as a broadening out into the archetypes of human relationships.  Donington is especially fascinated by the Oedipal scenario.  After all, he himself is a citizen of the 20th century and must view opera--even the 'exotic and irrational' works of Lully and other Baroque composers--through the symbolism of Freud and Jung.<br />I personally feel the author overdoes the mother/incest imagery just a bit--really, my only complaint about this wise and interesting book.  A brief look at the index reveals references to &quot;Bizet's mother problem (pp.146-47),&quot; &quot;Britten's mother problem (p.179),&quot; &quot;Tchaikovsky's mother problem (pp. 148-49),&quot; and &quot;Puccini's mother problem (p. 151).&quot;  Then there is the transmuted mother-longing in Wagner's operas, and the barely suppressed incest theme of &quot;Rigoletto.&quot;<br />Donnington lingers fruitfully through four chapters on Richard Wagner and his haunting archetypes of redemption.  Of course, this composer was &quot;unusually aware of his own symbolical intentions.&quot;<br />The final chapters deal with 20th century composers, especially the British Tippett and Britten.  The author has some startling insight on Stravinsky and the insecurity of an age that is haunted by the possibility of its own obliteration.  He is a bit more brusque with Phillip Glass, comparing the experience of attending his operas to one of those &quot;nightmares, in which you most wish but are least able to move your own legs and get away.&quot;<br />&quot;Opera and its Symbols&quot; will definitely add a new dimension to my opera experience.

It has an interesting lead character, Derek Secrest, who is pulled out of Naval flight officer training school a week before his graduation, in order to participate in a top secret government project.<br />Navy slang and acronyms lent verisimilitude to the book's first thirty or so pages, and Derek's disappointment in missing his graduation drew my sympathy.  The top secret project involving psionic powers has been done many times, but I was willing to follow Derek on his reluctant journey to develop his telepathic talent.  I liked the setting, his friends, and even some of the characters who were lifted right out of the SF bible of stock players, such as the humorless but brilliant female scientist.<br />Derek is ordered to track down a terrorist and determine what he plans to do with a supply of deadly nerve gas.  Okay.  Fine.  That sounds like a practical military application for telepathy.  Derek reads his terrorist's mind prevents the release of the nerve gas, but then all sorts of plot devices begin hitting the fan.  Goddesses, Titans, and assorted aliens from outer space show up who have nothing to do with the original terrorist plot.  Derek and his friends take a space plane into orbit and are kidnapped by the aliens, who turn out to be humans who have developed a superior technology based on magic.<br />&quot;Forge of the Titans&quot; then descends into techno-babble.  Normally, I like a book with snappy dialogue, even when I'm being fed all sorts of pseudo-science (or maybe I should say futuristic science---Heinlein did this so very well without stalling his plot or lessening my attraction to his characters).  But I really lost interest when the author began to crank out reams of sentences like:  &quot;Soon, the remaining antimatter missles were being launched at 'sprint' ranges, making interdiction difficult even for point-defense lasers.&quot;  The book turned into a sort of &quot;Psionic Hercules versus the Titans in Outer Space.&quot;<br />Finally, my favorite character is killed off in what seems like a feeble bid for reader sympathy, but he dies so stupidly it simply ended up annoying me.<br />I don't think I'll bother with the inevitable sequel.versus the Titans in Outer Space.&quot;<br />Finally, my favorite character is killed off in what seems like a feeble bid for reader sympathy, but he dies so stupidly it simply ended up annoying me.   <br />I don't think I'll bother with the inevitable sequel.	2004-02-26

Owen Lee, who is known for his erudite commentaries on Metropolitan Opera broadcasts has recently published another book about the Wagner's Ring Cycle, called &quot;Athena Sings. Wagner and the Greeks.&quot;  Father Lee is a Classics scholar, so it should be no surprise that the Greeks also inhabit &quot;Wagner's Ring:  Turning the Sky Around.&quot;  This book is only 120 pages long, but like Wagner's Ring it seems to inhabit the whole human experience from the birth of consciousness to the death of god.<br />If ever a book should published in an audio version, it is this one.  'Turning the Sky Around' stemmed from a series of talks that the author gave during Met broadcast intermissions, and while an 'Index of Musical Themes' might be okay for those who have a piano handy, how wonderful it would be if the book could simply 'play' them for the rest of us.  I wonder if the original talks were taped and are lying about in a Met Opera warehouse somewhere---probably just wishful thinking on my part.<br />Even opera lovers who have every reason to dislike Wagner the man (especially the blatant anti-Semitism of Mime's character and death) will gain insight into the astonishing scope of the Ring from this slender book.  As Father Lee puts it:  &quot;The subject of Wagner's Ring is not much less than the world itself, the world projected in myth and music.&quot;<br />This book's title is taken from an epiphany experienced by the Christian apologist C. S. Lewis, who wrote about the first time he saw Arthur Rackham's illustrations for Wagner's Ring:  &quot;The sky had turned round...Pure 'Northernness' engulfed me; a vision of huge, clear spaces hanging above the Atlantic in the endless twilight...&quot;  Father Lee chides those directors who attempt to remove the Ring from nature and make it into a Marxist ideologue, or clutter it up with Chicago gangsters and machine guns (a Covent Garden production).  But he also argues that the Ring is outside time and nature, and certainly has less to do with the twelfth-century &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; than it has to do with our own inner lives---with &quot;...man's inner struggle with his own destructive impulses...of the emergence in him of new ideas, and the dying in him of transforming deaths.&quot;<br />Please read this book, even if you think you don't like opera.  It is intuitive and passionate commentary on one of Western Civilization's greatest works of art.and certainly has less to do with the twelfth-century &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; than it has to do with our own inner lives---with &quot;...man's inner struggle with his own destructive impulses...of the emergence in him of new ideas, and the dying in him of transforming deaths.&quot;<br />Please read this book, even if you think you don't like opera.

The new Inspector is a bit of a dry stick compared to the irrepressible Appleby---he refers to his predecessor as 'the wayward Appleby'---but Cadover is slowly acquiring Appleby's habit of uttering mystifying non sequiturs (at least they seem like non sequiturs at the time of utterance).  He has also acquired his predecessor's yellow Bentley (which surprised me, because I'm positive Appleby was still driving it after he retired--see \\"Appleby's Other Story\\"), and a young Watson named Harold, who narrates the middle portion of this mystery.<br />The narrator for Parts I and III is Nicolette, former actress and wife of the soon-to-be-deceased Sir George Simney, who is murdered in the traditional manner, by a blunt object in his own library at midnight, during a snowstorm, while his butler is lurking just outside the library door.<br />Sir George is one of this author's most unsavoury baronets.  He tormented his relatives, slept with a shotgun by his side, seduced half the countryside, and abused his beautiful wife. Needless to say, he had many enemies, including the local rector and, of course, his own flesh-and-blood.  In fact Nicolette is surprised to learn that her husband has more relatives than she bargained for, when three Australian Simneys show up one evening while the British members of the family are hurling imprecations and sherry round the dinner table.<br />Twenty-seven hours later, after mysterious references to that 'Dismal Swamp' business, and the seduction of one of his new and unwelcome guests, Sir George is dead.<br />Now the redoubtable Detective-Inspector Cadover and his assistant, Harold must sort through quite a long list of suspects, including all of the family members at Hazelwood, and must also track down the suspect who left a trail of footprints in the snow outside the window of the deceased's library.

Among the seats of learning where he taught are Queen's University in Belfast, and the universities of Oxford, Adelaide, and Leeds.<br />&quot;Old Hall, New Hall&quot; is not a mystery so much as it is a farcical treasure hunt and an even more farcical love story.  I have to admit that I sneaked a peek at the book's end to make certain that neither of my two favorite characters ended up with the wrong woman.  Innes's young men who graduate from Oxford, aspire to write 'the' Kafkaesque novel, and end up tutoring undergraduates on Higher Literary Forms are bound to be naïve about beautiful, amoral treasure-hunters.<br />The narrator, Colin Clout, BA, B Litt., newly appointed to the Faculty of Arts in the Old Hall is assigned an attic office, still crammed with the lumber of previous generations of Jorys, whose descendents now live in the New Hall.  He is a decent young man (in spite of his unfinished novel in the style of Kafka) and is definitely not the brains of this story.  Those belong to his friend, the librarian, Sadie Sackett, and to a fellow named George Lumb (also a would-be novelist) who is engaged in cataloguing a very neglected library up at New Hall.<br />Libraries are an important part of this story because of the goings-on of two Victorian Jorys, one of whom collected beautiful mistresses, and the other who collected tombs.  They were brothers, and it was the elder and heir who happened to have the slight necrophilous bent.  According to a series of letters from their sister to her old governess (Innes is a dead-on mimic of spinsterish Victorian correspondents), the two brother-collectors embarked upon a wager as to who could bring home the greatest treasure from abroad.<br />The elder Jory looted a tomb and brought back a treasure of gold and jewelry (and incidentally, the Circassian corpse that was wearing the jewelry).  Then the plot darkens.  The necrophilous Jory seems to have swapped his treasure for whatever it was that his younger brother brought home to win the wager.  Or did he?  The modern Jorys, especially one beautiful treasure-hunter named Olivia from the cadet branch of the family, would really like to know whether the swap was made, and incidentally the current hiding place of the looted gold and jewels.<br />The author could not help but involve a legion of eccentric, pompous, and even fake professors in the treasure hunt and their spats and bumblings are a good part of what makes this book sparkle.  Innes is wickedly funny when it comes to poking fun at the habits of his donnish colleagues.<br />In fact, Innes is one of the finest, most unjustly neglected authors from the British Golden Age of Mystery.  If you haven't already discovered him, &quot;Old Hall, New Hall\\" is a good place to start among his non-Appleby comedies-of-manners.

Other books employing this theme are &quot;Sargasso of Space&quot; (1955), &quot;Exiles of the Stars&quot; (1971), &quot;Forerunner Foray&quot; (1973), &quot;Forerunner (1981), and &quot;Moon Called&quot; (1982).<br />In most of these novels, Norton describes the ancient Forerunner ruins as vast, underground high technology installations where ordinary human beings can be driven crazy just by the odd angles of the walls, the mazes and tunnels where they're always getting lost, or by the harmful emanations from the ancient and only partly understood machines.<br />However in &quot;Forerunner&quot; (1981) and &quot;Forerunner: the Second Venture&quot; (1985), Norton's Forerunners have gone beyond technology and into the realm of what we would call supernatural powers.<br />&quot;Forerunner: the Second Venture&quot; is a sequel to &quot;Forerunner,&quot; and continues the story of Simsa, once a runner and fetcher for an old Burrow-dweller in the ancient port of Kuxortal, and now a reincarnated Forerunner with superhuman talents, including telepathy, the ability to channel killing forces through her sun-and-moon scepter, and the ability to tamper with other peoples' minds.<br />In &quot;Forerunner,&quot; Simsa teamed up with the off-worlder Thom who came to Kuxortal in search of his missing brother.  She and Thom survived many harrowing adventures together, and they seemed like good friends at the end of the book, but in this sequel Simsa suspects Thom of abandoning her to his fellow scientists.  No one has ever met a living Forerunner, and Simsa finds herself an 'honored guest,' i.e. prisoner, on a starship where at least one of the scientists would like to have a go at dissecting her.  She escapes from the starship, via its life boat which will automatically search out a planet where humans can, at the very least, breathe the atmosphere.<br />And that's exactly what the lifeboat finds:  a planet where Simsa can breathe the air, but which otherwise seems inimical to life.  She and her zorsal (think 'bat' with four feet and cute fern-like antennae) almost perish in a searing, rocky wasteland where the only thing that moves is an eerie river of sand.<br />Norton has invented some interesting aliens in 'The Second Venture.'  There are the bad-smelling, octopus-like blobs that live in the rivers of sand, but there are also intelligent creatures in one secluded valley where Simsa finally stumbles upon food and water.  Simsa must persuade the furry lobster-things that she too is intelligent and worthy of their respect.  She must also do battle with the Forerunner who is co-inhabiting her body, and last but not least, find Thom who has crash-landed into one of the rivers of sand while searching for Simsa.<br />Norton's heroine is by turn sour, prickly, brave, and fiercely independent.  She's hard to like, but it is easy to admire her, especially in her fight almost-to-the-death to gain control of her body and mind from the ancient and powerful Forerunner.<br />This book is primarily an adventure story that wanders from one alien wonder to another, without really tying everything together into a neat, tidy plot.  There is quite a bit of character development as Simsa struggles to somehow share her mind and body with the Forerunner.  There is also a nice sub-theme of friendship as Simsa drags Thom out of one dilemma after another, even though she thinks she despises him.<br />But it's really hard to love a surly heroine with superhuman powers.

But suppose you are the new jester-turned-king of a small principality on Discworld, and you want to be friends with all of your neighbors, even if they happen to be undead.  (Hint:  always check to see if a country has a disproportionate number of 24-hour Walgreens before issuing your invitations).<br />Not only does King Verence invite a family of vampires to his daughter's christening, his invitation to the powerful witch, Granny Weatherwax goes mysteriously astray.<br />Foopahs abound.  Granny Weatherwax closes up her cottage as though she never means to return.  Her friend and fellow-witch, Nanny Ogg is upset by King Verence's choice of a priest of Om as the official baptizer--a priest who relies on bits of strategically placed paper to jog his uncertain memory--which is how the little princess ends up with the name 'Esmerelda Margaret Note Spelling of Lancre.'<br />Of course, Lancre did once have a king named, 'My God He's Heavy the First.'<br />This is obviously going to shape up as one of the most disastrous christenings since Sleeping Beauty got the shaft (or more correctly, the spindle) from the thirteenth fairy godmother.  Then events take a turn for the worse when the vampires happily chow through Nanny Ogg's special garlic dip without a single rumble of indigestion.<br />I love all of the Granny Weatherwax/Nanny Ogg Discworld novels, and even though &quot;Carpe Jugulum&quot; tackles some unusually serious themes (its vampires are truly evil, unlike the loveable, teetotalling Otto in &quot;The Truth&quot;), it is still vintage Pratchett and vintage Granny.<br />It is amazing how an author of such absurd fantasies can still convey such a bone-chilling description of evil.  Pratchett is much more than a 'simple' comic novelist.	2004-02-06

They figure the dwarves are up to their old trick of turning lead into gold.  The &quot;Ankh-Morpork Times&quot; ('the truth shall make you fred') is born almost by accident and soon it has a rival in the &quot;Inquirer,&quot; which publishes stories like 'Woman gives birth to Mountain Bongo' and 'Elvis ate my gerbil.'<br />&quot;The Truth&quot; is a strongly plotted fantasy with serious messages about freedom of the press and ethical journalism.  Of course, you're going to have to chuck your sanity out the window when reading one of Pratchett's Discworld books, most especially this one.  It might be a good idea to chuck your theology, too.  Who knows?  If the Universe is infinite, maybe there is a Disc-shaped world somewhere, supported by four elephants on top of a turtle.  Maybe their lawyers really are zombies (some excellent characterization here), and the &quot;Ankh-Morpork Times&quot; really has a teetotalling vampire as its press photographer---a vampire who turns to dust every time his flash goes off, and has to be revived with a piece of blutw&uuml;rst, a bit of dog meat, a drop of blood---whatever is at hand.  Hopefully not blood since our Vampire, Otto has given up the b-word.<br />There is also a pair of very nasty villains named Mr. Pin and Mr. Tulip, who assume the disguises of Brother Upon-Which-the-Angels-Dance Pin and Sister Jennifer of The Little Flowers of Perpetual Annoyance in order to pursue a dog who might blab out what really happened on the morning when Ankh-Morpork's First Patrician was kidnapped by said villains.<br />(Apology to readers:  Pratchett really does induce long, complicated sentences from reviewers trying to describe his plots).<br />So, forget the plot.  Read this book because it's hysterically funny and because you can be the first to entertain your friends with songs from the Vampires' Temperance Union.	2004-02-05

I own several crockery cookbooks, but this one is my favorite, perhaps because the author uses lots of herbs and spices in her recipes, so the dishes don't turn out as bland and watery as they sometimes do with recipes from other, similar books.<br />In &quot;Crockery Favorites,&quot; you'll find many recipes for soups, stews, and chili that will keep you warm on a frigid winter's day.  All you need as an accompaniment is a crisp loaf of home-made bread and a side of vegetables.<br />A sampling of the recipes I've tried and liked:<br />---Beef and Winter Vegetable Stew:  parsnips and baby limas are the surprise ingredients in this stew.<br />---Turkey chowder:  this one is good for the remains of the Thanksgiving turkey.<br />---Beef Stroganoff:  have the cognac or brandy at the ready!<br />---Pot Roast Smothered in Onions:  and cooking apples.  I also add a handful of small potatoes.<br />---Porketta:  this recipe was invented by the author's son and is very easy to make.  I am also delighted by the name of this dish which brings to mind the author's robust portrait on the book cover's end-flap.<br />There are vegetarian dishes and crock pot desserts in this book, but most of the recipes involve some kind of meat.

I did, and decided to switch over and read seed catalogues until it was light out again.<br />Lots of things howl in this vividly illustrated book:  the Wild Hunt; Black Shuck, the dog with eyes as big as saucers; and various melancholy or angry ghosts.  The stories are loosely connected as in a history of what people believed and saw, or thought they saw, with a special concentration on medieval Europe.  Death is on every page as an illustration or in the text.  There are plague victims, abandoned babies (one of the most horrific revenants in the book is an 'utburd'--&quot;from the old Norse word for 'child carried outside'&quot;), sisters murdered by sisters, sons murdered by mothers, and whole armies that rise up after death and fight again on a haunted battlefield.<br />I had to cover some of the illustrations with my hand before I could read the accompanying text.  Time-Life series books always have great pictures, and this book from the 'Enchanted World' series is no exception.<br />Many customs surrounding the death of a loved one are explained here, including the consequences for not following them.  Familial hauntings seemed to be particularly common in Scandinavia, and no matter how well the ghost was loved in life, it always returned full of anger and malevolence.  So sprinkle salt on the corpse's chest, put a cup of milk on the windowsill, and bury your dead with its favorite possessions--or it might come back to fetch them.<br />Some of the most familiar English ghost stories are included here, including the bride of Marwell Hall who accidentally locked herself inside a chest while playing hide-and-seek on her wedding night.  The ghosts and monsters of the Tower of London and Glamis Castle are paraded in all of their gory (and sometimes headless) cerements.  Skulls scream in Burton Agnes Hall.  Heads roll down a deserted pathway and snap at late travelers.<br />I highly recommend this book to ghost-story aficionados.  Just don't read it at night.down a deserted pathway and snap at late travelers.<br />I highly recommend this book to ghost-story aficionados.  Just don't read it at night.	2004-02-03

This makes sense, I suppose, since the author Geoff Yeates is an architect.  However, if you're looking for a book with one scary story after another, &quot;Cambridge College Ghosts&quot; is probably not for you.<br />The book is a short, lively history of Cambridge University and its colleges, with detailed architectural descriptions of the buildings, and lively anecdotes about its residents, living and deceased.  If you are planning a trip to Cambridge, this book would make a good guide to the college buildings, although the one map is small and hard to read without a magnifying glass.  The black-and-white photographs and drawings of buildings and architectural details are interesting, sometimes even eerie.<br />Author Yeates didn't exactly have an easy time collecting this book's ghostly anecdotes.  Here are some of the replies he received from potential information sources:<br />&quot;I regret that we have no ghosts in our cupboard.&quot;<br />&quot;We have not as yet experienced anything spiritual.  I shall let you know if it changes!&quot;<br />&quot;We...have no history of any ghosts connected with the property (apart from the Holy Ghost which we very much believe in).&quot;<br />Nevertheless Yeates persevered and came up with a few supernatural sightings, a rector who met a ghost that predicted his own death and that of a colleague, the disposition of Oliver Cromwell's head, the (possibly) original skeleton in the cupboard, and quite a bit of information about Cambridge's own Society for Psychical Research which was founded in 1882 by three dons of Trinity College.<br />The most frightening story in this collection is fictional, but was written by Arthur Gray, who was the last master of Jesus College to be elected for life.  &quot;The Everlasting Club&quot; was part of a collection of stories that Gray published under the pseudonym 'Ingulphus,&quot; and was entitled, &quot;Tedious Brief Tales of Granta and Gramarye.&quot;<br />Short though it is, this book contains one astounding omission.

In most of these SF novels, Norton describes the ancient Forerunner ruins as vast, underground high technology installations where ordinary human beings can be driven crazy just by the odd angles to the walls, the mazes and tunnels where they're always getting lost, or by the harmful emanations from the ancient and only partly understood machines.<br />In &quot;Forerunner&quot; (1981) and its sequel, &quot;Forerunner: The Second Venture&quot; (1985), author Norton veers off the super technology highway and onto the mythical road of nature/nurture goddesses.  All of a sudden, Forerunners (at least one of them) bear a strong resemblance to Ceres, Persephone, and (if you follow the Witch World novels) Gunnora.  In Andre Norton's universe, there was more than one race that preceded humans into space.  I just wish that she had differentiated between the technology-based Forerunner civilizations, and the Forerunner civilization that is explicated in this novel, which seems very anti-technology.<br />&quot;Forerunner&quot; begins in the ancient port of Kuxortal, which has built and rebuilt itself upon the ruins of ancient and decayed civilizations.  The lowly Burrow-dwellers sometimes discover artifacts from the past as they tunnel beneath the current city's towers.<br />Simsa had been a runner and fetcher for an old Burrow-dweller, &quot;until the mists of the riverside burrow bit so far into Old One's crippled bones that her body at last gave up...&quot;  She buries her mentor, who had probably rescued Simsa off of a garbage heap as an infant.  The old cripple never revealed Simsa's origin to her, but it was obvious that the girl was different from any of the other Burrow-dwellers.  Simsa tries to hide her differences--her platinum hair combined with blue-black skin, but she must flee from her only known home when scavengers attempt to loot the treasures that Simsa's ancient mentor had purportedly hidden there.  The scavengers also consider Simsa part of the loot, but she fights her way free with the assistance of her retractable claws and her pet zorsal.<br />Zorsals are one of the best features of this book.  They are cute, bat-like creatures with four paws and feathery antennae.  Simsa is able to communicate with them on a very primitive thought-band, and they play an integral role in her adventure.<br />Now that Simsa has been driven from Ferwar's burrow, she attempts to sell her mentor's treasured artifacts to an off-world man who has come to Kuxortal in search of his missing brother.  He in turn persuades her to accompany him to the deadly Hard Hills where his historian-brother was last seen.<br />After a long, difficult journey through the desert, where Simsa and her zorsals almost perish, she and Thom, the outworlder reach the Hard Hills and discover an ancient, alien city.  It is here that Simsa learns of her true origin.<br />There are nice Norton touches in &quot;Forerunner:&quot; the zorsals; the underground healing pool; Simsa's hard and dangerous life in the Burrows; her difficult journey through the desert with Thom.  However, the plot is muddied up with too many villains--greedy Guild Lords and skyjackers ('jacks' in Norton's terminology), and too many variations on the nature of the Forerunners.<br />I also preferred the Simsa at the book's beginning to the Simsa at the end.<br />However, the zorsals were wonderful throughout.<br />Note:  &quot;Forerunner: the Defender&quot; has the same publication date (1981) as this novel, and I'm betting it's the same story under two different titles.fferences--her platinum hair combined with blue-black skin, but she must flee from her only known home when scavengers attempt to loot the treasures that Simsa's ancient mentor had purportedly hidden there.

It is here that Simsa learns of her true origin.<br />There are nice Norton touches in &quot;Forerunner:&quot; the zorsals; the underground healing pool; Simsa's hard and dangerous life in the Burrows; her difficult journey through the desert with Thom.  However, the plot is muddied up with too many villains--greedy Guild Lords and skyjackers ('jacks' in Norton's terminology), and too many variations on the nature of the Forerunners.  <br />I also preferred the Simsa at the book's beginning to the Simsa at the end.  <br />However, the zorsals were wonderful throughout.<br />Note:  &quot;Forerunner: the Defender&quot; has the same publication date (1981) as this novel, and I'm betting it's the same story under two different titles.	2004-01-28

Here is a brief description of the contents:<br />&quot;Dragon Scale Silver&quot; -- Norton uses the multiple birth theme again here, as she did so successfully in her Witch World trilogy about the Tregarth triplets, Kaththea, Kemoc, and Kyllan.  In this novella, a woman of witch-blood gives birth to the twins Elys and her brother Elyn, and does not long survive their entry into the world.  The twins are raised by the Wise Woman, Aufrica and their father, who trains both Elys and Elyn in arms-play.  The Dales are attacked by foreign invaders (as in Norton's 'Gryphon' trilogy, &quot;Year of the Unicorn,&quot; and &quot;Zarsthor's Bane&quot;), and the twins' father rides off to war.  Soon, Elyn follows him, but not before he has shared a drink with his twin sister in a special cup, fashioned by their deceased mother from dragon scale silver.  If the cup loses its luster while he is off to war, Elys will know that her twin brother is in danger.<br />Sure enough, after several seasons have passed the cup begins to tarnish. Elys must use both her skills as a warrior and as a witch to save her twin from an ancient curse.  Her only companion in her quest is Jervon, once Marshal of Horse at a keep that fell to the foreign invaders.<br />&quot;Dragon Scale Silver&quot; scintillates with Norton's eerie brand of magic, especially in her handling of the old, uncanny legend of the sealed window.<br />If you enjoy this novella, you can seek out the further adventures of Elys and Jervon in &quot;Gryphon in Glory,&quot; &quot;Gryphon's Eyrie,&quot; and &quot;Sword of Unbelief&quot; (in &quot;Lore of the Witch World&quot;).<br />&quot;Dream Smith&quot; -- In my opinion, Norton doesn't display her story-telling talents as well in an abbreviated format as she does in her novellas and novels.  However, &quot;Dream Smith&quot; and another short story, &quot;The Toads of Grimmerdale&quot; are rare and wonderful exceptions to this rule. In &quot;Dream Smith,&quot; her hero is handicapped so severely by an explosion at his father's forge that he must wear a mask and live away from the other villagers, including his family.  Many of Norton's most finely realized characters are misfits, handicapped, or otherwise rejected by society. In this story, both the hero and heroine have been cast off because of physical abnormalities.  The magic is delicate, almost wistful.  The happy ending is a bit contrived, but I wouldn't have had it any other way.<br />&quot;Amber out of Quayth&quot;--Ysmay, who was once chatelaine of the keep at Uppsdale, is now made to feel unwanted by her brother's new bride.  She yearns for her former responsibilities, even if it means she must marry a stranger who comes to town for a trade fair.  He in turn is attracted by her dowry: an old, caved-in amber mine.  Ysmay follows her new husband to the far north, to Quayth Keep and learns to her dismay that &quot;it is one of the ancient places which the Old Ones had the building of.&quot;  Witch World fans know what this might mean:  does Ysmay's new lord have dealings with certain Dark Powers?as and novels.

At an early age, she was forcibly separated from her brothers and taken to the Place of Silence to be trained in magic by the Wise Women of Estcarp.<br />In &quot;Three Against the Witch World&quot; (1965), the triplets escape from witch-ruled Estcarp to the magical land of Escore.  There, they accidentally destroy the false peace that had long abided between the great powers of Light and Dark.  &quot;Things awoke and gathered, and the land was troubled...&quot; and the three learn that they must fight with the forces of Light, or be utterly annihilated by the Dark.<br />Unfortunately, in &quot;Warlock of the Witch World&quot; (1967), Kaththea is wooed by the fair-seeming Dinzil, who is actually a creature of the Great Dark Ones.  She who was once a powerful witch is rescued by her brother, Kemoc, but because of her near-alliance with the Dark, she is stripped of her magic.  No longer can she communicate mind-to-mind with her brothers, nor perform the simplest spell of healing.<br />A witch without her magic is a very dangerous thing to be in Escore: a vessel waiting to be filled by the Dark.  In &quot;Sorceress of the Witch World&quot; (1968), Kaththea attempts to return over-mountain to Estcarp to seek help from the witches, but she is caught in an avalanche and then captured by a tribe of nomadic hunters.<br />Andre Norton is a scholar of Amerindian history and lore, and has incorporated her knowledge in many of her novels, e.g. &quot;Sioux Spacemen&quot; (1960), and &quot;The Beast Master&quot; (1959).  The dog-sleds and temporary dwellings of the Vupsall, the people who capture Kaththea, are yet another example of Norton's borrowings from history and anthropology, although this particular Escorian tribe also works metal (maybe a touch of Finno-Ugric, rather than Amerindian).<br />At any rate, this author's careful attention to detail will bring to life the dimly-lit interior of Utta, the Wisewoman's tent where Kaththea begins to reacquire the magic that was her birthright.<br />'Sorceress' completes the very fine trilogy of the adventures of Kemoc, Kyllan, and Kaththea, the three children of Earth-born warrior, Simon Tregarth and his witch-wife, Jaelithe.life the dimly-lit interior of Utta, the Wisewoman's tent where Kaththea begins to reacquire the magic that was her birthright. <br />'Sorceress' completes the very fine trilogy of the adventures of Kemoc, Kyllan, and Kaththea, the three children of Earth-born warrior, Simon Tregarth and his witch-wife, Jaelithe.	2004-01-23

Even Dorothy and Glinda the Good might shy away from stealing the red boots of the witch that the farmhouse did to land on.  This particular witch writes home:<br />\\"PS the privies here are DESGUSTING, they have them INDORES, so much for HIGEINE.\\"<br />Genua, the witches' destination, resembles a Dismal Swamp version of Disney World.  You'll be humming Disney tunes all the way through \\"Witches Abroad,\\" when you're not humming tunes from \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" or laughing hysterically.  You won't be able to stop yourself.<br />This book is even dedicated to song, or more precisely to all those people \\"who, after the publication of 'Wyrd Sisters,' deluged the author with their version of the words of 'The Hedgehog Song.'  Deary deary me...\\"<br />Along with the above-mentioned Wyrd Sisters, this tale has a fairy godmother who believes in, nay _orchestrates_ happy endings even if it means chopping off the hands and heads of folks who are inclined to be grumpy. (Doesn't that sound like something Walt Disney might have done?)  So when Granny, Nanny, Magrat, and Greebo make a splash landing in Genua, already tempery after a journey involving grandma-munching wolves, falling farmhouses, and larcenous riverboat gamblers---well, there's bound to be a confrontation.<br />You might want to read \\"Wyrd Sisters\\" before launching into \\"Witches Abroad,\\" although time doesn't exactly flow in a straight line on Pratchett's Discworld. (It flows over the edge of the world and down onto the elephants who are standing on top of the turtle.)  \\"Lords and Ladies\\" sort of loop-de-loops along after \\"Witches Abroad,\\" and then Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg pop up again in \\"Maskerade.\\"  I just read them in the order I get them, and ignore sequence.

They figure the dwarves are up to their old trick of turning lead into gold. The &quot;Ankh-Morpork Times&quot; ('the truth shall make you fred') is born almost by accident and soon it has a rival in the &quot;Inquirer,&quot; which publishes stories like 'Woman gives birth to codfish' and 'Elvis ate my gerbil.'<br />&quot;The Truth&quot; is a strongly plotted fantasy with serious messages about freedom of the press and ethical journalism. Of course, you're going to have to chuck your sanity out the window when reading one of Pratchett's Discworld books, most especially this one. It might be a good idea to chuck your theology, too. Who knows? If the Universe is infinite, maybe there is a Disc-shaped world somewhere, supported by four elephants on top of a turtle. Maybe their lawyers really are zombies (some excellent characterization here), and the &quot;Ankh-Morpork Times&quot; really has a teetotalling vampire as its press photographer---a vampire who turns to dust every time his flash goes off, and has to be revived with a piece of blutw&uuml;rst, a bit of dog meat, a drop of blood---whatever is at hand. Hopefully not blood since our Vampire, Otto has given up the b-word.<br />There is also a pair of very nasty villains named Mr. Pin and Mr. Tulip, who assume the disguises of Brother Upon-Which-the-Angels-Dance Pin and Sister Jennifer of The Little Flowers of Perpetual Annoyance in order to pursue a dog who might blab out what really happened on the morning when Ankh-Morpork's First Patrician was kidnapped by said villains.<br />(Apology to readers: Pratchett really does induce long, complicated sentences from reviewers who are trying to describe his plots).<br />So, forget the plot. Read this book because it's hysterically funny and because you can be the first to entertain your friends with songs from the Vampires' Temperance Union.	2004-01-15

If you haven't already read \\"Sabriel\\", you might want to put \\"Lirael\\" aside and begin at the beginning.  The middle book could stand alone, especially the story of Lirael herself, but you will miss nuances of the Philosophy and Geography of Death if you don't start with \\"Sabriel\\".  The only work I can compare this series to is Philip Pullman's \\"Golden Compass\\" trilogy, although I prefer Nix's magical world-building.  If I ever die and go to fantasy heaven, I hope it resembles his immense library beneath glacier and mountain, where each door opens into a separate mystery.  In the catacombs beneath the library, Lirael discovers how to turn herself into an ice otter or a barking owl, reads \\"The Book of Remembrance and Forgetting\\", and duels with the monstrous Stilken.<br />However, \\"Lirael\\" isn't just about Lirael.  Prince Sameth, heir apparent to Sabriel as the Old Kingdom's champion against evil necromancers, also comes of age in this volume.  There are plenty of evil necromancers to go around.  In fact, at the end of this book, it appears as though they are winning the war to turn the Old Kingdom into a kingdom of the dead.<br />One fault should be noted. The two main characters spend too much text feeling sorry for themselves.  Lirael pursues an impossible dream, while Prince Sameth tries to escape from an impossible nightmare.  I think the author's editor must have read \\"Sabriel\\" and said, \\"Garth, this is a great fantasy but your heroine, Sabriel is pretty darn self-sufficient.  Readers can't relate to that.  You need to make your characters more vulnerable.\\"  So that's exactly what Nix did in Volume Two.  Vulnerability often shades over into self-pity in \\"Lirael\\"---too often for my liking.  It's not enough of an annoyance to bypass this fantasy.  Hopefully, in the yet-to-be-published &quot;Abhorsen&quot;, Lirael and Prince Sameth will stop whining and take up the burden of defending the Old Kingdom.  Lirael is already headed in that direction, along with her friend the Disreputable Dog.<br />Garth, I advise you to stop listening to your editor.  You were pitch-perfect in \\"Sabriel\\".

The meteorologists in Washington D.C. assumed that the storm would dissipate in the cold waters of the Atlantic, as had happened to all north-bound hurricanes since the Great September Gale devastated New England in 1815.<br />According to the author, no one could have been prepared for the 1938 storm's speed and ferocity.  Sweeping northward from Cape Hatteras, building tremendous momentum as it advanced, the hurricane raced over six hundred miles in only twelve hours.  Only the captain of the 'Carinthia,' a small 20,000 ton luxury cruiser that weathered the ferocious brawl 150 miles north of Florida might have given warning.  He did radio to shore that his barometer had dropped &quot;almost an inch to 27.85 in less than an hour.  It was one of the lowest readings ever recorded in the North Atlantic.&quot;<br />Author Scotti interviewed many survivors of this ferocious storm, and includes the story of Katharine Hepburn who had to escape her seaside house through a dining room window and then battle her way to higher ground:<br />&quot;When the Hepburns reached high ground, they looked back.  [Their house] which had endured tide and wind since the 1870's, pirouetted slowly and sailed away.&quot;<br />Many folks were not as fortunate as the Hepburns.  The storm surge was so sudden and so high many houses were completely inundated before their inhabitants could escape.  One survivor saw a submerged house leap twenty-five feet into the air and explode.  Another watched as a school bus containing his children was overtaken by the onrushing water.  Others climbed to the top floors of their homes, then clung desperately to pieces of their roof as their houses washed away beneath them.<br />It is estimated that 682 people died and another 1,754 were seriously wounded by the 'Long Island Express.'  Scotti focuses on a few representative stories, and relates tantalizing fragments of many others.<br />If you would like to read a first-hand account of the 'Long Island Express,' September 21, 1938 was also the day that Everett S. Allen, recent college graduate and future author of \\"A Wind to Shake the World,\\" began his first `real' job as a reporter for the New Bedford `Standard Times.'

It is narrated by Seyonne who was once a mighty wizard and Warden against demonkind, then a slave to Prince Aleksander, then the savior of demonkind and a wizard-in-exile, and finally in &quot;Restoration,&quot; a mighty winged warrior who fights for the deposed heir-apparent to a fantastical Arabian Nights Empire.<br />&quot;Restoration&quot; develops logically from the interaction of its two main characters, Aleksander and Seyonne, especially after Aleksander is accused of killing his father, the King and is deposed from his rightful throne.  With Seyonne's assistance, Aleksander escapes from the usurper and then suffers humiliation, defeat, and near-death in his quest to regain what rightfully belongs to him.  Author Berg believes in building character through suffering, and Aleksander loses everything, including his princely arrogance and most of his warriors.<br />Meanwhile Seyonne has his own internal demon to battle (joined to him in &quot;Revelation&quot;--you really, really need to read this trilogy in the correct order).  He must also make his way to a fortress of profound darkness, where a wizard who frightens even the demons has been imprisoned, almost since the beginning of history.  Seyonne meets the prisoner in a dream, and the old man seems harmless.  When he finally enters the fortress, all Nyel, the old prisoner wants to do is help Seyonne find his own true form.<br /><br />Seyonne realizes that he can help his friend Aleksander far more as a powerful winged warrior, rather than in his current human form.  Thus begins his slow seduction to the beauty and utility of absolute power.<br /><br />This third book in Berg's trilogy has prodigious battles, hair's-breadth escapes, and journeys to locales from her previous two novels, including the land of the demons.  It is a vast, fabulous landscape and a pleasure to revisit, but the plot has a tendency to wander, bifurcate, and even lose this reader completely.  This book definitely seems to bring the trilogy to an end, but I'm still in doubt about the fate of demonkind.<br />Seyonne spends almost the whole of &quot;Revelation&quot; in helping them escape from their frozen hell, but in &quot;Restoration&quot; all we get are a few guest appearances.  So this trilogy comes to an untidy end with the dissipation of the demons, but it is still a great and glorious read.<br /><br />Highly recommended.luding the land of the demons.

This dark, water-bound environment is often a river of rebirth for Norton's heroes.  In &quot;Warlock of the Witch World (Witch World #5)&quot; the hero, Kemoc is guided through a watery underworld by the amphibious, amorphous Orsya who defies her own people to aid him in his quest.<br />Kemoc Tregarth was born one of three triplets.  His birth-sister Kaththea was gifted with witchery.  His brother, Kyllan became a warrior.  Kemoc himself was gifted with wisdom, but as he states it, &quot;...my wisdom consists in knowing that I know very little, though the thirst for learning has ever been in me.&quot;<br />At the very least, you probably need to read &quot;Three Against the Witch World&quot; (1965) as a precursor to 'Warlock' (1967), in order to learn about the hidden land of Escore, the magical sister-state of witch-ruled Estcarp that lies to the forbidden East in \\"trembling balance between the forces of Light and those of the Dark.\\"  When Kaththea, Kemoc, and Kyllan flee to Escore, they accidentally destroy the false peace that had long abode there between the great powers of Light and Dark.  &quot;Things awoke and gathered, and the land was troubled...&quot; and the three learn that they must fight with the forces of Light, or be utterly annihilated by the Dark.<br />Kemoc sets out to win allies among the Krogan, who made their homes in the lakes, rivers, and waterways of Escore.  When he returns from this failed mission, there are many other battles to be fought in the now-troubled land.  During one such engagement, Kemoc is wounded and is almost captured by minions of the Dark, but is saved by the Krogan maid, Orsya.  When Kemoc finally reaches the safety of the Valley of Green Silences, he discovers that his birth-sister Kaththea has ridden off to the stronghold of an apparent ally, Dinzil.  However, Kemoc suspects that the fair-seeming man who wooed his sister is actually a creature of the Great Dark Ones.<br />Off he goes on another quest into the magic-troubled land, where he meets with the gnarled Moss Wives, and Loskeetha of the Garden of Stones, Reader of Sands.  Loskeetha shows Kemoc three separate futures--all which end in the death of his birth-sister, Kaththea, twice by his own hand!<br />A greatly troubled Kemoc continues his search for Kaththea, with the help of his web-fingered, silver-haired friend, Orsya.<br />This is an eerie, compelling fantasy with many allusions (intended or not) to Wagner's &quot;Rheingold.&quot;  It doesn't have a happy, fairytale ending and you must certainly read the sequel, &quot;Sorceress of the Witch World&quot; (1968) in order to experience a good, satisfying thumping of the Great Dark Ones.<br />Andre Norton is a powerful mythmaker and world-builder, and her fantasies concerning the triplets Kemoc, Kaththea, and Kyllan (&quot;Three Against the Witch World,&quot; &quot;Warlock of the Witch World,&quot; and &quot;Sorceress of the Witch World&quot;) do not suffer in comparison with Ursula K.

The time frame is roughly the same as &quot;The Crystal Gryphon,&quot; but I'd rate this book a bit below &quot;The Crystal Gryphon&quot; if only because the hero and heroine are not as likeable.<br />Brixia, who was once the lady of a Hall in High Hallack now hunts and scavenges the deserted, post-invasion farmland of the Dales. Her only companion is the cat Uta.<br />Brixia and Uta are drawn into the Waste where Light and Dark Magic still exist, on a search for Zarsthor's Bane. Brixia discovers a place of Green Magic while under attack by one of the many loathsome packs of creatures that inhabit the Waste. Ultimately, she rescues two men (a wounded lord and his squire), but not before Brixia survives a vintage Norton combat between the forces of Light and Dark.<br />The banquet scene where Zarsthor confronts his Bane is especially eery, and tingling with Norton's special brand of magical description.<br />Well worth reading; in fact, a 'must' for Witch World fans.	2004-01-09

But Yonan feels a compulsion to rescue the sword hilt from its imprisoning stone, and so the original wielder of the Sword of Ice is able to reincarnate himself within Yonan. Yonan-now-Tolar forges a magical blade for his sword, rescues his friend Uruk of the Ax from a pillar of ice, and together they hurtle back through time to refight the Lost Battle of Witch World.<br />Before they bid farewell to the present, Yonan-now-Tolar and Uruk rescue Yonan's childhood companion, the untrained witch, Crytha from the filthy, claustrophobic burrows of the Rasti.<br />Crytha then narrates the third story of the trilogy, &quot;Sword of Shadows.&quot;<br />An untrained witch is a very dangerous thing to be in Escore: a vessel waiting to be filled with the wrong kind of magic---which is exactly what happens to Crytha. She is put under a strong compulsion to obey an evil female magician named Laidan, who is plotting to reincarnate her lover, an adept of the darkest shadow who originally perished in the Lost Battle. (Evil females in Norton stories are easily identified by their scarlet lips and wanton behavior.)<br />How Crytha manages to foil the adepts of the Dark, with unexpected assistance from one of the Great Ones who had withdrawn from Witch World after the Lost Battle is the essence of &quot;Sword of Shadows.&quot;<br />My only reason for withholding a star from my review is the very loosely constructed plot of &quot;Trey of Swords.&quot; I never did quite comprehend why the Lost Battle of Witch World had to be refought. A more favorable outcome to the ancient battle didn't seem to change anything in 'modern-day' Escore---at least not by book's end. The blurb on the cover states that &quot;the fate of witch world hangs in the Balance!&quot; but I've read &quot;Trey of Swords&quot; at least twice now and still haven't figured out what sort of awfulness fate had in store, if Yonan and Crytha hadn't done their thing.<br />Read &quot;Trey of Swords&quot; because Norton tells an engrossing story of Good versus Evil magic in fabled Escore.hadow who originally perished in the Lost Battle.

He has written 101 books on IT subjects, and this title is one of his earlier books, first published in 1975.<br />Martin received a Pulitzer Prize nomination for his book, &quot;The Wired Society: A Challenge for Tomorrow,&quot; based on his predictions about technology. In September 2002, Computerworld ranked Dr. Martin the fourth most influential person in the computer industry (and also one of the richest, at least in the field of consultancy).<br />I've worked extensively with his consulting associates from James Martin &amp; Company (now called Headstrong, and recently merged with TechSpan), especially in the areas of project management and data base design.  This book was our bible back in the 80s and 90s.<br />&quot;Computer Data-Base Organization&quot; is a lucid, well-organized guide to relational data base design, dated only by its lack of reference to object/relational frameworks.  Check out &quot;Object-Oriented Analysis and Design&quot; by Martin and Odell for O-O made simple.<br />The principles of data base organization in this book, e.g. the need for independence between physical and logical design, the optimization of design for access time versus the complexity of data relationships are still valid.  In spite of the new storage devices, software techniques, and new types of data bases that have come onto the market since this book was published,  you can still get a solid grounding from this book, especially if you are new to the concept of what a data base is and what it should be able to do for you.<br />It is sad to note that for every well-designed data base that is currently in production, there are probably ninety-nine that are badly designed and barely limping along because the developers didn't understand principles in this book.	2004-01-08

It reminded me very much what Charles de Lint calls &quot;mythic fiction,&quot; because it's basically a young adult story about a girl's rite of passage that incorporates elements of myth and folktale.  No dragons, here, although there is a Pooka, the billy-blind, the Black Dog, a boggart, the Wild Hunt, and many (almost too many) ghosts.<br /><br />None of the mythic stuff kicks in until Jenny Gluckstein's mother marries an English biologist and Jenny is forced to relocate from New York City to an ancient, run-down farm in Dorset.  She acquires two stepbrothers along with her stepfather, boggart, etc., and meanwhile her beloved Mr. Cat is forced to spend six months in quarantine.<br />I'd feel the same way Jenny did if I were forced to temporarily swap my cat for something that titters nastily under an ancient bathtub that fills up with burping, sidewalk-colored water-- when the plumbing is working at all.  Not to mention having to attend the Sherborne School for Girls where everyone HAS TO WEAR A UNIFORM.<br />Jenny does settle in, but it's a long grumpy, kvetch.  The turning point in her attitude comes during her shift on a boggart patrol in the kitchen (also known as the Arctic Circle) with her young step-brother, Julian.  Something has been smashing eggs, making the food in the refrigerator go bad, and generally making a nuisance of itself.  Jenny and Julian are deep in a game of Snakes and Ladders when the boggart finally shows up:<br />&quot;He was dressed like a cross between the Seven Dwarfs [sic] and Robin Hood, in a kind of loose red smock...and heavy little boots, ankle-high.&quot;  Jenny thought they (the shoes) might be Doc Martens, except she didn't think they made them in boggart sizes.<br />Jenny and Julian solve the mystery of what the boggart really wants.  Mr. Cat comes out of quarantine and falls in love with a ghostly Persian.  Jenny makes a really good friend at school, and the ghostly Persian's owner finally makes her appearance.<br />Now Jenny must solve the deeper, darker mystery of why her ethereal friend, Tamsin who 'stopped' 300 years past, cannot find peace.<br />All of Beagle's characters are wonderfully human, including Mr. Cat, and most especially grumpy Jenny, and her pesky, lovable stepbrother, Julian.  This would make a great read for anyone who is forced to pack up and move away from friends and school, and try to make a new life with a new family.  In spite of all of its supernatural goings-on, &quot;Tamsin&quot; is not particularly scary--just Beagle at his most poignant.<br />I took away one star because the ending was a bit of a let-down.

This dark, water-bound environment is often a river of rebirth for Norton's heroes.  In &quot;Warlock of the Witch World&quot; the hero, Kemoc is guided through a watery underworld by the amphibious, amorphous Orsya who defies her own people to aid him in his quest.<br />Kemoc Tregarth was born one of three triplets.  His birth-sister Kaththea was gifted with witchery.  His brother, Kyllan became a warrior.  Kemoc himself was gifted with wisdom, but as he states it, &quot;...my wisdom consists in knowing that I know very little, though the thirst for learning has ever been in me.&quot;<br />At the very least, you probably need to read &quot;Three Against the Witch World&quot; (1965) as a precursor to 'Warlock' (1967), in order to learn about the hidden land of Escore, the magical sister-state of witch-ruled Estcarp that lies to the forbidden East in \\"trembling balance between the forces of Light and those of the Dark.\\"  When Kaththea, Kemoc, and Kyllan flee to Escore, they accidentally destroy the false peace that had long abode there between the great powers of Light and Dark.  &quot;Things awoke and gathered, and the land was troubled...&quot; and the three learn that they must fight with the forces of Light, or be utterly annihilated by the Dark.<br />Kemoc sets out to win allies among the Krogan, who made their homes in the lakes, rivers, and waterways of Escore.  When he returns from this failed mission, there are many other battles to be fought in the now-troubled land.  During one such engagement, Kemoc is wounded and is almost captured by minions of the Dark, but is saved by the Krogan maid, Orsya.  When Kemoc finally reaches the safety of the Valley of Green Silences, he discovers that his birth-sister Kaththea has ridden off to the stronghold of a apparent ally, Dinzil.  However, Kemoc suspects that the fair-seeming man who wooed his sister is actually a creature of the Great Dark Ones.<br />Off he goes on another quest into the magic-troubled land, where he meets with the gnarled Moss Wives, and Loskeetha of the Garden of Stones, Reader of Sands.  Loskeetha shows Kemoc three separate futures--all which end in the death of his birth-sister, Kaththea, and twice by his own hand!<br />A greatly troubled Kemoc continues his search for Kaththea, with the help of his web-fingered, silver-haired friend, Orsya.<br />This is an eerie, compelling fantasy with many allusions (intended or not) to Wagner's &quot;Rheingold.&quot;  It doesn't have a happy, fairytale ending, and you must certainly read the sequel, &quot;Sorceress of the Witch World&quot; (1968) in order to experience a good, satisfying thumping of the Great Dark Ones.<br />Andre Norton is a powerful mythmaker and world-builder, and her three fantasies concerning the triplets Kemoc, Kaththea, and Kyllan (&quot;Three Against the Witch World,&quot; &quot;Warlock of the Witch World,&quot; and &quot;Sorceress of the Witch World&quot;) do not suffer in comparison with Ursula K.

Lesser authors have butted into the series, presumably with Norton's permission since this remarkable Gandalf Grand Master of Fantasy and Nebula Grand Master is still writing (her first novel was published in 1934, her latest fantasy in 2002).<br />One Solar Queen rip-off to avoid at all costs is &quot;Redline: the Stars.&quot;<br />Norton's Solar Queen stories are told from the viewpoint of Dane Thorson, an apprentice-Cargo Master who is introduced as a &quot;lanky, very young man in an ill-fitting Trader's tunic.&quot;  Most of this author's heroes and heroines are young, uncertain of themselves, shy, with a tendency to trip over their own enthusiasms and load themselves up with guilt at the slightest opportunity.  They are very likeable and their adventures are narrated in remarkably lean prose with just the right touch of description.<br />After ten years of schooling, orphan Dane Thorson is assigned via a computer analysis of his psychological profile--not to a safe berth on a sleek Company-run starship that his classmates were vying for--but to a battered tramp of a Free Trader. To say that the 'Solar Queen' &quot;lacked a great many refinements and luxurious fittings which the Company ships boasted&quot; was an understatement.  But she was a tightly-run ship and what she lacked in refinement, she made up for in adventure.  Dane soon settles in under Cargo Master Van Rycke and learns &quot;to his dismay what large gaps unfortunately existed in his training.&quot;<br /><br />Sometimes I just want to give Dane a big hug.<br />The crew of the 'Solar Queen' risk their meager capital in a gamble at a Survey auction, and win trading rights to a barely explored planet with the unlucky name of Limbo.  When they view a microfilm (okay, the technology is a bit dated in these books) of their new prize, it appears as though they have purchased ten years of trading rights to a planet that was burned to cinder during the heyday of the mysterious Forerunners, who predated humans in space.<br />Just when the Queen's fortune seems to be at its lowest ebb, a tough-looking archeologist shows up who is supposedly an expert on Forerunner artifacts, and charters her for a voyage to Limbo.<br />It might have been better for the free traders if her captain had kept his ship planeted and declared bankruptcy after the disastrous Survey auction.<br />&quot;Plague Ship&quot; takes the crew of the 'Solar Queen' to Sargol, where the enigmatic feline natives seem very reluctant to trade away their fabulous scented gemstones.  When Dane Thorson discovers an herb that the Salariki are willing to swap for their gems, he fears that his eagerness to make a trade breakthrough might have poisoned a native child.  That becomes the least of his worries when the 'Solar Queen' blasts off from Sargol with an invisible, undetectable stowaway that would brand the free traders anathema to all inhabited worlds.<br />Both of these Solar Queen novels are prime representatives of Norton's lean action-packed brand of story-telling.  If you haven't read them since you were a teen-ager, I urge you to try them again.  For a few pleasant hours, you will be immersed in the adventures of a likeable, feisty band of free traders on exotic, carefully-drawn alien worlds.Van Rycke and learns &quot;to his dismay what large gaps unfortunately existed in his training.&quot;  <BR> <BR>Sometimes I just want to give Dane a big hug.<br />The crew of the 'Solar Queen' risk their meager capital in a gamble at a Survey auction, and win trading rights to a barely explored planet with the unlucky name of Limbo.

The 15th century castle had most recently been the home of the terrifying magician, Maleger who had died seventeen years before this story begins, either as a suicide or a murder victim.  His decomposed corpse was found floating down the Rhine, identifiable only through his jewelry and other personal effects.  The heirs to Castle Skull are a wealthy Belgian financier, and a vain, ageing actor, both associates of Maleger during the South African diamond rush.<br />The Versailles Treaty that ended World War I left Germany impoverished and embittered, and smoldering with the short-lived, decadent culture of the Weimar Republic.  However, Carr chooses to ignore most of post-WWI German reality.  His 1920s Germany is populated with jolly hikers, beer drinkers, and the sinister Prussian, Herr Baron Sigmund von Arnheim--&quot;[he] was...savagely gay, and his almost invisible blond moustache had been waxed until the points stood out like the whiskers of a cat.&quot;<br />Okay, so Herr Baron doesn't click his heels, but he does bow from the hip, has &quot;a cropped skull...eyes of a chill, greenish hue,&quot; and dueling scars.<br />There is also a cast of rich, decadent, and/or eccentric Americans, British, French, and Belgians who inhabit a mansion across the Rhine from Castle Skull, most of whom are suspected, in turn, of torching the actor, Alison after shooting him three times with a Mauser.<br />Enter the suave, Mephistophelean M. Henri Bencolin, 'juge d'instruction' of the Seine, the head of the Paris police and &quot;the most dangerous man in Europe.&quot;  He and Baron von Arnheim had played a deadly game of spy-versus-spy during WWI, and now both are invited to solve the case of the flaming 'danse macabre' on the ramparts of Castle Skull.<br />The cigar-smoking, poker-playing Duchess who owns the mansion across the river from Castle Skull calls her two detectives 'Glass-eye' (did I mention von Arnheim's monocle?) and 'Devil-face,'  although M. Bencolin is actually at his most human in this story, in spite of his morbid surroundings.<br />The setting for the final denouement is a wonderfully grotesque banquet in Castle Skull that will remind you very much of Poe's &quot;The Masque of the Red Death.&quot;  I won't tell you which detective, Prussian or Parisian, ultimately solves the mystery, but the penultimate chapter of &quot;Castle Skull&quot; is called &quot;The Laughter of Von Arnheim.&quot;<br />The ultimate chapter is called &quot;The Laughter of Bencolin.&quot;ll calls her two detectives 'Glass-eye' (did I mention von Arnheim's monocle?) and 'Devil-face,'  although M.

So I say to you, even you who live in the city of Paris, when your fire burns low by night, and you hear a gentle tapping of fingers at the window-pane, do not open your door to this supposed traveller, who...<br />_________________________________________________________________<br />Thus &quot;It Walks by Night&quot; begins on a note of supernatural horror.  It the first of more than 70 novels by Carr, and the first of his mysteries featuring the suave, Mephistophelean M. Henri Bencolin, 'juge d'instruction' of the Seine, the head of the Paris police and &quot;the most dangerous man in Europe.&quot;<br />Carr began his writing career, at the age of twenty-five, with his Inspector Bencolin mysteries. M. Bencolin was even spotted in some of Carr's earlier college stories published in the school newspaper, &quot;The Haverfordian.&quot;  (It may surprise you to learn that John Dickson Carr was American).<br /><br />&quot;It Walks by Night&quot; really begins when the police burst into the card room of a sinister Parisian gambling establishment, and spot the severed head of the Duc de Saligny staring at them from the centre of the empty room.  The remainder of his body is kneeling on the carpet, as though he had been waiting for his executioner's blow.<br />This is Carr's first mystery and also his first 'locked room' mystery, for which he became justifiably famous. Both doors of the card room were being watched by the police, including M. Bencolin, himself. The window to the card room was absolutely inaccessible and had not been entered, and there were no secret passages by which an entrance could be made through the walls. Yet within the space of ten minutes the executioner had entered the room, had severed the Duc de Saligny's head from his torso, and had escaped without leaving a clue and without having been seen by anyone.<br />Hashish, hysterical women, a murderous ex-husband escaped from the insane asylum, and several love triangles (actually one of them is a pentagon) feature prominently in this story of a bride whose husband is beheaded in a gaming establishment on their wedding night:  her &quot;eyes had the bright shine of terror as she stared at the thing that lay at her feet:  the severed head of the Duc de Saligny!&quot;<br />As is common in Carr's M. Bencolin stories, &quot;It Walks by Night&quot; pays homage to Poe, most specifically his story &quot;The Cask of Amontillado.&quot;<br />In his Bencolin novels, Carr seems fond of spectacularly gory murders and lurid settings for his Satanic detective. The American, Jeff Marly (Bencolin's muscular Watson) states that in Bencolin's hands, &quot;a thousand facets came glittering out of the revolving jewel of Paris--lights and shadows, perfume and danger...abbey, brothel, and guillotine.&quot;  This story takes place in Paris in 1927 in an atmosphere of hysteria, jazz, a hint of werewolves and impossible murders, ambergris-scented rooms, and a beautiful woman looking up into Jeff's match-flame:  &quot;Except for a kimono over one shoulder, she was unclothed, a breathless mystery of flesh and shadow.&quot;<br />A breathless mystery, indeed.uld be made through the walls.

This encyclopedia contains nearly a thousand illustrated entries covering eighty breeds of domestic cats, thirty-six species of wild cats, plus articles on feline anatomy, behavior, biology, folklore, history, literature and art.<br />Other sections list &quot;The 100 Best Cat Books,&quot; cat films, cat societies, and cat welfare organizations.  One of my favorite entries is a list of authors and their cats, and their quotations about cats.  For instance, Brian Aldiss and his cats, Macram&eacute;, Yum-Yum, Foxie, Jackson, and Nickie list the two things cats cannot stand:  &quot;The wretched Door, the horrid Fence.&quot;<br />The one deliberate omission in this encyclopedia is the subject of feline veterinary care.  A good reference for this sort of information is &quot;The Cornell Book of Cats,&quot; edited by Mordecai Siegal.<br />Morris, a trained zoologist, was the curator of mammals at the London Zoo from 1959 to 1971, where he was responsible for the largest collection of wild felines in the world. He has also authored other popular works on zoology, including &quot;The Naked Ape&quot; and &quot;Catwatching.&quot;<br />As might be expected from his background, the author's entries on feline behavior are some of the most interesting in the encyclopedia.  Morris states that cats have a much greater acoustic range than dogs or humans, especially in their ability to hear high-pitched sounds.  Cats prefer to hunt by stealth and need to be able to detect the ultrasonic squeaking of their prey.<br />I'll never forget the time I accidentally shut one of my cats in the room with me when I was practicing my violin.  I happened to turn around and there was Calvin, pressing his enormous, furry body against the door, a piteous look in his eye.  After reading this encyclopedia, I prefer to blame his behavior on his enhanced acoustic range rather than taking it as a commentary on my musical ability.  After all, Calvin probably knew that violin strings used to be made of sheepgut, not catgut as is popularly supposed.  Morris believes the term 'catgut' replaced 'sheepgut' because of the noises some people made while scraping on the strings.<br />As to why I turned around and saw him there, read Morris's entry on feline ESP.<br />'Cat World' is filled with feline anecdotes, both repeatable and some that are almost too bizarre to believe.  Be sure to check out the entry on P.T. Barnum's 'cherry-colored cat,' and the story of what happened to the great English novelist Thomas Hardy's heart--coupled with the mysterious disappearance of his beloved cat, Cobby.as a commentary on my musical ability.

Ash-Tree Press's &quot;A Pleasing Terror&quot; (2001), contains the complete and heavily annotated supernatural writings of MRJ, and no true Monty fan should be without it.<br />The next best collection, &quot;Casting the Runes and Other Stories&quot; edited by Michael Cox, contains most of MRJ's supernatural stories and is quite a bit cheaper than &quot;A Pleasing Terror.&quot;<br />The following stories are included in &quot;A Thin Ghost and others&quot;:<br />&quot;The Residence at Whitminster&quot;--Dr. Ashton, Dean of Whitminster, himself childless, attempts to raise his wife's sister's orphaned son.  He also takes in the Viscount Saul, the Earl of Kildonan's heir, who is a youth of rather morbid disposition.  As the story opens, the orphaned Frank is dying of what appears to be brain fever, brought on by a great fright.  Lord Saul is overtaken by a fit of laughter when he hears that Frank is dying.  However, he does not laugh for long.  Many years after the sudden deaths of Frank and Lord Saul, a new family takes residence in the prebendal house at Whitminster.  Miss Oldys, niece to the family, discovers a scrying glass that once belonged to the sinister Viscount Saul.<br />&quot;The Diary of Mr Poynter&quot;--A book collector finds a sample of fabric in an old diary and decides to have it reproduced as curtains for his bedroom.<br />&quot;An Episode of Cathedral History&quot;--Mr. Lake is deputed to examine the archives of the Cathedral of Southminster, and is curious to see what the ancient building looks like at night.  He hears the tale of a rather plain altar-tomb and what transpired when a Victorian Dean attempted to move it.<br />&quot;The Story of a Disappearance and an Appearance&quot;--This is the only one of MRJ's stories that was specifically set over the Christmas holiday, even though he wrote many of his stories to be read at Christmas.  The sudden, mysterious disappearance of his uncle forces a young man to cancel his previous holiday engagements and join the search that is in progress for his relative, who was a rather unlikeable rector.  This story features a rather grisly Punch and Judy show, and an equally horrible Christmas service in the Rector's former church.<br />&quot;Two Doctors&quot;--Dr. Abell and Dr. Quinn (think 'Abel and Cain') both live and practice in the same parish.  Dr. Abell appears to be a dabbler in the supernatural, and blames Dr. Quinn for the loss of his patients.  Dr. Quinn begins to have horrible nightmares about a man who is struggling to break free of a chrysalis.  He believes that the nightmares are brought about by his old bed linen, so he buys new linen that is &quot;marked in thread with a coronet and a bird.&quot;  When Dr. Quinn is found smothered in his bed, the ghastly origin of the new linen comes to light.ically set over the Christmas holiday, even though he wrote many of his stories to be read at Christmas.

MRJ engulfs his reader in quaint British dialects in this story of a prayer book that would not stay shut.<br />&quot;A Neighbour's Landmark&quot;-- A gentleman spends a wet August afternoon in his host's library and discovers an old pamphlet with two lines from a country song, &quot;That which walks in Betton Wood/ Knows why it walks or why it cries.&quot; When the weather clears, he explores the part of his friend's property that used to be called 'Betton Wood.'<br />&quot;A View from a Hill&quot;--A pair of field-glasses made by an old and rather unlikeable watch-maker reveal peculiar landscape features, including a gibbet and something hanging from it.

Since Sharyn Bass's book has quite a lot of information on showing Coonies, you need to be aware of changes to the breed standards (or judges' preferences) if you're planning to show your own cat.  The CFA and the Maine Coon Breeders and Fanciers Association (MCBFA) websites are probably the best places to research current Maine Coon breed standards.<br />The chapter on &quot;Health Care&quot; is not specific to Maine Coons and is also a bit dated, for instance in its treatment of Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP).  There is actually a vaccine for this disease now, although the extent of protection provided by it is debatable.<br />An important omission in this book is a discussion of hereditary defects known to occasionally occur in Maine Coons.  These include hip dysplasia, patellar luxation, cardiomyopathy and white-linked deafness.  Two of my six Maine Coons have slight heart murmurs, and the vet informs me that the older of the two will have to start taking heart medication within the year.<br />Bass presents good, general purpose information on feeding, caring for, and breeding cats.  There are detailed instructions on how to construct a queening box, which we followed, although matters didn't quite work out according to the book.  Our queen ignored the box and had her litter under our bedspread.<br />One final quibble concerns Bass's photograph of a Maine Coon trying to use a litter box that was meant for smaller cats.  His hindquarters and tail are hanging over the edge of the box, which negates the purpose of the whole thing, since deposits tend to end up on the floor.  We learned this lesson the hard way, and now have super-sized boxes for our super-sized cats.<br />Although &quot;This is the Maine Coon Cat&quot; is well-written and quite detailed, I'd recommend \\"That Yankee Cat\\" by Marilis Hornidge as the most interesting book written about Maine Coons.  It's a hundred-and-one pages of sheer delight for those of us who are actually lucky enough to be owned by one of these big old, shaggy down-Easterners.ized boxes for our super-sized cats.<br />Although &quot;This is the Maine Coon Cat&quot; is well-written and quite detailed, I'd recommend \\"That Yankee Cat\\" by Marilis Hornidge as the most interesting book written about Maine Coons.

However, &quot;Assyrian Sculpture&quot; should appeal to a broad audience, especially those of us who have been following recent events in Iraq and would like a brief overview of this country's ancient imperial megalomaniacs.  Even as we pulled down monuments to Saddam Hussein, so did successive dynasties of Assyrian kings loot the palaces of their predecessors and proclaim their own glory.  Visitors to their palaces were forced to view a procession of triumphalist scenes, depicting the king at war, his exploits in the hunting field, and his status as exalted by Assyrian gods and genies.<br /><br />For almost three centuries, until 612 B.C., the small kingdom of Assyria dominated the Middle East, its empire at one point extending from Iran to Egypt.  &quot;Assyrian Sculpture&quot; relates the story of those years in sculpted stone, and more rarely in glazed brick, and offers its readers a glimpse of a long-lost civilization.<br />The archaeological discovery, starting in 1843, of a wealth of artifacts from the ancient Assyrian Empire brought to the attention of Europeans a form of artistic production that was unique and unexpectedly striking to many contemporary eyes. Roughly comparable arrays of ancient Assyrian artifacts found by both French and English excavators and transported with great difficulty to Europe, were put on display almost simultaneously in the Louvre and British Museum, starting in 1847.<br />The first archaeologists to explore ancient Assyrian ruins were Paul-Emile Botta, a French diplomat, and Austen Henry Layard, an adventurous English lawyer. In the mid-nineteenth century they both explored mounds in and near present-day Mosul, a city in northern Iraq that embraces the site of ancient Nineveh. Between the two of them, they uncovered the remains of five Assyrian palaces.<br /><br />One, excavated by Layard in Nineveh, was the &quot;palace without rival&quot; of Sennacherib, perhaps the greatest of the Assyrian kings. The inner walls and courtyards were lined with two miles of sculptured stone slabs depicting the king's various campaigns, from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean.  It was under his rule that a system of canals and aqueducts brought water fifty miles from the Zagros Mountains to the parks, orchards, and gardens of Nineveh.<br />Within the palace Layard discovered thousands of clay cuneiform tablets, constituting the world's earliest-known comprehensive collection of written knowledge.  In the chapter, &quot;Biblical History in Assyrian Sculpture&quot; the author states that although there is little direct evidence for the historicity of the biblical accounts that emerged from Layard's excavations, they did confirm that &quot;the early history of Palestine, as recorded in the Bible, was more than a work of fiction.&quot;<br />Buy this book for its magnificent reproductions of Assyrian animal sculpture, for its fascinating biography of Austen Henry Layard, and for its concise overview of an ancient Mesopotamian civilization.<br />Note:  There still exists an ethnic minority who call themselves Assyrians.  They are a remnant of the Aramaic (or Syriac) speaking Christian community of northern Iraq, eastern Turkey, and western Iran.eh, was the &quot;palace without rival&quot; of Sennacherib, perhaps the greatest of the Assyrian kings.

This book is more of a howdunit than a whodunit. Carr's serial detective, the humungous Dr. Gideon Fell galumphs into view about half way through, after the obnoxious Mr. Logan is already violently deceased.  Logan meets his end when a revolver jumps off of a wall display and plugs him.  Naturally no one was anywhere near the revolver when it went off.<br />The plot is one of the more standard for gothics and Golden Age mysteries.  A rich man renovates an old mansion, supposedly haunted, then invites his acquaintances over for a week-end of ghost hunting.  One of the guests feels something grab her ankle as she walks in the door, and so we're off to a jolly start to the house party.  Guests are awakened by a loud thump in the middle of the night and set off in the dark, dressed in jammies and bathrobes to investigate the mysterious noise.  Their various nocturnal meetings and accusations complicate at least three love affairs.<br />One of the most puzzling historical events to occur in the old house was the demise of an old butler, who appeared to have been swinging on a monstrous iron chandelier before it pulled loose from the ceiling and crushed him.  When the chandelier incident is repeated with one of the current house guests, Dr. Fell must act quickly to protect the innocent and punish the real murderer.	2003-12-17

The actual toll was probably higher, but no single agency in 1913 kept track of vessels lost or sailors killed.  According to this author, the death toll did not include &quot;the commercial fishermen, hunters, or anglers who also lost their lives.&quot;<br />At least three books have been written about this storm, including &quot;Fresh Water Fury&quot; (1960), &quot;Ships Gone Missing&quot; (1992), and this book by David G. Brown, published in 2002.  One of the things that sets Brown's book apart from the others is his meticulous meteorological reconstruction of the 1913 storm that raged for four days in early November and sank ships on Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron (the worst hit) and Erie.<br />According to the author's research, the weather in early November 1913 was remarkably dry and balmy, tempting the shipping companies into making one last run before the end of the season.  The U.S. Weather Bureau issued storm warnings on November 7, 8, and 9 but these did not come close to suggesting the true ferocity of the 'White Hurricane.'  In fact the Weather Bureau never did post hurricane warnings--two red flags with black centers, displayed one above the other--on the Great Lakes, preferring to reserve that warning for tropical storms even though the four-day storm that struck the Lakes was of hurricane intensity.<br />This book is organized as a temporal narrative of the storm, starting on Wednesday, November 5 as freighters such as the 'Charles S. Price' took on loads of coal, railroad ties, and iron ore for their last trips of the season.  The 'Price's' Assistant Engineer Milton Smith had such a strong premonition about the forthcoming voyage that he quit his job and went home.  He would later be asked to identify the bodies of his shipmates that washed up on Huron's icy shores.<br />On November 6, ships on western Lake Superior were already experiencing rough weather, but nothing that qualified as a full-fledged November gale--not yet.  In Detroit, a prominent halo ringed the moon, perhaps bringing to mind the rhyme:  &quot;When halos ring the moon or sun/ Rain is coming on the run.&quot;  In the case of this particular storm, it was a warning of the ferocious blizzard that would paralyze Cleveland and other cities on the Lakes, and add to the woes of the ships that were already battling life-threatening gales.<br />The empty wooden bulk freighter 'Louisania' was the first casualty of the storm.  On Saturday, November 8, the onrushing gale stranded her near Port des Mortes on Lake Michigan, where she burned to the waterline.  Up on Lake Superior, the storm &quot;began picking apart the 'L.C. Waldo' shortly after midnight near the Keweenaw Peninsula.&quot;  Her sailors were some of the lucky few to be picked up from their stranded, ice-bound freighter, but they would have to wait until Monday, November 10 to be rescued.<br />Brown's narrative of the height of the storm is truly frightening and he can only speculate on the fates of the ships that disappeared far from land.  Of the seventeen ships known to be in lower Lake Huron on Sunday, November 9, only two survived and they sustained serious damage.<br /><br />This book also provides an extended aftermath, appendices, bibliography, and index.<br /><br />If you'd like to read more about the 'Big Blow' of 1913, I highly recommend Dwight Boyer's &quot;True Tales of the Great Lakes,&quot; William Ratigan's &quot;Great Lakes Shipwrecks and Survivals,&quot; and the above-mentioned &quot;Ships Gone Missing&quot; by Robert J.

It is third in a series of mysteries starring Gabriel Du Pr&eacute;, the M&eacute;tis descendant of French Voyageurs and Plains Indians, and it is rabidly anti-environmentalist and pro-rancher.<br />&quot;Notches&quot; is the fourth in the series, and while the former features four-legged predators, the latter concerns itself with the two-legged variety.<br />Rabid or not, such is the power of Bowen's writing and the nobility of his characters in &quot;Wolf, No Wolf&quot; that even clean, green bunny-huggers (like me) might end up voting for the ranchers and against the re-introduction of wolves into Big Sky Country at story's end.<br />All of the regulars at Touissant Bar are part of the action.  Du Pr&eacute;, master fiddler and part-time brand inspector is cast in the role of peacemaker. With help from his friends, the Shaman Benetsee, Bart the rich-guy-turned-sheriff, Du Pr&eacute;'s long-time mistress, Madelaine, and Booger Tom, the ancient, homicidal cowhand, he braves avalanches, gunfire, and false medicine men in order to prevent open warfare between the ranchers and the Earth First! crowd.<br />There are good ranchers, and there are really evil ranchers who sell dead horses for dogmeat.<br />There are good FBI agents (not very many) who are either Montanans and/or part Amerindian.  The vast majority of agents are feeble, clueless, and from out-of-state.  Some of them are so dim-witted as to try and arrest the Shaman Benetsee, who plays a wonderful joke on them with his coyotes.<br />All of the environmentalists, New Age mystics, and Yuppies in \\"Wolf, No Wolf\\" are easily identified by their expensive, crassly-colored, mail-order garments of many pockets.  They are even dumber than the FBI agents, and are easily led astray, even unto death, by the book's villains.<br /><br />And die they do, by avalanche and grizzly, by gunshot and knife, and by freezing to death in Alberta Clippers.  The ranchers rescue as many as they can, but winter in Montana is truly hell-frozen-over.  Some of Bowen's leanest, most vivid prose is devoted to descriptions of out-landers and cattle that venture out into the jaws of a Blue Northerly.<br />Better to stay in the Touissant Bar and drink fizzy, pink, screw-top wine, and listen to Du Pr&eacute; fiddle the sad, old Voyageur songs.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you're still in the mood for mayhem, follow him into &quot;Notches&quot; where he is asked to assist police on the trail of two serial killers.<br />There are good reasons why the police might not want Du Pr&eacute; at the scene of a crime.  He spits a lot as he circles the corpse, rolls his own cigarettes and mashes them out beneath his boot heel.  A forensic specialist would find traces of him all over the scene.  In &quot;Notches,&quot; he even hides evidence because he wants to track a killer without interference from the FBI.<br />On the plus side, nothing at the scene escapes him.  If he is called in to examine one body, he may find two others near by that no one else has noticed--which is exactly what occurs in &quot;Notches.&quot;  Someone has been killing girls and dumping them &quot;like old guts in the brush for the coyotes to eat,&quot; according to Du Pr&eacute;'s long-time mistress, Madelaine.<br />There are two serial killers on the loose in &quot;Notches&quot; which makes for a confusing plot.  There are also two FBI agents (see above &quot;Wolf, No Wolf&quot;) who add to the scenery, but don't do much more than engage in slanging matches with Du Pr&eacute;.  Madelaine finally presses Du Pr&eacute; into tracking the killers down when her own daughter runs away from home.<br />Du Pr&eacute; is laconic to the point of partial sentences, but the interrupted staccato of his speech is a perfect counterpoint to the harsh Montana landscape and to the sometimes abbreviated lives of its inhabitants.  Over 150 corpses form an even grimmer than usual backdrop to Du Pr&eacute;'s musings on the long history of his people and the land.<br />&quot;Notches&quot; is not so much a murder mystery as it is a complex landscape of hell from the pen of a Montanan Hieronymus Bosch.eople and the land.<br />&quot;Notches&quot; is not so much a murder mystery as it is a complex landscape of hell from the pen of a Montanan Hieronymus Bosch.	2003-12-14

Bencolin prowls the midnight caves of Paris	&quot;The Corpse in the Waxworks (1932)&quot; (alternate English title: &quot;The Waxworks Murder&quot;) features the suave, manic-depressive M. Henri Bencolin, 'juge d'instruction' of the Seine, the head of the Parisian police.  He is accompanied by his friend, the American Jeff Marle, who narrates and serves as Bencolin's straight man, muscle, and the guy who falls for all of the smouldering, silk-bosomed, possibly murderous mademoiselles.  Think of Archie Goodwin knocking off deadly Parisian apaches and rescuing Chanel-clad damsels-in-distress at the instigation of a thin, neurotic, chain-smoking, Mephistophelean Nero Wolfe.<br />In this case, the body of a pretty young woman is discovered draped across the waxen arms of the Satyr of Seine, in a murky, subterranean museum that very much resembles Madame Tussaud's (which, after all, started out as a waxworks exhibit in the pre-Revolution Palais Royale).  Soon it is difficult to tell the real corpses from the glassy-eyed, waxen tableaux such as the aforementioned Satyr, the Spanish Inquisitors and their wracked victims, or Marat lying backwards out of his tin bath, &quot;his jaw fallen, the ribs starting through his bluish skin, a claw hand plucking at the knife in his bloody chest.&quot;<br /><br />The waxworks museum also has a secret passageway that leads M. Bencolin and Jeff to the notorious Silver Key club, whose masked members indulge in midnight orgies of jazz, champagne, and secret assignations.<br /><br />John Dickson Carr descends from 'atmospheric' to 'lurid' in his Bencolin mysteries, and the midnight streets and night clubs of prewar Paris are a perfect setting for this tawdry, match-lit jewel of a mystery.  Let yourself go and prowl with this author through the green-lit grotto of the waxworks, mingle with the masked French aristocrats as they dance to &quot;the fleshy beat of a tango&quot; in the infamous Silver Key club, hide behind the lily-clad coffin of the young murder victim and spy on those who might have killed her.

If he is called in to examine one body, he may find two others near by that no one else has noticed--which is exactly what occurs in &quot;Notches.&quot;  Someone has been killing girls and dumping them &quot;like old guts in the brush for the coyotes to eat,&quot; according to Du Pr&eacute;'s long-time mistress, Madelaine.<br />There are two serial killers on the loose in &quot;Notches&quot; which makes for a confusing plot.  There are also two FBI agents who add to the scenery, but don't do much more than engage in slanging matches with Du Pr&eacute;, who after all is said and done isn't even a policeman, merely a part-time brand inspector.  Madelaine finally presses Du Pr&eacute; into tracking the killers down when her own daughter runs away from home.<br />Du Pr&eacute; is laconic to the point of partial sentences, but the interrupted staccato of his speech is a perfect counterpoint to the harsh Montana landscape and to the sometimes abbreviated lives of its inhabitants.  Over 150 corpses form an even grimmer than usual backdrop to Du Pr&eacute;'s musings on the long history of his people and the land.  This book is not so much a murder mystery as it is a complex landscape of hell from the pen of a Montanan Hieronymus Bosch.	2003-11-30

For all of you Rickman fans out there, \\"Crybbe\\" and \\"Curfew\\" are the same novel.<br /><br />Woe betide the unsuspecting city-raised New Ager who ventures out into Crybbe's mean streets while curfew is being rung--especially during one of the unnervingly frequent power blackouts.<br /><br />According to author, Phil Rickman Crybbe is a composite of Knighton, Presteigne, Clun, and Bishop's Castle---and there really is a town where the curfew bell must be rung every night.  His villagers are the equivalent of British rednecks, and all of the ghostly phenomena are local to the borderland between England and Wales, including a gigantic black dog that appears when someone is about to die.<br /><br />Stories of phantom black dogs abound in Britain.  Almost every county has its own variant, from the Black Shuck of East Anglia to the Bogey Beast of Yorkshire. In this novel, the ghost hound's name is Black Michael, and it is thought to be the spirit of a warlock, who does not quite have enough power to transform himself back into a man--although he's been trying since he hanged himself in the late 1500s.<br /><br />One of my favorite characters is killed almost immediately in this horror novel.  He is a dowser after earth mysteries called ley lines.  In this book, ley lines aren't simply lines of cosmic power linking prehistoric sites.  They are the ancient pathways of the dead, and sure enough Black Michael is usually seen rushing down a ley line.<br /><br />A young writer of an occult best-seller, Joe Powys is brought to Crybbe by a millionaire who is trying to remake the old border village into England's new mystical center.  Powys makes friends with Fay a down-on-her-luck radio reporter, and soon they are involved in the battle between Old Crybbe whose inhabitants tend to duck their heads and tug on their forelocks in the presence of the occult, and the New Age Crybbe where one can buy mystical lumpen pottery or align oneself with the Earth Mysteries through massage or acupuncture.<br /><br />As in most of Rickman's novels, the dewy-eyed mystics seem to take it on the chin.  \\"Curfew\\" also harbors a serial killer who discovered Black Michael's skeletal hand hidden in his chimney.  He goes from murder to ever-grislier murder while occult forces wreak a separate havoc on Crybbe.  The novel's resolution gets a bit garbled and tedious when all of the evil forces line up against what's left of the good, and for the first time in 400 years the curfew bell falls silent.<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT***<br /><br />Suffice to say that Joe and three-legged Arnold go on to greater glory in \\"The Chalice.\\"  Fay goes back to work for the BBC.

All of the characters act suspiciously, including the true and false heir to the extensive Farnleigh estate (and the title that goes with it), their two lawyers, the butler, Lady Farnleigh, and assorted family friends. The reader has many reasons to suspect each character in turn after the murder (or was it suicide?) of one of the two competing heirs.<br />The only person who might be able to tell whether the true John Farnleigh died or still lives is his tutor, Murray who happens to have taken a thumb-o-graph of young John before he was sent away to America to live with a distant relative.<br />John wasn't the heir, but the black sheep of the family when he was packed off to Colorado via the spanking, new ocean liner, 'Titanic.' He was thought to have died when his ship sank on her maiden voyage, but after his older brother dies without issue, not one but two John Farnleighs show up within a year of each other to claim the family estate and title. The first one to appear marries John's childhood sweetheart and settles down to manage Farnleigh.<br />Then up pops John Farnleigh #2, one of the competing heirs dies, and someone steals Murray's thumb-o-graph. The reader is beset with conflicting stories and clues, when Dr. Fell finally lumbers onto the scene with his shovel-hat, swirling cape, and crutch-headed cane. He figures out who killed whom right away, but the reader is left grasping at hints (some of them pretty darn subtle - I think Carr cheats a little on this mystery) until the final denouement, which involves that fateful night when the 'Titanic' went down.<br />As always with this author, the eerie, suffocating atmosphere surrounding a mysterious death is tinged with an aura of the supernatural. &quot;The Crooked Hinge&quot; features devil worship and a horrible old eighteenth-century automaton called, 'The Golden Hag.' Her sinister appearances alone make this a novel worth savoring, and Carr also provides a meticulously plotted mystery (although I could do without a few of his great detective's tics and his refusal to blab out the name of the murderer as soon as he figures out whodunit. And what the dickens is a shovel-hat?)g.'

Nevertheless, there are some fascinating personal accounts of the U.S. Equestrian Team's (USET's) greatest moments by the equestrians who lived them, including Bill Steinkraus, General Jack R. Burton, Neal Shapiro, and Kathy Kusner.  As Bill Steinkraus says in his introduction, this book &quot;is neither an objective history, a collection of personal reminiscences nor a book of instruction, yet it includes elements of all three.&quot;<br />&quot;The USET Book of Riding&quot; is divided into three sections: &quot;Show Jumping;&quot; &quot;Combined Training&quot; (three day eventing); and &quot;Dressage &amp; General Considerations.&quot;  There is also an Appendix of USET results in events such as the Olympics, Pan American Games, and Nations Cups up through 1975.<br />After you finish the &quot;Foreword&quot; by Whitney Stone and the &quot;Editor's Introduction&quot; by Bill Steinkraus, you might want to skip to the last chapter of the book and read the charming &quot;An Overseas View of the USET.&quot;  Its author, English show jumper Douglas Bunn created the All-England Jumping Course at Hickstead, and he was fond of inviting his American counterparts over for a few rounds of competition or training.  His anecdotes of USET in the 1950s are both lively and affectionate:<br />&quot;The Americans showed us that you could still ride like an Englishman (or indeed, like a gentleman) and win big classes.&quot;<br />The history of showing jumping, eventing, and dressage in this country (or at least in this book) begins with the Horse Cavalry.  One of the authors, who was a member of the U.S. Army Olympic equestrian team in 1948, rode horses that were 'liberated' from the enemy during WWII.  The military origins of combined training as an exercise for the cavalry horse are covered by ex-Army riders Arthur J. McCashin and John W. Russell, who both made the transition to USET in the early 50s.<br />Descriptions of riding styles, equipment, and courses, plus stories about the individual horses and riders are what make this book so interesting.  One of my favorite chapters, &quot;The Horse with the Flying Tail&quot; is narrated by Hugh Wiley, rider of the famous Palomino show jumper, Nautical.<br />Wiley didn't meet up with Nautical (a.k.a. Injun' Joe, a.k.a. Peter de Oro) until he watched him at a show in Hanover, Pennsylvania.  Nautical &quot;didn't win, but some of his jumps were unbelievable.  He could leave out strides and be 2' over the biggest oxer.&quot;<br />The horse was a crowd-pleaser, but scary to ride.  In fact, Wiley says &quot;...he seemed to me to be a complete nut.&quot;  If you've seen Walt Disney's &quot;Horse with the Flying Tail,&quot; you should definitely read this true account of Nautical's bumpy rise to stardom.  This rider's last paragraph about his great Palimino's demise will leave all horse-lovers misty-eyed.<br />Anyone who has ever completed a circuit of jumps on horseback, has studied the demanding art of dressage, or has cursed the networks for not showing enough of the Olympian equestrian events on T.V., will be deeply engrossed by this book.r J.

It is third in a series of mysteries starring Gabriel Du Pr&eacute;, the M&eacute;tis descendant of French Voyageurs and Plains Indians, and it is rabidly anti-environmentalist and pro-rancher.<br />Rabid or not, such is the power of Bowen's writing and the nobility of his characters that even clean, green bunny-huggers (like me) might end up voting for the ranchers and against the re-introduction of wolves into Big Sky Country at story's end.<br />All of the regulars at Touissant Bar are part of the action in &quot;Wolf, No Wolf.&quot; Du Pr&eacute;, master fiddler and part-time brand inspector is cast in the role of peacemaker. With help from his friends, the Shaman Benetsee, Bart the rich-guy-turned-sheriff, Du Pr&eacute;'s long-time mistress, Madelaine, and Booger Tom, the ancient, homicidal cowhand, he braves avalanches, gunfire, and false medicine men in order to prevent open warfare between the ranchers and the Earth First! crowd.<br />There are good ranchers, and there are really evil ranchers who sell dead horses for dogmeat.<br />There are good FBI agents (not very many) who are either Montanans and/or part Amerindian. The vast majority of agents are feeble, clueless, and from out-of-state. Some of them are so dim-witted as to try and arrest the Shaman Benetsee, who plays a wonderful joke on them with his coyotes. (A previous reviewer compared Benetsee to Yoda. Boys and girls, that reviewer was dead-on. Lucasfilm© should take Peter Bowen to court for kidnapping.)<br />All of the environmentalists, New Age mystics, and Yuppies in &quot;Wolf, No Wolf&quot; are easily identified by their expensive, crassly-colored, mail-order garments of many pockets. They are even dumber than the FBI agents, and are easily led astray, even unto death, by the book's true evil empire (sorry, Lucasfilm©).<br />And die they do, by avalanche and grizzly, by gunshot and knife, and by freezing to death in Alberta Clippers. The ranchers rescue as many as they can, but winter in Montana is truly hell-frozen-over. Some of Bowen's leanest, most vivid prose is devoted to descriptions of out-landers and cattle that venture out into the jaws of a Blue Northerly.<br />Better to stay in the Touissant Bar and drink fizzy, pink, screw-top wine, and listen to Du Pr&eacute; fiddle the sad, old Voyageur songs.lippers.

All weapons must be surrendered before entering the fair and wizards are discouraged from glamorizing shoddy goods with their spells.  Of course, as at any large festival, the fair at Ithkar has its share of rogues, piratical merchants, bravos, potion-makers and witches, troupes of entertainers (not a few of them turning tricks), and gullible pilgrims.<br />A sampling of the fourteen stories in this volume:<br />&quot;The Clockwork Woman&quot; - Ann R. Brown<br />A mechanical doll is so deceptively life-like that when she is exhibited at the fair, a wealthy man in the audience tries to buy her.  Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately) for him, there's a real woman concealed within the doll.  She is a dwarf and has fallen in love with her tall, beautiful mechanical persona.  When she persuades her friend and fellow dwarf to take his place within a newly constructed mechanical man, she learns an important lesson in love.<br />&quot;First Do No Harm&quot; - Mildred Downey Broxon<br />Young Lithras is a character who could have been lifted from one of Norton's own fantasies--a young, untrained witch who is enslaved, then kills her master and escapes to the fair in Ithkar.  She competes for a job as a body healer to a wealthy nobleman, and confesses to one of the other competitors:  &quot;I am no anointed healer, but a maimed thing, unfinished.&quot;--Doesn't that sound like a character from the pen of the Gandalf Grand Master of Fantasy herself?  This story also has one of Norton's ambiguously romantic endings.<br />&quot;Honeycomb&quot; - Esther M. Friesner<br />Author Esther Friesner has also written and published many fantasy series, including the Twelve Kingdoms (&quot;Mustapha and his Wise Dog&quot;), New York (&quot;New York by Knight&quot;), and Tim Desmond (&quot;Gnome Man's Land&quot;) novels.  &quot;Honeycomb&quot; is one of the most magical stories to come out of Ithkar, and involves a mysterious candlemaker and her effect on a young woodcarver.  A truly sweet, funny story in which an unfaithful lover is changed into a bear and a young not-so-maidenly maiden is forced by an enchanted candle to confess her urgent need for a husband.<br />If you are searching for good sword &amp; sorcery short stories, you might find exactly what you crave at Ithkar's magical fair.nd Master of Fantasy herself?

Craft was born in Japan and began to draw and paint as a young child. Her meticulous attention to detail and the sheer beauty of her subjects are what attracted me to her &quot;Women of Enchantment&quot; Calendar. Recently, she has been illustrating children's books, e.g. &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (2002 - SeaStar Books), fantasy book jackets, e.g. Patricia McKillip's &quot;In the Forests of Serre&quot; (2003), and posters.<br /><br />Four of the illustrations featured in this calendar are opera posters:  &quot;Aida;&quot; &quot;Das Rheingold;&quot; &quot;G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung;&quot; and &quot;Madama Butterfly.&quot;  Aida is a regally beautiful Ethiopian (after all, she was a princess as well as a slave).  Madama Butterfly is represented as a mysterious, rather Victorian geisha.  The Rhine Maidens languidly taunt a sinister Alberich, and Br&uuml;nnhilde rides Grane into Siegfried's funeral pyre.<br />Kinuko Craft's 'Ring' illustrations are as lush and detailed as that splendid set by Arthur Rackham, although more romantic and less moody.<br />Imogen from Shakespeare's &quot;Cymbeline,&quot; originally painted for Simon &amp; Schuster, naps in splendid draperies on this calendar.  She is accompanied by two queens: Eleanor of Aquitaine on a magnificent white horse; and Isabella who seems to be meditating on a broadsword and the scales of justice.<br />An Etruscan-looking Proserpine and a blonde, sleeping Psyche are brought to life from Greek mythology.  Two months reproduce Craft's book-cover illustrations for Patricia McKillip: &quot;In the Forests of Serre&quot; (my personal favorite), and &quot;The Book of Atrix Wolfe.&quot;<br />I'm guessing that the final painting is of a Balinese Angel Goddess--no matter, all twelve of Craft's sumptuous oil on watercolor paintings are sure to enthrall.	2003-10-31

Lesser authors have butted into the series, presumably with Norton's permission since this remarkable Gandalf Grand Master of Fantasy and the Nebula Grand Master is still writing (her first novel was published in 1934, her latest fantasy in 2002).<br />One Solar Queen rip-off to avoid at all costs is &quot;Redline: the Stars.&quot;<br />Norton's Solar Queen stories are told from the viewpoint of Dane Thorson, an apprentice-Cargo Master who is introduced to us in &quot;Sargasso of Space&quot; as a &quot;lanky, very young man in an ill-fitting Trader's tunic.&quot;  Most of this author's heroes and heroines are young, uncertain of themselves, shy, with a tendency to trip over their own enthusiasms and load themselves up with guilt at the slightest opportunity.  They are very likeable and their adventures are narrated in remarkably lean prose with just the right touch of description.<br />After ten years of schooling, orphan Dane Thorson is assigned via a computer analysis of his psychological profile--not to a safe berth on a sleek Company-run starship that his classmates were vying for--but to a battered tramp of a Free Trader. To say that the 'Solar Queen' &quot;lacked a great many refinements and luxurious fittings which the Company ships boasted&quot; was an understatement.  But she was a tightly-run ship and what she lacked in refinement, she made up for in adventure.  Dane soon settles in under Cargo Master Van Rycke and learns &quot;to his dismay what large gaps unfortunately existed in his training.&quot;<br /><br />Sometimes I just want to give Dane a big hug.<br />The crew of the 'Solar Queen' risk their meager capital in a gamble at a Survey auction, and win trading rights to a barely explored planet with the unlucky name of Limbo.  When they view a microfilm (okay, the technology is a bit dated in these books) of their new prize, it appears as though they have purchased ten years of trading rights to a planet that was burned to cinder during the heyday of the mysterious Forerunners, who predated humans in space.<br />Just when the Queen's fortune seems to be at its lowest ebb, a tough-looking archeologist shows up who is supposedly an expert on Forerunner artifacts, and charters her for a voyage to Limbo.<br />It might have been better for the free traders if her captain had kept his ship planeted and declared bankruptcy after the disastrous Survey auction.<br />This 'Solar Queen' novel is a prime representative of Norton's lean action-packed brand of story-telling.

Dane soon settles in under Cargo Master Van Rycke and learns &quot;to his dismay what large gaps unfortunately existed in his training.&quot;  <BR> <BR>Sometimes I just want to give Dane a big hug.<br />The crew of the 'Solar Queen' risk their meager capital in a gamble at a Survey auction, and win trading rights to a barely explored planet with the unlucky name of Limbo.  When they view a microfilm (okay, the technology is a bit dated in these books) of their new prize, it appears as though they have purchased ten years of trading rights to a planet that was burned to cinder during the heyday of the mysterious Forerunners, who predated humans in space.<br />Just when the Queen's fortune seems to be at its lowest ebb, a tough-looking archeologist shows up who is supposedly an expert on Forerunner artifacts, and charters her for a voyage to Limbo.<br />It might have been better for the free traders if her captain had kept his ship planeted and declared bankruptcy after the disastrous Survey auction.<br />This 'Solar Queen' novel is a prime representative of Norton's lean action-packed brand of story-telling.

In &quot;The Revenge of God&quot; he discusses the resurgence of the three monotheisms that each claims Jerusalem as its own holy city.  This book was first published in 1994, but Professor Kepel's chapters on the Islamic revival can be profitably read with post-9/11 hindsight.<br />Just a glance at this week's 'NY Times' headlines such as &quot;Syria, Long Ruthlessly Secular, Sees Fervent Islamic Resurgence&quot; and &quot;Bush Says He Disagrees With General [Boykin's] Remarks on Religion&quot; are an indication that Professor Kepel's comparative essay is still very topical.<br />From my viewpoint, the most frightening chapters were not on the revival of Islamic extremism, but the battle for the re-Judaization of Israel by groups such as the Gush Emunim.  Intellectually, the concept of 'sacred ground' is easily understood, but the viewpoint that non-Jews have no right to the land that had been promised to the Chosen People is harder to grasp by someone like myself who was raised in a secular state--especially when that viewpoint was carried to its logical extreme via a plot to blow up the mosques on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.<br />If you think it is going to be easy for the Israeli Government to disband the West Bank settlements of its fundamentalist citizens, you need to read this book.<br />The title of this book might even give an atheist cause to fear when examined in the light of extremist groups such as Gush Emunium or the followers of Sayyid Qutb, the father of modern Islamist fundamentalism.  According to Professor Kepel, the radical pessimism of Sayyid Qutb's message did not take root until social conditions in Egypt fell into disarray in the 1970s.  Modernism and secularism were profoundly rejected by Qutb's followers, just as they had been by members of Jewish, Protestant, and Catholic fundamentalist groups.<br />The author contends that the 'simultaniety' of this rejection of modernism by all of these religious groups was the &quot;loss of assurance born of scientific and technological progress since the 1950s.&quot;  Another factor was the death of &quot;the great atheist messianic ideology of the twentieth century, communism.&quot;  In his concluding chapter, &quot;Reconquering the World,&quot; Professor Kepel writes that the danger (although he does not use the word 'danger') posed by the fundamentalist groups is that in their rejection of the philosophy of the Enlightenment, they also reject the legitimacy of secular governments.  &quot;The successes of the Islamists are the clearest indication of the political, economic, and social bankruptcy of the post-independence ruling elites.&quot;<br />How will the social breakdown of the Muslim Mediterranean countries affect the rest of the world?  We are just beginning to realize what a quagmire we've gotten ourselves into in Iraq.  Even if you don't agree with Professor Kepel's thesis, read this book for a French professor's view of American evangelists Jerry Falwell, Oral Roberts, and Jim Bakker.  He doesn't take any cheap shots, but he'll still make you smile (or say 'ouch')./>The author contends that the 'simultaniety' of this rejection of modernism by all of these religious groups was the &quot;loss of assurance born of scientific and technological progress since the 1950s.&quot;  Another factor was the death of &quot;the great atheist messianic ideology of the twentieth century, communism.&quot;  In his concluding chapter, &quot;Reconquering the World,&quot; Professor Kepel writes that the danger (although he does not use the word 'danger') posed by the fundamentalist groups is that in their rejection of the philosophy of the Enlightenment, they also reject the legitimacy of secular governments.  &quot;The successes of the Islamists are the clearest indication of the political, economic, and social bankruptcy of the post-independence ruling elites.&quot;<br />How will the social breakdown of the Muslim Mediterranean countries affect the rest of the world?

It also happens to be part of the loot I won when one of my questions was accepted for the Metropolitan Opera Quiz radio broadcast.<br />The late Paul Hume, a highly respected music critic who once drew the ire of President Harry Truman after he panned his daughter's song recital, published this book in 1977.  It can be read comfortably in an afternoon as it only runs to 173 pages, and is padded out with over 100 photographs and illustrations, and rounded out with one- or two-page summaries of all of Verdi's operas.<br />As may well be imagined, many of the photographs are taken from Met productions of Verdi's operas.<br />In his introduction, Hume exhorts his reader to, &quot;Above all, remember the heart of Verdi, which beats in [his] operas and the Requiem.&quot;  It is obvious that he loves his subject and is very knowledgeable about his life.  Verdi shines through these pages as a young prodigy who loved deeply and was supported by the life-long loyalty of his friends.  When his musical career was almost terminated by the early deaths of his wife and children, the impresario Merelli did not abandon &quot;his new composer,&quot; who after all had only written two operas, one of them a failure.  He hounded Verdi until the composer agreed to examine a new libretto by Solera that was based on the Old Testament story of the capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchanezzar (Nabucco).<br />The rest is history.  As Verdi himself once wrote, &quot;I can say with a certainty that this opera marked the beginning of my career as a composer.&quot;<br />The author intimates that there are some who would say that Verdi's &quot;Otello&quot; is greater than Shakespeare's, and Victor Hugo, whose play &quot;Le Roi s'Amuse&quot; formed the libretto of &quot;Rigoletto,&quot; was jealous of this opera's great Act III quartet:  &quot;If I could only make four characters in my plays speak at the same time...I would obtain the very same effect.&quot;<br />Only Verdi's music allows us to look simultaneously into the hearts of his four characters, while  Hume's book allows us to look into the heart of a great composer, who was also a great man.artet:  &quot;If I could only make four characters in my plays speak at the same time...I would obtain the very same effect.&quot;    <br />Only Verdi's music allows us to look simultaneously into the hearts of his four characters, while   Hume's book allows us to look into the heart of a great composer, who was also a great man.	2003-10-18

This is a big, complex, scary read with Rickman's usual cast of likeable characters, including an Anglican vicar who turns a blind eye on some not-so-Christian rites that are performed in his church, and a doughty pub owner whose husband seems to have returned from the dead.<br />Folksinger Moira Cairns, who shows up in multiple Rickman novels, plays a prominent role in &quot;The Man in the Moss,&quot; along with a band of white magicians called the Bridelow Mother's League.<br />The title character himself has been dead for roughly two thousand years--the man in the moss, who I believe Rickman modeled after the Lindlow bogman.  At any rate, both fictional and non-fictional bogmen were victims of a Celtic triple sacrifice.<br />According to the Roman historian, Lucan (AD 39 - AD 65), the Celts sometimes sacrificed one person to please all three aspects of their triple god: first, death by three blows to the skull; second, death by strangulation and/or throat cutting; and third, death by drowning (in this case, drowning in a peat bog.)<br /><br />Again, following the research that was done on the Lindlow man, Rickman's characters believe that the Man in the Moss sacrificed himself willingly to thwart a Roman invasion.  His willingness to die and his 'displeasure' at being dug up out of the bog are a dark, steady undertow that drags more than one character in this book to his or her doom.  The people of the isolated Pennine village of Bridelow want their bogman returned to the grave in order to keep some unspecified supernatural evil at bay---and they figure that they need to get him reburied before Samhain (November 1), the Celtic Feast of the Dead.<br />Two major obstacles prevent the villagers from reinterring the Man in the Moss:<br />* the scientific johnnies are horrified by the thought of giving up their find to a pack of superstitious villagers, and they have him locked away in a climate-controlled room at the University;<br />* an evil sorcerer wants to steal the bogman and use him in a satanic rite that will destroy the village of Bridelow and its Mothers' Union of white magicians.<br />Death is a repeated visitor to the village on the Moss in the weeks leading up to Samhain.  Rickman builds to a slow, sinister climax and this reader at least was never really sure who was dead and who was alive, and which of the two conditions was the most desirable--at least in Bridelow.ck of superstitious villagers, and they have him locked away in a climate-controlled room at the University;<br />* an evil sorcerer wants to steal the bogman and use him in a satanic rite that will destroy the village of Bridelow and its Mothers' Union of white magicians. <br />Death is a repeated visitor to the village on the Moss in the weeks leading up to Samhain.

When she burns out trying to heal the unceasing stream of addicts, assault victims, and alcoholics who flood into her emergency room, she joins M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res and descends even further into what might be the modern tenth and eleventh circles of hell:  Bosnia in the depths of war and genocide; and Africa during a meningitis epidemic.<br />Grim, indeed.  This is not a book to read if you're already feeling depressed.  I thought I wouldn't have a problem with this story because I'd been watching that interesting and horrifying bit of reality T.V. called, &quot;Trauma: Life in the E.R.&quot;  Now I realize that even though 'Trauma' viewers see everything from surgeons rooting around in a gunshot victim's intestines to ER physicians trying to save an eyeball that has popped out of an accident victim's head, reality T.V. doesn't come close to Dr. Grim's reality.<br />Some of her saddest cases, in Chicago at least, involve babies born to cocaine-addicted, alcoholic mothers who don't come into contact with a physician until they're giving birth.  Babies in America aren't usually born in an emergency room--except when Dr. Grim happens to be moonlighting in a hospital that doesn't have an obstetrician on site, or when the mother is wheeled into ER with two bullets through her brain.  In one of the most gruesome episodes in this book, she assists in the birth of an anencephalic baby:  &quot;There was a rivulet of fluid, and then this 'thing' slithered out onto the cart...&quot;<br />Never mind.  At least the babies in Chicago don't die of tetanus like they still do in Africa.  In her preface to the chapter, &quot;How to Treat Tetanus,&quot; Dr. Grim quotes from the Qu' aran:<br />Also a sign for them is that we bear their progeny on the laden ship. / If we will, we drown them, / and there is no helper for them/ nor are they saved, unless as a mercy from us...<br />There is very little mercy in this chapter about a Nigerian police officer who dies of a treatable, preventable disease that Dr. Grim never experienced in all of her years in Chicago.  She does what she can for the man, scrounging medicine from her meningitis cases, taping &quot;TOUCH THIS IV AND YOU DIE&quot; to the man's IV, even transporting him from the M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res field clinic to a 'tetanus hospital' ten miles away.  The so-called 'hospital' had no medicine, no beds, not even a dark, quiet place for him to die.  Some of the author's most poignant musings occur while she is travelling with the dying man.  She thinks about the equipment, techniques, and medicine that would have been able to treat this man in America--even on the South Side of Chicago.<br />This is a profoundly moving book.cy from us...<br />There is very little mercy in this chapter about a Nigerian police officer who dies of a treatable, preventable disease that Dr. Grim never experienced in all of her years in Chicago.

Too many people are devoured by the demon for it to be tongue-in-cheek...unless it's the demon's cheek and our tongue we're talking about here.  However, &quot;Practical Demonkeeping&quot; is witty, shading into heavily ironic.  It is blackly humorous as in the scene where the demon coughed, &quot;...and a red spiked heel shot out of his mouth and bounced off the windshield, spattering the glass with hellish spit.&quot;<br />You might guess that the red high heel once belonged to a woman, but it's not that kind of novel.  As a matter of fact it belonged to a motel night clerk named Billy Winston who was a transvestite from the waist down (the parts that the motel customers can't see below the counter).  Most of Moore's characters have some redeeming characteristics, even the scum-bag drug dealers and pool sharks, and I was really sorry when the demon ate Billy.<br />Even the demon whose name is Catch has his likeable moments--usually when he's reading Cookie Monster comic books and in between snacks.  He also has a sense of humor, the kind of humor you'd expect from a cat toying with its next meal.<br />Some of the book's real humor comes from a second supernatural creature, the King of the Djinn who has been chasing after Catch ever since the glory days of King Solomon--except for a few thousand years of down time in a lead jar at the bottom of the sea.  He expresses himself in phrases such as, &quot;By Aladdin's lamplit scrotum,&quot; and &quot;Tell us where the Seal of Solomon is hidden or we will have your genitals in a nine-speed reverse action blender.&quot;  The true hero of &quot;Practical Demonkeeping,&quot; owner of Pine Cove, California's bait, tackle, and fine wines shop thinks the King of the Djinn looks like &quot;a prune in a Carmen Miranda costume.&quot;  Nevertheless, this unlikely pair teams up to do a bit of demon-hunting.<br />Wickedly funny.  That's the term I'm searching for.  This book with its winos, pagans, wrinkled-prune Djinn, and hungry demon is wickedly funny.  Read it and you might even die, especially if you ignore its warning not to pick up hitchhikers near Pine Cove, California.nos, pagans, wrinkled-prune Djinn, and hungry demon is wickedly funny.

Joe Powys, Crybbe's occult author and his three-legged dog, Arnold play important roles in &quot;The Chalice.&quot;<br />Rickman's characters are so appealing that I got really, really angry when he pretended to kill off one of my favorites.  His good guys are always laid-back, slightly cynical in spite of the supernatural fireworks going off around them, and they are unremittingly kind to animals and lost souls.  They keep plugging away on the side of the angels, in spite of the most horrific punishment, and Rickman doesn't let them escape from evil by trotting into a church or waving a cross.<br />His bad guys are sadistic jerks, usually with a whole busload of power from beyond the grave.  And speaking of buses, if a long black spray-painted vehicle with a rusty grill shows up in your vicinity, run like hell.  Forget the Black Chalice.  It was the Black Bus that frightened me the most in this story.<br />The author weaves his legend of the Chalice from two separate strands:  the legend of the Holy Grail that was brought by Joseph of Arimathea to the mystic Isle of Avalon (Glastonbury); and the Celtic tradition of a cup that was sacred to the gods of the underworld, or the Land Beneath the Waves.<br />It's Christians - 10, Celts - 0 in this novel, although Rickman is kinder to pagans in his other stories.  And come to think of it, the professed Christians (the ones who actually go to church) don't fare too well here, either.  They are represented by a scatty, New Age bishop who is trying to reconcile his Church with the pagans, and a farmer who turns to Jesus when the Black Bus terrorizes his lower forty.  The only really likeable Christian was hanged, drawn and quartered during the reign of Henry VIII, although he too has a role to play, along with the chalice that captured his last drops of blood.<br />Glastonbury becomes a spiritual battlefield of Christians versus pagans, land-owners versus 'travellers,' old established hippies versus New Age mystics, a handful of animal rights activists to mix things up with everyone, and of course Good versus Evil.  Rickman juggles his multiple themes in such a way that you'll want to keep on reading and rooting for the good guys.

The ancient Romans regarded it as the entrance to hell (as did the real Vergil), and Davidson's city could very well perform that function. It is a noxious city of forges and dye vats, built above a huge, meandering reservoir of natural gas that slowly poisons all who try to live in Averno.  However it is known as 'the very rich city' and commerce at least, thrives.  Much of this novel graphically details the suffering of the workers in the forges, tanneries, dye-vats, and abattoirs of Averno.  Poison gases churn in their lungs.  Their limbs are crippled in the ceaseless production of cheaply dyed cloth and coarsely forged iron.  Everyone dies young, even the wealthy.<br /><br />Vergil is lured to Averno by a half-dream.  He meets up with a blind jeweler and a mad king, among others, and finally contracts with a group of rich merchants to investigate the recent faltering of the city's source of natural gas--the underpinning of its immense wealth.<br />This novel defies all of the stereotypes of the fantasy genre.  There is very little magic as we fantasy-readers know it. Averno is a dark, hellish city constructed of greed and poison. Vergil functions more as a civil engineer than a mage, and is constantly plagued by visions of what-might-have-been or what-might-be.  The Sibyl's prophecies are impenetrable until after the fact, and the mannered, erudite narrative is at times as impenetrable as the Sibyl's prophecies.<br />&quot;Vergil in Averno&quot; is hard slogging, but a determined reader is rewarded with the minutely-detailed depiction of a Roman Empire that could have been but never was. Davidson sometimes swamps his narrative with idiosyncratic, archaic-sounding language---he reportedly performed massive amounts of research over a period of more than 20 years for his alternate histories--and the world he evokes seems totally authentic, for all that it never existed.<br />If you have the patience to work your way through the phantasmagoric thicket of Vergil's digressions, visions, memories, 'might-be's, and 'could have been's, his story might solidify into a structure of peculiar, intricate beauty found nowhere else, except perhaps in the novels of Gabriel Garc&iacute;a Marquez and other magical realists.is hard slogging, but a determined reader is rewarded with the minutely-detailed depiction of a Roman Empire that could have been but never was.

When he was born at ten minutes after midnight, March 30, 1970, his owner took one look at him and said, &quot;There is a whopper.&quot; His own firstborn was an Appaloosa colt named 'First Secretary'. Another son - a draft horse cross - is still alive and well and recently retired from the Southwest dressage circuit. Yet a third son won the Belmont by a margin of 21 lengths, in what was the second fastest running and third largest margin in history.<br /><br />Of course, his Daddy still holds the record for both margin and time.<br />And who is Risen Star's Daddy?<br /><br />Secretariat, of course. No one who admires this special breed of horse could possibly have flunked this quiz.<br /><br />When we watched Big Red hit the wire 31 lengths ahead of Twice a Prince in 1973, crushing the Belmont stakes record by two seconds and change, many of us knew that we would not see his like again. According to his jockey, Ron Turcotte, Secretariat was retired before he had reached his full potential at the longer distances. We would have loved to watch that big red horse run all day and smash every record there was, but it was not to be.<br />At any rate, reading William Nack's book is the next best thing to watching him run (unless you are lucky enough and rich enough to own one of his 'blue hen' daughters). At least his fans can relive the races Big Red did run, and Nack has the knack (sorry) of bringing them vividly back to memory. This book and &quot;Wild Ride: The Rise and Tragic Fall of Calumet Farm, Inc., America's Premier Racing Dynasty&quot; by Ann Hagedorn Auerbach are my two favorite reads on all aspects of the Thoroughbred racing industry in the United States. &quot;Secretariat&quot; reflects the brilliance of the Thoroughbred and its human interface. &quot;Wild Ride&quot; reflects the dark side of that same relationship.<br /><br />My only complaint regarding Nack's treatment of Secretariat is that although it starts in the right place (the birth of Somethingroyal's whopping, chestnut foal), it didn't extend much beyond Big Red's last race. I would have liked to follow him through at least part of his career at stud.<br /><br />However, that might be asking too much of a book that was published only two years after this great Thoroughbred retired from the track.<br /><br />At the beginning of the new millennium, Man O'War was voted 'Thoroughbred of the Century' by a panel that was assembled by 'Blood Horse' Magazine. But those of us who saw Secretariat win the Belmont will remember him as first, and (as they said about one of his most famous ancestors) the rest nowhere.same relationship.<BR> <BR>My only complaint regarding Nack's treatment of Secretariat is that although it starts in the right place (the birth of Somethingroyal's whopping, chestnut foal), it didn't extend much beyond Big Red's last race.

If you are interested in the natural history of our land, his 'American Seasons' series is the perfect place to start reading.  All of his books, including &quot;A Naturalist Buys an Old Farm&quot; reflect the philosophy of Thoreau and Muir and the value they placed on the meaning and beauty of the natural world.<br />This author belongs to the same generation of nature writers as Rachel Carson, Loren Eiseley, Sigurd Olson, and Lewis Thomas, but his writing style is less didactic, gentler, more wondering.  He shares his life on an old Connecticut farm now reverting to its original wildness, with keen observation and unabashed wonder.  Edwin Way Teale was the opposite of cynical.  He was a man who loved to wake up in the morning, whether it was to freshly fallen snow, the &quot;trip-hammer tattoo&quot; of a flicker &quot;in the full flush of his springtime exuberance,&quot; or even the fiery blisters from a run-in with poison sumac.  As to the latter experience, he writes that it was shared with John Burroughs who, sixty-eight years before on the banks of the Hudson, &quot;had viewed the world through one eye...while the other was swelled shut as a result of encountering poison sumac.&quot;<br />In chapter one, &quot;Three Circles on a Map,&quot; Edwin and his wife Nellie spend three years searching for the perfect home, surrounded by various aspects of American wilderness, e.g. woods, a stream, a swamp, open meadows (not your usual home-buyer's requirements).  After so many years of crisscrossing the United States and recording their travels in the four 'American Seasons' books, they were ready to sink roots and find contentment in their immediate surroundings.

Loathsome, brown candles are a regular supernatural visitation foretelling death and/or really hellish sex.  However, this book isn't really about sex (even though I keep talking about it.)<br />It's about music.<br />I learned more than I thought I ever wanted to know about John Lennon, Jim Morrison, Bob Dylan, and even Simon and Garfunkel--well, Goth horror is something else this book is not--mostly it concerns musicians from the 60's who didn't make it very far into the 80's.  One of the main characters, Dave the guitarist, is plagued by the notion that he could have prevented John Lennon's death on December 8, 1980.  Dave has some pretty snappy dialogues with Lennon who now seems to be living in his head.<br />Dave isn't the only one with a psychic problem.  All of the musicians who attempted to record an album in an ancient abbey-turned-recording-studio on the date of Lennon's death are traumatized by a tragedy that gradually works its way to the surface through the course of this novel.<br />Rickman piles horror upon horror until thirteen years after Lennon's death, the musicians are compelled to return to the abbey to complete the song that had called up an ancient evil.<br />You'll be reading this one through the night--even though you shouldn't.th, the musicians are compelled to return to the abbey to complete the song that had called up an ancient evil.<br />You'll be reading this one through the night--even though you shouldn't.	2003-09-23

Inventive characterization is this author's hallmark, and McKinley reimagines and reinvigorates Sleeping Beauty as a princess named Rosie who is cursed to die on her 21st birthday after pricking her finger on a spindle. On her Naming Day, after a very bad fairy named Pernicia delivers the curse, the infant princess is kidnapped by the down-to-earth Katriona (okay, she's a fairy, too, but not in the sense of 'airy fairy') who raises the disguised princess in the distant farming hamlet of Foggy Bottom.  Eventually Rosie apprentices herself to a blacksmith, discovers that she can talk to animals, and befriends a girl named Peony.<br />Peony is actually much more of a traditional Sleeping Beauty--meek, beautiful, skilled in the feminine arts, and somewhat passive.  Rosie is an active, callused horse doctor who ultimately takes on the traditional prince's role, with the help of her friends Katriona, the blacksmith, and some very remarkable animals.<br />Have no fear, &quot;Spindle's End&quot; is not a feminist rant.  Men get some very nice walk-on roles and the only really evil personage is Pernicia who hovers threateningly throughout the novel:<br />&quot;Perhaps I shall even come to her, in secret, tonight...and press her tiny soft hand against the spindle end...&quot;<br />McKinley has created a densely magicked universe, shading over into cutesy only occasionally.  Unfortunately most of the shading was in the first couple of chapters and I almost got clogged by the treacle and stopped reading.  I was glad I didn't because this is a marvelous, non-wimpy reworking of the usual 'beautiful woman can do nothing for herself but wait passively for handsome prince' fairy tale.	2003-09-21

And there's no `payable when the foal stands and nurses' clause in his contract, either.<br />\\"Stud\\" is a two-year labor of love by \\"New Yorker\\" staff writer, Kevin Conley who became intrigued by the amount of money that a Thoroughbred stallion could earn after retiring from the racetrack.  This is an exuberant, stylishly-written book that will tell you everything you wanted to know about what goes on in the breeding shed, but were afraid to ask.<br />I also learned some things I didn't know I wanted to know, like the diameter of a certain stallion's testicles---this is a book for horse-lovers who have already been through sex education class.<br />The author spends some time at the Keeneland sales in Lexington, Kentucky, where the `Doobie Brothers' (four sheiks from the royal family of Dubai) duke it out with the `boys' (Ireland's Coolmore Stud) for the most expensive yearlings in the sale (often  Storm Cat progeny).  Conley doesn't neglect the smaller breeders who make a profit by buying and breeding inexpensive mares with good blood-lines, and then selling their yearlings and two-year-olds for a profit. (There was a story in a recent \\"Thoroughbred Times\\" about a filly \\"who clearly did not have enough pedigree to shoot for the stars,\\" yet was sold for $1.9 million at Barretts March sale because she showed that she could run.)<br />Finally, Conley details the differences between a `natural' cover (Thoroughbreds), artificial insemination (A.I.) techniques (Standardbreds), and pasture breeding (semi-feral Shetland ponies). Speaking for myself, I wouldn't exactly use the word `natural' after reading that it usually takes five or six people plus a stallion, plus a twitched and hobbled mare to complete the breeding process.  Thoroughbred folks tend to be very conservative and have already rejected A.I. even though it is a safer, cheaper, and healthier method of getting mares in foal.d and hobbled mare to complete the breeding process.

Wilson has written a book not quite consonant with its title, &quot;Awful Ends.&quot;  Many of his chosen epitaphs are poignant rather than humorous or caustic.  For instance, the verse from Catherine Dyer in memory of her husband that begins:<br />My dearest dust, could not thy hasty day/ Afford thy drowszy patience leave to stay / One hower longer: so that we might either / Sate up, or gone to bedd together?<br />As an archeologist, Sir David was professionally involved with funerary inscriptions for over forty years.  He shares the good, the bad, and the banal in &quot;Awful Ends&quot;-- English epitaphs for the most part, a few written to memorialize people not quite dead.  This is the Earl of Rochester's impromptu verse on Charles II that was NOT inscribed on his sarcophagus in Westminster Abbey:<br />Here lies our mutton-eating king, / Whose word no man relies on; / Who never said a foolish thing, / Nor ever did a wise one.<br />For those of us who will probably not be entombed in the somber splendour of Westminster Abbey, we can be comforted by:<br />Here lie I at the Chancel door / Here lie I because I'm poor / The further in the more you'll pay / Here lie I as warm as they.<br />Cold comfort, perhaps.  Epitaph hunters should enjoy this gently ironic ramble through mossy English lych-yards.  For those of us who are contemplating our own demise, it might wise to choose our memorial verse in advance.  Otherwise we could end up with:<br />Sacred to the memory of / Captain Anthony Wedgwood / Accidentally shot by His Gamekeeper / Whilst out shooting. / &quot;Well done thou good and faithful servant.&quot;	2003-09-10

He also relates cases from Ceylon, Australia (the Sydney Shark affair), and other far-flung ports of the British Empire.<br />The author most especially seemed to relish his medico-legal battles with the famous Home Office Pathologist, Sir Bernard Spilsbury.  In one of his most interesting trials, Sir Sydney testified on behalf of Sidney Fox, a convicted forger, blackmailer, swindler, and thief who was also accused of murdering his own mother for the insurance money--she died less than an hour before her accidental death policy was due to expire.<br />Dear old mom was a confederate in most of her son's crimes, but Fox emphatically denied strangling her and setting her hotel room on fire, and Sir Sydney believed him. At least he believed that the con man's mother showed no physical evidence of strangulation.  He and the great Spilsbury locked horns over the forensic evidence in court and Sir Sidney's client was condemned to the gallows, but was it for the wrong reason?<br />The fact that Fox renewed his mother's accidental death policy the day before she died was the evidence that hung him, but was he really guilty of murdering her?  Sir Sidney thinks not.<br />Mordant wit abounds in this book, most especially in the chapter, &quot;Accident, Suicide, or Murder?&quot;  Sir Sidney relates the suicide by coal-gas of a plumber from Aberdeen who &quot;connected a tube to the gas-pipe before it entered the meter, and so all the way to the room where his body was found.&quot;<br />We've all heard stories about thrifty Scots, but Aberdonians seem to be a legend even amongst their own countrymen.<br />&quot;Mostly Murder&quot; contains several gruesome photographs from the author's forensic files, but nothing we haven't already seen on television.ho &quot;connected a tube to the gas-pipe before it entered the meter, and so all the way to the room where his body was found.&quot;<br />We've all heard stories about thrifty Scots, but Aberdonians seem to be a legend even amongst their own countrymen.<br />&quot;Mostly Murder&quot; contains several gruesome photographs from the author's forensic files, but nothing we haven't already seen on television.	2003-09-01

The violent death of King Ananda of Siam was one of his most famous cases.  At the opposite end of the notoriety scale was an incident involving the murder of a Shoreditch girl whose sister flung a bread knife at her.  As a pathologist, Simpson saw it all and wrote about it in clear, robust prose that does not spare his reader the gruesome details.<br /><br />The introductory chapter to &#34;Forty Years of Murder&#34; is &#34;Why choose Pathology?&#34;<br /><br />Professor Simpson goes on to answer his own question with a great deal of relish, even quoting Charles Wesley:  /Ah, lovely appearance of Death, /What sight upon earth is so fair? /Not all the gay pageants that breathe /Can with a dead body compare./<br /><br />If you can imagine the autobiography of Sherlock Holmes as ghost-written by Rabelais, you will acquire a good notion of Professor Simpson's style.  However, the best way to get an impression of the man and his methods is to read &#34;Forty Years of Murder.&#34;  (Skip the black-and-white photographs if you are squeamish.)  Simpson concentrates on several interesting cases, but also gives his reader a fascinating overview of homicide investigations as practiced in Great Britain (with a few side trips to Thailand, Portugal, Canada, and the Caribbean) from the late 1920s through the 1960s.<br /><br />In Chapter 19, &#34;The Innocence of Dr. Bodkin Adams&#34; there is an eerie foreshadowing of the recent case of Dr. Harold Shipman, the most prolific serial killer in British criminal history.  This Greater Manchester doctor was sentenced to life in prison for murdering fifteen of his middle aged and elderly women patients by lethal injection.  The police believe he may have killed as many as 150 patients during his thirty-year career.<br /><br />Dr. Bodkin Adams in &#34;Forty Years of Murder&#34; proved to be innocent of killing his elderly patients, but Simpson says doctors are in a particularly good position to commit murder and escape detection.  &#34;Their patients, sometimes their own fading wives, more often mere ageing nuisances, are in their sole hands.&#34;  A sudden &#34;grave turn for the worse&#34; or even death is for them alone to interpret.<br /><br />One wonders whether the murderous Dr. Shipman would have escaped detection as long as he did, if Professor Simpson had still been the British Home Office Pathologist.tors are in a particularly good position to commit murder and escape detection.  &#34;Their patients, sometimes their own fading wives, more often mere ageing nuisances, are in their sole hands.&#34;  A sudden &#34;grave turn for the worse&#34; or even death is for them alone to interpret.

Almost 27,000 people died on the morning of  May 8, 1902 because, according to this book's author, no one had ever heard of a nu&eacute;e ardente (pyroclastic flow) until after the destruction of Saint-Pierre.<br />Instead of a relatively sluggish stream of lava, a heavy ash-fall, or the earthquake plus tsunami that many were expecting (including the scientific commission appointed by the island's governor), Mount Pel&eacute;e exploded in a huge lateral blast of gas, dust, and rock.  The superheated cloud raced down the side of the volcano with the speed of a hurricane-force wind and headed directly for the port of Saint-Pierre about five miles away.<br />At 8:02 A.M., May 8, 1902 a businessman in Fort-de-France (an hour's boat trip down the coast of Martinique) was talking on the telephone with a friend in Saint-Pierre.  The businessman relates that his friend &quot;...had just finished his sentence, when I heard a dreadful scream, then another much weaker groan, like a stifled death rattle.&quot;<br />Then there was silence.  Nearly 27,000 people lay dead or dying at the other end of that telephone line, crushed by falling masonry, asphyxiated by the scalding breath of the nu&eacute;e ardente, or incinerated in the resulting inferno.  There were only two survivors in the city itself:  a shoemaker; and a prisoner in a solitary confinement cell who happened to be sheltered in the lee of a hill at the edge of the city.<br />Alwyn Scarth, former Professor of Geography at the University of Dundee begins &quot;La Catastrophe&quot; with the founding of Saint-Pierre in 1635, and the slaughter of the indigenous Carib population.  Unfortunately, the French settlers never paused to question the original inhabitants' choice of name for the mountain that loomed on their northern horizon.  'Mountain of Fire' was renamed 'Bald Mountain,' and the colonists moved on to develop an economy built on slaves, sugarcane and rum without questioning the lack of vegetation on Mount Pel&eacute;e's summit.<br />Minor eruptions occurred in 1792 and 1851, causing occasional curious picnickers to struggle up the volcano's slope for a view of the new sulphur vents (soufri&egrave;res) and hot springs.<br />Memories of those harmless volcanic sputterings contributed to a false sense of security among residents of Saint-Pierre when Mount Pel&eacute;e began hurling columns of ash into the air and steaming torrents of mud down her slopes in the spring of 1902.<br />When &quot;La Catastrophe&quot; appeared in 2002, along with other, similarly-themed books that were hastened onto the shelves (and the remainder tables) during  the centennial year of Saint-Pierre's destruction, its author separated himself from the pack by blaming the non-evacuation of the city on her residents' false sense of security, and on their ignorance of pyroclastic flows.  He thoroughly debunks the myth presented by some of his fellow-authors, that the inhabitants of Saint-Pierre were forced to stay in town because of a pending election.<br />Professor Scarth has produced a meticulously-researched account of the &quot;worst volcanic disaster of the 20th century.&quot;  It is my favorite among the centennial publications, although I found his exposition of the history and sociology of Martinique to be a bit dry.<br />Here are some of the other myths he discredits while telling the story of this catastrophe:<br />* Saint-Pierre was never called 'the Paris of the West Indies'--at least not before the 1902 eruption.<br />* There were more than two survivors.  Over a hundred people may have escaped alive from the August 8th nu&eacute;e ardente, although only two from the city proper.  Many of the survivors died shortly thereafter of their external burns and scalded lungs.<br />* Governor Mouttet was not a villain.  He acted courageously in visiting Saint-Pierre on the eveof the eruption, and died believing that the volcano was harmless.  The real villain of this story is the man who succeeded him.  The new governor had little sympathy for his constituents, and refused to evacuate the still-inhabited villages lying closest to the volcano.  Three months after the destruction of Saint-Pierre, Mount Pel&eacute;e climaxed another period of eruption with a gigantic nu&eacute;e ardente that claimed another 1085 victims.<br />* Don't be fooled by the photograph of the ruins on the back of the &quot;La Catastrophe's&quot; dustcover. Saint-Pierre is not a ghost city on the order of Pompeii.  According to the author, &quot;nowadays [it] is a hot and sleepy village of about 5000 people.&quot;cano was harmless.

The picture slowly evolves through a story of murder and revenge from beyond the grave.<br />&quot;Number 13&quot;--A scholar settles into a Danish hotel to research the town's ecclesiastical history and learns more than he ever wanted to know about a bishop who sold his soul to Satan.<br />&quot;Count Magnus&quot;-- Another story (along with &quot;Number 13&quot;) that may have had its origin in MRJ's trips to Scandinavia.  Mr. Wraxall, the scholarly hero of this tale dooms himself by reading a forbidden treatise of alchemy and expressing a wish to meet its long-dead (or not so dead) Swedish author.<br />&quot;'Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You, My Lad'&quot;-- A Professor takes a golfing vacation on England's East Coast, and agrees to take a look at the site of an ancient Templars' preceptory for an archeologically-inclined friend of his.

In this tale two middle-aged men are reminiscing about ghosts at boys' schools, and one relates a story of a schoolboy's revenge on a murderous master.<br />&quot;The Rose Garden&quot;-- Features one of MRJ's less sympathetic female characters.  The overbearing Mrs. Anstruther gets her supernatural comeuppance when she insists upon the removal of an old oak post in the rose garden.<br />&quot;The Tractate Middoth&quot;-- The young Mr. Garrett is asked to find a copy of the &quot;Tractate Middoth&quot; in a &quot;certain famous library&quot; and stumbles upon a cobwebby mystery.

In fact, the archdeacon's stall with its carvings of a cat, the King of Hell, and Death becomes a particularly haunting spot for the new prelate.<br />&quot;Mr Humphreys and His Inheritance&quot;-- Once installed as the new master of his deceased uncle's estate, Mr. Humphreys discovers the plan to an overgrown maze on his property.

He reconstructs the inscription on them to read: &quot;Penetrans Ad Interior Mortis.&quot;<br />&quot;The Diary of Mr Poynter&quot;--A book collector finds a sample of fabric in an old diary and decides to have it reproduced as curtains for his bedroom.<br />&quot;An Episode of Cathedral History&quot;--Mr. Lake is deputed to examine the archives of the Cathedral of Southminster, and is curious to see what the ancient building looks like at night.

Kidd) is an avid campanologist and many of the forty-seven stories in this collection involve ghostly encounters in or near Old English bell towers.  If you've read Dorothy Sayers's classic mystery, &quot;The Nine Tailors&quot; and thought you'd like to learn more about bell-ringing, &quot;Summoning Knells&quot; will cater to your whim in a satisfyingly supernatural manner.  Kidd's ghosts are modeled after those M. R. James, which is to say they are malignant and horrifying.  They are never chatty, cheerful, easily explained away, or too over the top in the blood-and-trailing-guts department, although Kidd is a shade less elegant than the Master.  She does go in for the occasional hand sinking into rotting flesh or &quot;a kiss without lips, just with rotten, crumbling teeth.&quot;<br />After a brief introduction and a Glossary of Bell-Ringing Terms, her stories are divided into the following categories:  &quot;Ghost Stories of a Campanologist;&quot; &quot;Other Jamesian Ghost Stories;&quot; and &quot;Other Ghost Stories.&quot;  Although I'm very fond of the bellringer tales, the second section contains some of my favorites, including the much-collected &quot;An Incident in the City,&quot; which also happens to be the first story Kidd ever published.  I still have nightmares about the scholar who bought an antique guide to London and decided to visit one of the old churches listed therein.<br />Who lies beneath the monument inscribed (in part): &quot;Now sleep unquiet neath this sod/ Yet call not on their master or on God&quot;?  Enter the sour, musty little church in the heart of the City with Sanford the antiquarian and his peculiar guide book, and see what you find.<br />Another story in this section, &quot;Old Hobby Horse&quot; is a fleshing-out (if that is the correct term to apply to a ghost story!) of a fragment by M.R. James from his &quot;Stories I Have Tried to Write.&quot;<br />&quot;Summoning Knells&quot; is yet another haunting piece of night music from the Ash-Tree Press.

James &amp; 2 of his less-collected stories	This book should have been called something like a 'Tribute to M.R. James.'  Of the two actual stories by M.R. James that are contained within this book, &quot;A Vignette&quot; might be a childhood memory rather than a work of fiction.  It has no plot and the setting very much resembles the rectory at Livermere Park where James grew up.  The second, very brief story, &quot;The Experiment&quot; was first published &quot;The Morning Post&quot; in 1931 and was uncollected in James's lifetime.<br />The remainder of this beguilingly eccentric book is made up of tributes to M.R. James by the actor Christopher Lee among others, medieval ghost stories that were collected by M.R. James, his essays on ghost stories and Sheridan Le Fanu, his recollection of a dream about a ghost, and ghost stories that he himself liked, e.g. &quot;The White and the Black&quot; by Erckmann-Chatrian.<br />A host of black-and-white photographs and engravings pertaining (sometimes, very loosely) to M. R. James adorn this small book (my copy is a hard-bound paperback, if that is not a contradiction in terms).  Many of them are reproductions of the original illustrations for his short stories but are alas, a bit too small and blurred to make out much detail.  There are also photographs from various cinematic adaptations of James's stories, photographs of Victorian ghosts that were probably familiar to the Master, reproductions of pamphlets that he may have read, etc., etc.<br />In short, those of you who have already read the collected works of M.R. James might be charmed by this little tribute.  If you have not yet read his stories, I recommend starting with an anthology such as &quot;Ghost Stories of an Antiquarian&quot; rather than this book.<br />For the true Jamesian fanatic, nothing but the Ash-Tree Press's &quot;A Pleasing Terror&quot; (2001), the complete and heavily annotated supernatural writings of M. R. James will suffice.	2003-08-06

Wallace's 'line' is the most convincing argument for evolution to emerge from the nineteenth century!<br />Before we finally settle into Batavia on the eve of the humongous explosion of the \\"island with a pointed mountain,\\" we also make a side-trip to Greenland with the author, in search of magnetite crystals.  You are going to know exactly why \\"more than six cubic miles of rock...hurled dozens of miles into the stratosphere\\" on August 27, 1883 by the time you read the author's gripping and prolonged description of the actual event.<br />Incidentally, Winchester explains the precise volcanological meaning of 'humongous.'  Suffice to say that it involves an explosion the size of the one he describes in this book.<br />Krakatoa (or more correctly 'Krakatau') lies in the Sunda strait between the islands of Java and Sumatra.  There had been previous eruptions before the 1883 explosion, and the author speculates on their dates, e.g. A.D. 416, and intensity.  In his final chapter, he also describes his own journey to the new island of Anak Krakatau (Son of Krakatau) which has been appearing and sometimes disappearing in the Indonesian archipelago since 1927.<br />Our author survives his trip to Anak Krakatau's main crater, \\"spread ahead like some infernal dish of hell,\\" but is almost done in by a six-foot lizard on the way back to his boat.  He manages to save himself with the sacrifice of a chicken sandwich.<br />\\"Krakatoa\\" is a very fine read, filled with mesmerizing details such as the floating rafts of pumice and skeletons that came ashore in Zanzibar in July, 1884, and the eerie behavior of ocean well before the volcano blew itself apart.  Maps, poetry, and black-and-white photographs accompany the text.main crater, \\"spread ahead like some infernal dish of hell,\\" but is almost done in by a six-foot lizard on the way back to his boat.

Kennel's &quot;Convection and Substorms:  Paradigms of Magnetospheric Phenomenology.&quot;  This third book, &quot;Interplanetary Magnetohydrodynamics&quot; is primarily intended for advanced graduate students and scientists who are not specialists in interplanetary physics.<br />My own particular interest in interplanetary physics was sparked by the incredible journeys of the Voyager spacecraft to the edge of our Solar System and beyond.  This book describes some of the fundamental structures and processes of the interplanetary medium that these brave voyagers helped to measure.  It deals with specific properties of the heliosphere (the region extending from the sun to the termination shock) as measured by the Voyagers and other spacecraft, and treats the interplanetary medium as a Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow.<br />(While the exact location of the termination shock is not known, it is now estimated to be located at about 90 ± 10 Astronomical Units (AU). Voyager 1 should reach 90 AU by the end of this year (2003).  What will it experience when it ventures beyond the solar system's interplanetary magnetic field and into interstellar space?)<br />&quot;Interplanetary Magnetohydrodynamics&quot; was published in 1995 and relies primarily on data from various Pioneers, Mariners, Helios 1 &amp; 2, Vela 3, and Voyager 1 &amp; 2, rather than a newer generation of spacecraft such as the rechristened RHESSI - the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager, which became operational on 02/12/2002, SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory), IMAGE  (Imager for Magnetopause to Aurora Global Exploration), and TRACE (Transition Region and Coronal Explorer spacecraft).  As a result, there is for example, no mention of the exciting new research on solar flares and the theory that they may be 'powered' by magnetic reconnections (a reexamination of the forty-year-old Sweet-Parker model).<br />However, this is more a book about the really large-scale structures of the heliosphere: the solar wind and the interplanetary magnetic field, the streams and interaction regions that corotate with the period of the sun's rotation, the shape of the heliospheric current sheet and its boundary conditions, and large-scale periodic fluctuations in the plasma and magnetic field.<br />Dr. Burlaga was a co-investigator on several of the magnetospheric and plasma cloud experiments performed by Helios 1 &amp; 2, Voyager 1&amp;2, Giotto (Comet Halley), etc., and is currently a Goddard Senior Fellow at the Interplanetary Physics Branch, Laboratory for Extraterrestrial Physics at the Goddard Space Flight Center.<br />If you're at all interested in solar sailing and want to know 'what the weather is like out there,' and if you have a good background in physics and calculus, &quot;Interplanetary Magnetohydrodynamics&quot; presents a detailed picture of our Sun's exotic and interesting environment.the theory that they may be 'powered' by magnetic reconnections (a reexamination of the forty-year-old Sweet-Parker model). <br />However, this is more a book about the really large-scale structures of the heliosphere: the solar wind and the interplanetary magnetic field, the streams and interaction regions that corotate with the period of the sun's rotation, the shape of the heliospheric current sheet and its boundary conditions, and large-scale periodic fluctuations in the plasma and magnetic field.<br />Dr. Burlaga was a co-investigator on several of the magnetospheric and plasma cloud experiments performed by Helios 1 &amp; 2, Voyager 1&amp;2, Giotto (Comet Halley), etc., and is currently a Goddard Senior Fellow at the Interplanetary Physics Branch, Laboratory for Extraterrestrial Physics at the Goddard Space Flight Center.<br />If you're at all interested in solar sailing and want to know 'what the weather is like out there,' and if you have a good background in physics and calculus, &quot;Interplanetary Magnetohydrodynamics&quot; presents a detailed picture of our Sun's exotic and interesting environment.	2003-07-30

Neurosurgery is an unforgiving craft, and not all of the stories in this book have a happy ending.  Neurosurgeons must tackle some pretty hopeless cases, and the human brain is a very unforgiving operating theatre.<br />Nevertheless, &quot;When the Air Hits Your Brain&quot; is an exhilarating read.  I've been through it twice now---once through a night when I had pretty much given up on sleep.  If you do intend to sleep, don't read it right before going to bed.<br />Here are the author's five rules for neurosurgery interns:<br />1. You &quot;ain't never&quot; the same when the air hits your brain.<br />2. The only minor operation is one that someone else is doing.<br />3. If the patient isn't dead, you can always make him worse if you try hard enough.<br />4. One look at the patient is better than a thousand phone calls from the nurse.<br />5. Operating on the wrong patient or doing the wrong side of the body makes for a very bad day--always ask the patient what side their pain is on, which leg hurts, which hand is numb.<br />Emotionally, Dr. Vertosick's worst rotation was to the local Children's Hospital.  A child who was born with an inoperable brain tumor is the focus of the chapter entitled &quot;Rebecca.&quot;<br />Read how the author strays into the 'inferno of overconfidence' as a chief resident, and comes &quot;perilously close to emotional incineration.&quot;  Follow him into the operating room as a patient's brain oozes through his fingers, where he is squirted in the eye by an AIDS patient's spinal fluid, and where he cures a woman who was misdiagnosed as an Alzheimer's patient when what she really had was a brain tumor.<br />Dr. Vertosick has written another, equally interesting book, &quot;Why We Hurt,&quot; on the 'natural history' of pain.	2003-07-26

(Short Story Index Reprint Series)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	&quot;Penetrans Ad Interior Mortis&quot;	The ghost stories of M.R. James (MRJ) are widely considered to be the best supernatural literature ever written.  &quot;More Ghost Stories of an Antiquary&quot; was his second collection of short stories to be published (1911) and includes seven tales of the supernatural.<br />However, you might want to spend a bit more money and buy the &quot;The Penguin Complete Ghost Stories of M.R. James.&quot;  If you completely succumb to the refined but potent horror of this author's writings, only &quot;A Pleasing Terror&quot; (Ash Tree Press 2001) will then do.  The latter book contains all of MRJ's supernatural literature, including story fragments that were never completed, biographies, bibliographies, commentary, and his fantasy novelette, &quot;The Five Jars.&quot;<br />&quot;More Ghost Stories of an Antiquary&quot; consists of the following stories, plus a brief preface by the author:<br />&quot;A School Story&quot;--MRJ was a dean at King's College, Cambridge and he supposedly wrote this story to entertain the King's College Choir.  I believe it is one of his shortest complete stories and it contains several ideas for further tales of the supernatural which were never followed up by MRJ himself.  In this tale two middle-aged men are reminiscing about ghosts at boys' schools, and one relates a story of a schoolboy's revenge on a murderous master.<br />&quot;The Rose Garden&quot;--Features one of MRJ's less sympathetic female characters.  The overbearing Mrs. Anstruther gets her supernatural comeuppance when she insists upon the removal of an old oak post in the rose garden.<br />&quot;The Tractate Middoth&quot;--The young Mr. Garrett is asked to find a copy of the &quot;Tractate Middoth&quot; in a &quot;certain famous library&quot; and stumbles upon a cobwebby mystery.  Find yourself a quiet, unpopulated corner in the stacks of an old library and see if you can read this story without looking behind you.  This is MRJ at his antiquarian best.<br />&quot;Casting the Runes&quot;--One of MRJ's most collected stories along with &quot;Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You, My Lad.&quot;  The villain of tale is sometimes assumed to be based on the self-styled 'Great Beast,' occultist Aleister Crowley.  He and MRJ might have crossed paths at Cambridge University although there seems to be no proof that the scholarly Dean ever met the so-called 'wickedest man in the world.'  At any rate, this is a tale of a man who unwittingly angers a sorcerer.<br />&quot;The Stalls of Barchester Cathedral&quot;--This story begins with the obituary of the Venerable John Benwell Haynes, Archdeacon of Sowerbridge and Rector of Pickhill and Candley.  He succeeded to his position upon the rather mysterious demise of Archdeacon Pulteney in 1810, but does not find much enjoyment in his new job.  In fact, the archideacon's stall with its carvings of a cat, the King of Hell, and Death becomes a particularly haunting spot for the new prelate.<br />&quot;Martin's Close&quot;--The bit of land referred to in the story's title is &quot;one of the smallest enclosures you are likely to see.&quot;  It consists of a pond that is hedged all around with no gate or entrance.  The tale of its haunting is told primarily through a court record from the time of Lord Chief Justice Jeffreys, he of the infamous 'Bloody Assize' that followed the Monmouth Rebellion.  In spite of this rather awkward structure, it is a very frightening tale of supernatural revenge.<br />&quot;Mr Humphreys and His Inheritance&quot;--Once installed as the new master of his deceased uncle's estate, Mr. Humphreys discovers the plan to an overgrown maze on his property.  He decides to investigate the old landscaping feature, which was erected by one of his most notorious ancestors.  Mr. Humphreys also discovers a set of stone blocks that were once part of the maze.

This book contains all of MRJ's supernatural literature, including story fragments that were never completed, biographies, bibliographies, commentary, and his fantasy novelette, \\"The Five Jars.\\"<br />\\"Ghost Stories of an Antiquary\\" consists of the following stories:<br />\\"Canon Alberic's Scrap-book\\"--The original title for this story was 'A Curious Book,' and it is one of 'the' classical MRJ invocations of a scholar who unwittingly opens the wrong book and pays horribly for his misadventure.  This story and the following \\"Lost Hearts\\" were originally read aloud at an 1897 meeting of the Cambridge Chitchat Society, a literary gathering which met for \\"the promotion of rational conversation.\\"<br />\\"Lost Hearts\\"--This story is unusual for MRJ in that the ghosts participate in an actual physical assault on the villain who had murdered them. It is narrated in the third person by a little boy who is orphaned and goes to live with his elderly cousin at Aswarby Hall (an actual estate in Lincolnshire, now largely demolished).  Slowly he begins to realize that there were two other children who had lived with his cousin before him.<br />\\"The Mezzotint\\"--A collector of topographical pictures purchases a mezzotint that shows a view of a manor-house from the early part of the eighteenth century.  The picture slowly evolves through a story of murder and revenge from beyond the grave.<br />\\"The Ash-tree\\"--If your Bible falls open to the verse, \\"Thou shalt seek me in the morning, and I shall not be\\" do not, I repeat DO NOT sleep in Sir Matthew's old bedroom next to the ancient ash-tree.  This story is a unique reworking of the \\"executed witch's revenge\\" theme.<br />\\"Number 13\\"--A scholar settles into a Danish hotel to research the town's ecclesiastical history and learns more than he ever wanted to know about a bishop who sold his soul to Satan.<br />\\"Count Magnus\\"--Another story (along with \\"Number 13\\") that may have had its origin in MRJ's trips to Scandinavia.  Mr. Wraxall, the scholarly hero of this tale dooms himself by reading a forbidden treatise of alchemy and expressing a wish to meet its long-dead (or not so dead) Swedish author.  This tale is definitely not for the faint-hearted, especially the scene in the mausoleum of Count Magnus, when the locks start popping off of the sarcophagus.<br />\\"Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You, My Lad\\"--A Professor takes a golfing vacation on England's East Coast, and agrees to take a look at the site of an ancient Templars' preceptory for an archeologically-inclined friend of his.  He scratches around in the ruins and finds a whistle with a Mediaeval Latin inscription on it that can be translated (according to Jamesian scholar Jacqueline Simpson) as: \\"O thief, you will polish it, you will blow it twice, you will regret this, you will go mad.\\"  I think this is the first M. R. James story I ever read, and it terrified me.  I can't remember how long I had to sleep with the lights on after reading it.<br />\\"The Treasure of Abbot Thomas\\"--Mr. Somerton deciphers a text from the medieval Latin 'Sertum Steinfeldense Norbertinum,' and an inscription in the painted-glass window of a private chapel, then goes on a treasure hunt to Germany.

He studied biology at Yale University, received his Ph.D. in political science from MIT, and served in the State Department, the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.  So, although his descriptions of past epidemics are horrible enough, it's the present and future threat of smallpox---the second half of this book---where Tucker really scared the bejabbers out of me.  I had no idea that the Soviet bioweapons program, Vector, had gone as far as it did in developing viral weapons.  According to the author, &quot;Some 4,500 people, including about 250 Ph.D.-level scientists, worked at Vector in the late 1980s...One goal of the...program was to develop a smallpox-based biological weapon containing virulence genes from Ebola hemorrhagic fever virus.  At least theoretically, such a viral chimera would combine the hardiness and transmissibility of smallpox with the lethality of Ebola, which was between 90 percent and 100 percent fatal, resulting in an 'absolute' biological weapon.&quot;<br />The real irony of the Vector bioweapons program was that the Soviet Union (along with the United States) was a major factor in eradicating the scourge of smallpox from the world in the 1970s.<br />Where are those 4,500 people who worked at Vector, now?  Where is the twenty tons of smallpox virus formulation that was stocked at the Center of Virology in Zagorsk?  The Soviets supposedly destroyed the stockpile in the late 1980s, but the smallpox seed cultures and the expertise to manufacture biological weapons from them still remain.<br />The author clearly presents the arguments for and against retaining the known remaining smallpox virus stocks in Atlanta and Moscow.  However, I believe he sides with the 'destructionists' rather than the 'retentionists':  &quot;From a practical standpoint, now that the DNA sequences of representative strains of variola virus hade been determined, the live virus was no longer needed to identify smallpox if it were to reappear in the future.  Nor would live variola [smallpox] virus be required to protect against a future outbreak of smallpox, since the small pox vaccine--based on the distinct vaccinia virus--could be retained and stockpiled for insurance purposes.&quot;<br />The long, difficult task of eliminating smallpox from the world (as thrillingly described in &quot;Scourge&quot;) will not be complete until all known and rogue virus stocks (believed held by North Korea, Iran, Iraq, and possibly China) are destroyed.  The world's population has grown increasingly vulnerable to the disease since the last official vaccination programs were eliminated in 1984, as the protective immunity induced by the vaccine lasts only about seven to ten years.  Nor is there an effective medical treatment for smallpox.<br />As Tucker states in his closing sentence:  &quot;Until humanity's legal and moral restraints catch up with its scientific and technological achievements, the eradication of smallpox will remain as much a cautionary tale as an inspirational one.&quot;s hade been determined, the live virus was no longer needed to identify smallpox if it were to reappear in the future.

Spine-Tingling Hair Raising Tales	Books	2	1	2	N	Y	Really awful stories	Rarely have I come across an author as energetic as Penny Love, who claims to be an &quot;internationally recognized psychic.&quot;  She'll do anything to get her reader's attention.  If you see her heave a beer bottle at your head, get out of the way because the piano is going to come flying at you next.  Let me illustrate her technique from her first story: &quot;The Kissing Hag.&quot;<br />Not only is a pregnant woman buried alive in this story, she is put in her coffin with her legs tied together so that she can't give birth before she dies.  So she smashes the coffin lid and performs a Caesarian on herself with a splinter of wood.  She cuts the umbilical cord, thrusts the baby out onto the ground and dies.  Someone hears the baby crying in the moonlight, picks it up and carries it off without noticing anything else unusual in the immediate area (like a hand or a coffin lid sticking out of the ground).<br />How did Stephen King manage to miss a plot like this?<br />The author tells a very visual story, with earthworms slithering out of eyesockets and hands that are shoved through rotting chests.  Nothing is left to the imagination of the reader.  The ghosts are quite talkative (maybe I should say 'hissative' because they usually hiss their words).  While the ordinary characters are sobbing or screaming or vomiting with disgust, the ghost is in their face, hissing out its need to torment them.  The ghost's story of violent death usually plays out through a form of hypnosis that starts with, 'Look deeply into my eyesockets...'<br />An amazing number of people get beaten to death, gang-raped, drowned, and buried alive in this book.  If you are looking for subtlety, characterization, or any of the gentler emotions in your supernatural stories, I suggest you look elsewhere.	2003-07-14

James	&quot;Whispers in the Dark (1992)&quot; is a novel-length version of M. R. James's ghost story &quot;Lost Hearts.&quot;  It's not my favorite Aycliffe by any means, but even his so-so ghost stories are better than most of the supernatural literature on today's market.<br />'Whispers' has a standard gothic romance plotline:  Victorian girl is sent to workhouse when her father dies and leaves his family in debt.  She escapes from the workhouse (really, the scenes in the workhouse are very well researched and some of the scariest writing in the book) and goes into service as a maid.  Soon she runs away to find her beloved brother who supposedly made his way to the estate of distant relatives.  She is taken in and cosseted by the distant and very rich relatives, but all is not well.<br />For one thing, her brother seems to have vanished.  Soon Charlotte begins to hear someone crying in the night.  Someone scratches at her window at midnight, and she sees a shadow crawling across the lawn that separates the mansion from the family graveyard.  Her two relatives are in total denial about any supernatural goings-on, and of course the staff won't talk.<br />Then she finds a diary hidden behind one of the shutters in her bedroom.<br />In the course of writing this review, I began to realize that &quot;Lost Hearts&quot; isn't the only M. R. James story that Aycliffe might have borrowed from.  The hairy something that Charolotte touches when she reaches for her matches mirrors a scene in &quot;Casting the Runes&quot; and a similar scene in &quot;The Diary of Mr Poynter.&quot;  The thing crawling across the lawn also crawls across the lawn in &quot;The Mezzotint.&quot;  The evil James Ayrton is a ringer for none other than M. R. James's undead  Count Magnus.<br />Oh well, the reason I read Aycliffe in the first place is because his stories are written in the Jamesian tradition, and &quot;Whispers in the Dark&quot; descends to even darker realms concerning the afterlife than the biblical scholar James ever dared to venture.<br />Jonathan Aycliffe, whose real name is Denis McEoin also writes under the pseudonym 'Daniel Easterman.'

You enter a rich forest of metaphor, sometimes only partially glimpsed but always beautiful.  A standard fairy-tale plot is overgrown with jeweled birds and foxes with little golden crowns--Kinuko Y. Craft's cover art is a perfect match for McKillip's writing--but the story's end might still come as a surprise.<br />The prince and princess both have some growing up to do through the labyrinthine course of the book.  I picked the wrong villain, someone very like the villain in McKillip's &quot;Song for a Basilisk&quot; but who is redeemed in this book by his love for the kingdom of Serre.<br />Speaking of villains, see if you can guess whose heart was enclosed in a casket inside the ribcage of a dragon---you also need guess where it went after the wizards Gyre and Unciel opened the casket.  Many hearts go missing throughout the story and not all of them are returned to their true owners.<br />The Baba Yaga-like witch, Brume and her walking hovel, and her chickens, and her stewpot full of human bones form a striking counterpoint to the beautiful firebird-woman who flies through the Forest of Serre and steals men's hearts with her song.  Are either or both of them evil?  Are they two faces of the same wild magic?  McKillip doesn't give a direct answer to these questions (at least none that I could discern) so you'll have to decide for yourself as you read her story.  Both Prince Ronan and Princess Sidonie have to face their own worst fears in Brume's hut, and they are different people when they finally emerge.<br />The firebird seems to enter and escape the Crone's hut at will--another of McKillip's symbols for death and rebirth, or change?<br />Incidentally, only the men in this story are seduced by the nameless firebird.<br />&quot;In the Forests of Serre&quot; is one of McKillip's loveliest and most mysterious fantasies.  Even if you don't care for all of that la-de-da love-lost-and-found stuff, or for the book's dense symbolism, you might still enjoy the goings-on of the Wizard Unciel and his bumbling-but-honest scribe Euan Ash.  None of this author's characters do quite what you expect of them.<br />I'm not even sure there was a villain.st-and-found stuff, or for the book's dense symbolism, you might still enjoy the goings-on of the Wizard Unciel and his bumbling-but-honest scribe Euan Ash.

The introduction is written by Norman Friedman, not 'Griedman.' Secondly, it is published by the Naval Institute Press in Annapolis, Maryland not \\"Life\\" magazine, although many of the photographs were taken by the staff of \\"Life.\\"<br />This book consists of journals 1 through 6 (out of a total of 24) which were originally issued in September 1943 - February 1944 and were intended primarily for (in fact, restricted to) readers in the United States Armed Forces. According to Norman Friedman, \\"it is a great introduction to the much more detailed literature on the technology of World War II ships, aircraft, and armored vehicles.\\"<br />I would think that the literature doesn't get much more detailed than this. Black-and-white photographs and diagrams are to be found in multiples on every page of this 9.5 x 13 inch hardbound reprint. The very first page of journal #1 has a quiz called the \\"All-in Raid\\" where the reader is invited to identify the silhouettes of 62 planes that are about to fly right over his head (\\"For answers see p.50.\\") The very first article, \\"No Margin for Error\\" concerns the vital need to be able to recognize vehicles of war (planes, tanks, ships, etc.) from any angle.<br />Then we turn the page and are instructed on the identification of Britain's \\"newest transport,\\" the RAF's York (along with five photographs that show the difference between the York, its parent Lancaster, and the older Manchester).<br />Most of the articles are two pages long, including the photographs, diagrams, cutaway drawings, etc. A bit of history, e.g. \\"Sherman was best in North Africa\\" is also crammed onto each page of text, and many of the photographs were taken in actual combat.<br />Some WWII 'trivia' is also included, such as a photograph of the medal that was presented to a Kingfisher scout-plane pilot who dropped his depth charges on what proved to be whale, not an enemy submarine.<br />This is a fascinating book. Read it and you too will be the only person on your ship who can spot the difference between the silhouette of an Admiral Hipper class heavy cruiser and its very close cousin, the Prinz Eugen class heavy cruiser (answer: \\"a more broken aft section\\" on the latter.)and you too will be the only person on your ship who can spot the difference between the silhouette of an Admiral Hipper class heavy cruiser and its very close cousin, the Prinz Eugen class heavy cruiser (answer: \\"a more broken aft section\\" on the latter.)	2003-07-05

Burrage, who also published under the pseudonym &quot;Ex-private X&quot; was primarily a writer of gently humorous love stories, but is now chiefly known for his supernatural fiction.  Many of his stories were republished in that great series, &quot;The Nth Fontana Book of Great Ghost Stories&quot; (I believe they made it all the up to N = 20 -- If you're a ghost story fanatic, collect these titles wherever you can, especially those edited by R Chetwynd-Hayes).  &quot;Smee&quot; is probably his most collected title and nothing in this book rises to quite that level, although &quot;The Green Bungalow,&quot; &quot;Warning Whispers (from which the book's title is derived),&quot; and &quot;The Witch of Oxshott&quot; will all send a few tremors down your spine.<br />At his best, Burrage wraps the terror-meter needle to the level of fellow British supernatural writer, E. F. Benson.  At his most insipid, he combines the ghostly with a touch of humor (&quot;The Imperturbable Tucker&quot;) or romance (&quot;Fellow Travellers&quot;).  These two stories will probably make you smile rather than shiver, but they are well worth reading.<br />&quot;Warning Whispers&quot; is a good, ghostly collection in the pre-WWII British manner.  I wouldn't recommend it for the Stephen King 'smash their eyeballs' fans.	2003-07-03

This book is his story of how he renovated the racetrack, starting in 1969, then took on the legislative, judicial, and executive branches of the Massachusetts government to haul Thoroughbred racing, kicking and screaming out of the Dark Ages--or more accurately out of the Age of Puritans.<br />He succeeded in his battles against the government (thanks mainly to the judicial branch) but was finally done in by his own holding company, Realty Equities.  The bittersweet final chapter describes the farewell party he threw for his friends who had joined him in his two-year, and ultimately bankrupted racetrack venture.<br />It was a wild two-year ride and Veeck is a very colorful character, even when he is talking about holding companies and Boston politics.  During his tenure at the track, he had the pay toilets and artificial flowers banned from the facility, staged chariot races and livestock giveaways (Brahma bulls and a Thoroughbred).  There was also going to be a reenactment of Custer's last stand, which alas was rained out (Veeck didn't have much luck with the weather during his tenure).  He also inaugurated what was then the richest turf race in the world, the Yankee Gold Cup, won by the French horse, Jean-Pierre (so there are a few horses mentioned in this book, just not as many as you might be led to believe by the title).<br />My biggest disappointment was that Veeck didn't talk at all about the day-to-day management of the stables.  This is a book about high finance, dirty politics, and really crazy ways of drawing crowds to a racetrack.<br />I think the National Thoroughbred Racing Association (NTRA) could learn a great deal from Bill Veeck if only they would cease their internal squabbling long enough to read &quot;Thirty Tons a Day.&quot;  I only wish he were still around to whack some sense into the Thoroughbred racing business.cing Association (NTRA) could learn a great deal from Bill Veeck if only they would cease their internal squabbling long enough to read &quot;Thirty Tons a Day.&quot;  I only wish he were still around to whack some sense into the Thoroughbred racing business.	2003-07-02

He outlasted all of his great compatriots from the 1970s and was, according to his trainer Buddy Delp, &quot;the greatest horse ever to look through a bridle.&quot;  You don't have to agree with Mr. Delp to enjoy this book since Bid was also ranked the tenth greatest American Thoroughbred of the Twentieth Century by &quot;The Blood Horse&quot; magazine.  Out of his compatriots, only Secretariat (second), Forego (eighth), and Seattle Slew (ninth) were placed ahead of this great, gray race horse.  And we could argue all day about whether Affirmed (twelfth) should have been placed ahead of him, too.<br />Author Timothy T. Capps has served as an executive with Matchmaker, a company that sold stallion seasons and shares, and his book reveals a bias (more so than others in this Thoroughbred Legends series) toward the breeding side of the Thoroughbred business.  This emphasis is a bit peculiar in Spectacular Bid's case since this champion on the track was not considered a great success in the breeding shed.  He started out strongly, siring twenty-eight stakes winners from his first four crops when his book included some of the nation's finest broodmares.  Then his yearling prices and stud fee began their long decline.  Bid offspring took a relatively long time to develop and that was the kiss of death as far as the commercial breeders were concerned.  They were (and are) looking for brilliant two-year-olds and Classics contenders.<br />Spectacular Bid also covered sport mares his last several years. He closed out his career standing for $3,500 in New York and covered ten mares this year.<br /><br />His glory days were on the track, and his racing career is my favorite part of this book.  He won 26 out of 30 races and was a champion all three years that he raced.  He was held in such high esteem by the betting public that he went off at 1-20 eight times during his career and 1-10 five times.<br />Bid was the greatest of the 'almost' Triple Crown winners, and Capps handles Delp's story about the safety pin on Belmont Day with great tact.  A retired trainer once told me that nobody on the backside believed there really was a safety pin.  They reckoned that if Bid had been properly trained up to the Belmont (a too-fast work on the Monday before the Belmont saw &quot;a fatigued horse going back to the barn&quot;) and if he had gotten a decent ride during the race itself--well, we would have seen three Triple Crown winners in a row, instead of two.<br />This book pays fitting tribute to the great son of Bold Bidder and Spectacular, most especially in the author's chapter on Bid's brilliant undefeated, weight-carrying, recording-setting four-year-old season.<br />NOTE:  The oldest living winner of a Triple Crown race is now Coastal (27), the colt who defeated Spectacular Bid in the Belmont.ced.

The liner notes warn you to be careful about wrapping the headphone leads around your neck because you may fall asleep before the CD ends.  This is exactly what happened to me, so I stopped using headphones.<br />I'm missing out on the &quot;hypnotic echoed affirmations&quot; without the headphones, but at least I won't accidentally strangle myself in my sleep.<br />One thing that might keep you awake initially is the hypnotherapist Glenn Harrold's incredible Cockney accent.  Maybe I've watched &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; one too many times, but when I initially started listening to &quot;Deep Sleep Every Night,&quot; I kept expecting Henry Higgins to cut in with, &quot;My dear man, the rain in Spain stays mainly on...etc.&quot;<br />An annoying intrusion (not Henry Higgins!) that might wake you up after you've fallen asleep is the beginning of the second track, &quot;Lucid Dreams for Problem Solving.&quot;  I believe track two was originally a separate tape, and Mr. Harrold reverts back to his normal speaking voice when the track begins.  He's jolted me awake a couple of times, but I've always gone back to sleep as he reverts to his sonorous, repetitive murmurings.<br />The total CD running time is forty-three minutes, and I haven't stayed away through the whole thing, yet.  There's nothing too mysterious about it:  Mr. Harrold starts out with controlled breathing exercises, then onto suggestions about relaxing various parts of the body from head to toes, then a soothing, repetitious murmur about the conscious mind versus the unconscious mind.  This is where I always fall asleep--until the second track begins.<br />If you have problems falling asleep, you might want to give this CD a try.  It seems to be working for me.	2003-06-28

Where they overlap, it is in every point of the overlap.\\"<br />\\"News of the Universe\\" was originally issued as a Sierra Club book and contains poems selected (and sometimes translated) by Robert Bly. The book is worth buying just for Bly's introduction and his analysis of 'Dover Beach'. Frequently, I find myself dipping into \\"News of the Universe\\" for inspiration (like a Protestant choosing a random verse from the Bible). I keep this book at work for the times when I feel really out of touch with the Natural World. Then I open up \\"News of the Universe\\" and find (for instance):<br />_________________________________________________________________<br />In the heart of man/There sleeps a green worm/That has spun the heart about itself,/And that shall dream itself black wings/One day to break free into the beautiful black sky. - Galway Kinnell.<br />_________________________________________________________________<br />The poems that Bly selected for this book make me feel less isolated from the Universe. The poems ring true. They refresh. Since that was Bly's stated intention when he collected the poems, you ought to try them yourself and see if they work for you.<br />There is also a sense of the presence of Death in them--what Bly defines by the Spanish word \\"Duende\\" in another one of his anthologies--so much so, that many of the poems in this book can be used as elegies.	2003-06-14

My copy (which originally belonged to my father) dates from 1931 and its story was originally published in six parts in the \\"Blue Book Magazine\\" from May to September 1930.  It is wonderful to see these books reissued, as they are the progenitors of many, if not all of the heroic fantasy serials that take up so much room on modern bookshelves.  Edgar Rice Burroughs (ERB) was the first and also (in my opinion) the best writer of multi-volume fantasies.<br />'Fighting Man' is the seventh book in ERB's Mars series and differs from most volumes in the series in that John Carter, gentleman of Virginia and Warlord of Barsoom (Mars) is only a peripheral figure.<br /><br />The adventure is narrated in the first person by Hadron of Hastor, a warrior in the service of John Carter.  Hadron's family is rich in honor but not in material possessions and when he falls in love with the wealthy Sanoma Tora, she snubs him.  For months, the soldierly Hadron haunts the palace of Tor Hatan, Sanoma Tora's father, but his hope of winning her are vanishingly small until she is abducted one night by a mysterious flier.<br />The strange ship is armed with a weapon that disintegrates the metal of a pursuing flier, and the Warlord realizes that there is now a new weapon of mass destruction let loose upon the dying seas of Barsoom (it's hard not to adopt ERB's style after reading one of his books).<br />Hadron is promised Sanoma Tora's hand if he can rescue her. The Warlord dispatches the doughty warrior in search of his love, and asks him to keep an eye peeled for the new metal-disintegrator weapon.<br />Since this story was originally written to be serialized, there is a cliff-hanger at the end of every chapter.  Hadron's flier is shot down by the terrible green warriors of Barsoom.  He escapes and is trapped in a deserted tower by a man-eating white ape.  He escapes, rescues a slave named Tavia from the green men and the two of them take to the air in Tavia's flier.<br />Unfortunately, they are forced to land in the demesne of a very paranoid tyrant.  While Hadron is confined in the tyrant's Pit, he learns the secret of the invisible metal-disintegrating ray from a fellow prisoner.<br />Hadron, now under a sentence of death must escape to save both Sanoma Tora and all of Helium (John Carter's Barsoomian kingdom).<br />Our hero battles his way across the dead seas of Barsoom, evading or slaughtering cruel tyrants, mad scientists, formidably-tusked green warriors, etc. until the final reaches of chapter seventeen when he resolves all of the plot lines and finds his own true love (not who you might think).<br /><br />'Fighting Man' has all of the color and breathless dash of its predecessors in ERB's Mars chronicles.  It's okay to start your adventure on Barsoom with 'Fighting Man,' although I would strongly recommend beginning at the first volume, \\"A Princess of Mars.\\"  'Fighting Man' can stand alone because ERB includes a long forward in which he describes the flora, fauna, principal races, and wars of Barsoom.cues a slave named Tavia from the green men and the two of them take to the air in Tavia's flier. <br />Unfortunately, they are forced to land in the demesne of a very paranoid tyrant.

I just purchased a book about Thoroughbred racing whose author can't distinguish a horse's leg from its gaskin.  Is it all downhill from page 9?  Well, not quite...<br />If you skip the first three chapters, the 'helpful hints' and the 'fun facts,' there are some interesting stretches in this book, usually when the author is interviewing a real expert in the Thoroughbred business.  My favorite vignette came from trainer, Jenine Sahadi, who pours half-a-cup of red wine into her horse's feed to make it taste better, and to relax the horse.  She buys her vino by the gallon at Price Club, so her Thoroughbreds are not likely to end their careers as maitre d's in some fancy French restaurant (although in France, they may end up as the plat du jour.)<br />A couple of other favorite interviews in &quot;Win, Place and Show&quot; were with jockey, Jerry Bailey (read about the race where the starting gate was left on the track) and track announcer, Tom Durkin whose job is a lot harder than it sounds.  If you don't believe me try to catch a race on ESPN when the sound feed from the track announcer fails, and the T.V. commentators have to call the race.<br />As might be expected, the &quot;Daily Racing Form&quot; is mentioned roughly a zillion times throughout this book, and even has a whole chapter devoted to it (&quot;Daily Racing Form:  The Horseplayer's Bible&quot;).  As also might be expected, the most detailed information in this book concerns the handicapping of races and different forms of wagering.<br />For some reason, there's also a chapter on &quot;How to Throw a Great Kentucky Derby Party&quot; that could have been subtitled &quot;Assuming you have lots of time and money and very little taste&quot;--a forty-foot cloth-of-gold pyramid?  C'mon!<br />The &quot;Glossary of Racing Terms&quot; at book's end is courtesy of NTRA Communications, and I think they need to do a little buffing up on some of them, e.g. 'black.'  &quot;Black:  a horse color that is black, including the muzzle, flanks, mane, tail, and legs unless white markings are present.&quot;<br />I finished &quot;Win, Place and Show&quot; almost as confused as when I began.-of-gold pyramid?

It allows you to design beautiful frames, invitations, carved boxes, greeting cards, pillows--let your imagination run wild!  I used this book to design watercolor frames.<br />The author divided up her chapters according to the knotwork design's basic construction unit, e.g. small loops, hearts, fish, corner motifs, etc.  There is also a chapter on &quot;Creating Your Own Designs&quot; and one on &quot;Using Knotwork Designs in Other Crafts.&quot;<br />All of the illustrated patterns are based on angles of 45, 90, and 180 degrees and are plotted on a dotted grid, which makes them fairly easy to resize and replicate on graph paper.  All you need in addition to the graph paper is a pencil and the ability to find a quiet spot and concentrate on your design.<br />The many colored illustrations are beautiful, and the knotwork diagrams are easy to follow if you give them the attention they deserve!

At age nineteen he visited a race track one day and fell in love with the horses. He didn't get to ride right away, though. He started out by mucking stalls and had to work his way up the ranks to acquire his jockey's license. He became the top rider at the Hipodromo Monterico in Peru, then decided to try his luck in America. It took Jorge roughly ten years in the States before he started to get the top horses. Nowadays, if you watch any of the big grade-one races, you're almost sure to spot Chavez, whose unique riding style has earned him the nickname, 'Chop Chop.' His first Derby winner was Monarchos, so if you'd like to learn more about Chavez, read \\"Horse of a Different Color\\" by Jim Squires.<br />The tragic story of Chris Antley opens this book, balanced by the more hopeful and unfinished story of Pat Valenzuela, who has come back out of the hell of addiction and is riding top horses once more. Good luck, Pat!<br />Lenny Shulman tells the stories of fourteen top jockeys in all: Chris Antley; Jerry Bailey; Russell Baze; Jorge Chavez; Pat Day; Eddie Delahoussaye (Patient Eddie is one of my all-time favorites); Kent Desormeaux; Mark Guidry; Chris McCarron; Corey Nakatani; Laffit Pincay, Jr.; Mike Smith; Gary Stevens; and Patrick Valenzuela. Reading these biographies will give you an appreciation of the physical suffering these jocks go through to stay at the top of their game. I personally feel they are the best, bravest professional athletes in the world---they and their Thoroughbred mounts.<br />I had one minor problem with this book in that it didn't spend enough time on the horses. I would have liked to hear all of the top jocks talk about their best mounts. Some do, but not all, and not in enough detail to get a flavor for what it's like pounding down the track at thirty-five miles an hour, balanced on the tips of your riding boots, and trying to squeeze your thousand-pound mount into a hole between two other horses whose jockeys don't want to let you through.<br />Whew! Even without those added details, \\"Ride of Their Lives\\" is well worth reading.rites); Kent Desormeaux; Mark Guidry; Chris McCarron; Corey Nakatani; Laffit Pincay, Jr.; Mike Smith; Gary Stevens; and Patrick Valenzuela.

It contained exactly what we needed to learn.  We even ended up singing the authors' &quot;Little Black Flies&quot; song a few times ourselves--see Chapter Nineteen, &quot;A Disquisition on Some (Justly) Unsung Creatures of the Woods.&quot;  This chapter not only contains the black flies song (&quot;Black flies, little black flies/ Rum bum umble dum little black flies...&quot;) but also charts a technique for unobtrusively shagging your black flies off onto an unsuspecting decoy, e.g. your husband or the guide.  Priceless.  This is the kind of stuff you really need to know if you're planning any kind of camp-out north of Indiana.<br />The authors had to portage around thirty-two sets of rapids (not easy with a canoe balanced on your head) on their trip down the entire length of Labrador's Moisie River.  They include invaluable information on trail-finding (if there is a trail) and bushwack portages, accomplished with &quot;compass, map, and horse-sense.&quot;  (Nowadays, one might also use a GPS device).  One of the suggestions if you happen to be looking for the next lake across the watershed, is to head for the point on the horizon where the trees dip the lowest, &quot;but not if the topo shows it to be the Dismal Swamp.&quot;<br />Just remember that you may be bushwacking the next body of paddleable water with the center thwart of a canoe across your shoulders.  You won't have a lot of energy for sight-seeing.<br />If you are going to traverse a well-known river, you might not have to read the chapters on &quot;Scouting&quot; and &quot;Lining.&quot;  However, it might still be a good idea to know the information they contain, just in case your 'well-known' river is running high or very low.<br />Jim, Rug, Joe, and Peach (the 'wilderness paddlers') also spend a great deal of time demonstrating via diagrams and text, the tactics and strokes for handling all conditions of still and wild water--the Moise River had them all--not to mention ice, haystacks, eddy lines, souse holes, curlers, and roosters.<br />There is also advice on bailing techniques, and how to recover when your canoe capsizes.<br />This book is 'the' classic for anyone who wants to take off into the Wilderness and do some heavy-duty paddling.  It's authoritative, extremely detailed, and also enormously fun to read.via diagrams and text, the tactics and strokes for handling all conditions of still and wild water--the Moise River had them all--not to mention ice, haystacks, eddy lines, souse holes, curlers, and roosters.<br />There is also advice on bailing techniques, and how to recover when your canoe capsizes. <br />This book is 'the' classic for anyone who wants to take off into the Wilderness and do some heavy-duty paddling.

After all, fairy tales are not just for kids.  And they're not for wimpy adults, either.  Just read \\"The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales\\" by Maria Tatar if you don't believe me.  \\"Stardust\\" has some pretty Grimm stuff in it too, however the only people who might not enjoy it are those who take Unicorns very very seriously.  Or are extremely fond of billy goats.<br />Gaiman's story begins and ends with a fair that will remind you of Christina Rossetti's \\"Goblin Market\\":<br />\\"Backwards up the mossy glen/ Turned and trooped the goblin men,/ With their shrill repeated cry,/ \\"Come buy, come buy.\\".../<br />As Laura of \\"Goblin Market\\"-fame learned, it is better not to sample the merchandise at such  Unseelie gatherings.  Dunstan Thorn, who \\"was not romantic\\" learns this lesson too, when nine months after the \\"Stardust\\" fair, a baby is abandoned at the boundary between Faerie and the English village of Wall with his name pinned to its blanket.  Thus begins the story of Tristan Thorn who is raised as a proper Victorian lad until age seventeen.  Unlike his father, Tristan is romantic and at the bequest of the most beautiful girl in Wall, he sets out on a quest through the Land of Faerie to fetch her a fallen star.  Not just any fallen star, but the one Tristan and Victoria both saw on the night she refused to kiss him.<br />\\"Stardust\\" is stuffed with stock fairy tale creatures who have been blown loose from their moorings and brought to life in the most wildly imaginative way.  Some of them make only token appearances, but all are memorable.  Two of the most poignant are the boy who is turned into a billy goat, and a billy goat, turned into a boy.  There are three truly evil witches, and one who is only so-so wicked.  There are...well, read the book.  Even if you aren't drinking while you read it, you'll feel drunk by the time you finish.<br />If ever there was a book that could be labeled, `Drink me!', \\"Stardust\\" is that book.Stardust\\" is that book.	2003-06-01

But the good ones I've seen so seldom are clean, and the clean ones so seldom are comical (to slightly paraphrase John Letts, the compiler of this Treasury).<br />The literate, English-speaking world seems to be divided into two groups:  those who love limericks; and those who are usually revolted by them.  The compiler attempts to assign men to the former category and women to the latter, but I believe his sexism is a bit out-of-date.  At any rate, I certainly enjoyed his 'Little Treasury.'<br />Letts splits his collection of limericks into nine categories:  'A Garden of Dirty Delights;' 'The Horrible Double Ontong;'  'A Sort of Zoo;' 'A Question of Degree;' 'A Convocation of Curates;' 'Various Ladies (and Gentlemen);' 'Miss Weymiss and the Murderous Sioux;' 'A Gazetteer of Innocence and Infamy;' and 'All Human Life is There.'<br />There are some real classics in this treasury, most of them bawdy.  I am going to paraphrase my favorite for you:<br />There was a young man of Alsace/ who had two anatomical features fashioned of brass./ When he knocked them together/ They played 'Stormy Weather'/ and lightning came out of another portion of his anatomy.<br />If you can figure out the above, you might find yourself like the compiler did the first time he heard about the young Alsatian--falling about on the sidewalk and laughing helplessly.  If not, this collection is probably not for you.	2003-05-31

I put it down several times and had trouble picking it up again.<br />The author had the perfect background for this story:  she and Ted Bundy worked together as volunteers at the Seattle Crisis clinic in 1971; she was already a crime writer, and an ex-cop to boot; she was assigned to work on the case of the mysterious North-west killings long before Bundy was suspected of committing them.  She also belonged to the same sorority (Chi Omega) where Bundy went on his next-to-the-last killing spree in Florida--the case that finally put him on death row.<br />\\"Stranger Beside Me\\" has almost everything you might want to know about Theodore Bundy:  his childhood; the shame he felt because he was illegitimate; his two escapes from prison; the murders he committed and those that he probably committed; the police who were involved in his case; the women who loved him; his court appearances; his confession; his death.<br />However, the book also has a lot you might not want to know about the author:  her bad dreams; her \\"extrasensory awareness of evil or danger\\" in various places connected with Bundy's murders; her feelings about his feelings; her on-again off-again loyalty to Bundy.  There's a great deal of print taken up about how he was really tearing her up inside with all of his alleged wrong-doings, but  I couldn't help wondering if the money she sent to him in prison played a role in his escape to Florida.  I also couldn't help wondering if she stuck with him as long as she did (this is probably totally unfair) because of this book contract.<br />Ann Rule does have a unique insight into the soul (if he had one) of a killer.  This is definitely a one-of-a-kind true crime story.  It's just that I feel it could have been tightened up and cut from 548 pages (the updated twentieth anniversary edition) down to around 350, or so by eliminating the author's personal psycho-dramas.dated twentieth anniversary edition) down to around 350, or so by eliminating the author's personal psycho-dramas.	2003-05-28

Clio is a closed planet, which means that space-farers like Roane must leave the human inhabitants strictly alone to evolve their own destiny.<br />Roane soon breaks the non-interference rule when she is caught in a savage storm and seeks shelter in an abandoned stone tower in the forest.  Unfortunately, some of the local inhabitants also stumble into the tower.  There are several armed men plus a bound, ill-treated woman, and Roane's pity overrules her archeological training.  She frees the woman, who turns out to be the local princess (Clio is a medieval world of warring kingdoms) and they escape from the tower together, Roane pretending to be a Clioite.<br />The off-worlder is soon unmasked by the astute Princess Ludorica, and Roane reluctantly agrees to help the Clioite search for her lost Ice Crown--a gift from the ancient &quot;Guardians&quot; to the royal line, and the source of their power to rule.<br />&quot;Ice Crown&quot; is not a typical Norton 'Forerunner' story, in that the mysterious installation on Clio turns out to have been set up by the long-discredited human Psychocrats, motivated to perform a nasty, planet-wide, multi-generation experiment in mind-control and fixed destiny.  The plot gets a bit jumbled up in Clio's dynastic feuds, but the characters are pure Norton:  the cold technocrats from an advanced civilization versus primitives with a touch of magic in their makeup.  Roane is a typical Norton heroine in that she is made to feel inferior by her more educated/experienced companions, and she acts according to her conscience rather than a set of rigidly defined rules.  In short, she is a very likeable person who is caught up in a conflict not of her own making, but one where she is determined to do the right thing.<br />Vintage Norton with just a slightly confusing plot.	2003-05-24

Cornell has split his catalogue of horrible happenings into two sections: \\"Natural Disasters,\\" and \\"Manmade Disasters.\\"  My copy of  \\"The Great International Disaster Book\\" was published in 1979, so events such as the Union Carbide poisoning of Bhopal, India (12/84), the Kobe, Japan earthquake (01/95), or the cataclysmic 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, Philippines are not included.  However, there are more than enough calamities to horrify and fascinate disaster buffs.<br />Although Mount Pinatubo, the second-largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century may not be included in this book, the largest is (the 1912 eruption of Mt. Katmai in Alaska).  Cornell's list of the ten worst volcanic eruptions runs as follows:<br />1. Krakatoa, Indonesia (1883),<br />2. Mount Pelee, Martinique, West Indies (1902),<br />3. Mount Vesuvius, Italy (A.D. 79),<br />4. Mount Etna, Sicily (1669),<br />5. Tambora, Java (1815),<br />6. Skaptar (Lakagigar), Iceland (1783),<br />7. Mount Kelud, Indonesia (1919),<br />8. Mount Vesuvius, Italy (1631),<br />9. Galunggung, Java (1822),<br />10. Mount Lamington, New Guinea (1951)<br />And the author doesn't just list the ten worst volcanoes, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods, etc.  He writes anywhere from a paragraph to several pages of fascinating detail on each catastrophe.<br />Although the greater part of Cornell's book is devoted to natural disasters, he also spends time on calamities that we've inflicted upon ourselves.  One of the most bizarre is the 20-foot wave of molasses from the Purity Distilling Company explosion that poured through the streets of Boston in 1919, knocking down buildings and drowning 21 people.<br />\\"The Great International Disaster Book\\" is filled with fascinating vignettes such as the above, and the author also supplies an extensive bibliography for those of us who would like to read a more detailed version of a particular disaster.

His grandfather was a skater and iceboater, he and his mother and father were (and are) skiers.  His whole family belonged to the winter.  All the way through this book, wintery thrills overtake fear--the thrill flying four hundred feet down a ski jump; the thrill of stomping a ski into the snow at the top of a slope, then watching the resulting avalanche take out the whole hill; the thrill of hunting narwhal off Greenland's icy shore.<br />The author drives to Greenland in the sense that he arrives in a two-engine Cessna Skymaster after puddle-jumping across the bleak terrain of Baffin Island, dodging through flocks of lesser auks along the way.<br />First though, his essays take us ski jumping in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, sliding for glory down Lake Placid's Olympic luge course, through a run down Aspen's World Cub downhill course, and down Mount Hood. There's a sense that the author only really comes alive during these icy adventures, when all his senses are focused on the moment.<br />Luckily for us, he is able to share that aliveness with his readers. He puts us in touch with something beyond our immediate selves--I'll call it the spirit of the North for lack of a better term.<br />Between adventures, there are long, interesting riffs on different types of ice and snow, a short history of Iceland, and a discussion on building the perfect sea kayak (among other Northerly subjects).<br />Peter Stark is a contributor to &quot;Outside,&quot; &quot;Smithsonian,&quot; and &quot;New Yorker&quot; magazines. His latest book is &quot;Last Breath: Cautionary Tales from the Limits of Human Endurance.&quot;  He is also the editor of an anthology of writing about the Arctic, &quot;Ring of Ice.&quot;  He typifies a rugged new breed of 'hands-on' journalists, and &quot;Driving to Greenland&quot; should appeal to both armchair adventurers and to those few among us who actually long to live in the heart of winter.ers and to those few among us who actually long to live in the heart of winter.	2003-05-17

Slim to none, Id have guessed from previous treatments of my recommendations.<br />In this case though, both husband and friend were hooked from the first page.  The author begins with the tale of Boston Blackie, a cat who went berserk in the presence of other felines.  He ripped off their ears, he gouged out their eyes, he sent them streaking for the bushes even at feeding time.  And then, one daybut I dont want to spoil Blackies story for you.  Just a hint  his name was changed to Basil and no anatomical alterations were involved.<br />Barbara Holland has written an extremely personal book about the history, lore, and personality of Felis libyca.  In the chapter, A Choice of Cats she does riffs on many of the different feline breeds, but it is easy to see that the Siamese is her favorite:<br />Properly treated, Siamese develop a deep, single-hearted devotion to their people and overreact to competition, absences, and infidelity like an adolescent in love.\\"<br />Our own preference is for Maine Coons (we share the house with six), and Barbara Holland tells a great story about them, too.  Not that I agreed with everything she wrote.  For instance, she stated that gray cats as a class are much friendlier than tabbies, which is exactly the opposite of our experience---and weve lived with two grays and about a million tabbies over the years.<br />Holland is also very upset by some of the artificially propagated breeds, such as the Cornish Rex and the Scottish Fold.  Her chapter on Show Business is sad, hilarious, and razor-sharp---sometimes all three in the same sentence.  Even if you think she is way off-base on her assessment of say, Himalayans or feline intelligence or declawing procedures, youll want to keep reading until the end of the book.  She is opinionated even to the point of irritation, but she is also extremely readable.<br />And Holland never confuses cat with cute.<br />There is one chapter in The Name of the Cat that you might want to skip:  not because it is badly written, but because it is totally horrifying.  That chapter is called, Cats and the Church and it relates the history of cats in (primarily) medieval Europe.nt to keep reading until the end of the book.

Gabriel Du Pr&eacute; is laconic, honorable, and wise to the ways of the Big Sky Country---a throwback to the noble cowboy-hero of Zane Grey's novels.  He is a vulnerable hero, a M&eacute;tis descendant of the French Voyageurs and Plains Indians.  He has problems with his teenage daughter, who has shaved off part of her hair and dyed the rest of it a weird color.  His mistress won't marry him because in the eyes of the Church, she is still married to the sleaze who deserted her many years past.  He is plagued throughout the book by an alcoholic M&eacute;tis prophet.<br />Du Pr&eacute;'s voice is unique, and perfect for this story.  His dialogue is short, punchy, flicked with mordant barbs---an arrow in your eye when you are least expecting it.  Two chapters into the book, found myself talking, thinking like Du Pr&eacute;.<br />The mystery of who killed whom in \\"Coyote Wind\\" is fairly easy to unravel once you get to know and care about the characters.  It almost had to occur, considering the people involved.  It becomes more important to see if Du Pr&eacute; can help a friend stop drinking, rather than to figure out who murdered his friend's brother.  As Du Pr&eacute; keeps telling everyone who will listen:  \\"I ain't a cop...I am a [brand inspector].\\"<br />Nevertheless, it is Du Pr&eacute; who is tapped to solve a thirty-year-old murder.  He goes about it in a style that is perfectly tuned to his character.  Not a single false note from Du Pr&eacute; or his fiddle.<br />\\"Coyote Wind\\" is a very satisfying read.	2003-05-11

The pen is placed at any point on the rolling circle. If the radius of fixed circle is R, the radius of moving circle is r, and the offset of the pen point in the moving circle is O, then the equation of the resulting curve is defined by:<br />x = (R+r)*cos(t) - (r+O)*cos(((R+r)/r)*t)<br />y = (R+r)*sin(t) - (r+O)*sin(((R+r)/r)*t)<br />For examples of spirographs and how they are affected by R, r, and O check out the website: wordsmith.org/~anu/java/spirograph.html.  Using the Java applet at the site, you can vary your spirographs by changing R, r, and O.<br />\\"The Spiral Draw Book\\" is accompanied by a fixed circle template called a 'frame,' and four moving circle templates called 'wheels' that have many offset points (holes within the wheel), so you can draw many different sizes of spirographs.  The frame and the wheels are made of sturdy, translucent plastic in shades of blue, green, purple, and yellow.  Three stubby gel pens are also included that supposedly change color as you draw.<br />The book itself is spiral-bound with heavy-duty glossy pages on which the artist is encourage to complete printed drawings with spirographs.  For instance, there's a flower pot with stems and leaves that can be finished by drawing spirograph flowers.<br />Directions for use are clear and well-illustrated.  The only tricky part (for me) was applying enough pressure to the frame so that it stayed in one place, but not so much pressure that the wheel stopped moving.<br />This book also contains intstructions for making stationery, jewelry, bead curtains, and soak art.	2003-05-07

The Earth ends in fire, then ice as a consequence of our sun's evolution.<br />According to \\"Frontiers of Time,\\" humanity might find a temporary home on Mars while the sun is in its red-giant phase.  Ultimately we could inhabit the Oort Cloud which has a surface area equivalent to 100 million planets the size of Earth, if Carl Sagan and Freeman Dyson turn out to be true prophets.  In the frozen domain of the comets, the sun would shine only a little more brightly than the other stars.<br />The authors spend a few pages discussing dangers we face while still on Earth.  Comet and meteor strikes are included of course, although this book is just a bit too old to talk about the Chicxulub impact crater, which appears to be exactly the right age and the right size to have terminated most of the life on Earth, sixty-five million years ago.  However, mention is made of the iridium layer and the fact that a comet or meteor impact must have caused the extinctions at the K-T boundary.<br />Some play is also given to the Milankovitch  theory of climate change, and the likelihood of another ice age some time soon.<br />NOTE: good news from the NASA website--no Northern Hemisphere summer insolation declines sufficient to cause an ice age are expected for the next 100,000 years.<br />What will happen five billion years from now when our sun exhausts its central store of hydrogen?  The authors believe that life on Earth will have long since vanished as the greenhouse effect turns our planet into another stifling, waterless Venus.  The sun itself will dwindle down to a long life as a white dwarf, then ultimately cool down to a small, long-forgotten cinder.<br />Now we've arrived at the heart of \\"Frontiers of Time\\"--the grand finale of our universe as all the stars go out and the galaxies themselves evaporate, leaving behind little more than massive black holes.  Not only that--\\"a trillion trillion years from now, gravitational radiation will have brought all orbital motion in the universe to a halt.\\"<br /><br />The authors consider three alternative fates for the universe: open and expanding like crazy; open, but slowing down; and closed (be sure to check out the 'Americans for a Closed Universe' web site.  It's a hoot).  Current observations say that there is not enough matter in the universe to reverse the expansion and head us towards a 'Big Crunch.' There certainly isn't enough visible matter, but there is evidence of matter that we can't see, i.e. the so-called 'dark matter.'<br />This book shows its age (date of publication: 1991) in its discussion of dark matter, and in the absence of any discussion of 'dark energy'(which seems to be pushing galaxies apart even faster into the farthest reaches of the universe.)<br />It now appears as though 'Open Universe' wins, all protons in the universe will cease to exist, and we'll be left in a very cold, very dull vacuum of elementary particles.<br />Go to the Internet for the very latest on cosmological theories of proton death, '11-dimensional M-theory,' 'weakly-coupled heterotic strings', and the recently proposed 'ekpyrotic scenario.'  Meanwhile, read this book for a sound overview on the End of Everything.  As always with the Time-Life books, it is filled with beautiful full-color diagrams and photographs.

There certainly isn't enough visible matter, but there is evidence of matter that we can't see, i.e. the so-called 'dark matter.'<br />This book shows its age (date of publication: 1991) in its discussion of dark matter, and in the absence of any discussion of 'dark energy'(which seems to be pushing galaxies apart even faster into the farthest reaches of the universe.)<br />It now appears as though 'Open Universe' wins, all protons in the universe will cease to exist, and we'll be left in a very cold, very dull vacuum of elementary particles.<br />Go to the Internet for the very latest on cosmological theories of proton death, '11-dimensional M-theory,' 'weakly-coupled heterotic strings', and the recently proposed 'ekpyrotic scenario.'   Meanwhile, read this book for a sound overview on the End of Everything.  As always with the Time-Life books, it is filled with beautiful full-color diagrams and photographs.  And as always, the names of the scientists who were consulted for this book are buried on its last page in very small type.	2003-05-01

I can't imagine Dr. Zinsser's grumpily discursive, masterfully written, and ultimately profound biography of typhus fever ever going completely out of print.<br />Stylistically the only work I can compare it to is Gibbon's \\"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\\". Where Gibbon occasionally dipped his pen in vinegar and excoriated the Christians, Zinsser dips his pen in hydrochloric acid and savages all of the quaint human customs that have kept Typhus alive and thriving. He shows much more affectionate sympathy for the louse than he does for the General or the Politician.<br /><br />In the interests of research, Zinsser carried pill boxes of lice under his socks for weeks at a time before taking \\"advantage of them for scientific purposes.\\"  He is not able to tear himself away from these little creatures and address the true subject of his biography, i.e. the typhus germ, until Chapter 12!<br /><br />However, the journey to Chapter 12 is well worth taking because along the way, Zinsser wittily savages modern biographers, psychoanalysis, astronomers and physicists who \\"scamper back to God\\" (Biologists evidently are much less prone to being 'born again'), and of course, all of the wars that have given Typhus countless opportunities to murder lice and humans alike.<br /><br />\\"Rats, Lice, and History\\" should be required reading for would-be writers for its style, would-be Generals for its lessons on how soldiers really die, and for anyone else who is interested in a passionate, eminently witty, one-of-a-kind history of medicine.	2003-04-25

Henri Bencolin, 'juge d'instruction' of the Seine, the head of the Paris police and \\"the most dangerous man in Europe.\\"  His eyelid droops lazily.  His \\"cloven hoof peeps out suavely.\\"  He has \\"narrow, cruel\\" eyes.  When he was hot on the scent of a criminal, he was \\"outwardly cool, but his nostrils were dilated, and in him smouldered a subdued, terrible joy.\\"<br />John Dickson Carr descends from 'atmospheric' to 'lurid' in his Bencolin mysteries.  The bad women chain-smoke.  Their eyes \\"smoulder deeply.\\"  They wear blood-red lipstick.  They cross their long, silk-clad legs and let their negligees fall open.  They frequent jazz nightclubs and say things like, \\"Ce chameau, ce sal fils de putain!\\" when speaking of Bencolin.<br /><br />The bad guys are also easy to identify.  Their eyes \\"glare spongily.\\"  Their faces \\"screw up ferociously, resembling malevolent gnomes.\\"  If one of them leers, \\"...the drunken leer... metamorphosed into a thing chuckling and leprous.\\"  If one of them laughs, \\"the echo of evil jollity coiled around [the] silent room.\\"<br />If you relish a brooding, almost supernatural horror mixing it up with your detective story, and if you are immune to the snotty racism of a 1930s Anglo-French upperclass, you'll love Carr's Bencolin mysteries.  I certainly do.<br />\\"The Lost Gallows\\" begins when the rich Egyptian El Moulk's limousine plunges out of a London fog and crashes to a halt in front of London's notorious Brimstone club.  Its driver has been dead for a long time, his throat slit from ear-to-ear.  El Moulk himself has vanished from the limousine.<br />The Brimstone's cavernous rooms and gaslit passages provide an eerie backdrop for a murderer who threatens to hang his victims on a gallows located on the mysterious 'Ruination Street,' which is not on any modern London map.  Ever since he took rooms at the Brimstone Club, El Moulk has been terrified by a series of 'gifts' from the man who calls himself 'Jack Ketch'--the name applied in general to all English hangmen. These gifts included a miniature gibbet, a length of rope, and an ancient Egyptian curse.<br /><br />Now El Moulk has gone missing out of a limousine driven by a dead man.  Will Bencolin and his friends from New Scotland Yard locate the lost Ruination Street in time to prevent another murder?<br />I wish my copy of \\"The Lost Gallows\\" hadn't fallen apart, because I know I'll want to read it again.

In the 20th century it is Richard Stone Reeves (RSR), an American &quot; - The New York Times.<br />Take a look at the prices for RSR's signed prints on one of the online auctions--Sports artist Leroy Neiman doesn't even come close!  You could get a Secretariat bobble-head doll for less than half of what you would pay for an RSR print of the same horse.<br />As befits royalty, most of the oil paintings in this book show the Thoroughbred classically posed, head up, one leg slightly in advance of the other.  Swaps is walking away from the viewer, and Damascus and Forego are in full flight in their respective paintings, but most of the subjects stand regally still--either because RSR doesn't like to work from photographs, or because that's what the owner commissioned.<br />Aside from some commentary on each painting and its subject by RSR, renowned 'Derbyologist' Jim Bolus (who unfortunately died of a heart attack in 1997) provides most of the text about the Thoroughbreds whose portraits are included in this book.  They range from the incomparable Man o'War, Citation, Secretariat, and Ruffian (to mention a few) through the not-quite-so-famous Hansel, Fly So Free, and Tabasco Cat, who are still standing at stud.  A few English and European Thoroughbreds are also added to the mix.  Bolus narrates the history and some interesting anecdotes about each of these fifty beautiful race horses.  There are also black-and-white photographs of each horse, a three-generation pedigree, and (more occasionally) a line drawing.<br />&quot;Royal Blood&quot; comes in a slip-case and Irish linen cover and would make a beautiful gift for your resident horse-lover (that's how I got mine).  Hurry though--the price is bound to go up as it has for all of RSR's books.	2003-04-22

It contains over 353 illustrations with 135 in color, so readers are introduced to sections of the opera house and performances that they otherwise might not have seen even if they were life-long residents of Milan.<br />Naturally the photos include many of the great singers who appeared at La Scala, such as Nicolai Gedda, Jos&eacute; Van Dam, Mirella Freni, Theresa Berganza, Montserrat Caball&eacute;, Placido Domingo, and Ruggiero Raimondi.<br />Renata Tebaldi also appears, but there is little mention (and no photographs) of her famous rival, Maria Callas.  Evidently the authors of this book took sides in the 'great soprano war' because Callas and La Scala were inseparable in the 1950s.  She opened the 1951 season at La Scala in &quot;I Vespri Siciliani&quot; and over the next seven years this opera house witnessed some of her greatest triumphs in a wide range of roles.  I would have thought it impossible to write a book about the &quot;Teatro alla Scala&quot; without mention of this fascinating woman.  But when opera fanatics take sides...<br />And really, there isn't much text in this book.  It was produced in commemoration of the two hundredth anniversary of La Scala, but is not so much a history of the opera house as it is a photographic celebration of productions during the 1970s.  Ballet is not neglected, but most of the photographs are of operas, their singers and musicians, the back-stage workers who support them, the directors who produce them, and the audiences who attend them.  One of the most gorgeous photographs in this book is of La Scala's stage surrounded by golden tiers of boxes, and seemingly reflected upside down in the waters of an imaginary lake.<br />If you are in love with the 'Queen of Music' you should have this book, no matter which side of the 'Great Soprano War' you espouse.	2003-04-22

Bronx-born and Brooklyn-bred, Dr. Baden doesn't shy away from a fight whether it was with the Mayor of New York City who fired him (Dr. Baden eventually sued Mayor Koch for wrongful dismissal and won his case) or the Warren Commission, which was charged with the investigation of President Kennedy's assassination.<br /><br />Baden refers to himself as \\"a witness to the dead,\\" and treats the bodies on his autopsy table with what can only be described as reverence.  Forensic Pathology is both a fascinating profession and a sacred calling for him.  During his forty-year career he has conducted more than 20,000 autopsies and has served as an expert witness on homicide cases that include Nicole Brown Simpson, the last alleged victim of Albert DeSalvo, \\"Sunny\\" von Bulow (included in this book), John Belushi (also in this book),  and JonBenet Ramsey.<br /><br />Also there are those wonderful political brawls, the foremost of which in \\"Unnatural Death\\" is Dr. Baden's tussle with various government officials involved in the investigation of the deaths during the Attica prison riot.  In a way, I wish there was less politics and more science in this autobiography, but Dr. Baden correctly points out that reforming the 'politics of death' and raising the status of MEs is one of his most important goals.<br />This book also highlights cases and anecdotes where the emphasis is on detection and forensic science rather than politics.  One of the most gruesome involved a New York City ME who kept a tray of feet that had been cut off at the ankles.  He called it the 'Centipede' and used his display to convince the Federal Aviation Agency that airplane seats needed to be redesigned.  People's feet were being cut off during airplane crashes by the bar under their seat that was supposed to keep suitcases from sliding backwards.<br />The seats were redesigned, thanks in part to the 'Centipede.'<br />One of the saddest, most inexplicable (in psychological terms, at least) cases in \\"Unnatural Death\\" is Dr. Baden's investigation of the deaths of Mary Beth and Joseph Tinning's nine children in upstate New York.  One aspect of this case that is not widely known is Mary Beth's attempted poisoning of her husband (she was having an affair with a minister at the time).  According to Dr. Baden, Joseph Tinning \\"did not feel that his marriage had been destroyed by this attempt to annihilate him.\\"  Nor, evidently by the deaths of his nine children.<br />Readers will definitely gain an appreciation of the value of forensic pathology from this book, which I believe was Dr. Baden's ultimate goal in writing it.seats were redesigned, thanks in part to the 'Centipede.'<br />One of the saddest, most inexplicable (in psychological terms, at least) cases in \\"Unnatural Death\\" is Dr. Baden's investigation of the deaths of Mary Beth and Joseph Tinning's nine children in upstate New York.

In nearly 1400 pages this quartet of books takes the reader off the beaten paths and onto a grand tour of the natural history of this country. The only other books I know of that are remotely similar to these are John McPhee's geological grand tour of the 40th Parallel, &quot;Annals of the Former World&quot; (formerly published as a four-volume set).<br />If Annie Dillard had abandoned Tinker's Creek and taken a pilgrimage across America, she might have written books comparable to Teale's opus magnus.<br />The author and his wife, Nellie are the grandparents everyone should have, pottering about the country, writing reams of lucid prose about their adventures.  Teale's warmth and breadth of interests sustain our attention through the migration of a pod of gray whales, the discovery of hibernating poorwills in the lower Colorado desert, giant beavers on the Missouri, or a night in the 'sugarbushes' of New Hampshire.  The pace might seem a bit stately to some readers, but Nature is stately.  This is a trait that ought to belong to naturalists. It is the antithesis of the TV generation's notoriously short attention span.<br />Here then are the subjects in one chapter of the Teales' leisurely journey, &quot;The Diamond Farm:&quot;  'Plowing for diamonds'--'Two shining pebbles'--'A crop of precious stones'--'The volcanic matrix'--'Kimberlite rock'--'A quiet interlude'--'Diamond in the mud'--'The elegant searcher'--'Doodlebugs'--'A rare example of credulity'--'A turtle-carrying spaniel'--'Law of the White Queen'--'Sorghum molasses'--'Edge of the Ozarks'--'&quot;Ridge runners&quot;'--'Contracted names'--'The brown, historic river.'<br />Teale's black-and-white photographs form a meticulous record of their journey through an American winter, including one of Nellie in her hat, long coat, and stout walking-shoes amid wind-formed gypsum dunes.  It is easy to fall in love with these books, and the couple who lived each chapter.aphs form a meticulous record of their journey through an American winter, including one of Nellie in her hat, long coat, and stout walking-shoes amid wind-formed gypsum dunes.

Hudler is Professor of Plant Pathology at Cornell University where he offers a popular course that has the same name as this book.  He also edits \\"Branching Out,\\" a biweekly newsletter for tree care professionals in the northeastern United States.  In fact some of the bleakest chapters in \\"Magical Mushrooms, Mischievous Molds\\" concern the majestic species of trees that used to shade the American landscape.  \\"Under the spreading chestnut tree\\" is no more--done in by the fungus 'Cryphonectria parasitica.'  Professor Hudler also includes a deservedly little-known poem by Robert Frost, \\"Evil Tendencies Cancel\\" whose subject is the chestnut blight.<br />Dutch Elm disease, whose most common conida (spores) resemble jelly beans on tiny black toothpicks has blighted our landscapes since World War I when it was first discovered in Holland.  This fungus can actually be controlled as long as communities are willing to sustain a commitment--unfortunately the city where I live ran out of money and/or enthusiasm for preserving these lovely old trees, and I've been watching them die off one by one ever since we moved here twenty years ago.<br />Grim anecdotes aside, this book is a lively mixture of scientific fact and an overview of how fungi have changed our lives.  For instance, most of us were taught that Dr. Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin at St. Mary's Hospital in London in 1928.  But Professor Hudler also relates that Joseph Lister, the father of antiseptic surgery used a penicillium mold extract to heal a young girl in Edinburgh in 1844.  And three thousand years ago, the Chinese were using moldy soybean curd to cure skin infections.<br />After explaining \\"What Fungi Do and How They Do it\\" in Chapter two, the author devotes several chapters to \\"Fungi as Pathogens of Food Crops.\\"  The fungus that turned Irish potato crops into a \\"putrid black mush\\" in the mid-eighteen-hundreds is 'Phytophthora infestans (once known as 'Botrytis infestans).'  Potato blight also destroyed German food crops in 1915 and 1916, and over 700,000 Germans starved--possibly assuring the Allied victory over the Kaiser's troops in 1918.<br />'P. Infestans' also wreaks havoc in backyard tomato plantings in the northeastern United States (I can personally attest to this).  Copper-based fungicide will control this fungus--in fact the Germans knew this during World War I, but their copper stocks were reserved for shell casings.<br />Even more interesting is the chapter on \\"Ergot of Grain Crops\\" and ergotamine poisoning, which may have been responsible for such historical events as the medieval 'plagues of fire,' the witchcraft frenzies, and the Eleusian Mysteries in Classical Greece.  LSD is only one of the alkaloids that can be derived from 'Claviceps purpurea,' the ergot fungus.<br />Aside from deadly mycotoxins, putrid potatoes, and psychedelic mushrooms, the author also discusses fungi responsible for the production of life-saving drugs (not just penicillin), bread, beer, and wine.  He goes into such loving detail over the production of the latter two yeast-based products that I'm led to wonder if he is an amateur vintner or brewer.<br />Incidentally, I learned that it's not the beer that will kill frequent tavern-goers--it's the mold on the free peanuts, which manufactures a potent carcinogen!<br />Another very interesting book for budding (sorry) mycologists is \\"In the Company of Mushrooms: a Biologist's Tale\\" by Elio Schaechter.he author devotes several chapters to \\"Fungi as Pathogens of Food Crops.\\"  The fungus that turned Irish potato crops into a \\"putrid black mush\\" in the mid-eighteen-hundreds is 'Phytophthora infestans (once known as 'Botrytis infestans).'

All of the characters act suspiciously, including the true and false heir to the extensive Farnleigh estate (and the title that goes with it), their two lawyers, the butler, Lady Farnleigh, and assorted family friends.  The reader has many reasons to suspect each character in turn after the murder (or was it suicide?) of one of the two competing heirs.  The only person who might be able to tell whether the true John Farnleigh died or still lives is his tutor, Murray who happens to have taken a thumb-o-graph of young John before he was sent away to America to live with a distant relative.<br />John wasn't the heir, but the black sheep of the family when he was packed off to Colorado via the spanking, new ocean liner, 'Titanic.'  He was thought to have died when his ship sank on her maiden voyage, but after his older brother dies without issue, not one but two John Farnleighs show up within a year of each other to claim the family estate and title.  The first one to appear marries John's childhood sweetheart and settles down to manage Farnleigh.<br />Then up pops John Farnleigh #2, one of the competing heirs dies, and someone steals Murray's thumb-o-graph.  The reader is beset with conflicting stories and clues, when Dr. Fell finally lumbers onto the scene with his shovel-hat, swirling cape, and crutch-headed cane.  He figures out who killed whom right away, but the reader is left grasping at hints (some of them pretty darn subtle - I think Carr cheats a little on this mystery) until the final denouement, which involves that fateful night when the 'Titanic' went down.<br />As always with this author, the eerie, suffocating atmosphere surrounding a mysterious death is tinged with an aura of the supernatural.  \\"The Crooked Hinge\\" features devil worship and a horrible old eighteenth-century automaton called, 'The Golden Hag.'  Her sinister appearances alone make this a novel worth savoring, and Carr also provides a meticulously plotted mystery (although I could do without a few of his great detective's tics and his refusal to blab out the name of the murderer as soon as he figures out whodunit.

The scene of the crime is a plush love nest on the outskirts of Paris where Rose Klonec had her midnight rendezvous with Death.  Not one but four different murder weapons are found in the room with her corpse.  The table is set for a feast.  Champagne abounds.<br />Bencolin must determine which one of her lovers or ex-lovers hated her enough to murder her---or was it a stranger, uninvited to the feast?<br />John Dickson Carr assembles a dashing, dissolute group of suspects that includes a reformed playboy, a high-stakes gambler, and a beautiful, young woman whose father was hanged for murder.  His Bencolin mysteries always include the following:<br />* A beautiful, neurasthenic young woman who at some point in the plot becomes the main suspect, and/or becomes convinced that she committed murder.<br />* A square-jawed Englishman who falls in love with the beautiful, but somewhat hysterical young woman.  The Englishman also serves as Bencolin's foil and eagerly pursues all of the plot's red herrings.<br />* A very complex mystery that usually involves a `locked room,' false murder weapons, complicated time-tables, and air-tight alibis (at least for the villains).<br />* A decadent, hot-house atmosphere, sometimes with a suggestion of the supernatural.  Unspeakable horror always lurks just down the dark, crimson-carpeted hall. All of the characters end up hyper-ventilating, not just the beautiful, young heroine.<br />I read the John Dickson Carr mysteries for their atmosphere.  There is no other author who has such a wonderful sense of the lurid.  In \\"The Four False Weapons,\\" he takes us to a 1920s Parisian gambling club where only the very rich are invited to play.

In this book, a man is strangled to death on a sand tennis court.  Only one set of footprints leads across the court--and they belong to the corpse.<br />Okay, whodunit?  As usual in a 'Golden Age' mystery, there are lots of suspects and motives.  The corpse was a particularly venomous sort of ladies man who never did an honest day's work.  Everyone disliked him except for his adopted father, and that included his two discarded mistresses, his fianc&eacute;e and the guy who keeps proposing marriage to her, and an acrobat.<br />Some of my favorite theories as presented by the various characters involved ice skates, sneaking up behind the victim by walking on one's hands, and making one's way to the middle of the court by creeping across the wire netting.<br />Then a second victim is murdered (taking out my favorite suspect), and Carr's gigantic Dr. Gideon Fell must clear up all of the false theories and discover the real murderer.<br />Carr plays fair with his readers. All of the clues needed to solve this mystery are presented, including (in my Bantam edition, at least) a diagram of the tennis court.  The author demolishes the false theories with ponderous ease, including a hilarious passage where two well-meaning clue-hunters wreck several tennis courts by trying to prove that the murderer could have crept along the overhead netting.  The solution involves a fairly complex set-up, but revolves around the particular relationship that the victim had with his murderer, so I don't think Carr was blind-siding his readers.<br />Although this author was an American most of his mysteries (including this one) are set in England.

Otherwise we might have to go to war with all of those countries that he reported to be shaped like a large ketchup stain, or where he had to shell out 4,000 pfarthings to use the public restroom.  Our author does not take such insults lightly.  Nor does he expect you to.  This guide is filled with such useful phrases as, &quot;Mi (esposo, esposa) es been tramplado por toros,&quot; or &quot;Tuo fratello Raoul dormi con los pesces.&quot;<br />Luckily, according to Dave, many foreign people speak our language.  &quot;Stick them up!&quot; they'll say.  &quot;Please to be handing over your American Express traveler's checks!  Don't leave home without them!&quot;<br />There are lots of useful airline tips in this book, such as how to behave if your airplane is infested by demons, how to fit a lawn tractor into the overhead baggage compartment, and what do about the 475-pound man in the adjacent seat who has forearms the size of Roseanne.  For those of you who are afraid of flying, the author very kindly takes time to explain how an airplane flies (I didn't know an airplane wing had ailerons AND halyards).<br />Dave doesn't just do Europe.  He also takes on the fifty states ('Massachusetts is an Indian word meaning &quot;place that is hard to spell&quot;), Canada (which &quot;boasts numerous goose-infested lakes&quot;), and Mexico (&quot;Unit of Currency - The Lambada&quot;).  I can't help wondering whether this book had anything to do with the current state of relations between ourselves and our closest neighbors.<br />Don't let your kids read this book right before a history or geography test, especially not Dave's highlighted &quot;Facts at a Glance&quot; boxes.  Even I know that the unit of currency in Greece is not 'The Sheep.&quot;  It's the 'minimum.'	2003-03-23

Much of the action centers around Mr. Patrick Butler, K.C., an Irish barrister also known as 'The Great Defender.\\"  He has made his reputation by defending notorious women in Old Bailey and always getting them off.  He doesn't care whether his clients are guilty or innocent.  In fact, he prefers the guilty ones as they are more of a challenge.<br />Butler was a man I loved to hate, at least in the beginning.  He offers up the opinion that the way women can be kept happy in prison is by giving them a mirror, a comb, and some make-up.  He tells several of the other characters that he is never wrong.  He shouts at one judge, \\"How do you like that, you old swine?\\"<br />Actually, that was when I began to feel a certain fondness toward Butler.  The judge really was an old swine.  Butler blithely blunders about grim, post-war London finally getting his comeuppance from a pair of unlikely characters:  a newly widowed ditzy blonde who is accused of poisoning her husband; and a small-time hood whose nickname is 'Gold-teeth.'<br />Carr certainly works hard at building up a sinister atmosphere around a mysterious cult that worships Satan and poisons people for fun and profit.  However, some of his gimmicks may seem quaint and rather tame to the modern reader:  the women who worship Satan wear red garters!  Marijuana-scented candles are used during the hideous ceremony of the Black Mass!  Innocent young maids are lured into serving as the altar during said hideous ceremony!  (Afterwards they are given two free passes to a future mass, and a tastefully matched set of black candles--many clues revolve around Dr. Fell scrapping black wax off of the most innocent-appearing householder's candelabras).<br />The gangsters aren't really part of the plot, but serve as props upon which our hero, Butler bloodies his knuckles a few times.  One of my favorite scenes involves a ruckus where he heaves billiard balls at various menacing figures armed with brass knuckles and razor-studded potatoes.<br />The denouement, when Butler unmasks the evil cult leader might elicit guffaws rather than gasps of astonishment, but if you have a surreptitious fondness for lurid mid-twentieth-century detective novels, I think you'll enjoy \\"Below Suspicion.\\"few times.

Here is a young man who has lived the primitive life you extolled-- and writes about it like a dream.  We Westerners are guilty of dismissing and destroying cultures we consider uncivilized, but the so-called primitive life also fascinates us.  We see in it an unforced spirituality, and a deeper sense of communion with both nature and tribe--all the values we left behind in our race for more and bigger agriculture.<br />Our ambivalence toward these emotions--what Marianna Torgovnick, professor and chair of the English department at Duke University, and author of \\"Primitive Passions\\" has called the \\"the sensation of merging with the universe\\"--is at the root of our fascination with the primitive.  As D. H. Lawrence expressed it: \\"the human race is . . . like a great uprooted tree, with its roots in the air. We must plant ourselves again in the universe.\\"<br />This is what James Stephenson does.  At age twenty-seven, this artist and landscape-builder wandered off into the African bush with little more than his paints and a pocketful of plastic snakes and spiders that his mother gave him (for practical jokes and to fend off beggars).  He had visited the Hadzabe several times before, and intended to spend a year eating, drinking, hunting, and dreaming with them.<br />He writes about the Hadzabe as though he had lived in a state of total realization with them.  Somehow he managed to short-circuit all of the fears that would have kept me from abandoning the safety and comfort of civilization.  But he also admits to the danger of becoming a free, primal man:  \\"The mental discipline that makes one restrain his/her action in the present...was no longer functioning properly...\\"  'Future' was only a concept.  He was no longer concerned about AIDS and sought multiple women for sexual pleasure.  He went on drinking binges with his companions.  He slept on the ground, endured mudslides, stinging insects, parasites, bad water and baby starlings for breakfast. Creatively, he was on fire.<br />There is a hallucinatory quality in the images that this author employs, especially on his hunting trips with the Hadzabe men.  He was also taken on two, longer journeys of the spirit to search for the mountain of Nudulungu (the Hadzabe Christ figure) and to pay homage to the rock paintings of the Hadzabe ancestors.  These two journeys are the heart of this book, and also the heart of the Hadzabe, one of Africa's vanishing tribes who still live off of the land and the forest without the benefit (and curse) of agriculture.<br />There are probably more elephants in Africa today than there are hunter-gatherers.<br />One of the ironies of this book is that it is the Hadzabe who feed their farmer-neighbors in times of drought and famine and not the other way around.<br />The author rarely resorts to anger or irony, but \\"The Language of the Land\\" is an elegy.  His Hadzabe companions are brought to vivid life within the pages of this book, but even they know that they're probably the last of the men who will live in balance with the other life of the great African forests and savannahs.for breakfast.

As may be guessed from the murder site, Carr relies heavily on atmospherics: shrouds of fog; a corpse with a crossbow bolt through its heart; an unpublished story by Edgar Allen Poe; and above all a mad prankster who steals the headgear of London's elite (everyone wore hats in 1933) and displays his prizes in the most unlikely locations.<br />When a corpse shows up near Traitor's Gate with a stolen top hat jammed on its head, Scotland Yard automatically enlists Dr. Gideon Fell to solve the bizarre murder.<br /><br />He solves it of course--but not before an army of suspects each takes his or her turn in the spotlight.  Although Carr is most famously known for his locked -room mysteries and 'impossible' crimes, he was also a master of the eerie atmosphere. \\"The Mad Hatter Mystery\\" has both in great quantity: lots of macabre touches; and the solution will surprise even the keenest mystery buff.  Dr. Fell's tics and grotesqueries aren't as intrusive as in some of Carr's other mysteries starring his massive, eccentrically-dressed detective.  The doctor also shows a great deal of restraint (for him) in dropping hints that he already knows the identity of the murderer, even though it's only page forty-five and the reader has two-hundred-and-forty-one pages to go before he or she figures out whodunit.<br /><br />Supposedly modeled after Carr's idol, G.K. Chesterton, Dr. Fell also resembles a jovial Father Christmas or a President Chester A. Arthur, resting comfortably after a vast meal that was consumed with countless pints of beer.  He's not my favorite fictional detective, although he appeared in twenty-three novels culminating in \\"Dark of the Moon\\" (1967).  However, I do like Carr's atmospheric mysteries so I'll probably end up reading all twenty-three of 'em.  This is one of the best, so far.	2003-03-04

He painted the mundane work-a-day life: &quot;Freight Cars Under a Bridge;&quot; &quot;Wires Down,&quot; &quot;Return of the Lake Fishermen,&quot; &quot;Old Tavern at Hammondsville, Ohio.&quot;  But I think he will ultimately be remembered for the nature paintings, that he deeply imbued with his personal symbolism of both vision and sound. Check out his &quot;Song of the Telegraph&quot; or &quot;Autumnal Fantasy&quot; if you'd like to see how he incorporated sound into his paintings--they're both shown in this catalogue (unfortunately there are only seventeen color plates.  The majority of the illustrations are black and white).<br />In 1916-18 Burchfield executed a series of imaginative watercolors originating from childhood memories, and based for the most part on nature, e.g. &quot;Dandelion Seed Balls and Trees,&quot; &quot;Passing Shower in June,&quot; &quot;In the Swamp,&quot; and &quot;Insect Chorus&quot; --another of his wonderful 'sound' paintings.  In 1921 he moved from Ohio to Buffalo, New York where he became interested in the heartland architecture of the 1870s and 1880s.  He began to paint the Mid-Western scene in a more realistic spirit.  This is the period when his output consisted of railroad bridges (&quot;Black Iron&quot; 1935), locomotive repair shops, grain elevators, etc.<br />The latter subject, painted in oils in 1938 seems to have caused an epiphany for Burchfield.  He considered it the most disappointing painting of his career and abandoned the oil medium completely.  By 1943 he completed his return to the more imaginative and romantic vision of his early work.  Some of my favorite watercolors are from this period:  &quot;The Sphinx and the Milky Way&quot; (1946); &quot;Hush Before the Storm&quot; (1947); &quot;Orion in December&quot; (1959); &quot;Dandelion Seed Heads and the Moon&quot; (1961 - 65).<br />This catalogue of Burchfield's paintings (mainly watercolor) segments his work by year, starting with 1911 when he graduated as valedictorian of his high school class, through 1967, when he died of a heart attack on January 10th.  There is an extensive bibliography of Burchfield's publications, and works about him, plus an index of his catalogued works (with a page number if the painting is illustrated in this catalogue).  The author also includes a short biography, photographs, maps, and a brief summary of each year in Burchfield's career, e.g. 1923:  &quot;Birth of first child, Mary Alice.  He became interested in Russian [music]...which seemed in harmony...&quot; with what he was trying to express in his paintings.<br />This catalogue is a must for all serious Burchfield admirers.

All of the characters act suspiciously, including the true and false heir to the extensive Farnleigh estate (and the title that goes with it), their two lawyers, the butler, Lady Farnleigh, and assorted family friends.  The reader has many reasons to suspect each character in turn after the murder (or was it suicide?) of one of the two competing heirs.  The only person who might be able to tell whether the true John Farnleigh died or still lives is his tutor, Murray who happens to have taken a thumb-o-graph of young John before he was sent away to America to live with a distant relative.<br />John wasn't the heir, but the black sheep of the family when he was packed off to Colorado via the spanking, new ocean liner, 'Titanic.'  He was thought to have died when his ship sank on her maiden voyage, but after his older brother dies without issue, not one but two John Farnleighs show up within a year of each other to claim the family estate and title.  The first one to appear marries John's childhood sweetheart and settles down to manage Farnleigh.<br />Then up pops John Farnleigh #2, one of the competing heirs dies, and someone steals Murray's thumb-o-graph.  The reader is beset with conflicting stories and clues, when Dr. Fell finally lumbers onto the scene with his shovel-hat, swirling cape, and crutch-headed cane.  He figures out who killed whom right away, but the reader is left grasping at hints (some of them pretty darn subtle - I think Carr cheats a little on this mystery) until the final denouement, which involves that fateful night when the 'Titanic' went down.<br />As always with this author, the eerie, suffocating atmosphere surrounding a mysterious death is tinged with an aura of the supernatural.  \\"The Crooked Hinge\\" features devil worship and a horrible old eighteenth-century automaton called, 'The Golden Hag.'  Her sinister appearances alone make this a novel worth savoring, and Carr also provides a meticulously plotted mystery (although I could do without a few of his great detective's tics and his refusal to blab out the name of the murderer as soon as he figures out whodunit.

This novel is basically a British comedy of manners, thinly disguised as a whodunit.  It is narrated in the first person by one of the suspects, who happens to be a writer.<br />The aristocratic Arthur and his relatives gather for the Christmas holiday at Belrive Priory, the ancient family seat in the north of England.  Much to their dismay, they learn that the current owner of Belrive, Arthur's cousin Basil, is planning to sell his estate to a brewer.<br />Basil, the seventh Baronet of Belrive Priory, needs the money to fund an expedition to the Arctic.<br />When Basil's nephew Wilfred is shot, every one wonders whether Basil had been the real target---and whether there would be a second, fatal attempt on the seventh Baronet's life.<br />Inspector John Appleby happens to be a guest at dinner on the night of the shooting.  The local constable is only too happy to turn the crime over to the young CID inspector, and so Appleby enters the fray with Arthur serving as his Watson and family historian.<br />Michael Innes (pseudonym for John Innes Mackintosh Stewart) has out-Agatha'd Christie in this early Appleby.  Each character is suspected in turn, and each has a plausible motive and opportunity.  The story's climax is very typical Christie, wherein all of the suspects gather in the drawing room, and each explains his or her version of the `night of terror.'  There are a couple of false confessions, and finally Appleby explains ALL.<br />The mystery itself is very complex, and the solution rather contrived.  Read \\"Comedy of Terrors\\" for its highly literate prose---Appleby solves the mystery only after he recalls a verse from \\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\"--- and for its in-depth characterizations.	2003-02-23

The scene of the crime is a plush love nest on the outskirts of Paris where Rose Klonec had her midnight rendezvous with Death.  Not one but four different murder weapons are found in the room with her corpse.  The table is set for a feast.  Champagne abounds.<br />Bencolin must determine which one of her lovers or ex-lovers hated her enough to murder her---or was it a stranger, uninvited to the feast?<br />John Dickson Carr assembles a dashing, dissolute group of suspects that includes a reformed playboy, a high-stakes gambler, and a beautiful, young woman whose father was hanged for murder.  His Bencolin mysteries always include the following:<br />* A beautiful, neurasthenic young woman who at some point in the plot becomes the main suspect, and/or becomes convinced that she committed murder.<br />* A square-jawed Englishman who falls in love with the beautiful, but somewhat hysterical young woman.  The Englishman also serves as Bencolin's foil and eagerly pursues all of the plot's red herrings.<br />* A very complex mystery that usually involves a `locked room,' false murder weapons, complicated time-tables, and air-tight alibis (at least for the villains).<br />* A decadent, hot-house atmosphere, sometimes with a suggestion of the supernatural.  Unspeakable horror always lurks just down the dark, crimson-carpeted hall. All of the characters end up hyper-ventilating, not just the beautiful, young heroine.<br />I read the John Dickson Carr mysteries for their atmosphere.

This encyclopedia contains nearly a thousand illustrated entries covering eighty breeds of domestic cats, thirty-six species of wild cats, plus articles on feline anatomy, behavior, biology, folklore, history, literature and art.  Other sections list &quot;The 100 Best Cat Books,&quot; cat films, cat societies, and cat welfare organizations.  One of my favorite entries is a list of authors and their cats, and their quotations about cats.  For instance, Brian Aldiss and his cats, Macram&eacute;, Yum-Yum, Foxie, Jackson, and Nickie list the two things cats cannot stand:  &quot;The wretched Door, the horrid Fence.&quot;<br />The one deliberate omission in this encyclopedia is the subject of feline veterinary care.  A good reference for this sort of information is &quot;The Cornell Book of Cats,&quot; edited by Mordecai Siegal.<br />Morris, a trained zoologist, was the curator of mammals at the London Zoo from 1959 to 1971, where he was responsible for the largest collection of wild felines in the world. He has also authored other popular works on zoology, including &quot;The Naked Ape&quot; and &quot;Catwatching.&quot;<br /><br />As might be expected from his background, the author's entries on feline behavior are some of the most interesting in the encyclopedia.  Morris states that cats have a much greater acoustic range than dogs or humans, especially in their ability to hear high-pitched sounds.  Cats prefer to hunt by stealth and need to be able to detect the ultrasonic squeaking of their prey.<br />I'll never forget the time I accidentally shut one of my cats in the room with me when I was practicing my violin.  I happened to turn around and there was Calvin, pressing his enormous, furry body against the door, a piteous look in his eye.  After reading this encyclopedia, I prefer to blame his behavior on his enhanced acoustic range rather than taking it as a commentary on my musical ability.  After all, Calvin probably knew that violin strings used to be made of sheepgut, not catgut as is popularly believed.  Morris believes the term 'catgut' replaced 'sheepgut' because of the noises some people made while scraping on the strings.<br />As to why I turned around and saw him there, read Morris's entry on feline ESP.<br />'Cat World' is filled with feline anecdotes, both repeatable and some that are almost too bizarre to believe.

In my own experience, books about irises tend to fall into two categories:  beautiful and fun to read, but not particularly useful or well-organized; and books that I can take out into the garden and actually use.  This volume manages to straddle both categories, which is good because I like to look at beautiful pictures of irises, but I've also discovered that they are not particularly easy to grow.  I've lost two complete plantings of Bearded Irises to borers, and even managed to kill off a bed of hardy Siberian irises.<br />Why bother with a touchy plant that has such a short growing season?  That's easy:  because they're one of the most beautiful flowers in the garden when they do bloom.<br />The author has a gift for clear, succinct phrasing, very well-suited for a 'how to' manual on growing irises.  He also loves his subject--in the chapter on Louisiana Irises, he refers to himself as 'Johnny Iris Seed' because of his habit of planting his extra rhizomes in the mud at the margins of farm ponds, park pools, or even roadside ditches.  \\"Most will establish themselves and give pleasure to passersby in years to come.\\"<br />After forty years of growing irises, he has learned that a good garden springs from a healthy, living soil.  He suggests using pesticides and commercial fertilizers only as a last resort.  For instance, in the section on Iris borers, he starts with the least toxic methods for ridding your garden of these pests:  carefully clean up your garden debris in late fall and early spring to limit the number of borers that will hatch.  Monitor the young foliage fans for notches, then pinch the fan below the notches to squash any burrower (a mano a mano approach not recommended for the squeamish).<br />Irises can also be treated with beneficial nematodes.  I tried this method one year with some success, although the neighbors probably wondered why I was running around with what looked like a horse hypodermic and sticking it into iris stems.  According to this author, the nematodes can be sprayed on plants or used as a soil drench, so I can throw away my hypo.<br />\\"The Gardener's Iris Book\\" is fun to read straight through to the appendices on Iris specialist nurseries (listed by state), and iris books and computer resources.

Lang.  (Science teachers if you're not already familiar with Sun-Earth Day, check out NASA's website at sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov.  The theme this year is 'Live from the Aurora').<br />A relatively small-scale transient event on our Sun could mean life or death on Earth.  \\"Sun, Earth and Sky\\" will teach you about sunspots, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections: chunks of the Sun's outer atmosphere that blow off into space and can strike the Earth, causing aurorae and disrupting power grids and satellite communications.  We humans actually live within the Sun's atmosphere, so it should come as no surprise that this medium-size star plays a dominant role in our lives.  One of this book's main themes, as can be guessed from its title, is the interaction between the Sun and the Earth's atmosphere through radiation and high-energy particles.<br />As with all astronomy texts, \\"Sun, Earth and Sky\\" went out-of-date immediately after publication in 1995 and does not contain recent discoveries such as solar tornadoes (first imaged by SOHO in 1998), the Solar Max 2000 research, or the data from RHESSI (Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager) space probe, launched in early 2002.  However, that's no excuse not to read this book.  I originally bought it to learn more about the interaction between solar flares and the Earth's magnetosphere (very lucidly explained), but soon found myself leafing through it just to look at the beautiful pictures (133 including 61 in color).<br />Dr. Lang starts out by describing the Sun as a cosmic laboratory--a site to test physical theories under conditions not readily attainable on Earth.  He proceeds painlessly, i.e. without too much math or nuclear physics, to describe the inner Sun, \\"an unseen world of perpetual change and cosmic violence.\\"  Along with more standard illustrations, he also includes paintings by Turner and Monet.  His chapters on the violent, visible solar phenomena such as CME (coronal mass ejections) are among the most interesting in the book.<br />And who would have guessed that we haven't yet solved the puzzle of the Sun's million-degree corona, even though its temperature has been known since the late nineteenth century.<br />As Dr. Lang approaches Earth he drills down into such topics as our planet's magnetosphere, our atmosphere and its vanishing ozone, and the effect that an 'inconstant sun' has on our well-being--indeed, on our very survival as a species.<br />I highly recommend \\"Sun, Earth and Sky\\" to anyone who is interested in a thorough grounding in solar astronomy.<br />For completely up-to-date information on our Sun, check out the soho[...]  There are some great pictures courtesy of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO).

Hazelwood and Michaud do not attempt to decipher the 'why' of serial killers in \\"Dark Dreams.\\"  They concentrate on the different types of 'how,' and what the 'how' reveals about the serial killer.<br />For instance, one of the authors' major themes is the narcissism of serial killers.  Many of them come to believe that they are too smart for the police to catch, and start taking unnecessary chances.  Some even write taunting letters to the police, e.g. the Zodiac Killer, or commit a crime under the very noses of their pursuers.  An example of the latter type of behavior was demonstrated by the stalker, Andrew Johnstone, who stole his victim's underwear out of a Salvation Army box that the police had under twenty-four hour surveillance.  The authors point out that a safer method to obtain the same result would have been to steal his victim's bras off of her clothesline.<br />A few other common characteristics of serial killers that the authors spend some time with are their ritualistic behavior, their employment of paid or compliant partners to 'practice' on, and their use of  detective magazines as 'how to' manuals.  A range of deviant behaviors including fetishism, necrophilia, sadism, masochism, and autoeroticism are touched upon although the authors concentrate on ritualistic sexual sadists as \\"the most resourceful, destructive, and elusive of all deviant offenders.\\"<br />One of the authors, Roy Hazelwood\\" also co-authored a book on \\"Autoerotic Fatalities\\" and  \\"Dark Dreams\\" follows up on this theme and explains how profilers determine whether a particular death is suicide, homicide, or an unfortunate accident.<br />How would you interpret the case where a teen-age boy's nude body was discovered hanging inside a vertical sewer pipe, his face covered in duct tape, and his grandfather's watch taped inside his mouth?  Read the chapter on \\"Equivocal Deaths\\" and learn how FBI profiler and co-author, Roy Hazelwood determined exactly what had occurred.<br />This book is a dark journey into the human mind, quite graphic at times, and should probably be stamped \\"For mature readers only.\\"how profilers determine whether a particular death is suicide, homicide, or an unfortunate accident.<br />How would you interpret the case where a teen-age boy's nude body was discovered hanging inside a vertical sewer pipe, his face covered in duct tape, and his grandfather's watch taped inside his mouth?

They were un-put-downable. I had to read through the night to finish them. Cooper has one of the most original, malign, and imaginative minds in the fantasy business. When I was unable to locate the two other books of the Time Master prequel, I started working my way through one of her earlier series: the Indigo books, of which \\"Nemesis\\" is the first.<br /><br />\\"Nemesis\\" is the story of a Celtic Pandora named Anghara who opens the wrong box and lets evil back into the world. There are large sections of imaginative, Cooperesque fantasy and well worth reading. In fact, I've already ordered the second book in the Indigo series. However, overall I'd have to guess that 'Nemesis' is one of Cooper's first ventures into fantasy. The heroine is an arrogant, impulsive, headstrong adolescent who doesn't really change through the course of the book, even though her whole family is slaughtered by the demons she frees, and her lover is condemned to purgatory until she can rescue him.<br />The lover is the character I really feel sorry for. He is brave, kind, and completely innocent of wrong-doing and yet he is condemned to a particularly awful life-in-death while Anghara-Indigo escapes pretty much unscathed from her own act of wickedness (her hair turns gray and a few months into the plot, she sprains her ankle).<br /><br />With occasional pick-me-ups from the Earth Mother, Anghara-Indigo sets out to recapture the demons she let loose on the world, hindered by her nemesis (an evil copy of herself with what appear to be vast supernatural powers) and helped by a talking wolf.<br />'Nemesis' is a good fantasy and worth reading, just not as good as Cooper's later books.	2003-02-02

A village of copper miners is coerced into joining the cult of Charchad, who turns out to be one of the demons that Anghara/Indigo loosed upon the world in Book One of this series. Anyway, Charchad forces the villagers to mine uranium (we never learn why), and death, radiation poisoning, and really icky mutations make life miserable for all who stumble into his realm. Indigo and Grimya, her talking wolf, join forces with Jasker, a priest of the Fire Goddess Ranaya, in order to destroy the cult of Charchad and the demon, Aszareel.<br /><br />Indigo spends a large part of \\"Inferno\\" trapped in lava flows, torturing a mine overseer (who, admittedly, is slimy, revolting character), and snarling at her allies. I can't figure out why anyone would like her or want to help her, especially the poor wolf.<br /><br />\\"Nemesis: Book One of Indigo\\" was definitely a better read than \\"Inferno: Book Two of Indigo\\". I'm still debating whether I should venture into Book Three. I keep hoping Indigo will lose the stuttering wolf and develop a more winning personality, because I really admire Louise Cooper's writing ability. Her \\"Time Master\\" trilogy is one of the best reads in Fantasy.<br />Maybe the \\"Indigo\\" series is just not for me. Check out \\"Inferno\\" if you must, but Niven & Pournelle's \\"Inferno\\" is a far better read (not to mention Dante Alighieri's).	2003-02-02

There isn't much of a plot to \\"Wait Till Next Year\\"--Brooklyn girl and rabid Dodger fan grows up very Catholic in the late '40s and early '50s, while her mother slowly wastes away and dies.  The title is a catch phrase that Brooklyn Dodgers fans used over and over again when their team was eliminated from the pennant race for yet another year.  Dodgers trivia jostles against family history, and wonderful set-pieces on, for instance what it was like to own the first television on the block.<br />If you were a city girl who grew up during this same period in America, many of the author's stories will resonate with you:  not being able to play in the water on a hot summer's day, not even a wading pool, because of your parent's fear of polio; ducking under your desk or filing down into the furnace room during your school's air-raid drills; the book-and-brick smell of the local public library, where each of the books had a date-stamped sheet glued to its back cover.<br /><br />Is that really me and my sister in the photograph on the back cover, or did all little girls wear bangs and plaid back then?<br />The most angst-filled stories in the book were about the author's father, who raised his young sister after being orphaned at an early age.  His brother died of tetanus, his mother in child-birth, and his father, of grief.  His one remaining sister died a few years later in a freak accident, but he managed to pull himself together after all of those untimely deaths, educated himself, got married, had children, became a Brooklyn Dodgers fan--all of this without self-pity or rancor.  Maybe he really did belong to 'The Greatest Generation.'<br />This is a sweet coming-of-age story, guilelessly told--an excellent read for a nostalgic baby-boomer or a rabid baseball fan.	2003-01-27

But if you have a mordant sense of humor, try attending a convention of pathologists and forensic scientists--especially if Dr. Baden is scheduled to speak.  They usually meet near Reno and book Wayne Newton in to entertain them.<br />(I don't know why medical examiners are so endeared with Wayne Newton.  This might be one of those deep philosophical conundrums that ordinary mortals should not speculate upon lest they go blind).<br />Did you know that it is possible to special-order a pair of diamond-studded handcuffs?<br />This is just one of the fascinating tidbits that Dr. Baden and Marion Roach share with us in \\"Dead Reckoning.\\"  This book is more of an overview of modern forensic pathology than was their previous volume, \\"Unnatural Death,\\" which was primarily a series of Dr. Baden's criminal cases.  In \\"Dead Reckoning\\" we are introduced to other famous (in their own circle, at least) forensic scientists such as the bug man, Dr. Neal Haskell (his specialty is my least favorite part of crime solving) and Dr. Henry Lee, the American 'Sherlock Holmes' whose Connecticut Forensic Science Laboratory was involved in the infamous 'wood chipper' case (there was a very thorough murderer, indeed).<br />The authors also illuminate criminal cases where Dr. Baden had no direct involvement, such as the O.J. Simpson murder trial.  It was shocking to learn how badly the crime scene was handled in this particular case.<br />\\"Dead Reckoning\\" is a must-read for true crime buffs.  It also helps to have a peculiar sense of humor.	2003-01-25

I've read more recent books on true crime and haven't come across Norris's psychological or physical profiles of serial killers.  I don't know whether this means his assertions are being ignored, or whether his work has been superceded or found to be incorrect.<br />At any rate, it is very absorbing reading.  Dr. Norris takes the reader right into the bizarre, distorted mind of a serial killer.  The author should know how they think, since he is a psychologist who has worked within the American prison system and has had the opportunity to interview several serial killers face-to-face, including Theodore Bundy, Henry Lee Lucas, and Bobby Joe Long.  In his preface, Dr. Norris claims to performed five hundred interviews over a period of four years (my assumption is that he interviewed the same person multiple times, as I don't think there are five hundred serial killers in prison even over a four year period).  What he found was that the patterns of parental abuse, violence, neglect, childhood cognitive disabilities, and alcohol and drug abuse were virtually identical for all of the convicted killers that he interviewed.<br />One of most important developments in the battle against serial murder was the formation of the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit in Quantico, Virginia.  Dr. Norris discusses several of the cases they solved, and also goes into detail about patterns of behavior they detected.  For instance, serial killers are compulsive trollers, who travel over ever widening areas to locate their victims.  The trolling patterns appear very early, even before they commit their first rape or murder.  They also experience a biological rhythm very akin to a menstrual cycle.  For some, the cycles of behavior are akin to deep brain seizures that alter perception and behavior without physically incapacitating the individual.<br />Dr. Norris focuses about a quarter of his book on five serial killers who tell the stories of their lives and their crimes in their own words.  The five are Henry Lee Lucas (sentence commuted to life in prison by then-Governor George W. Bush in June, 1999), Carlton Gary (still on Georgia's Death row), Bobby Joe Long (still on Florida's Death row), Leonard Lake (committed suicide while in custody of the San Francisco police), and Charles Manson (in San Quentin, awaiting parole).<br />The chapter on Charles Manson is especially interesting, because the author discusses serial killers in groups, i.e. 'killing pairs' or 'families.'  Almost 28% of all serial killers bond with others and commit their crimes in company.  Killing pairs such as Leonard Lake and Charles Ng, the father/son team of Joseph and Michael Kallinger, the Kenneth Bianchi/Angelo Buono team of Hillside Stranglers, and the homosexual companions Henry Lee Lucas and Ottis Toole all emerged as subjects of study in the 1980s.<br />If killing pairs are so common, why were all of the criminal profilers (those on T.V., at least) so surprised when the Maryland sniper deaths turned out to have been caused by not one, but two men?<br />Maybe they should have read \\"Serial Killers\\" before going public with their theories.<br />Last of all, Dr. Norris develops his own profile of a serial killer, including a list of \\"Twenty-one Patterns of Episodic Aggressive Behavior\\" that includes items like \\"Ritualistic behavior,\\" \\"Extraordinary cruelty to animals,\\" \\"Evidence of genetic disorders,\\" etc.  I found this author to have planted himself firmly on both sides of the nature versus nurture debate.<br />I bought this book second-hand and one of the more disturbing things I discovered while reading Dr. Norris's list of twenty-one behaviors, was that someone who had read the book before me had initialed eight of the twenty-one items!incapacitating the individual.<br />Dr. Norris focuses about a quarter of his book on five serial killers who tell the stories of their lives and their crimes in their own words.

She is also a sympathetic listener, although the sound of her knitting needles going click click click might eventually drive her confidant to homicide.  That's okay too, since Miss Silver is also a private detective (shades of Miss Marple!).<br /><br />Even though \\"The Benevent Treasure\\" has a little old lady detective who knits socks for her nephew, it's not exactly what I would call a 'cozy.'  It's the story of two sisters who are so warped by their dominating Victorian father and his screwy legacy that they spend the rest of their lives alone together (except for servants) on the ancient Benevent estate, irritating the living daylights out of each other.  A third sister was kicked out of the family for marrying beneath herself, and eventually turned her unmarried siblings into great-aunts, although the two branches of the family don't speak to each other.<br /><br />The story really begins with the Benevent sisters' great-niece, Candida Sayle while she is on a vacation at the sea shore with a school friend.  As Candida registers at the seaside hotel, two old ladies dressed in black recommend that she go for a nice walk along the seashore.  High tide doesn't occur until 11 P.M., so she has plenty of time for a stroll.  Since her friends' train hasn't arrived yet, Candida decides to take their advice, and soon finds herself trapped on the tiny ledge of a very high cliff by a tide that came rolling in at 9 P.M.<br /><br />The teen-ager is rescued by a young man who is studying to be an architect.  When they get back to the hotel, the two ladies in black have vanished.<br /><br />Five years pass while Candida, who is an orphan, nurses her aunt Barbara through her final illness.  After her aunt's death, Candida receives a letter from the Benevent sisters, inviting her to come live on the ancestral estate with them.  They represent a branch of the family that would have nothing to do with Candida's grandmother after her marriage.  Nevertheless Candida decides to pay a prolonged visit with her great-aunts (whom she has never met), since she has nowhere else go.<br /><br />Candida makes a well-mannered entrance to the old, Elizabethan family manor at tea-time and we get our first glimpse of the two great-aunts:  forbidding, ramrod-stiff Olivia (the youngest sister); and timid Cara (think of Scarlet and Melanie if they'd been buttoned up in the same plantation all of their lives, and had never flirted with anyone, much less Rhett or Ashley).  Right away, the mysteries begin to pile up.  Candida dozes off for a second while her Great-Aunt Olivia is droning on about the proud family lineage, and she dreams that her two old relatives are actually the women in black who tried to drown her five years past.  The hidden family treasure (emerald buttons, gold plate, a golden figurine by Cellini) is mentioned.

Read \\"Sabriel\\" and \\"Lirael\\" before undertaking \\"Abhorsen,\\" so that you can familiarize yourself with the Philosophy and Geography of Death.  Nix isn't into summarization or repetition. He plunges his reader right into a whirlpool of death, animated corpses, and Charter magic.  If you don't already know such characters as the Disreputable Dog, the necromancer Hedge, or his bone-headed companion, Nick, you might never figure out what's going on.<br />This book is a direct continuation of \\"Lirael,\\" with the ex-assistant librarian and her companion, Prince Sameth carrying on the battle against Hedge and the evil he is digging up at Red Lake.  Although Prince Sameth was meant to be the Abhorsen-in-Waiting, heir to the powers of 'The Book of the Dead' and the seven bells, Lirael now takes up that role, and Sam seeks his destiny as a descendant of the mysterious Wallmakers, who built the barrier between the magical Old Kingdom and the mundane kingdom of Ancelstierre.  The two will need all of the magic they can conjure up against an enemy that threatens not only the Charter, but all living beings.<br />The swirl and cross-currents of life gradually ebb as the dead pass through gate after gate on Garth Nix's nameless river--a river like Styx or Lethe that runs through each of our subconscious underworlds as a legacy of our water-bound gestation.

You'll soon be seeing vampires along every canal, dressed in very weird costumes and masks.  The heroine of this novel has three costume changes, including an outfit in fire-engine red vinyl that is an irresistible lure for the undead.  Jordan thought she had buried her past when she left South Carolina but there is a mysterious masked dottore who seems to show up whenever she wanders alone on the streets of Venice, after midnight (this happens often).<br />Another mysterious stranger, who is disguised as a wolf rescues Jordan from a masked ball where the other guests turn into demons and devour each other.

One might even say that Jared tries to suck up to the contessa, but really it happens the other way around.<br />Jordan, who makes her living as a book reviewer (yay!) flies to New Orleans to interview an author who seems to know a great deal about vampires.<br />If \\"Deep Midnight\\" sound a lot like warmed-over Rice (Anne, that is), well that's what it is, except the sex isn't nearly as imaginative.  There is even a long, rather dull history of how the tall, blonde stranger and the partying contessa got turned into nosferati, way back during the Age of Vikings.<br />The main thing I'd like to find out is how Jordan got paid for her book reviews.<br />However, if you decide you could really go for a Viking vampire, read this book.  The Venetian background is mildly interesting, although I'll never understand why vampires who are allergic to seawater would choose to live in a city that is sinking into the Adriatic.  (This peculiarity does lead to an unintentionally hysterical scene where Jordan sloshes a bucket of canal water over her blood-sucking pursuers.)<br />NOTE:  Also try typing 'nosferati' into your search engine.

This novel is basically a British comedy of manners, thinly disguised as a whodunit.  It is narrated in the first person by Arthur, one of the suspects who happens to be a writer:<br />The aristocratic Arthur and his relatives gather for the Christmas holiday at Belrive Priory, the ancient family seat in the north of England.  Much to their dismay, they learn that the current owner of Belrive, Arthur's cousin Basil, is planning to sell his estate to a brewer.<br />Basil, the seventh Baronet of Belrive Priory, needs the money to fund an expedition to the Arctic.<br />When Basil's nephew Wilfred is shot, every one wonders whether Basil had been the real target---and whether there would be a second, fatal attempt on the seventh Baronet's life.<br />Inspector John Appleby happens to be a guest at dinner on the night of the shooting.  The local constable is only too happy to turn the crime over to the young CID inspector, and so Appleby enters the fray with Arthur serving as his Watson and family historian.<br />Michael Innes (pseudonym for John Innes Mackintosh Stewart) has out-Agatha'd Christie in this early Appleby.  Each character is suspected in turn, and each has a plausible motive and opportunity.  The story's climax is very typical Christie, wherein all of the suspects gather in the drawing room, and each explains his or her version of the `night of terror.'  There are a couple of false confessions, and finally Appleby explains ALL.<br />The mystery itself is very complex, and the solution rather contrived.  Read \\"There Came both Mist and Snow\\" for its highly literate prose--Appleby solves the mystery only after he recalls a verse from \\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" (hence the book's title)--and for its in-depth characterizations.	2003-01-12

However, she does occasionally reveal a playful side to her husband.<br />At the beginning of \\"The Crabtree Affair,\\" the reader finds Sir John and his wife strolling along a disused canal, one fine English summer day.  They indulge in affectionately ironic conversation, making it obvious that theirs is a long-standing marriage (although as I remember, they also talked that way to each other before marriage---see \\"Appleby's End\\").<br />Eventually (you knew this was going to happen), the Applebys find a body floating face-down in the scummy canal-water.  The quest for the murderer of returned prodigal, Seth Crabtree, proceeds in the leisurely fashion of a Golden Age British manor house mystery.  It is leavened, as are all of Michael Innes's novels, with a great deal of erudite wit and conversation.  It has not one, but two snobbish butlers, and also features Judith's eccentric great-uncle, Colonel Raven whose life's work-in-progress is the \\"Atlas and Entomology of the Dry-Fly Streams of England.\\"<br />If you are a already a fan of Margery Allingham, Edmund Crispin, or Dorothy Sayers, you definitely need to add Michael Innes's mysteries to your reading list.  \\"The Crabtree Affair\\" is perfect in its class, and you will also learn quite a bit about the English Canal system.	2003-01-05

He was educated at Oriel College, Oxford, and his mysteries reflect both his scholarship (the title of this book is from a poem by Thomas Hardy), and the year he spent in Vienna, studying Freudian psychoanalysis.<br />The setting of `Journeying Boy' (1949) is a product of the two years Innes spent at Queen's University in Belfast. I believe it is the only one of his mysteries to take place in Ireland.  It is also notable in that it does not feature his most famous detective, Sir John Appleby, but rather Appleby's successor at New Scotland Yard, Detective-Inspector Thomas Cadover. The new Inspector is a bit of a dry stick compared to the irrepressible Appleby---he refers to his predecessor as `the wayward Appleby'---but Cadover detects with the best of his literary kin (Appleby, Lord Peter, Professor Fen, etc.) All of the characters are introspective (remember that year in Vienna) and finely drawn.  No caricatures are to be found in `Journeying Boy'---not even the nuclear physicist.<br />Not even the Irish.<br />The narrative duties are divided between three main characters:  Inspector Cadover; Humphrey Paxton, the adolescent son of a famous nuclear physicist; and Richard Thewless, the middle-aged and somewhat unimaginative tutor who is hired to take Humphrey on a vacation to Ireland.  As always with Innes, the mystery is a mixture of high drama and low farce.  `Journeying Boy' doesn't quite venture into the surreal depths of some of the Appleby novels.  However, Innes displays his talent for hallucinatory description in several places, including a scene where the tutor, Mr. Thewless is stumbling through the dark halls of a draughty, decaying Irish country house.  Just as he becomes certain that he is being followed, his candle gutters out:<br />\\"All of the objects...that lined the broad corridors of the house were swathed in a white sheeting...It was as if, in addition to the [mansion's family and servants], the place owned another body of inhabitants, who waited, shrouded and silent in the gathering dusk.&quot;<br />Even though `Journeying Boy' mentions Appleby only in passing, it is one of Innes's best, most intricate mysteries.  This author can switch from farce to horror better and faster than any of his contemporaries.  You'll be laughing while your hair is still standing straight up on the back of your neck.  If you don't believe me, read the chapter that takes place in a labyrinth of sea caves, where the boy Humphrey attempts to escape from his enemies.<br />Michael Innes is one of the finest, most unjustly neglected authors from the British Golden Age of Mystery.

This author never suffers from a dearth of suspects or motives.<br />Judge Horace Ireton is proud of the fact that he administers absolute, impartial justice without a drop of mercy.  At the end of the Westshire spring assizes, he sentences a man to death with all due ceremony--the square of black silk on his wig, the ominous roll of words that end: \\"...and there be hanged by the neck until you are dead.  And may God have mercy on your soul.\\"  Then the judge decides to take a short vacation in his bungalow by the sea.  He challenges the eccentric Dr. Fell to a chess match as part of his R&R program, and in pops the judge's daughter and announces that she is engaged to be married--and not to the dried stick of a barrister whom her father had hand-picked for her.<br />Dr. Fell, who isn't without a clumsy sort of tact lumbers off-scene.  Judge Ireton is introduced to the new fianc&eacute;, whom he recognizes as a man who was once tried and acquitted of extorting money from his previous betrothed's family.  Sure enough, the man offers to back out of his current engagement if the judge sheds enough pounds from his bank account.<br />Twenty-four hours later, a murder occurs under seemingly impossible conditions.  Everyone within a square mile of the judge's bungalow has an excellent motive for doing away with the victim.  It's up to Dr. Fell to play a grim sort of cat-and-mouse game with the real killer and obtain a confession.<br />How did the corpse get from the scene of the murder to the judge's bungalow or did the shooting somehow occur in the bungalow?  Did you know that Canadian taxidermists sometimes stuff their moose heads with sand?  Who is the dried stick of a barrister (who turns out to be a pretty decent sort) really in love with?  Who tries to drown his newly-discovered love in a darkened, subterranean swimming pool?<br />Carr provides lots of interesting side-tracks and tricksy turns, as is usual in his mysteries.a pretty decent sort) really in love with?

The characters say \\"What ho\\" more times than Bertie Wooster.  What starts out as the story of a young man who is afraid to tell his father, the Bishop of Mapleham that he spent his time in America at speakeasies and hanging out with loose women, instead of attending criminology courses at Columbia University, ends in attempted murder and murder.  The farcical characters fade from view and we hear no more 'what ho's after about the middle of the book.<br />Carr's serial detective, the humungous Dr. Gideon Fell, galumphs into view disguised as the Viennese psychiatrist, Dr. Sigismund Von Hornswoggle.  He fools no one, least of all his friend Chief Inspector Hadley.  In fact, Hadley is glad to see the enormous, eccentrically-dressed detective, as he is being badgered to investigate the case of a bishop who seems to have gone mad, and is caught sliding down banisters, attacking maids, and creeping about on his host's leads in the middle of the night.  There is also the mystery of the poltergeist who biffed a vicar in the eye with an inkpot.<br />While in Hadley's office, Colonel Standish, who is currently hosting the eccentric bishop and the poltergeist, is informed that a man has been murdered on his estate back in Gloucestershire.  The deceased was discovered with a tarot card clutched in his hand:  the Eight of Swords, a minor arcana, which symbolizes (according to Fell) Condemning Justice.<br />The eccentric Bishop of Mapleham, his errant son, and Dr. Fell pile into Colonel Standish's tonneau  (this book was first published in 1934) and set off for Gloucestershire to investigate the mystery surrounding the dead man.<br />\\"The Eight of Swords\\" leans more toward farce than Carr's usual blend of mystery and ominous, supernatural doom, although there is one rather creepy chase scene toward the end of the book.  It is a fun read and one of the author's less complicated mysteries--actually it's the only one of his mysteries where I've been able to correctly pick the murderer before the grand denouement at the end of the story.thor's less complicated mysteries--actually it's the only one of his mysteries where I've been able to correctly pick the murderer before the grand denouement at the end of the story.	2002-12-23

All of the characters act suspiciously, including the true and false heir to the extensive Farnleigh estate (and the title that goes with it), their two lawyers, the butler, Lady Farnleigh, and assorted family friends.  The reader has many reasons to suspect each character in turn after the murder (or was it suicide?) of one of the two competing heirs.  The only person who might be able to tell whether the true John Farnleigh died or still lives is his tutor, Murray who happens to have taken a thumb-o-graph of young John before he was sent away to America to live with a distant relative.<br />John wasn't the heir, but the black sheep of the family when he was packed off to Colorado via the spanking, new ocean liner, 'Titanic.'  He was thought to have died when his ship sank on her maiden voyage, but after his older brother dies without issue, not one but two John Farnleighs show up within a year of each other to claim the family estate and title.  The first one to appear marries John's childhood sweetheart and settles down to manage Farnleigh.<br />Then up pops John Farnleigh #2, one of the competing heirs dies, and someone steals Murray's thumb-o-graph.  The reader is beset with conflicting stories and clues, when Dr. Fell finally lumbers onto the scene with his shovel-hat, swirling cape, and crutch-headed cane.  He figures out who killed whom right away, but the reader is left grasping at hints (some of them pretty darn subtle - I think Carr cheats a little on this mystery) until the final denouement, which involves that fateful night when the 'Titanic' went down.<br />As always with this author, the eerie, suffocating atmosphere surrounding a mysterious death is tinged with an aura of the supernatural.  \\"The Crooked Hinge\\" features devil worship and a horrible old eighteenth-century automaton called, 'The Golden Hag.'  Her sinister appearances alone make this a novel worth savoring, and Carr also provides a meticulously plotted mystery (although I could do without a few of his great detective's tics and his refusal to blab out the name of the murderer as soon as he figures out whodunit.

If you enjoy tales of the supernatural, be sure to check out two of his previous collections (with R.A.

Cox has included one of E.F. Benson's most frightening stories (which is saying a great deal), plus a couple of classical haunted house stories, plus a few seldom-collected stories from otherwise well-known authors of the supernatural:<br />\\"Wicked Captain Walshawe, of Wauling (1864)\\" by J.S.

Riddell - tiny, wet footprints follow a man to the wedding altar and beyond.  A long, seldom-collected tale of revenge from beyond the grave that is as populated with interesting (but irrelevant) minor characters as a Dickens novel.<br />\\"Number 13 (1904)\\" by M.R. James - A Danish hotel room vanishes in the morning and reappears at night, inhabited by one who had sold his soul to the devil.<br />\\"Railhead (1908)\\" by Perceval Landon - A plot to steal a construction crew's payroll is complicated by ghostly telegraph messages.<br />\\"The Toll-House (1909)\\" by W.W.

In a recurrent nightmare, a woman sees a graveyard that is slowly eroding into the sea.  Someone waits for her there.<br />\\"The Tool (1928)\\" by W.F.

It is fascinating to learn how the FBI and other law enforcement agents were able to catch the original bombers so quickly, through forensic evidence left at the bomb site.  Many of the most interesting cases in this book involve bombs, including the explosion of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland that was eventually traced to the Libyans, the extortionist who was blowing up transmission towers in the Pacific Northwest, and the package bomb that killed federal judge Robert Vance.  The FBI really shines in cases such as these, where sometimes thousands of pieces of potential evidence have to be analyzed, and hundreds of leads have to be followed--which makes me a bit uneasy about our current Administration's effort to turn FBI agents into something other than the world's best crime solvers.<br />Sometimes there is very little evidence:  a tiny chip of pink paint off of a girl's bicycle convicted one murderer; a partial egg casing from a body louse, another.<br />Inside the FBI's sci-crime lab, the author divides his narrative between the Chemistry/Toxicology Unit, Explosives, Hairs and Fiber, Latent Fingerprint and DNA Analysis, Documents, Firearms and Toolmarks, and the Special Photography, Video Enhancement, and Polygraph Units.  He uses obscure cases as well as famous ones to illuminate the techniques employed by each group of experts.  FBI forensic scientists have to become experts in arcana that most of us wouldn't think about in a life-time.<br />(Unless we plan to commit a federal crime.  Then we'd better think hard about all of them.  It worries me that the copy of \\"Hard Evidence\\" I read was heavily underlined, especially in the chapter on explosives).<br />Some of the cases in \\"Hard Evidence\\" depended upon expertise in identifying the origin of a feather, showing the difference between wig and Barbie doll hair, and intimate knowledge of the process used to manufacture plastic garbage bags.<br /><br />I did find one minor misstatement in the author's discussion of body fluids left at crime scenes:  forensic dentistry helped convict Theodore Bundy, but it was the bite-mark pattern left by the assailant, not the saliva left in the wound as stated in this book.  The forensic dentist recognized that the murderer had a chip on his front tooth that made a unique pattern on his victim. He was then able to recreate the identical pattern using the model of Bundy's teeth.<br />Even so, \\"Hard Evidence\\" is a good read.  Those who are already knowledgeable about forensics and American crime will find never-before-published cases that illuminate even the most obscure connection between science and the evil that men do.of the process used to manufacture plastic garbage bags.<BR> <BR>I did find one minor misstatement in the author's discussion of body fluids left at crime scenes:  forensic dentistry helped convict Theodore Bundy, but it was the bite-mark pattern left by the assailant, not the saliva left in the wound as stated in this book.

Long sections are devoted to the Ismailis and the Order of Assassins, Vlad the Impaler, the Marquis de Sade, and the author's philosophical speculations on why men become criminals.  His theory of criminology is influenced by A.E. van Vogt's speculations on \\"the right man\\" and the \\"dominant five percent,\\" and on Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs.  (After reading this book, I'm sure that Colin Wilson would classify the motive for the recent sniper killings as the need for self-esteem).<br />Maslow believed that human beings are motivated by unsatisfied needs, and that certain lower needs need to be satisfied before higher needs can be addressed.  There is a hierarchy of needs (physiological, safety, love, and esteem) that must be satisfied before a person can act unselfishly. As long as we are motivated to satisfy these cravings, we are moving toward self-actualization. Satisfying needs is healthy.  Blocking gratification makes us sick or evil.<br />Wilson attempts to use Maslow's hierarchy of needs to find historical patterns in crime.  For instance if men are starving or homeless, they might commit crimes to satisfy their physiological needs.  According to the author, men didn't start indulging in sex crimes (to satisfy the need for love or self-esteem) until they were clothed, fed, and housed, i.e. sometime after the Industrial Revolution.<br />The Victorians invented rape?  I don't think so.<br />If it weren't for the author's philosophical discursions and his attitude toward victims versus the \\"dominant five percent\\" of society (CEOs, Prime Ministers, and leaders of all sorts, including criminals), I'd give \\"The Mammoth Book of True Crime 2\\" another star. Colin Wilson is a masterful narrator when he sticks to the actual facts of the crimes. But his tendency to denigrate victims (\\"they were just prostitutes,\\" \\"she had a face like a horse\\") and defend certain mass murderers, e.g. Hasan bin Sabbah (who founded the Order of Assassins, and became the first Old Man of the Mountain), Vlad the Impaler, and Charlie Manson, leads me to recommend against reading this book unless you already have strong convictions of your own concerning murderer versus victim.<br />A much better, more coherent book about crime is \\"Forty Years of Murder\\" by the British forensic pathologist, Keith Simpson.cts of the crimes.

It starts out like a 'noir' police procedural. There are actually two mass murderers on the loose in Yorkshire, one a 'standard' serial killer who (usually)preys on isolated women. The other is an evil sorcerer who has assumed the trappings of a late twentieth century 'faith healer'. Detective Superintendent Vernon Laverne, the hero of \\"The Death Prayer\\" has already captured one serial killer before the book begins. His colleagues on the force applaud his results, but are suspicious of his intuitive style of detection.<br />Excellent character development, and chilling, bone-twisting scenes of supernatural horror are the hooks that make \\"The Death Prayer\\" well worth reading. Vernon Laverne is much better developed, and consequently more interesting than the standard run of paranormal detectives who rely on gimmicks (magic rings, pentacles, weird ceremonies, etc.) to get their man (or demon).<br />You're really going to admire him by book's end.<br />Speaking of book's end, I subtracted a star because the end is a messy, anti-climax to the horror that occurred earlier in the plot. The scene in the Cathedral on New Year's Eve is especially chilling, and my only wish is that the book's end could have reached a similar height.	2002-12-01

If you think you might enjoy a unicorn snuff film, you'll probably relish this short story collection.  Beagle has collected a diverse set of fantasies about creatures very unlike the traditional colt-like being with a horn and a penchant for virgins (although a few of those time-honored beasts do show up in strange settings).  He could very easily have done a bit of cut and paste and called his book, \\"Immortal Dragon,\\" or \\"Immortal Manticore\\" for all the 'unicorn-ness' of the featured mythical beast.<br />Here is a sampling of the stories, starting with my two favorites:<br />\\"Professor Gottesman and the Indian Rhinoceros\\" by Peter S. Beagle - A unicorn in the guise of a smelly Indian Rhinoceros that loves to discuss the Scholastics and take hot baths?  It works for Beagle, who exhibits his usual deft touch at the border between life and immortality.<br />\\"Gilgamesh Recidivus\\" by P.D. Cacek - a grim story of a man who tracks a unicorn through the cold barrens of Siberia, in order to beg for death, not immortality.<br />\\"The Devil on Myrtle Ave.\\" by Eric Lustbader - a long, somewhat incoherent tale of a stone killer whose mother ODs on the first page.  A little silver unicorn dangles from his nose chain as he goes about his daily rounds of break-ins, armed robberies, and murder.<br />\\"The Trouble with Unicorns\\" by Nancy Willard - A man has his beloved cat put down due to the infirmities of old age.  While looking for another pet, he finds an ad for an enrocinul.<br />\\"Old One-Antler\\" by Michael Armstrong - A man takes his thirteen-year-old son on a hunting trip to teach him how to shoot.  A bull caribou with a missing horn instructs the father on the true meaning of manhood.<br />\\"Taken He Cannot Be\\" by Will Shetterly - Wyatt Earp and Doc Holiday go hunting a rustler and find him at creek-side, three sheets to the wind and reading aloud from the \\"Illiad.\\"  A unicorn accompanies the posse of two.	2002-11-30

Each of the four collections has the same prologue by Robert Adams, which explains how the fair originated in Ithkar (a religious anniversary turned pilgrimage), the set-up (temple, campgrounds for the merchants, docks and canals for the riparian traffic, etc.), and the difficulties encountered on a pilgrimage or trading voyage to Ithkar (Death Swamp, dragons, outlaw wizards).  All weapons must be surrendered before entering the fair and wizards are discouraged from glamorizing shoddy goods with their spells.  Of course, as at any large festival, the fair at Ithkar has its share of rogues, piratical merchants, bravos, potion-makers and witches, troupes of entertainers (not a few of them turning tricks), and gullible pilgrims.<br />A sampling of stories:<br />\\"The Goblinry of Ais\\" by Lin Carter -  a rather pedestrian story on the theme of 'be careful what you wish for,' especially if the genie in the rock happens to be a goblin.<br />\\"To Take a Thief\\" by C.J. Cherryh - A young apprentice-thief's master hangs from a gibbet down near the docks.  How will he survive at a fair already overrun by thieves, and worse?<br />\\"Jezeri and her Beast Go to the Fair and Find more Excitement than They Want.\\" by Jo Clayton - this story about a young girl and her mysterious telepathic pet is written like a chapter taken out of a novel.  It's a 'day in the life of' rather than a story with a true ending.  I checked Jo Clayton's bibliography to see if Jezeri and her Beast came whole-cloth out of a novel, but didn't find anything to indicate that it did.<br />\\"Fletcher Found\\" by Morgan Llywelyn - One of my favorites.  A young fletcher is robbed of his wares on the way to Ithkar, but manages to replenish part of his stock of arrows with the help of a peculiar wild magic.  His new arrows are not precisely saleable.<br />\\"Well Met in Ithkar\\" by Patricia Mathews - A blind jewelry maker is fighting long odds when she identifies a priest of Thotharn as the man who ruined her family.aleable.<br />\\"Well Met in Ithkar\\" by Patricia Mathews - A blind jewelry maker is fighting long odds when she identifies a priest of Thotharn as the man who ruined her family.	2002-11-19

The authors' stated intention is to make readers feel &quot;at home in the Cosmos,&quot; although many of the astronomical photographs might leave us a bit in awe of the place where we live. In fact, I'm surprised that the authors didn't use more images from the Hubble space telescope.  Perhaps it is because their stated intention is to explain, not simply astound.  Conceptual drawings such as &quot;How protons decay&quot; are also found in abundance.<br />Tyson, Liu, and Irion introduce readers to 'the' golden age of astronomy (Right here.  Right now) and explain the principles that govern our everyday lives, as well as the workings of the cosmos.  That's quite a lot to accomplish in a book that is also a visual feast (400 full-color illustrations).  However, the authors are well-suited to tackle the job. Neil de Grasse Tyson is the Frederick P. Rose Director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History.  Charles Liu is an astrophysicist at the Museum.  Robert Irion is a free-lance journalist, and a contributing editor and correspondent to Astronomy and Science.<br /><br />Using everyday analogies (as opposed to mathematical formulae), the authors take us on a journey through our universe, from the infinitesimal to the infinite.  Here is an example illustrating Newton's second law of motion:<br />&quot;Imagine standing behind two people wearing roller skates.  One is a 90-pound ballerina, and the other is a sumo wrestler who weighs five times as much.  If you push on each person with equal force (and tact), you will accelerate the ballerina five times more quickly.  That ratio holds true in space as well.&quot;<br />&quot;One Universe&quot; includes an illustrated timeline of the major advances in astronomy and physics, from Democritus to Hale-Bopp.	2002-11-19

If you're the type of person who worries about being struck by lightning while reading the wrong kind of book, stay away from &quot;Small Gods.&quot;  Terry Pratchett blasphemes against (or maybe I should say 'explains') religion in this book, and most philosophies too.  This is one of his more seriously comic Discworld books, although only Pratchett (and Monty Python) would even consider an attempt at a comedy about the Grand Inquisition<br />If Galileo had muttered, &quot;Eppur si muove!&quot; to the Inquisition on Discworld, he no doubt would have been referring to the gigantic turtle that carries the world on its back.  He would have burned too, old as he was, if Vorbis the exquisitor had overheard him blaspheming against the perfect sphere of Discworld, which orbits around the Sun &quot;as Man orbits the central truth of Om.&quot;<br />Meanwhile Om scrabbles out of the compost heap and discovers Brutha, a young novice who is hoeing melons in the temple garden.  Brutha is the only person left on Discworld who truly believes in Om, and really bad things happen to gods who lose all of their believers.<br />However, Brutha almost loses his god. Vorbis the exquisitor discovers the small tortoise hissing at him and doesn't recognize it as his God, Om.  He flips it over, inserts a couple of pebbles into its shell so it can't right itself, then sticks Om on the garden wall to broil in the sun.<br />Vorbis is a bad 'un.<br />After this temporary setback (setback, get it?), &quot;Small Gods&quot; carries on with the tale of Om and Brutha and their adventures as Om tries to figure out why he ended up as a tortoise, and Brutha attempts to discover truth in religion.  This book is a work of fiction.  All the characters and events portrayed in this book are fictional, and any resemblance to real people or incidents is purely coincidental.  However if you read very carefully, you may spot coincidental resemblances to Tom&aacute;s de Torquemada, Jesus, any number of classical Greek philosophers, early Christian saints, Old Testament prophets, and Galileo Galilei.spot coincidental resemblances to Tomás de Torquemada, Jesus, any number of classical Greek philosophers, early Christian saints, Old Testament prophets, and Galileo Galilei.	2002-11-13

These aren't the stodgy (but wonderful) free traders of her 'Solar Queen' series.  The crewmates of the starship 'Lydis' are edgy, shape-shifted mutants with extra-sensory powers.  Krip Vorlund, one of the first-person narrators was once human, but got relocated into an alien Thassa body in &quot;Moon of Three Rings.&quot;  He couldn't go home again, so to speak, because his original body was spaced.  The second narrator, the Moon Singer herself (who switched Krip then got switched herself) inhabits a sort of large-clawed, dog shape in 'Exiles,' but retains her intelligence and at least some of her esper powers.<br />The Forerunner theme weaves into the mix when the 'Lydis' sets down on the planet, Thoth in the Amen-Re system, which happens to be particularly rich in Forerunner artifacts.  'Lydis's officers seal a bargain with Thothian priests to transport some of the alien treasure to the planet Ptah for safekeeping (Thoth is in the midst of a nasty civil war).  So far so good.  But shortly after lift-off from Thoth, the 'Lydis' has to make an emergency landing on the uninhabited planet, Sekhmet.<br />Almost as soon as she touches down, the 'Lydis' comes under attack.<br />Krip Vorlund and the former Moon Singer, Maelen set out on a rescue mission through the ancient, underground ways of Sekhmet, where they encounter jackers (space pirates), Patrolmen, ghosts from their own past, and yet more Forerunner super-technology.<br />The Moon Singer books are not my favorite Nortons.  They are a thematic hodge-podge, and it's hard to love a hero and heroine who inhabit non-cuddly alien bodies with super-human powers.  However, if you are already a Norton fan and are particularly fond of her Forerunner novels (I think the very first one was the 'Solar Queen' adventure, &quot;Sargasso of Space&quot;), read &quot;Exiles of the Stars&quot;--but only after you've finished &quot;Moon of Three Rings.&quot;ready a Norton fan and are particularly fond of her Forerunner novels (I think the very first one was the 'Solar Queen' adventure, &quot;Sargasso of Space&quot;), read &quot;Exiles of the Stars&quot;--but only after you've finished &quot;Moon of Three Rings.&quot;	2002-11-11

Like \\"Year of the Unicorn,\\" 'Gryphon' takes place in the Dales and wastelands of High Hallack, as opposed to Norton's original Witch World settings of Estcarp and Escore, where Simon Tregarth and his family did battle with out-worlders and evil magic.<br />The story alternates between Kerovan, lord-heir in Ulmsdale of High Hallack, and Joisan, high-born maid of Ithkrypt in Ithdale of High Hallack, who is wedded to Kerovan by proxy when she is only eight.  At first, there are few changes to her life as she will remain with her own kin until of suitable age:<br />....<br />It is so easy to get caught up in Norton's fantasy world.  She puts her reader right into the midst of the feasting, mayhem, and magic.  It's almost like being set down into the midst of a medieval Book of Hours.<br />Speaking of magic, when Kerovan's mother was about to give birth to him, she was forced to take shelter in a ruin of the mysterious Old Ones.  She was rumored to be of the Old Race herself, and Kerovan was born with hooves instead of normal, human feet.  His eyes were the color of butter amber.<br />Kerovan and Joisan grow up separately, having never met although they are married, and then their world is torn asunder by a strange invasion from the sea (see the original Witch World cycle for more detail about these invaders and their crawling, flame-shooting machines).  In the Year of the Moss Wife, when Joisan should have gone to Ulmsdale to take up her wifely duties, she instead learns how to wear mail and wield a light sword.  She wears a tiny gryphon in a crystal globe under her mail--a gift from her unknown fianc&eacute;.<br />Meanwhile Kerovan has problems of his own.  The keep at Ulmsdale is betrayed to the invaders and he must make his way across the war-torn Dales to Joisan, whose own home has been destroyed.  When he finally finds her, she mistakes him for one of the mysterious Old Ones because of his physical peculiarities.<br />How Kerovan and Joisan gradually come to regard each other, and how they attempt to defeat the dark magic that is arrayed against them forms the main story-line of this wonderful, but incomplete fantasy.<br />There are two sequels to \\"The Crystal Gryphon\\" (1972): \\"Gryphon in Glory\\" (1981); and \\"Gryphon's Eyrie\\" (1984, written with A. C. Crispin).  None of Norton's co-authored books are as good as the ones she wrote by herself, but this is a series that is well worth following to the end.royed.

It is an elegant, erudite tour of the City of Light, through its streets and through its history.<br />I first read \\"Paris\\" in a small garret under the eaves of a grand Parisian hotel.  It had been one of the hottest days on record and my room had no air-conditioning.  Nor does Paris shut down for the night.  However, I had an imposing view of a street, lined with facades of a \\"huge blank pompous featureless sameness\\" that was deplored by Henry James.  And I had this book, which turned that airless Parisian night into magic.  Its author has a knack for spotting the most telling detail--from the \\"heavy, gun-metaled print of a mid-nineteenth-century thumb\\" where he starts his tour in the Louvre, to the very borders of Ile de France where he ultimately bids his readers farewell under the \\"immensities of the upper air\\" that were a painter's dream.  \\"Light, then, first: and air.\\"<br />In many aspects of their lives, John Russell finds Parisians to be \\"a secretive, devious, ungiving people.\\"  Buildings are there to hide things, not expose them to every passing tourist.  However, this book puts all of the charming (and not so charming) details of interior life on view.  There are the velvet-lined elevators of the original Galeries Lafayette, whose builder's passion \\"was to conquer the female race\\"--in the shopping sense of 'conquer.'  There are Anglophile pubs, and expensive 'bars-&agrave;-filles,' where \\"the lights glow rose-to-amber, the windows are curtained with carpet, ...a sad bargain can be driven at any hour of the day, and the atmosphere is inexpugnably 'triste'.\\"<br />One of my favorite descriptions is of Balzac's house on the street that now bears his name.  Like so many other Parisians, the nineteenth-century author succumbed to the contagion of High Victorian style.  Hardly a surface in the house was left unsculpted or unencrusted with bronze, tortoiseshell, and buttercup damask.  The bathroom was built of yellow stone and covered with bas-reliefs in stucco.  Once shut inside Balzac's library, a stranger might never find her way out again, because even the door was lined with bookshelves.<br />The author is equally at home in every Parisian milieu, from palace to 'bar-&agrave;-fille.'  As Rosamond Bernier says in her introduction to this book, \\"No one else could combine the feel and the look, the heart and the mind, the stones and the trees, the past and the present, the wits, the eccentrics, and the geniuses of my favorite city with such easy grace.\\"<br />\\"Paris\\" is adorned with 310 illustrations (many of them charming old photographs), including 85 colored plates, all personally chosen by John Russell.<br />If a trip to Paris is even the merest glimmer on your event horizon, read this book.

James's supernatural works	Ghost-story fans will buy this book, no matter how steep the price, because it contains all of Montague Rhodes James's ghost stories, both finished and unfinished, his fantasy novella \\"The Five Jars,\\" his parody of \\"Doctor Faustus,\\" all of his commentary on ghostly literature, and much, much more.  I shelled out the big bucks when \\"A Pleasing Terror\\" was first published by Ash-Tree Press (August, 2001), not because I cared about first editions, but because I had to have this book.  It's the only complete collection of Monty's supernatural fiction.<br />All of the stories are heavily annotated.  The Latin tags and obscure scholarly references that pepper Monty's writings are explained for the non-classically-educated reader (most of us I should guess.)  And his stories reverberate with his own special brand of horror--a muffled scratching within the tomb--not the gothic bombast of a Poe, or the eyeball-stomping aggression of a Stephen King.  The scene in \\"Count Magnus\\" where the last padlock falls from the medieval coffin, or the cobwebby face that peers over the assistant librarian's shoulder as he reads from \\"The Tractate Middoth\\" are typical Jamesian touches.  This Edwardian Prevost of King's College, Cambridge specialized in antiquarian settings, and scholarly heroes who open the wrong book or peer into the wrong sarcophagus.<br />Some of the most interesting tidbits for M.R. James fanatics can be found in the multiple appendixes to \\"A Pleasing Terror.\\"  Those of us who were lucky enough to subscribe to Rosemary Pardoe's \\"Ghosts and Scholars\\" (a journal devoted to M.R. James and his imitators) before it ceased publication after thirty-three editions, will recognize her contributions, most especially in Appendix I:  \\"James Wilson's Secret,\\" and Appendix II:  \\"The Black Pilgrimage.\\"<br />If this is not enough to satiate true M. R. James addicts, \\"A Memoir of Montague Rhodes James\\" by S. G. Lubbock is also included, as is a selected bibliography, and Rosemary Pardoe's \\"M.R. James on TV, Radio, and Film.\\"  I've never seen or heard any of the dramatizations of his stories, as most of them were done in England, but \\"Night of the Demons (1958)\\" whose screenplay was 'adapted' from Monty's \\"Casting the Runes\\" might have worked its way onto video by now.<br />Monty fans, \\"A Pleasing Terror\\" is 'the' big kahuna.

Crusty old Professor Childermass (a series regular) vanishes early on, to be replaced by crusty old Irish-American priest, Father Higgins, who brandishes a silver crucifix and rescues Johnny in the nick of some very frightening situations.<br />Johnny is a shy, likeable boy who tries to act brave in spite of thinking himself a coward.  His lower lip quivers almost continuously as he and his friend Fergie set out to find the missing professor.  (He has every reason to be nervous in a story that reminds me of \\"The Haunted Doll's House\\" by that master of horror himself: M. R. James).  For reasons that remain a mystery until the last few pages, our youthful hero is plagued by a tiny human skull and an ominous jack-o-lantern after his friend, Professor Childermass disappears.<br />As skeletons, demons, and a haunted clock all conspire to make Johnny's life miserable, Fergie and Father Higgins pitch in to help him.  The climax to \\"The Spell of the Sorcerer's Skull\\" takes place on a remote rock off the coast of Maine, appropriately named 'Cemetery Island.'<br />The book is set in the nostalgic early 1950s (Johnny's father is a fighter pilot in Korea), but you won't have much time to feel nostalgia.  You'll be too busy feeling scared.  One of the reliable features of John Bellairs's adolescent fiction is that he doesn't try to make his ghosts cuddly or mawkish, like so many so-called 'teen-age horror' authors.	2002-11-02

If you're interested in Victoriana or folk art, &quot;First Steps in Stenciling&quot; will explain a simple decorative technique that was in extensive use during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  One interesting area that the author does not cover is Islamic stenciling, but the techniques would be similar.<br />There are many web sites devoted to selling pre-cut stencils, but with this book you can trace and cut out your own.  You can also photocopy a desired image and enlarge or shrink it to the right size.<br />One word of caution:  try to find stencil paper or acetate at an art supply store and don't attempt to use cardboard like I did.  You will be rewarded with crisper, cleaner edges.<br />It's up to you what paint you use (the author strongly recommends acrylic paint) for the stencil, but it is easier to apply using a baby roller with all of the strokes going in one direction.  The author suggests using stipple brushes, a different brush for each color.  You might want to try both techniques, depending on the surface you're stenciling.<br />Other supplies include an X-acto craft knife with extra packages of blades, tracing paper, a container for mixing paint, masking tape, pencils or fine markers, a straight-edge, a good cutting surface, and something to wipe away your mistakes (old tee-shirts work well for this).<br />There are detailed instructions for each of the projects in this book, including spice racks, flower pots, pillows, holiday table settings, Christmas cards, and curtains.  The author has a very clear, easy-to-understand style and most of her stencils are uncomplicated and easy to cut.	2002-10-27

And sometimes a little voice inside of you said, \\"My hands already look clean.\\"  And you didn't bother to wash them?<br />You might not think it worthwhile to read a book that nags you on this very same subject, especially if you are a physician or hospital care worker.  But, as this author points out, hospital-acquired infections are among the biggest public health threats in America and they're on the rise. The often drug-resistant germs kill more than twice as many people as traffic accidents (in fact, these infections kill more people per year than all accidental deaths including car crashes, fires, burns, falls, etc.) and cost an estimated $4.5 billion a year.<br />Those are astonishing statistics--something to be expected from a medieval pest hole, not a modern hospital.<br />Just yesterday (10/25/2002), the government issued guidelines urging doctors and nurses to abandon the ritual of washing their hands with soap and water between patients, and instead rub on fast-drying alcohol gels to kill more germs.  The author of \\"The Secret Life of Germs\\" also favors germicides over simple soap and water.  He's done his research and does not feel that germs will develop resistance to these products, because they do not kill selectively like antibiotics do.<br />Be sure to read the section on \\"The (Not So) Sweet Smell of Human Flora.\\"  You might be surprised by some of the causes of chronic bad breath---and the remedies (chew a wad a parsley or celery seed after eating garlic).<br />In fact this book recommends protective response strategies for almost all of those times when you might find yourself in a germ-laden environment.  After hospitals, public restrooms are the scariest (yes, your mother was right about them, too).  The author recommends specific techniques for washing your hands before and after using public facilities.  Unfortunately, another one of his protective response strategies--close the lid of the seat before flushing--can't be implemented in a restroom stall, because there are no lids.  This is a problem because \\"flushing the toilet can send small drops of aerosolized fecal matter as far as twenty feet into the air.\\"<br />The least you can do is close the lid at home, especially if your toothbrush happens to be stored in the open, less than twenty feet away from your toilet.<br />The sections on pets, fast food, municipal water supplies and leftovers are also grim.  Did you know that the bacterium 'Listeria monocytogenes,' the cause of listeriosis food poisoning, resists freezing and actually thrives at normal refrigeration temperatures?  The author has a list of nineteen protective response strategies for eating and drinking.  You really should check them out, especially if you are fond of fast foods, are giving or attending a party where food is served buffet-style, or are immuno-suppressed.<br />\\"The Secret Life of Germs\\" is not a fun book, but it is essential reading for those of us who are concerned about our health or the health of others (Saddam Hussein is actually practicing good hygiene when he makes people scrub up before shaking hands with him).sponse strategies--close the lid of the seat before flushing--can't be implemented in a restroom stall, because there are no lids.

Whereas the latter volume describes the harem from the point of view of the Sultan, this book describes it from the point of view of the women.  The author herself lived in Turkey, in an old building that was once the harem of a pasha.  Her paternal grandmother, Zehra, lived in a harem until 1909 when the institution was abolished and declared unlawful after the fall of Abdulhamid, the last Osmanli Sultan.<br />\\"Harem\\" is lavishly illustrated with photographs, Turkish woodcuts, and Persian miniatures of tastefully clad ladies within their private world.  There are also paintings of what European artists imagined (for the most part) the interior of a Turkish bath or seraglio might look like.  \\"La grand Odalisque\\" by Ingres adorns the cover and G&eacute;rôme, Delacroix, Renoir, and John Frederick Lewis are among other European artists whose paintings embellish these pages.<br />The details of everyday life in a wealthy sultan's harem (the author focuses on the Seraglio of Topkapi Palace in Istanbul) stuns the reader's senses.  Dinners were set on velvet cloths embroidered with silver.  The napkin rings were mother-of-pearl set with diamonds.  The sherbet might have been concocted from the essence of violets or roses, as well as more commonplace fruit juices.<br />And the clothing!  Veils of sheerest muslin, tasseled caps of velvet embroidered with pearls, trousers of Bursa silk, vests and girdles encrusted in precious stones.  European males may have fantasized about the state of undress in a harem (as witnessed by their paintings), but their wives and daughters--those who were fortunate enough to actually visit a harem--wrote home about the intricate and beautiful costumes.  Even the color of a lady's handkerchief could convey an unspoken message, rather like the Victorian Language of Flowers.  Red signified passionate love.  Purple meant 'suffering from love.'  A torn, burned handkerchief signaled that its owner was dying of heartache.<br />Wives, concubines, and female relatives were not the only inhabitants of a rich man's harem.  There were also the eunuchs.  The author goes into quite a bit of detail (as she does with everything in this wonderful book) about the different types of eunuchs and how they were created.  Male readers might even want to skip this chapter since it involves verbs like 'bruising and crushing,' 'dragging,' 'twisting,' and 'searing.'  A prepubescent boy had the best chance of surviving the various operations.<br />Eunuchs were also employed by the holy mosques in Mecca and Medina, as attendants for the female worshippers.<br />One of the questions most frequently asked of the author is whether harems still exist, and in the last section of her book, \\"Harems Today,\\" she answers, \\"yes, they do.\\"  The only disappointment in this otherwise fantastic and opulent history is that Alev Lytle Croutier was not able to include a photograph of a modern harem.

Regardless of whether her works are intended for adults or for children, they often contain hair-raising adventures that alternate (somewhat oddly, in my opinion) with lighthearted romps.<br />I was uncomfortable with the mixture of comedy and terror in \\"The Whispering Mountain,\\" a young adult fantasy that takes place in a land resembling eighteenth century Wales.  The young hero, Owen Hughes lives with his strict, grumpy grandfather in the small town of Pennygaff.  He is on his way home from the Jones Academy for the Sons of Gentlemen and Respectable Tradesman one cold, rainy evening when he is ambushed by the local bullies.<br />Two gypsies, father and daughter save Owen and take him home to his grandfather.  'Home' also happens to be a museum of curious artifacts, including an old harp.<br />Grandfather chases the gypsies off of his property then goes to a meeting, leaving his grandson to guard the museum and its ancient harp.  Normally Owen doesn't mind staying in the museum, but tonight his encounter with the bullies has made him nervous.  Nevertheless, he falls asleep.  He doesn't wake up until two rough strangers, speaking London thieves' cant, break into the one-room museum.<br />(It was hard for me to understand what the thieves were talking about, even though I've read a zillion Regency romances, including the complete works of Georgette Heyer--and one or two of the gothics by Joan Aiken.  What does it mean when a character says, \\"Get a bit o' prog while you're at it,\\" or \\"...I say that won't happen till Turpentine Sunday, and meanwhile it makes a famous ken, dunnit?\\"  Other characters occasionally lapse into Cymric, so this book isn't a quick read).<br />At any rate, the two strangers steal the harp and kidnap Owen to make it appear as though he absconded with the harp.  The thieves plan to 'finish off the young co' and 'hugger' his body away in one of the region's many caves.<br />The quest to recover the stolen harp and return it to its true master takes up the rest of the story.<br />The one element that dissipated the excitement of the quest for me, was the author's introduction of farcical characters or scenes, just as Owen was about to get \\"five inches of steel in his breadbasket,\\" or was chasing the mad dwarf, Abipaal through the heart of the mountain, or was trapped in a dungeon filled with hungry tiger-snakes, or--<br />What I'm trying to say is that it detracted from the tension of the story when some oddball character bumbled and babbled into Owen's cliff-hanger, or the tiger-snakes turned out to be sweeties, or the villains got drunk and bawled out ballads like: \\"Hey-diddle-diddle, my merry men,/ Let's all go to the bousing-ken.\\"make it appear as though he absconded with the harp.

James, and the Marx Brothers.\\"<br />\\"The Moving Toyshop,\\" published in 1946, was Crispin's third Gervase Fen mystery.  This particular whodunit involves an unusual will, a hunt for five eccentric characters named after the nonsense poems of Edward Lear, and of course, a moving toy shop with a corpse in its upper story.  The action begins in the Autumn of 1938, when the poet, Richard Cadogan wangles an advance from his London publisher and sets out for a vacation in Oxford.<br />The reader begins to realize the oddity of the journey he has embarked upon with the poet, when Cadogan hitches a ride with truck driver who quotes Coleridge (\\"a thahsand, thahsand slimy things lived on and so did I.\\") but prefers D.H. Lawrence's \\"Lady Somebody's Lover.\\"<br />We're entering Fen Country now, where even the truck drivers and police detectives are amateur literary critics, and our detective, Gervase Fen is the Oxford don of English Language and Literature.  Dialogue fizzes with cynical witticisms and literary allusions when Fen and the poet, Cadogan go at it, or when Fen takes on any of a number of amateur classicists who populate \\"The Moving Toyshop.\\"<br />All of Crispin's Fen mysteries can be read with pleasure for the dialogue alone.  This particular book also has a full cast of British eccentrics, including the five Edward Lear characters (one of whom is a murderer).<br />Here is your first limerick-clue:<br />\\"There was an Old Person of Mold who shrank from sensations of Cold; so he purchased some muffs, some furs, and some fluffs, and wrapped himself up from the cold.\\"<br />Racket through the streets (and sometimes the lawns) of Oxford in Fen's battered, red roadster, Lily Christine III!

So-so goddess	\\"Goddess by Mistake\\" is really an R-rated romance with a fantasy overlay.  The heroine, Shannon Parker is a high school English teacher who gets transferred to an alternate world where she is mistaken for the Voice of the Goddess Epona.  She is forced into a ritual marriage with the centaur, ClanFintan (yes, a Celtic centaur) and together they set out to save their people from an immense horde of bat-winged vampire-demons who like to schlurp the blood of, and impregnate human women.  (The scene where a woman gives birth to a vampire is a real gross-out.)<br />Shannon-Rhiannon (S-R) is a feisty heroine and her interior monologues are wickedly amusing.  My only problem with her is that she is constantly ogling her scantily-clad guardsmen and her centaur-husband, who is (according to S-R) hung like a--well, he is half horse.  S-R spends way too much time dressing, undressing, taking baths, picking out jewelry, panting after various males, and riding, umm, bareback.  Her character too often lapses into one-dimensional vaudeville:  a sort of 'broad' Benny Hill patter-routine (leer,  leer.  Snort.)<br />That one quibble aside, P.C. Cast writes like a dream and the school-teacher-turned-priestess's commentary on her new world is appealingly (and sometimes grossly) funny.  There's not much of a plot in &quot;Goddess by Mistake,&quot; but the zaftig dialogue will make you snort up your soda pop through your nose.	2002-09-27

If you are new to this author, I suggest you start with one of his full-length mysteries to get the full flavor of his sometimes cranky, always brilliant amateur detective, Gervase Fen.<br />The best of the \\"Fen Country\\" stories feature Professor Fen with Chief Inspector Humbleby of New Scotland Yard as his Watson.  Some of the mysteries feature different, anonymous detectives and these stories tend to be clever puzzles with only the barest accouterments of character development or setting.<br />There is one semi-autobiographical, wish-fulfillment story, \\"We Know You're Busy Writing, but We Thought You Wouldn't Mind if We Just Dropped in for a Minute.\\"<br />\\"I am forty-seven, unmarried, living alone, a minor crime-fiction writer earning, on average, rather less than 1,000 [pounds] a year.\\"<br />The crime writer lives alone in Devon, and has begged his friends and creditors not to interrupt him during working hours.  Naturally they do, including a man and woman on the lam from their respective spouses.  There is no great mystery as to the fate of the lovers, only a great deal of authorly glee.<br />\\"Fen Country\\" is a good read for Crispin fans, but \\"Beware of the Trains,\\" whose stories he personally collected is better.  Neither short story collection transcends the genre of `brilliant, eccentric detective' fiction like his novels do.  If you are an avid reader of  Allingham, Sayers, or Innes from the Golden Age of British mystery writing, try Crispin's \\"Buried for Pleasure,\\" \\"The Long Divorce,\\" or \\"Love Lies Bleeding.\\"  You might even be tempted to put Professor Fen at the top of your great detectives list, ahead of the likes of Lord Peter, Sir John Appleby, and Mr. Campion.	2002-09-27

Witness the parasite Sacculina that turns crabs into zombies--the slug-like female enters the crab through a convenient leg joint and gradually fills its whole body cavity, even wrapping roots around its host's eyestalks.  The crab continues its shadow-crab life, sidling through the surf, eating mussels and clams.  However, it stops moulting and growing as these activities would funnel energy away from Sacculina.  If the parasite becomes pregnant, it doesn't matter whether the crab started out as male or female--it will brood and hatch the next generation of Sacculina as if the tiny larvae were its own children.<br />Sacculina's life-style is rather hard on the crab, but it is only one of the amazingly efficient (and bizarre) parasites described in this book.  Other parasites have adopted Sacculina's method of eliminating their host's unnecessary functions such as reproduction (unnecessary to the parasite, that is) while leaving the host enough brain, nervous system, and digestive tract to go on feeding.<br />I imagine if there were a Sacculina-type parasite for humans, we would soon lose our urge to play football or go swimming.  We would lie in front of the TV all day long, stuffing ourselves with---wait a minute, here!  Is it possible...?<br />Zimmer also describes the stratagems that potential hosts have evolved to eliminate, or at least confuse the parasites that view them as mobile homes with well-stocked refrigerators:<br />\\"Consider the leaf-rolling caterpillars.  They're pretty ordinary insect larvae with one exception:  they fire their droppings like howitzers...What on Earth could have driven the evolution of an anal cannon?  Parasites could.  When parasitic wasps home in on a larva such as the leaf-roller caterpillar, one of the best clues is the odor of their host's droppings...The intense pressure put on leaf-roller caterpillars by [parasitic] wasps has pushed the evolution of high-pressure fecal firing.

However, she does occasionally reveal a playful side to her husband.<br />At the beginning of \\"A Connoiseur's Case,\\" the reader finds Sir John and his wife strolling along a disused canal, one fine English summer day.  They indulge in affectionately ironic conversation, making it obvious that theirs is a long-standing marriage (although as I remember, they also talked that way to each other before marriage---see \\"Appleby's End\\"):<br />Lady Judith:  \\"It's private enough.

Lovecraft seems to have spawned a particularly virulent strain of the latter.  However one of its subgenres, i.e. the ghost story seems to attract a better quality of writer--perhaps because a truly frightening tale of the returned dead is so difficult to write.<br /> (Believe me, I've tried and after almost half a century of trying, have sold exactly one ghost story).<br />L. P. Hartley, who wrote \\"The Travelling Grave\\" and other great stories of the supernatural, described the ghost story as \\"certainly the most exacting form of literary art, and perhaps the only one in which there is almost no intermediate step between success and failure.  Either it comes off or it is a flop.\\"<br />Cox and Gilbert have collected mostly successes (and one or two flops) in \\"The Oxford Book of English Ghost Stories\\" and its companion volume, \\"The Oxford Book of Victorian Ghost Stories.\\"  If you suffer from what Virginia Woolf called \\"the strange human craving for the pleasure of feeling afraid,\\" both of these volumes will satisfy. Each contains a good mix of familiar and lesser-known ghost stories.<br />Here is a sampling from 'English Ghost Stories':<br />\\"The Monkey's Paw\\" by W.W. Jacobs -- A horrible variant on 'Be careful what you wish for.  It might just come true.'

Their friend, Grace Martineau is dying of cancer and she wants her friends about her one last time.<br />This particular Appleby is mostly dialogue.  Almost all of the action (several deaths, drug dealing, statutory rape) takes place off stage.  Innes paints very believable psychological portraits of his protagonists, a talent that may have been strengthened by the year he spent in Vienna, studying Freudian psychology.  The characters' interactions tend to be both erudite and revealing, as in this mystery's opening scene when the guests have gathered in the loggia at dusk to hear a nightingale sing:<br />\\"'O Nightingale, that on yon bloomy Spray/ Warbl'st at eve, and when all the woods are still.'<br />\\"This was Bobby again, and it ought to have been harmless and agreeable.  But it wasn't, Appleby thought--or not quite.  Grace Martineau could be sensed as stiffening in displeasure as if she felt Bobby--her husband's nephew--to be guying this new poem, and so guying the bird.  And it was quite possible--one suddenly perceived--that Grace didn't much like Bobby, anyway.<br />\\"And Diana Page, too, seemed not pleased, for she launched another attack on the young man.<br />\\"'Fancy spouting poetry about the nightingale,' she said, 'when one can sit still and listen to it!\\"<br />The deaths don't take place until the latter half of the mystery.  Meanwhile the reader becomes well-acquainted with Grace Martineau and her machinations to have her husband remarry after she has died.  Her guests, already on edge because they know this is the last time they will see their hostess, are shocked by her insistence that her husband should wed another after her passing.  They are even more shocked when they learn Grace's choice of bride.<br />\\"The Bloody Wood\\" is a somber Appleby, almost more tragedy than mystery.  Nevertheless it is a good mystery, where the reader is challenged to discover a killer, after the author has furnished revealing psychological portraits of the murder suspects.e reader is challenged to discover a killer, after the author has furnished revealing psychological portraits of the murder suspects.	2002-09-08

He was educated at Oriel College, Oxford, and his mysteries reflect both his scholarship, and the year he spent in Vienna, studying Freudian psychoanalysis.<br />\\"A Private View\\" (1952), also titled \\"One Man Show\\" is later Appleby.  Sir John has already been knighted and married, and has worked his way up to the position of Assistant Commissioner at New Scotland Yard.  He and his wife, Lady Judith (a sculptress by profession) play equal roles in solving the double mystery of who murdered the young artist, Gavin Limbert, and who stole two very famous paintings from the Duke of Horton's estate.  (The Duke also plays a prominent role in the early Appleby mystery,  \\"Hamlet, Revenge!\\" (1937).)<br />This story begins when Lady Judith drags her unsuspecting husband off to a memorial exhibition of the works of Gavin Limbert, a young artist who was thought to have committed suicide.  When Limbert's `chef d'oeuvre' is stolen from the gallery, right under Appleby's nose, he feels compelled to reopen the case on the painter's mysterious demise.<br />Appleby's assistant, Inspector Cadover is already acquainted with the case and he serves as a stiff upper-lip to his chief's intuitive, sometimes playful method of investigation.  When Appleby disappears after a nocturnal ruckus in a junk shop, Cadover takes over the case and brings it to a successful conclusion---just as he later takes on Appleby's role at New Scotland Yard after Sir John's retirement (for more about Cadover, read \\"The Case of the Journeying Boy\\" by Michael Innes (1949).)<br />This particular Appleby is an equal mixture of mystery and adventure---Appleby personally engages the villains in glorious, but somewhat ignominious battle; Judith hides in a closet and overhears an artist plotting murder, etc.  There is a wonderful chase scene that ends when Lady Judith and the Duke of Horton save Appleby from a particularly appalling fate.<br />Don't let the author's gift for playful, erudite dialogue disguise his mastery of character.  \\"A Private View\\" contains a portrait of an amnesiac young woman that is probably the most sensitive and believable in all of mystery literature (eat your heart out, Dame Agatha!)appalling fate.<br />Don't let the author's gift for playful, erudite dialogue disguise his mastery of character.  \\"A Private View\\" contains a portrait of an amnesiac young woman that is probably the most sensitive and believable in all of mystery literature (eat your heart out, Dame Agatha!)	2002-09-08

(Inspector Appleby)	Books	5	14	14	N	Y	Age cannot wither these characters	This classical suspense novel, first published in 1937 might be difficult to follow for readers who are not already familiar with Shakespeare''s '&#34;The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince Denmark.'&#34;<br />However, it is well worth reading, not only for the richly allusive mystery, but also for the characters who create and act out its tragedy.  The author engraves his brittle, upper-class English in diamond-point prose.  He etches their wit with acid.  They are never dull.  To misquote the Bard himself, 'Age cannot wither Innes's characters, nor murder stale their witty dialogue.'<br /><br />For the length of the tragedy at least, the reader will inhabit the manor and precincts of Scamnum Court, principal seat of the Duke of Horton---'It is a big place: two counties away it has a sort of little brother in Blenheim Palace.'<br /><br />After the second murder of the evening, C.I.D. Inspector John Appleby gives the reader his impression of the place, while searching through its corridors for the Duchess of Horton:<br /><br />'&#34;Moving about Scamnum at night, it seemed to Appleby, was like moving in a dream through some monstrously overgrown issue of 'Country Life.'  Great cubes of space, disconcertingly indeterminate in function--- were they rooms or passages? ---flowed past in the half-darkness with the intermittent coherence of distant music, now composed into order and proportion, now a vague and raw material for the architectonics of the imagination'He recalled the great palaces --- now for the most part tenantless --- which the eighteenth century had seen rise, all weirdly of a piece, about Europe.  Scamnum, he knew, was to be a different pattern; would reveal itself in the morning as being --- however augustly --- the home of an English gentleman and a familiar being.  But now it was less a human dwelling than a dream-symbol of centuries of rule, a fantasy created from the tribute of ten thousand cottages long perished from the land.&#34;<br />'<br />Everything in &#34;'Hamlet, Revenge!&#34;' is done on a grand scale.  The Duchess of Horton persuades her old friend, the Lord Chancellor of England to act the part of Polonius in her amateur production of 'Hamlet.'  Her husband is cast as Claudius, King of Denmark and she herself plays his Queen.  Their daughter, Elizabeth is Ophelia.  The greatest Shakespearean actor of the day plays the Melancholy Dane.<br />All of the play's characters are put on edge by a series of mysterious messages, culminating in a quotation from 'Macbeth', '''there shall be done a deed of dreadful note'''  Then the Lord Chancellor is shot to death at the very instant in the play when his character is supposed to die by Hamlet's sword.<br /><br />Appleby is called in to solve a murder that 'was planned, deliberately and at obvious risk, to take place bang in the middle of a private performance of Hamlet.'<br /><br />The young C.I.D. Inspector is also charged with recovering vital State documents that the second-most important figure in British government had with him when he motored down to Scamnum Court to strut and fret upon the ducal stage.  Until the very end of' 'Hamlet, Revenge'!' the reader can never be sure if he or she is reading a murder mystery or a spy story.<br /><br />''Hamlet, Revenge!'' in my opinion is one of the top ten mysteries of the last century, reaching the same rarified heights as Sayers's ''The Nine Taylors'.'<br /><br />It is much less known to American readers, possibly because of its author's richly allusive style.

A peacock, badgers, and diamonds are indeed featured in this British manor house mystery, along with Sir John Appleby, now retired from his high position at New Scotland Yard.<br />As this elegant story begins, an antediluvian Chief Constable, Colonel Pride (late of His British Majesty's Indian Army) is driving Sir John over to meet his neighbors at Elvedon Court.  Sir John was New Scotland Yard's acknowledged authority on art-robberies, and the manor's owner has suffered a recent theft:<br />&quot;'Grove nods at grove' -- Sir John Appleby quoted -- 'each alley has a brother--'<br />&quot;What's that, my dear fellow?&quot; Colonel Pride, who had drawn up his car on the Palladian bridge for a preliminary view of Elvedon Court, glanced at his companion with every appearance of perplexity.<br />&quot;'And half the platform just reflects the other.'<br />&quot;Ah, a bit of poetry.&quot; Pride nodded.  He was seemingly gratified at having got, as he would have expressed it, right on the ball.  &quot;And I see what the chap means.  All a bit formal, I agree.  What another of those long-haired characters calls fearful symmetry.&quot;<br />The layout of Elvedon Court plays an important role in the ensuing mystery, so it behooves you to pay attention when the author is discussing its architecture.<br />No sooner do Colonel Pride and Sir John pull up next to the stately flight of steps leading to the manor's entrance, than they spot a police van.<br />Someone has murdered their host, Maurice Tytherton.<br />Almost everyone at Elvedon Court is a suspect, including a shifty butler and his wife, a known art thief, the late owner's mistress and her husband, a sniveling nephew with financial problems, and a prying guest who may remind you of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple.  Sir John insinuates himself amongst the guests and relatives of the deceased and has a splendid time smashing alibis and detecting motives.  There are lots of red herrings to chase after--for instance a vicar who lurks about the distinguished grounds with a pair of binoculars--but when Sir John finally rounds up all of the suspects into the deceased's study for the grand denouement, you may be sure he will finger the actual murderer.  After all, &quot;Appleby's Other Story&quot; is from the Golden Age of British Mystery--the genre's Age of Enlightenment, as practiced by authors such as Dorothy Sayers, Edmund Crispin, Margaret Allingham, and of course, J.I.M.

All of his mysteries contain eccentricities: usually a farcical character or a setting that is just out of true.  In this particular mystery, characters, plot, and setting are all seen through a glass, cross-eyed.<br />However, if you can swallow the premise that an obscenely wealthy individual is stealing paranormal objects (including a counting horse, a witch, and a haunted house) with the goal of cornering the market on the supernatural, then founding a new religion and ruling the world after the current dust-up (WWII) is ended, you'll enjoy this story.  It has a Grand Guignol climax on the banks of the mighty Amazon River, that includes not only the cab horse, the witch, and the haunted house, but also the phosphorescing ghost of a murdered man.<br />It also has the strangest motive for murder in all of fiction.<br />Inspector Appleby is drawn into the Daffodil affair when a cab horse of that name goes missing in wartime London.  Daffodil happens to be the favorite 'ride' of Appleby's elderly maiden aunt.  Not only is he a gentle, slow-moving steed, he can also answer numerical queries by bobbing his head the requisite number of times, in the manner of the psychic horse, Clever Hans (although Clever Hans used his hoof not his head).<br />Meanwhile, another Scotland Yard detective named Hudspith is hard at work on the abduction of Lucy Rideout, a young woman with a multiple-personality disorder.  He and Appleby converge on the scent when a haunted house in Bloomsbury goes missing.<br />The detectives follow the trail of the paranormal captives onto a ship bound for South America, posing as psychic Australian sheep ranchers in order to bamboozle the wealthy collector into abducting them, too.  Appleby spends his time at sea philosophizing about the gullibility of mankind and persuading his partner Hudspith to fake supernatural visions.<br />Innes's C.I.D. inspector is more intellectually morose than usual (remember that the author wrote this story in the midst of the war), but his antic streak also emerges, especially when he is persuading the gullible Hudspith to act out yet another phantasmagoric visitation.<br />\\"The Daffodil Affair\\" is vintage Appleby, in spite of its preposterous plot.  It shouldn't be the first Innes mystery you read (try \\"Hamlet, Revenge!\\" or \\"One Man Show\\"), but once you're hooked you won't be able to stop yourself from enjoying it--supernatural fizz, metaphysical speculations, counting horses, and all.Appleby spends his time at sea philosophizing about the gullibility of mankind and persuading his partner Hudspith to fake supernatural visions.<br />Innes's C.I.D. inspector is more intellectually morose than usual (remember that the author wrote this story in the midst of the war), but his antic streak also emerges, especially when he is persuading the gullible Hudspith to act out yet another phantasmagoric visitation. <br />\\"The Daffodil Affair\\" is vintage Appleby, in spite of its preposterous plot.

By the time this book (actually two books in one:  \\"Child of the Grove\\" and \\"The Last Wizard\\") begins, the Age of Mortals is in full swing and humans are running the show.  Although a few hamadryads, centaurs, dwarves, and what-have-yous are left over from the creation of the Elder Races, they usually avoid humanity.  There are a few important exceptions, including a hamadryad who bears the son of a human king, and a very bad wizard who has survived from a time when the wizards slew the gods, and dragons slew the wizards.<br />A lengthy prequel pits Rael, son of the hamadryad against the evil wizard, Kraydak.  Rael survives to beget a line of kings who are part Elder Race.  Eventually Crystal, the true heroine of this duology is born.<br />Kraydak, the wizard also survives.  He has been waiting through many boring thousands of years for the birth of Crystal, the only human who might give him a magical run for his continuing existence.  Meanwhile he amuses himself by building towers with human blood as mortar, torturing various walk-ons, etc.--even in this early novel, Tanya Huff writes zingy, attention-getting prose about evil--you gotta hate her bad guys, even though they're often her most interesting characters.<br />Presumably the good guys should be interesting, too.  My only problem with Crystal is that she doesn't have room to grow.  She starts out as a total knock-out with emerald eyes and silver hair, is born into the royal family, and is the world's most powerful wizard, except for Kraydak.  The Centaurs educate Crystal offstage, which is too bad as this might have been the most appealing part of the book.  As it is written, she enters the spotlight as a slightly sulky, sex-crazed teen-ager who happens to be a gorgeous princess-wizard.<br />In Book I, \\"Child of the Grove,\\" Crystal battles Kraydak, the wizard who killed a god.  Book II, \\"The Last Wizard\\" follows Crystal's adventures as she attempts to clean up a dead wizard's castle.

Some of the essays describe the way science is done, and the ways that ignorance or politics can interfere with its results.<br />I wish this book could have chronicled the progressive triumph of science over superstition and bureaucratic weirdness.  Instead, Helen Epstein's, &quot;The Mystery of AIDS in South Africa&quot; shows what happens when a government backs an unproven theory on the cause of HIV infection.  Another essay by Robert L. Park offers a scientific (or at least, sane) solution to a fantasy beloved of Americans:  &quot;Welcome to Planet Earth&quot; tells the true story of what happened at Roswell, New Mexico in 1947 (there actually was a secret government project).<br />A couple of essays struck me as inspired silliness.  Stephen Jay Gould's &quot;Syphilis and the Shepherd of Atlantis&quot; illuminates Fracastoro's Virgilian ode to &quot;Syphilis sive morbus Gallicus,&quot; also known as the Spanish Disease, English Disease, Neapolitan Disease, and 'Treponema pallidum.'  Andrew Sullivan's &quot;The He Hormone&quot; was not written to be silly--the author was taking testosterone to combat the fatigue of an HIV infection--but it did very much remind me of the crowing scene in &quot;Peter Pan.&quot;<br />In &quot;Running Dry,&quot; Jacques Leslie chronicles the unassailable fact that we are running out of fresh water.  Although this essay was written in 2000, it seems particularly relevant to this summer of ferocious drought and wildfire.  The author develops a somber case against our current dam-building and irrigation processes.<br />However, &quot;Running Dry&quot; wasn't the book's most shocking essay--at least for me, since I was already aware of the fresh water crisis.  The shocker was &quot;The Virus and the Vaccine&quot; by Debbie Bookchin and Jim Schumacher.  Anyone who is over the age of forty might want to read this article, which was originally published in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly.&quot;  Here is why it is so interesting:<br />&quot;A breakthrough in the war against polio had come in the early 1950s, when Jonas Salk took advantage of a new discovery:  monkey kidneys could be used to culture the abundant quantities of polio virus necessary to mass-produce a vaccine.

She was eventually demoted and lost her laboratory.  But by 1963, laboratories stopped using monkey kidneys to produce polio vaccine.)<br />The SV40 virus was presumed harmless to humans, and no further investigations were done until 1993 when Michele Carbone, an Italian pathologist, decided to research the origins of mesothelioma, a rare and deadly cancer of the mesothelial cells in the lining of the chest and lung.<br />Asbestos exposure was linked to mesothelioma, which takes twenty to forty years to develop-- but Dr. Carbone also wondered if the cancer might also be caused by SV40.<br />Read &quot;The Virus and the Vaccine&quot; to learn the results of Dr. Carbone's research--especially if you were vaccinated for polio between 1955 and 1963.

I'm afraid Sharyn McCrumb has to plead guilty to this writerly sin in &quot;The Songcatcher.&quot;  She seems to have become so fascinated by her search for her own ancestors that she incorporated large chunks of their history into this book (see &quot;The Songcatcher's&quot; Afterward), with only a slight bow to plot relevance.<br />While her ancestors are fascinating and would hold my interest for an extended e-mail conversation, they do clutter up this novel's story.  Ostensibly the author uses flashbacks to show the origin of &quot;The Rowan Staff,&quot; an ancient ballad that was passed down through generations of the McCourry family, beginning with the boy Malcom who was abducted from the Scottish island of Islay and brought to pre-Revolutionary America.  He becomes a lawyer, fights the Revolution, and emigrates to the southern Appalachian Mountains.  His progeny remain in the highlands of North Carolina and Tennessee, fight in the Civil War, World War II, and work the ancestral farm or become lawyers, all the while singing &quot;The Rowan Staff.&quot;<br />You might think this sounds like a pretty straight story line from the 1760s to the current millennium, even though the characters change, but McCrumb chooses to portray the lives of her ancestors in vignettes that are interspersed with the modern-day saga of a folksinger who is searching for an old song.<br />Actually there are two folksingers who want to record &quot;The Rowan Staff,&quot; two plane wrecks, two characters who are lost in the mountains, two ghosts, and two old folks who have the Sight.  My favorite character, Miss Nora Bonesteel, who is one of the Seers and who has shown up in previous McCrumb novels, almost gets lost in the shuffle of multiple viewpoints and the back-and-forth zap of the timeline.<br />McCrumb is a good writer and has a great ear for dialogue, but this story tries to play too many songs at once.his story tries to play too many songs at once.	2002-08-23

When the gifted neurologist wrote his autobiography, he also wrote a history of chemistry as recapitulated through his own childhood experiences.  He grew up in a very scientific family--his mother and father were physicians, and his uncle Dave (the 'Uncle Tungsten' of the title) was both a chemist and a business entrepreneur, who &quot;would spend hundreds of hours watching all the processes in his factories:  the sintering and drawing of the tungsten, the making of the coiled coils and molybdenum supports for the filaments, the filling of the bulbs with argon...&quot;<br />Uncle Tungsten allowed his nephew to perform chemical experiments in his laboratory, which contained samples of almost every element.  Oliver's &quot;physics uncle,&quot; Uncle Abe had a small telescopic observatory on top of his house, where he demonstrated the wonders of spectroscopy to his nephew:  &quot;The whole visible universe--planets, stars, distant galaxies--presented itself for spectroscopic analysis, and I got a vertiginous, almost ecstatic satisfaction from seeing familiar terrestrial elements out in space, seeing what I had known only intellectually before, that the elements were not just terrestrial but cosmic, were indeed the building blocks of the universe.&quot;<br />No wonder young Oliver grew up with a love for the elements and their chemistry!<br />Rarely do I read an autobiography and envy the author his childhood--most recent examples of this genre, e.g. &quot;A Child Called 'It'&quot; are grim, wailing texts--and that's not to say that Oliver didn't have his bad moments, too.  He endured two horrible years at a Dickensian boarding school while London was being bombed by the Germans.<br />For the most part though, his formative years were spent in a fantastic 'castle of the elements' where his &quot;many uncles and aunts and cousins served as a sort of archive or reference library&quot; to his enquiring mind.<br />In &quot;Uncle Tungsten,&quot; Dr. Sacks shares his learning experiences with us and in the process, writes a far more lucid history of chemistry and physics than any I've ever found in a textbook.  He also takes his readers on a mesmerizing, personalized tour of the elements.  If you enjoyed P.W.

One would expect this custom to lead to a dearth of wizards on the two magically merging planets of Glandair and Iomard, but just the opposite is true.  There are wizards who walk between worlds, wizards who cast death spells, wizards who do nothing but scribe, and yet more wizards who exercise what fantasy readers might consider the whole magical repertoire.  Adding to the confusion, \\"Drum Warning\\" is told from multiple points-of-view---not just wizards, but the occasional swamp witch and minor bureaucrat.  I finally had to sort the characters out by function:<br />There are three bad wizards who are murdering all would-be students on their way to a school of magery (in which the teachers don't end up as drum-heads).  There are two teen-agers, a boy and a girl, who refuse to admit to their magical potential until the bad wizards attempt to kidnap the girl, sink a couple of ships out from under the boy, then try to drop a mountain on him when he refuses to drown. There is a bandit-wizard, on the run from a troop of female warriors who want to geld him.  He seduces an alcoholic wizard, who--<br />A plot does somehow stay afloat in this confusion of magic.  One of the young mages is destined to become the Hero who saves the merging planets of Glandair and Iomard (I don't quite understand the astronomy here) from chaos.  There had been a collision seven hundred years past, when everything went to chaos.  Libraries burned.  Empires crumbled.  Network T.V. ratings declined.<br />Can a young Hero save Glandair and Iomard from another time of chaos and bad programming?  We're not even positive who will assume the role of Hero, although my money is on the twice-drowned boy.  Nevertheless lots of interesting stuff takes place in \\"Drum Warning\\" while we wait for the Hero to appear.  Little Gods torment cats, sour milk, and trash vegetable gardens.  Big Gods make an occasional appearance and precipitate weird happenings (rather in the style of British royalty).  An emperor is seduced by the Dark Side.  An army marches into the realm of the swamp witch.  Ships sink.  A wizard is turned into a drum.<br />All of this makes good reading for a rainy day, if you can keep track of who is telling the story.ds torment cats, sour milk, and trash vegetable gardens.

MacAvoy, whose debut novel was &quot;Tea with a Black Dragon,&quot; has written another charming, but lesser known fantasy called &quot;The Grey Horse.&quot;  Its story takes place in 1881, in County Connemara, Ireland, during the time when the Irish National Land League was trying to oust foreign (English) landlords and teach the local farmers to stand up for their rights to fair rents and fixed tenure on the land.  Irish revolutionaries are an integral part of MacAvoy's landscape, but they enhance the fantasy rather than intrude upon it.<br />As the novel begins, the old horse trainer, Anrai Õ Reachtaire discovers a p&uacute;ca (fairy horse) on his way to the village of Carraroe.  He mistakes it for a strayed Connemara pony stallion, standing alone on a hill, without hobble or halter.  The p&uacute;ca kneels, inciting Anrai to mount (what horseman could resist such a fair invitation?), and off they gallop on one of Fantasy's best and funniest wild rides.<br />Anrai finally manages to throw a rope halter over the pony's head:<br />&quot;Anrai felt a jolt as through the horse had shied in place.  Its sides went as stiff as wood.  It hopped and trembled and before Anrai's eyes began to steam.  Startled himself by this reaction, Anrai very warily tied the lead rope to both sides of the mouthpiece, making a sort of bridle out of the halter.  'Don't tell me you're a stranger to the old rope halter, my lad,' he whispered gently, close to the horse's ear.  He saw a round eye ringed with white, and the long, unkempt yellow tail switched left to right.  Anrai had a sinking feeling there would be a fight between himself and this horse on the stones of Knockduff Peak.<br />&quot;But he had to go home.  At this season, there were no more than two more hours of light and likely no visible moon after that.  He gave the horse an experimental squeeze of the legs.  In perfect obedience it moved down the mountainside.&quot;<br />Once haltered, the p&uacute;ca has to obey Anrai.  They canter home, and the old man spends several weeks trying to find the pony's unknown owner.  Meanwhile, although he grows fond of the grey, he obeys a hunch to leave its halter on.  It isn't until Anrai decides the stallion is really his to keep that he attempts to perform a minor operation on him---he already has two stud horses in his barn and doesn't need a third.  He and his stablehand strap the grey into a chute, and Anrai asks for his knife:<br />&quot;The grey horse gave a convulsion that shook the oak posts, so deeply sunk into stone.  The front straps broke, and it rose up screaming, not as the furious chestnut had screamed, but very like a man.<br />&quot;It stood, and seemed to dwindle, and then toppled over in confusion.  It shouted, 'By heaven, man!  Look what you are about!'  And then there was no horse.&quot;<br />Anrai, in the sudden throes of heart failure, manages to remove his halter from the p&uacute;ca, and the horse-turned-man promptly saves his life.<br />We learn why the p&uacute;ca, whose name is Ruairi MacEibhir has decided, after many centuries, to return to the haunts of man.  He has fallen in love with one of the village women and wants to court her in the guise of Anrai's stablehand.<br />The courting of M&aacute;ire NiStand&uacute;n takes the rest of the book, as she is not sure she wants to marry a sometime-man sometime-horse.  The land revolt swirls on around the quarreling couple.  Old Anrai challenges a half-English landowner to a match race:  the landlord's chestnut Thoroughbred against his grey Connemara stallion.  Anrai's no-good son deserts from the British army and slinks home to cause all sorts of trouble.  The local priest attempts to baptize Anrai's new stablehand---the p&uacute;ca survives his baptism, although the priest almost doesn't.<br />Basically, MacAvoy has written a story of life in a small, nineteenth-century Connemara village, with a horse-fairy thrown in to really get the Irish up.  Even if you've read every other Celtic fantasy to hit the shelves (there seem to be a million of them), you'll not have found one as entrancing, or as madly Gaelic as &quot;The Grey Horse.&quot;e seem to be a million of them), you'll not have found one as entrancing, or as madly Gaelic as &quot;The Grey Horse.&quot;	2002-08-10

Those joined at the head, like the Guatemalan twins recently separated at UCLA are the rarest of all, occurring in less than one in a million births.  UCLA, which has one of the world's leading neurosurgery centers is not the first operating theatre where a successful attempt was made to separate \\"craniopagus\\" twins who shared some of their neurological \\"wetware.\\"  That honor belongs to Vienna's university hospital and a team headed by pediatric neurosurgeon, Dr. Wolfgang Koos and American neurosurgeon, Dr. Robert Spetzler.<br />Step by step, \\"The Healing Blade\\" describes the operation performed on the conjoined twins.  The surgeons had been rehearsing each step, \\"together and apart, through three months\\" to acquire the necessary precision of movement.  The operation itself took place over a period of days.  Sylvester describes the scene before it began:<br />\\"At the juncture of the twin operating tables lies what appears to be a log of ironwood, dried pale and clean.  It is the long, common skull of the twins, shaved of that fringe of curly brown hair.  Nearly a foot apart two small [three-year-old] faces appear carved into the wood, one facing straight out, one cast slightly downward, both in slumber, perfect cherubim carved into the column of their skull.\\"<br />Read this fascinating account if you are at all interested in the fate of the Guatemalan twins at UCLA.  Unfortunately, the twins who were separated in Vienna later died of infection, so this is a cautionary tale.  We must not become too optimistic, even though the surgery was successful:<br />\\"In 30 attempts worldwide to separate twins joined at the head, from 1928 to 2000, only seven of the 60 children came through the surgery without brain damage; 30 died, 17 were neurologically impaired and the remainder of the cases were reported before the ultimate outcome could be determined, according to the medical journals [NY Times 08/07/2002].\\"<br />Other operations performed by Dr. Spetzler had more successful, long term outcomes as described in \\"The Healing Blade.\\"  This book focuses on three main subjects:  Dr. Spetzler and his contributions to neurosurgery; the history of the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, where Dr. Spetzler performs the majority of his operations; and a new state of the art procedure called the \\"Standstill,\\" which is a nickname for hypothermic arrest.  In a sense, the patient dies for an hour--no blood and therefore no oxygen can reach his brain while he is chilled down to the point where his heart stops.<br />This book is much more unputdownable than the latest techno-thriller by, say Clancy or Ludlum, because it is true.  The author's attention to detail places us right into the operating room with the surgical team, and deep into the magical cavern of the human skull.  The only dry stretches of text concern the founding and history of the Barrow Neurological Institute, and they don't take up too much room.  The author also works in a brief history of neurosurgery, but none of it is quite as fascinating as the scenes where Dr. Spetzler is poised over his intraoperative microscope, carefully dissecting an aneurysm that threatens to explode through the micro-currents of a human intelligence.ions performed by Dr. Spetzler had more successful, long term outcomes as described in \\"The Healing Blade.\\"  This book focuses on three main subjects:  Dr. Spetzler and his contributions to neurosurgery; the history of the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, where Dr. Spetzler performs the majority of his operations; and a new state of the art procedure called the \\"Standstill,\\" which is a nickname for hypothermic arrest.

Le Guin's new novel, \\"The Other Wind,\\" it hadn't occurred to me that previous volumes left unresolved the fate of the souls in Earthsea's equivalent of Hades, i.e. the Dry Land.  These mournful undead played a prominent role in \\"The Farthest Shore,\\" where the Archmage Ged and his companion, Arren descended into the underworld to battle an evil mage.<br />Ged and Arren returned out of the Dry Land, but left behind those who were neither alive nor truly dead.<br />Who were those shadows of the living?  Why were they condemned to lead such miserable half-lives, in which Arren \\"saw the mother and child who had died together, and they were in the dark land together; but the child did not run, nor did it cry, and the mother did not hold it or ever look at it.  And those who had died for love passed each other in the streets.\\"<br />\\"The Other Wind\\" debates the riddle of a 'true' death, and reveals how the very existence of the Dry Land threatens the people of Earthsea.<br />Actually there is more debate than action in this latest Le Guin fantasy, but as always she delivers her message through her complex and likeable characters.  There lives the true magic in this series.<br />The reader is first introduced to the plight of the undead through Alder, a recent widower who can magically mend crockery and other mundane items.  In a dream, his deceased wife kisses him over the low stone wall that separates the living world from the Dry Land.  Subsequent dreams reveal other undead, who beg him to release them from the dark and return them to the land of the living.<br />Alder flees to the Island of Gont, to seek help from the former Archmage.  But old Ged used up all of his magic while defeating the Dry Land mage (in \\"The Farthest Shore\\") and he counsels Alder to ask for assistance from the new King.<br />At the royal residence on Havnor, Alder meets many characters from previous Earthsea stories:  Ged's wife, Tenar who was formerly priestess of the Tombs of Atuan; the burned child, Tehanu who can summon dragons; the dragon, Irien who assumes the shape of a woman; and Arren, the young King himself, companion to Ged on his fateful journey to the Dry Land.<br />King Arren (who now uses his true name, Lebannen) has problems of his own, including rampaging dragons and a heavily veiled princess, foisted off on him by a former enemy who orders the King to marry her.  Nevertheless he agrees to help Arren, the sorcerous pot-mender who seems to have acquired the power to destroy the balance between Earthsea's underworld and its realm of the living.<br />The climax to \\"The Other Wind\\" takes place on Roke, the island of Mages, where the author ties all of her loose plot devices together--EXCEPT for the prophecy regarding 'The Woman of Gont.'<br />Admittedly the former archmage, Ged offered Alder 'a' solution to the prophecy before the sorcerer left Gont, but it wasn't very satisfying.<br />My hope is that there is time for at least one more Earthsea fantasy --one where the prophecy first revealed in \\"Tehanu (volume three)\\" is fully explained.of Atuan; the burned child, Tehanu who can summon dragons; the dragon, Irien who assumes the shape of a woman; and Arren, the young King himself, companion to Ged on his fateful journey to the Dry Land.<br />King Arren (who now uses his true name, Lebannen) has problems of his own, including rampaging dragons and a heavily veiled princess, foisted off on him by a former enemy who orders the King to marry her.

S. Le Fanu (first ghostly tale published in 1838) and M. R. James (first collection of stories published in 1904).  She also leaves out most of Victorian ladies whose ghost stories are still in print today, e.g. Mary Elizabeth Braddon, E. Nesbit, and Mrs. Riddell.<br />I would classify this book as an overview of the literature of supernatural fantasy and horror (including a Byronic poem about a vampire).  The ghost story as defined and brought to its peak by Victorian and Edwardian authors, receives only brief mention in the chapter, \\"Modern Ghosts.\\"<br />Scarborough begins with the Gothic Romance, of which she says:  \\"The mysterious twilights of medievalism invited eyes tired of the noonday glare of Augustan formalism.  The natural had become familiar to monotony, hence men craved the supernatural.  And so the Gothic novel came into being.\\"<br />'Gothic' is used to designate the eighteenth-century, pseudo-medieval novel of horror.  The author begins with Horace Walpole's, \\"The Castle of Otranto\\"--if you are at all fond of Regency romances, you are bound to run across a heroine who is reading Walpole's tale of mad monks and haunted castles, or Mrs. Radcliffe's horrific \\"Mysteries of Udolpho.\\"  These novels depicting \\"decaying castles with treacherous stairways leading to mysterious rooms, halls of black marble, and vaults whose great rusty keys groan in the locks\\"--plus a heroine who wanders through spider-webbed corridors at midnight--did not have much staying power.  According to Scarborough, Jane Austin finally gave this genre the kiss of death when she satirized their gloomy, overwrought style in \\"Northanger Abbey,\\" which remained unpublished until after her death in 1818.  \\"The Supernatural in Modern English Fiction\\" describes many gothic romance peculiarities in detail, while having a certain amount of gentle fun with them.<br />A chapter on European supernatural literature is followed by the aforementioned chapter on \\"Modern Ghosts.\\"  The author makes much of the effect Poe, Balzac, Hoffmann and other Romantic supernaturalists had on the nineteenth century English and American ghost story.  Balzac in particular exerted a strong influence over Edward George Bulwer-Lytton, English author of \\"The Haunters and the Haunted,\\" and progenitor of that infamous opening sentence, \\"It was a dark and stormy night...\\" (yes, that Bulwer-Lytton).  Other stories that the author selects for discussion depend more on the Romantic tradition of insanity, gruesome decline, and horrid death to spark them along, rather than a purely supernatural mechanism.  (As a matter of fact, Scarborough even published a novel in which the heroine was driven mad by the wind.)<br />She also expends a great deal of print on Spiritualism (which was already on the decline when this book was written), and the mystical, folkloric pantheism of such writers as W.B. Yeats (\\"The Celtic Twilight\\") and Algernon Blackwood (\\"Ancient Sorceries\\").<br />Scarborough draws heavily upon Romanticism, Spiritualism, and folklore for her chapters on \\"The Devil and His Allies,\\" \\"Supernatural Life (which contains an excellent exposition on the legend of the Wandering Jew),\\" and \\"The Supernatural in Folk-tales.\\"<br />\\"Supernatural Science\\" is the only really dated chapter in this book, with its discussions of hypnotism, the Fourth Dimension, uncanny chemistry, and students who exchange eyeballs.  Even here, the author provides interesting commentary on A. Conan Doyle, H. G. Wells, Arthur Machen (whom she despises), and Ambrose Bierce, among other authors who were popular at the beginning of the twentieth century (and still are).<br />\\"The Supernatural in Modern English Fiction\\" should appeal to anyone who is interested in the evolution of fantasy and horror literature.  Try \\"Elegant Nightmares:  The English Ghost Story from Le Fanu to Blackwood\\" by Jack Sullivan or \\"Night Visitors:  The Rise and Fall of the English Ghost Story\\" by Julia Briggs if your interest is more focused on literature that is entirely devoted to ghosts.atural in Modern English Fiction\\" should appeal to anyone who is interested in the evolution of fantasy and horror literature.

The hero, Cazaril has just escaped a stint as a galley slave, and makes his way back to the royacy of Chalion, where he once served as a page.<br />I've never met a Bujold hero I didn't like, and Cazaril is no exception.  He's intelligent, principled, and likeable, not to mention courageous and a heckuva swordsman.  Chalion's Dowager Provincara who knew Cazaril as a page recognizes these qualities in him and promptly appoints him secretary-tutor to the wayward royesse, Iselle.<br />There follows a great deal of court intrigue--this book starts out rather slowly--and Iselle gradually learns to trust, even emulate her new tutor.  She and her brother, the King's heir are shipped to the royal court at Cardegoss where the backstabbing and politics grow even more intense.  Cazaril discovers that the powerful enemy who sent him to the galleys is now the King's chief counselor.  The shadow of this circumstance at first falls on Cazaril alone.  Attempts are made to discredit or kill him.  Then the weak, ailing King betroths his sister, Iselle to the worst blackguard in court:  his counselor's son, Dondo.<br />Now the story gets really interesting.<br />Cazaril attempts to assassinate Dondo and fails.  On the eve of Iselle's wedding, Cazaril is driven to sacrifice his own life in the Death Magic ritual, so that Dondo may also die.  Iselle's prospective husband does drop dead, but somehow the Death Magic ritual goes astray and Cazaril survives, transformed into a saint of the Five-fold Path, and the unwilling host to the vengeful spirits of both Dondo and the Death Demon.<br />Now that he is a saint, Cazaril can actually see the curse that hangs over the King and all members of his family, including Iselle.<br />The rest of the book concerns Cazaril's efforts to lift the Curse of Chalion before he is eaten up from within by Dondo and the Death Demon.<br />This is a good adventure fantasy, entwined with a subtle love story and an interesting, magical religion.

Each chapter ended with this reader wincing for the author, who had just spent the night stumbling through a Minnesota swamp, his eyes almost swollen shut from mosquito bites, searching for his runaway dog team, or had been blown down an Alaskan mountainside with his team, in the midst of a blinding snowstorm.<br />Not to mention the five-skunk night.<br />It takes a great deal of physical as well as mental toughness to train for the Iditarod, much less run a team of half-wild dogs in the actual race.<br />&quot;Winterdance&quot; reminds me of Algernon Blackwood's &quot;Wendigo:&quot; in both stories men are caught by the spirit of the Great Northern Wilderness, and perish or almost perish.  I think the most telling moment in Paulsen's book comes when he runs his team to the end of his trapline---and then keeps on going in the dead of a Minnesota winter, just to see what lies beyond the next hill.  His wife's intuition to call out a search team was correct, even though Paulsen eventually did turn back.  The 'Wendigo' or wanderlust had almost captured his soul.<br />It also reminds me of &quot;Call of the Wild.&quot; Like Jack London, Paulsen has a laconic, fluid writing style, and both authors include the Wilderness itself as one of their major characters.  I won't say that either man subscribed to Blackwood's weird brand of pantheistic mysticism, but read how Paulsen slowly bonds with his dogs--and other wild animals.<br />This book is also a grand dog story with more pratfalls than a &quot;Three Stooges&quot; movie.  The author spent many a night on his backside, being dragged down a dirt road (or worse, through a second-growth forest) by his lusty team.  Running the Iditarod takes a very special madness, and Paulsen endured moose attacks, blizzards, dog bites, and too many helpings of moose chili to draw us into his very beautiful and brutal world.	2002-07-19

Chesterton).<br />Every good fantasy is allegorical of some view of the universe.  &quot;The High House&quot; concerns itself with the battle between the created Universe and Chaos.  I use 'created' in the religious sense of the word.  This book is filled with robust, old-fashioned Victorian religion--&quot;Onward, Christian Soldiers&quot; and all that--in which God and Newton ordered the heavens and our world.<br />The Master of High House (also called Evenmere) has been given the task of balancing the forces of chaos against those of the created universe.  In High House, which seems to have an infinity of corridors and rooms, certain lamps must always be lit against nightfall, and certain clocks must always be kept wound.<br />Leviathan lives in the attic, and the dark river of Entropy is kept behind a locked door in the cellar.<br />There is also a Room of Horrors in the cellar where the Master's little son, Carter is imprisoned by the Forces of Chaos, whose representative is a faceless English Bobby.  His father rescues him, but Chaos steals the master keys to the hidden rooms of High House.  After the faceless Bobby catches Carter again and throws him down a well, the Master of High House decides to foster Carter out to friends, who live in safe, sane Victorian England.<br />Fourteen years pass before Carter returns to Evenmere and sees it as an adult:<br />&quot;For the first time he realized it was a truly beautiful pile of building, all masonry, oak, and deep golden brick, a unique blend of styles--Elizabethan and Jacobean fused with Baroque...Upon the balustrades and turrets stood carved lions, knights, gnomes, and pinecones; iron crows faced outward at the four corners.  The Elizabethan entrance, the centerpiece of the manor, was framed by gargantuan gate piers and pavilions, combining Baroque outlines with Jacobean ornamentation...At the main entrance stood the tall, gray marble sculpture of a figure dressed in the robe of a monk, his hood thrown back from his face, his long locks rippling over his shoulders, eyes to the sky, his muscled arms held before him as if he faced a great northern storm, more like a god of thunder, despite the cross hanging from his neck, than a pious pilgrim.&quot;<br />Carter's father, the Master of High House has disappeared down one of the House's hidden corridors to the Land of the Rainbow Sea.  In his absence, the Forces of Chaos erupt into the House, and Carter must do battle with them, as he learns the awesome secret of High House and discovers how he might rescue his missing father.<br />&quot;The High House&quot; is a unique venture into fantasy.  I had to keep checking the publication date (1998) to convince myself it was actually written in the twentieth, not the nineteenth century.  The House itself is lovingly described in all of its beauty and horror.  Unfortunately the characters are not as well delineated--the only two who stood out for me were Enoch, who might have been an Old Testament prophet (he had long talks with God) and is now the clock-winder in High House; and Leviathan, the shadowy, omniscient monster in the attic.  The female characters were pretty two-dimensional (another Victorian conceit?).  There is the standard wicked step-mother.  Anina, the goddess of Order, and a Porcelain Duchess play minor roles, along with a gaggle of faceless maids.  The book rises above the standard, male-bonding, fantasy quest only through the grandly imagined eccentricities and unique byways of the House itself.que outlines with Jacobean ornamentation...At the main entrance stood the tall, gray marble sculpture of a figure dressed in the robe of a monk, his hood thrown back from his face, his long locks rippling over his shoulders, eyes to the sky, his muscled arms held before him as if he faced a great northern storm, more like a god of thunder, despite the cross hanging from his neck, than a pious pilgrim.&quot;<br />Carter's father, the Master of High House has disappeared down one of the House's hidden corridors to the Land of the Rainbow Sea.

There's even a story of automatic writing.<br />Whoever dreamed America's Midwest could be so haunted?<br />Beth Scott and Michael Norman tell good stories, too.  There is some repetition, which is to be expected in a collection of 120+ stories--it's amazing how many Midwestern towns are haunted by a 'lady in black'--but some of the tales (as far as I know) are completely unique.  One of my favorites is \\"The Abduction of Oliver Larch.\\"  Here's how this mysterious tale from Indiana starts:<br />\\"In the eerie, flickering glow of a kerosene lamp, Matthew Larch followed his son's footprints in the snow.  They started at the kitchen door and extended some seventy-five feet from the house.  There were no other marks on the freshly-fallen flakes.<br />\\"Young Oliver's tracks just stopped.  The oak water bucket he had carried lay on its side several yards to the left.<br />\\"Matthew Larch huddled under the dark sky with the small group of family and friends.  Not a word passed among them.  They listened intently, but could scarcely believe their senses.<br />\\"Oliver was crying, his voice growing fainter and fainter as he screamed for help...screamed from somewhere above them...in the black, cold sky.\\"<br />This incident took place on Christmas Eve, 1889, so forget about helicopters.<br />The stories are arranged by state, including Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, and Wisconsin.  The authors do not claim to be psychics or ghost-hunters.  Some of their tales are pure folklore.  Others have been collected from books or periodicals of limited circulation.  Many of the contemporary accounts have never been published, before appearing in this book.<br />If you are interested in the unusual or the terrifying, read \\"Haunted Heartland\\" during one of our Midwestern thunderstorms.

Most of the luncheon chit-chat concerns bats in the church belfry, and the reader is gently introduced to the people who will soon be suspects in the murder of Lord Osprey.<br />As always with Michael Innes's mysteries, you can enjoy \\"Appleby and the Ospreys\\" for its sophisticated, veddy upper-class British dialogue, as well as for the fiendish commission and solution of the murder<br />H.R.F. Keating in his 1987 book, \\"Crime & Mystery:  the 100 Best Books,\\" says this about our literate ex-Commissioner of New Scotland Yard:<br />\\"To Appleby one could well apply the words which Michael Innes, writing under his own name in the novella \\"The Man Who Wrote Detective Stories,\\" employs to describe that hero: 'He loved tumbling out scraps of poetry from a ragbag collection in his mind - and particularly in absurd and extravagant contexts.' \\"<br />Since this is a vintage British manor house mystery, the guests and family of Sir Osprey are in the library drinking sherry when a mysterious shadow is seen on the balcony over the moat.  Upon investigation, no one is seen, but the mysterious intruder is remembered when Sir Osprey is found, stabbed to death in his library later that evening.<br />Appleby soon discovers that many people had a motive for killing the late, unlamented lord.  The local publican bursts into the manor and threatens to murder an already-dead Sir Osprey, who he claims had been fooling around with his daughter.  There is also a valuable coin collection hidden somewhere within the vast architectural pile of Clusters.  Supposedly only Sir Osprey knew its whereabouts, but many of his guests are avid numismatists.  Did one of them gain access to the coins, then murder his or her host?<br />Appleby solves the mystery with his usual wit, ingenuity, and aplomb.  The bats come to his aid in a very startling manner upon the discovery of the murderer.ery of the murderer.	2002-07-12

You're a tyro yourself, so whenever you go CD shopping or attend a live performance, he entertains you with a humorous summary of the libretto (not too hard to do with an opera if it's not \\"Wozzeck\\"), tells you which bits to really listen for, and provides a critique of singers.  He's an expert---after all he was the deputy chairman of one of England's great opera houses---but he's not a snob.  Listen to what he has to say about death in the mystic land of Oprania:<br />\\"Death is extremely common and has an almost universal characteristic unknown in our world, namely a period of Imminence during which the doomed person suffers a compulsion to sing.  There are few known cases in Oprania where death has occurred without an aria, or at least a cavatina, being delivered during Imminence.  The period of Imminence for long deaths can last for up to a whole act.  Not even decapitation can ensure an aria-free death...\\"<br />If you think bursting into song at death's door is highly unlikely, listen to what the author--I mean your uncle--has to say about Valentin's death (he was stabbed by Faust with the help of the devil) in Gounod's \\"Faust:\\"<br />\\"Valentin is found dying in the street by a respectful and horrified chorus.  He makes the customary brave gestures of a soldier in the face of death and turns on Marguerite [his sister who is Faust's lover] rather nastily (first in recitative and then in a short aria) saying that the only course open to her now is to become a hooker for the rest of her life.\\"<br />Valentin curses his sister and dies, and for all his musical effort is only awarded one star (out of a possible three) by Sir Denis.  \\"Faust\\" itself is rated a 'beta' (on a scale where 'alpha-plus' is reserved for truly great operas such as \\"The Marriage of Figaro\\", and 'gamma or less' for truly forgettable operas such as \\"La Rondine\\").<br />I almost subtracted a star from my review because Sir Denis awarded 'betas' to two of my favorite operas (Handel's 'Caesar' and Verdi's 'Forza'), but \\"A Night at the Opera\\" is way too good and funny and idiosyncratic (in the grand style that only British authors seem to be able to carry off) to be anything but a five-star book.<br />The eighty-three operas that were chosen to appear in this book all had three or more versions listed in the \\"Gramophone\\" CD catalogue of December 1992, from Cilea's \\"Adriana Lecouvreur\\" to Berg's \\"Wozzeck.\\"  Each opera's libretto is lovingly (and somewhat whackily) described.  There is a \\"Look Out For\\" section that describes and rates the opera's arias, preludes, choruses, intermezzos, etc. with one to three stars.  Example:  \\"Si adempia il voler\\" from Puccini's \\"Tosca\\":<br />\\"The final scene [of Act II]:  Scarpia sits down to write the phoney letter of safe conduct to a sweeping melody,** calm but full of menace, giving us a breathing space between the storms past and the storm to come:  then the 'kiss of Tosca' [she stabs Scarpia] with all the stops out--and the calm melody plays the scene out (All Rome trembled before him) ending with a sonorous funereal version of Scarpia's theme accompanied by a death rattle of drums.  Stupendous.\\"<br />Stupendous, indeed, even though Sir Denis only gives it two stars.<br />The final two sections describing each opera are \\"News and Gossip\\"--background on how and why the opera was composed, and \\"Comment\\"--the author's summary of where the opera fits in the repertoire (plus any other remarks he chooses to make).<br />This is a grand old book, all 959 pages of it.  I read the whole thing, even the penultimate \\"Words Words Words\\" dictionary, and the final page of acknowledgements, \\"Friends, Supporters, Colleagues and Minders.\\"<br />Please, just one more quotation from the final page:<br />\\"I would like to thank:  Bamber Gascoigne for giving me the idea in the first place (and let it be noted that this handsome acknowledgement in no way affects the author's title to 100% of the copyright).\\"<br />I loved this book and you will too, even if you only have a sneaking fondness for the 'Queen of Music'.uthor's title to 100% of the copyright).\\"<br />I loved this book and you will too, even if you only have a sneaking fondness for the 'Queen of Music'.	2002-07-09

In both books, Ewald uses cholera as an example of a germ that has evolved to benignness in countries with clean water supplies, but is still a killer in countries with bad plumbing.<br />\\"Plague Time\\" takes this thesis a step further and concludes that many so-called chronic diseases such as atherosclerosis and certain cancers are also caused--or at least triggered by infection.<br />Peptic ulcers are a case in point.  Even though some doctors back in the 1940s realized that antibiotics could heal ulcers, the technique never caught on in mainstream medicine.  It was too easy to blame the patient's life-style and stress levels, and besides 'Helicobacter pylori' was hard to find.  Four decades later, researchers in Perth, Australia discovered that patients with ulcers and gastritis improved after tetracycline.  One of the researchers, Barry Marshall drank an infective dose of 'H. Pylori,' got gastritis, then cured himself with antibiotics.  \\"Still, it was only in the mid-1990s that the medical establishment finally generally accepted the idea that peptic and duodenal ulcers are infectious diseases.\\"<br />So what will the decisive medical technologies of the future be, if it is indeed accepted that many chronic illnesses are caused by infection?  The author believes that, \\"Vaccines, antimicrobials, and hygienic improvements may control most heart disease, infertility, mental illnesses, and cancers, especially if these solutions are used not just to decimate pathogens but also to direct the evolution of the causative microbes.\\"<br />\\"Plague Time\\" is a fascinating look at what may be the near-future of medicine if physicians can be trained to look at infectious diseases in terms of evolutionary epidemiology.ecially if these solutions are used not just to decimate pathogens but also to direct the evolution of the causative microbes.\\"<br />\\"Plague Time\\" is a fascinating look at what may be the near-future of medicine if physicians can be trained to look at infectious diseases in terms of evolutionary epidemiology.	2002-07-04

He studied biology at Yale University, received his Ph.D. in political science from MIT, and served in the State Department, the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.  So, although his descriptions of past epidemics are horrible enough, it's the present and future threat of smallpox---the second half of this book---where Tucker really scared the bejabbers out of me.  I had no idea that the Soviet bioweapons program, Vector, had gone as far as it did in developing viral weapons.  According to the author, \\"Some 4,500 people, including about 250 Ph.D.-level scientists, worked at Vector in the late 1980s...One goal of the...program was to develop a smallpox-based biological weapon containing virulence genes from Ebola hemorrhagic fever virus.  At least theoretically, such a viral chimera would combine the hardiness and transmissibility of smallpox with the lethality of Ebola, which was between 90 percent and 100 percent fatal, resulting in an 'absolute' biological weapon.\\"<br />The real irony of the Vector bioweapons program was that the Soviet Union (along with the United States) was a major factor in eradicating the scourge of smallpox from the world in the 1970s.<br />Where are those 4,500 people who worked at Vector, now?  Where is the twenty tons of smallpox virus formulation that was stocked at the Center of Virology in Zagorsk?  The Soviets supposedly destroyed the stockpile in the late 1980s, but the smallpox seed cultures and the expertise to manufacture biological weapons from them still remain.<br />The author clearly presents the arguments for and against retaining the known remaining smallpox virus stocks in Atlanta and Moscow.  However, I believe he sides with the 'destructionists' rather than the 'retentionists':  \\"From a practical standpoint, now that the DNA sequences of representative strains of variola virus hade been determined, the live virus was no longer needed to identify smallpox if it were to reappear in the future.  Nor would live variola [smallpox] virus be required to protect against a future outbreak of smallpox, since the small pox vaccine--based on the distinct vaccinia virus--could be retained and stockpiled for insurance purposes.\\"<br />The long, difficult task of eliminating smallpox from the world (as thrillingly described in \\"Scourge\\") will not be complete until all known and rogue virus stocks (believed held by North Korea, Iran, Iraq, and possibly China) are destroyed.  The world's population has grown increasingly vulnerable to the disease since the last official vaccination programs were eliminated in 1984, as the protective immunity induced by the vaccine lasts only about seven to ten years.  Nor is there an effective medical treatment for smallpox.<br />As Tucker states in his closing sentence:  \\"Until humanity's legal and moral restraints catch up with its scientific and technological achievements, the eradication of smallpox will remain as much a cautionary tale as an inspirational one.\\"ermined, the live virus was no longer needed to identify smallpox if it were to reappear in the future.

The author is both a writer and a cartoonist and her lively drawings decorate the book from the casting and initial set designs, through the final production of Handel's &quot;Xerxes.&quot;<br />Even if you didn't see the original English National Opera production of &quot;Xerxes,&quot; you can purchase the Home Vision video of the same production featured in &quot;Backstage at the Opera.&quot;  It was fun to read about, say the construction of the stage props and then actually see how they were used during a performance.  The author was particularly fond of the twelve cactuses.  They had to be brought on stage with &quot;dignified haste&quot; and then struck in something like five seconds while the chorus sang the ritornello of the chorus, &quot;Long live Xerxes.&quot;  Needless to say, &quot;the cactuses led a very tough life indeed.&quot;<br />David Fielding's stage design re-created Vauxhall Gardens as it was in Handel's time, and he specified that the cactuses had to look 'serious' and 'real,' which meant that they had to be relatively heavy (the largest cactus was eleven feet high).  The author visited the Props Department to see how they were made:<br />&quot;The chorus, it was felt, might have their minds on their music, so they opted for having the cactuses light enough to carry but heavy enough to make it quite obvious that their porters were using some effort.  They were given a metal core of two steel rods and carved in foam rubber with an electric carving knife.  The whole cactus was then covered in fine muslin which, given its fine weave is extremely difficult to tear, and finished with a latex skin.  Finally they were painted and provided with extras such as bristles and pith balls.&quot;<br />Follow Sarah Lenton as she visits the dressing rooms, Wigs and Make up, Lighting, the Stage, and the Crew.  The opera production needed eighteen stage hands to run it:  four Prop staff, ten techs, and four Flymen.

In the annals of deceiving husbands, George shines with convincing decency. He wants to do the right thing.  He wants to regain his sexual prowess, return to his wife, Bertha and live happily ever after.  Unfortunately Doris, the woman he chooses to restore his virility is one of his social work clients.<br />Patricia Bouton-Masoni has written a multi-layered, stream of consciousness journey through the choices George is forced to make, once he commits adultery and once he suspects his wife of doing the same.  He blames himself for Bertha's faithlessness, but in betraying his work ethic by sleeping with one of his clients, his cure turns out to be worse than his disease.<br />The author, herself a social worker, is particularly skilled at linking George's feeling of burn-out and helplessness at his job, with his choice of mistress.  George cons himself into thinking that Doris is benefiting from their affair.  He gifts her with little things:  boots; a blouse; candy.  But there is a darker side to their relationship:<br />\\"She'd [Doris] become a symbol.  She was all the ones who had frustrated me for so many years.  Women like Doris who had bad judgment, got deserted, didn't know how to say no to having kids.  They were recipients of bashes in the face from husbands, or lovers, and never talked about it.  Women martyrs.  My inability to change their lives had cultivated a hatred for them, for their always being there:  The Poor Woman That Never Goes Away.\\"<br />While George's affair with Doris is resolved in a surprising (and wickedly humorous) fashion, his fellow social workers continue to struggle with their own problems:  adultery; same-sex affairs; an abusive boyfriend.  The only one who seems in charge of her life is Clare, the lesbian, and eventually, Bertha.<br />Finally George is shaken loose from his emotional moorings and makes a surprising journey to Africa.

Neurosurgery is a very unforgiving craft, and not all of the stories in this book have a happy ending.  Neurosurgeons must tackle some pretty hopeless cases, and the human brain is a very unforgiving operating theatre.<br />Nevertheless, &quot;When the Air Hits Your Brain&quot; is an unputdownable read.  I've been through it twice now---once during a night where I couldn't sleep anyway.  If you do intend to sleep, don't read it right before going to bed.<br />Here are the author's five rules for neurosurgery interns:<br />1. &quot;You ain't never the same when the air hits your brain.&quot;<br />2. &quot;The only minor operation is one that someone else is doing.&quot;<br />3. &quot;If the patient isn't dead, you can always make him worse if you try hard enough.&quot;<br />4. &quot;One look at the patient is better than a thousand phone calls from the nurse.&quot;<br />5. &quot;Operating on the wrong patient or doing the wrong side of the body makes for a very bad day--always ask the patient what side their pain is on, which leg hurts, which hand is numb.&quot;<br />Emotionally, Dr. Vertosick's worst rotation was to the local Children's Hospital.  A child who was born with an inoperable brain tumor is the focus of the chapter entitled &quot;Rebecca.&quot;<br /> A baby's brain is very hard to operate on:  &quot;At six weeks of age, the unmyelinated brain is thick soup which can be inadvertently vacuumed away by operative suctions.  Moreover, nerves the thickness of pencil lead in adults are little more than a spider's web in a baby.&quot;<br />Dr. Vertosick doesn't spend the whole book wisecracking.

For instance, the Crimean War gets one sentence:<br />\\"The end of the Crimean War was celebrated at a banquet in Dolmabahçe Sarayi on 13 July, 1856, an occasion that also marked the dedication of the new palace.\\"<br />Private means private, although there isn't much sex in the book.  But it does dispel a few European myths about the Sultan's love life--for instance, the myth that he tossed a handkerchief to the woman with whom he wished to spend the night.  Only Sultan Ibrahim the Mad (1640-8) seems to have lived down to our expectations.  According to Demetrius Cantemir (his biographer):<br />\\"'As Murad [Mad Murad, the previous sultan] was wholly addicted to wine, so was Ibrahim to lust...He cover'd the walls of his chamber with looking glass, that his love-battles might seem to be acted in several places at once...he put whole sable skins under him, in a notion that his lust would be inflam'd, if his love-toil were render'd more difficult by the glowing of his knees...'\\"<br />Mostly, the author writes about the politics of the seraglio:  the power of the Sultan's mother, the 'valide sultan'; the imprisonment and frequent murder of his brothers; the hierarchy of concubines, wives, favorites, and eunuchs.  It's quite a fascinating and beautiful, self-absorbed world, although I wouldn't have wanted to have been one of the Sultan's brothers.  It's no wonder three Sultans in a row went mad while they were imprisoned by the previous ruler (before Mad Murad came Sultan Mustafa, whose \\"mental condition had not been generally known he became sultan, but then it became obvious to all who came into contact with him that he was insane and incapable of ruling on his own...\\"<br />Many of the Osmanli Sultans were deposed and reincarcerated by their relatives, and the rumor about their concubines ending up in a sack in the Bosphorus seems to be verified by the author.<br />All in all during Osmanli rule, it was a bad time to be a Sultan's brother, or a deposed Sultan's concubine.<br />If you'd like to read about the public lives of the sultans, try \\"The Decline and Fall of the Ottoman Empire,\\" by Alan Palmer.

Gallorette, for example, has her lifetime track performance record included in \\"Past Performances:  1940's,\\" but there is no text description of this fine racing mare's history.<br />This is a big, glossy, coffee-table-sized book with many photographs (some in color) of the century's great Thoroughbreds.  Another book with a similar theme is \\"Thoroughbred Champions: Top 100 Racehorses of the 20th Century\\" by the staff of the \\"Blood-Horse.\\"  I'd choose \\"The Daily Racing Form (DRF)\\" book over the \\"Blood-Horse\\" book for better writing, and vice-versa for better organization and price---the DRF 'Champions' is organized by decade and the \\"Blood Horse\\" Champions is organized by Thoroughbred (and is much less expensive).<br />All of the triple crown winners are in the DRF \\"Champions\\" text, as are the sterling performers of the 'Class of 1954:'  Bold Ruler; Round Table; Gallant Man; Gen. Duke, Iron Liege; and Federal Hill.  After listening to many of the racing commentators castigate the current crop of three-year-olds as 'ordinary,' it is a pleasure to read about what was probably the \\"finest 3-year-old campaign in history\\"---Bold Ruler was \\"one of the fastest horses ever to race in America\\" and went on to have an extraordinary career at stud.  \\"Round Table is hailed as one of the finest turf horses of the century,\\" and of course 1957 was the year that Bill Shoemaker misjudged the finish line during the Kentucky Derby and stood up in his stirrups too soon, giving the race to Iron Liege over Gallant Man.<br />If you enjoyed \\"Seabiscuit\\" and would like to learn more about the great race horses of the twentieth century, I recommend both this book, and its rival by the staff of the \\"Blood-Horse.\\"	2002-06-09

A 'normal' flu epidemic kills thousands every year, mainly the elderly, the very young, and the immuno-suppressed.  The 1918 virus killed people in their prime.<br />Whether the virulence of the virus is still a mystery is up for debate (something Kolata neglects to mention). In \\"Evolution of Infectious Disease (published in 1994),\\" Paul Ewald theorizes on why the virus was so virulent and why it killed young to middle-aged adults:<br />\\"The environmental conditions associated with the trench warfare of World War I could hardly have been more favorable for the evolution of increased virulence of airborne pathogens like influenza.  Soldiers in the trenches were grouped so closely that even immobile infecteds could transmit pathogens.  When a soldier was too sick to fight, he was typically removed from his trenchmates.  But by that time trenchmates often would have been infected because rates of shedding are highest at the onset of illness, which typically occurs two to three days after exposure (Cate 1972, Berlin 1980).\\"<br />If it was indeed the conditions of war that made the flu so virulent (Ewald makes a very good case), it is also true that the flu helped to end the war.  Kolata quotes German General Erich von Ludendorff as saying:  \\"The flu...contributed to the failure of his July offensive, a battle plan that nearly won the war for Germany.\\"<br />The flu was brought to the United States by a group of sailors who docked in Boston, in August, 1918.  From there, it spread to the crowded army camps and into the civilian population.  Kolata's descriptions of how people died and how the bodies had to be disposed of is quite gruesome and compelling.<br />The author doesn't end her story in 1919, when the flu pandemic finally died away.  She continues on with the search for the killer virus.  Many different theories on the origin and virulence of the virus are presented in the course of the search---and most of them are finally discarded.  The only slow spots in \\"Flu\\" are a couple of chapters on the 'Swine flu' vaccination program and the resulting litigation.<br />\\"Flu\\" is a quick, exciting read, but you might also want to check out Paul W.

I was worried when the 'ill-made mute' turned drop-dead gorgeous at the end of volume 1, but luckily it doesn't seem to affect the heroine, Rohain's pluck, or her determination to discover her pre-amnesiac past.<br />There is a mounting tension in this book that was missing in the relatively plotless first volume of the trilogy.  The author begins to frame the overarching struggle between good and evil.  She begins to drop hints as to why it is so important that Rohain should recover her past.<br />Some of the hints aren't so subtle:  The Wild Hunt mounts a full-scale, coordinated assault on the tower where Rohain is visiting; the forces of evil blow up an island, Krakatau-style, where she seeks refuge. (There are a few minor errors regarding lava viscosity and the behavior of tsunamis, but overall this section of the book is a splendid, scary reinterpretation of the eruption of the Indonesian volcano, Krakatau in 1883).<br />As in \\"The Ill-Made Mute,\\" Cecilia Dart-Thornton specializes in long, static, but beautiful descriptions of scenery, clothing, courtly manners, holiday feasts, the land of Faêran (Faêrie), etc.  Even though these descriptions slow down the action, they really bring the reader into the scene:<br />\\"They found shelter in a mossy stone ruin that had once, in ages long past, conceivably been a byre.  Honeysuckle and traveler's joy formed a roof over the few remaining, slug-haunted walls.  Against those they piled dry bracken to serve as a bed.

I'm right there under the honesuckle, eating cold porridge with Rohain and her friends.<br />Read \\"The Ill-Made Mute\\" (in which Rohain is called 'Imrhien') before tackling \\"The Lady of the Sorrows\\" or you might not understand the story and all of its lovingly crafted accouterments.

Reading &quot;The Ill-Made Mute&quot; was like looking through a series of Aubrey Beardsley drawings---the detail was minute, intense and unforgettable.  There was so much description, it almost overwhelmed the plot.<br />In fact, there isn't much plot.  This is a story of a mute, facially-scarred amnesiac who sets out on a journey to find someone with the right kind of magic to heal her.  The plot is the journey, or the journey is the plot.  Along the way, the ill-made mute interacts with flying horses, flying galleons, an Irishman straight out of a Mike and Pat joke, a treasure cave, unstorms, pirates, King's rangers, and eldritch wights.  There is plenty of drama, and wondrous sights to see along the way.  Read slowly and savor the rich text.  Journey's end is only partially satisfying, but a wonderful sequel has already been published--&quot;The Lady of the Sorrows&quot;---I've already read it and it's even better than &quot;The Ill-Made Mute.&quot;  The third book of the trilogy, &quot;The Battle of Evernight,&quot; is promised for April, 2003.<br />It's going to be a long wait.  Now that I've read the first two books of the Bitterbynde trilogy, it will be very hard to go back to the generic, Robert Jordan, ya da-da, ya da-da, 'the hero slays the dragon, saves the maiden, and finds the ring of eternal spin-offs' type fantasy.	2002-06-04

He was the first recipient of the George E. Burch Fellowship in Theoretic Medicine and Affiliated Sciences.  He conceived a new discipline called 'evolutionary epidemiology,' and \\"Evolution of Infectious Disease (1994)\\" is widely acknowledged as the watershed event for the emergence of this discipline, although I haven't yet seen many references to it (\\"Parasite Rex\\" by Carl Zimmer is an exception).  This is a shame, because \\"Evolution of Infectious Disease\\" explains many medical mysteries, such as why people with multiple sex partners tend to harbor a more virulent version of AIDS, and why the Great Flu Pandemic of 1918 killed so many people (20 to 100 million).<br />'Darwinian medicine' is the science of trying to find evolutionary explanations for vulnerabilities to disease.  A pathogen can survive in a population, explains Ewald, only if it can easily transmit its progeny from one host to another. One way to do this is to take a long time to disable a host, giving him plenty of time to come into contact with other potential victims.  This would cause selection for a beneficial form of the disease.  If the disease can pass quickly from one host to another, it will select for virulence in order to infect more hosts.  Therefore if host-to-host passage can be delayed (by screened windows in the case of malaria), the disease will select for longevity---it makes no evolutionary sense to kill a host before the disease can be passed on.<br />Some diseases such as Ebola Fever kill the host too quickly, which is why Ewald believes this particular infection will not become pandemic.  On the other hand the HTLV (human T Cell leukemia/lymphoma) viruses might very well increase in virulence and cause another pandemic like AIDS, since they are hosted and transmitted very much like AIDS.  Ewald turns many of my preconceptions about disease upside down in this book, which is one reason why it is so fascinating.<br />If you have any interest at all in epidemiology or any concern about our 'once and future' plagues, read this book!<br />This author has also written \\"Plague Time: How Stealth Infections Cause Cancers, Heart Disease, and Other Deadly Ailments.\\"you have any interest at all in epidemiology or any concern about our 'once and future' plagues, read this book!<br />This author has also written \\"Plague Time: How Stealth Infections Cause Cancers, Heart Disease, and Other Deadly Ailments.\\"	2002-05-24

He then compares it to the Messina earthquake (1908), and asks why there were so many more casualties in the Messina quake (only a 33% - 45% survival rate as compared to San Francisco's 99.8% survival rate).  This question leads to a discussion of the strengths of materials---how well they perform when deformed by tension, compression, shear, and torsion.  In San Francisco, the houses were built of wood, which will bend and twist and allow its occupants time to escape during a quake.  The houses in Messina were built of stone.  &quot;It is this plastic behavior of wood (versus stone) that explains the dramatic difference in survival rates in the San Francisco and Messina earthquakes of 1906 and 1908.&quot;<br />There's lots of physics (and some biology, archeology, and sociology) in 'Perils' but it is all very clear and palatable.  In fact, this book would make a good overview of science for high school students.  It's got stories of volcanoes, plagues, earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, asteroids, and poisonous lakes to hold the students' interest.  The clear physical explanations of, for example, why some boats will float during a tsunami and others will turn turtle, are an excellent foundation for further explorations into the worlds of science.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in how we've managed to survive and even thrive on the surface of such a restless planet.  It is an excellent summary of the science necessary to understand many of the Earth's natural catastrophes.	2002-05-20

His books really read like they're written from a child's perspective.  Robert Westall writes in the same genre (YA ghost story) and \\"Ghost Abbey\\" is told from the perspective of a twelve-year-old girl, but without the whimsy that is Bellairs's hallmark.  It's a book written by an adult for children.  On the positive side, the story is more complex than, say, Bellairs's \\"The Vengeance of the Witch-finder.\\"  In fact, \\"Ghost Abbey\\" reminds me of Shirley Jackson's \\"The Haunting of Hill House\\" more than anything by Bellairs.  Westall ends his work on a more positive note, but it's still eerily similar to Jackson's ending.<br />A young teen-ager, Maggi takes care of her widowed father and her two cub-scout-aged twin brothers.  There is also a slovenly housekeeper with the notion of marrying Maggi's father, who has 'kind, lost, blue eyes.'  When a letter arrives asking Maggi's father, who is a master builder, to come fix up an old abbey, Maggi at least jumps at the opportunity to get away from the slovenly housekeeper and give her twin brothers a bit of a vacation in Chesire.  She talks her father into going, and they all pile into the old Ford Transit van.  Due to several mechanical breakdowns, the van doesn't arrive at the abbey until after dark.<br />Let the spookiness begin!  Westall really knows how to build an atmosphere, and although Maggi knows she shouldn't be wandering around in the dark, she absolutely has to find the loo before she can go to sleep.<br />The author does a great job of combining the details of everyday life in an old abbey---how Maggi's father sets them up so that they can take hot baths; how Maggi manages her household allowance (the family eats lots of chips); how the lady of the Abbey gradually becomes part of the family---but Westall never lets his readers forget where they are or who else might be sharing the abbey with them.<br />Although \\"Ghost Abbey\\" is a very family-oriented story, Westall has also written collections of ghost stories for the adult market (he's especially fond of feline ghost stories).e abbey with them.<br />Although \\"Ghost Abbey\\" is a very family-oriented story, Westall has also written collections of ghost stories for the adult market (he's especially fond of feline ghost stories).	2002-05-14

Far better to be in Rome in the spring, even though Jean and Jacqueline are underground in various catacombs too much of the time.  At least, they didn't have to spend any subsurface hours in the Cloaca Maximus, which still carries somewhere around one million cubic meters of waste per day.<br />Anyway, this book is more focused on the early Christians, rather than the pagan Romans.  There are some fascinating archeological inquiries into the burial sites of Saints Peter and Paul, and of course there is the brooding, claustrophobic atmosphere of underground Rome itself---an important part of this mystery.<br />'Sinner' moves right along and there's no point in warning the heroine to stay out of the catacombs.

It takes place in 1951, mainly at the Barnavelt mansion in England.<br />This book can be read in conjunction with \\"The Ghost in the Mirror\\" which takes place simultaneously with `Witch-Finder' and stars Lewis Barnavelt's friends, Rose Rita Pottinger and Mrs. Florence Zimmermann.<br />When orphaned Lewis Barnavelt, now age thirteen, and his Uncle Jonathan go on vacation in Europe, they drop in on their English cousin Pelham, who owns the ancestral Barnavelt Manor.  The housekeeper's son Bertie, who is blind, takes Lewis on a tour of the old mansion and grounds.<br />Lewis is especially interested in the maze, which he has read about but never seen, and his new friend Bertie shows him the trick of reaching its center.  From the description given in `Witch-Finder,' it was probably a hedged labyrinth of the sort that became fashionable in the late sixteenth century (see M.R. James's story, \\"Mr. Humphreys and His Inheritance\\" for a similar tale of a maze and the awfulness at its center).<br />All is well, until Lewis discovers an old map of the maze with what might be a treasure in the center.  He sets out on a midnight excursion, accompanied by Bertie, to the hidden heart of the maze.<br />Instead of treasure, Lewis accidentally unleashes a demon that summons the ghost of the witch-finder Malachiah Pruitt, three hundred years dead.  Lewis and Bertie barely escape the maze with their lives.<br />Back during Cromwell's reign in England, Malachiah Pruitt had accused one of Lewis's ancestors of witchery and tried to have him burned at the stake. Now Pruitt's ghost has been set free by Lewis and Bertie.<br />`Witch-Finder' is full of deliciously spooky occurrences, and I enjoyed the `Sherlock and Watson' role-playing of the two boys as they try to solve the horrible predicament they've gotten themselves into (along with everyone else in the mansion).and I enjoyed the `Sherlock and Watson' role-playing of the two boys as they try to solve the horrible predicament they've gotten themselves into (along with everyone else in the mansion).	2002-05-10

Maybe their lawyers really are zombies (some excellent characterization here), and the &quot;Ankh-Morpork Times&quot; really has a teetotalling vampire as its press photographer---a vampire who turns to dust every time his flash goes off, and has to be revived with a piece of blutw&uuml;rst, a bit of dog meat, a drop of blood---whatever is at hand.  Hopefully not blood since our Vampire, Otto has given up the b-word.<br />There is also a pair of very nasty villains named Mr. Pin and Mr. Tulip, who assume the disguises of Brother Upon-Which-the-Angels-Dance Pin and Sister Jennifer of The Little Flowers of Perpetual Annoyance in order to pursue a dog who might blab out what really happened on the morning when Ankh-Morpork's First Patrician was kidnapped by said villains.<br />(Apology to readers:  Pratchett really does induce long, complicated sentences from reviewers who are trying to describe his plots).<br />So, forget the plot.  Read this book because it's hysterically funny and because you can be the first to entertain your friends with songs from the Vampires' Temperance Union.	2002-05-09

It's an incredible collection of stories bound together by the thread of `chemistry in nature.'  In fact, one of the stories concerns threads---the ancient Romans used to weave a sheer fabric called `linen mist' from the byssal threads of a large mollusk known as the noble pen shell (`Pinna nobilis').<br />Many of the lessons in chemical ecology concern ants and their sophisticated use of biochemicals to take slaves, grow crops, and manufacture antibiotics.  In another chapter called \\"Real-World Complexities,\\" the author maps the annual fluctuation of Lyme disease as dependent on the interaction of deer, bacteria-carrying deer ticks, mice, oaks, and gypsy moths.  If only we could learn from these chemical interactions, before we destroy their ecology.<br />The author gives tantalizing glimpses at antibiotics, extremophile enzymes that don't break down when used as catalysts, fishing nets that are made out of spider webs, and many other ways we could capitalize on ecology if we took the time to learn from it.<br />There are many good science project ideas in \\"Tales of Chemistry in Nature.\\"  The book can be profitably read by adults and young adults.  For adults already advancing down their chosen career paths, this book is a fascinating look at what the biochemists and ecologists may be learning from nature.	2002-05-07

Duncan is a `show' not `tell' author.  If the spell that binds an apprentice swordsman to his blade is strong enough to kill, then by golly Duncan includes a scene where an apprentice dies.<br />The king to whom the hero, Durandel is eventually apprenticed is the written image of Henry VIII---from popular, overbearing youth to fat, ulcerous old age.  He even has an unloved daughter who will succeed him when he dies.<br />If he dies.  Within the plot, there is a carefully-worked-out core of sorcery.  The author's magicks aren't just an overlay on the plot---they drive the action from beginning to end.<br />Once Durandel becomes a King's Blade, he is caught up in court politics, and earns a reputation as the only man who will say `no' to the King.  For his pains, Durandel is sent on a mission to a faraway country where a King's Blade went missing several years past.<br />Durandel reaches Samarinda (think Samarkand) with a minimum of travelogue, even though the journey takes two years through seas, mountains, deserts, wild beasts, hostile tribes, shipwrecks, scorpions, dysentery, and forest fires (none of which is relevant to the plot).  He completes part of his mission, makes a deadly enemy, and loses a good friend.  Then it's another briskly-handled two years back to King Ambrose.  We can imagine the sights along the way from other fantasies (way too common) with long, pointless sections of travelogue.<br />What Durandel and his companions discovered in a monastery in Samarinda is the centerpiece to this book's climactic ending.<br />Subtract one star for overall goriness (only to be expected from a series called \\"The King's Blades\\"), and the lack of strong female characters (there is one, but she's the one plot element that seems to be tacked on as an afterthought).\\"), and the lack of strong female characters (there is one, but she's the one plot element that seems to be tacked on as an afterthought).	2002-04-25

The year is 1948, and New Zebedee bears a strong resemblance to Marshall, Michigan, where the author was born--- The Cronin House and the GAR (Grand Army of the Republic) Hall still stand in Marshall, just as their counterparts do in New Zebedee.<br />\\"The House with a Clock in its Walls\\" is a whimsical horror tale involving a deceased wizard's scheme to end the world. The book was illustrated by Edward Gorey (speaking of whimsical horror), and was at one time transformed into a made-for-tv movie for children.<br />So far from what I've read of Bellairs, his characters tend to be elderly eccentrics, or ordinary children (no superkids, here).  Lewis is resourceful, but with a child's fears and limitations.  Most especially, he is afraid that his uncle won't like him, that the kids in his new school will make fun of him, and that he'll never have a friend.  His uncle Jonathan and neighbor, Mrs. Zimmerman are skilled in magic, and are very likeable.  They perform magic tricks for Lewis and make him chocolate chip cookies and coca, and generally treat him as a small adult.  The one thing Uncle Jonathan is reluctant to talk about is the ticking noise within his old house.<br />Lewis discovers that his uncle makes midnight excursions throughout the house, stopping and restarting all of the old clocks.  He slowly gets involved in the mystery of the undiscovered clock.  The wizardly Izzard couple who used to live in the house are both dead, but what did they leave behind and why?<br />There are some genuinely frightening scenes in \\"The House with a Clock in its Walls\\"---most especially when Lewis tries to impress a new friend by stealing one of his uncle's magic books and taking it to the graveyard at midnight on Halloween---but I don't want to spoil the story for you (Hint:  there's a scene straight out of \\"Count Magnus\\" by M.R.

Before reading this book, I had the vague notion that Seabiscuit was a gelding who won a big match race against War Admiral.<br />Okay, I thought, so Seabiscuit got lucky.  War Admiral was a triple-crown winner, and even War Admiral's sire, the immortal Man O'War lost one race.<br />I could not have been more wrong (for one thing, Seabiscuit was a stallion).<br />In some respects, Seabiscuit was like the Depression-era survivors who filled the stands to watch him:  hard-bitten, tough, struggling to win in spite of bad knees and the weight that race-track stewards piled onto his back when he began to win.  The bay colt started thirty-five (!) times at age two, and evidently impressed no-one as he could have been claimed for $2,500 more than once.  At age three, when trainer Smith bought him for his new owner, Buick-dealer Charles Howard, he paid $7,000 for a colt whose, \\"... body, built low to the ground, had all the properties of a cinder block.  Where Hard Tack [Seabiscuit's sire] had been tall, sleek, tapered, every line suggesting motion, his son was blunt, coarse, rectangular, stationary.  He had a sad little tail, barely long enough to brush his hocks.  His stubby legs were a study in unsound construction with squarish, asymmetrical `baseball glove' knees that didn't quite straighten all the way, leaving him in a permanent semicrouch.\\"<br />Paging through old issues of \\"The Blood-Horse,\\" I see that Seabiscuit at age three was described as `useful.'<br />It was not until the colt turned four that his rags-to-riches fairy tale truly began.  At four and five he was one of the best handicap horses in training, although he lost the Santa Anita Handicap (the `Big Cap') twice in close finishes---and this was the one race that his owner, Charles Howard had set his heart on winning.<br />The fairy tale might have ended when Seabiscuit turned six---he injured his knee and was retired to stud.

Easy Goer could do no wrong.  Sunday Silence, racing out west, under the radar of the Eastern press, made no impression at all as a two-year-old.<br />While the paths of the now-three-year-old Sunday Silence and Easy Goer would not officially cross until the Kentucky Derby, ABC Sports telecast two of their derby prep races on April 8, 1989.<br />\\"Easy Goer was simply brilliant in his race, the Gotham Stakes from New York's Aqueduct racetrack....he [bounded] away from the field to win by thirteen lengths.  His final time of 1:32 2/5 was just one-fifth of a second off the world record for a mile, set in 1968 by the great champion Dr. Fager.\\"<br />Sunday Silence ran a good race, too, winning the Santa Anita Derby by eleven lengths and coming within three-fifths of a second of the stakes record set by Lucky Debonair in 1965.<br />Easy Goer's trainer, Shug McGaughey wasn't so much worried about the cow-hocked black's running style as he was about Sunday Silence's trainer:  the ex-marine, hall-of-fame trainer, Charlie Wittingham, the Bald Eagle.  \\"I sure wish somebody else besides Charlie Whittingham was training that horse,\\" McGaughey said.<br />He was right to be worried.  The Bald Eagle was a master at bringing a horse up to a classic race.<br />Easy Goer was the favorite to win both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness, but Sunday Silence was all alone at the wire for the Derby.  He went on to win the Preakness by a nose, and was finally made the favorite for the third race in the Triple Crown series:  the Belmont.  The bettors were wrong, again.  Easy Goer was on his home track and he relished the mile-and-a-half distance, winning the Belmont by eight lengths.  The two rivals would race together one more time in 1989 to determine who was going to be Horse of the Year.<br />Luckily, the Breeders' Cup races weren't held at Belmont that year, or things might have turned out differently.  The Gulfstream track had relatively tight turns, favoring a nimble horse like Sunday Silence over the long-striding, slow-to-turn Easy Goer.  Once again, Easy Goer was hammered down to 1-2 favoritism by the bettors (he was a beautiful horse).  Once again, Sunday Silence outmaneuvered his rival on the track and won by a desperate neck.<br />Sunday Silence was voted Horse of the Year.<br />Both horses were expected to renew their rivalry as four-year-olds, but both sustained injuries and had to be retired to stud.  Easy Goer was bedded down in the same stall at Claiborne where Secretariat had held court, and he attracted the cream of the regally bred mares.  Unfortunately, he only produced four crops of foals before his premature death, with only three grade one winners among them.<br />On the other hand, no one was interested in breeding to a cow-hocked son of Halo, no matter how well he had run, so Arthur Hancock sold Sunday Silence to Zenya Yoshida of the Shadai Stables in Japan.  Sunday Silence has been doing extremely well at stud in Japan, breeding champion after champion.  This spring, a contingent of his yearlings sold for an average of more than $700,000 apiece in Australia.<br />Handsome is as handsome does, as my grandmother used to say.<br />Ray Paulick also tells the interesting story of how Arthur Hancock, who was written out of his father's will as owner of Claibourne Farm, picked himself back up and made his own Stone Farm an outstanding success.<br />Another story related to the success of Sunday Silence is that of his jockey Pat Valenzuela, a gifted athlete whose career was side-tracked on numerous occasions because of drugs.  He is making what is hopefully his final comeback from drugs in 2002, and has already won a few stakes for the trainers who still put their trust in him.ng to be Horse of the Year.<br />Luckily, the Breeders' Cup races weren't held at Belmont that year, or things might have turned out differently.

The psyche of suicide bombers is explored, and the men who send them to their deaths are interviewed.  The author also interviews actual terrorists (and/or their close associates) who perpetrated many acts of murder and destruction within the last two decades<br />The cultures of violence that the author treats in depth are:  \\"Soldiers for Christ;\\" \\"Zion Betrayed (Judaism);\\" \\"Islam's `Neglected Duty';\\" \\"The Sword of Sikhism;\\" and \\"Armageddon in a Tokyo Subway (Buddhism).\\"<br />In the last five chapters of this book, the author attempts to explain the logic of religious violence.  He maintains a very non-judgmental, even tone even when explaining the reasons behind the grisliest acts of terror.  It was spooky to find myself nodding my head at Juergensmeyer's explanations of the terrorists' logic; `okay, so that's why they did it.'  Taking a teen-ager who feels he has nothing to live for and everything to die for, and turning him into a human bomb seems like a relatively simple task for a religious zealot, now that I've read this book.<br />Fascinating and extremely frightening.<br />In one of the most interesting and hopeful parts of the book, Juergensmeyer turns his thesis on its head, and suggests that, \\"the entrance of religion into public life would help to leaven these negative influences [the use of terror to promote a religion].  Several thoughtful observers of Western society have suggested that indeed it might---if religion could enter the public arena in an undogmatic and unobtrusive way....what religion provides society is not just high-mindedness, but also a concern with the quality of life---a goal more ennobling than the simple accretion of power and possessions.\\"<br />This book could change all of our lives, if we let it.goal more ennobling than the simple accretion of power and possessions.\\"<br />This book could change all of our lives, if we let it.	2002-04-08

His Derby Watch is a feature of the 'Blood Horse' web site, although it hasn't done me much good, so far on the 2002 Derby trail (I'm currently ranked 12,123 out of a field of 17,187 players in the Kentucky Derby Fantasy Challenge).<br />At any rate, Haskin writes descriptions of the current Derby prospects, like:<br />'Hey, nothing surprises us anymore this year. So, we've got a Derby contender who changes leads four times, is pulled to the inside rail twice as if it were magnetized, and runs with his tongue flapping out of his mouth. So what? We threw the book away this year a long time ago.'<br />No, don't throw away the book---at least not if it's Haskin's 'Horse Racing's Holy Grail.' By nature, the book is more generic than his online column---he has to talk about previous Derby contenders, and their jockeys and trainers, not the current lot. However, 'Grail' is quite informative on what bloodlines to look for (the infamous Dosage index), which jockeys are best fitted to ride say, a horse that likes to come from behind, and which trainers are gearing up to win the Derby as soon as the yearling sales are history.<br />His favorite trainers are multiple Derby winners, and he calls them the 'Derby Dynamos.' They are D. Wayne Lukas, Nick Zito, and Bob Baffert. You could do well if you picked one of these trainers, and bet on his horse (or horses)---although 2002 seems to be an exception to the rule---none of the 'Derby Dynamos' has what currently looks like a Derby horse unless you planning to pick a longshot like Baffert's Danthebluegrassman.<br />'Grail' is a fun book to read if you have any interest at all on watching or betting on the Kentucky Derby. Haskin writes very knowledgeably the ten rules on how NOT to pick a horse, which jockeys are the most likely to win (hold off betting until Jerry Bailey, Chris McCarron, and Corey Nakatani have finally settled on their Derby mounts), and how (if all else fails) to appease the fickle Derby gods (in part, it involves feeding senior press correspondents).Derby mounts), and how (if all else fails) to appease the fickle Derby gods (in part, it involves feeding senior press correspondents).	2002-03-28

And there's no `payable when the foal stands and nurses' clause in his contract, either.<br />\\"Stud\\" is a two-year labor of love by \\"New Yorker\\" staff writer, Kevin Conley who became intrigued by the amount of money that a Thoroughbred stallion could earn after retiring from the racetrack.  This is an exuberant, stylishly-written book that will tell you everything you wanted to know about what goes on in the breeding shed, but were afraid to ask.<br />I also learned some things I didn't know I wanted to know, like the diameter of Seattle Slew's testicles---this is a book for horse-lovers who have already been through sex education class.<br />The author spends some time at the Keeneland sales in Lexington, Kentucky, where the `Doobie Brothers' (four sheiks from the royal family of Dubai) duke it out with the `boys' (Ireland's Coolmore Stud) for the most expensive yearlings in the sale (often  Storm Cat progeny).  Conley doesn't neglect the smaller breeders who make a profit by buying and breeding inexpensive mares with good blood-lines, and then selling their yearlings and two-year-olds for a profit. (There is a story in last week's \\"Thoroughbred Times\\" about a filly \\"who clearly did not have enough pedigree to shoot for the stars,\\" yet was sold for $1.9 million at Barretts March sale because she showed that she could run.)<br />Finally, Conley details the differences between a `natural' cover (Thoroughbreds), artificial insemination (A.I.) techniques (Standardbreds), and pasture breeding (semi-feral Shetland ponies). Speaking for myself, I wouldn't exactly use the word `natural' after reading that it usually takes five or six people plus a stallion, plus a twitched and hobbled mare to complete the breeding process.

This whole book is structured like a course in logic, i.e. IF A = B, THEN C. If youd really like to follow the youth-to-(almost)death biography of someone who acquires a misenchanted sword, and how the spells on the sword logically affected his (almost) entire life, this is the fantasy for you.<br />Rules are rules, whether dealing with spells or computer logic gates, and the author leaves the misenchanted sword stuck to his hero, Valders hand for thirteen days because of the rule that Valder has to kill another male warrior before he can sheath it.<br />What is the logical profession for Valder after he acquires his new sword?  He is already a soldier, but he cant very well employ the misenchanted sword on the battlefield because of rule #2: he has to sheath it between killings.<br />So his superiors force him to become an assassin, which is logical, but Valder doesnt really care for killing men---especially after dispatching eighty or so of them.<br />Which leads to rule #3:  after Valder has killed a hundred men, the sword will turn on him.  Hell die, and his assassin will then have to kill ninety-nine men with the sword before the same thing happens to him.  The total of men killed by the sword = 100 + 99 +98 +97.+1 before the misenchantment finally wears off.<br />Luckily the war ends (with all of the real action such as the last battle between the gods and demons taking place off stage) before Valder kills his magic hundred men.  Now he is stuck with rule #4:  he will age normally, but he cant die except by the sword, and then only after he kills his hundredth man.<br />The bulk of this book (it seemed very bulky to me) is taken up by Valders adventures after he leaves the army.  The books beginning and end were quite interesting, i.e. the story of how he acquired the misenchanted sword and then the sequel of how, as an old man, he tries to break its spell.

I imagine \\"Volcanoes\\" is used as a freshman introductory course, as there is very little geological mumbo-jumbo about say, the differences between a reverse dip slip fault and a left lateral strike slip fault.<br />In fact, I wish I'd read this book first, before \\"The Encyclopedia of Earthquakes and Volcanoes\\" or \\"Perils of a Restless Planet.\\"  Its definitions are clear and easy to remember, and usually accompanied by a photograph or drawing.  One of my favorites is a photograph of the San Andreas fault, which is a right lateral fault, \\"so called because for a person standing on either plate, the sense of motion on the opposite side is to the right.\\"<br />Now, at least I understand the difference between left and right lateral faults.  Dip slips and strike slips will have to wait for another book for geometrically-challenged folks like me---I can't just close my eyes and visualize a three dimensional object, unless prompted by very clear diagrams and text.<br />This book is an introduction to the geology of volcanoes (plate tectonics, the formation of mineral deposits, etc.), rather than a series of stories about dangerous volcanoes, although there is an appendix on \\"The World's 101 Most Notorious Volcanoes.\\"  One of my favorite chapters, \\"Volcanic Power\\" has little to do with volcanoes as we usually picture them, e.g. an erupting strato-volcano like Mt. Vesuvius.  It is about geothermal energy, and why it might play an important role in our future:<br />\\"Even though geothermal power is still an infant and largely unproved industry, its potential makes it worth serious effort and investment.  The U.S. Geological Survey in a recent assessment of potential geothermal energy resources in the fifty states to depths of 10 kilometers listed the following estimates:  hydrothermal reservoirs, 12 x 10(to the 21st power) joules, or about 2 times the energy in the world's oil reserves; hot dry rock, 32 x 10(to the 24th power) joules, or about 6000 times the energy in the world's oil reserves; magma reservoirs, 4 x 10(to the 23rd power) joules, or about 80 times the energy in the world's oil reserves.\\"<br />In light of recent history, perhaps we should be investing more research in our geothermal resources.<br />Read \\"Volcanoes\\" if you have any interest at all in geology.  It would even make a good high school text, although it is a bit dated:  my copy was published in 1981, but the only thing that struck me as out-of-date was a diagram of the Earth's crustal plates---the Juan de Fuca plate was labeled `Gorda Plate,' although everything was pretty much in the right place.

Lewis said in his book, \\"The Problem of Pain\\":  \\"Pain as God's megaphone is a terrible instrument.\\"  It gets our attention and warns us of danger.  Unfortunately, some doctors don't listen to that same megaphone when treating their patients.<br />According to a recent \\"New York Times\\" article, \\"More than a third of seriously ill patients who requested that doctors ease their discomfort instead of prolonging their lives appear to have had their wishes overlooked, a new study [published in the \\"Journal of the American Geriatrics Society\\"] reports\\".<br />\\"Why We Hurt\\" claims that, \\"three of four cancer patients will die in poorly controlled pain, and the percentage climbs higher still for those succumbing to malignancies with a talent for invading bones and nerves, including cancers of the breast, prostate, rectum, pancreas, and cervix.\\"<br />This must be disquieting information for people who are suffering from terminal illnesses like cancer or AIDS, especially since doctors already tend to undermedicate for pain---think of all of the criminal and civil lawsuits pending for over-prescription of OxyContin, and it is easy to understand why some doctors avoid the heavy-duty painkillers or their prolonged usage.<br />Dr. Vertosick has treated some nightmarish pain problems during his career as a neurosurgeon.  This book contains many case histories of patients in agony, connected by the overarching theme of why it is necessary to feel pain.  Each story explains why we are connected in such a hurtful way to our inner and outer worlds.<br />According to Dr. Vertosick, \\"when stripped of pain's discipline, we neglect our bodies until they become battered beyond recognition....The hands and feet of longtime diabetics and paralytics...become deformed and covered with pressure sores.  Patients with trigeminal neuralgia who have their corneas rendered numb by alcohol nerve blocks will ultimately go blind from unchecked corneal scarring.\\"<br />There is also the sad story of Jimmy, the boy who was born without the ability to feel pain.<br />\\"Why We Hurt\\" is a book that both teaches and fascinates.  I learned that neurosurgery can help at least some people (including cancer patients) who suffer from intractable pain.  There are only a couple of areas where I found Dr. Vertosick to be overly optimistic.  One concerns the efficacy of back surgery.  Read this book, and then read the prologue to Dr. Jerome Groopman's \\"Second Opinions\\" for an example of where back surgery (spinal fusion) worsened the patient's condition.  My own neurologist has told me that 60% of patients who underwent back surgery felt that it didn't do any good.<br />The question of whether newborn babies feel pain is another gray area where this author tends toward optimism.  He feels that they are not yet fully connected to sensations of pain.  However, I've read research to the contrary:  newborn infants who have been operated on without anesthesia not only feel pain, they remember it.<br />These two small quibbles aside, please read this book.  You may someday have to make choices on pain control, and this is a good place to start learning what those choices may entail, and (if it's any comfort) why it is `natural,' i.e. in accordance with human evolution, that you feel the way you do.Jimmy, the boy who was born without the ability to feel pain.<br />\\"Why We Hurt\\" is a book that both teaches and fascinates.

A few gained the ability to lift heavy objects (except for the plot) by thinking about them.  The hero, Hanner becomes one of the `lifters.'  He is also a self-described palace parasite, a humorless young man, but nevertheless willing to take charge and do something productive during the night of madness.  Hanner tries to figure out why some people were turned into warlocks on that night, and why others simply disappeared, but he approaches the mystery with the well-meaning plod of a Watson whose Holmes went over the falls at Reichenbach.<br />The mystery never is solved, so I'm assuming there is going to be a sequel to this fantasy.<br />The magic in \\"Night of Madness\\" is interesting, but it lacks the inspired fizz produced by, say a Neil Gaiman, a John Bellairs, or a Patricia McKillip.  In one of wittiest scenes, a flying telephone lands in the sorceress Ithinia's backyard, and her gargoyles try to frighten it away:<br />\\"Old Rocky and Glitter were the two creatures still guarding it [the phone].  Ithinia glanced at Old Rocky's niche, on the south-west corner of the house.<br />\\"'Did you see where it came from?'<br />\\"'No, mistress.  It came down out of the sun while we were meditating.'<br />\\"'You were sleeping, not meditating,' Ithinia said.  `I've told you not to try to fool me. Stone should sleep---it's nothing to hide.\\"<br />\\"'Yes, Mistress,\\" the gargoyle said, abashed.'<br />\\"'It called my name?  Did it say anything else?'<br />\\"'It said it needed to speak with you.'\\"<br />Ha ha ha.  Clunk.<br />Most of the dialogue comes in the form of big, chunky explanatory text, in order to elucidate the rules of Ethsharian magic, what a sorcerer may or may not do, what a witch may or may not do, etc. etc.  By their very nature, sequels suffer from a degree of explanatory text, but this rules-bound fantasy takes it to an extreme.  If you've already read one of the prequels to \\"Night of Madness\\" you'll be able to skip through whole pages of this book.<br />In fact, you might want to give the entire book a pass.o, what a witch may or may not do, etc. etc.  By their very nature, sequels suffer from a degree of explanatory text, but this rules-bound fantasy takes it to an extreme.

Especially since her characters are embedded like jewels in the cities of Ombria and Shadow Ombria (think of an ancient Italian city like Ravenna, saturated in sorcery, where every shadow may reflect a distant age, a different ruler).<br />Careful reading reveals the intricacies of the plot that twines around the characters of a bastard artist-prince, the former ruler's mistress, the young prince of Ombria, and his evil regent, Domina Pearl.  There is also a young girl named Mag, who is not even sure she is human, and a powerful sorceress named Faey, who lives in the shadows and sends Mag on the oddest errands:<br />\\"She [Mag] bought a lamb's heart at the butcher's.  She waited at a familiar doorway for goats' eyes and candles made of goat fat.  At a small shop with dusty windows and an ancient apothecary sign, she picked up powdered bone and extractions from strange, fleshy plants that had been diverted from Domina Pearl's pirate ships.  For the cook, she bought violets.  At the brewer's, she traded silver for quicksilver, and a crock of Faey's favorite ale.\\"<br />Mag ingratiates herself into the plot:  small drops of quicksilver against the dark palette of two powerful magicians---Mag's mistress and Domina Pearl---who vie for control of the true Ombria.  The story line may well remind readers of \\"Song for the Basilisk,\\" where the Basilisk's daughter intrudes between her father's magic and that of a musician-sorcerer's.  I think `Ombria' has the edge over `Basilisk' in that Domina Pearl's motives are easier to understand, and she is more briskly evil than was the Basilisk-prince.<br />As always, Kinuko Craft's cover art is a match for McKillip's intoxicating prose.	2002-03-16

The lighthouses described in the book are located on the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts, and on the Great Lakes, with one on the Gulf of Mexico thrown in to make an `even' thirteen stories.<br />The lighthouses and their keepers are meticulously described with some not-so-scary ghosts added as an extra tourist attraction.  There are also black-and-white photographs of each lighthouse and/or the keepers' residence, along with directions on how to find them.<br />Some of the lighthouses or keepers' dwellings are bed-and-breakfasts, so you can check out the phantoms during an overnight stay if you so desire.  All of the stories are supposedly authentic, so take a flashlight with you in case the big beacon fails---or turns on when it shouldn't (see the story of the Old Presque Isle Light Station on Lake Huron.)<br />The saddest story involves the history of the St. Augustine Lighthouse in Florida, where there are a multiplicity of spirits to choose from, including one who smokes cigars.  The smallest phantom might be the daughter of a nineteenth-century lighthouse keeper: she was killed along with two of her friends, when a tram used to haul supplies from the dock to a construction site, \\"suddenly broke loose, hurtled down the rails, and dumped the three girls into the water.  All of them drowned.\\"	2002-03-12

In between, all geophysical phenomena associated with earthquakes and volcanoes are covered alphabetically, including anecdotes on many individual eruptions or shakings, e.g. the Kobe earthquake in Japan.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading the \\"Encyclopedia of Earthquakes and Volcanoes\\" but thought it must be a work in progress (I have the new edition) as there were many typos and one astronomical quibble:<br /><br />* \\"Io is the hottest place in the solar system outside the sun (p. 105)\\"---actually I believe that honor belongs to Venus.  Io's average surface temperature is 130 K whereas the surface of Venus averages 740 K (hotter even than Mercury).<br /><br />Another interesting oddity concerning earthquakes, is that the authors tend to favor the Mercalli Scale, which is based on ordinary human observations, rather than the Moment magnitude.<br /><br />Not all of the black-and-white photographs are dated, and the cover photograph of a volcanic eruption is not identified (although a friend of mine from Oregon swears it is Mt. St. Helens).  Ideally, a newer edition of this book will label all of the photographs, and perhaps include a few in color.<br /><br />All quibbling aside, this is an interesting book that fills a useful niche. It will definitely remain in my reference library.<br /><br />\\"Appendix B\\" which includes \\"Eyewitness Accounts of Major Eruptions and Quakes\\" is absolutely fascinating, and it alone is worth the price of the book.	2002-03-10

Tia's body slumps and withers with age as everyone around her remains young and beautiful.  Then her lover of fifty years past joins her on an underwater archeology expedition to the drowned islands of Hawaii.<br />The other members of the crew either hate or fear Tia because she is undergoing a disgusting metamorphosis that they no longer have to experience, although they can still die by accident.  Her former lover takes up with her again because he is attracted by the thing he fears the most:  death and dying.  When Tia discovers why he has made up to her, she boots him back out of her life.<br />Most of Tia's life is told in flashbacks:  before and after she discovers that the immortality treatment doesn't work for her.  Once she realizes her fate, she speeds through denial, stays angry through most of the book, bargains with her fate by learning all she can about the immortality process, goes through a deep depression when her one true love decides to take off for Pluto.  If she goes with him, she'll be the only member of the crew who will age during their long journey.  Instead she locks herself away from the rest of humanity on a solar monitoring station for a few years, almost goes mad, and finally returns to Earth in a state of semi-acceptance.<br />One thing is for sure---she isn't going to take any more crap from the Immortals.<br />Deep under the waters of the Pacific, Tia discovers a powerful process that the Immortals had lost.  If she can learn how to use it before her shipmates slaughter her, she will gain the ability to transform herself and her world.<br />\\"Islands\\" is an interesting psychological study as well as future science with all the trimmings.	2002-03-09

Inspiration for new products could come from many sources.  For instance, a champagne cork in the eye led to the invention of the intermittent windshield wiper.<br />The inventor, Robert Kearns is still in the process of suing the big auto manufacturers for stealing his patent.  Chrysler and Ford have already paid off, but there are still GM, Saab, Honda, Rolls-Royce, Mercedes, etc. that refuse to acknowledge their theft.  Mr. Kearns plans to spend the rest of his life in court, and I hope he keeps winning.  As the author of \\"The House of Invention\\" puts it:<br />\\"In the annals of technology, tales of corporate abuse are strewn across the American century like so many highway accidents, and in a sense, Kearns has fought for the many inventors who ended up as roadkill.\\"<br />Nikola Tesla did not profit from his invention of the alternating-current electrical motor as much as did the company that was to become General Electric.  Eventually GE, under the leadership of J. P. Morgan also did in Thomas Edison and his championship of direct current (although one does not usually think of the Wizard of Menlo Park as roadkill.)<br /><br />Then there was George Squier, inventor of the `wire-wireless' technology that allowed radio signals to travel through a telephone line (the precursor to `Muzak'), who was robbed of his patent by AT&amp;T.<br />Overall, this is a very light-hearted, irreverent book about inventors, but it does have its serious moments.  In addition to the numerous inventors who ended up cheated and broke, there is also the graphic story of how alternating current triumphed over direct current as the preferred method of capital punishment.<br />My favorite stories involve the invention of the pencil by the ancient Egyptians, who also came up with the first door lock, and the invention of the flat-bottomed paper bag by the American, Margaret Knight.  The author tells tales of many eccentrics, including the man who invented Vaseline and then ate a spoonful of the stuff daily for the rest of his life (he died in his nineties).<br />Here was someone who truly believed in his product.tells tales of many eccentrics, including the man who invented Vaseline and then ate a spoonful of the stuff daily for the rest of his life (he died in his nineties).<br />Here was someone who truly believed in his product.	2002-02-28

Adults might feel their teeth scaling over.<br />Well, the whole book is like that.  The worst of the villains are poachers and cow thieves, although I wasn't very fond of the pastor who shouted out his parishioners' sins as they left church.  Fortunately, sins in the village of Silverydew were few and minor.<br />The plot is simple:  orphaned Victorian teen-ager, Maria Merryweather goes to live with her new guardian at lovely Moonacre Manor.  There is a curse on the manor and its surrounding acres that only she can lift.  With the help of her many animal friends (lion, hare, dog, horse, cat, unicorn) and her husband-to-be, Maria sets out to give this story a happy ending.<br />All of the animals are weighted with heavy symbolic meaning.  The lion represents the sun, courage, and loyalty.  Wiggins, the King Charles Spaniel (my favorite character) represents vanity and greed.  The unicorn is a creature of the Moon, symbolizing purity and \\"remembrance of things lost to earthly sight.\\"  And so forth.  ... including a herd of sheep that have been returned to Church ownership by Maria (hint on symbolism:  poor little sheep that have gone astray. Bah.  Bah.  Baaah.)<br />There are many lessons that girls can learn from this book.  The three that I found most obnoxious were:<br />* Curiosity is unbecoming and will lead you astray.  Adults will tell you what you need to know, when you need to know it.<br />* Never argue with your man.  Arguing could curse a whole village.<br />* The best of all possible fates is to marry your childhood sweetheart and have ten children.<br />\\"The Little White Horse\\" is written with a \\"haunting beauty of wording and atmosphere (The Saturday Review).\\"  Many people adore it (according to the cover blurb), including J.

The closest analogue that I can come up with is \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" for its eccentricity, but 'Face' outdoes 'Howl' in this respect as well as in its fear quotient. The scary scenes approach M.R. James in intensity, and they are always preceded by migraine-like aura. Prospero senses that something is slightly off about the inn where he is staying. He is still trying to figure out what is bothering him at four in the morning:<br />\\"Strange thoughts began to come to him now: locked boxes and empty rooms. Four dials and a black hole. Four cards and a blank. And a dead sound on the stroke of four. Why did that mirror bother him?<br />\\"Quietly, Prospero got dressed, took his staff from the corner, and opened the door of his room. The hall was dark and silent...He lit [a candle] and tiptoed down the stairs to the place where the mirror hung. Prospero stared and felt a chill pass through his body. The mirror showed nothing-not his face, not his candle, not the wall behind him. All he saw was a black glassy surface.\\"<br />Prospero explores further and finds his landlady standing fully-clothed in her room, with a butcher knife in her hand. \\"In her slowly rising head were two black holes. Prospero saw in his mind a doll that had terrified him when he was a child. The eyes had rattled in the china skull. Now the woman's voice, mechanical and heavy: \\"Why don't you sleep? Go to sleep.\\" Her mouth opened wide, impossibly wide, and then the whole face stretched and writhed and yawned in the faint light.\\"<br />Prospero manages to escape the inn and town that were nothing more than an elaborate trap set up by Melichus to destroy him. He is reunited with his friend, Roger Bacon and they continue on their quest to find and destroy Melichus's evil magic.<br />There are delightfully eccentric set-pieces in 'Face:' a king who builds elaborate clock-works of the universe; a monk who collects strange plants; a talking mirror that divulges scores from a 1943 Cubs-Giants baseball game. I suspect the author wove his fantasy out of migraines, nightmares, and a love of mechanical oddities and spells that turn tomatoes into squishy red carriages. Prospero himself has a \\"cherrywood bedstead with a bassoon carved into one of the fat headposts, so that it could be played as you lay in bed and meditated...On a shelf over the experiment table was the inevitable skull, which the wizard put there to remind him of death, though it usually reminded him that he needed to go to the dentist.\\"<br />I'd better put an end to this review before I quote the whole book.

His story treads very lightly on the mantle of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and a bit more heavily on Arthurian legend, but draws mainly from local folklore and Scandinavian mythology.<br />Except for school, a brief stint at Magdalen College, Oxford, and service in the Army, Mr. Garner has lived in Cheshire near Alderly Edge, as did generations of his family.  He knows the `Weirdstone' terrain as well as its folklore, and he writes about what he knows: the cliffs and meres of Alderley Edge; and the maze of mines and tunnels that underlies Cheshire.<br />`Weirdstone' doesn't follow the path of a true Arthurian romance, except for the Cave Legend, and the brief appearance of Angharad Goldenhand who might or might not be the Lady of the Lake.<br /><br />(The story of a king and his followers sleeping in a secret cave predates Arthur, but became attached to him as the `once and future king,' who will wake to serve his country again in time of great peril.)<br />There is also the wizard who guards the Cave.  In this story, his name is Cadellin, and a few centuries past he misplaced the Weirdstone of Brisingamen while bargaining for a milk-white mare.<br />This story really begins when two children, Colin and Susan get off the train at Alderley Station.  They are going to stay on the Mossock farm while their parents travel abroad, as Mrs. Mossock was their mother's former nurse.  Susan happens to be wearing a bracelet set with an unusual stone, and we gradually learn the history of the stone, which has been passed down from mother to daughter of a local Chesire family, and finally to Susan.  As family legend has it, a wizard traded the stone for a milk-white mare.<br /><br />Very soon Colin and Susan discover the truth of the family legend, when they are rescued from a band of goblins (svart-alfar) by the wizard, Cadellin, and are taken to the cave where a King sleeps, along with a hundred knights clad in silver and mounted on milk-white steeds.<br /><br />Cadellin doesn't realize why Colin and Susan were being hunted by the servants of Nastrond, the evil spirit of Ragnarok. Only after Susan's bracelet is stolen by a skeletal creature of the mist, does Cadellin understand that she possessed his magical Weirdstone.<br />Colin and Susan's quest to return the stone to Cadellin leads them on a desperate chase through the mines beneath Cheshire, and into a countryside transformed by a fierce and unseasonable fimbulwinter (the immediate prelude to the end of the world---Ragnarok.)<br /><br />This is not a good story for the claustrophobic (I almost lost it when the kids were stuck down in the mine)or for those who don't like things that go bump in the night.  There are monsters galore; almost too many to keep track of.  There are powerful wizards, both good and evil.<br />And then, there is Ragnarok.<br />However, this is a good read for those who are not easily frightened (or who love a good fright), and who have at least some knowledge of Arthurian legends and Scandinavian folklore., and are taken to the cave where a King sleeps, along with a hundred knights clad in silver and mounted on milk-white steeds.<BR> <BR>Cadellin doesn't realize why Colin and Susan were being hunted by the servants of Nastrond, the evil spirit of Ragnarok.

As in her two previous chronicles of a terraformed Moon, Meredith Ann Pierce continues the story of her heroine, Aeriel with clarity and imagination.  `Pearl' contains a bit more future science than its predecessors, but not enough to disturb those who prefer their fantasies undiluted.<br />Aerial, fourteenth bride of the redeemed darkangel, Irrylath (they literally exchanged hearts in volume I) continues her quest to save the dying Moon.  All of her world's wisdom and magic (read `advanced science') reside within the luminous heart of a pearl (read `very powerful computer').  First though, Aerial must remember who she is and what she is trying to save.  We learn through flashbacks that a minion of the evil White Witch inserted a silver pin into Aerial's head, and caused her to lose all knowledge of herself.<br />Normally, I don't care for the `amnesia' plot device, but it works well in `Pearl.'  The dedicated reader will know who Aerial is, even though the book begins:<br />\\"She had no idea where she was---only that she was in a cave, the walls pressing close about her, all of white stone.  Light came from somewhere, dim and diffuse, and the air was old:  musty and bone-dry...She gazed at the featureless walls of the cave.  She had been lost for a long time.\\"<br />Aerial stumbles across a trio of unlikely allies while lost in the caverns of the Moon.  The duaroughs (dwarves), after many adventures in the caves, help Aerial find the ancient Ravenna---one of the original humans who terraformed the Moon.  Ravenna heals Aerial from the effects of the silver pin, but at a very high cost.  Aerial regains her memory and her resolve to defeat the White Witch, but doesn't learn the price of Ravenna's healing until book's end.<br />`Pearl' enriches and deepens the entire darkangel trilogy.  It is well worth reading, even though some of its more romantic readers may shed a few tears as it ends.ntire darkangel trilogy.

He does discuss the meaning of iridium concentrations at extinction boundaries, but the main thrust of his book is a \\"comprehensive evaluation of the record of great extinctions that is being read from rocks and fossils....More generally, in the process of elucidating the crises that we term mass extinctions, this book takes the reader on a trip through the history of life on earth.\\"<br />If you are fond of journeys through what John McPhee calls `Deep Time,' this book makes an excellent and only slightly-outdated guide.  The illustrations are stunning, even in this age of three-dimensional, in-your-face velociraptors.  It is one of my favorite volumes from the Scientific American Library, along with \\"Viruses,\\" \\"The Living Cell (two volumes),\\" \\"Powers of Ten,\\" and \\"Islands.\\"  (Dear W.H. Freeman &amp; Company:  I wish you had continued this excellent series of books.)<br />There have been fewer than a dozen mass extinctions since multicellular life first appeared on Earth. Professor Stanley covers all of them, beginning with the first great extinction of the acritarchs, and ending with the demise of the mammoths, giant wombats, and Shasta ground sloths that we ourselves may have doomed.  His emphasis is on climatic change, although he doesn't consider that to have been the only factor in mass extinction---only the most important one.<br />Read Professor Stanley's well-presented evidence, and do not ask for whom the bell tolls.  It tolls for the trilobites and the lacy bryozoans of the Paleozoic, armored Dunkleosteus of the Devonian, the dinosaurs of the Mesozoic, and the great, sabre-toothed Creodonta of the Cenozoic---not to mention Smilodon fatalis of a more recent era.whom the bell tolls.

Does the huge crater buried under half a mile of sedimentary rock on the Yucat&aacute;n Peninsula have anything to do with the demise of Tyrannosaurus Rex, along with seventy percent of all species that were alive during the last days of its reign?<br />&#8220;Night Comes to the Cretaceous&#8221; answers both questions, the latter with an emphatic &#8216;yes!&#8217;  The Chicxulub (which means either &#8216;red devil&#8217; or &#8216;place of the cuckold&#8217; in Mayan) impact crater, first reported (and ignored for a decade) at the 1981 annual meeting of the Society of Exploration Geophysicists, appears to exactly the right age and the right size to have terminated most of the life on Earth, sixty-five million years ago.<br />This fascinating book by geologist James Lawrence Powell is the first I&#8217;d read on the subject of mass extinctions since &#8220;Extinction&#8221; by Steven M. Stanley, published in 1987.  What a difference two decades of discoveries made!  Stanley, although aware of the discovery of the iridium concentrations at the K-T (Cretaceous-Tertiary) boundary, concluded that global climatic change rather than extraterrestrial catastrophe caused mass extinctions.  Chicxulub was not on his event horizon, so he produced a very detailed and convincing argument for what was then the orthodox theory of extinction.<br />Unfortunately for orthodoxy, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Luis Alvarez and his son, geologist Walter Alvarez had already discovered the asteroid-impact iridium layer in 1980, and predicted the discovery of Chicxulub as the death-knell of the dinosaurs.<br />Powell in &#8220;Night Comes to the Cretaceous&#8221; details many more discoveries that supported the Alvarez theory of extinction, and changed the way scientists (and the rest of us) look at the night sky.  His book provides a comprehensive overview of all the bits and pieces of the dinosaur extinction puzzle that I had been reading about in two decades of science magazines.  It is really exciting to see the whole picture and the new orthodoxy as of 1998.<br />Furthermore, in the last few chapters of his book, Powell asks whether all mass extinctions on Earth were caused by asteroid/comet impacts.  He lists the seven known mass extinctions and presents the impact evidence for each.  Finally he discusses the theory that cratering and extinctions may be regularly spaced through time.<br />&#8216;Night&#8217; is pretty scary reading if you had planned to go out with a whimper, not a bang.the dinosaur extinction puzzle that I had been reading about in two decades of science magazines.

He teaches us how to pick a team of specialists, how to make adjuvant therapy choices, management of side effects, diet. etc.  Dr. Link is a practicing internist and oncologist, founder of the Breast Center in Long Beach, California, and also director of the Pacific Coast Breast Center in Torrance, California.<br />The author treats women with breast cancer, rather than having survived the disease himself, so the `Survival Manual' is a less personalized account than, say, \\"The Breast Cancer Companion\\" by Kathy Latour.  It is written with one degree of separation, and teaches rather than consoles.<br />For example, he writes, \\"I think it is helpful to understand the mechanism of hair loss with these drugs so you realize its true temporary quality,\\" rather than, \\"When our hair starts to fall out, it is yet another violation of our bodies and one that most women felt was much more visible and hard to conceal than the loss of a breast.\\" (quoted from \\"The Breast Cancer Companion\\" by Kathy Latour.)<br />Dr. Link's writing style is very much exemplified by his introductory quotation:  \\"Nothing in life is to be feared.  It is only to be understood---Marie Curie.\\"<br />This is a very direct, honest book that can help women with newly-diagnosed breast cancer, \\"understand their situation and develop a plan to optimize a cure.\\"  It contains questions at the end of each chapter (called `checkpoints') that women should ask themselves during each stage of diagnosis and treatment, e.g.  \\"Who is in charge of my surveillance after the end of treatment?\\" at the end of the chapter entitled, \\"Fear of Recurrence.\\"<br />There is a good list of further breast cancer resources at book's end, including an Internet site with Dr. Link's continuing updates to this manual (breastlinkcare).	2002-02-04

Any fantasy that stars a girl and her plucky horse is okay by me, unless the horse is too cutesy.  Talking horses are a bore too, but this horse (called `the horse' for most of the book) is just right, even though his new rider needs a little work.<br />Karigan is young and stubborn enough to decide that she doesn't want to be a Green Rider, no matter how many magical creatures, magical little old ladies, magical devices, and kings are pushing her into that career choice.  Luckily, the horse is there at the beginning of the book to head her in the right direction, after the dying Green Rider bequeaths his message, magical brooch, and steed to his reluctant successor.<br />As Karigan and the horse gallop deeper into the haunted forest with their message to King Zachery, they are pursued by minions of the King's evil brother, including a powerful sorcerer called `The Gray One' or `Shadow Man.'<br />\\"Green Rider\\" does suffer from a plethora of magical `deus ex machinas.'  Karigan is repeatedly rescued from her enemies by her new brooch, which makes her invisible, two Victorian-era sisters, who show up deep in the forest (along with their house) and give Karigan a magical crystal and various other gizmos, and a magical eagle who rescues her from a spider-like creature of the Dark.  There are also helpful elves, a mysterious Protector of the King's Forest, and a host of ghostly Green Riders who save her from the Gray One (at least temporarily).<br />But Britain writes an interesting fantasy that is not completely clich&eacute;d, in spite of the elves, the spider, and the Strider character.  The plot gallops right along, except for a few uphill stretches where the point-of-view switches from Karigan to the bad guys, or to her father.<br />The dullest going occurs after Karigan finally delivers the dead rider's message to King Zachary, but no one accepts its importance.  She sulks around the King's palace while various Green Riders try to persuade her to become one of them.  A couple of guys fall in love with her.  The King invites her to a ball.  There is much needless political infighting by the King's advisors (minor characters at best).<br />I was beginning to wish for the bad old days in the forest with Horse, when---bang!  The Shadow Man reappears and bolts downhill with the plot.  Karigan is kept busy for the rest of the book, rescuing King Zachary, her father, and her Green Rider friends, not to mention thwarting the Gray One's evil magic.<br />\\"Green Rider\\" comes to a satisfying and somewhat surprising conclusion, although there are enough loose ends to develop into a sequel.  I'll be watching for the further adventures of Karigan, the horse, the Green Riders, King Zachary, and (if he isn't dead yet) the Gray One.<br />And what about that wall the Gray One cracked, at the beginning of the book, in order to let evil magic back into the world?rtance.

Inspector French, who first appeared in \\"Inspector French's Greatest Case\\" in 1925, is definitely an engineer at heart.<br />This particular fictitious Chief Inspector of New Scotland Yard starred in a total of thirty mysteries from 1925 through 1957, many of them involving ships, trains (Crofts was an Irish railroad engineer), intricate time-tables, and supposedly unbreakable alibis.<br />\\"Antidote to Venom\\" (1938) is no exception.  Inspector French must dredge up every scrap of physical evidence to recreate the fiendishly clever gizmo that was used to murder an eminent professor of pathology.  He must smash the villain's alibi, and build the time-table that puts him near his victim at the time of death.  He must also figure out how a poisonous Russell's viper escaped from its supposedly sealed display case at the Birmington Zoo.<br />The difference between this Inspector French mystery and others I've read is that most of the story is told by the murderer's accomplice.  There is no mystery as to who killed the old professor.  \\"Antidote to Venom\\" is a `howdunit' rather than a whodunit.<br />The narrator is George Surridge, the middle-aged Director of the Birmington Zoo. He is a man trapped in a loveless marriage, who belatedly discovers the woman of his dreams.  His reasons for helping a murderer are gradually constructed through the first half of the novel, and the author skillfully drew me in to sympathizing with him.  I was actually sorry when Inspector French entered the case. I knew from my previous reading of Crofts' finely constructed mysteries, that George Surridge was doomed.<br />\\"Antidote to Venom\\" has a rather old-fashioned, contrived ending, but don't let that prevent you from reading this mystery author who Raymond Chandler called, `the soundest builder of them all.'	2002-01-25

Beauty is the one status symbol that cannot be taken away.  If you're beautiful, you can be set down anywhere in the world, without your I.D. or your credit cards, and people will treat you well.  Cleverness won't help you if you wind up in a place where they don't speak your language, or if your wisdom is not recognized, but beauty is the universal wealth...Anyhow, pretty people matter.  The rest of us don't.'\\"<br />The PMS outlaws themselves are two women with entirely different reasons for picking up men, humiliating them, and stealing their cars and wallets.  One of the women is an escaped convict.  The other is the attorney who sprung her out of the hoosegow.<br />There are many subplots to this novel:  Elizabeth's struggle with depression after the disappearance of her marine-biologist husband; her clueless attorney-brother's purchase of a new law office and residence (hint:  its nickname is `Tara'); a mystery involving an elderly moonshiner who once owned the stately, old mansion; and (my favorite) the lawyer, A. P.

Once I know the name of a disease or condition, this book will give me a good summary of the `how and why,' and an indication as to treatment.  Each condition, e.g. `Trauma to the Cornea', is described by subsections labeled: \\"What are the Symptoms?;\\" \\"What are the Risks?;\\" and \\"What is the Treatment?\\"<br />The manual itself is organized into chapters, each of which describes a different part of the feline anatomy and what can go wrong with it.  Parasites and infectious feline diseases get their own separate chapters.<br />The book's black and white drawings are excellent.  I had no idea a cat's kneecaps were located on its hind legs, until I looked at the drawing in Chapter 8, \\"Bones, Joints, Muscles, Ligaments and Tendons (The Musculoskeletal System).\\"  The drawings of parasitic life cycles are also very clear and interesting.<br />There are also several short appendices on subjects such as \\"Normal Physiological Data for the Feline.\\"<br />Maybe I look up words differently than everyone else who speaks English, but it leads me to mention omissions in both the Glossary and the Index.  For instance, one of my cats developed a limp and I tried to look up `tendon' and `limping' which were in neither section. I later discovered `tendon' in the index under `Musculoskeletal system'---not the first word that came to mind when I was trying to figure out what was wrong with my cat.<br />Which leads me to `limping.'  I recommend that another brief chapter (even a table) be included in this manual's next edition: a summary of symptoms and what illness or cause could be indicated by the symptom.  \\"The Cornell Book of Cats\\" has a good chapter on \\"Clinical Signs of Disease\\" that includes just such a table (okay, so it didn't have `limping' either, but it did contain `lameness'.  And its index included `tendons' and `lameness.')<br />Use \\"The Cornell Book of Cats\\" for possible diagnoses before you take your cat to the vet.  Read \\"The Complete Cat Health Manual\\" for a clear description of your cat's problem, after you come home from the clinic.<br />Note also that the Cornell book is more detailed as to treatment in the case of relatively rare diseases.

Julia is sucked up into the mind of the ragdoll who is really a powerful and evil witch.  When Julia and the ragwitch disappear through a ring of fire, Paul bravely follows them.  From then on, \\"Ragwitch\\" follows the ancient fairy-tale structure of children versus evil---a `Hansel and Gretel' story where the witch actually devours one of the children.  Garth Nix adds a ferocious edge to Paul and Julia's adventure.  I never knew what was going to happen next.<br />Both children actively oppose the ragwitch, although Julia's situation is far more horrific.  She is wired into the ragwitch's nervous system while the evil, old sorceress shambles from atrocity to atrocity.<br />(Actually, I grew fond of some of her minions, called the Stone Knights.  If you've ever seen the movie, `Monolith Monsters' you'll be able to figure how the Knights pounded into combat).<br />Once Paul is transferred to ragwitch's original world through the ring of fire, he suffers more than his share of perils, including a battle or two.  He finally finds friends and sets out on a quest to locate each of the four Elementals, Wind, Water, Fire, and Earth.  If he can talk a good line, they might help him defeat the ragwitch and her destructive minions.<br />This is my favorite part of `Ragwitch.'  The Elementals are not the usual clich&eacute;d characters found in other fantasies I could mention.  The author expends lots of imagination on them---I was never certain whether Paul was going to succeed in his quest, or die trying.<br />It isn't every boy who gets to meet Mother Earth, while digging for potatoes.<br />I can't remember how I would have handled this horror-fantasy mixture when I was under the drinking age.  The book certainly veers toward the gruesome edge of Young Adult fantasy ---think of it as `Hansel and Gretel' on steroids.	2002-01-20

The local residents defend their rural stretch of the Missouri against all intruders, and shoot a couple of guys who were actually writing a pro-rancher, anti-ecoNazi book.  This is where Harvey Weasel Fat Wallace, the Blackfeet FBI guy calls on Du Pr&eacute; to find the murderer.<br />Another FBI guy, Ripper sums up the plot:<br />\\"These people out here have had it, basically, with the twentieth century, and who can blame them?  But potting passing canoe paddlers is, and I must make this perfectly clear, like the late Tricky Dick, not going to be the protest of choice.  It's illegal.  It's also wrong.\\"<br />Everyone leans on Du Pr&eacute; in this book, including his daughter Maria. She persuades him to help a group of filmmakers (her boyfriend is the assistant director) who are shooting a documentary about the Lewis and Clark expedition.  As it happens, Maria and her father are M&eacute;tis descendants of the fiddler, Cruzatte who was a member of that famous 1805 expedition.<br />Even Du Pr&eacute;'s long-term mistress Madeleine gets into the act, and tricks her man into trying on glasses:<br />\\"`Du Pr&eacute;,' said Madelaine, `I think you maybe got eyes like a hawk, see things far away, up close you got eyes like a pocket gopher.'<br />\\"Du Pr&eacute; grunted.<br />\\"`Put a bead on that ...needle,' said Madelaine.<br />\\"Du Pr&eacute; picked up a bead, poked the needle at it, and missed.<br />\\"...'Okay, Du Pr&eacute;,' said Madelaine.  `You try these on, yes.'\\"<br />Madelaine whips out a bag of dime-store reading glasses and Du Pr&eacute; is made to realize that he hasn't seen her face or her beadwork in years.

Beagle fan-site, the author composed a song of the Innkeeper, before he wrote a book from his song---rather like Samuel Taylor Coleridge writing a fantasy novel about Xanadu, years after he had composed his poem of like name:<br />\\"...A savage place! as holy and enchanted<br />As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted<br />By woman wailing for her demon-lover!\\"<br />The \\"Innkeeper's\\" world is also savage and enchanted, and haunted by a weaver wailing for his drowned lover.  Not only does he wail; Tikat, the weaver's apprentice seeks after his lover when a wizard raises her from the bottom of the river and steals her away.<br />Although many readers may know and love Beagle's fantasy &quot;The Last Unicorn,&quot; few of them probably know that he also writes songs.

We learn of the already-woven pattern through flashbacks and dialogue.<br />The innkeeper, Karsh knows that the three women are going to cause trouble:<br />\\"The white one wore an emerald ring, /the brown led a fox on a silver string, /and the black one carried a rosewood cane /with a sword inside, for I saw it plain.\\"<br />The fox-who-is-not-a-fox immediately slaughters one of the innkeeper's chickens.  The women hunt for a dying wizard, and keep the rest of his guests awake all night with their fighting and chanting.

The only goblins are shadows in an attic or a mind.  There is alas, no fairy Godmother.  Not for anyone.<br />Is it okay to subtract a star if a book doesn't meet my expectations for `real' magic?  Not really.  All I can do is alert potential readers to the lack of dragons, mages, magical potions, and all the other usual gizmos of fantasy.  \\"Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister\\" is a panorama of every-day life in seventeenth century Holland (especially if you happen to be a painter or a grasping widow), quite colorful and beautifully written.  However, I didn't care for the author's habit of leaning over my shoulder and pointing out the lessons I should be learning from his book.  There is even a \\"Reader's Group Guide\\" at novel's end with questions such as, \\"...Each character in `Confessions' has blinkers or blinders on about one thing or another.  What do the characters overlook, in themselves and in one another?\\"<br />Some reviews found this habit to be \\"ironic and sophisticated,\\" but I found it to be pretentious.  Ultimately it was the reason why I subtracted a star, even though `Confessions' is a fascinating character study---no one behaved as might be expected from Charles Perrault's fairy tale.<br />The action takes place while Marie de' Medici is Queen Mother in France, sometime during the first half of the seventeenth century.  In the story, she is pictured as an old woman who `travels' to Holland to pick an artist worthy of painting her last portrait (she was indeed, a very well-painted queen, most notably by Peter Paul Rubens).  A ball is given in her honor by the richest family in Haarlem, and it wouldn't be giving away much of the plot to say that the Cinderella character meets her prince at this ball.  However, this is a fairy tale turned inside-out (as you may have guessed from the book's title).  The characters I found most appealing were the scheming stepmother (at least until the last few pages of the book), one of the ugly stepsisters, and the painter who wanted Queen Marie to pick him as her ultimate portraitist.<br />Note:  Marie de' Medici was actually forced into exile by her son, Louis XIII of France.  She died in the Netherlands in 1642.st appealing were the scheming stepmother (at least until the last few pages of the book), one of the ugly stepsisters, and the painter who wanted Queen Marie to pick him as her ultimate portraitist. <br />Note:  Marie de' Medici was actually forced into exile by her son, Louis XIII of France.

Most of her books are compulsive page-turners (I've been reading her ever since \\"The Master of Blacktower\\"), but the plot of this one gets literally lost in the maze (the `dancing floor' of the title).  The heroine gets lost in the maze too, but fights her way out and makes a dramatic entrance into the lives of her future employer and his disdainful son.<br />The son, Jordan doesn't believe the maze exists.  He is also suspicious of the heroine, Heather's semi-accidental precipitation into the middle of his breakfast.  However his father is intrigued by a woman, self-described as pudgy and plain, who has the same unusual surname as the seventeenth-century landscape artist who had designed his newly-acquired manor's gardens.  The rich old man persuades Heather (who happens to be an avid student of seventeenth-century garden designers, or `florists' as they were then called) to stay on and help him renovate his gardens.<br />Heather is a very pugnacious heroine who fights with almost every other major character in the book, including a very nasty little boy and his equally nasty mother.  She even gets physical with the boy after he causes her to wreck her car, and again when she catches him torturing his sister.  She also falls for the nasty boy's father, an Ashley Wilkes clone who suffers nobly, and conveniently leaves the scene when Heather figures out whom she really loves.  This book isn't quite as long as \\"Gone with the Wind,\\" but it still takes Heather four hundred and fifty pages to ditch the Ashley character and announce her true feelings.<br />The maze wanders in and out of the plot.  Heather discovers that a local coven is using it as a meeting place.  A body is found within.  The reader learns a bit about the history of mazes and labyrinths.  Most of the supernatural activity, unlike previous novels by Barbara Michaels, occurs in Heather's dreams---a bit of a cheat, if you ask me.  The maze was getting such a big build-up, I figured there was going to be a shuddery, occult denouement within its shrubbery.  Not a crazed murderer who seemed to lack motivation for his or her heinous deeds, and who was hoist on such a convenient petard.<br />If you are a new Barbara Michaels reader, try one of her earlier novels (I was particularly fond of \\"Sons of the Wolf\\"), or else wait for her next dance.e maze was getting such a big build-up, I figured there was going to be a shuddery, occult denouement within its shrubbery.

According to the author, they may actually be Italian chickens, originating near the River Po.  They are the avian equivalent of Old English Sheepdogs.  Ice can form in their topknots in cold weather, and their crest feathers restrict vision, which causes them to be easily frightened.  However, they see very well downward, which after all is the food direction for chickens.<br />I'm not precisely a poultry romantic, having once helped a friend clean out a chicken coop.  But Stephen Green-Armytage's book, and yearly visits to the Poultry exhibit at the Michigan State Fair have convinced me that I am going to raise chickens some day.  Just the thought of a flock of Owlbeards, Polish Frizzles, or Buff Orpingtons bobbing through my garden and gobbling up the cutworms and grasshoppers is enough to make me smile.  I can always hire someone else to clean out the coop.<br />\\"Extraordinary Chickens\\" is not a how-to poultry manual.  It is a book of beautiful photographs that grew out of an assignment the author undertook for \\"LIFE Magazine.\\"  There is also some explanatory text on a small but striking selection of the more than five hundred poultry breeds that have been recorded by poultry photographers such as Josef Wolters and Rudiger Wandelt.  It certainly stands testament to the breeders'desire to develop chickens with an amazing variety of shapes, sizes, and colors.  There are photographs of chickens with combs like red sea coral (Hamburgs) and Moose antlers (Sicilian Buttercups); chickens with tails that are twenty feet long (the Phoenix or Onagadori); and chickens that look like pheasants (Sumatras) or Bulldogs (Cornish game birds---at least from the front).<br />The author suggests attending a poultry show, if you find yourself intrigued by the photographs in this book---\\"In 1995, a show in Nuremberg, Germany, boasted a total of more than seventy thousand birds, a record that will probably be beaten before this book appears.\\"  California seems to be the hotbed of ornamental poultry in this country, although I can testify to the fact that Michigan has at least one yearly show.<br />If you think you might actually want to raise your own poultry, first read Chapter Nine of the totally fascinating \\"Encyclopedia of Country Living\\" by Carla Emery.  It's got everything from \\"Good Recipes for Old Hens\\" to a section on roosters divided into \\"Crowing,\\" \\"Fighting,\\" and \\"Making Capons.\\"cord that will probably be beaten before this book appears.\\"  California seems to be the hotbed of ornamental poultry in this country, although I can testify to the fact that Michigan has at least one yearly show.<br />If you think you might actually want to raise your own poultry, first read Chapter Nine of the totally fascinating \\"Encyclopedia of Country Living\\" by Carla Emery.

Salvage Tug	Books	5	29	29	N	N	The unsinkable Foundation Franklin	The ocean-going salvage tug, Foundation Franklin was more than a match for the worst the North Atlantic could throw at her, including Force 10 gales and Nazi U-Boats.  Perfect Storm, eat your heart out!  Here is the real book about the great-hearted men and their staunch little ships that survived blow after blow from the Atlantic and bobbed up for more.<br />If the author, Farley Mowat is sometimes guilty of over-the-top prose---well, he lived and worked on the Franklin, and he loved her sturdy lines, her jaunty roll, and every rivet that held her together while she rescued ships that were Goliaths to her chubby, little Baby Huey.  No work could have been more dangerous; none required a higher degree of seamanship and courage than dropping a line on a berserk, lunging, steel-hulled freighter, and then towing her through the maw of a mid-December gale, or the shoals and sunkers of the Newfoundland coast---something the Franklin did so many times that her crew lost memory of all but their most freakish or man-killing expeditions.<br />Grey Seas Under will give you an interesting perspective on the true maritime heroes of World War II.  Farley Mowat doesnt pull any punches when he describes the tension that existed between the expert seamen on the ocean-going salvage and rescue tugs, and their relatively amateur counterparts on Canadian and American naval warships.  Some of the funniest scenes in the book involve convoys of merchant ships under the protection of corvettes and destroyers.  Once a U-Boat had been sighted and the merchants steamed for cover, it was up to the Franklin to rescue the ones that ran into each other or shoaled themselves.  Usually, the tug had to perform her duties without any cover from the warships.<br />The days the salvors (tugboat seamen) spent tethered to fat and crippled merchantmen, crawling along on a straight course at a speed of two or three knots like mechanical targets in a shooting gallery, were the kind of days that would drain the courage from the most heroic man aliveThe Germans knew, that for every rescue vessel sunk there would be a score of crippled merchantmen who would never make safe port.<br />This is a great book about men against the sea, even though the language gets very nautical at times.  Read it and you will learn all about Lloyds Open Form, and the tricks that wrecked merchant masters play to cheat tugs out of their salvage fees.  Youll learn to tell the difference between Monkey Island and the poop deck---and the difference between brass monkeys and true seamen.  Youll thrill to the dangers of sunkers, beam seas, and Arctic white-outs.  Youll bite through your pipe-stem, just like the Franklins captain did during those tows when his sturdy little tug steamed back into port with barely enough coal in her bunkers to cook a pot of beans.<br />Someone ought to make a movie out of Grey Seas Under.

The mystery centers around the disappearance of so many ex-wartime Liberty freighters in mid-ocean.  Most of them were in ballast when they vanished, and it was assumed but never proven that shifting ballast caused the freighters to turn turtle and sink so rapidly that no message could be transmitted on the `how' or `why' of their plight.<br />`Leicester' was an ex-Liberty freighter fitted out in peace-time rig, newly under the command of Captain Hamish Lawson.  He met his ship for the first time while she was taking ballast---\\"a sludge of sand and gravel dredged from the bottom of the [Thames]\\"---in preparation for a voyage to New York.  Lawson had originally been scheduled to take command of another ex-Liberty freighter (called Sam-ships by the sailors, because they were built for the wartime Lend Lease program by `Uncle Sam'), but the `Samkey' had disappeared on route to Cuba.  \\"'Leicester' was the twin sister to `Samkey'; built in the same yards, to the identical design.  The only difference was that she was younger by a year...\\"<br />Captain Lawson's freighter was halfway between Ireland and Nova Scotia on the Great Circle route to New York when the first storm struck.  `Leicester' rolled more than her Master liked, but she weathered the gale easily enough.  His main worry was the ship's malfunctioning radio, without which he couldn't receive weather reports or transmit his own position.  The Atlantic was not a good place to be in the middle of the hurricane season, without a radio.<br />Sure enough on the morning of September 14th, the crew of the `Leicester' found themselves sailing under another threatening sky:<br />\\"Lawson watched the ominous black arch [of the hurricane bar] for a quarter of an hour, and even during this short interval it seemed to grow, humping up from the horizon, spreading east and west.  Above it, and around the hemisphere of sky, the high clouds were thickening, growing more opaque.  A light, aimless breeze that seemed to come erratically from every point of the compass had begun to play about the ship.  Lawson noticed that there were no gulls or other seabirds anywhere in sight.\\"<br />The Sam-ship tried to dodge the hurricane, but it was much too late for such maneuvers.

The rest of his book describes the travails of `Leicester' as she founders but does not sink amidst the coils of the first hurricane.  Her adventures afterward are entwined with those of the salvage and rescue tugs, `Foundation Lillian' and `Foundation Josephine,' plus another, even more savage hurricane that struck while the Sam-ship lay helplessly at what was supposed to be a safe mooring.<br />\\"The Serpent's Coil\\" and its even more exciting companion, \\"Grey Seas Under\\" are gripping testaments to the daring and skill of Canada's master seamen.

He rode with short stirrups, which brought his knees nearly up to the pommel of the saddle; his sharp elbows stuck out like a grasshopper's; he carried his whip perpendicularly in his hand, like a scepter, and, as his horse jogged on, the motion of his arms was not unlike the flapping of a pair of wings.&quot;<br />All of the eight remaining stories were selected for their high fright quotient, including the dreadful &quot;Monkey's Paw.&quot; All are accompanied by full-page illustrations in both color and black-and-white---as I mentioned earlier, &quot;Ghosts&quot; is a labor of love. There are thirty illustrations for the nine stories, and in his acknowledgement Sturrock thanks thirty-two of his friends and relatives by name for &quot;posing for the characters in this edition...&quot;<br /><br />Connoisseurs of phantasmagoric tales might even be able to recognize these old, oft-collected stories by the names of their illustrations, e.g. &quot;The Judge's Rat,&quot; &quot;The Horror of the Second Wish,&quot; and &quot;Robbing the Grave&quot; for &quot;The Judge's House&quot; by Bram Stoker, &quot;The Monkey's Paw&quot; by W.W. Jacobs, and &quot;The Body-Snatchers&quot; by Robert Louis Stevenson, respectively.<br />If you ever want to pose for the picture of a headless woman, skeletal child, or ghastly corpse, please contact the illustrator of this book.<br />Note: the title on the cover of &quot;Ghosts: A Classic Collection&quot; is the somewhat misleading &quot;Ghost Stories,&quot; but you'll be able to recognize Sturrock's work from his picture of Wiley's swamp, the rearing black horse, and the horseman with his head stuck on his pommel.or the picture of a headless woman, skeletal child, or ghastly corpse, please contact the illustrator of this book.<br />Note: the title on the cover of &quot;Ghosts: A Classic Collection&quot; is the somewhat misleading &quot;Ghost Stories,&quot; but you'll be able to recognize Sturrock's work from his picture of Wiley's swamp, the rearing black horse, and the horseman with his head stuck on his pommel.	2001-11-27

However, &quot;The Edge of the Unknown&quot; does not present rational arguments for and against the existence of life after death, as this reader might have expected from the creator of the world's greatest fictional detective:<br />&quot;I believe that all of these varied [psychic or paranormal] experiences have been sent to us not to amuse us by tales to be told and then forgotten but as the essential warp and woof of a new spiritual garment which is to be woven for the modern world. We live in an age which has long demanded a sign, yet when the sign was sent it was blind to it.&quot;<br />The author does not fashion a logical case so much as he harangues and pleads, and indulges in embarrassing name-calling. One of his primary targets is Harry Houdini, the great magician, escape artist, and debunker of psychic charlatans. Conan Doyle claims to be Houdini's friend, then waits until the magician is safely dead and argues that Houdini used paranormal powers to perform his escape routines---otherwise they would have been impossible!<br />According to this book's dust cover, &quot;...Conan Doyle was a tough, not-to-be-bamboozled skeptic. The reader will find, then, his testimony especially persuasive---encompassing mediums whose bodies produce ectoplasm; weird prophetic dreams; s&eacute;ances with 'ghosts' of Lenin, Oscar Wilde, Dickens and other famous people.&quot;<br />This reader was persuaded of just the opposite. She was especially disturbed by the author's claim that the Great Houdini was a fraud because he 'used' paranormal powers in his escape routines, then turned around and debunked other 'legitimate' psychics.	2001-11-25

It had not gone out-of-date.  If it had aged at all, it was in Michener's less-than-balanced account of the Spanish Civil War (of course the same could be said of Hemingway).<br />\\"Iberia\\" is a massive, thousand-page love affair with Spain, part history, part travelogue, and part parador-and-tapa-bar guide.  It is not `merely' a tour guide to Spain, any more than Rebecca West's \\"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon\\" is `merely' a tour guide to Yugoslavia.  With the possible exception of his Pulitzer Prize winning \\"Tales of the South Pacific\\", I believe this to be Michener's finest work.<br />My opinion (or prejudice) is based on our unforgettable journey through Spain.  Michener took us places we never would have found in the standard tourist guides.  We pigged out in his tapa bars-\\"first comes the seafood--- the anchovies, eel, squid, octopus, herring, shrimp, salmon, five kinds of sardines, five kinds of fish; next come the boiled eggs, deviled eggs, egg salad, potato omelets cut in strips, vegetables, onions, salads; third are the cold meats in great variety, including meat balls, York ham, Serran ham, tripe, brains, liver in a variety of styles, beef, pork and veal; and finally the hot dishes...\\"<br />I booked us into many of the paradors that he recommended.  Paradors are combination  hotel-museums, which serve some of the best food in Spain---\\"Where practical, the paradors are housed in ancient buildings, such as old convents, monasteries, castles no longer in use, hospitals dating back to the age of the Catholic Kings, or inns in which Columbus may have slept.\\"<br />In Merida, we stayed in a parador that is housed in the 500-year-old Convento de los Frailes de Jesus (Michener's personal favorite).  Then there was the castle-parador, the parador that is built within the Alhambra, and the modern, ski-resort parador on the slopes of Monte Perdido.  We stumbled across the last-mentioned resort while lost in the Pyrenees, and had it literally to ourselves (and one other couple), since the season was late spring.<br />My one regret is that we did not get to attend the ancient horse fair that follows Holy Week in Seville, and is so lovingly described in \\"Iberia.\\"  This fair dates back \\"two thousand years to the days when Romans came here to buy horses for their generals...If a man likes horses, this rough-and-ready market with no rules and little order would delight him.  It is conducted under a blazing sun and has about it a strange and ancient quality.

Death has black silk sheets---to a gentle tale from Charles de Lint about a woman who wants to experience her dog's dreams.<br />Although S&amp;S tales predominate, the stories I liked best were the oddballs that involved spells, but not from the standard grimoire.  My favorite, \\"A Spatter of Later Stars\\" by Nina Kiriki Hoffman, concerns a girl who paints faces at a carnival.  She comes into her gift at age fourteen: the gift of making people feel beautiful---or otherwise.  No death-dealing wizards.  No women in breast-plates.  Just a slightly-out-of-the-ordinary carnival family and a wonderful fourteenth birthday present.<br />\\"A Spatter of Later Stars\\" would have deserved inclusion in the wonderful \\"Magic in Ithkar\\" fantasy volumes which were edited by Andre Norton and Robert Adams, if (alas) the series hadn't petered out after Volume Four.<br />\\"And King Hereafter\\" is a Boscobel League story by Rosemary Edghill, involving a slight, sorcerous meddling with the Royal Succession in England---what if that awful American divorcee had died before she could marry the future king?<br />Another offbeat fantasy in this collection, \\"The Midas Spell\\" by Julie E. Czerneda could be said to involve wizardly meddling with American history.  It's the story of an all-star running back who really, really wants his team to win the Super Bowl.<br />All in all, thirteen tales of (mostly) original magic, a leetle heavy on S&amp;S for my taste.	2001-11-19

However, she does occasionally reveal a playful side to her husband.<br />At the beginning of \\"The Crabtree Affair,\\" the reader finds Sir John and his wife strolling along a disused canal, one fine English summer day.  They indulge in affectionately ironic conversation, making it obvious that theirs is a long-standing marriage (although as I remember, they also talked that way to each other before marriage---see \\"Appleby's End\\"):<br />Lady Judith:  \\"It's private enough.  As we were saying, this country-side seems absolutely deserted.  Not a sign of habitation, population, a trace of the modern world.\\"<br />Sir John:  \\"You're wrong there, Judith.  Look south.\\"<br />\\"Judith looked south---which was towards what Appleby had called the secondary motor road.  All she saw was a momentary glint of light.<br />\\"'I think,' she said, `that I saw the sun reflected from the wind screen of a passing car.  Right?'<br />\\"'Right as far as you go.  What you saw was a silver-grey Rolls-Royce Phantom V.'<br />\\"'My dear John, it's terribly vulgar to name cars---particularly astoundingly expensive ones.  It's only done by cheap novelists.  You must just say: `a very large car.''<br />\\"Appleby received this with hilarity.\\"<br />Eventually (you knew this was going to happen), the Applebys find a body floating face-down in the scummy canal-water.  The quest for the murderer of returned prodigal, Seth Crabtree, proceeds in the leisurely fashion of a Golden Age British manor house mystery.  It is leavened, as are all of Michael Innes's novels, with a great deal of erudite wit and conversation.  It has not one, but two snobbish butlers, and also features Judith's eccentric great-uncle, Colonel Raven whose life's work-in-progress is the \\"Atlas and Entomology of the Dry-Fly Streams of England.\\"<br />If you are a already a fan of Margery Allingham, Edmund Crispin, or Dorothy Sayers, you definitely need to add Michael Innes's mysteries to your reading list.  \\"The Crabtree Affair\\" is perfect in its class, and you will also learn quite a bit about the English Canal system.Judith's eccentric great-uncle, Colonel Raven whose life's work-in-progress is the \\"Atlas and Entomology of the Dry-Fly Streams of England.\\"<br />If you are a already a fan of Margery Allingham, Edmund Crispin, or Dorothy Sayers, you definitely need to add Michael Innes's mysteries to your reading list.  \\"The Crabtree Affair\\" is perfect in its class, and you will also learn quite a bit about the English Canal system.	2001-11-17

It doesn't matter whether you're a ranch hand, a fiddler, a rich alcoholic, or just passing through.  In fact the LL Bean-clad, Volvo-driving Yuppie tourists are the ones who usually take it on the chin, although Bowen only inflicts them with a verbal barrage in \\"The Stick Game.\\"  He is concentrating on more serious targets: alcoholism; and the mysterious illnesses, mutations, and deaths of children and animals on the Fort Belknap Reservation.<br />Bowen's detective-hero, Gabriel Du Pr&eacute; is a laconic fiddler who lets his music and his deeds speak for him.  He and his long-time mistress, Madelaine are M&eacute;tis descendants of the French Voyageurs and Plains Indians.<br />Du Pr&eacute;'s rich friend Bart is also unusually laconic in this seventh mystery in the series.  Most of his lines consist of one-word expletives.  However, Bart's language can be excused since he is very stressed out by his friends' rude jokes about his new lady friend, not to mention the realization that he owns millions of dollars of stock in a local gold mining company that is injecting poisons into the water table.<br />In what might be the most cheerful scene in \\"The Stick Game,\\" Du Pr&eacute; blows out the transmission on his old police cruiser, loses his brakes and goes shooting through a series of downhill, hairpin turns at eighty miles an hour.  He and Madelaine narrowly miss an oncoming eighteen-wheeler, go twanging through a barbwire fence, and finally slow to a stop in a rancher's stock pond:<br />\\"The water was only two feet deep.<br />\\"Du Pr&eacute; mopped at his face with a greasy towel that lived on the floor of the cruiser.  He could see.<br />\\"'Hey, Du Pr&eacute;,' Madelaine laughed, `That was some fun yes!  I am paying two dollars that ride at a carnival!  Hah!  We have good luck!'<br />\\"'S__t,' said Du Pr&eacute;.\\"<br />These are some tough people in Bowen's book.  I think you'll end up feeling good about the life-affirming way that his characters deal with their problems.  Rich Uncle Bart helps smooth the way for some, but this is a barbwire book---you'll find it poking you in some unexpected places.od about the life-affirming way that his characters deal with their problems.

Following his fourth-place finish in that Derby, the huge bay gelding whose nickname was `Big Joe' would finish out of the money only four more times in forty-nine starts.  He would go on to earn `Horse of the Year' titles in 1974, 1975, and 1976.<br />But `Big Joe' never did race against `Big Red' again, partly because of his trainer's promise, but also because Forego didn't really come into his best form until he was a four-year-old---the year that Secretariat retired to stud.<br />\\"Forego\\" is the sixth volume in the excellent `Thoroughbred Legends' series published by the Eclipse Press.  This book celebrates one of modern racing's greatest weight-carriers---a hard-trying, seventeen-hand gelding who towered over his lightly weighted opposition, in spite of chronic ankle problems.  `Big Joe' raced over six seasons and earned scores of loyal fans who almost always made him the favorite, no matter how much lead he had to carry under his saddle.  His special nemesis, the New York racing secretary Tommy Trotter once assigned him to carry twenty-seven pounds more than his lightly regarded opposition.<br />Trotter's handicapping skills helped to bring about one of racing's greatest moments: \\"...Forego's desperate rally on the far outside to catch Honest Pleasure at the wire in the 1976 Marlboro Cup while carrying 137 pounds, eighteen more than the horse he had to run down, on a sloppy surface that Forego usually could not handle.\\"<br />Like two other great Thoroughbred geldings of the latter part of the Twentieth century, Kelso and John Henry, Forego ran until he just plumb wore out, always giving his fans his formidable best.  No matter that his trainer had to spend three hours a day hosing down Big Joe's sore legs.  No matter that he had lost his previous race, or had to carry twelve to twenty-seven more pounds than his four-legged opponents, Forego's fans made the towering bay their betting favorite.<br />Hall of Fame jockey Bill Shoemaker who won the Belmont five times, the Kentucky Derby four times, and the Preakness twice on Thoroughbreds other than Forego, paid special tribute to the great heavyweight champion:  \\"This has to be the best horse I've ever ridden.\\"an his four-legged opponents, Forego's fans made the towering bay their betting favorite.<br />Hall of Fame jockey Bill Shoemaker who won the Belmont five times, the Kentucky Derby four times, and the Preakness twice on Thoroughbreds other than Forego, paid special tribute to the great heavyweight champion:  \\"This has to be the best horse I've ever ridden.\\"	2001-11-12

The reader has already been introduced to the owner of the castle, Lord Ampersand, his eccentric and quarrelsome family, and his equally eccentric staff.  Sir John receives his first introduction to the family and their quarrels as a body hurtles down from the North Tower and lands at his feet.<br />It is the body of Dr. Sutch, an archivist who has been hired to search for the missing Ampersand family papers, valuable documents that could contain letters from the Romantic poets, Shelley and Byron, and possibly a lost play by Coleridge.  Dr. Sutch has also been searching (on the sly) for the legendary Ampersand treasure that was supposedly looted from a wrecked Spanish galleon during the reign of Elizabeth I.<br />\\"The Ampersand Papers\\" twists and turns through many ornate plot lines involving not one, but two missing treasures, a shady archivist, an equally shady speleologist named Cave, and an inbred, upper-class family with a fondness for practical jokes and multi-generational feuds.<br /><br />The author, John Innes Mackintosh Stewart (pseudonym Michael Innes) was born in 1906 in Edinburgh, Scotland.  He was educated at Oriel College, Oxford, and his mysteries reflect both his scholarship, and the year he spent in Vienna, studying Freudian psychoanalysis.<br />There are few dialogues in the Appleby novels that are more subtle and psychologically revealing than the one between Sir John and Lady Ampersand on the subject of her son and her son's heir.  Innes always displays a talent for playful, erudite dialogue, but in this particular scene his readers must delve below the superficial chat about Lady Ampersand's jigsaw puzzle in order discover which of two suspects is really capable of murder.<br />Even though the mystery seems overly complicated, the psychological portraits are vintage Innes, and each of the conspirators is very satisfyingly hoisted on his or her own petard by novel's end.w the superficial chat about Lady Ampersand's jigsaw puzzle in order discover which of two suspects is really capable of murder.  <br />Even though the mystery seems overly complicated, the psychological portraits are vintage Innes, and each of the conspirators is very satisfyingly hoisted on his or her own petard by novel's end.	2001-11-02

Dr. Ryan describes emerging plagues such as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, AIDS, and Junin fever in grim, gory, pathological detail. If that were not enough to keep his readers sleepless, the author spends the last few chapters theorizing on why new and perhaps deadlier plagues may soon emerge. In the final chapter, &quot;Virus X - The Doomsday Scenario,&quot; he discusses the (thus far, theoretical) makeup of a virus that could cause the extinction of the human race.<br />Viruses already exist that are uniformly fatal to people, if not treated. Rabies is one of them, but luckily for us it has a rather clunky delivery system:<br />&quot;The human rabies virus lives in a symbiotic cycle with bats, from which it is capable of infecting a wide variety of mammals, particularly foxes, coyotes, jackals, and rodents...The virus is programmed to infect the brain centers in the animal that induce uncontrollable rage, while also replicating in the salivary glands to best spread the contagion through the provoked frenzy of biting.&quot;<br />(The bad news is that out of the 5,000+ species of mammals on our planet, a thousand species are bats, and over two thousand species are rodents.)<br />Another almost uniformly fatal virus with a relatively inefficient delivery system is HIV-1.<br />Dr. Ryan asks the question, &quot;Could such lethal agents [HIV-1, Ebola, rabies] ever take the second step, and become sufficiently contagious to infect all or virtually all of the human species?...the only route of contagion likely to prove universally threatening to humanity would be person-to-person spread by the respiratory route.&quot;<br />According to Dr. Ryan, Virus X - the (so far theoretical) uniformly lethal virus would have to invade our bodies through the lungs, survive immune system attacks while making its way through the blood stream, occupy its target organs, amplify itself, and then repeat the journey in reverse to infect someone else through a cough or a sneeze.<br />In one of the scariest passages in his book, the author describes a virus, the 'Sin nombre' hantavirus that almost accomplished all of the above steps:<br />&quot;The importance of each step in this concatenation of genesis is illustrated by the 'Sin nombre' epidemic. It was the failure of the hantavirus [on its return journey to the lungs] to cross successfully from the lining of the capillaries to the adjacent air sacs---a distance of mere microns---that prevented a lethal pandemic from originating in the United States in 1993.&quot;<br />&quot;Virus X&quot; is a gripping, well-written book by an authority on infectious diseases, and you don't necessarily have to agree with the author's theory of 'the aggressive symbiont' to be enthralled, educated, and frightened. Those men and women in the moon-suits that we see every day now on T.V. are not going to go away, Lord bless them. Let's hope they can find a way to multiply as fast as the newly emerging viruses that Dr. Ryan sees infesting our future.<br />This author has written another five star book called, &quot;The Forgotten Plague - How the Battle against Tuberculosis Was Won---and Lost&quot; which I highly recommend.<br />If you are interested in further reading on emerging viruses, try &quot;The Coming Plague - Newly Emerging Diseases in a World out of Balance&quot; by Laurie Garrett.<br />We've been warned.t organs, amplify itself, and then repeat the journey in reverse to infect someone else through a cough or a sneeze.<br />In one of the scariest passages in his book, the author describes a virus, the 'Sin nombre' hantavirus that almost accomplished all of the above steps:<br />&quot;The importance of each step in this concatenation of genesis is illustrated by the 'Sin nombre' epidemic.

Gervase Fen, Oxford don of English Language and Literature, and amateur detective extraordinaire is hired by the film company as a story consultant, and he is plagued throughout the book by a Scotland Yard detective who is an amateur classics scholar.  Fen wants to discuss the murder.  Chief Inspector Humbleby wants to talk about the Brontes and Dr. Johnson.  Neither one will admit to a less than perfect understanding of either his profession or his hobby, and both despise amateurs.  Their encounters keep \\"Sudden Vengeance\\" sparkling along right up until its final page.  Here is a sample of dialogue, wherein Inspector Humbleby deliberately misunderstands Fen's explanation of the film's subject:<br />\\"Based,\\" Fen reiterated irritably, \\"on the life of Pope.\\"<br />\\"The Pope?\\"<br />\\"Pope.\\"<br />\\"Now which Pope would that be, I wonder?\\" said Humbleby, with the air of one who tries to take an intelligent interest in what is going forward.  \\"Pius, or Clement, or--&quot;<br />Fen stared at him.  \\"Alexander, of course.\\"<br />\\"You mean\\"---Humbleby spoke with something of an effort---\\"you mean the Borgia?\\"<br />All of Crispin's characters are carefully (one might say `crisply') developed, and distinguished for the reader by a quirk or eccentric manner of speech (sometimes Crispin overplays the eccentricity at the expense of realism, especially with his main protagonist-- I do wish Fen would stop expostulating, \\"Oh, my fur and whiskers!\\").  Physical description is sketchy.  If one of Crispin's characters walked past you in the street, you probably wouldn't recognize him.  However, if you were to overhear his conversation with the postman---<br />And I don't mean to imply that \\"Sudden Vengeance\\" is all dialogue and no action.  There is one especially harrowing scene where a young woman chases the murderer into a maze in order to learn his identity and then (when reason returns) can't find her way back out again.  By the time Fen rescues her, she has endured an experience right out of an M.R. James horror story (in fact, the young woman quotes M.R. James at length while she is traversing the maze - a typical Crispin characteristic).<br />The mystery surrounding the murderer's identity and motivation is as cleverly convoluted as the maze, and it is equally as hard to get to its heart.  Crispin himself wrote and published at least one film script and composed music for several films, so \\"Sudden Vengeance\\" is told with the knowledge of a movie industry insider.<br />If you like vintage British mysteries with a `classical education' and haven't yet discovered the `Professor Fen' novels, then you're in for a treat-- assuming you can find these out-of-print volumes.  Here are all nine of the Fen mysteries plus two collections of short stories, in case you want to keep going:<br />\\"The Case of the Gilded Fly\\" (\\"Obsequies at Oxford\\"), 1944;<br />&quot;Holy Disorders,\\" 1945;<br />\\"The Moving Toyshop,\\" 1946;<br />\\"Swan Song\\" (\\"Dead and Dumb\\"), 1947;<br />\\"Love Lies Bleeding,\\" 1948;<br />\\"Buried for Pleasure,\\" 1948;<br />\\"Frequent Hearses\\" (\\"Sudden Vengeance\\"), 1950;<br />\\"The Long Divorce,\\" 1952;<br />\\"Beware of the Trains,\\" 1953 (short stories);<br />\\"The Glimpses of the Moon,\\" 1978;<br />\\"Fen Country,\\" 1979 (short stories).ng, \\"Oh, my fur and whiskers!\\").

Blake, a 1950s citizen of our own Earth is accidentally caught up in the chase for a telepathic psychopath who is looking for an alternate Earth to rule.<br />This is a solid adventure about a brave band of Time Wardens, who have sworn to protect alternate Earths from manipulation by sociopaths.  Blake is an appealing young man who is enlisted in the bizarre cross-world pursuit, almost against his will.  He is tumbled from Earth to Earth, burnt, frozen, terrified at times and struggling to survive against ogres, robotic worms, and the renegade telepath.  He finally lands in the ruins of New York City on an Earth where Hitler won the Battle of Britain.  In an eerie echo of our own time, Blake joins the fight against evil with gritty New Yorkers who have survived both bombing and plague.<br />Andre Norton's rendition of tough guy dialogue may ring quaintly in modern ears, but that shouldn't keep her fans from seeking out this book and its successor, \\"Quest Crosstime.\\"	2001-10-19

Breathe in, breathe out, and follow Blake Walker as he attempts to track down a missing telepathic twin, with the help of her similarly-gifted sister.<br />\\"Quest Crosstime\\" is a wildly scenic adventure through alternate Earths.  One of my favorites---a jewel-like vignette to the main plot---is ruled by turtles whose brainy heads are too large to pull back into their shells.<br />E6525, the alternate Earth where much of the action takes place, had a couple of twists to its history as compared to our own time line:<br />* Richard III won the Battle of Boswell and the Plantagenets continued to rule in England;<br />* Cortez was killed in his final battle with the Aztecs, and the Spanish never established an Empire in the New World.<br />Norton expends a great deal of imagination and verve in creating a successor Aztec Empire that rules North America west of the Mississippi.  The action never falters as Blake in his disguise as a trader from New Britain continues his search for the missing twin.<br />I believe the author may have originally planned to write a sequel to \\"Quest Crosstime,\\" as the action ends rather abruptly with some of the Time Wardens still stranded on E6525, and only a handful of the bad guys accounted for.  I've checked Andre Norton's web site and no sequel is listed, so if any of her fans know of one, please drop me a line.	2001-10-17

American Kelsie McBlair falls through an ancient stone gate in the Scottish Highlands while rescuing a wounded wild cat.  She and the cat (who promptly gives birth to two kittens) are besieged on the other side of the Gate by a Dark Rider and a pack of skeletal hounds, almost before Kelsie realizes she is no longer in Scotland.  (It will take the rest of the book to persuade her that there is no way back to her home world).<br />When a dying Witch bequeaths her true name and her jewel of power to Kelsie, the American finds herself compelled to take up the woman's sorcerous mission into the heart of Escore, where magic lies in \\"trembling balance between the forces of Light and those of the Dark.\\"<br />\\"The Gate of the Cat\\" is a stand-alone fantasy in Norton's fabulous Witch World series.  It takes place (roughly) after the conclusion of \\"Sorceress of the Witch World\\" and \\"Trey of Swords,\\" since characters from both of those novels also play roles (or are at least mentioned) in this book.  Yonan, a former border guard of Estcarp and the main narrator of \\"Trey of Swords,\\" is one of Kelsie's companions on her reluctant quest.  Their other companion is a rather nasty, man-hating witch who is known as Wittle. (Sometimes Norton attaches clunky names to her characters, but Wittle really is Wittle).<br />The magic and the narrative pace are vintage Norton, and she takes us into one of the vilest places of the Dark to be found in any of the Escore fantasies.<br />\\"The Gate of the Cat\\" is a must-read for Witch World fans.	2001-10-16

The cover blurb has it that this book is in the tradition of Stephen Jay Gould and Oliver Sacks, which I took to mean a collection of thematically connected essays on science. Gould concentrates on learned, very readable essays on evolution; Sacks specializes in tales of neurological dysfunction, e.g. the famous \\"Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat.\\"<br />However, Ingram doesn't attempt to thread his miscellany of essays with an overarching theme, as do Gould and Sacks.  He is more in the tradition of magpie science---he writes about whatever catches his eye.<br />Here are a couple of his essays that caught my eye:<br />\\"Consumed by Learning\\"---I was saddened to learn that the \\"The Worm Runner's Digest\\" (a feature of my college years) is no more. Nowadays hardly anyone believes that he can learn to play the piano by taking a pill, and Planaria are no longer forced to dine on their learned brethren.  Even more disturbing, James McConnell, the iconoclastic `Worm Runner General' himself was targeted late in his life by the Unabomber and suffered a permanent hearing impairment from the bomb blast---the unanticipated price of his brief moment of scientific fame.<br />\\"The Monks Who Saw the Moon Split Open\\"--- The mysterious birth of the Lunar Crater Giordano Bruno.  As reported by Ingram via the twelfth century \\"Chronicles of Gervase,\\" a group of five Englishmen saw \\"fire, hot coals, and sparks\\" bursting forth from the Moon on the evening of June 18, 1178. Did they witness the cataclysmic birth of Crater Giordano Bruno via asteroid impact?  Ingram argues that the location and age of the 22-kilometer (14-mile) lunar crater Giordano Bruno indicates that this was indeed the case.<br />However, a new study suggests the event was a meteoritic trick of the eye.<br />Paul Withers of the University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory argues that an impact large enough to create Giordano Bruno \\"would have triggered a blizzard-like, week-long meteor storm on Earth -- yet there are no accounts of such a storm in any known historical record.\\" Withers reports his analysis and other tests of the `crater' hypothesis in the journal of the Meteoritical Society \\"Meteoritics and Planetary Science.\\"<br />Read both Ingram's essay and Paul Withers's account (there is a summary at the Science@NASA home page) and decide for yourself whether five medieval Englishmen indeed witnessed the birth of a crater on our Moon.<br />\\"The Barmaid's Brain\\" is a lively collection of essays, well worth savoring one at time.

In the case of the Messmer family, evil skipped a generation then returned full force to destroy what remained of the good.<br />This sixth Gabriel Du Pr&eacute; mystery begins at an auction on the Messmer family ranch, about forty miles west of Toussaint.  The current owners died in a road accident and the one remaining son is selling almost all of the moveable property.  The FBI wants Du Pr&eacute; to keep an eye on the ranch and the surviving son, but he resists the request of Harvey Wallace, aka Harvey Weasel Fat, Blackfoot and FBI agent:<br />\\"'I am old, tired, want to drink, sleep, play a little music,' said Du Pr&eacute;.  `You call, I get no sleep, drink too much, don't play music, maybe get shot at, something.  Maybe I hang up, you call back I am gone, no one knows where.'\\"<br />Du Pr&eacute; doesn't disappear but his friend, the Shaman Benetsee does (at least, temporarily).  Something evil is afoot on the Messmer ranch, something so dangerous that Du Pr&eacute;'s long-time mistress, Madelaine decides to pay a visit to her Turtle Mountain kin.  Du Pr&eacute;, who is on the villains' hit list bunks up with his friends Bart and Booger Tom.<br />My problem with this Du Pr&eacute; mystery is that \\"Long Son\\"s plot loses needed focus about half way through.  The villains become more generic, as does their evil-doing.  Du Pr&eacute; puts his tracking skills to work at the ranch, and later at Benetsee's cabin, but his heart isn't really in the search---especially when it becomes clear that one of the villains has saved Du Pr&eacute;'s life.<br />Even as the plot tangles in on itself, the author, Peter Bowen moves from strength to strength in allowing his readers to experience the haunting, intensely familial, whisky-soaked lives of his M&eacute;tis characters.  `The Song of Genevette' is an old M&eacute;tis ballad whose verses Du Pr&eacute; must complete in order to find the murderer.  It also leads him into the heart of the evil that seeped down through generations of Messmers, and caused their ultimate doom.leads him into the heart of the evil that seeped down through generations of Messmers, and caused their ultimate doom.	2001-10-10

Readers of the initial novel may be surprised to learn that there is more than one type of demon, and not all of them are evil. Seyonne discovers one of these anomalous creatures upon entering a human soul to free it from demonic possession. He pursues his new theology of demons, even though it means alienating his best friend, losing his wife-Queen, collaborating with his worst (human) enemy, and giving himself up into the talons of his demonic foes.<br />&quot;Revelation&quot; is complex almost to the point of being over-plotted, although Seyonne's personality and moral convictions still drive the story. Lots of new characters (many of them demons) are introduced and their narratives are not concluded, which leads me to hope that there is going to be at least one more volume in this inventive and intelligent series (my favorite among all of the multi-volume fantasies currently in progress).<br />Carol Berg turns herself into the Poet Laureate of Demonland in &quot;Revelation.&quot; Once away from the torture pits of the Gastai (the lowest, most brutal caste of demons), Seyonne finds an unexpectedly beautiful world:<br />&quot;I blinked a hundred times to make sure I was not imagining it---a perfect frozen image of a butterfly. Not living, of course. Perfect only in shape and size and the detail of its patterned wings, for it was carved of the very stuff of winter, a fragile creature of frost. The coloration was quite faint, only a pale suggestion of the radiant reds and yellows and hard-edged black I knew were the reality. But there was such vivid truth in the shaping of it that I held my breath lest it startle, fly into the raging storm, and be shattered.&quot;<br />Ms. Berg if you are writing a sequel to &quot;Revelation,&quot; please don't fall into the habit of impaling your hero into ever more hideous torture scenes. Grim reading though they were, Seyonne's beatings, brandings, and premature burial seemed to be a 'natural' part of his story in &quot;Transformation.&quot; He was after all, a slave. However, some of his prolonged sufferings in &quot;Revelation&quot; seemed a tiny bit gratuitous. I'd be heart-broken if Seyonne's story degenerated into another S&amp;M fantasy series, in the manner of Terry Goodkind's &quot;Wizard's First Rule&quot; (which was excellent but for a single prolonged torture scene), &quot;Stone of Tears&quot; (much more gratuitous ichor and bruising), et cetera, ad nauseum.to ever more hideous torture scenes.

In the alternate universe that had been troubling his dreams, the body he now inhabits is supposed to be dead, too, but there was a hitch in the plot to murder Kaskar, crown prince of Ulad.  Thus Ramsey wakes up on a bier surrounded by flowers, candles, and guards who have been spelled into statues.<br />There is magic afoot in Ramsey's new world, and plots to murder or manipulate the new Kaskar-returned-from-the-dead.  He must quickly sort out his friends from his enemies.  His ability to dream true in this new universe makes him the wild card in any scheme to seize the throne of Ulad.<br />Ramsey-now-Kaskar has become the Knave of Dreams.<br />Norton tells a rousing, tightly paced adventure.  My only problem with \\"Knave of Dreams\\" is the reason for the original body-exchange.  Instead of swapping Kaskar into Ramsey's body and causing him to die in a car crash, why didn't the plotters just hold a pillow over his face or drown him in a butt of Malmsey?	2001-09-29

For one thing, the author is an award-winning sportswriter for the \\"New York Times.\\"  For another, he is a dedicated horse-player---Damon Runyon; bettin' on da gee-gees; bookies; \\"The Daily Racing Form\\"---that sort of scene.  Finally and perhaps most importantly, he owned and raced a Quarter Horse named Oh Desperado, who turned out to be a whiz at dressage.<br />Joe Drape begins his story in June, 1999 when the big, beautiful Charismatic, a former claiming horse fractured his foreleg in the Belmont, just seconds away from becoming the first Thoroughbred in twenty-one years to win the Triple Crown.  The book ends with Tiznow's victory in the 2000 Breeder's Cup Classic and the death of his eighty-three-year-old owner, Cecilia Straub-Rubens, three days later.<br />In between, Thoroughbred owners \\"spent $510,834,975 on 8,779 yearlings at auctions in the United States in hopes that one of them was the right horse for the 2002 Triple Crown.\\"<br />The author writes primarily of the owners and trainers, by turns foolish, determined, and hopeful, and some of whom were real S.O.B.s.  One of the prominent players is the trainer D. Wayne Lucas, who won the first two races in the Triple Crown in 1999, and then won the third leg in 2000.  He is also one of the aforementioned S.O.B.s---one might even call him the Patton of Thoroughbred training.  I finished this book with a tremendous admiration (although not liking) for Lucas, especially for winning the 2000 Belmont with a mediocre horse and sheer tactical brilliance.  The author is still kicking himself for not betting on Lucas's horse in that race.  It would have been his fifth winner on a Pick-Six ticket.<br />\\"The Race for the Triple Crown\\" is rich in the detail of what it takes to purchase a Thoroughbred at auction (lots of money, lots of testosterone, and lots of research).  It portrays the agony and ecstasy of owning, training, and riding a potential Triple Crown horse.  Here is the true story of the relationship between D. Wayne Lucas and Charismatic's jockey, Chris Antley.  Here's what it feels like to try and outbid a Maktoum at the Keeneland September Yearling Sale.  Here are the reasons why you shouldn't plan a celebratory dinner in advance of a Thoroughbred race.  Here is Bob Baffert, \\"intoning, `Houston, we got a problem' into the microphone at the 1996 Preakness when his horse Cavonnier was on his way to a fourth-place finish.\\"<br />This is an absolutely riveting story for readers who are already somewhat familiar with Thoroughbred racing.  I loved it.

He passed through the hands of a number of owners and trainers who thought he showed some promise as a runner, even though he was in the habit of ripping his feed tub off of the wall and hurling it down the shed row.  Once, when he was stabled at a track he didn't like, John Henry did the same thing to his trainer:<br />\\"After one of the races, [John Henry] returned to the barn and was given a bath.  Marino [his trainer] started walking him, and before he knew it, his jacket sleeve was in John's mouth.  John picked Marino up off the ground and took off down the shed row, dragging him along.  Marino was being lifted in the air and was completely helpless...'Thank God I had a goose down jacket or he would have taken a big chunk out of me,' Marino said.  `That's how mad the horse was.'\\"<br />Then the trainer, Ron McAnally took in the gelding that vented his anger on his water buckets, feed tubs, and sometimes his groom, and turned him into a demon on the race track.  How did the trainer do this?  McAnally says it was by treating him kindly and earning John Henry's trust.<br />The ugly little demon-turned-race-horse repaid his trainer's kindness by earning an amazing $6.6 million in eighty-three starts and thirty-nine wins.  His durability and courage became a legend, and he attracted record numbers of fans to the tracks where he ran.  He won his second `Horse of the Year' title and closed out his racing career at the advanced age of nine.<br />John Henry and his trainer, Ron McAnally were both elected to the Thoroughbred Hall of Fame in 1990, which was only fitting.<br />John is now spending his retirement at the Kentucky Horse Park, and is shown to his visitors three times a day during the season (March 15th through October 31st).

While separated from his patrol by a storm, he discovers the hilt of an ancient sword---an artifact of the vanished Great Adepts of magic.<br />Oh, no!  All WW fans know that ancient artifacts are better left untouched.  But Yonan feels a compulsion to rescue the sword hilt from its imprisoning stone, and so the original wielder of the Sword of Ice is able to reincarnate himself within Yonan.  Yonan-now-Tolar forges a magical blade for his sword, rescues his friend Uruk of the Ax from a pillar of ice, and together they hurtle back through time to refight the Lost Battle of Witch World.<br />Before they bid farewell to the present, Yonan-now-Tolar and Uruk rescue Yonan's childhood companion, the untrained witch, Crytha from the filthy, claustrophobic burrows of the Rasti.<br />Crytha then narrates the third story of the trilogy, \\"Sword of Shadows.\\"<br />An untrained witch is a very dangerous thing to be in Escore: a vessel waiting to be filled with the wrong kind of magic---which is exactly what happens to Crytha.  She is put under a strong compulsion to obey an evil female magician named Laidan, who is plotting to reincarnate her lover, an adept of the darkest shadow who originally perished in the Lost Battle.  (Evil females in Norton stories are easily identified by their scarlet lips and wanton behavior.)<br />How Crytha manages to foil the adepts of the Dark, with unexpected assistance from one of the Great Ones who had withdrawn from Witch World after the Lost Battle is the essence of \\"Sword of Shadows.\\"<br />My only reason for withholding a star from my review is the very loosely constructed plot of \\"Trey of Swords.\\"  I never did quite comprehend why the Lost Battle of Witch World had to be refought.  A more favorable outcome to the ancient battle didn't seem to change anything in `modern-day' Escore---at least not by book's end.

Terra itself is nothing but a half-remembered legend of origin.<br />Norton combines a theory of parallel universes with themes from folklore to create her story of a changeling who drags her brother and governess out of the twenty-fifth century AF (After Flight) and into the world of Faerie.<br />It's an odd amalgamation, but I think it works well because her story is anchored by the governess, Kilda and her brave attempts to rescue her charges.  Almost as soon as she meets the children, Kilda realizes that the girl Bartare has some kind of unnatural hold over her younger brother, Oomark.  The governess does everything she can to solve the mystery of Bartare's invisible `Dread Companion'---invisible that is, until Kilda and her charges are yanked into Faerie.<br />Kilda has to drink the water of Faerie before she can even see properly.  The boy Oomark stays with her, but eats freely of alien fruit.  When Kilda finally regains her normal vision, Oomark has begun a physical transformation into a creature of hooves and horns---a faun.  Kilda must now struggle to stay human, locate a gate back to the sane world of the 25th century, keep Oomark by her side, and find Bartare who has gone to join the Dread Companion she believes to be her true mother.<br />\\"Dread Companion\\" was published in 1970, sandwiched between the Witch World novels, \\"Sorceress of the Witch World\\" (1968) and \\"The Crystal Gryphon\\" (1972), as well as many other works by this prolific author.  Norton fans will discern several common elements between her excellent Witch World fantasy series and this stand-alone SF novel.  Examples: there are nurturing trees that are havens from evil hound- and vulture-like creatures; and Bartare's kidnapper turns out to be a Great One of the Light---not that it matters so unhuman is She.<br />I think if you can find a copy of \\"Dread Companion,\\" you will read some of the best descriptions of Faerie ever written, even though this book is officially classified as science fiction.<br />Norton has written of a place that is wondrous, terrible, and truly alien.s out to be a Great One of the Light---not that it matters so unhuman is She.<br />I think if you can find a copy of \\"Dread Companion,\\" you will read some of the best descriptions of Faerie ever written, even though this book is officially classified as science fiction.<br />Norton has written of a place that is wondrous, terrible, and truly alien.	2001-09-18

For most of us it was our first experience in what another commentator called `in-your-face terrorism.'<br />Now, we need to understand why we were attacked. We need to understand the history and motivation of our enemies. We need to understand the historical and religious background of our friends in the Islamic World.<br />\\"The Sword of the Prophet\\" is an excellent place to begin a journey of understanding. It was published in 1973 and begins explosively with the so-called `Yom Kippur' war. In his introduction, Goldston tells us (a bit too optimistically, I'm afraid):<br />\\"As Americans, under the pressure of urgent necessity, took a new look at the Arab world, the fog of prejudice began to lift from a colorful, noble, and fascinating historical landscape. In that landscape they could discern the real meaning of many hitherto puzzling movements and events---and in it too they could find the roots of much that was vital in their own past. For the history of Islam, it turned out, was an integral part of the heritage of all peoples, a part of the human story that had its origins in remote and even legendary times...\\"<br />If you didn't read \\"Sword of the Prophet\\" back when it was first published, there is still time to do so. Since this is a brief, 211-page book, the author of necessity presents a very panoramic view of the beginnings of Islam and how it became such a unifying force---a little more than a hundred years after the time of Mohammed, the Arabs created an empire that stretched from the Pyrenees to the Himalayas. They didn't relinquish the last of their strongholds in Spain until 1492. Their armies were still hammering at the gates of Vienna in 1683.<br />How Islam conquered its enemies and why, the rise and fall of a succession of Islamic empires, and the causes of Islam's fiery reawakening after World War II are all vividly and succinctly presented in \\"The Sword of the Prophet.\\"<br />Americans who want to understand the difficulties of our potential crusade against Osama bin Laden should read Goldston's (very brief) account of the Hashashin and the Old Man of the Mountains.<br />Other books that are both readable and touch more deeply on the history and meaning of Islam are \\"The Age of Faith\\" by Will Durant, \\"A History of the Arab Peoples\\" by Albert Hourani, and \\"Islam,\\" edited by John Alden Williams.How Islam conquered its enemies and why, the rise and fall of a succession of Islamic empires, and the causes of Islam's fiery reawakening after World War II are all vividly and succinctly presented in \\"The Sword of the Prophet.\\"<br />Americans who want to understand the difficulties of our potential crusade against Osama bin Laden should read Goldston's (very brief) account of the Hashashin and the Old Man of the Mountains.<br />Other books that are both readable and touch more deeply on the history and meaning of Islam are \\"The Age of Faith\\" by Will Durant, \\"A History of the Arab Peoples\\" by Albert Hourani, and \\"Islam,\\" edited by John Alden Williams.	2001-09-14

Andre Norton had already published more than forty novels when \\"Eye of the Monster\\" was released in 1962.  This was well before Arnold Schwarznegger won his first Mr. Junior Europe title and went on to greater glory in his first film, \\"Hercules Goes to New York\\" (1970).  However, Ms. Norton must have someone like him in mind to play the role of her hero, Rees Naper in \\"Eye of the Monster.\\"<br />Rees goes crashing through Ishkurian jungles &agrave; la Arnold in \\"The Predator,\\" blasting the alien `Crocs' who went on a killing rampage of their own:<br />\\"Then the warning hit him; the musky, nauseatingly strong odor of Crocs in a killing rage.  It could be that some were near now, or it could be the lingering reminder of a recent visit, or attack.<br />\\"Crouching low, he began to move towards the lab.  On the office threshold he halted.  A croc lay dead at his feet.<br />\\"The body pinned by darts to the desk inside was his uncle.\\"<br />The author gives us a tense, thrill-a-minute tale as her hero rescues two children and a woman from what was left of a missionary camp and a trading station.  However, \\"Eye of the Monster\\" is very atypical Norton, even though one of the children and the woman happen to be Salariki---the feline aliens first introduced in \\"Plague Ship (1956).\\"  I think the author must have set herself the task of writing a pure \\"Bullard of the Space Patrol\\" SF thriller before immersing herself in the mysticism and magic of her `Witch World' fantasies.<br />Andre Norton (born Alice Mary Norton) was the first woman to receive the Gandalf Grand Master of Fantasy and the Nebula Grand Master Award, so you will still enjoy a well-crafted thriller in \\"Eye of the Monster.\\"  However Rees Naper is a more muscular, blaster-happy hero than her usual run of intuitive, plucky, sometimes handicapped main characters.  I will even venture to guess that she got tired of Naper, since this book ends rather abruptly.<br />We never do learn why the Crocs went on a rampage or how they managed to steal and operate their advanced technology weapons.  However, Naper and his band of survivors manage to escape the gristly fate of their former companions and kin.managed to steal and operate their advanced technology weapons.

Because of his new-found ability to communicate with his wolverines, he also establishes first contact with Warlocks mysterious, semi-aquatic Wyverns.<br />Storm over Warlock is one of Nortons finest SF adventure novels, equally as exotic and exciting as her Plague Ship or Lord of Thunder.  Her hero Shann not only needs to overcome the prejudice of his own kind and survive on a strange new world, he must also learn how to earn the trust of his companions, the wolverines Taggi and Togi.<br />Nortons non-human characters, whether they be wolverines or Wyverns are fully-realized, sentient beings.  They are not pushovers for pathetic, starving humans, no matter how plucky and likeable.  Shann has to earn his own way with them.<br />We, her readers must also earn our way.  We must never expect to fully understand how a wolverine or Wyvern thinks.  We must learn to accept them as our equals, no matter what their shape or thought-processes.<br />Andre Norton keeps us turning the pages, not only for the cliff-hangers that Shann gets himself into, but also for the tantalizing glimpses into the minds of her non-human characters.	2001-09-08

This classical suspense novel, first published in 1937 might be difficult to follow for readers who are not already familiar with Shakespeare's &quot;The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince Denmark.&quot;<br />However, it is well worth reading, not only for the richly allusive mystery, but also for the characters who create and act out its tragedy. The author engraves his brittle, upper-class English in diamond-point prose. He etches their wit with acid. They are never dull. To misquote the Bard himself, &quot;Age cannot wither Innes's characters, nor murder stale their witty dialogue.&quot;<br />For the length of the tragedy at least, the reader will inhabit the manor and precincts of Scamnum Court, principal seat of the Duke of Horton---&quot;It is a big place: two counties away it has a sort of little brother in Blenheim Palace.&quot;<br />After the second murder of the evening, C.I.D. Inspector John Appleby gives the reader his impression of the place, while searching through its corridors for the Duchess of Horton:<br />&quot;Moving about Scamnum at night, it seemed to Appleby, was like moving in a dream through some monstrously overgrown issue of 'Country Life.' Great cubes of space, disconcertingly indeterminate in function--- were they rooms or passages? ---flowed past in the half-darkness with the intermittent coherence of distant music, now composed into order and proportion, now a vague and raw material for the architectonics of the imagination...He recalled the great palaces --- now for the most part tenantless --- which the eighteenth century had seen rise, all weirdly of a piece, about Europe. Scamnum, he knew, was to be a different pattern; would reveal itself in the morning as being --- however augustly --- the home of an English gentleman and a familiar being. But now it was less a human dwelling than a dream-symbol of centuries of rule, a fantasy created from the tribute of ten thousand cottages long perished from the land.&quot;<br />Everything in &quot;Hamlet, Revenge!&quot; is done on a grand scale. The Duchess of Horton persuades her old friend, the Lord Chancellor of England to act the part of Polonius in her amateur production of &quot;Hamlet.&quot; Her husband is cast as Claudius, King of Denmark and she herself plays his Queen. Their daughter, Elizabeth is Ophelia. The greatest Shakespearean actor of the day plays the Melancholy Dane.<br />All of the play's characters are put on edge by a series of mysterious messages, culminating in a quotation from &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;...there shall be done a deed of dreadful note...&quot; Then the Lord Chancellor is shot to death at the very instant in the play when his character is supposed to die by Hamlet's sword.<br />Appleby is called in to solve a murder that &quot;was planned, deliberately and at obvious risk, to take place bang in the middle of a private performance of Hamlet.&quot;<br />The young C.I.D. Inspector is also charged with recovering vital State documents that the second-most important figure in British government had with him when he motored down to Scamnum Court to strut and fret upon the ducal stage. Until the very end of &quot;Hamlet, Revenge!&quot; the reader can never be sure if he or she is reading a murder mystery or a spy story.<br />&quot;Hamlet, Revenge!&quot; in my opinion is one of the top ten mysteries of the last century, reaching the same rarified heights as Sayers's &quot;The Nine Tailors.&quot; It is much less known to American readers, possibly because of its author's richly allusive style.

(The Duke also plays a prominent role in the early Appleby mystery,  \\"Hamlet, Revenge!\\" (1937).)<br />This story begins when Lady Judith drags her unsuspecting husband off to a memorial exhibition of the works of Gavin Limbert, a young artist who was thought to have committed suicide.  When Limbert's `chef d'oeuvre' is stolen from the gallery, right under Appleby's nose, he feels compelled to reopen the case on the painter's mysterious demise.<br />Appleby's assistant, Inspector Cadover is already acquainted with the case and he serves as a stiff upper-lip to his chief's intuitive, sometimes playful method of investigation.  When Appleby disappears after a nocturnal ruckus in a junk shop, Cadover takes over the case and brings it to a successful conclusion---just as he later takes on Appleby's role at New Scotland Yard after Sir John's retirement (for more about Cadover, read \\"The Case of the Journeying Boy\\" by Michael Innes (1949).)<br />This particular Appleby is an equal mixture of mystery and adventure---Appleby personally engages the villains in glorious, but somewhat ignominious battle; Judith hides in a closet and overhears an artist plotting murder, etc.  There is a wonderful chase scene that ends when Lady Judith and the Duke of Horton save Appleby from a particularly appalling fate.<br />Don't let the author's gift for playful, erudite dialogue disguise his mastery of character.  \\"One-Man Show\\" contains a portrait of an amnesiac young woman that is probably the most sensitive and believable in all of mystery literature (eat your heart out, Dame Agatha!)appalling fate.<br />Don't let the author's gift for playful, erudite dialogue disguise his mastery of character.  \\"One-Man Show\\" contains a portrait of an amnesiac young woman that is probably the most sensitive and believable in all of mystery literature (eat your heart out, Dame Agatha!)	2001-09-03

That honor goes to a classic Tudor manor house at Sandford Orcas in Dorset.  \\"It is reputed to be haunted by over a dozen ghosts...When I entered its ancient gateway (where one of the current ghosts hanged himself from a pulley still to be seen), I found the appearance of the house to be exactly right for the part.

The scene of the crime is a plush love nest on the outskirts of Paris where Rose Klonec had her midnight rendezvous with Death. Not one but four different murder weapons are found in the room with her corpse. The table is set for a feast. Champagne abounds.<br /> Bencolin must determine which one of her lovers or ex-lovers hated her enough to murder her---or was it a stranger, uninvited to the feast?<br /> John Dickson Carr assembles a dashing, dissolute group of suspects that includes a reformed playboy, a high-stakes gambler, and a beautiful, young woman whose father was hanged for murder. His Bencolin mysteries always include the following:<br /> * A beautiful, neurasthenic young woman who at some point in the plot becomes the main suspect, and/or becomes convinced that she committed murder.<br /> * A square-jawed Englishman who falls in love with the beautiful, but somewhat hysterical young woman. The Englishman also serves as Bencolin's foil and eagerly pursues all of the plot's red herrings.<br /> * A very complex mystery that usually involves a `locked room,' false murder weapons, complicated time-tables, and air-tight alibis (at least for the villains).<br /> *<br />A decadent, hot-house atmosphere, sometimes with a suggestion of the supernatural. Unspeakable horror always lurks just down the dark, crimson-carpeted hall. All of the characters end up hyper-ventilating, not just the beautiful, young heroine.<br />I read the John Dickson Carr mysteries for their atmosphere. There is no other author who has such a wonderful sense of the lurid. In \\"The Four False Weapons,\\" he takes us to a 1920s Parisian gambling club where only the very rich are invited to play. It is nicknamed the Corpses' Club, and the game that its members play was invented for the noblemen in the court of Louis, the Sun King. Vast sums can be won or lost at the turn of a single card. In this scene, the owner of the club, Madame de la Tours&egrave;che has just explained how the game of Basset is played:<br /> \\"'Mesdames, messieurs, shall we play?'<br />\\"There was a dead silence.<br /> \\"Curtis [the square-jawed young Englishman] had expected some outburst, some comment at least, as at the end of any explanation. There was none. The stocky little man sat and looked thoughtfully (hungrily, you might have said) at the edge of the green baize. The two women across the room were very still; but he heard the click of a purse being opened....Beside this merry little invention of the court of Louis the Fourteenth, the stakes of even the greatest present-day gamblers looked like pennies. It was a long chance, of course. It was an almost inconceivable chance. But that is what makes Chance itself.<br />\\" Let the game begin!

This encyclopedia includes all of the world's butterflies, arranged in four family groups: the swallowtails (Papilionidae); the whites and sulfurs (Pieridae); the brush-footed butterflies (Nymphalidae); and the hairstreaks, coppers, and blues (Lycaenidae).<br />According to the author, this is the first butterfly encyclopedia to exclude the skippers (Hesperiidae), as they are now thought to show more similarities to moths than to butterflies. Also, butterflies previously classified as separate families, i.e. Satyridae, Danaidae, Nymphalidae, and Libytheidae are combined here as one family, Nymphalidae, \\"since they have one overriding characteristic: four functional legs. Their first pair of legs are [sic] redundant: they do not function for locomotion.\\" As soon as I read the author's allegation that Nymphalidae had only four functional legs, I rushed out into the backyard. As luck would have it, the first two butterflies I spotted--- a Monarch and a smaller Painted Lady---were both perched on the butterfly bush using only four legs! The Cabbage butterflies over on the zinnias had six legs apiece. Dr. Feltwell, who is an internationally recognized expert on butterflies and who serves as a consultant on the management of butterfly farms in the United States and Great Britain was right! Isn't it odd how after a lifetime of watching butterflies, I never noticed the difference between families until a book like this pointed it out to me? Three things will probably prevent \\"The Encyclopedia of Butterflies\\" from being used as a field guide: it is quite a large book; it covers too much territory (the whole earth); and its familial classification scheme doesn't really support a quick field identification.<br />However, it is a marvelous `rainy day' book. The photographs are gorgeous, and the clearly-written text covers all of the major butterfly families in detail, including taxonomy, structure, life cycle, migration pattern, habitat, and protected status.

Normally the phrase `psychological study' would be the kiss of death for a fantasy, but Sean Stewart's characters are the opposite of pretentious, navel-gazers. They're introspective, but they're also over-achievers and likeable to boot. His hero, Shielder's Mark is a shrewd young commoner who succeeds in shattering an age-old spell and winning the hand of a princess. He then blunders through the courtly landscape and into marriage, wears an awful hat through much of the book because the woman he loves made it for him (out of a corset and badly dyed leather), and forges his own demesne out of land that no one else would have because it was haunted. Sean Stewart tells his tale of \\"Nobody's Son\\" almost backwards---or at least his real story begins where most fairy tales end---in the `happily ever after.' Time itself shuttles backward, forward, round and round like an industrious orb-weaver. Shielder's Mark crosses a bridge that collapsed fifty generations past. He accidentally conjures up a dead hero and steals his sword. He loans his own sword to a man whose bones crumble to dust the next morning. In his `happily ever after,' Mark learns that he now must vanquish the ghosts he let back into the world when he destroyed the spell of the Red Keep. He also needs to learn that his \\"strange, proud, fierce, fox-faced\\" princess-bride, \\"chose him as much as he chose her.\\" Read this Aurora Award winner for its engaging characters, for its wonderful, offbeat love story, and for the dire spell of the Red Keep, where Shielder's Mark must confront his own past and intervene in a patricide that took place before he was born.	2001-08-24

I recently completed \\"The Arm of the Stone\\" by Victoria Strauss, which was a similarly themed fantasy.  Of the two, I think \\"Reflecting Fires\\" has the edge in philosophical soundness and character credibility.<br />Tom Claburn is a new, lyrical voice in the clich&eacute;d realms of fantasy.  His inventive use of language and symbols reminds me of Gene Wolfe's creative word-play in his multi-volume series, \\"The Book of the New Sun.\\"<br />Wolfe says in \\"The Shadow of the Torturer,\\" &quot;We believe that we invent symbols. The truth is that they invent us; we are their creatures, shaped by their hard, defining edges.\\"<br />Claburn creates a whole new religion in \\"Reflecting Fires,\\" along with the necessary accouterments of ritual, vocabulary, and symbolism.  It demands a careful reading, but the author rewards us by logically evolving his characters within the `hard, defining edges' of his theology.<br />The magic in \\"Reflecting Fires\\" tends toward subtlety.  In the following scene, Cardinal Skye begins to teach his new apprentice, an almost blind boy named Flux, the rudiments of magic:<br />\\"Skye smiled almost imperceptibly.  `Then let this be your first lesson.  Listen: `Flux killed the spider,' `Flux caused the spider to die.'  Which is the stronger phrase?'<br />\\"Flux thought for a moment. `The first one?'<br />Skye nodded and reached down to pick something up.  `But why?'<br />\\"'I do not know.'<br />The Cardinal placed a spider on Flux's hand.  Flux shivered and tried not to squirm.<br />\\"...'The bright mechanics is the language of possibility, and with further study you will be able to shape the possible into the actual...All the possibilities will yield to the one you have described, and it will be so.'<br />\\"Without a perceptible action from the Cardinal, the tickling spider footfalls on Flux's wrist stopped abruptly.  The spider was dead.\\"<br />However, no religion can survive without change, not even a magical one.<br />Toward the end of \\"Reflecting Fires,\\" Claburn gives his carefully woven theology a yank, and his characters must scramble to redefine what they believe.  One of them asks Dahlia (one of the main characters and a priestess):<br />\\"'What will become of us if the gods speak to everyone?  What use will a celebrant be?'<br />\\"'We will manage somehow,' Dahlia said.  `Perhaps we will reinvent ourselves.'\\"<br />Just as in the `real' world, Claburn continues to evolve his characters and their gods until the surprising, complex, and satisfying end of \\"Reflecting Fires.\\"out a perceptible action from the Cardinal, the tickling spider footfalls on Flux's wrist stopped abruptly.

This is one of the inns whose history the author narrates in loving detail.  It has a heroine, Dorothy Forster, whose deeds outstripped those found in the wildest of fictional romances.<br />Her spirit is supposed to haunt the hotel that was once her home.<br />Many of the inns in this book started life as a manor house or abbey.  An exception is the `Ferry Boat Inn' of Holywell, whose ghost supposedly lived her brief, mortal life during the reign of the Saxon King, Edward the Confessor!  In the \\"Guinness Book of Records,\\" the `Ferry Boat' lays serious claim to being the oldest hostelry in England.<br />\\"The White Lady who haunts the Ferry Boat Inn in the very heart of the legend-ridden Huntingdonshire fenland, is probably the longest established ghost to glide mysteriously in any English hostelry.  Yet the fascination of her tragic story has not diminished during the last ten centuries.

Who among us doesn't hiccup, eat vegetables, or experience the occasional twitch in an eyelid?<br />According to Weingarten, all of these seemingly harmless activities can lead to our imminent demise, accompanied by horrible pain and distressing body noises.<br />For instance, the only place where we probably can't get cancer is the lens of our eye.<br />Then there is this really gross tumor called a \\"teratoma\\" that can have teeth and hair.  If you ever bit the head off of one of those ugly little Smurf® dolls when you were a kid (or as part of a fraternity initiation rite when you were still a kid but had the body of an adult), then picture it as wandering to a sensitive portion of your anatomy and MUTATING!!!<br />Whew!<br />Even the author had trouble finding anything humorous about cancer.  He tried asking an oncologist, \\"So, Doctor, what's funny about cancer?\\"<br />\\"'Let's see,' [the oncologist] said.  `Humor.  OK, what is the difference between Sloan-Kettering and Shea Stadium?'<br />\\"Dunno, I said.<br />\\"'At Sloan-Kettering, the mets always win.'<br />\\"Ha ha, I said.  What?<br />\\"'See, `mets' is an abbreviation for `metastasis,' which is a cancer that has spread systemically from one organ or system to another.'<br />\\"Ah.<br />\\"A desperate silence filled the room.\\"<br />I suppose if I had to stagger off of this mortal coil, \\"beer potomania\\" wouldn't be such a bad way to go (compared to most of the other diseases in this book).  People who drink in excess of eight quarts of beer per day can accumulate too much water in their blood (I guess the liver hogs all of the beer), which leads to confusion, lethargy, and death.<br />Moral:  don't mix water with your beer.<br />The low point of \\"The Hypochondriac's Guide to Life and Death\\" might be Chapter 20, \\"Oh, Crap (Diagnosis by the Process of Elimination),\\" wherein the author interviews a gastroenterologist who specializes in flatulence.  This is the chapter I quoted most extensively to my friends.<br />Amazon.com won't let me quote the same passages for you, so buy this book and read it.<br />If you'd like to learn more about the author, Gene Weingarten, read Dave Barry's introduction before taking the plunge into Chapter 01, and figuring out which disease is going to take you down the drain.ews a gastroenterologist who specializes in flatulence.

David Berkowitz spent fifty years as a violist in the Met orchestra pit, and he had many more tales to tell, and at least one more conductor (James Levine) to critique.  Unfortunately, he passed away from lymphoma in 1989.<br />From some of the flattering remarks he made about Levine, I believe Berkowitz was going to give the current conductor of the Metropolitan Opera a thumbs-up.  However that was not chiseled in stone.  The Met violist critiqued the technique and personality of many a conductor, both famous and obscure.  Two of his favorites (both for their musicianship and for their professional treatment of the orchestra) were Leonard Bernstein and Dimitri Mitropoulos.<br />Although he despised Herbert Von Karajan's Nazi background, Berkowitz felt he was the best Wagnerian conductor he had ever worked under.  He regretted that Von Karajan fell into a dispute with Rudolph Bing, the Met's General Manager, and left after directing only two out of the four operas in Wagner's Ring Cycle.<br />The members of the Metropolitan Opera orchestra would probably have picked Fritz Reiner as their least popular conductor.  For many years, the musicians conspired to keep him out of the Met, for his reputation and rumors of his conducting style had filtered out of Pittsburg:<br />\\"I must explain too that Reiner often used a very short baton and if you sat at the rear of the orchestra, it looked like a toothpick, especially to the bass players who were strung out at the rear of the orchestra pit...There is a famous story about a bass player in the Pittsburg Symphony who came in to rehearsal with a telescope on a stand which he focused on Reiner's baton.  Reiner stopped the rehearsal and said, `Young man, what are you doing?'  The bassist answered, `Maestro, I brought the telescope to see your beat better.'  Reiner was furious and dismissed him on the spot.\\"<br />Reiner finally did spend several years at the Met, and Berkowitz judged him to be quite a gentleman---at least compared to his fellow-maestro, George Szell!<br />Anecdotes abound concerning the musicians who shared the orchestra pit with Berkowitz (oboists in particular seemed to him to be a very strange breed), and he also tells stories about the singers who trod (some more heavily than others) the stage above them.<br />\\"Behind the Gold Curtain\\" is most especially the autobiography of a fine musician who spent fifty years with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, and who struggled to keep his family fed and clothed through the Great Depression, the war years, and the inflationary years following the war.  Berkowitz supplemented his Met income by selling insurance and playing at summer festivals.  One of his pit-mates bet on horses.<br />Benefits accumulated very gradually until by the time Berkowitz retired, the Met musicians were finally earning salaries and benefits on par with other world-class orchestras.  It was a long, hard struggle especially during the Bing years, and Berkowitz was proud of the part he played in obtaining a better living for himself and his fellow-musicians.<br />Speaking of struggles, the author also complains that there were no women in the Met's orchestra pit (except for a pair of harpists) until the Metropolitan Opera started to hold blind auditions.  Once the aspiring musicians were concealed from the judges (the conductor and a committee of orchestra members) and had to be judged on the merit of their playing, \\"this was the beginning of the influx of female musicians [into the Met Orchestra].\\"  He was especially proud of the fact that his own daughter, Phebe Berkowitz became the Metropolitan Opera's Executive Stage Director.<br />My only regret is that David Berkowitz didn't live long enough to complete his story about \\"a period particularly dear to his heart---the era of James Levineas Musical Director [of the Metropolitan Opera].\\"sical Director [of the Metropolitan Opera].\\"	2001-08-13

It was a shallow, burning pain rather like someone had injected a weak solution of hydrochloric acid under my skin.  About a third of my forehead was flushed red when I first looked in a mirror, but the redness subsided within a few hours, leaving a dime-sized lump that is still visible a week later.<br /><br />I used \\"Spiders and Their Kin\\" to tentatively identify the mangled remains of the spider as a small Brown Recluse (`Loxosceles reclusa').  Just in case I needed to go see my doctor, I put the spider into a baggie and froze it.  Luckily, my forehead didn't dissolve---according to the Levis, \\"In severe cases...the wound grows deeper and does not heal for several months.\\"<br /><br />At any rate, \\"Spiders and Their Kin\\" is a handy book to have around.  I bought a copy for my sister when she found what she thought was a Black Widow in her garage, and I also got a copy for myself in order to identify the gigantic black and yellow spider that was hanging head-down in my Japanese Spiraea (it was---or maybe I should say, she was a Black and Yellow Argiope (`A. aurantia').<br /><br />When I first bought this book, just looking at the cover made me itch.  However, it is filled with fascinating little tidbits about Arachnids and their kin.  I used to think that Hairy Mygalomorphs were the ugliest spiders on Earth (most especially the ones with ten inch leg spans), but now my vote goes to the Pirate Spiders (`Mimetidae').  Luckily, they are small spiders (4 - 6 mm), so you would have to use a magnifying glass to get the full impact of one of these hairy little dudes.<br /><br />It is really rather impolite of me to make fun of `Mimetidae,' since they help beautify my backyard by eating other spiders.  According to the authors:<br /><br />\\"Pirate Spiders invade webs of other spiders.  The slow-moving Pirate Spider bites the web owner, which is quickly paralyzed and sucked dry through the legs, one after another.\\"<br /><br />Sounds like someone dining on crab legs.<br /><br />The only fault I can find with \\"Spiders and Their Kin\\" is that it doesn't go into enough detail on the individual species and subspecies of Arachnids.  And that's not a fair criticism to make, since Golden Nature Guides are meant to be used for quick identification, not detailed research.<br /><br />Now, I've got to work up my courage, venture outside, and try to identify that big brown spider that has built her web from the house electrical line down to the clematis beside the porch door.  Her abdomen is wider than it is long, she has striped legs, and she only comes out after dark...<br /><br />By the way, \\"Spiders and their Kin\\" has a useful chapter on `Collecting Spiders.'  If you're an arachnophobe like I am, learning more about these critters might be the quickest way to cure yourself.<br /><br />P.S.  For those of you who don't believe that Brown Recluse spiders live as far north as Michigan, last year one of the ladies in our bridge group was bitten by a Brown Recluse and spent three days in the hospital.  This incident occurred in Houghton Lake, Michigan which is in the northern reaches of the Mitten./><br />Sounds like someone dining on crab legs.<br /><br />The only fault I can find with \\"Spiders and Their Kin\\" is that it doesn't go into enough detail on the individual species and subspecies of Arachnids.

It is third in a series of mysteries starring Gabriel Du Pr&eacute;, the M&eacute;tis descendant of French Voyageurs and Plains Indians, and it is rabidly anti-environmentalist and pro-rancher.<br />Rabid or not, such is the power of Bowen's writing and the nobility of his characters that even clean, green bunny-huggers (like me) might end up voting for the ranchers and against the re-introduction of wolves into Big Sky Country at story's end.<br />All of the regulars at Touissant Bar are part of the action in \\"Wolf, No Wolf.\\"  Du Pr&eacute;, master fiddler and part-time brand inspector is cast in the role of peacemaker. With help from his friends, the Shaman Benetsee, Bart the rich-guy-turned-sheriff, Du Pr&eacute;'s long-time mistress, Madelaine, and Booger Tom, the ancient, homicidal cowhand, he braves avalanches, gunfire, and false medicine men in order to prevent open warfare between the ranchers and the Earth First! crowd.<br />There are good ranchers, and there are really evil ranchers who sell dead horses for dogmeat.<br />There are good FBI agents (not very many) who are either Montanans and/or part Amerindian.  The vast majority of agents are feeble, clueless, and from out-of-state.  Some of them are so dim-witted as to try and arrest the Shaman Benetsee, who plays a wonderful joke on them with his coyotes. (A previous reviewer compared Benetsee to Yoda.  Boys and girls, that reviewer was dead-on.  Lucasfilm© should take Peter Bowen to court for kidnapping.)<br />All of the environmentalists, New Age mystics, and Yuppies in \\"Wolf, No Wolf\\" are easily identified by their expensive, crassly-colored, mail-order garments of many pockets.  They are even dumber than the FBI agents, and are easily led astray, even unto death, by the book's true evil empire (sorry, Lucasfilm©).<br />And die they do, by avalanche and grizzly, by gunshot and knife, and by freezing to death in Alberta Clippers.  The ranchers rescue as many as they can, but winter in Montana is truly hell-frozen-over.  Some of Bowen's leanest, most vivid prose is devoted to descriptions of out-landers and cattle that venture out into the jaws of a Blue Northerly.<br />Better to stay in the Touissant Bar and drink fizzy, pink, screw-top wine, and listen to Du Pr&eacute; fiddle the sad, old Voyageur songs.rescue as many as they can, but winter in Montana is truly hell-frozen-over.

He began this book while assigned to Rhodes as an information officer in 1945, and finally finished it in Belgrade in 1952 while working as a press attach&eacute; for the British Embassy.  Before publication, it was chopped almost in half by his editor, Anne Ridler.  She excised most of the passages dealing with the recent war, and \\"left the descriptions of the landscape and people....She oriented the book to sunlight, blue skies, and clear sea.\\" [quoted from the introduction David Roessel].<br />War still clings like a gray film to the bright fabric of `Venus.'  Durrell writes intense, brilliant descriptions of Mediterranean skies and dazzling Greek villages, but as in all of his works that I've read, there is also a submerged longing for past love, past history,  past glory.<br />Some of his most beautiful passages, both in this book, in \\"Prospero's Cell,\\" and in the books of \\"The Alexandria Quartet\\" take place under water.  Here, the author goes for a midnight swim in the final chapter of \\"Reflections on a Marine Venus\\"---<br />\\"The [moon]light filters down a full fathom or more to where, on the dark blackboard of weed, broken here and there by dazzling areas of milk-white sand, the fish float as if dazed by their own violet shadows which follow them back and forth, sprawling across the sea's floor.\\"<br />Bright surfaces.  Submerged longings.  There is even a ghost story floating just below the surface of a trip to the Island of Patmos.  This chapter has some of the most powerful and eerie descriptions in the book.  It brings together the storms of the `little summer of Saint Demetrius', a lost, lingering voice from the war, and an Abbot who presides over a monastery where St. John was said to have composed the Books of the Apocalypse.<br />\\"Reflections on a Marine Venus\\" is one of a series of travelogues that Durrell wrote about his pre- and post-war experiences in and around the Mediterranean.

He was educated at Oriel College, Oxford, and his mysteries reflect both his scholarship (the title of this book is from a poem by Thomas Hardy), and the year he spent in Vienna, studying Freudian psychoanalysis.<br />The setting of `Journeying Boy' (1949) is a product of the two years Innes spent at Queen's University in Belfast. I believe it is the only one of his mysteries to take place in Ireland.  It is also notable in that it does not feature his most famous detective, Sir John Appleby, but rather Appleby's successor at New Scotland Yard, Detective-Inspector Thomas Cadover. The new Inspector is a bit of a dry stick compared to the irrepressible Appleby---he refers to his predecessor as `the wayward Appleby'---but Cadover detects with the best of his literary kin (Appleby, Lord Peter, Professor Fen, etc.) All of the characters are introspective (remember that year in Vienna) and finely drawn.  No caricatures are to be found in `Journeying Boy'---not even the nuclear physicist.<br />Not even the Irish.<br />The narrative duties are divided between three main characters:  Inspector Cadover; Humphrey Paxton, the adolescent son of a famous nuclear physicist; and Richard Thewless, the middle-aged and somewhat unimaginative tutor who is hired to take Humphrey on a vacation to Ireland.  As always with Innes, the mystery is a mixture of high drama and low farce.  `Journeying Boy' doesn't quite venture into the surreal depths of some of the Appleby novels.  However, Innes displays his talent for hallucinatory description in several places, including a scene where the tutor, Mr. Thewless is stumbling through the dark halls of a draughty, decaying Irish country house.  Just as he becomes certain that he is being followed, his candle gutters out:<br />\\"All of the objects...that lined the broad corridors of the house were swathed in a white sheeting from which one could have puffed the dust in passing.  The effect could not well be other than spectral.  It was as if, in addition to the [mansion's family and servants], the place owned another body of inhabitants, who waited, shrouded and silent in the gathering dusk, the stroke of some hour that should release them to their own nocturnal offices.  Nor indeed did their silence appear entire, since the wind as it sighed through Killyboffin had the effect of prompting them to sinister confabulation, the result of which was...an uneasy twitch and stir in their enveloping garments.\\"<br />Even though `Journeying Boy' mentions Appleby only in passing, it is one of Innes's best, most intricate mysteries.  This author can switch from farce to horror better and faster than any of his contemporaries.  You'll be laughing while your hair is still standing straight up on the back of your neck.  If you don't believe me, read the chapter that takes place in a labyrinth of sea caves, where the boy Humphrey attempts to escape from his enemies.<br />Michael Innes is one of the finest, most unjustly neglected authors from the British Golden Age of Mystery.

If you haven't already discovered him, try starting with \\"The Case of the Journeying Boy,\\" or his very literate Appleby mystery, \\"Hamlet, Revenge!\\"	2001-08-04

They are about ghostly lighthouse keepers and/or drowned sailors.<br />The worst stories are ghostly bodice-rippers that the author made up whole-cloth.  I'm not certain why they were included in the book, except that the phantasmagoric romances are set in or near a lighthouse.<br />The author tells a very energetic story, sequined with multiple adjectives and adverbs.  The characters are \\"groping and gasping,\\" \\"tormented by a disturbing past,\\" \\"trying to calm the banging of [their] hearts.\\"  They hear \\"ominous, raspy panting,\\" feel \\"a ripping, a searing pain,\\" see \\"loathsome demons lurch[ing] forward,\\" and \\"detestable fiends...lips twisted by death in a ghastly grin.\\"<br />Characters don't just say their lines.  They pant, bray, screech, and whimper them.<br />\\"Great Lakes Lighthouse Tales of Terror\\" contains twenty-one imaginative tales, told in a very `in your face' style.<br />I would have preferred a subtler telling that left something to my own imagination.	2001-08-03

This collection from the Oxford University Press represents the oral tradition of fifteen peoples scattered across Northern Europe from Scandinavia, deep into Russia and beyond the Urals, and of the Hungarians in Central Europe.<br />There are extensive footnotes that illuminate the tradition and meaning of the entries, some of which are fragments of larger, lost works.  It is interesting to read a poem such as \\"To the Coffin-Makers,\\" and then turn to the commentary that explains Karelian burial traditions:<br />\\"...The need to use timber from trees in which birds had not rested or sung (cf. II. 9-10) reflects a belief in soul-birds.  It was essential to avoid upsetting the deceased---should he or she return in the form of a bird---by felling trees in which the soul might one day wish to rest.\\"<br />One of the more recondite marriage traditions among the Finnish, Karelian, and Estonian peoples involved teasing the prospective bride and bride-groom:  \\"The theme of seeking the best bride and finding the worst is a central feature....of the bride-teasing poems [that] were customarily sung by the groom's relatives at his home.\\"  Here are a few lines from \\"Teasing the Bride:\\"<br />\\"Listen, precious brother's son/ if you could but have taken an apple from higher boughs/ from the top of other trees!/...Attendants, you maid's brothers:/ take this away when you go/ the one you brought when you came!/ Don't take her along the road--/ take her over the big swamp!/  If you take her by the road/ even horses will stampede/  horseflies will take to their heels...\\"<br />The oral tradition of our ancestors was often somber.  It often attempted to explain our symbiosis with the natural and spiritual world.  However, it could also be joyous.

If anyone remotely connected to opera in the past three hundred years said or did anything clever, then he or she is lovingly quoted in \\"Opera Anecdotes.\\"<br />Sometimes, as in \\"The Famous Story of Handel's Cook,\\" the reader might have to strain to find the humor:<br />\\"How great a composer was Gluck?  Some say very great---\\"The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Opera\\" calls him `opera's second founder.'  Handel said not so great: `he knows no more uff counterpoint zan mein cook!'\\"<br />Handel's rollicking commentary is included in Mordden's anecdotal sketch of Christoph Willibald Gluck.<br />Even the author admits to the existence of operatic greats who are not remembered for their sparkling wit:<br />\\"One doesn't expect [Arnold] Schoenberg anecdotes---is this not the most austere character in music?---remote, complex, patriarchal, silently disapproving?  Schoenberg is like Moses, bringing a new code of behavior to his people---twelve-tone composition---and raging when they prove unworthy.\\"<br />Of course, Mordden does go on to tell Schoenberg's story in three pages worth of anecdotes, many of them grim---there really is nothing humorous about twelve-tone composition, or about being chased out of Germany by the Nazis (\\"Maus\\" comics notwithstanding.)<br />Usually this book looks at the lighter side of operatic life, and it includes my favorite story about Leo Slezak, who must have been one of the funniest tenors ever to grace the Wagnerian repertoire.  Here is the \\"Classic Leo Slezak Story:\\"<br />\\"Backstage at `Lohengrin' before his first entrance, Slezak was bemused to see the swan-boat take off just before he got into it:  a stagehand had jumped the cue.

Then work your way through the interviews in favorite categories of singers, rather than reading \\"Divo\\" front to back.  I started with Sam Ramey's interview, worked my way through the rest of the basses (Kurt Moll, Nicolai Ghiaurov, and Paata Burchuladze), the bass-baritones, the baritones, and so on up the `fach' through the tenors.<br />There are black-and-white photographs of all of the contributors, most of them publicity stills of the singer in his favorite role(s).  Helena Matheopoulos does a good job of combining each subject's biography and career highlights with his opinions on how a particular role should be sung, tips on the best way to practice, advice to singers who are still trying to make that big break into operatic stardom, and so forth.<br />\\"Divo\\" is not by any means a book of gossipy operatic anecdotes (although there are some light moments).

All in the name of fun---I mean, science.<br />This is one of the best, most exuberant books I've ever read on how an academic field biologist actually solves a scientific conundrum.  The only other book I can compare it with is Farley Mowat's &quot;Never Cry Wolf.&quot;  Mowat was dropped alone onto the frozen Canadian tundra, where he studied the ways of wolves.  Heinrich spent his winters in a tiny tarpaper shack in the Maine wilderness, galumphing through thigh-deep snow with a hundred pounds of cow entrails slung over his back, in order to study the ways of ravens.<br />Maine Ravens are almost exclusively carrion eaters, so in order to lure them to his observation posts the author had to feed them.  He also had to crawl out of his half-frozen sleeping bag (the tarpaper shack had no amenities such as central heating) at 5:30 in the morning in order to beat the ravens to their frozen breakfast, because they are such notoriously wary birds.  One false move or sound from him would send them winging away from his bait, sometimes never to return.<br />Heinrich makes all this sound like wonderful good fun.  He periodically lured his graduate students and friends up into the endless forest and through the blizzard to help him trap and band ravens.<br />I wish I had been one of his students.  Ever since I became acquainted with ravens during a canoe trip through the Northwest Territories, I've been curious about these elusive and complex corvids.  Heinrich's working diary more than satisfies that curiosity.  The text of this book was derived from his field notes, and he doesn't omit any of his observations, or any of his hypotheses whether they led to dead ends or not---that was part of the fun.<br />After reading &quot;Ravens in Winter,&quot; I wanted to go out and do my own field observations---except that I can't quite see myself crawling like Heinrich from privy to tarpaper shack in the midst of a snowstorm, so as not to disturb the ravens at their breakfast.<br />Now that crows have returned to Detroit (I never used to see them in the city when I was a kid), maybe ravens will be soon to follow.

It presents twelve true racetrack mysteries in chronological order beginning in 1932 with the death of Phar Lap, the great Australian Thoroughbred who won his first and only race in the United States before his mysterious demise.  The author interviewed the few remaining eyewitnesses to Phar Lap's spectacular American debut, including Noble Threewit who is still involved with horses at age ninety-two.  (I hope someone names a good horse after Noble Threewit---one of the most euphonious monikers in racing.  Hint to Thoroughbred breeders: Clyde Van Dusen was named after a trainer, and both trainer and gelding went on to win the 1929 Kentucky Derby).<br />Anyway, Phar Lap was put on display in a Melbourne museum, and John McEvoy has presented a very detailed and even-handed account of his death.  Did the &quot;Australian Man O'War&quot; die of arsenic poisoning?  Was the poisoning deliberate, or was he put out to graze on grass that had been sprayed with insecticide?  The author presents all of the remaining pieces of this fascinating puzzle.<br />There are other mysterious deaths in &quot;Great Horse Racing Mysteries&quot;: a trainer; jockeys; a racing commission official; William Woodward, the owner of Nashua, who was shot by his own wife; the decline and fall of Calumet Farm after the death of the stallion Alydar.<br />McEvoy, a former reporter for the &quot;Daily Racing Form&quot; also describes two Thoroughbred kidnappings, a racetrack arson, and two stories involving the possible drugging of Derby horses---one to help the horse win, and another to make the horse lose.<br />The latter story was a shocker for me, because the horse involved was Holy Bull, one of my favorite Thoroughbreds.  The eventual 1984 horse of the year, &quot;ran the worst race of his life in the Derby, a departure from form so startling and disturbing as to raise numerous questions in its aftermath.  His horrified owner-trainer [Jimmy Croll] subsequently became convinced this dismal effort resulted from the fleet gray colt's having been drugged prior to the Derby.&quot;<br />Once again, the author presents all of the evidence.  Even great Thoroughbreds throw in a clunker now and then.  But Holy Bull was not only fast, he was courageous.  As Tom Dawson of ESPN's 'Racing Across America' series said, &quot;It's so hard to get the horses with the talent and charisma...[Holy Bull] was the real thing.&quot;<br />If Holy Bull was drugged before the Derby---well, I'm glad to see him doing so well at stud.  His son, Macho Uno won the Breeder's Cup Juvenile and an Eclipse award last year, giving Holy Bull's true fans the hope that one of his get will win the Kentucky Derby in some future May, and wipe away the only spot of tarnish on their sire's racing record.<br />&quot;Great Horse Racing Mysteries&quot; should appeal to horse lovers and mystery fans alike.

Martin's six-volume epic, &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire.&quot;  His characters continue to be unlucky in love, and not all of the four kings who were still alive at the end of volume II, make it through volume III.<br />If I were a king in one of Martin's fantasies and someone suggested it was high time I married, I'd jump on my destrier and gallop like hell for the nearest monastery.  It would be safer to enlist in the Night Watch and fight animated corpses beyond the Wall of Ice than it would be to take a bride.<br />Speaking of which, the Night Watch and its enemies beyond the Wall come into much sharper focus in volume III.  Barbaric tribes of Wildlings begin to fight their way over the Wall, driven by the supernatural Others and their own living dead.  Most of the battle scenes take place at or near the Wall in &quot;A Storm of Swords,&quot; although the Queen across the Water, Daenerys Targaryen fights a few of her own while freeing slaves and raising her three dragons.<br />Martin doesn't spare his reader the gory details of medieval warfare or courtly love, which is why I don't think he should be compared to T. H. White (&quot;The Once and Future King&quot;).  Martin harkens back to the older, medieval legends of Arthur (e.g. Mallory's &quot;Morte d'Arthur&quot;) where the knights were a much bloodier, bawdier lot---not the types that Disney would want to immortalize.<br />T. H. White's advice on the battles and tournaments, &quot;Let's skip the parts where Sir Somebody smote somebody...,&quot; was definitely not taken to heart by Martin.  In his first three volumes, knights routinely whack off each other's collops, codpieces, and assorted body parts.  Four of the narrators in &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; are mutilated---a nose, a hand, and four finger joints go missing; the young boy-narrator, Brandon Stark was thrown from a window (in volume I) and paralyzed.<br />There are a couple of regicides, a patricide (or an attempted patricide), and a wife murder in volume III, plus other killings too numerous to mention.<br />The two Stark daughters, Princess Sanya (age 12) and Princess Arya (age 10) continue their narratives in  &quot;A Storm of Swords.&quot;  Sanya is bent on escaping from the Lannisters who rule in the name of Joffrey, the boy king.  Arya, who has already escaped is bent on avenging the death of her father.  Every night before she falls asleep, she recites the names of the people she wants to kill.  She is an innocent yet repellent little girl who bullies her friends and kills people in order to survive.  Her sister Sanya is much more passive.  She still believes that someday a noble prince will show up and ride off into the sunset with her.<br />However, she is now certain that her noble prince is not a Lannister.<br />Martin has created a harsh, yet dazzling world where even children have to kill or be killed.cides, a patricide (or an attempted patricide), and a wife murder in volume III, plus other killings too numerous to mention.<br />The two Stark daughters, Princess Sanya (age 12) and Princess Arya (age 10) continue their narratives in  &quot;A Storm of Swords.&quot;  Sanya is bent on escaping from the Lannisters who rule in the name of Joffrey, the boy king.

I didn't get a chance to visit the rest of her body (in the Roman church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva), but there was a mummified pope (one of the Innocents, I believe) in a glass case in the Vatican.  Rufus doesn't mention him in her book, probably because he wasn't a saint, so now I'm going to have to find out why he (of all the popes) wanted to be buried in plain sight.  An offbeat book like &quot;Magnificent Corpses&quot; often leads to detective work on subjects (deceased popes) that I never thought would interest me.<br />Rufus goes into interesting detail on both the living saint (if there is any historical evidence that the saint actually existed), and on the preservation and display of the saint's remains.  She scolds some of the saints and praises others, e.g. Catherine of Siena.  Some may be offended by the author's clever, ironic observations especially since Rufus is not herself a Catholic.  However, for me (also a non-Catholic) she turned a mummified finger and a head into the living woman who was credited with healing the schism between Rome and the Popes in Avignon.<br />One of my travelling companions borrowed &quot;Magnificent Corpses&quot; and was last seen reading it on our bus trip to Rome.  She seemed as fascinated as I was, so I think I'm going to have to buy myself another copy of Rufus's interesting work.	2001-07-20

However &quot;In Xanadu&quot; is an excellent book to take on vacation.  It is a lucid and sometimes hilarious account of a very low-budget journey through Asia ($1100 financed the entire trip through Israel, Cyprus, Turkey, Syria, Iran, Pakistan, and the breadth of China.)  And best of all, no matter how badly your own vacation turns out, you can always pick this book up and find Dalrymple in a more miserable spot than you are.<br />There is also beauty and moments of scholarly excitement when the author identifies some feature of the landscape with a passage from Marco Polo's journal.  I particularly liked his description of a nocturnal train trip through Turkey.  He sees dry flatlands transformed into lush pasturage and wonders at the source of water.  Then the train comes upon a river, and Dalrymple unfolds his map:<br />&quot;Its Turkish name, the Firat Nehri, meant nothing to me.  Only when I followed the thin blue line down through Syria and out towards Baghdad, did I see the river's more familiar name --- the Euphrates....Is there another river which carries with it so many associations?...The river which ran through the Garden of Eden, one of the five rivers of the Apocalypse!  Following its course on the map, its banks are littered with the names of the ancient cities it once gave life to:  Mari, Nippur, Uruk, Larsa, Erdu, Kish.&quot;<br />The above paragraph is a rare flight of fancy for Dalrymple.  His normal style is less flamboyant, laced with dry British humor where he tends to be the butt of his own jokes.  Sometimes the reader is left to discover the humor of the situation through one of his dialogues.  Here is Dalrymple in Kashgar, a Chinese city populated by the Muslim Uigurs.  He is trying to explain through an interpreter, the lifestyle of the British 'Chairman' Elizabeth II to an old mullah:<br />&quot;Salindi [the interpreter] frowned. 'He wants to know how many sheep, donkeys and camels your chairman owns.'<br />&quot;'Tell him she owns no camels, but has very many horses and a great number of corgi dogs.'<br />&quot;The information was passed on.  The old man nodded his head as he listened.<br />&quot;'Sir, this man is now asking about the dog which is called 'khor-qi'.  He asks whether these 'khor-qi' are good to eat.'<br />&quot;'Tell the old man that they are delicious.'&quot;<br />&quot;In Xanadu&quot; is travel writing in the grandly eccentric British tradition: a horrid climate and high adventure, laced throughout with dry wit.  Be sure to get a copy for your next vacation.  I'm going to loan mine to a friend who thinks she wants to visit Iran and Afghanistan (last year she trekked through Outer Mongolia).  Either &quot;In Xanadu&quot; will dissuade her from her planned adventure, or else she is as bonkers as Dalrymple..

However \\"A Clash of Kings\\" opens up many possible plot lines---there are five kings in Volume II as opposed to one king in Volume I,  and they spend this book warring against each other.  If you like to read about trebuchets that \\"turned living men into bone and pulp and gristle,\\" and you know the difference between a mace and a morning-star, then you'll probably enjoy the battle scenes more than I did.  Martin did his research on medieval weaponry and tactics, and his action scenes are totally riveting, even though ripped entrails, ichorous fluids, spastic colons, and roasting flesh are prominently featured.<br />I guess you can't scramble for thrones without breaking a few yokels.<br />Martin splits his narrative between ten different characters, eight of them continuing their stories from volume I:<br />· The Starks of Winterfell--- Lord Eddard of Winterfell's widow Catelyn, her daughters Sansa and Arya, her son Bran, plus Eddard's son, Jon. Catelyn's son Robb is crowned King of the North and spends much of volume II defeating the various armies fielded by Joffrey Baratheon's royal relatives.<br />· Daenerys Targaryen, daughter of the last Dragon-blood king and referred to as the 'Queen across the Water.'  She spends volume II raising her three young dragons and outwitting the various and colorful folks who covet a flying lizard of their very own.<br />· Tyrion Lannister, the current Queen's dwarf brother and chief councilor to the under-age king, Joffrey Baratheon.  Tyrion schemes with eunuchs, punishes traitors,defends his king, and dodges his sister-Queen's murderous henchmen.  He has all of the best lines in the book and I love him dearly even if he does lose part of his nose.<br />· Theon Grayjoy (new) - once a ward of the Starks, now a scheming turncoat.<br />· Davos the Onion Knight (new) - a former smuggler who is loyal to the 'King in the Narrow Sea,' Stannis Baratheon.  Davos and Tyrion Lannister are burdened with the main battle narratives, Davos from the sea and Tyrion from the besieged city.<br />Please don't try to read \\"A Clash of Kings\\" unless you've already finished \\"A Game of Thrones.\\"  You might be able to skip \\"A Clash of Kings\\" and go straight to volume III, although I wouldn't recommend doing so.  Although there is plenty of action, not much happens to move the whole series forward in volume II.  One of the five kings hooks up with a powerful fire sorceress, and in my humble opinion that is 'the' most important happening in \\"Clash\\".<br />However, we start to catch glimpses of the supernatural bones that support Martin's epic, e.g. the servants of the Drowned God, the followers of the Lord of Light, and evil sorcery beyond the Wall of ice.

Slim to none, I'd have guessed from previous treatments of my recommendations.<br />In this case though, both husband and friends were hooked from the first page.  The author begins with the tale of Boston Blackie, a cat who went berserk in the presence of other felines.  He ripped off their ears, he gouged out their eyes, he sent them streaking for the bushes even at feeding time.  And then, one day...but I don't want to spoil Blackie's story for you.  Just a hint - his name was changed to Basil and no anatomical alterations were involved.<br />Barbara Holland has written an extremely personal book about the history, lore, and personality of 'Felis libyca.'  In the chapter, &quot;A Choice of Cats&quot; she does riffs on many of the different feline breeds, but it is easy to see that the Siamese is her favorite:<br />&quot;Properly treated, Siamese develop a deep, single-hearted devotion to their people and overreact to competition, absences, and infidelity like an adolescent in love.  They need attention, and think nothing of pulling the books out of the bookcase and the pictures off the walls to get it.  They demand notice in a raucous, echoing voice that many people and some other cats find alarming; the sound has been compared to that of a giant sea gull in distress.  Taking on a Siamese is rather like getting married.&quot;<br />Our own preference is for Maine Coons (we share the house with five), and Barbara Holland tells a great story about them, too.  Not that I agreed with everything she wrote.  For instance, she stated that gray cats as a class are much friendlier than tabbies, which is exactly the opposite of our experience---and we've lived with two grays and about a million tabbies over the years.<br />Holland is also very upset by some of the artificially propagated breeds, such as the Cornish Rex and the Scottish Fold.  Her chapter on &quot;Show Business&quot; is sad, hilarious, and razor-sharp---sometimes all three in the same sentence.  Even if you think she is way off-base on her assessment of say, Himalayans or feline intelligence or declawing procedures,  you'll want to keep reading until the end of the book.  She is opinionated even to the point of irritation, but she is also extremely readable.<br />And Holland never confuses 'cat' with 'cute.'<br />There is one chapter in &quot;Secrets of the Cat&quot; (originally titled &quot;The Name of the Cat&quot;) that you might want to skip:  not because it is badly written, but because it is totally horrifying.

If you are new to this author, I suggest you start with one of his full-length mysteries to get the full flavor of his sometimes cranky, always brilliant amateur detective, Gervase Fen.<br />The best of the &quot;Fen Country&quot; stories feature Professor Fen with Chief Inspector Humbleby of New Scotland Yard as his Watson.  Some of the mysteries feature different, anonymous detectives and these stories tend to be clever puzzles with only the barest accouterments of character development or setting.<br />There is one semi-autobiographical, wish-fulfillment story, &quot;We Know You're Busy Writing, but We Thought You Wouldn't Mind if We Just Dropped in for a Minute.&quot;<br />&quot;I am forty-seven, unmarried, living alone, a minor crime-fiction writer earning, on average, rather less than 1,000 [pounds] a year.&quot;<br />The crime writer lives alone in Devon, and has begged his friends and creditors not to interrupt him during working hours.  Naturally they do, including a man and woman on the lam from their respective spouses.  There is no great mystery as to the fate of the lovers, only a great deal of authorly glee.<br />&quot;Fen Country&quot; is a good read for Crispin fans, but &quot;Beware of the Trains,&quot; whose stories he personally collected is better.  Neither short story collection transcends the genre of 'brilliant, eccentric detective' fiction like his novels do.  If you are an avid reader of  Allingham, Sayers, or Innes from the Golden Age of British mystery writing, try Crispin's &quot;Buried for Pleasure,&quot; &quot;The Long Divorce,&quot; or &quot;Love Lies Bleeding.&quot;  You might even be tempted to put Professor Fen at the top of your great detectives list, ahead of the likes of Lord Peter, Sir John Appleby, and Mr. Campion.	2001-06-24

However, if that was the original theme, it has been transformed into a generic (or perhaps I should say gnostic) battle of sublime Light versus demonic Darkness.<br />&quot;Hell on Earth&quot; is the type of professionally crafted fantasy that we've come to expect from Del Rey.  The reader is subjected to more cliff-hangers than Pauline in all of her perils, and Pauline's exclamations of horror and disgust have been thoroughly modernized.  The action never stops from the birth of a demon and the loss of a magical talisman, to the epilogue when a famous ball descends in Times Square.<br />Even though the author makes several biblical references, &quot;Hell on Earth&quot; is not at all preachy.  Humorous and inventive touches abound, including a demon that likes to masquerade as Humphrey Bogart.  The three major human characters are Colin the magician, Liz the author of a best-seller about a serial killer called 'The Maneater,' and Terry, ex-Army Ranger and current bodyguard.  They are all likeable, vulnerable, feisty, and willing to fight for the Right Side in the battle against evil.  Although all three are battling current dilemmas, the reader is also treated to lengthy flashbacks---so lengthy that I began to wonder if there was a prequel to &quot;Hell on Earth&quot; that I had somehow missed.  The book drops definite hints about a sequel:<br />&quot;He [Colin] had to find out. If there was even the faintest chance of Lilith [a character seen only in Colin's flashbacks] still being alive, he would do whatever it took to find out.  Even if it meant going back to the one place on Earth he had sworn never to set foot in again.&quot;<br />Michael Reeves has also written &quot;Darth Maul Shadow Hunter,&quot; which was spun off from a movie.  His &quot;Hell on Earth&quot; is a book that could head in the opposite direction and end up on film.  It's got snappy dialogue (especially between Zoel the angel and the Humphrey Bogart demon), strong visuals, likeable characters, lots of action, and a plot that easy to follow.  The flashbacks that slow down the book's momentum would probably be shortened, eliminated, or treated as part of the current action if &quot;Hell&quot; goes to the movies.<br />Suggestion:  if this book gives you an appetite for Babylonian demons, try Jonathan Aycliffe's &quot;The Talisman.&quot;  His demon, Shabbatil (Lord of the Flies) is totally horrific and has no sense of humor at all.t meant going back to the one place on Earth he had sworn never to set foot in again.&quot;<br />Michael Reeves has also written &quot;Darth Maul Shadow Hunter,&quot; which was spun off from a movie.

It is sandwiched between two collections of short stories: &quot;Beware of the Trains&quot; (1953) and &quot;Fen Country&quot; (1979- published posthumously.)<br />In this novel, Professor Fen is on sabbatical in the Devon countryside.  He is house-sitting for a couple of friends, writing a book that critiques the post-modern novel (this is funnier than it sounds), and pre-masticating pansy petals for his friends' finicky, gourmand tortoise.  Since this is another of Crispin's fine pastorals, there are also a variety of pigs (living and dead), cows, a sex-crazed tomcat, a narcoleptic horse, and a cocker spaniel that plays a minor role in the murder mystery.<br />In fact the mystery of who killed whom is almost buried under the goings-on of the livestock, the rural electric board, and the church fete.  Fen concerns himself not so much with the identity of the murderer, as he does with the identity of the person who kept sneaking into a tent at the rector's annual fete and cutting bits off of the concealed corpse.<br />One might even classify &quot;The Glimpses of the Moon&quot; as a 'locked tent' mystery.<br />Fen seems to have lost a great deal of energy since &quot;The Long Divorce,&quot; twenty-six years past.  He does not detect so much as get detected upon by his friends, the Rector, the Major, and the Horror-film Composer.  There are huge digressions that are interesting, but have nothing to do with the plot.  For instance, the bumblings of the South Western Electricity Board (Sweb) and the fox-hunt protesters get more page time than the murders.  There is also a great deal of satirical commentary on the &quot;over-developed sensibilities of under-developed nations&quot; by a foreign correspondent who is rusticating in Devon, after getting kicked out of yet another African country (some readers might find this offensive).<br />However, a Fen is a Fen and this is his last novel.  First-time readers might want to begin at the beginning of the series with &quot;The Case of the Gilded Fly.&quot;  My own favorite Fen is &quot;Love Lies Bleeding,&quot; followed very closely by &quot;The Long Divorce.&quot; &quot;The Moving Toyshop&quot; is the most-published of Crispin's mysteries, and probably the easiest to locate.  And don't neglect &quot;Frequent Hearses,&quot; which features a maze scene that is frighteningly reminiscent of M.R. James (in fact the woman who is lost in the maze quotes M.R. James at length---a very Crispian characteristic.)<br />Crispin's short stories featuring his remarkable detective-professor were originally published in a newspaper, to be read (and solved) on the train home from work.  They are fiendishly clever intellectual exercises but lack the depth of characterization and the sparkling, erudite conversation of his novels.offensive).<br />However, a Fen is a Fen and this is his last novel.

It involves foul play at the Castrevenford School for Boys, the second of Crispin's mysteries to take place outside of Fen's usual haunts in Oxford.<br />From 1943 to 1945 the author, Bruce Montgomery a.k.a. Edmund Crispin worked as an assistant master at Schrewsbury School, and he attributes his &quot;knowledge of the criminal in human nature&quot; to this experience.  I'm certain the fictional Castrevenford School and its inhabitants bear a close resemblance to Schrewsbury School and its inhabitants.  In fact, my Penguin edition of &quot;Love Lies Bleeding&quot; does not include the usual disclaimer  about 'work of fiction whose characters bear no resemblance, etc. etc...'<br />Hopefully, there weren't quite as many homicides at Schrewsbury.<br />One of my favorite characters in the Fen mysteries, the ancient and possibly senile Professor Wilkes, is missing from &quot;Love Lies Bleeding.&quot;   However at Castrevenford, Professor Wilkes has an eerie alter-ego in the ancient and possibly senile mixed Bloodhound, Mr. Merrythought.  In fact, the dog almost steals the stage from Fen:<br />&quot;'Good God,' said Fen in a muffled voice.<br />&quot;The dog was a large, forbidding bloodhound, on whose aboriginal color and shape one or two other breeds had been more or less successfully superimposed.  He stood just inside the doorway, unnervingly immobile, and fixed Fen with a malevolent and hypnotic stare....<br />&quot;'He ought to be put away, really,' said the headmaster, regarding Mr. Merrythought with considerable distaste.  'The trouble is, you see, that he's liable to homicidal fits.'<br />&quot;'Oh,' said Fen. 'Oh.'&quot;<br />Mr. Merrythought turns out to be a hero, not a murderer although there are plenty of those to go around.  Fen is invited to Castrevenford by his old friend the Headmaster, as a last-minute substitute to give out the prizes on Speech Day.  By the time Fen arrives, a student from the nearby Castrevenford Girls' High School has gone missing.  By the end of the day, two of the teachers at Castrevenford School for Boys are dead.<br />&quot;Love Lies Bleeding&quot; is less farcical than many of the Fen mysteries.  The school setting and its characters are marvelously depicted, without the exaggeration that Crispin sometimes used in his other books.  If it weren't for the murders, &quot;Love Lies Bleeding&quot; could be classified as a minor gem of an English pastoral.  It's my favorite Fen. <br />Of course, no Fen mystery is complete without a thicket of literary allusions.  If you are familiar with Wordsworth's poem, &quot;Love lies bleeding,&quot; then you may be able to guess the fate of the missing schoolgirl:<br />&quot;You call it, &quot;Love lies bleeding,&quot;--so you may,/   Though the red Flower, not prostrate, only droops,/  As we have seen it here from day to day,/  From month to month, life passing not away:/  A flower how rich in sadness!...&quot;  (William Wordsworth)	2001-06-07
1972933:US	53084107	RGDAKLJ1QTAEO	0827702515	546885374	Frequent Hearses: A Detective Story	Books	5	5	5	N	N	The best of the Golden Age of British mystery	If I had to rank my favorite British mystery authors who produced their best work in the 1930s through the 1950s, my list would look like this:<br />(1) Edmund Crispin a.k.a. Bruce Montgomery  (2) Michael Innes a.k.a. John Innes Mackintosh Stewart (3) Dorothy Sayers (4) Margery Allingham (5) Michael Innes a.k.a. John Innes Mackintosh Stewart (with a drop in rank for his mysteries that went off the surreal deep-end).<br />Out of my Fab Four Brits, Michael Innes and Edmund Crispin share the most similarities.  They were both of Scots-Irish background, both wrote their mysteries under pseudonyms while teaching at college, and both were educated at Oxford -- Oriel College and St. John's College, respectively.  They both wrote highly literate mysteries with frequent allusions to the classics (nine out of ten of which go zooming right over my head).  Michael Innes has his detective, Sir John Appleby poke fun at this high-brow type of murder fiction in &quot;Death at the Chase&quot;:<br />&quot;That's why detective stories are of no interest to policemen. Their villains remain far too consistently cerebral.&quot;<br />Expect that even the most vicious murderer in an Edmund Crispin mystery will quote Dryden or Shakespeare at the drop of a garrote.  &quot;Frequent Hearses&quot; is a fertile setting for this type of classical badinage, since its plot involves the making of a film based on the biography of Alexander Pope.  Gervase Fen, Oxford don of English Language and Literature, and amateur detective extraordinaire is hired by the film company as a story consultant, and he is plagued throughout the book by a Scotland Yard detective who is an amateur classics scholar.  Fen wants to discuss the murder.  Chief Inspector Humbleby wants to talk about the Brontes and Dr. Johnson.  Neither one will admit to a less than perfect understanding of either his profession or his hobby, and both despise amateurs.  Their encounters keep &quot;Frequent Hearses&quot; sparkling along right up until its final page.  Here is a sample of dialogue, wherein Inspector Humbleby deliberately misunderstands Fen's explanation of the film's subject:<br />&quot;Based,&quot; Fen reiterated irritably, &quot;on the life of Pope.&quot;<br />&quot;The Pope?&quot;<br />&quot;Pope.&quot;<br />&quot;Now which Pope would that be, I wonder?&quot; said Humbleby, with the air of one who tries to take an intelligent interest in what is going forward.  &quot;Pius, or Clement, or--&quot;<br />Fen stared at him.  &quot;Alexander, of course.&quot;<br />&quot;You mean&quot;---Humbleby spoke with something of an effort---&quot;you mean the Borgia?&quot;<br />All of Crispin's characters are carefully (one might say 'crisply') developed, and distinguished for the reader by a quirk or eccentric manner of speech (sometimes Crispin overplays the eccentricity at the expense of realism, especially with his main protagonist-- I do wish Fen would stop expostulating, &quot;Oh, my fur and whiskers!&quot;).  Physical description is sketchy.  If one of Crispin's characters walked past you in the street, you probably wouldn't recognize him.  However, if you were to overhear his conversation with the postman---<br />And I don't mean to imply that &quot;Frequent Hearses&quot; is all dialogue and no action.  There is one especially harrowing scene where a young woman chases the murderer into a maze in order to learn his identity and then (when reason returns) can't find her way back out again.  By the time Fen rescues her, she has endured an experience right out of an M.R. James horror story (in fact, the young woman quotes M.R.

Ellwood' in November, 1909.<br />My favorite story concerns the &quot; Alpena Storm&quot;  and the loss of the 'Trader.'  The author really did his research on the little steamer 'Trader,' which actually foundered a couple of days before the great storm of 1880.  Her eleven crewmen were rescued by the schooner 'Guide' and the 'Trader' itself was towed to Grand Haven.  Two days later, the &quot;Alpena Storm&quot; thundered down onto Lake Michigan and  &quot;full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew&quot; sank beneath its suddenly murderous waves---including the 'Trader,' which somehow broke away from her mooring in Grand Haven.  However at the time of her sinking she had no crew, even though the 'loss' of her eleven men was reported in all of the newspapers:<br />&quot;To Captain Brown [the 'Trader's master], the whole matter of the 'Trader' was probably an on-going source of aggravation for months to come.  He found himself having to explain to his peers, each time that they met, how it was that he had not perished on Lake Michigan.  Yet acquaintances that he had not seen in years greeted the good captain as if just returned from the great beyond.&quot;<br />The author has included photographs and drawings of many of the ships featured in his stories, and also maps of where some of them disappeared below the waves.<br />For the most part, Oleszewski stays away from the oft-told tales like the tragedy of the 'Eastland,' or the sinking of the 'Lady Elgin.'  When he does touch upon a well-known event, he focuses on one of the 'little guys'---an old barge, tugboat, or schooner on the Lake long past its retirement date---that got caught in the same storm as the big freighters.<br />According to its back cover, &quot;Ghost Ships, Gales &amp; Forgotten Tales&quot; casts new light on some of the obscure Lake events that &quot;have been under-reported, or forgotten altogether.&quot;f where some of them disappeared below the waves.<br />For the most part, Oleszewski stays away from the oft-told tales like the tragedy of the 'Eastland,' or the sinking of the 'Lady Elgin.'

Detective-Inspector Humbleby of New Scotland Yard usually plays the role of Watson to Fen's Holmes, and the reader is always given the clues needed to solve each of the sixteen mysteries before the final denouement.<br />My favorite story, &quot;The Golden Mean,&quot; is also an essay on evil. A son attempts to kill his father, and there is no mystery about what happened.  Fen's challenge is to prove that an attempt at murder occurred in the face of the father's denial:<br />&quot;A word like 'evil' needs (he will tell you) to be used with precaution: the descent of Avernus has no milestones which mark out for the traveller---or for others watching him---the stages of his journey.  And yet at the same time there is, perhaps, somewhere along it a Point of No Return.&quot;<br />The complete list of stories:  &quot;Beware of the Trains;&quot; &quot;Humbleby Agonistes;&quot; &quot;The Drowning of Edgar Foley;&quot; &quot;'Lacrimae Rerum';&quot; &quot;Within the Gates;&quot; &quot;Abhorred Shears;&quot; &quot;The Little Room;&quot; &quot;Express Delivery;&quot; &quot;A Pot of Paint;&quot; &quot;The Quick Brown Fox;&quot; &quot;Black for a Funeral;&quot; &quot;The Name on the Window;&quot; &quot;The Golden Mean;&quot; &quot;Otherwhere;&quot; &quot;The Evidence for the Crown;&quot; and &quot;Deadlock.&quot;<br />The last story, &quot;Deadlock&quot; is narrated by a young boy, and is longer and more atmospheric than its predecessors.

Yet in &quot;Swan Song,&quot; he gave us the bald, pub parrot that recited Heine in the original German.<br />In &quot;Love Lies Bleeding,&quot; Mr. Merrythought, the ancient, slovenly bloodhound thwarted a double murder.<br />&quot;The Long Divorce&quot; introduces Lavender, the cat who sees Martians.  (Either you have a cat who sees Martians---there is one perched on my printer right now, staring off into what humans refer to as 'empty space'---or else you will have to take Mr. Crispin's word that such perceptive cats exist.)  Lavender, the marmalade-colored tomcat with unusual visual powers is instrumental in the capture of a murderer.<br />Murder is really secondary to the story of a village plagued by an anonymous letter-writer.  Some of the letters are merely obscene.  Others are poisonously factual.<br />Gervase Fen, Professor of English Language and Literature in the University of Oxford is importuned by an old friend to expose the anonymous letter-writer.  And so Fen, microscopically disguised under the name of 'Mr. Datchery' (borrowed from Charles Dickens's &quot;The Mystery of Edmund Drood&quot;) takes himself off to his friend's bucolic village.<br />&quot;To an obbligato of bird-song Mr Datchery marched beneath a bright sky towards Cotton Abbas.  And he carolled lustily, to the distress of all animate nature, as he walked....The directions given him at Twelford had been explicit.  But since he believed himself to possess an infallible bump of locality, he was soon tempted to modify them with a variety of short cuts, and after about three miles he discovered, much to his indignation, that he was lost.&quot;<br />Is that or is that not Fen to the life?<br />&quot;The Long Divorce&quot; (1952) is eighth in Crispin's series of mysteries starring his literate, cynical, sometimes bumptious amateur detective.  It is also a comedy of rural, post-war England.  The characters are dead-on: the army veteran who is trying to stop smoking; the female physician who is struggling to build a practice in a conservative backwater;  the teenager who both loves and is ashamed of her obnoxious, money-grubbing father.<br />Many of the mystery writers of the 1940s and 1950s were guilty of creating one-dimensional female stereotypes, or going off on the occasional anti-feminist rant.  Margery Allingham, Rex Stout, and John Dickson Carr come readily to mind as producing examples of this type of writing.  Crispin also creates the occasional stereotype, especially in his early novels and some of his short stories, but the characters in &quot;The Long Divorce&quot; are fully and fascinatingly realized---especially the women (okay, okay---except for the innkeeper's wife and the sluttish barmaid.  But they are very minor players).<br />Crispin also works in an ongoing and thoughtful dialogue on suicide, and there is a hair-raising scene where Fen just manages to prevent a young girl from killing herself.<br />&quot;The Long Divorce&quot; is a classical Golden-Age British mystery, a thoughtful essay on suicide, and a marvelous, occasionally hilarious study of the rural English character.  I feel the same frustration that Fen felt, when at story's end he reveals his true name to a gathering of the book's characters---and very few of them have heard of him.<br />Why isn't Fen at least as well-known as Lord Peter or Miss Marple or Nero Wolfe?

Pierce's heroine, Aeriel is kidnapped by a darkangel to spin and weave for his twelve-and-one bride-wraiths, whose blood he has drained and whose souls he has imprisoned in his necklace.  He needs to find a fourteenth bride and go through a final blood-sucking, soul-stealing marriage ceremony before he can become a true vampyre.<br />Luckily, Aeriel doesn't strike him as bride-material:  &quot;'You?' he cried, and Aeriel's heart shrank, tightened like a knot beneath the bone of her breast.  'You be my bride?  By the Fair Witch, no.  You're much too ugly.&quot;<br />The darkangel himself is quite something to look at:<br />&quot;Then he opened his wings, and Aeriel found she could not move for wonder.  Before her stood the most beautiful youth ever she had seen.  His skin was pale and white as lightning, with a radiance that faintly lit the air.  His eyes were clear and colorless as ice.  His hair was long and silver, and about his throat he wore a chain:  on fourteen of the links hung little vials of lead.&quot;<br />To continue with the story, the beautiful darkangel flew forth from his castle to find a princess, and instead found Aeriel, the mud-bud (an appellation borrowed from Carol Burnett's retelling of &quot;The Princess and the Pea&quot;).<br />&quot;The Darkangel&quot; resembles &quot;The Princess and the Pea&quot; in that Aeriel is a sort of 'bride-in-disguise.'  The aspiring vampyre doesn't realize that he wants to marry her until after she has made friends with his previous thirteen wives, suborned his vicious gargoyles, escaped from his castle, and almost got him killed by a Lunar lion.<br />I can't give away any more of the plot, but I'd like to add that you need to be in the right frame-of-mind to truly appreciate the beauty of  &quot;The Darkangel&quot;---pensive, perhaps and willing to believe in the magical power of love.

Fen does run for office in one of Crispin's later books, but for reasons that have nothing to do with government, politics, or current events.<br />Incidentally, Sir John Appleby gets some air time in &quot;Holy Disorders,&quot; as the local constabulary keeps threatening to call in the big shot from New Scotland Yard when their murders are not promptly solved.  Fen manages to fend off Appleby as well as the Nazis.<br />Instead of a mere 'locked room' murder, &quot;Holy Disorders&quot; sports a pair of 'locked Cathedral' murders.  There is also a tinge of the supernatural---collapsing tomb stones, witchcraft, the shadow of a hanged man.  As one of the characters says about the first murder victim, &quot;What was it he saw, when he walked alone about the Cathedral?  What was it he found there, that no one else has found?&quot;<br />&quot;Holy Disorders&quot; may not be the most tightly constructed of the Fen mysteries, but there is a full cast of eccentric ecclesiastics, many of them inclined to witty, religious debate and obscure literary allusions.  In one of my favorite scenes in the book, Fen and his companion interview one of the murder suspects, a minor church canon, who is unfamiliar with the poetry of Edgar Allan Poe.  The interview takes place in the suspect's study which is furnished with, &quot;a pallid bust of Pallas-or more probably of some dead ecclesiastic, since both sex and features were indistinguishable in the crepuscular light---in a niche above the door.  And there, great heavens---Geoffrey felt the sense of unreality which one has immediately on waking from a vivid dream---was a raven.  It perambulated the desk with that peculiar gracelessness which walking birds have, ruffled its feathers, and stared malignantly at the intruders.&quot;<br />The minor canon also has a wife named Lenore.  Once Fen and his friend, Geoffrey learn about Lenore, they are off and quoting:<br />&quot;On its perch, the raven ruffled its feathers again.  The branch of a tree growing outside of the window scraped against the panes.  Fen succumbed suddenly to the obsessing temptation.<br />'Surely,' he said---surely that is someone at your window lattice?'&quot;<br />The interview deteriorates into a morass of mangled Poe (a fen of finagled Poe?).  Even without the evil Nazis and spooky witchcraft, this interview alone is worth the price of &quot;Holy Disorders.&quot;<br />Especially if you were forced (as I was) to memorize &quot;The Raven&quot; at some point in your misspent youth.scenes in the book, Fen and his companion interview one of the murder suspects, a minor church canon, who is unfamiliar with the poetry of Edgar Allan Poe.

It involves foul play at the Castrevenford School for Boys, the second of Crispin's mysteries to take place outside of Fen's usual haunts in Oxford.<br />From 1943 to 1945 the author, Bruce Montgomery a.k.a. Edmund Crispin worked as an assistant master at Schrewsbury School, and he attributes his &quot;knowledge of the criminal in human nature&quot; to this experience.  I'm certain the fictional Castrevenford School and its inhabitants bear a close resemblance to Schrewsbury School and its inhabitants.  In fact, my Penguin edition of &quot;Love Lies Bleeding&quot; does not include the usual disclaimer  about 'work of fiction whose characters bear no resemblance, etc. etc...'<br />Hopefully, there weren't quite as many homicides at Schrewsbury.<br />One of my favorite characters in the Fen mysteries, the ancient and possibly senile Professor Wilkes, is missing from &quot;Love Lies Bleeding.&quot;  However at Castrevenford, Professor Wilkes has an eerie alter-ego in the ancient and possibly senile mixed Bloodhound, Mr. Merrythought.  In fact, the dog almost steals the stage from Fen:<br />&quot;'Good God,' said Fen in a muffled voice.<br />&quot;The dog was a large, forbidding bloodhound, on whose aboriginal color and shape one or two other breeds had been more or less successfully superimposed.  He stood just inside the doorway, unnervingly immobile, and fixed Fen with a malevolent and hypnotic stare....<br />&quot;'He ought to be put away, really,' said the headmaster, regarding Mr. Merrythought with considerable distaste.  'The trouble is, you see, that he's liable to homicidal fits.'<br />&quot;'Oh,' said Fen. 'Oh.'&quot;<br />Mr. Merrythought turns out to be a hero, not a murderer although there are plenty of those to go around.  Fen is invited to Castrevenford by his old friend the Headmaster, as a last-minute substitute to give out the prizes on Speech Day.  By the time Fen arrives, a student from the nearby Castrevenford Girls' High School has gone missing.  By the end of the day, two of the teachers at Castrevenford School for Boys are dead.<br />&quot;Love Lies Bleeding&quot; is less farcical than many of the Fen mysteries.  The school setting and its characters are marvelously depicted, without the exaggeration that Crispin sometimes used in his other books.  If it weren't for the murders, &quot;Love Lies Bleeding&quot; could be classified as a minor gem of an English pastoral.  It's my favorite Fen.<br />Of course, no Fen mystery is complete without a thicket of literary allusions.  If you are familiar with Wordsworth's poem, &quot;Love lies bleeding,&quot; then you may be able to guess the fate of the missing schoolgirl:<br />&quot;You call it, 'Love lies bleeding,'--so you may,/  Though the red Flower, not prostrate, only droops,/  As we have seen it here from day to day,/  From month to month, life passing not away:/  A flower how rich in sadness!...&quot;  (William Wordsworth)r, as a last-minute substitute to give out the prizes on Speech Day.

John Innes Mackintosh Stewart wrote the introduction to &quot;Swan Song,&quot; wherein he claims that Crispin solved the dilemma  of the 'Great Detective versus the bumbling police' scenario that many Golden Age mystery authors had to contend with.  The dilemma in a nutshell: why would a twentieth-century policeman, who was much more adept and scientifically trained than his counterpart in the late Victorian era of Sherlock and Mycroft, call in an amateur (no matter how intelligent) to help him with his inquiries?<br />According to Innes, &quot;The Great Detective was, curiously, often a person of title, like Dorothy Sayers's Lord Peter Wimsey, or at least the familiar of persons of title.  It is never easy to render plausible the acceptance of a meddlesome private investigator by a group of professional policemen standing round a corpse, and novelists appear to have felt that a lord will be better received...&quot;<br />Innes himself wrote a series of mysteries starring the titled Sir John Appleby.<br />Crispin avoided the 'blue-blooded detective' solution.  His detective, Gervase Fen is part of the same social milieu as the police.  He is a professor of English literature at Oxford, but his cherished hobby is criminal investigation.  His detective counterpart (Sir Richard Freeman in &quot;Swan Song&quot;) has a passion for literary scholarship. Their dialogues (mainly disagreements) keep &quot;Swan Song&quot; swimming right along.  It's definitely not a 'Great Detective versus bumbling policeman' relationship---it's more like two crotchety friends with mutual interests who keep running into each other in various Oxford pubs and murder scenes.<br />&quot;Swan Song&quot; starts out rather unpromisingly:<br />&quot;There are few creatures more stupid than the average singer.  It would appear that the fractional adjustment of larynx, glottis and sinuses required in the production of beautiful sounds must almost invariably be accompanied---so perverse are the habits of Providence---by the witlessness of a barnyard fowl.&quot;<br />I would have thought that the above statement applied to tenors and sopranos only (singing in such a high register seems to destroy their brain cells), but it is the bass in &quot;Swan Song&quot; who sets himself up for murder.  Several members of  &quot;Die Meistersinger von N&uuml;rnberg&quot; cast have good reasons for wishing Edwin Shorthouse dead, in spite of his voice and its drawing power.<br />Even his composer-brother has a motive for killing the bass, and after a meeting with him, Fen is also made to question the intelligence of composers:  &quot;As a general rule, composers aren't the brightest of mortals, except where music's concerned.&quot;<br />Since Crispin himself composed music, it might be better if the reader did not take his commentary on the intelligence of musicians too seriously!<br />One of my favorite characters from &quot;The Moving Toyshop&quot; shows up in &quot;Swan Song&quot;-the deaf and (according to Fen) senile Professor Wilkes who makes a habit of stealing Fen's whisky.  He and Fen are always good for a round or two of acrimonious repartee whenever they meet.<br />A third dialogue element that threads merrily through the book is a crime writer's attempt to interview Fen about his most famous cases.  Every time Fen clears his throat and begins, &quot;The era of my greatest successes...&quot;  someone is bound to interrupt him.<br />We never do get to learn what Fen considers his greatest successes, but surely the outcome of &quot;Swan Song&quot; must be counted among them.<br />NOTE:  &quot;Swan Song&quot; was also published under the title &quot;Dead and Dumb.&quot;ly be accompanied---so perverse are the habits of Providence---by the witlessness of a barnyard fowl.&quot;<br />I would have thought that the above statement applied to tenors and sopranos only (singing in such a high register seems to destroy their brain cells), but it is the bass in &quot;Swan Song&quot; who sets himself up for murder.

Gardeners in different zones will have to adjust accordingly.<br />There are over 400 color photographs, focused primarily on a particular species, rather than how that species appears in a landscape.  In fact, if I were allowed to make a suggestion for the next edition of  &quot;Gardening with Perennials Month by Month&quot; it would be to include information on which plants look and do well when grouped in close proximity.<br />Suggestion for other gardeners: use &quot;The Well-Tended Perennial Garden&quot; by  Tracy Disabato-Aust in conjunction with &quot;Gardening with Perennials Month by Month.&quot; Disabato-Aust is more informative about the impact of a particular perennial in the landscape as a whole.  She also includes useful information on how to extend the blooming season (mainly by pruning).	2001-05-29

Then she, too, vanished without a trace down on the Mississippi River.&quot;<br />It's easy to understand how ships go missing in the Great Lakes or on the Seven Seas.  But how do they manage to disappear without a trace on a river, even one the size of the Mississippi?  In his chapter &quot;Without a Trace,&quot; the author attributes the disappearance of ships to pirates, waterspouts (he was actually on board a ship that sailed through a water spout), UFOs, and the Bermuda Triangle.<br />Incidentally, Richard Winer is also the author of &quot;The Devil's Triangle.&quot;<br />In addition to ships that vanished without a trace, there are also ships that stayed afloat (and in one case delivered the mail) but lost their crews.  The 'Mary Celeste' of nineteenth-century fame is mentioned,  but Winer spends most of his time with the 'Joyita,' a sixty-five foot yacht that mislaid her crew of twenty-five right in the middle of the twentieth century.  She was found deserted and adrift ninety miles north of Fiji, her radio smashed, and part of her cargo missing.<br />Rather than accept the more mundane explanation of piracy on the high seas, the author elaborates on the theory that the 'Joyita' was jinxed.  She was cursed by the widow of a Portuguese shipfitter who died while the yacht was still under construction, and the disappearance of her crew was only one of several incidents that solidified 'Joyita's reputation as a bad-luck ship.<br />Whether or not you choose to believe, with the author, that the 'Joyita' was trailed all over the South Pacific by a ghostly Portuguese galleon---well, &quot;No Joy aboard the Joyita&quot; is not the strangest chapter in this book.<br />Oddly enough, there aren't too many ghosts aboard &quot;Ghost Ships.&quot;  A chapter is devoted to the ghosts on the luxury liner, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; (now a museum).  The ghost of Errol Flynn, and the headless ghost of the pirate Bartholemy Portuguese make brief appearances.  There are a pair of swimming ghosts that followed their former ship, the &quot;Watertown,&quot; long after their burial at sea.<br />One frightening story involves a Russian ship, the 'Ivan Vassili,' that seemed to be possessed by something other than a ghost.  At irregular intervals, 'it' caused the 'Vassili's crew to go berserk:<br />&quot;For twenty minutes, the men ran amuck, screaming wildly, racing about the ship, totally oblivious to what they were doing.  They were beating each other and themselves.  During the frenzied melee a seaman named Alex Govinski, broke away from the others, hurled himself over the rail into the blackness of the sea and disappeared.  Then, in a matter of seconds, it was all over.  Everything, including the possessed seamen, returned to normal.  Except for the loss of Govinski, it was as if nothing had happened.&quot;<br />After a few more suicides and incidents of mass hysteria, the crew finally deserted the 'Ivan Vassili' in the port of Vladivostok and burned her to the waterline.<br />&quot;Ghost Ships&quot; is a fun, scary read if you ignore the occasional misspelling, unfamiliar grammatical construction, and some of the author's more outr&egrave; theories on the mysteries of sea.hor, that the 'Joyita' was trailed all over the South Pacific by a ghostly Portuguese galleon---well, &quot;No Joy aboard the Joyita&quot; is not the strangest chapter in this book.    <br />Oddly enough, there aren't too many ghosts aboard &quot;Ghost Ships.&quot;   A chapter is devoted to the ghosts on the luxury liner, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; (now a museum).

For instance, the Emperor Maximilian Diamond was worn by its owner when he was executed by firing squad in Mexico.  This 41.94 carat gem, which possesses a very strong blue fluorescence, was returned to his widow Carlotta, who &quot;as the result of these events, was to remain mentally deranged until her death near Brussels in 1927.  The gem was sold in order to help pay her medical expenses.&quot;<br />The Hope Diamond which is well-known for its dark sapphire-blue coloring, has acquired a reputation for bringing bad luck to its owner.  It was stolen, along with many of the French Crown Jewels during the Revolution and made its way to England.  Eventually it was bought by a Russian Prince named Ivan Kanitowsky who either gave or loaned the Hope to &quot;a Folies Berg&egrave;res actress who was shot across the footlights next day by her lover or by the prince as she wore the stone; the Prince was later stabbed to death by [Russian] revolutionaries...&quot;<br />The Mirror of Portugal, once part of the Crown Jewels of Portugal was stolen by the same French thieves who absconded with the Hope diamond.  Unfortunately, it was never recovered.<br />Connoisseurs of rare fancy-colored diamonds can learn the history of the Dresden Green, the Hope (which glows like a red-hot coal after exposure to ultra-violet light), the champagne-colored 890 carat Incomparable, and the pink Hortensia, which was also stolen during the French Revolution---  &quot;As he was on the point of being executed, a man named Depeyron disclosed that he had hidden [the Hortensia] in a bag containing gold and other diamonds, including the Regent, in a garret.&quot;<br />The author doesn't say whether Depeyron's confession obtained him a reprieve from Madame Guillotine.<br />Ian Balfour tracked down the histories of these famous diamonds as he worked in various capacities in the diamond industry for almost 30 years, most recently as a consultant to a firm of diamond brokers. (He is also the composer of seven operas!)  In this book, he attempts to give, &quot;as straightforward and accurate an account as possible of the world's greatest diamonds.&quot;  He debunks some of the legends that have become attached to the most famous stones, e.g. the Idol's Eye, the Eureka, and the Great Mogul.  However, there is still enough intrigue and skulduggery attached to the diamonds' verifiable histories to satisfy  even the most romantically inclined reader.<br />No photograph can capture the true beauty and fire of the 'king of gems,' but the photographs, many in color, in this coffee-table-sized book are an interesting supplement to the text.  Some show the various owners (maharajahs, empresses, Folies Berg&egrave;res actresses, Ziegfield Follies Girls, Elizabeth Taylor) in proud possession of their costly and fascinating gems.the histories of these famous diamonds as he worked in various capacities in the diamond industry for almost 30 years, most recently as a consultant to a firm of diamond brokers.

1991657:US	53084107	R16K125HI2CXAQ	0708963617	863618408	Swan Song (LIN) (Linford Mystery)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Fourth in mystery series starring Gervase Fen, Oxford don	The British mystery author, Michael Innes a.k.a. John Innes Mackintosh Stewart wrote the introduction to &quot;Swan Song,&quot; wherein he claims that Crispin solved the dilemma  of the 'Great Detective versus the bumbling police' scenario that many Golden Age mystery authors had to contend with.  The dilemma in a nutshell: why would a twentieth-century policeman, who was much more adept and scientifically trained than his counterpart in the late Victorian era of Sherlock and Mycroft, call in an amateur (no matter how intelligent) to help him with his inquiries?<br />According to Innes, &quot;The Great Detective was, curiously, often a person of title, like Dorothy Sayers's Lord Peter Wimsey, or at least the familiar of persons of title.  It is never easy to render plausible the acceptance of a meddlesome private investigator by a group of professional policemen standing round a corpse, and novelists appear to have felt that a lord will be better received...&quot;<br />Innes himself wrote a series of mysteries starring the titled Sir John Appleby.<br />Crispin avoided the 'blue-blooded detective' solution.  His detective, Gervase Fen is part of the same social milieu as the police.  He is a professor of English literature at Oxford, but his cherished hobby is criminal investigation.  His detective counterpart (Sir Richard Freeman in &quot;Swan Song&quot;) has a passion for literary scholarship. Their dialogues (mainly disagreements) keep &quot;Swan Song&quot; swimming right along.  It's definitely not a 'Great Detective versus bumbling policeman' relationship---it's more like two crotchety friends with mutual interests who keep running into each other in various Oxford pubs and murder scenes.<br />&quot;Swan Song&quot; starts out rather unpromisingly:<br />&quot;There are few creatures more stupid than the average singer.  It would appear that the fractional adjustment of larynx, glottis and sinuses required in the production of beautiful sounds must almost invariably be accompanied---so perverse are the habits of Providence---by the witlessness of a barnyard fowl.&quot;<br />I would have thought that the above statement applied to tenors and sopranos only (singing in such a high register seems to destroy their brain cells), but it is the bass in &quot;Swan Song&quot; who sets himself up for murder.  Several members of  &quot;Die Meistersinger von N&uuml;rnberg&quot; cast have good reasons for wishing Edwin Shorthouse dead, in spite of his voice and its drawing power.<br />Even his composer-brother has a motive for killing the bass, and after a meeting with him, Fen is also made to question the intelligence of composers:  &quot;As a general rule, composers aren't the brightest of mortals, except where music's concerned.&quot;<br />Since Crispin himself composed music, it might be better if the reader did not take his commentary on the intelligence of musicians too seriously!<br />One of my favorite characters from &quot;The Moving Toyshop&quot; shows up in &quot;Swan Song&quot;-the deaf and (according to Fen) senile Professor Wilkes who makes a habit of stealing Fen's whisky.  He and Fen are always good for a round or two of acrimonious repartee whenever they meet.<br />A third dialogue element that threads merrily through the book is a crime writer's attempt to interview Fen about his most famous cases.  Every time Fen clears his throat and begins, &quot;The era of my greatest successes...&quot;  someone is bound to interrupt him.<br />We never do get to learn what Fen considers his greatest successes, but surely the outcome of &quot;Swan Song&quot; must be counted among them.<br />NOTE:  &quot;Swan Song&quot; was also published under the title &quot;Dead and Dumb.&quot;ly be accompanied---so perverse are the habits of Providence---by the witlessness of a barnyard fowl.&quot;<br />I would have thought that the above statement applied to tenors and sopranos only (singing in such a high register seems to destroy their brain cells), but it is the bass in &quot;Swan Song&quot; who sets himself up for murder.

The violent death of King Ananda of Siam was one of his most famous cases.  At the opposite end of the notoriety scale was an incident involving the murder of a Shoreditch girl whose sister flung a bread knife at her.  As a pathologist, Simpson saw it all and wrote about it in clear, robust prose that does not spare his reader the gruesome details.<br />The introductory chapter to &quot;Forty Years of Murder&quot; is &quot;Why choose Pathology?&quot;<br />&quot;You might well ask what could possibly persuade any young doctor, unmarried and without ties, to take up the study of the dead - the diseased, mutilated, sometimes even dismembered dead, whose bodies seem to come to light at such odd hours and in such queer places.&quot;<br />Professor Simpson goes on to answer his own question with a great deal of relish, even quoting John Wesley:  &quot;Ah, lovely appearance of Death, /What sight upon earth is so fair? /Not all the gay pageants that breathe /Can with a dead body compare.&quot;<br />If you could imagine the autobiography of Sherlock Holmes as ghost-written by Rabelais, you will acquire a good notion of Professor Simpson's style.  However, the best way to get an impression of the man and his methods is to read &quot;Forty Years of Murder.&quot;  (Skip the black-and-white photographs---and the cover for that matter, if you are squeamish.)  Simpson concentrates on several interesting cases, but also gives his reader a fascinating overview of homicide investigations as practiced in Great Britain (with a few side trips to Thailand, Portugal, Canada, and the Caribbean) from the late 1920s through the 1960s.<br />In Chapter 19, &quot;The Innocence of Dr. Bodkin Adams&quot; there is an eerie foreshadowing of  the recent case of Dr. Harold Shipman, the most prolific serial killer in British criminal history.  Just this week, the Greater Manchester doctor was sentenced to life in prison for murdering fifteen of his middle aged and elderly women patients by lethal injection.  The police believe he may have killed as many as 150 patients during his thirty-year career.<br />Dr. Bodkin Adams in &quot;Forty Years of Murder&quot; proved to be innocent of killing his elderly patients, but read what Simpson has to say about physicians:<br />&quot;Doctors are in a particularly good position to commit murder and escape detection.  Their patients, sometimes their own fading wives, more often mere ageing nuisances, are in their sole hands. 'Dangerous drugs' and powerful poisons lie in their professional bags or in the surgery.  No one is watching or questioning them, and a change in symptoms, a sudden 'grave turn for the worse' or even death is for them alone to interpret.&quot;<br />One wonders whether the murderous Dr. Shipman would have escaped detection as long as he did, if Professor Simpson had still been the British Home Office Pathologist.ter Manchester doctor was sentenced to life in prison for murdering fifteen of his middle aged and elderly women patients by lethal injection.

The &quot;Gemstones&quot; handbook claims to be a &quot;visual guide to more than 130 gemstone varieties,&quot; and has over 800 true-color photographs of everything from achroite (tourmaline) to zoisite (Tanzanite), with all of the more familiar gemstones such as aquamarines and rubies in between.<br />This book reminds me of a gemology course I took while in college.  The instructor used to pass around trays of gemstones so that we could observe and handle examples of what we were studying.  (He always counted the stones when the tray came back to him, which was the only thing that kept me honest.)  &quot;Gemstones&quot; set my mouth to watering just like those trays of yesteryear.  The text accompanying the photographs is also rigorous enough to be used for an introductory course in gemology.  It is organized to accompany the photographs, and there are also special sections on the physical properties of gemstones, where they are found, their history and folklore, and a very lovely color key to the gems.<br />The author, Cally Hall is a fellow of the Gemmological Association and Gem Testing Laboratory of Great Britain, and is a member of the curatorial team at the Natural History Museum in London.  She specializes in the study of colored gemstones, so I think this book must have been a labor of love.

In spite of his discontinuous narrative, Martin has done a masterful job of orchestrating his characters' fates.  He sweeps his readers up into the lives (one chapter at a time, anyway) of the deposed heirs of the Old Dragon-blood Dynasty, the usurping kings of House Baratheon, and the Northern King-makers of the House Stark.<br />Six Starks dominate the narrative: Lord Eddard of Winterfell, his wife Catelyn, and three of their legitimate children, plus Eddard's bastard son, Jon.<br />Another narrator is Daenerys, daughter of the last Dragon-blood king.  Daenerys manages to escape the destruction of her family, only to be sold into marriage with a character who could pass for Attila the Hun.  She has the most surprising tale to tell, and she is also the character who has to do the most growing and changing in &quot;A Game of Thrones.&quot;  If this were her story alone, Daenerys would be very easy to love, even though she has been given the book's tritest lines:<br /> &quot;My lord,&quot; she said softly.  &quot;Drogo.  My sun-and-stars,&quot; or &quot;I am no child, she told him fiercely.&quot;<br />The final story-teller of the game of thrones is my favorite: Tyrion Lannister, the current Queen's dwarf brother (that's 'dwarf' as in 'short human', not 'dwarf' as in cute, hairy Vernor's gnome).  Tyrion's warrior-brother and sister-Queen are beautiful, golden-haired twins who must have been hell to grow up with, because his verbal sallies and counter-punches are easily the sharpest dialogue in the book.  I always looked forward to reading Tyrion's chapters, and I bet the author enjoyed writing them too.<br />Tyrion is also the book's most complex character.  The adult Starks are very honorable, duty-driven types---easy to admire but a little hard to like.  The numerous child-narrators are likeable, but a bit unformed.  However Tyrion comes across to the reader as a full-grown human being: witty; dangerous; loving; full of life and curiosity about life; and even a little honorable.  I hope Martin features him prominently through all of his sequels.<br />Another major character in &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; has no narrative duties.  It is the gigantic wall of ice that has guarded humanity since the last great winter, eight millennia past.  Unfortunately, it was built so long ago that most people have forgotten what it is protecting them from.  The Black Brotherhood stands guard at the Wall, but it has fallen onto hard times.  Its only recruits are felons and knights under threat of dire punishment.<br />The Brotherhood's rangers start to disappear north of the Wall.<br />Winter is coming.<br />Let &quot;The Game of Thrones&quot; begin!sallies and counter-punches are easily the sharpest dialogue in the book.

There are even photographs of cats with no coat at all (Sphynx).<br />I own three of the Eyewitness Handbooks (&quot;Cats&quot;, &quot;Horses&quot;, &quot;Gems&quot;) and they are a browser's delight.  The &quot;Cats&quot; handbook purports to be a &quot;visual guide to more than 250 types of cats from around the world,&quot; and if you count all of the different color variations of say, Persians, as a different type, this is undoubtedly true.  Two small, fact-filled paragraphs labeled 'Features' and 'Remarks' accompany each of the 'types' (most of which are recognized cat breeds), along with a short history of that particular feline variation.<br />The text and photographs are slanted toward British standards, although the differences are minor for most breeds.  If you happen to be a Persian fancier or have attended any North American cat shows, then you'll probably notice from this book's photographs that the British Persians have more sensible noses than their American counterparts.  There are also differences on acceptable breed colors and markings, depending on which side of the Atlantic you happen to live.<br />&quot;Cats&quot; is easy to use and fun to browse. I had no idea that cats came in so many different colors:  cream point; red silver mackerel tabby; platinum; mink; sable; chocolate smoke; sepia agouti; cinnamon tortie---Eye-candy for all cat lovers!	2001-05-15

I think it merits a place on the bestseller list next to &quot;In the Heart of the Sea : The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex&quot;  by Nathaniel Philbrick, or &quot;The Perfect Storm: A True Story of Men Against the Sea&quot; by Sebastian Junger.<br />William Ratigan, a journalist whose father was a steamboat engineer, has written a romantic, blood-curdling maritime history of the Great Lakes, starting with Champlain's canoe as it ventured out onto Lake Huron, and ending with the thousand-foot bulk freighters that now churn our waters.<br />In his introduction, Ratigan warns the reader that even the biggest freighter is not guaranteed a safe return to port:<br />&quot;These great ships sail Great Lakes that can swallow them in one black moment without a trace.  Storms exploding across hundreds of miles of open water pile up mountainous seas that strike swifter, and more often, than the deadliest waves on any ocean.  Before the ship has a chance to recover from the last blow, the next is upon her.  The Lakes captain has no sea room in which to maneuver; unlike his salt-water counterpart he must stay on course throughout the storm; he must weather the teeth of the gale.&quot;<br />Each Lake's storms, shipwrecks, fires, and rescues gets its own section within &quot;Great Lakes Shipwrecks &amp; Survivals.&quot;  The last section of the book's third edition (which I own) is devoted to the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald, the introduction of  bulk freighters into the Lakes, and the extension of the shipping season.<br />I'm glad this book was reissued in 2000, as I will soon need a replacement copy.  I reread it almost every November, when gray skies close down over the freighters that still steam up and down the Detroit River near our house.<br />Are there captains out there, like the captains of the ill-fated Howard M. Hanna, Jr., the Daniel J. Morrell, the Carl D. Bradley, and the Edmund Fitzgerald, who are trying to squeeze in 'one last run' of the season?<br />As Ratigan says of these captains, &quot;...they often stay out on the Lake beyond the time of regular insurance, beyond the time of navigational prudence.  Once in a while, striving to make one last trip before winter locks up the Lakes, they make one last trip indeed---the last trip forever.&quot;f the ill-fated Howard M. Hanna, Jr., the Daniel J.

Its editors, who are both scholars of occult literature, collected the best of the best from the Golden Age of ghost story writing.  If you are already a reader of the phantasmagoric, some of the anthology will be familiar, e.g. &quot;An Account of Some Strange Disturbances in Aungier Street,&quot; &quot;The Romance of Certain Old Clothes,&quot; or &quot;John Charrington's Wedding.&quot;<br />There are also lesser-known tales of vengeful ghosts, haunted houses, and &quot;things in a dead man's eye,&quot; the latter courtesy of Rudyard Kipling's &quot;At the End of the Passage.&quot;<br />According to the editors' introduction, one of their aims for this anthology was to &quot;map out the development of the Victorian ghost story from circa 1850...it is in the 1850s that the distinct, anti-Gothic character of the Victorian ghost story begins to emerge.&quot; Which is not to say that the Gothic emphasis on moldering sepulchres is altogether missing.  Try &quot;The Tomb of Sarah&quot; by F. G. Loring, whose story begins with the memorial inscription:<br />&quot;SARAH.  1630. FOR THE SAKE OF THE DEAD AND THE WELFARE OF THE LIVING, LET THIS SEPULCHRE REMAIN UNTOUCHED AND ITS OCCUPANT UNDISTURBED TILL THE COMING OF CHRIST.&quot;<br />Of course, the story's protagonist believes he has an excellent reason for disturbing the dead.

Overall, the anthology is genuinely creepy although a couple entries seemed overly precious---'Twee' is the British term that I think I'd use to describe &quot;A Scent of Mimosa&quot; by Francis King and &quot;The Harpsichord&quot; by Elizabeth LeFanu.  Other reviewers found these stories to be wonderfully subtle and atmospheric, while my own favorites, &quot;Dengue Fever&quot; by Paul Theroux and &quot;The Sword of Frey&quot; by Brian R. Hall were anything but subtle.  The former involves bicycling ghosts with &quot;no teeth, and their gums are dripping with blood,&quot; while the latter features a cellar full of skeletons and a cursed sword.<br />The first prize winner, &quot;The Doll Named Silvio&quot; by Michael Kernan has no traditional ghost, but concerns itself with a girl and her unnatural dolls--or should I say an unnatural girl and her dolls?  Ugh.  'Silvio' is horrible in the sense that it is a must-read for fans of the abnormal psyche.  The ending is a shocker.<br />Another doll story, &quot;Marius the Doll,&quot; by F. Terry Newman features a doll that is a much-too-realistic imitation of its owner.<br />&quot;The Times Anthology of Ghost Stories&quot; contains something for everyone who appreciates a good scare.  I hope &quot;The Times&quot; may soon be inspired to announce another competition for &quot;best original, previously unpublished ghost stories.&quot;	2001-05-12

Hemming's books about Great Lakes storms and shipwrecks--this volume plus his &quot;Gales of November: The Sinking of the Edmund Fitzgerald.&quot;  I prefer this book if for no other reason than it memorializes one of the most ferocious storms in Great Lakes history.  The 1913 storm blew for four days in early November (11/07 - 11/12) and sank ships on Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron (the worst hit) and Erie.  Twelve ships were sunk and anywhere from 250 to 300 sailors died (the records weren't as strictly kept back then).<br />November on the Great Lakes is always an anxious time for sailors (the Edmund Fitzgerald sank in a November storm), but the 1913 storm was a once-in-a-lifetime freak.  Three weather fronts collided over the Lakes, producing hurricane-force winds, rain, lightning, and finally record-breaking snowfalls.  The storm broke steel freighters in two, weighted them down with tons of freezing spray, pounded them with killer waves, and rolled them into the troughs between gigantic seas. It was astonishing that any lake-bound boat survived.<br />Hemming relates the destructive power of the 'Big Blow' lake by lake, ship by ship, and even sailor by sailor if there happened to be survivors.  Over Huron, where the northerly gales collided with the advancing low front from the Gulf of Mexico, the whole lake seemed to churn into the air and combine with the ice and snow of the storm.  Eight ships went down on the second largest of the Great Lakes, and there were no survivors.<br />Hemming includes a lengthy epilogue on other Great Lakes November gales, including the 1940 Armistice Day Storm, the sinking of the  Bradley in 1966, and the sinking of the Edmund Fitzgerald in 1975.<br />If you'd like to read more about the 'Big Blow' of 1913, I highly recommend Dwight Boyer's &quot;True Tales of the Great Lakes&quot; and William Ratigan's &quot;Great Lakes Shipwrecks and Survivals.&quot;	2001-05-11

James, and the Marx Brothers.&quot;<br />&quot;The Moving Toyshop,&quot; published in 1946, was Crispin's third Gervase Fen mystery.  This particular whodunit involves an unusual will, a hunt for five eccentric characters named after the nonsense poems of Edward Lear, and of course, a moving toy shop with a corpse in its upper story.  The action begins in the Autumn of 1938, when the poet, Richard Cadogan wangles an advance from his London publisher and sets out for a vacation in Oxford.<br />The reader begins to realize the oddity of the journey he has embarked upon with the poet, when Cadogan hitches a ride with truck driver who quotes Coleridge (&quot;a thahsand, thahsand slimy things lived on and so did I.&quot;) but prefers D.H. Lawrence's &quot;Lady Somebody's Lover.&quot;<br />We're entering Fen Country now, where even the truck drivers and police detectives are amateur literary critics, and our detective, Gervase Fen is the Oxford don of English Language and Literature.  Dialogue fizzes with cynical witticisms and literary allusions when Fen and the poet, Cadogan go at it, or when Fen takes on any of a number of amateur classicists who populate &quot;The Moving Toyshop.&quot;<br />All of Crispin's Fen mysteries can be read with pleasure for the dialogue alone.  This particular book also has a full cast of British eccentrics, including the five Edward Lear characters (one of whom is a murderer).<br />Here is your first limerick-clue:<br />&quot;There was an Old Person of Mold who shrank from sensations of Cold; so he purchased some muffs, some furs, and some fluffs, and wrapped himself up from the cold.&quot;<br />Racket through the streets (and sometimes the lawns) of Oxford in Fen's battered, red roadster, Lily Christine III!

There are interesting creatures galore---good, bad, and scrub demons; a Chinese magician and his daughter; a few gods and godlets;  dragons; Fu Dogs (actually lions in Chinese religious symbolism); even a stray Sidhe.<br />Kai Wren is a glassblower as well as a god-slayer, and his bottles can contain whole universes.<br />Unfortunately, the creators of  Kai Wren's own universe forgot to add the oxygen.<br />Hardly anything breathes on its own in &quot;Lord Demon,&quot; or reacts with the other elements of this book.  The Fu Dogs are given long, overly-cute stretches of text that do little to move the plot forward. There are pointless visits to the 'Hanger Plane' and the 'Sock Drawer Plane' that do nothing but serve as poignant reminders of previous journeys with Zelazny through the Shadow worlds of Amber.<br />Hard-core Zelazny fans, go ahead and read &quot;Lord Demon.&quot;  An occasional paragraph may ignite that old feeling of nostalgia.  I experienced a definite pang during Kai Wren's first encounter with the scrub demons.<br />New Zelazny readers, start with &quot;This Immortal&quot; or &quot;Lord of Light&quot; or &quot;Creatures of Light and Darkness.&quot;  The latter book, first published in 1969 was inspired by ancient Egyptian mythology, and in turn has inspired a horde of imitators but none as good.<br />&quot;A Night in the Lonesome October&quot; (1993) displays Zelazny's talent for the darkly comic.

I've already pressed &quot;Secrets of the Cat&quot; into the hands of my husband and my best friend and said, &quot;You must read this.&quot;<br /> So what were the odds that both of them would actually read the book and enjoy it?  Slim to none, I'd have guessed from previous treatments of my recommendations.<br />In this case though, both husband and friend were hooked from the first page.  The author begins with the tale of Boston Blackie, a cat who went berserk in the presence of other felines.  He ripped off their ears, he gouged out their eyes, he sent them streaking for the bushes even at feeding time.  And then, one day...but I don't want to spoil Blackie's story for you.  Just a hint - his name was changed to Basil and no anatomical alterations were involved.<br />Barbara Holland has written an extremely personal book about the history, lore, and personality of 'Felis libyca.'  In the chapter, &quot;A Choice of Cats&quot; she does riffs on many of the different feline breeds, but it is easy to see that the Siamese is her favorite:<br />&quot;Properly treated, Siamese develop a deep, single-hearted devotion to their people and overreact to competition, absences, and infidelity like an adolescent in love.  They need attention, and think nothing of pulling the books out of the bookcase and the pictures off the walls to get it.  They demand notice in a raucous, echoing voice that many people and some other cats find alarming; the sound has been compared to that of a giant sea gull in distress.  Taking on a Siamese is rather like getting married.&quot;<br />Our own preference is for Maine Coons (we share the house with five), and Barbara Holland tells a great story about them, too.  Not that I agreed with everything she wrote.  For instance, she stated that gray cats as a class are much friendlier than tabbies, which is exactly the opposite of our experience---and we've lived with two grays and about a million tabbies over the years.<br />Holland is also very upset by some of the artificially propagated breeds, such as the Cornish Rex and the Scottish Fold.  Her chapter on &quot;Show Business&quot; is sad, hilarious, and razor-sharp---sometimes all three in the same sentence.  Even if you think she is way off-base on her assessment of say, Himalayans or feline intelligence or declawing procedures,  you'll want to keep reading until the end of the book.  She is opinionated even to the point of irritation, but she is also extremely readable.<br />And Holland never confuses 'cat' with 'cute.'<br />There is one chapter in &quot;Secrets of the Cat&quot; (originally titled &quot;The Name of the Cat&quot;) that you might want to skip:  not because it is badly written, but because it is totally horrifying.

Some cats were awarded two or three ribbons.  Most cats left the show ring with at least one ribbon fluttering from their owner's hand.<br />What did it all mean?  If a cat received a brown ribbon with a rosette, was that better than being pinned with a black ribbon?<br />&quot;It's Showtime!&quot; by Phil Maggitti and J. Anne Helgren quickly instructs the reader on the mysteries of cat show scoring procedures.  For instance, a brown ribbon is very good.  It means 'best of division'.  Black is also coveted, as it is awarded to the cat that is  'best of its color class'.<br />Both authors of  &quot;It's Showtime!&quot; are veteran breeders and exhibitors within the cat fancy.  This book is aimed primarily for American and Canadian pure-bred cat owners, and goes into detail on how each of the ten different cat registering associations in North America scores its shows.<br />Why oh why couldn't we emulate the British and consolidate all of our feline organizations into one governing body?<br />There is much more to this book than keeping score at a cat show.  There are sections on picking the best cat breed for your circumstances, registering your cat and cattery, grooming and showing to win, what the judge is looking for when he or she places your cat, plus a short history of British and North American cat shows.<br />Color photographs accompany the text, most of them showing serious-looking judges and even more serious-looking exhibitors.  The occasional cranky or bored cat also makes an appearance.  I believe the photographs were meant to be interesting rather than beautiful, although the cover of &quot;It's Showtime&quot; spotlights a gorgeous Maine Coon.<br />You definitely need a copy of this book if you are planning to attend a cat show, whether to exhibit your own cat or to admire those of other cat fanciers.  In fact, I'm surprised that I've never seen copies of &quot;It's Showtime&quot; actually sold at a cat show.

However, there are more than enough calamities to horrify and fascinate disaster buffs.<br />Although Mount Pinatubo, the second-largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century may not be included in this book, the largest is (the 1912 eruption of Mt. Katmai in Alaska).  Cornell's list of the ten worst volcanic eruptions runs as follows:  (1) Krakatoa, Indonesia (1883), (2) Mount Pelee, Martinique, West Indies (1902), (3) Mount Vesuvius, Italy (A.D. 79), (4) Mount Etna, Sicily (1669), (5) Tambora, Java (1815), (6) Skaptar (Lakagigar), Iceland (1783), (7) Mount Kelud, Indonesia (1919), (8) Mount Vesuvius, Italy (1631), (9) Galunggung, Java (1822), (10)Mount Lamington, New Guinea (1951).<br />And the author doesn't just list the ten worst volcanoes, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods, etc.  He writes anywhere from a paragraph to several pages of fascinating detail on each catastrophe.<br />A random sample taken from Cornell's description of the Ohio River flood of March 16, 1913:<br />&quot;A sudden spring thaw, accompanied by heavy rains, flooded the Ohio River Valley network, causing over $100 million damage and killing between 500 and 700 people.  The worst damage was at Dayton, Ohio, where some 60 people died and the city was nearly destroyed when the Miami, Scioto, and Muskingum rivers all reached flood crests simultaneously.&quot;<br />Although the greater part of Cornell's book is devoted to natural disasters, he also spends time on calamities that we've inflicted upon ourselves.  One of the most bizarre is the 20-foot wave of molasses from the Purity Distilling Company explosion that poured through the streets of Boston in 1919, knocking down buildings and drowning 21 people.<br />&quot;The Great International Disaster Book&quot; is filled with fascinating vignettes such as the above, and the author also supplies an extensive bibliography for those of us who would like to read a more detailed version of a particular disaster.  Here are some of my own favorites:<br />&quot;A Wind to Shake the World : The Story of the 1938 Hurricane&quot; by Everett S.

The book consists of separate articles by various contributors to 'Fine Gardening' magazine.  Continuity is supplied by the subject matter,  garden beds and borders.<br />This book's articles are grouped into four sections:  (1) Design Strategies; (2) Great Border Plants; (3) Special Techniques; (4) Garden Gallery.  It begins with four articles on the design of island beds and borders.  Plant selection and placement are the topics covered by the majority of the essays, along with techniques for starting and renovating perennial beds. Gardening in the shade, in bogs, and in Southeastern heat and humidity all receive special attention in section four.<br />The one topic I felt could have used more coverage was flower bed edging techniques.  One of the authors advocated a six inch by six inch trench to separate the bed from its surroundings.  Another author, Sydney Eddison wrote an interesting article on &quot;Good Looks Begin at the Edge,&quot; but she concentrates on edging plants, rather than on the physical separation of bed and lawn.  Perhaps a future volume in the 'Fine Gardening' series will address the challenge of excluding the lawn from the flower bed (information I could certainly use).<br />Because it discusses a technique we're currently experimenting with, my favorite article in &quot;Creating Beds and Borders&quot; is &quot;Roses Enliven a Border&quot; by Judith C. McKeon.  Up until a few years ago, we segregated all of our roses into one bed, away from the other perennials (I don't remember why).  However, McKeon advocates growing roses as specimens in a mixed border:<br />&quot;When shrub roses are grown as graceful specimens in the mixed border, they become part of its architecture, giving structure and a substantial backdrop for perennial companions.  Like other ornamental deciduous shrubs, roses enhance the garden with the seasonal interest of their flowers, foliage texture and fruit displays.&quot;<br />I would only disagree with McKeon's recommendation to use the old Alba rose, 'Konigin von Danemark' as part of a mixed border.  Our specimen of 'the Queen' is a hefty seven-footer and she is absolutely covered with thorns.  Even the thorns have thorns.  If you plant one of these royal ladies in your border, you'll never work in there again unless you cover yourself in leather.<br />'Konigin von Danemark' is a beautiful, raspberry-scented rose that could possibly be used as a deer hedge.  For a mixed border, try other McKeon favorites such as 'The Fairy' or 'Gertrude Jekyll'.<br />Color photographs grace almost every page of &quot;Creating Beds and Borders&quot;.

'The Long Island Express' not only paid a visit---it dropped in unannounced on September 21, 1938 just as many summer residents were on the beach and closing up their ocean-front cottages.  The weatherman gave no cause for alarm. &quot;Cloudy skies and gusty conditions&quot; did nothing to warn New Englanders of the imminent arrival of a 500-mile wide hurricane with peak wind gusts of 180 miles an hour.<br />This is how the book jacket of &quot;A Wind to Shake the World&quot; describes the coming of the storm:<br />&quot;No one could have been prepared for the storm's ferocity.  Sweeping suddenly northward from Cape Hatteras, building tremendous momentum as it advanced, the hurricane raced over six hundred miles in only twelve hours.  Winds of 100 to 130 miles an hour and swiftly rising water of almost tidal-wave proportions slammed into the shore from South Jersey to Boston, most severely from Long Island to Cape Cod.&quot;<br />The hurricane struck Long Island around 3:30 PM. Few of the summer folk or permanent residents on the Island's south shore had a chance to escape, as waves between thirty and fifty feet high pounded the coastline.<br />Entire homes and families were swept into the ocean.<br />September 21st was also the day that Everett S. Allen, recent college graduate and future author of &quot;A Wind to Shake the World&quot;, began his first 'real' job as a reporter for the New Bedford 'Standard Times.'<br />It took Allen over thirty years to recover from his own traumatic experiences during the storm, and write about one of the most under-reported natural disasters of 20th century America.  Six hundred New Englanders were killed in less than twelve hours, and yet it is very difficult to find accounts of the hurricane that came to be called &quot;The Long Island Express&quot;.  I first heard of it in a story told by one of my Down East relatives---<br />&quot;On the day of the hurricane, a Yankee farmer received a package containing a barometer that he had ordered through the mail.  No matter how many times he tapped it, the mercury remained stuck at the bottom of the glass.  Finally, he re-packaged the 'broken' barometer and returned it to the post office.  By the time he got back to his own property, his house had washed out to sea.&quot;<br />If you are an armchair junkie of natural disaster stories such as &quot;Isaac's Storm: A Man, a Time, and the Deadliest Hurricane in History,&quot; you should definitely read  &quot;A Wind to Shake the World.&quot;  Although the survivors were interviewed over thirty years after the hurricane, Allen wrote that some of them still wept, &quot;to see again the sick color of sky and sea on that day, to hear the scream of the wind, which was everywhere...to see man himself, face down and weaving like weed in the roiling shallows or open-mouthed and still, half-buried in the damp sand.&quot;ankee farmer received a package containing a barometer that he had ordered through the mail.

Instead of producing horror of the ghost-ghoul-goblin variety (although there is one vampire who preys only on her own blood-relatives), P.D. Cacek has tapped into a morbid, 'magical reality' for her stories.  Two of her characters are dying of cancer and their loved ones can't let them go.  A boutique shop owner and her employee try to cope with the death of a beautiful doll.  An old woman protects her favorite grandchild from her dying husband's 'leavings'.<br />Merlin, a unicorn, and a gargoyle make an appearance in three of the stories, but for the most part, Cacek ignores the usual fantasy stereotypes and concentrates on twisting an ordinary life off-center, especially in the presence of death.<br />The blurb on the back cover states, &quot;Not since Rod Serling terrified an entire generation with his 'Twilight Zone' series has anyone tapped into the well of fear that exists inside the human soul the way P.D. Cacek does...&quot;<br />That's coming on a bit strong.  Cacek didn't tap into my 'well of fear'.  I don't think she meant to.  'Terrifying' is not the adjective I'd use to describe any of the stories in &quot;Leavings&quot;.  They are morbid, occasionally obsessive, sometimes humorous stories with dead-on characterizations (my favorite is the boyfriend from hell in &quot;Heart of Stone&quot;).<br />&quot;Ancient One&quot; comes closest to terror, but the monster under the crib is telegraphed way in advance of its actual appearance.<br />&quot;Under the Haystack&quot; may have a ghost, but it is really the story of a woman who loses her unborn child.<br />&quot;Leavings&quot; has many good stories, misleadingly advertised.	2001-04-23

Although &quot;Iberia&quot; was originally published in 1968 (and spent the next seven months on the &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller list), we used it eleven years later to plan our first trip to Spain.  It had not gone out-of-date.  If it had aged at all, it was in Michener's less-than-balanced account of the Spanish Civil War (of course the same could be said of Hemingway).<br />&quot;Iberia&quot; is a massive, thousand-page love affair with Spain, part history, part travelogue, and part parador-and-tapa-bar guide.  It is not 'merely' a tour guide to Spain, any more than Rebecca West's &quot;Black Lamb and Grey Falcon&quot; is 'merely' a tour guide to Yugoslavia.  With the possible exception of his Pulitzer Prize winning &quot;Tales of the South Pacific&quot;, I believe this to be Michener's finest work.<br />My opinion (or prejudice) is based on our unforgettable journey through Spain.  Michener took us places we never would have found in the standard tourist guides.  We pigged out in his tapa bars-&quot;first comes the seafood--- the anchovies, eel, squid, octopus, herring, shrimp, salmon, five kinds of sardines, five kinds of fish; next come the boiled eggs, deviled eggs, egg salad, potato omelets cut in strips, vegetables, onions, salads; third are the cold meats in great variety, including meat balls, York ham, Serran ham, tripe, brains, liver in a variety of styles, beef, pork and veal; and finally the hot dishes...&quot;<br />I booked us into many of the paradors that he recommended.  Paradors are combination  hotel-museums, which serve some of the best food in Spain---&quot;Where practical, the paradors are housed in ancient buildings, such as old convents, monasteries, castles no longer in use, hospitals dating back to the age of the Catholic Kings, or inns in which Columbus may have slept.&quot;<br />In Merida, we stayed in a parador that is housed in the 500-year-old Convento de los Frailes de Jesus (Michener's personal favorite).  Then there was the castle-parador, the parador that is built within the Alhambra, and the modern, ski-resort parador on the slopes of Monte Perdido.  We stumbled across the last-mentioned resort while lost in the Pyrenees, and had it literally to ourselves (and one other couple), since the season was late spring.<br />My one regret is that we did not get to attend the ancient horse fair that follows Holy Week in Seville, and is so lovingly described in &quot;Iberia.&quot;  This fair dates back &quot;two thousand years to the days when Romans came here to buy horses for their generals...If a man likes horses, this rough-and-ready market with no rules and little order would delight him.  It is conducted under a blazing sun and has about it a strange and ancient quality.  I have attended at three different times and found it difficult to believe that I was in the twentieth century...&quot;<br />If you are planning a trip to Spain, book yourself into the paradors well in advance of your trip (at least a year in advance if you plan to visit during or immediately after Holy Week), try to attend Seville's ancient horse fair, and above all, buy and read Michener's &quot;Iberia.&quot;is housed in the 500-year-old Convento de los Frailes de Jesus (Michener's personal favorite).

First-line supervision is not a very glamorous topic and this book fills a definite information gap.  I have owned a copy of &quot;The Effective Supervisor's Handbook&quot; for at least five years, and I reference it at least one or two times a month.<br />On the other hand, its author never overlooks an opportunity to state and restate and re-restate the obvious.  Here is a sample from the section, &quot;Self-interest and Work&quot;:<br />&quot;As participants in society, people hold memberships in various organizations.  Some memberships are voluntary, whereas others are somewhat involuntary.  Except for those activities or organizations where membership and participation are involuntary, people usually have a choice of withdrawing from membership.&quot;<br />The climax to this section is, &quot;No one can force you to stay at a job.&quot;<br />The normal reaction upon completing this section is, 'why did we just spend two pages on something this obvious?'<br />&quot;The Effective Supervisor's Handbook&quot; is exactly as advertised.  It has sensible advice for everything from managing the office grapevine, to the benefits and risks of counseling employees.  If you are a first-line supervisor, ignore the truck-loads of trendy books on 'leadership' and 'management.'  Buy this book, put your waders on, and fish out the bits that apply to your particular situation.<br />Just don't attempt to read it from cover to cover.s.

Otherwise this book will probably remind you of a long Sunday School spin through the 'begats' in the Book of Genesis.<br />However, Bowen has produced a treasure for those of us who like to flip to the back pages of  &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot; every week and pore over the genealogy charts of the stakes winners.  If you catch a loved one doing this and muttering phrases like, &quot;Inbred 3x4 to Nijinsky II, eh?  No wonder she toes out,&quot; then &quot;Matriarchs&quot; could be 'the' perfect birthday gift.<br />Edward L. Bowen is an Eclipse Award-winning Turf writer, formerly editor-in-chief of &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot; magazine, and currently president of the Grayson-Jockey Club Research Foundation.  I believe his most recently published book is &quot;Nashua,&quot; which is volume eight of the 'Thoroughbred Legends' series.<br />In &quot;Matriarchs&quot;, Bowen ambles gently through the race records, sales histories, and 'begats' of 20th century America's twenty-four most influential Thoroughbred matriarchs.  There are also black-and-white photographs and (of course) genealogy charts of the mares and their famous descendants.  The author fleshes out what could have been a very dry volume of statistics with anecdotes about the mares and their colorful owners, and some of the theorizing that goes into the breeding of these beautiful, courageous animals.  Here is his riff on The Bride, a foal of Somethingroyal:<br />&quot;In 1969, Somethingroyal foaled a Bold Ruler filly who went to Ogden Phipps [as part of a foal sharing agreement]...Named The Bride, she was unplaced, but produced stakes winners At Ease and Heavenly Match.  Short of winning the Derby or rescuing children from a burning building, there was little The Bride could have done to avoid being known in history as the one-who-was-not-Secretariat.&quot;<br />&quot;Matriarchs&quot; should be savored for its rich detail, not read in one sitting.

I writhed with shame.	&quot;Self-Editing for Fiction Writers&quot; literally had me writhing.  At least my toes curled and I kept saying, &quot;Ouch,&quot; as chapter after chapter critiqued yet another one of my cherished writing habits ('Tom Swifties' for one).  I have two suggestions for potential readers: (1) bypass &quot;Self-Editing for Fiction Writers&quot; completely if you have a delicate ego; (2) if you do read it, stock up on several different colors of magic markers and keep your manuscript nearby.  It will soon be streaming with color.<br />Renni Browne and Dave King also explain why self-editing, &quot;is probably the only kind of editing your manuscript will ever get.&quot;  Many publishing houses have eliminated the tedious step of editing a promising manuscript to bring it up to its full potential.  If they like it coming in the door, the manuscript is published 'as is'!<br />I'm sorry, Renni and Dave.  I had to use an exclamation point to end that last sentence. Your book explains why I've been struggling through so many bloated fantasy novels, lately.  The editors who used to take a red pencil to them are now gone missing, probably in the interests of 'cost cutting'.  And if there is anyone out there who still believes fantasy novels do get edited, read &quot;Rhapsody: Child of Blood&quot; by Elizabeth Haydon.<br />&quot;Self-Editing for Fiction Writers&quot; is not just for the unpublished.  The authors take examples of bad dialogue mechanics or second-hand reporting right out of the classics and show us how to rectify them.  F. Scott Fitzgerald, Henry James, and P.D. James all take their lumps in this book, and once you've seen how Renni and Dave improve these authors' paragraphs, you will probably agree with them (I did).  You also get to practice on &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; yourself in one of the exercises that follows the chapter on &quot;Dialogue Mechanics&quot;.<br />Each chapter except the last in &quot;Self-Editing for Fiction Writers&quot; has a checklist that you can take to your own manuscript.  I used all eleven of the checklists on mine, and all I can say is, thank God for the 'cut and paste feature' in word processors.  This novel of mine originally started out on a typewriter, and I would have been forced to commit hara-kiri if I'd read this book before 'cut and paste' was invented.<br />Seriously, this is a most helpful book for would-be 'published' authors of fiction.

Each racehorse is pictured with accompanying statistics.  Stories flesh out the statistics and try to give us a feeling for the drama inherent in owning, or working with, or following the career of one of these beautiful animals.  One of my favorite stories describes Personal Ensign's final race:<br />&quot;Four lengths were all that separated Personal Ensign from a perfect career.  With an eight of a mile to go in the 1988 Breeders' Cup distaff, it seemed an impossible amount of ground for the bay filly to close on the leader, Winning Colors.  It took about fourteen seconds for that final eighth to be run, but it seemed like an eternity.  Personal Ensign closed the gap relentlessly, inching slowly toward Winning Colors, and at the wire, she thrust a desperate nose in front of her younger rival.&quot;<br />I watched that last race of hers on T.V.  I was recovering from abdominal surgery at the time, and I think I must have busted a stitch or two trying to 'help' Personal Ensign down that muddy track and over the finish line ahead of her rival (who had already won the 1988 Kentucky Derby).<br />Because these equine champions mean so much to some of us, there has been and will be lots of disagreement over the order in which they were placed on the list.  Why, for instance does Easy Goer appear ahead of both Ruffian and Personal Ensign, not to mention Busher, Twilight Tear, and Dahlia?  Both Busher and Twilight Tear were voted Horse of the Year---an honor that eluded Easy Goer.<br />Here is the list as compiled by the seven panel members chosen by &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot;:<br />1.

2034440:US	53084107	R16ZG49LSLNFPA	0060278234	895619710	Lirael: Daughter of the Clayr	Books	4	31	37	N	Y	(1) Sabriel (2) Lirael (3) Abhorsen	&quot;Lirael&quot; is neither the beginning nor the end (thank goodness) of this remarkable fantasy series by Garth Nix.  If you haven't already read &quot;Sabriel&quot;, you might want to put &quot;Lirael&quot; aside and begin at the beginning.  The middle book could stand alone, especially the story of Lirael herself, but you will miss nuances of the Philosophy and Geography of Death if you don't start with &quot;Sabriel&quot;.  The only work I can compare this series to is Philip Pullman's &quot;Golden Compass&quot; trilogy, although I prefer Nix's magical world-building.  If I ever die and go to fantasy heaven, I hope it resembles his immense library beneath glacier and mountain, where each door opens into a separate mystery.  In the catacombs beneath the library, Lirael discovers how to turn herself into an ice otter or a barking owl, reads &quot;The Book of Remembrance and Forgetting&quot;, and duels with the monstrous Stilken.<br />However, &quot;Lirael&quot; isn't just about Lirael.  Prince Sameth, heir apparent to Sabriel as the Old Kingdom's champion against evil necromancers, also comes of age in this volume.  There are plenty of evil necromancers to go around.  In fact, at the end of this book, it appears as though they are winning the war to turn the Old Kingdom into a kingdom of the dead.<br />One fault should be noted. The two main characters spend too much text feeling sorry for themselves.  Lirael pursues an impossible dream, while Prince Sameth tries to escape from an impossible nightmare.  I think the author's editor must have read &quot;Sabriel&quot; and said, &quot;Garth, this is a great fantasy but your heroine, Sabriel is pretty darn self-sufficient.  Readers can't relate to that.  You need to make your characters more vulnerable.&quot;  So that's exactly what Nix did in Volume Two.  Vulnerability often shades over into self-pity in &quot;Lirael&quot;---too often for my liking.  It's not enough of an annoyance to bypass this fantasy.  Hopefully, in the yet-to-be-published &quot;Abhorsen&quot;, Lirael and Prince Sameth will stop whining and take up the burden of defending the Old Kingdom.  Lirael is already headed in that direction, along with her friend the Disreputable Dog.<br />Garth, I advise you to stop listening to your editor.  You were pitch-perfect in &quot;Sabriel&quot;. Retune 'Astarael, the Sorrowful' that &quot;casts all who hear it deep into Death&quot; and finish this marvelous trilogy the way you began it.ly, in the yet-to-be-published &quot;Abhorsen&quot;, Lirael and Prince Sameth will stop whining and take up the burden of defending the Old Kingdom.

It would have been either the high-point or low-point of our trip if we'd actually caught sight of a long-departed Lord or Lady.  It bothers me to realize that we visited Glamis Castle (the most haunted of all royal residences) and the Tower of London without a clue as to what we really might have seen.<br />However, your trip doesn't need to be spoiled by that same oversight, because Marc Alexander has published the ultimate tour guide to the haunted castles of Great Britain.  His book was published back in 1974, but I don't imagine that it has gone out-of-date.  What do the Grey Ladies, Phantom Pipers, and assorted ghostly prisoners in their dungeons care about the passage of time?  According to the author, some of them have been haunting the same spot for several hundred years.<br />Of course, the phantoms may have been exorcised if they frightened too many tourists, so you are still advised to call in advance of your visit.<br />The author himself tried to visit many of the haunted castles, and he writes very atmospheric stories about the not-so-departed departed.  He also narrates a brief, painless history of each site mentioned in this book.  A sampling:<br />Rochester Castle, Kent - &quot;A girl, her body transfixed by an arrow and an expression of terror beneath her wildly flowing hair, is the spectre of Rochester Castle which is still seen after seven centuries&quot;<br />Roslin Castle, Midlothian - Sir Walter Scott wrote a poem about the ghostly portent that precedes the death of a lord of Roslin Castle (now a ruin):  &quot;...Blazed battlement and pinnet high,/ Blazed every rose-carved buttress fair;/ So still they blaze, when fate is nigh/ The lordly line of Hugh St Clair.&quot;<br />If you enjoyed these stories about burning death portents and ghostly, arrowed brides, Marc Anderson has also published &quot;Haunted Inns&quot;, &quot;Haunted Churches &amp; Abbeys of Britain &quot;, and &quot;Phantom Britain&quot;.of Britain &quot;, and &quot;Phantom Britain&quot;.	2001-04-11

After all, fairy tales are not just for kids.  And they're not for wimpy adults, either.  Just read &quot;The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales&quot; by Maria Tatar if you don't believe me.  &quot;Stardust&quot; has some pretty Grimm stuff in it too, however the only people who might not enjoy it are those who take Unicorns very very seriously.  Or are extremely fond of billy goats.<br />Gaiman's story begins and ends with a fair that will remind you of Christina Rossetti's &quot;Goblin Market&quot;:<br />&quot;Backwards up the mossy glen/ Turned and trooped the goblin men,/ With their shrill repeated cry,/ &quot;Come buy, come buy.&quot;.../ One set his basket down,/ One reared his plate;/ One began to weave a crown/ Of tendrils, leaves, and rough nuts brown/ (Men sell not such in any town);/ One heaved the golden weight Of dish and fruit to offer her:/ &quot;Come buy, come buy,&quot; was still their cry.&quot;<br />As Laura of &quot;Goblin Market&quot;-fame learned, it is better not to sample the merchandise at such  Unseelie gatherings.  Dunstan Thorn, who &quot;was not romantic&quot; learns this lesson too, when nine months after the &quot;Stardust&quot; fair, a baby is abandoned at the boundary between Faerie and the English village of Wall with his name pinned to its blanket.  Thus begins the story of Tristan Thorn who is raised as a proper Victorian lad until age seventeen.  Unlike his father, Tristan is romantic and at the bequest of the most beautiful girl in Wall, he sets out on a quest through the Land of Faerie to fetch her a fallen star.  Not just any fallen star, but the one Tristan and Victoria both saw on the night she refused to kiss him.<br />&quot;Stardust&quot; is stuffed with stock fairy tale creatures who have been blown loose from their moorings and brought to life in the most wildly imaginative way.  Some of them make only token appearances, but all are memorable.  Two of the most poignant are the boy who is turned into a billy goat, and a billy goat, turned into a boy.  There are three truly evil witches, and one who is only so-so wicked.  There are....well, read the book.  Even if you aren't drinking while you read it, you'll feel drunk by the time you finish.<br />If ever there was a book that could be labeled, 'Drink me!', &quot;Stardust&quot; is that book.<br />P.S.

It begins several years after the Turning, when the Witches of Estcarp reshaped the mountains between themselves and their enemies. Those who did not flee from the heights when the mountains surged and foamed and changed shape like waves in the ocean, were destroyed.  This book is the story of Tirtha, a woman of part-witch blood who hires a Falconer, a soldier whose home was destroyed by the Turning, to guide her over the mountains. She is under a geas to return to her deserted ancestral hold and recover a treasure that was hidden when her family was slain by the enemies of Estcarp.  Her journey over-mountain is made even more perilous by a Dark One who is determined to foil Tirtha's quest.<br />&quot;'Ware Hawk&quot; is a classical Norton confrontation between a determined and seemingly powerless heroine and a sophisticated, all-powerful Dark magician.  If you are already a Witch World fan, this book is a 'must read'.	2001-04-07

I have their &quot;20 rules for good writing&quot; taped up next to my PC, and my first SF novel (alas, not yet published) and I graduated together from the Writer's Digest School.  WDS matched me up with a published Science Fiction writer and he critiqued my novel very thoroughly.  It was a good, albeit slightly expensive learning experience.<br />&quot;The Writer's Digest Handbook of Novel Writing&quot; expands upon much of the advice that I received from my 'personal' WDS tutor.  It is composed of a series of essays that were originally published in &quot;Writer's Digest&quot; by authors such as Loren D. Estleman (&quot;Five Ways to Strengthen Fiction With Dialogue&quot;) and Orson Scott Card (&quot;Creating Characters That Readers Care About&quot;).<br />I believe you will find this book inspirational if you're pregnant with a novel but have not yet conceived a single word.<br />It will be useful (in the slightly disorganized manner of essays by multiple authors) if you've already started to write but would like to improve your craft.<br />If you are like me and have already discovered the hard, cold truth about the slush piles that lurk behind every publishing house, try Tom Clancy's chapter on &quot;How to Write a Bestselling Novel&quot;.<br />Another suggestion for writers who want to improve their fiction--join one of the web-based writing groups where your fiction will be critiqued by your peers (and you will critique theirs).  One of the best groups that I've been involved with over the years is the Critters Workshop (fantasy, horror, science fiction).  Many of its members have been published (and paid!), and according to the &quot;Writer's Digest&quot; editors, Critters is &quot;well run and quite stable&quot;.<br />Good luck and good writing!<br />And as my husband keeps telling me, &quot;Don't quit your day job!&quot;	2001-04-04

Last year (2000) Slew underwent surgery to fuse two vertebrae in his neck and alleviate pressure on his spinal cord.  The feisty twenty-seven year-old is back in the breeding shed this year and his first mares have been pronounced in foal, so maybe we'll be privileged to watch many more champions by this extraordinary Thoroughbred.<br />Dan Mearns's book is number five in the &quot;Thoroughbred Legends&quot; series and he covers Seattle Slew from his birth (an ugly foal with big floppy brown ears), through his racing and breeding career, up into the year 2000.  For those of us who admire racing's only undefeated Triple Crown Winner (Slew did lose a few after the Triple Crown races), this book is a satisfying read.  There are also sixteen pages of black-and-white photographs of Slew from his ugly-duckling birth through a picture where we can see a few gray whiskers dotting his muzzle.<br />May the Slew live a thousand years through his offspring!	2001-04-01

The author gives directions to the various churches, ruined abbeys, priories, graveyards, and pubs (yes, pubs) in Great Britain that are reputed to be haunted by religious bodies.  There are also a few white ladies, haunted clocks, a cockatrice, and several ghostly bears (not just the famous one in the Tower of London) thrown in for good measure.  Here are two of the sites that the author describes:<br />--The haunted clock of Veryan Church in Cornwell is reputed to, &quot;foretell death in the village should it strike on a Sunday morning during the pre-sermon hymn or before the collect against devils at evensong.&quot;  The unlucky villager thus forewarned will die before the next Sunday.  (You may want to visit Veryan on a day other than Sunday).<br />--King Harold Godwinson (who was buried in Waltham Abbey, Essex) reputedly haunts Battle Abbey (in Sussex).  If you are one of those who believe that he was the last true King of England, &quot;go to Battle in Sussex, which stands on the A2100 north of Hastings&quot; and see if you can spot a bloodied figure gazing over the battlefield of Senlac (&quot;Sonlac!  Sanguelac, The lake of Blood.&quot;).  If you visit this 1066 battleground after a rainstorm, you may also see the earth &quot;sweating blood&quot;.<br />The author himself tried to visit as many of the haunted sites as possible, and he writes very readable vignettes on the ghostly throngs that glide over Britain's hallowed ground.  If you enjoy reading this book, Marc Anderson has also published &quot;Haunted Inns&quot;, &quot;Haunted Castles&quot;, and &quot;Phantom Britain&quot;.	2001-03-29
2052706:US	53084107	R32JMQJJMB0H37	0393310086	510608820	The Malaria Capers: Tales of Parasites and People	Books	3	9	9	N	Y	Thought-provoking study of Malaria and Kala Azar	Robert Desowitz leaves his readers with many 'cliff-hangers' in &quot;The Malaria Capers&quot;.  The version I read was published in 1991, so some of his unfinished stories may have endings by now---all except for the most important story of all, which is the search for an effective vaccine against the parasitic protozoans that cause malaria and kala azar (visceral leishmaniasis).<br />Immunization campaigns have eradicated smallpox and may be on the verge of eradicating polio, but the two diseases that this book focuses on cannot currently be prevented with vaccines.  The danger of catching malaria or kala azar can be minimized---unfortunately the majority of the population at risk can't even afford the most effective preventive measure---a bed net soaked in insecticide (according to 2000 World Health Organization statistics this costs about $4, plus $1 per year for a supply of insecticide).<br />No wonder Desowitz gets so mad and preachy in &quot;The Malaria Capers&quot;.  Malaria still kills over one million people a year (another 2000 WHO statistic) - most of them young children.  None of the vaccines that scientists were working on when this book was written have proven to be effective, which is exactly what Desowitz predicted.  In his last chapter, &quot;The Vaccine Felonies&quot;, he excoriates the Malaria researchers who spent their AID grants on vaccines that were already proven to be ineffective and unsafe for humans.  While doing so, they diverted funding from proven preventive measures such as bed nets, put Owl monkeys on the endangered species list, and (even more feloniously according to our laws) lavished the grant money on themselves and their office assistants.  One of the stories that Desowitz couldn't finish in 1991 was whether these researchers were tried, convicted, and sent to prison.<br />This book is more polemical and as a result, less interesting to the lay reader (myself) than his &quot;New Guinea Tapeworms and Jewish Grandmothers&quot;, but it does have a few 'human interest' stories.  The most haunting begins in a small Thai village:<br />&quot;...The school assembly bell, hanging by a rope from a limb of a mango tree, is the nose cone from an unexploded [Japanese] bomb.  Next to the school, raised on pillars, is the wooden residence of a group of monks.  On this late morning in June their prayers have ended; only the unceasing anguished cries of a monk dying from throat cancer break the subdued quiet of the village.  In a one-room, wood-framed, tin pan-roofed house at the village edge, Amporn Punyagaputa, twenty-three years old and big with child, sits alone, feverish and confused by the searing pain in her head.&quot;<br />Stories like this represent Desowitz at his best and most humane.  I can almost guarantee that Amporn Punyagaputa will help you remember why Malaria is still such a killer, long after you've  forgotten who misappropriated the AID funds.  And you will definitely understand why Desowitz is so angry.  You'll be angry, too.but it does have a few 'human interest' stories.

The heroine, Siggy is your basic B-average high school graduate who needs to go off-world to find a job (jobs are very scarce in this future universe), and ends up working as a janitor at the Institute for the Criminally Insane.  Siggy grew up in the midst of a galactic cold war that occasionally turned hot, and the technologically superior Enemy is still trying to decide whether or not to exterminate the human race once and for all.  It doesn't help our side one bit, when a serial killer who thinks he's the Antichrist is turned loose in alien territory.<br />All of Maggy Thomas's characters came to life for me, even the alien 'Speedies' and the serial killers in 'Monster Row'.  Her heroine, Siggy is open, friendly, and smart, and teaches ballroom dancing just for fun.  She is neither passive nor timid, in spite of the fact that she doesn't know what she really wants to do for a living (how many of us did at her age?).  She doesn't back down from murderers, sadistic guards, or even angry aliens.  Notwithstanding her lowly status, Siggy never gives up on her determination to find the Lost Boy, teach the Speedies how to dance, and make the Galaxy a safer place for humanity.  What she does flows naturally from who she is.<br />&quot;Broken Time&quot; has a strong plot that bubbles along with enough future-tech gobble-de-gook to keep us geekish readers happy trying to deconstruct the theory behind 'time pockets' and artificially speeded-up humans.  And there are enough loose threads at its end to make me hope for a sequel.<br />Maggy, don't disappoint me. I want to read more about the indomitable Siggy!	2001-03-26

It is a wonderful book to curl up with in the winter when your garden is covered with snow.  The pictures are beautiful and in color, although I wish there were more of them (I think I've been spoiled by the photos in the Iris catalogues that show up in my mailbox every Spring).  The author has definite opinions as to which varieties work best in the garden.  In his chapter on &quot;The Value of Iris in the Garden&quot; he states the following:<br />&quot;Perhaps it is because the bearded iris show such variety that many gardeners do not look elsewhere in the genus for garden plants.  This is a mistake, however, because although the deep, blackcurrent purple of 'Superstition' may have a velvety sheen, a ruffling and size that are hard to match, the deep purple of forms of 'I. Chrysographes' are augmented by bright golden markings on a flower of refinement and poise that makes the other look clumsy and almost grotesque.&quot;<br />The tall, bearded Iris also gets short shrift in the popular &quot;The Well-Tended Perennial Garden&quot; by Tracy DiSabato-Aust, but I would venture to say that theirs is the minority opinion among gardeners.  Most of us love the bearded irises for their gorgeous colors and perfumes, and in spite of their short season of bloom.  This book's longest chapter is on the Tall Bearded Iris, so it can't be said that the author neglects them.  There are also chapters on the Siberian Iris, the Pacific Coast Iris, the Water Iris, the Spuria Iris, the Stinking Iris, the Dwarf Bulbous Iris, and &quot;Iris for the Specialist&quot;.<br />As interesting as this book is to read, it is not really organized to help you locate a quick paragraph on what to do about the Iris borer grub that you just discovered in your 'Beverly Sills' rhizome.  In fact 'iris borer' isn't even listed in the index.  If you flip to the lone page on 'pests', you won't find them there, either-just a few miscellaneous paragraphs on aphids and wet rot.<br />Buy &quot;The Gardener's Guide to Growing Irises&quot; if you love irises and would like to learn more about them.  However, you might want to look elsewhere for a straightforward guide to growing and caring for these lovely flowers.one page on 'pests', you won't find them there, either-just a few miscellaneous paragraphs on aphids and wet rot.  <br />Buy &quot;The Gardener's Guide to Growing Irises&quot; if you love irises and would like to learn more about them.

It seems to have started out as fantasy, then switched to science fiction midway through the manuscript.  The hero and heroine, who both practice white magic, ride to the rescue of one of their comrades in a hi-tech tank.  Although Norton successfully combined magic and technology in some of the early Witch World novels, it doesn't work as well in &quot;Moon Called&quot;.  Thora, the heroine is also a bit too prickly and too inclined to argue about religion to be likeable.  Dialogue (never a Norton strong point) is exceptionally stilted and long-winded.  Thora is given lines like, &quot;Him also do all who serve the Lady call enemy,&quot; and &quot;I am one with those who draw the Moon---though I was not yet brought to Her as one of the Three.&quot;<br />The action scenes and the confrontation of white versus dark magic are vintage Norton, both suspenseful and eerie, so there is meat in &quot;Moon Called&quot; for the die-hard fan (I've read it at least three times).  However, I would recommend &quot;The Crystal Gryphon&quot; or &quot;Year of the Unicorn&quot; as a 'starter fantasy' for those who are not yet familiar with this fine author.	2001-03-23

Here is how to use this book:<br />Suppose you live in Michigan and want to know whether to prune your climbing roses in March.  Turn to Chapter 7, &quot;Roses&quot; and the subchapter called, &quot;March&quot;.  This subchapter has sections on &quot;Planning&quot;, &quot;Planting and Transplanting&quot;, &quot;Rx Care for Your Roses&quot;, etc.  In the section entitled &quot;Pruning&quot;, the author recommends, &quot;Prune climbing rose plants to fit their supports.  Remove thin canes, and pinch back overly vigorous canes to force branching.&quot;<br />This book is very easy to use, as you can see from the above paragraph.  I used to live in Winter Hardiness Zone 3 near Cadillac and am now a Zone 6 gardener down near Lake St. Claire , so I know from experience that you might have to adjust Fizzell's time-table of recommendations by as much as three or four weeks, depending on your specific zone.<br />Organic gardeners probably won't want to use some of the author's &quot;Rx Care&quot; suggestions  (Fizzell recommends actual products such as &quot;Orthene&quot; and &quot;D-Con&quot;), but other than that, &quot;Month-by-Month Gardening in Michigan&quot; should prove useful to all of us who garden in this state, whether it be the 'helpful hints', the planting charts, or the month-specific instructions for tending to your water garden.<br />This is a handy reference for any Michigan gardener (like myself) who needs an occasional reminder not to start her pepper plants in January.	2001-03-22

This book was originally published in 1965, and several of the stories are of pre-war and World War II vintage.  Bardens also includes several often-published stories such as the ghostly bear in the Tower of London, Lord Soulis and his pact with the Devil, and the haunting of Borley Rectory.  He tries to stick to accounts that had two or more witnesses who were willing to corroborate each other.  For some of his chosen hauntings, there were a hundred or more witnesses, and for others, the story was too good to omit even if only one person had seen or heard the ghost.<br />Haunted ships are well represented in &quot;Ghosts and Hauntings&quot;, although Bardens' 'Flying Dutchman' doesn't resemble the 'Flying Dutchman' I'd heard about from other sources (What plague?  What pirates?).  If you were frightened by that horrid little ghost story, &quot;The Upper Berth&quot;, then this book's seafaring ghosts will really raise the hair on the back of your neck.  I swear I'll never go on another cruise!<br />One minor problem I had with &quot;Ghosts and Hauntings&quot; was that the author kept interjecting his theories on the origins of supernatural phenomena into the stories.  I think his writing would have been even more eerie and interesting if he had simply reported the hauntings, and kept his theories of cerebral electricity for another publication.<br />Definitely read Barden's book if you enjoy excursions into the realm of true hauntings.  Just go quickly over the parts about electricity in the brain.	2001-03-19

It's the type of book that is handed out at two-day training seminars for new supervisors, i.e. heavy on bulleted lists and self-assessment quizzes, and somewhat light on content.<br />What does it mean to be a supervisor at a large to medium-size corporation, trapped as we are between the rock of upper management and the hard place inhabited by the people we are supposed to supervise?  For one thing, it means we don't get much respect.  Here is a direct quotation from the feedback section of my company's March newsletter:<br />&quot;I see little contribution to our company's success when it comes to any employee in a supervisory/area leader role!&quot;<br />Supervisors also don't get very much training (my company is a refreshing exception to this rule-although I'm not sure it helped in my case). Many of us come up through the technical ranks without a clue as to how to manage people instead of computers or warehouse stock or company finances.  Therefore books like &quot;How to Supervise People&quot; can play an important role.  This particular book, written by Donald P. Ladew, has valuable (although terse) guidelines in areas such as demonstrating leadership, handling people, team-building, and communication.  At the beginning of each chapter, the author tells us what we're going to learn.  Then the bullets and summaries come flying at us.  We are given a brief pause to write up a plan, or reflect on the qualities of a supervisor we admire, or take a self-assessment quiz.  The chapter then ends with yet another summary of what we should have learned.  Biff.  Bam.  Boom. The End---an example of what the back cover calls an 'interactive format'.<br />I think books like &quot;How to Supervise People&quot; are particularly valuable for a quick review when I'm trying to solve a stressful, possibly long-term problem.  It gives me a chance to organize my thoughts, come up with a plan to achieve a positive outcome (instead of giving in to my natural tendency to strangle the person who is causing the problem), and reflect on what I'm really trying to accomplish. Here is a list of the basic qualities that this book feels a supervisor should possess.  I think it's a good one:<br />&quot;1. Be an advocate for the people who report to you. 2. Be fair without playing favorites or being a 'pal.' 3. Create an environment where work can be accomplished. 4. Provide stability during times of change. 5. You must have courage.&quot;<br />Maybe I should post the above list on the wall of my cubicle, for those times when someone else claims that we supervisors make &quot;little contribution&quot;!olve a stressful, possibly long-term problem.

All of the main characters are loveable, earnest, and in some cases bumbling-- even the Witch-finder Sargeant.  There are a couple of despicable (but bumbling) demons, and the Horsepersons of the Apocalypse are flat-out evil.  The latter inhabit all of the truly scary corners of this book, but for the most part it is cross-eyed, cock-a-hoop, British tongue-firmly-in-cheek funny.<br />And the Snake doesn't have _all_ the lines.  Agnes Nutter, the Adversary (Destroyer of Kings, Angel of the Bottomless Pit, Great Beast that is called Dragon, Prince of This World, Father of Lies, Spawn of Satan, and Lord of Darkness),Aziraphale (technically a Principality), the 'hoor of Babylon', and the Witch-finders Sargeant and Private get in a few good ones, too.<br />&quot;Good Omens&quot; is a classic.<br />Metatron says you've got to read it.<br />Before next Saturday.ys you've got to read it.<br />Before next Saturday.	2001-03-16

There is something about the quality of light shimmering through a fringe of translucent beads that I find particularly soothing and pretty.  &quot;The Beaded Lampshade Book&quot; by Wendy Simpson Conner caters to that taste, although not always in the way that I expected it to.  Some of the patterns in this book involve nets that are woven to cover an entire lampshade, shades that are decorated by cementing beads onto them, and shades that are completely constructed of freeform woven beads.  Out of a total of thirteen lampshade designs included in this 49-page book, only three (the Commanche Stitch Lampshade, the Art Deco Lampshade, and the Turkish Lampshade) conformed to my preconceived notion of what a beaded shade should look like.  Wendy Simpson Conner takes her readers way beyond a mere fringe!<br />The author is very clear on what materials are needed to create each of the 13 lampshades.  The drawings and photographs that accompany the text are in black and white, although there are four pages of colored photographs showing the finished lampshades.  A more liberal employment of color in some of the complicated bead patterns would have been a definite improvement.  All in all, though, this is a useful little spiral-bound guide for the beaded lampshade fanatic.	2001-03-15

A story from Gaelic mythology is clumsily translated, and the author spends too much print on his own classification scheme for ghosts.<br />Some of the stories in this book appear to be incompletely edited--In the chapter on &quot;Strange Happenings&quot;, the author quotes at length from a friend who ecountered a ghostly piper, and it seemed to me as though his story was copied from a letter whose pages were jumbled together in the wrong order.  One moment the friend is strolling along the burn, the next moment he is roused from his bed by the sound of a ghostly piper.<br />Also, many of the stories in &quot;Ghosts Spritis and Spectres of Scotland&quot; have been told elsewhere, most notably in James Robertson's &quot;Scottish Ghost Stories&quot;.<br />Nevertheless, this book still earns its four stars.  In chapter 6, &quot;Tales of Horror&quot; the author lets out all of the stops, and I had to go seek human companionship before I could finish the story about the haunted house in the neighborhood of Glasgow's Blythswood Square.  In &quot;Ghostly Noises and Lights&quot;, there are lots of eerie variations on death divination and second sight.  The planks used to make coffins seem to be especially prescient.<br />Definitely read &quot;Ghosts Spirits and Spectres of Scotland&quot; if you like frightening stories with a Gaelic twist.  There are enough ghostly pipers in this book to entertain even the most ardent admirer of Scottish lore.  One final quibble: I wish the author or publisher had mentioned the source of this book's illustrations, because they provide just the right atmosphere for the stories.  Haunting.  Very haunting.e stories.  Haunting.  Very haunting.	2001-03-10

Bruce Montgomery  (2) Michael Innes a.k.a. John Innes Mackintosh Stewart (3) Dorothy Sayers (4) Margery Allingham (5) Michael Innes a.k.a. John Innes Mackintosh Stewart (with a drop in rank for his mysteries that went off the surreal deep-end).<br />Out of my Fab Four Brits, Michael Innes and Edmund Crispin have the most in common.  They were both of Scots-Irish background, both wrote their mysteries under pseudonyms while teaching at college, and both were educated at Oxford -- Oriel College and St. John's College, respectively.  They both wrote highly literate mysteries with frequent allusions to the classics (nine out of ten of which go zooming right over my head).  Michael Innes has his detective, Sir John Appleby poke fun at this high-brow type of murder fiction in &quot;Death at the Chase&quot;:<br />&quot;That's why detective stories are of no interest to policemen. Their villains remain far too consistently cerebral.&quot;<br />Expect that even the most vicious murderer in an Edmund Crispin mystery will quote Dryden or Shakespeare at the drop of a garrote.  &quot;Frequent Hearses&quot; is a fertile setting for this type of classical badinage, since its plot involves the making of a film based on the biography of Alexander Pope.  Gervase Fen, Oxford don of English Language and Literature, and amateur detective extraordinaire is hired by the film company as a story consultant, and he is plagued throughout the book by a Scotland Yard detective who is an amateur classics scholar.  Fen wants to discuss the murder.  Chief Inspector Humbleby wants to talk about the Brontes and Dr. Johnson.  Neither man will admit to a less than perfect understanding of either his profession or his hobby, and both despise amateurs.  Their encounters keep &quot;Frequent Hearses&quot; sparkling along right up until its final page.  ...All of Crispin's characters are carefully (one might say 'crisply') developed, and distinguished for the reader by a quirk or eccentric manner of speech (sometimes Crispin overplays the eccentricity at the expense of realism, especially with his main protagonist-- I do wish Fen would stop expostulating, &quot;Oh, my fur and whiskers!&quot;).  Physical description is sketchy.  If one of Crispin's characters walked past you in the street, you probably wouldn't recognize him.  However, if you were to overhear his conversation with the postman---<br />And I don't mean to imply that &quot;Frequent Hearses&quot; is all dialogue and no action...<br />The mystery surrounding the murderer's identity and motivation is as cleverly convoluted as the maze, and it is equally as hard to get to its heart.  The author's red herrings are logically constructed and I always go snapping after them, even after a second or third reading... Crispin himself wrote and published at least one film script and composed music for several films, so &quot;Frequent Hearses&quot; is told with the knowledge of a movie industry insider...<br />If you like vintage British mysteries with a 'classical education' and haven't yet discovered the 'Professor Fen' novels, then you're in for a treat...  Here are all eleven of the Fen mysteries, in case you jump into 'Frequent Hearses' and want to keep going:<br />The Case of the Gilded Fly (1944),  Holy Disorder (1945),  The Moving Toyshop (1946),  Swan Song (1947),  Love Lies Bleeding (1948),  Buried for Pleasure (1948),  Frequent Hearses (1950),  The Long Divorce (1952),  Beware of the Trains (1953),  Glimpses of the Moon (1978),  Fen Country (1979) - short storiesntil its final page.  ...All of Crispin's characters are carefully (one might say 'crisply') developed, and distinguished for the reader by a quirk or eccentric manner of speech (sometimes Crispin overplays the eccentricity at the expense of realism, especially with his main protagonist-- I do wish Fen would stop expostulating, &quot;Oh, my fur and whiskers!&quot;).

I also read &quot;Maine Coon Cats&quot; by Carol Himsel Daly, and &quot;Guide to Owning a Maine Coon Cat&quot; by Abigail Greene (et al) and &quot;That Yankee Cat&quot; is by far the most interesting and the most specific to the breed.  The author, Marilis Hornidge even spends some print on the characteristics of Maine Coon owners (although, for some reason she leaves out the fact that we are all totally loveable):<br />&quot;Maine Coon people, more than any other group in the fancy, seem to enjoy word games in naming organizations, catteries, and their cats.&quot;<br />In Chapter 5, &quot;Tales of the Cat&quot;, Hornidge gives full rein to Maine Coon-related word play, although she doesn't explain why some owners chose the names they inflicted on these big, shaggy beauties, e.g. Captain Jenks of the Horse Marines, Absorbine Jr., Commodore Perry, and Surfer Dude.  ...<br />Breed characteristics are discussed in terms of 'boondocker paws', 'Elizabethan ruff',  'rectangularness', &quot;SMART, SMART, SMART (but not stuck up about it)&quot;, 'a dry sense of humor', and 'the Medium-sized Cat in the Large Fur Coat' - not quite CFA-standard language, but easy to visualize!  The photographs in this book demonstrate the great variety of the breed, not just your typical big, brown tabby.  There are pictures of red mackerel tabbies, cameo tabbies, and splotched tabbies, and even a Black Smoke and a 'tuxedo cat' or two.  I only wish more of the photographs could have been in color.  It's very difficult to distinguish a brown mackerel from a red mackerel in a black-and-white photograph.<br />The book also has clearly written sections on genetics and coat color, 'peaceful coexistence' (if you own any cat at all, you'll know what that means), grooming, and first-aid.<br />The author has even composed a sub-chapter called 'Pot Purry' which I will leave to your imagination.<br />And speaking of word games and Maine Coon owners, shouldn't a Maine Coon Cattery be called a 'Coonery'?<br />Read &quot;That Yankee Cat&quot; if you're even thinking about getting a kitten.  Or not.  It's a hundred-and-one pages of sheer delight for those of us who are actually lucky enough to be owned by one of these gentle, shaggy down-Easterners.n.<br />And speaking of word games and Maine Coon owners, shouldn't a Maine Coon Cattery be called a 'Coonery'?<br />Read &quot;That Yankee Cat&quot; if you're even thinking about getting a kitten.

Here is the beautiful princess, forced into a life as a scullery maid by a powerful mage, who also turns her father into a deadly were-stag with a &quot;black moon rising from his burning horns&quot;.  Here also is the mage-prince who eventually recognizes the princess for what she is in spite of her formidable disguise, and returns her to her loving mother.<br />The sleeping beauty on the Kinuko Craft cover may do justice to the loveliness of the princess-turned-scullery-maid (at least prior to her transformation by the mage), but it doesn't capture her incredible will to survive after she is torn from her parents and dumped, naked and alone, into an alien universe.  Yes, she ends up as a scullery maid, thought to be mute and retarded by her fellow kitchen workers.  Yes, she scrubs pots from dawn to midnight.  But the prince's kitchen turns out to be lively and warm, and filled with an eccentric hierarchy of cooks, sauce makers, plate washers, mincers, pluckers, boners, choppers, and spit-boys. McKillip goes into loving detail over the making and serving of food fit for a King's table, and when the princess Saro finally leaves the washing cauldron to fulfill her destiny, I for one felt a faint tinge of regret.<br />Who would have thought that a medieval kitchen could be a more interesting place to linger than a fairy forest where &quot;water flowed, silver and sweet as honey among ancient roots&quot;?<br />&quot;The Book of Atrix Wolfe&quot; stands many fairy tale truisms on their heads, including the character of the evil, all-powerful mage.  In this story, the mage Atrix Wolfe creates the deadly Hunter that almost destroys the prince's family, but he does so with the intention of stopping a war.  The Hunter himself is Death, but even he is not precisely evil.

It is about a girl who wants to be 'normal' and who tries to reject her creative, wild-woman self - the self who writes 30-page fairy tales about The Stagman when she should be studying algebra.<br />Tame Frances and Wild Frances grow to adulthood through the fifties and sixties.  She (they) endure a very dislocated existence as the Army posts her(their)father to Arizona, Germany, England, and finally California. Tame Frances fears and is drawn to horned, pronged, pointed objects -- cactii are an underground Hellgiant's fingers; tusked boars haunt the German forest -- and finally her more creative self invents The Stagman, after a close encounter with a Guy Fawkes effigy.  The Stagman haunts the rest of the book.  He is the culmination of everything Tame Frances fears and desires.  This is very much an internal rather than an external fantasy, so there are no magic spells or incantations to make the Stagman go away.  Frances slowly grows together, stops disliking herself, loses a bit of her shyness, stops running away from her creative self, and comes to terms with the Stagman and (maybe) the Buttercup God.<br />This is how a very creative writer grows up, beautifully told.	2001-03-04

When he was born at ten minutes after midnight, March 30, 1970, his owner took one look at him and said, &quot;There is a whopper.&quot;  His own firstborn was an Appaloosa colt named 'First Secretary'.  Another son - a draft horse cross - is still alive and well and recently retired from the Southwest dressage circuit.  Yet a third son won the Belmont by a margin of 21 lengths, in what was the second fastest running and third largest margin in history.<br />Of course, his Daddy still holds the record for both margin and time.<br />And who is Risen Star's Daddy?<br />Secretariat, of course.  No one who admires this special breed of horse could possibly have flunked this quiz.<br />When we watched Big Red hit the wire 31 lengths ahead of Twice a Prince in 1973, crushing the Belmont stakes record by two seconds and change, many of us knew that we would not see his like again.  According to his jockey, Ron Turcotte, Secretariat was retired before he had reached his full potential at the longer distances.  We would have loved to watch that big red horse run all day and smash every record there was, but it was not to be.<br />At any rate, reading William Nack's, &quot;Secretariat: The Making of a Champion&quot; is the next best thing to watching him run (unless you are lucky enough and rich enough to own one of his 'blue hen' daughters).  At least his fans can relive the races Big Red did run, and Nack has the knack (sorry) of bringing them vividly back to memory.  This book and &quot;Wild Ride: The Rise and Tragic Fall of Calumet Farm, Inc., America's Premier Racing Dynasty&quot; by Ann Hagedorn Auerbach are my two favorite reads on all aspects of the Thoroughbred racing industry in the United States.  &quot;Secretariat&quot; reflects the brilliance of the Thoroughbred and its human interface.  &quot;Wild Ride&quot; reflects the dark side of that same relationship.<br />My only complaint regarding Nack's treatment of Secretariat is that although it starts in the right place (the birth of Somethingroyal's whopping, chestnut foal), it didn't extend much beyond Big Red's last race.  I would have liked to follow him through at least part of his career at stud.<br />However, that might be asking too much of a book that was published only two years after this great Thoroughbred retired from the track.<br />At the beginning of the new millennium, Man O'War was voted 'Thoroughbred of the Century' by a panel that was assembled by 'Blood Horse' Magazine.  But those of us who saw Secretariat win the Belmont will remember him as first, and (as they said about one of his most famous ancestors) the rest nowhere.Ride&quot; reflects the dark side of that same relationship.<br />My only complaint regarding Nack's treatment of Secretariat is that although it starts in the right place (the birth of Somethingroyal's whopping, chestnut foal), it didn't extend much beyond Big Red's last race.

I can't imagine Dr. Zinsser's grumpily discursive, masterfully written, and ultimately profound biography of typhus fever ever going completely out of print. Stylistically the only work I can compare it to is Gibbon's &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;.  Where Gibbon occasionally dipped his pen in vinegar and excoriated the Christians, Zinsser dips his pen in hydrochloric acid and savages all of the quaint human customs that have kept Typhus alive and thriving.  He shows much more affectionate sympathy for the louse than he does for the General or the Politician.  Witness:<br />&quot;The louse shares with us the misfortune of being prey to the typhus virus.  If lice can dread, the nightmare of their lives is the fear of some day inhabiting an infected rat or human being.  For the host may survive; but the ill-starred louse that sticks his haustellum through an infected skin, and imbibes the loathsome virus with his nourishment, is doomed beyond succor.  In eight days he sickens, in ten days he is 'in extremis', on the eleventh or twelfth his tiny body turns red with blood extravasated from his bowel, and he gives up his little ghost.&quot;<br />In the interests of research, Zinsser carried pill boxes of lice under his socks for weeks at a time before taking &quot;advantage of them for scientific purposes.&quot;  He is not able to tear himself away from these little creatures and address the true subject of his biography, i.e. the typhus virus, until Chapter 12!<br />However, the journey to Chapter 12 is well worth taking because along the way, Zinsser wittily savages modern biographers, psychoanalysis, astronomers and physicists who &quot;scamper back to God&quot; (Biologists evidently are much less prone to being 'born again'), and of course, all of the wars that have given Typhus countless opportunities to murder lice and humans alike.<br />&quot;Rats, Lice, and History&quot; should be required reading for would-be writers for its style, would-be Generals for its lessons on how soldiers really die, and for anyone else who is interested in a passionate, eminently witty, one-of-a-kind history of medicine.pportunities to murder lice and humans alike.<br />&quot;Rats, Lice, and History&quot; should be required reading for would-be writers for its style, would-be Generals for its lessons on how soldiers really die, and for anyone else who is interested in a passionate, eminently witty, one-of-a-kind history of medicine.	2001-02-27

It is chronicle of hatred, prophecy, and a very, very conservative religious elite who govern through magic (the Domain of the Mind)and forbid any kind of mechanical innovation (the Domain of the Hand).  The 'Stone' of the title is the magical equivalent of a fragment of the True Cross. A millennium before this novel begins, the Stone was stolen from its loving and noble caretakers who are hunted to extermination over the years.  As you begin to read, the Stone's true caretakers are reduced to a single family, and ultimately, to a single boy. How he seeks to recover the Stone and wreak vengence on those who stole it is the heart of the story.<br />Now the bad news:  reading this book was a lot like being a spectator at a chess match.  If the cold, logical intricacies of the religion that play out through this book are of interest to you, you won't mind sitting still until the end game.  The story's climax is certainly worth the wait.<br />However, if you're like me you'll put &quot;The Arm of the Stone&quot; aside, maybe for a week at a time, and look for something a bit more frivolous.  I read all ten of Roger Zelazny's Amber novels (&quot;The Great Book of Amber&quot;) before I picked up &quot;The Arm of the Stone&quot; and finished it.<br />The contrast between Zelazny's Amber and the grim, cold world of the Stone is like the difference between winning a vacation to Venusburg, or spending an eon in the refrigerated compartment of Purgatory.  Zelazny's plots skip forward, driven by his wise-cracking, laid-back characters, while &quot;Arm of the Stone&quot; inches forward with all of the grim momentum of a glacier.<br />All religious quibbles aside though, I'm ordering the sequel, &quot;Garden of the Stone&quot;.  I really did come to care about the Stone's two main characters, chess pieces though they were.  And it's hard to find fantasy as original, and intricately plotted, and well-written as was &quot;The Arm of the Stone.&quot;<br />Read it out of duty, if not for fun.ere.

This book is organized like a field guide to birds, but instead of browsing through a description of the shy and spritely wren and its habitat, you will read about the not-so-shy and spritely 'Candida albicans', its description and habitat (the human mouth, baby bottoms, etc.).  In fact it is in the 'Candida albicans' section where Wayne Biddle maintains that, &quot;even the most squeaky-clean aesthete has a lot in common with rotten tree trunks.&quot;<br />The essays are in alphabetical order, so yeasts are jumbled together with other fungi, viruses, and bacteria.  You may be able to read some of essays with a superior smirk on your face (&quot;I don't think I have to worry about catching chikungunya or o'nyong-nyong.&quot;).  This inevitably sets you up for a bruising in a following essay, in this case the &quot;Chinese Restaurant Syndrome.&quot;<br />Did you ever wonder where monosodium glutamate, aka MSG comes from?  According to Biddle, this Chinese restaurant stalwart is a byproduct  of 'corynebacterium glutamicum', a kissing cousin of the diptheria germ.<br />Let's hope you don't find a mutated version in your egg foo yung!<br />&quot;A Field Guide to Germs&quot; is very funny and easy to read - the very antithesis of a textbook - but it is not recommended for the weak-of-stomach or the hypochondriac.	2001-02-25

Parts of his Amber novels were serialized in the SF/Fantasy magazines of the 1970s, and it shows in his adventure-a-minute, cliff-hanging writing style.  I also understand that DC Comics was going to do a series on Amber, and I think that would work, too, because Zelazny's writing is very visual, character-driven, and episodic in nature.  He was one of the great fantasy writers of the last four decades, and he collected the hardware to prove it: six Hugos; two Locus Poll awards; three Nebulas; one Apollo; and two Balrog trophies.  I originally read each of his Amber novels as they were published, and having all of the stories collected into one volume certainly makes it easier to keep track of the machinations and counter-plots and vendettas of Amber's homicidal First Family.<br />The Amber novels start out as a chronicle of a royal family feud as narrated by Corwin, son of King Oberon and presumptive heir to the throne of Amber (if his immortal father should ever die).  Corwin has spent the last three hundred years on Earth (which is a mere shadow of the one real world of Amber) in a state of amnesia,  courtesy of one of his eight scheming siblings.  He manages to survive the Great Plague of London, numerous wars, and an addiction to chain-smoking before his would-be murderer shifts through the shadows from Amber to Earth and tries to kill him again, this time via an automobile accident.  Corwin survives the car crash and starts to regain his memory of who and what he is. His return to Amber and the search for his would-be assassin drives the plot from &quot;Nine Princes in Amber&quot; through &quot;The Courts of Chaos&quot;.  Then, after five books, Corwin's son Merlin takes over the narrative.<br />Whereas Corwin was a hard-boiled, wise-cracking 40's kind of guy who was irresistible to women and possessed supernormal physical prowess, his son Merlin is a kinder, gentler 60's kind of guy who is irresistible to women and possesses supernormal physical prowess.  He doesn't fight nearly as many duels or kill nearly as many folks as his father did.  Zelazny's Royal Amberites are affable, interesting, and even noble at times.  However, they are supermen so don't expect too much in the way of character development.  The women are especially two-dimensional: beautiful and ineffectual, for the most part although they do evolve into something a bit more interesting as the series continues.<br />The real reason to read &quot;The Great Book of Amber&quot; is the journey through the parallel worlds of Shadow.  The notion of shifting to a slightly different reality as you walk or drive or ride is endlessly fascinating.  Zelazny is at his most lyrical as the shadow of a tree turns from black to emerald or another sun appears in the sky.  When travelling through Shadow with him, it is hard for me to remember whether I'm awake and reading, or asleep and dreaming of an effortless, exotic, changing reality.<br />If Coleridge took opium to dream of Xanadu, what did Zelazny take to dream of Amber?<br />You really ought to journey through Shadow with this fine author at least once in your life.tible to women and possessed supernormal physical prowess, his son Merlin is a kinder, gentler 60's kind of guy who is irresistible to women and possesses supernormal physical prowess.

The first two, &quot;The<br />Talisman&quot; and &quot;A Shadow on the Wall&quot; were more tightly<br />plotted and ultimately more satisfying and frightening.  &quot;The<br />Matrix&quot; seems to wander through a series of horror story<br />set-pieces, e.g. the claw marks on the apartment door, the violation<br />of Catriona's grave, the sucker marks on the hero's body, without<br />really connecting them together in a way that satisfies and makes<br />sense. A new character, Father Silvestri, pops up toward the end of<br />the novel and juggles our hero out of the fire a la Dr. Van<br />Helsing in a Dracula novel. Then he dies, and we never really learn<br />what group he belonged to or why he was trying to save Andrew from the<br />Necromancer. Yet another new character, an evil book seller is<br />threaded into and out of the story's climax without really helping to<br />wrap up the plot.  It made me wonder if &quot;The Matrix&quot; had a<br />precursor or a sequel where some of these seemingly extraneous<br />characters are introduced in more detail.<br />At any rate, Aycliffe<br />still manages to write a horrifying although rather discombobulated<br />story about a young, recently widowed doctoral student who is slowly<br />drawn into the web of an evil Necromancer.  There are some nice Gaelic<br />touches, brooding Scottish scenery, and a pilgrimage to the stifling,<br />ancient landscapes of Morocco.  I'm in violent agreement with the<br />other reviewers in that this author should be much more visible on the<br />bookshelves.  He writes a more frightening story than any of the<br />authors in the Buckets o'Blood school of horror fiction.<br />However,<br />I'm glad my introduction to Jonathan Aycliffe was through &quot;The<br />Talisman&quot; and &quot;A Shadow on the Wall&quot;.  &quot;The<br />Matrix&quot; unravelled into too many loose ends: Why were those<br />flapping, tentacled thingies in the Andrew's attic?  How did they get<br />there?  Who was the baby in the coffin with Catriona?  What purpose<br />did it serve?  Where did Father Silvestri learn about the Necromancer?<br />How did he die?  Why did he show up so late in the plot?th Catriona?  What purpose did it serve?  Where did Father Silvestri learn about the Necromancer? How did he die?

In &quot;A Shadow on the Wall&quot;, mysterious scripture appears on a tombstone ('He shall return out of the dark').  An Anglican priest attempts to renovate a church deep in the East Anglican fens.  A late-Victorian, Cambridge don is drawn into the mystery of the priest's death.  This is M.R. James country, with its spectres seen through a shroud, darkly, and its hero, an unworldly scholar.  If you prefer a shock-a-minute, buckets o'blood approach to horror, Aycliffe is probably not for you.  If your imagination is your own worst enemy and all you require is a misplaced shadow or a scratching in the attic to keep you awake through the dark hours, read &quot;A Shadow on the Wall&quot; or Aycliffe's &quot;The Talisman&quot;.  This is the English, Jamesian school of horror at its best.	2001-02-20

Some of the stories are told in dialect, which may add flavor for some of us while sending others back to the bookcase for easier bedtime reading.  They should persevere though, for one of the stories, &quot;Wandering Willie's Tale&quot; by Sir Walter Scott is especially fiendish.<br />A couple of the stories, &quot;The Horns of the Bull&quot; and &quot;Shona and the Water Horse&quot; are more fantastic than horrible.  Many more are decidedly gruesome - you might be able to hold down a story or two at bedtime, but I wouldn't recommend reading some of them at the dinner table, especially not &quot;Brown God in the Beginning&quot; or &quot;Sawney Bean and his Family&quot;.  This book will definitely give you a flavour of Scotland that is not to be found in the tour guides.<br />All of the &quot;Scottish Tales of Terror&quot; are well-written and well (although fiendishly) chosen.  Some of them are definitely not for the weak of stomach.  The editor, Angus Campbell, describes one story, &quot;The Brownie of the Black Haggs&quot; as &quot;seasoned with mystery, flavoured by terror, it is a fitting dessert to a gruesome feast.&quot;<br />A gruesome, Scottish feast, indeed.	2001-02-20

The author himself says, &quot;I am a sceptic in most things - in the behavior of the living as much as that of the dead - and so I am inclined to believe some of the stories gathered here more than others.&quot;<br />Scottish history with its bloody battles, betrayals, and persecutions lends itself peculiarly well to tales of ghostly vengeance.  Several stories in this book describe revenants that arose from the persecutions of the Covenanters, the witches, the Royalists, and the Catholics (depending on who was in power).  Glamis Castle gets its own chapter, and haunted lochs and beaches  also have their stories told.  Some of the scariest hauntings are drowned sailors returned from the sea, and some of the least scary involve Baby Boomer types who treat their ghosts like pets or something deserving of pity.  It was enough to make me wish that the smug New Agers would some day have to go a round with 'the Deil of Littledean' or the 'Beast of Glamis'.<br />The author also makes room for several eerie tales of Gaelic 'second sight'.  Scots with this 'gift' seem particularly prone to seeing ghostly funeral processions, sometimes with themselves as part of the funeral cortege!<br />All in all, &quot;Scottish Ghost Stories&quot; is a worthwhile read for those of you who collect tales of 'true' hauntings.	2001-02-14

Throughout the twentieth century and into the new millenium, we've given our microscopic enemies glorious new opportunities to exploit us, whether it be through war, slash-and-burn agriculture, or stagnant water in an air-conditioning system. Laurie Garrett has written a fascinating and frightening account of some of the battles we almost won (measles and polio) and some where we appear to be in full retreat (AIDS, drug-resistant tuberculosis).  Her book is especially compulsive reading when she describes the individual skirmishes in the war, e.g. a journey into the African bush to identify and treat a disease that was killing 80% of its victims, or the discovery that cholera vibrio could live inside of algae and didn't require person-to-person transmission.<br />Even if you live in the middle of the Canadian tundra and have sworn off eating mollusks for the rest of your life, this book hammers home the fact that you're still not safe from what used to be called 'Third World diseases'.  Even as I write this review, there is a woman in an isolation chamber of a hospital in Hampton, Ontario who is gravely ill with an unknown hemorrhagic fever.  The doctors don't think its Ebola Fever, but they're not sure what it is, or whether any of the other passengers on the plane from Nigeria to Canada could also have been infected.<br />You can conclude (as I did) from &quot;The Coming Plague&quot; that many of us who expected to die from age-related conditions such as heart failure or cancer, may now well perish from infection.  This book manages to combine the heroics of &quot;Men against Death&quot;, the grim prophecy of &quot;Silent Spring&quot;, and descriptions of several hair-raising, near-tragedies akin to the &quot;Hot Zone&quot;.  I highly recommend it.	2001-02-10

It has been 'personalized' by inserting the breed name 'Maine Coon' into the title and various other places in the text.  Most of text is about cats in general, but all of the book's photographs display big, fuzzy Maine Coons.  And there are some specifics about this very special breed - the cost of a show kitten vs. 'just a pet', a short history of the breed, etc.  We own a small Maine Coon cattery ('JustThisOnce' Cattery) with five current residents (if you don't count the humans).  For a more specific book on this native American breed, I'd recommend &quot;This is the Maine Coon Cat&quot; by Sharyn P. Bass.  The photographs are mainly black and white (and grainy), but the text is much more specific to Coonies, especially if you plan to show.  I learned from Bass's book that our Maine Coons aren't unique in the way they scoop water out of their dish with a big, hairy paw and then drink it.  Evidently, this is one of the breed traits that got Maine Coons mistaken for raccoons in the first place!<br />I don't want to turn you away from Barron's &quot;Maine Coon Cats - A Complete Owners Manual&quot;.  It contains very good generic information about raising cats, and the photographs are really lovely.  It just has that 'mass produced' feel about it.	2001-02-08

Whether he's a physician or not, Miller tells a heck of a good story.  Each one of his sixteen stories was solved through forensic detection, and the author has chosen incidents that are well off the radar of most true crime writers.  Many of the murderers are women, and the final murderess in &quot;What the Corpse Revealed&quot; chooses a very unique method of killing herself while in prison.  In fact, it's a very unique book through and through -- those British really know how to tell a 'good' murder story.  Try this book, and then read &quot;Forty Years of Murder&quot; by Keith Simpson, if you won't take my word for it.<br />If you like true-crime stories with a scientific framework, or if you are a fan of well-told, suspenseful detective tales, &quot;What the Corpse Revealed&quot; will keep you reading well into night.

If I've just finished watching my &quot;La Forza del Destino&quot; video with Corelli and Tebaldi, I prefer the more passionate and serious prose of Peter Conrad's, &quot;A Song of Love and Death&quot;.  However, if I've just returned from a Michigan Opera Theatre production where a mylar balloon floated down from the wings and bobbed up and down next to Aida as she and Radames was expiring very musically in their tomb, then my book of choice would be &quot;Skeletons from the Opera Closet.&quot;  It is an extremely funny, editorialized history of opera, even though it leaves most of Opera's favorite sight gags (e.g. Tosca and the trampoline)to Vickers' &quot;Operatic Disasters&quot; and &quot;More Operatic Disasters&quot;. My favorite chapter is, &quot;Having an Acts to Grind&quot; where the authors discuss their least favorite acts in some very well known operas.  They set the scene thusly:<br />&quot;You rush off into the rain, there are no cabs, your dinner consists of a cup of cardboard coffee and a $4.00 box of stale mints at the theater, and the 'fun little opera' turns into a Germanic five-act cement dumpling, set in what appears to be outer space, and sung by the fattest cast this side of Barnum and Bailey.&quot;<br />Groover and Conner's choices for 'cement dumplings' are wickedly funny (and not all of them are Germanic).<br />This book's mixture of operatic history, gossip, and anecdotes is very easy to digest--the very antithesis of a cement dumpling.  I enjoyed it from beginning (&quot;How to Build a Chinese Opera House&quot;) to end (&quot;Curtain Call&quot;), incidentally learning along the way that it was Beethoven who wrote the opera where (almost) no one came to the premiere.  The Viennese loved their music but they were about to be overrun by Napoleon's Grand Army, and so they did the only practical thing.  They deserted.<br />Maybe Beethoven should have named his opera, &quot;Infidelio&quot;.erted.<br />Maybe Beethoven should have named his opera, &quot;Infidelio&quot;.	2001-01-28

Each setting, each character is illuminated with clear description and color, like scenes from a medieval Book of Hours.  Even though I first read this book in 1965, I can still close my eyes and see Gillan and the ancient Dame Alousan gathering herbs in the high-walled garden of Norstead Abbey.  I can see the twelve and one high-born maids riding forth from the Abbey - the twelve and one maids who were promised as brides to the Were-riders of the Waste....<br />&quot;Year of the Unicorn&quot; is a grand adventure, a love story, a coming-of-age novel set like a jewel amidst the fantastical Dark and Light of Norton's Witch World. 'Unicorn' veers away from the 'mainstream' WW adventures of the Tregarth family (&quot;Witch World&quot;, &quot;Web of the Witch World&quot;, &quot;Three Against the Witch World&quot;, etc.), but it is perfect in its own setting (the Wastes and Dales of High Hallack), and in its own right.

Just when the reader feels that the unlucky inheritor of Lovecraft's mansion has suffered enough, something worse happens to him.  &quot;The Judge's House&quot; by Bram Stoker (rats figure prominently in this story, too) is another mouldy oldie but goodie.  It has always reminded me of J. Sheridan Le Fanu's &quot;An Account of Some Strange Disturbances in Aungier Street&quot;, although I think Le Fanu's story is the scarier of the two.<br />There are also some good not-so-collected stories by Ruth Rendell and Joyce Carol Oates, among others.  My favorite is &quot;The Tearing of Greymare House&quot; by Michael Reeves. It piles on so much horror that I had to put the story down for awhile before I could read to the end.  I think Reeves 'out-Kings' Stephen King in this last selection of the book.  Kudos to Martin H. Greenberg for searching out good haunted house stories that haven't yet been over-collected.	2001-01-24

This book, which was recommended to me by one of the senior DBAs, did a good job with &quot;Tips for Semi-Technical Managers and Supervisors&quot; (my own background is in application development).  It was very easy for me to find information on which recovery options make sense for the various customer up-time requirements (and how expensive each one is), how to manage space and growth (and what to do if your customer really, really underestimates the amount of table space needed), which standby options make sense, when to use advanced replication, etc.<br />In fact, this book paid for itself when one of our (internal)customers decided to go with asynchronous replication for the Oracle data bases that support 24x7 access to our nuclear generation plant, and we had to very quickly come up-to-speed on how to implement AR.<br />The final chapter in &quot;Oracle 24x7 Tips &amp; Techniques&quot; talks about the high availibility features that are available with Oracle8i, for those of you who are looking at 8i or have already converted over to it.	2001-01-22

In his introduction to this book, Aycliffe assures us that, &quot;The Babylonian bits(for the most part) are accurate, as are the Arabic and Persian references.  I share with (M.R.) James the tendency to give in to temptation and provide my readers with authentic incantations and and historic personages.&quot;<br />For this reader, at least, the author's authenticity is what made &quot;The Talisman&quot; so fascinating and frightening.  The ancient Babylonian demon Shabbatil is made to come alive (or was it ever dead?) through a combination of archeology and evil intent.  The resulting plagues of blindness and demonic children form a mystery that is slowly unravelled by Tom, a museum curator and his wife Nicola, a doctoral student.  Their son, Adam is one of first children to fall under the influence of Shabbatil.  &quot;The Talisman&quot; builds to a horrifying crescendo of evil, and its end is not a tidy gathering-in of loose ends.  As the protagonist comments in the final pages, &quot;The past is not dead, it merely sleeps.&quot;<br />Incidentally, Jason C. Eckhardt is the illustrator of &quot;The Talisman&quot;, not its co-author.	2001-01-15

James and &quot;The Whistling Room&quot; by William Hope Hodgson.  He also included stories that have never (to my knowledge) been included in an anthology--and for a good reason.  They usually weren't worth reading (at least, if you're looking for a good scare).  There were also too many humorous ghost stories for my taste -- authors always seem to come off as over-arch and coy when they strain for levity in a ghost story.<br />I'd recommend &quot;Haunted Houses - The Greatest Stories&quot; which was edited by Martin H. Greenburg over this collection of Peter Haining's.  Haining seemed to be straining for 'mammoth' rather than for 'haunted'.	2001-01-14

As the author says in her introduction, &quot;It's a simple matter to throw two cats together and hope for the best.  But somewhere down the road, disaster and disappointment await the person who believes that 'nature' will take care of everything.&quot;<br />In the exclusive world of the Cat Fancy, it's not even a simple matter to 'throw two cats together'.  Everything has to be arranged for in advance (most catteries won't allow their males to breed an unknown female, even one with papers, because of the chance of disease).  At any rate, suppose you earn the trust of a cattery owner, or purchase your own male.  Then what?  Your queen is pregnant.  What should you do to ensure that she gives birth to and raises a healthy litter?<br />This is when &quot;Breeding Purebred Cats&quot; will become indispensible.  The author explains in clear, succinct terms how the queen should be handled, how to determine whether she is indeed pregnant, how to figure out when she's going to give birth, how to assist at the kittening, and when to call for help. And &quot;Breeding Purebred Cats&quot; isn't just about breeding and giving birth.  It covers all aspects of breeding practices, raising kittens and selling them, and cattery management.  We found Anne S. Moore's book essential for the proper care and upbringing of a healthy litter of Maine Coons.	2001-01-07

I bought a copy for a friend and now I can't bear to give it up.  It has everything for the rosarian:  thousands of enticing color photographs and descriptions (the author's own collection of roses numbers well over 2,000 species and varieties); extensive chapters on using roses in the landscape (even if your 'landscape' happens to be an apartment terrace), the care and cultivation of roses, the history of roses; and at the back of the encyclopediac text, there are extensive appendixes, indices, a glossary of terms, and suggestions for further reading.<br />Peter Beales is also a pleasure to read--very British; very knowledgeable; and it is very obvious that he loves his subject. I have only two minor suggestions for &quot;Classic Roses&quot; if it is once again revised:  include U.S.A. climate zones for the roses; include photographs of all (not most) of the roses (I'll bet the author wanted to do this and the publishers wouldn't let him).<br />As fond as I am of my friend, &quot;Classic Roses&quot; and I are never going to part company.	2000-12-30

If it were fiction, &quot;Night&quot; might be classified as a work 'magical realism'.  Since it is non-fiction, the best classification I can come up with is 'dream-state realism'.  The publishers of &quot;Night&quot; threw up their metaphorical hands and classified it as 'psychology'.<br />The photographs and paintings that Alvarez chose to accompany his text are particularly haunting.  One in particular: an untitled photograph by Roger Parry shows a dark room with a dull beam of light streaming in through a half-opened door.  The photograph was taken from inside the room and a few objects can be dimly seen: a daguerrotype propped upside-down against the dark wainscoting; a length of rope that might be fastened into a noose.  Alvarez has this to say about the photograph:  &quot;I no longer remember how I populated the darkness, but I remember the fear itself, particularly of the darkness that shrouded the upper floor, where I slept.&quot;<br />In turn, he caused me to remember the upper room in my grandparents' house where I used to sleep.  The light-switch was behind the door and next to a closet.  I had to go into the dark behind the door to turn on the light, and as I did so, the closet door would seem to swing open---<br />Read &quot;Night&quot; and see what memories return to haunt you.	2000-12-28

Thanks to previous Amazon.com reviewers for introducing me to &quot;Obernewtyn&quot;.  The story of Elspeth Gordie and her struggle to pass as 'normal' in her grim, post-Holocaust world reminded me more of &quot;Watership Down&quot; than of Andre Norton's fantasies (a comparison made by a previous reviewer), since the animal characters seemed much wiser and more likeable than most of the humans!<br />As Elspeth learns how to use her telepathic powers, she is aided by a motley crew of friends, including a dog and a spastic cat named Maruman who plays the role of a half-mad prophet.  The animals recognize her as the 'One who will fulfill The Prophecy', and save the Earth from a second Holocaust.  Unfortunately, Elspeth must contend with those who seek to discover and control the apocalyptic weapon that almost destroyed their ancestors.<br />&quot;Obernewtyn&quot; drew me right in and kept me reading through the night to see whether Elspeth could survive and somehow manage to use her special talent to save herself and her friends from some really nasty villains.  I'm looking forward to the sequel, where (hopefully) Maruman the mad feline prophet has a further role to play.<br />I withheld one star only because some aspects of Elspeth's telepathic powers seemed to pop up for the sake of moving the plot forward, e.g. the ability to pick locks.  A minor nit, but it took me out of the story for a minute to puzzle over why picking locks (action against a physical entity) had anything to do with reading people's minds.	2000-12-27

The only book I can compare it to is Mary Renault's classic, &#34;The Persian Boy&#34; which is the story of Alexander the Great as narrated by his slave, Bagoas.  Now, imagine Bagoas as transformed into the slave, Seyonne who was once a mighty wizard and Warden against demonkind.  The 'Alexander the Great' character is Prince Aleksander who is heir-apparent to an Empire that could have been founded by Harun al-Rashid, and Berg's mixture of 'Arabian Nights', demons, and wizardry is darn-near perfect.<br /><br />&#34;Transformation&#34; develops logically from the growth and interaction of its two main characters, Aleksander and Seyonne, but I wasn't noticing reviewerly items like 'character development' while I was reading it.  Berg has crafted such an interesting world that I was reading purely to see what happened next.  Magic flowed believably from character, which is the hallmark of a really good fantasy, and &#34;Transformation&#34; is one of the best I've read in a long time.  A wonderful, wizardly love story is revealed as an integral part of plot, as the reader gradually learns more about the Wardens and their struggle to protect humanity from demonkind.<br /><br />&#34;Transformation&#34; was published in August, 2000 and I can only hope that the author is hard at work on another, equally engrossing fantasy.	2000-12-27

Each breed is lovingly described with a short history, a conformation and color section, and a paragraph of 'interesting facts'.

So, when I bought &quot;Dave Barry is not Taking This Sitting Down&quot; for my sister's Christmas present, I decided she wouldn't mind if I did a bit of catching up on my favorite humor columnist.<br />That was a mistake.<br />I took it to bed with me and laughed so long and hard, the cats refused to come into the bedroom.  And THEN I got to the column he did on SUVs.  That's when I laughed myself into an earache.  How many of you out there drive one of those big honker Chevrolet Subdivisions (as Dave has rechristened them)?  You ought to be ashamed of yourselves, and you will be after you read this book---if you don't die laughing, first.  I can't wait until Dave Barry comes out with the ultimate tome on Southern Florida voting customs.<br />Now my husband wants to read &quot;Dave Barry Is Not Taking This Sitting Down&quot; before I wrap it up for my sister.  After all, he had to spend a sleepless night listening to me read it.	2000-12-14

The is the first forensic science book I've read where there was actually a photograph of the aftermath of one of the 'Jack the Ripper' murders.  David Owen has still assembled an interesting book.  Some of the forty crimes that he uses as examples are well-known, e.g. Wayne Williams, the Atlanta child killer.  Others will probably be unknown to the reader (Americans, at least).  For instance, there are several gruesome goings-on Down Under that the author touches on, including the sixty-three-year-old auntie who liked to put thallium in her relatives' tea.<br />Although &quot;Hidden Evidence&quot; held my interest, I wish the author had gone into more detail about the forensic techniques that he describes and also more detail about some of the crimes.  He skips from case to case so quickly that there is little room for suspense or a clear description of the amount of work it took to solve some of these crimes.  I think the British have the edge over us Americans when it comes to writing true crime/forensic science books.  One of my favorites is &quot;Forty Years of Murder&quot; by Professor Keith Simpson, who was the British Home Office pathologist for forty years.  Another favorite is the biography of  Bernard Spillsbury, who was Simpson's chief crime-solving rival.	2000-12-08

Lamashtu, the ancient Mesopotamian lion-headed goddess is conjured from hell to spread plague on the subways of New York.  Denise, the curator and Ilaron Highborn, the dark elf must band together stop her.  So far, so good.  But another evil dark elf is mixed into the plot, and he and Ilaron duel to the death one dark and stormy night in the Museum.  I was disappointed when the author didn't make more use of the Mesopotamian wing of the Museum, with its gigantic winged bulls.  For some reason, the duel is fought in the American wing, and then Ilaron and Denise confront Lamashtu on the Museum roof.  Yet another demon-god is conjured up to do battle with Lamashtu (talk about 'deus ex machina').  I just felt the author could have stuck with the Sumerian-Akkadian-Babylonian mythology cycle and written a much better, more consistent novel.	2000-12-04

However, this book turned out to be vintage Norton.  Not one, but two feisty heroines:  a middle-aged herbalist and her apprentice combat an ancient evil, newly sprung to life.<br />When at the top of her form, this author magically transports her reader right into her fantasy world.  This is one of Norton's books where I can actually see, taste, and feel through the senses of the heroine, who starts out as an abused scullery maid and ends up (through her own talent and courage) as a savior of the kingdom.  If you liked Norton's Witch World books, 'Scent of Magic' is definitely for you.	2000-12-02

She finds 'mana' (or 'ller' as it is called in this book) everywhere, and comes from a world where the king reigns for a single year and is then killed and eaten by his successor.  Her planet is invaded and she escapes to a world where magic is viewed as a power that can only be controlled by a few (male) mages.  It makes for a wonderful conflict between the heroine, Lisane and the male mages and wannabe mages who feel an obligation to 'train' her.  Once I started reading &quot;Nameless Magery&quot; I couldn't put it down, and read through to the end.  I hope there is a sequel for Turner's idiosyncratic, uninhibited, and squabbling magicians to once again display their very special magic.

It's all so unimaginative, compared to what he thinks is really going to happen. Kurzweil's predictions for ten, twenty, and a hundred years into our future, if true, imply that the last generation of 'true' humans (MOSHs he calls us)is already walking on Earth.  If he's right (and he's been right about a lot of things - M.I.T. named him the Inventor of the Year in 1988) and if I can hang on for another twenty years, I may never have to die.<br />What's really scary about reading this book is that some of the things Kurzweil predicted while writing it in 1998 have already come true - ahead of his schedule - e.g. the deciphering of the human genome.  And although he tries to be optimistic, he also appears to be very worried about our future on a world populated by bio-engineered viruses and rogue, self-replicating nanobots.<br />If you're a poet or would like to test yourself to see if you can distinguish poetry written by a human from poetry written by a computer, be sure to visit Kurzweil's website [online].  Take his poetry 'Turing test' and download his free Cybernetic Poet software.<br />Be sure to read this book, too.  It will help prepare you for your very interesting post-MOSH future.	2000-11-09

However, things get much worse for Jenny and her bespectacled husband, Lord John in &quot;Knight of the Demon Queen&quot;.  The book opens with their son's attempted suicide.  Lord John's people begin to die from a demon-caused plague...and the situation deteriorates from there.  Lord John goes hunting for a demon on a world that resembles a half-drowned, New York City of the near future.  His only allies are wired-in, wannabe wizards in a world of violent gangs, bad smells, and screaming, in-your-face-24-hours-a-day drug ads.<br />Ugh.  Get me out of this world, and don't send me back!<br />Jenny spends her part of the novel trying to come to grips with her loss of magic.  At least she gets to hang around with a dragon.<br />At any rate, Hambly leaves us hanging at the end of &quot;Knight of the Demon Queen&quot;.  We don't know whether Jenny and Lord John are alive or dead.  They seemed to have jumped from Purgatory straight into Hell. And here I am, still waiting for a reasonably happy ending.

The grim reaper in this tale is a pathetic old man with a Song that can seal the souls of the dead back inside their decaying bodies.<br />Tanya Huff sets &quot;Fifth Quarter&quot; in the same world as &quot;Sing the Four Quarters&quot;.  There are Bards who can Sing to the 'kigh', the elemental spirits of earth, air, fire, and water.  The Empire and its armies are major elements in the plot.  However, &quot;Fifth Quarter&quot; is not a continuation of the earlier book.  It is the story of  brother and sister assassins, who end up inhabiting the same body (the sister's) when they attempt to kill a man who has discovered the secret of eternal life.  How the brother gets his body back is one of the book's dominant plot lines, along with the hunt for the grim reaper, who has abducted the Emperor's son.<br />I didn't enjoy &quot;Fifth Quarter&quot; as much as Huff's earlier book.  It dwells too much on incest and decaying bodies.  However, it is a strong, well-plotted novel with likeable, interesting characters (the only exception is the narcissistic brother-assassin).  Huff does her usual good job with the minor characters, too.  I grew especially fond of the city guard who is one of the first to encounter the walking dead.  She survives the encounter, only to be demoted because no one believes her.  Next, she barely escapes death at the hand of the sister-assassin.  Finally, she stumbles across the assassin who has sworn to kill the brother-sister team because they deserted the Army..<br />I've already bought the sequel, &quot;No Quarter&quot; to see what happens to Vree and her new live-in companion.

Eric Hansen makes his case over and over again about CITES' blunders into the rarified world of orchidists, including the confiscation and slaughter of thousands of rare, nursery-grown orchids under the auspices of conserving them.<br />&quot;Blind rage, crippling jealousy, and wild exaggeration are commonplace in the quirky and insular world of orchid growing...&quot; but Hansen still manages to make a good case against CITES' mishandling of endangered (and not so endangered) flora.  He also intersperses his polemic with tales of wonderfully eccentric orchidists, monstrous orchid judges, and of course, the outrageously beautiful courtesans of the plant world themselves: the orchids.<br />If you think of orchid growing as an octogenerian's hobby in league with quilting or stamp collecting, here is Hansen's description of a wholesale orchid grower's catalogue:  &quot;I thumbed through the pages to familiarize myself with the range of flower forms.  Immediately I was confronted with centerfolds showing downy, smooth petals and moistened, hot-pink lips that pouted in the direction of tautly curved shafts and heavily veined pouches.&quot;<br />By all means, read this book if you want to learn why your great-auntie Em ditched her crochet-work and is now growing those weird-looking flowers on her sun porch.	2000-10-21

Even though I'm not a mushroom hunter myself, I enjoyed reading Schaechter's tale of mushrooms that can wreck trains, emit toxic fumes that have been used for rocket fuel, and send otherwise ordinary humans into gastronmical ecstasies (or gastrointestinal agonies, depending on the species).  The author points out that you can eat any mushroom once, and then goes on to quote, &quot;There are old mushroom hunters and bold mushroom hunters, but there are no old, bold mushroom hunters.&quot;<br />If you enjoy the thrill of a morel hunt and its tasty aftermath, or are an armchair naturalist who would like to read a well-written investigation into the secret life of fungi, &quot;In the Company of Mushrooms&quot; will both nourish and instruct you.  Just remember that there are two tons of fungi for every human on the planet!	2000-10-21

One of them is a Bag Lady who is genuinely smelly and not at all cute.  Another is a brain-damaged muffin maker.<br />The musician is singled out by Huff to endure a particularly gristly coming-of-age journey.  He is captured by ogres, and when he manages to escape from them, he has to run a gauntlet of ever more hideous fairy-tale creatures before he makes it back to Toronto to help save the Earth.<br />&quot;Get of Darkness Circle of Light&quot; is a pleasure to read, well-plotted, with an interesting twist at the end.  The most unlikely people band together in an attempt to defeat Evil, and Huff brings them all together in a way that satisfies and makes sense.	2000-10-17

Coaching high-impact, ambitious, hard-driving executives is not quite the same process as coaching under-performing employees, so this book probably has a smaller audience than say, &quot;Coaching for Dummies&quot;.  However, executive coaching is all about moving individuals into behaviors that sustain business, and there is lots of useful information for the coaches of non-leaders.  There is also a very interesting (and very short) chapter on, &quot;Coaching from Below&quot; by Deepak (Dick) Sethi.  Most of us could probably use that information!	2000-10-12

For some reason, the stories of other people's despair and suicide, including Alvarez's own attempted suicide always steadied me.  His book is a very literate account of why suicide is such a waste of life and talent. I wouldn't call it a cheerful book, but for me at least, reading it is a very cathartic experience.  Alvarez doesn't preach, he merely reports, but he has nevertheless written a very moving book.  Read it especially if you are depressed.  There is nothing like it on the bookshelves, except perhaps Styron's &quot;Darkness Visible&quot;.	2000-10-10

The witty dialogue never lets  up as the reluctant Keeper is summoned to the B&amp;B to either monitor or  seal the gate into Hell, and to somehow nullify the evil of the sleeping  Keeper in room 6, without waking her up.<br />My problem with &quot;Summon the  Keeper&quot; is the sexual innuendo.  A bit here and there is okay, but  Huff never lets up.  She takes the stereotypical situation of  &quot;beautiful young women throwing themselves at hard-boiled hero&quot;  and turns it inside out:  &quot;Summon the Keeper&quot; has two manly hunks  (one of them a ghost) who fall for the female Keeper. I wouldn't describe  the Keeper, Claire as 'hard-boiled', but she is unrelentingly crabby  throughout the whole novel.  Austin, the cat was much more likeable.<br />My  least favorite character was the ghost of a French-Canadian sailor who must  have learned English by watching Warner Brothers' PePe LePew cartoons.  He  was a totally obnoxious stereotype, and he never let up.<br />So, if you  aren't easily annoyed by a growling heroine, a character described as  &quot;the hunky-yet-innocent handyman&quot;, and a ghost who talks and acts  like a cartoon skunk, this is a very humorous and original fantasy.	2000-09-15

For  those of you who feel that dragons, unicorns, and bards are a bit overdone  nowadays, this fantasy offers up a heroine who binds the dead with a  bandolier of bells.  The Geography of Death is lovingly delineated, from  the prologue where Sabriel is born and dies and is rescued from the First  Gate of Death by her father, to the book's final quarter where Sabriel  rescues her father from the Fourth Gate of Death.  Unlike Dante's Inferno,  Death in this fantasy is a river, a waterfall, pools of black water,  strange currents that suck the spirit from the flesh.<br />Sabriel herself is  an English schoolgirl, recently graduated from Wyverley Academy with a  &quot;first in English, equal first in Music, third in Mathematics, seventh  in Science, second in Fighting Arts and fourth in Etiquette.  She had also  been a runaway first in Magic..&quot;  A visitation from the Dead sends  Sabriel on a quest through the magical Old Kingdom, in order to reunite her  father's body with his spirit which is trapped within the Fourth Gate of  Death.  She has to do battle with a really nasty necromancer-Adept,  and  rescue a prince who is a bit of a figurehead at first but who finally  develops into a memorable character in his own right.  Sabriel is both  helped and hindered by a very non-cuddly cat named Mogget.<br />&quot;Sabriel&quot; was first published in 1995, so I'm hoping there is  a sequel by now.  By all means, read this book if you love good fantasy.	2000-09-15

Reading a good fantasy is  usually like watching a good magic show:  one surprise after another.  There is suspense and breathless anticipation that is quickly resolved by  the next sleight-of-hand.<br />However, Patricia McKillip's novels are not  like a conjuror's act.  They make you work.  They make you read slowly.  Her clues are subtle and woven into the beautiful, but dense thicket of her  text.  This is especially true in &quot;Song for the Basilisk&quot;.  The  novel is every bit as complex and beautiful as its jacket painting by  Kinuko Craft, but sometimes it made me feel like one of the princes trapped  in the rose thicket outside of Sleeping Beauty's castle.  I wanted to  follow the little boy Rook from his hiding place in the ashes, through his  coming-of-age as a bard, to his eventual confrontation with the monster who  destroyed his family.  But it was hard.  I kept getting hooked on the  beautiful scenery, and the complex subplots, and the other intricately  fashioned characters.  The ancient, blind Reve Iridia and her haunting  music, and Luna Pellior, the Basilisk's daughter, were such strong and  interesting characters that they positively upstaged Rook/Caladrius/Griffin  every time they appeared with him on the same stage.<br />&quot;Song for the  Basilisk&quot; is definitely worth reading, and savoring, and rereading.  My only advice to the reader who is new to Patricia McKillip, is to start  with her &quot;The Riddlemaster of Hed&quot; trilogy, or &quot;The Book of  Atrix Wolfe&quot;.  They are equally magical books, but more accessible.	2000-09-04

Rolt's &quot;The Garside Fell  Disaster&quot;).  The short stories alternate with 'true' hauntings that  take place on or near the rails.  Some of the real life incidents were even  scarier than the story that they introduced.<br />&quot;Journey Into  Fear&quot; also includes a smattering of fantasy by Rudyard Kipling  (&quot;.007&quot;), Ray Bradbury (&quot;The Town Where No One Got  Off&quot;), and Robert Bloch (&quot;That Hell-Bound Train&quot;), among  others.  I didn't care for the Kipling selection, but the Bloch and  Bradbury stories were very, very good.  Even without a ghost, Bradbury's  story is one of the most haunting in the book.<br />This book would make a  good present for railroad buffs and ghost-story lovers.  It will definitely  become a permanent member of my ghost-story collection.	2000-08-31

The ghosts in this book could enter  the Miss America contest and get elected 'Miss Conviviality'.  In other  words, the Morgan Library ghosts are chatty losers.<br />I imagine  &quot;Morgan Library Ghost Stories&quot; might be a collectors' item some  day since it is published in a limited edition with nice wood engravings by  John De Pol.  However, those of you who enjoy a well-written, truly  frightening ghost story should give this book a pass.	2000-08-30

Sullivan concerns himself with the writers who can make you sick with  horror, not sick to your stomach, and who accomplish their goal through  indirection and suggestion, and brief glimpses of apparitions that will  stay with you long after you've finished their stories.<br />Temporally  speaking, Sullivan's chosen authors occupy the high ground between the  decaying castles and mouldering crypts of the Gothic, and the gory  surgeries of the modern horror tale.  He spends most of his book with Le  Fanu and M.R. James (as indeed, he must), but also makes room for L. P.  Hartley (&quot;The Travelling Grave&quot;), H. R. Wakefield (&quot;Old  Man's Beard&quot;), R. H. Malden (&quot;The Thirteenth Tree&quot;), and E.  G. Swain (&quot;The Stoneground Ghost Tales&quot;), among others.  M.R.  James claimed to be a follower of Sheridan Le Fanu, and the authors who  came after M.R. James claimed to be his follower, so there is a nice  continuity to &quot;Elegant Nightmares&quot;, and Sullivan exploits it to  the fullest.  Only his penultimate chapter on Algernon Blackwood strays a  bit from the 'antiquarian' mold, but so did Blackwood's ghost stories.<br />If  you treasure the 'old fashioned' ghost story, you should read Jack  Sullivan's elegant book on the best (male) authors in this difficult genre.  I subtracted one star from my rating only because he neglects the woman  who were contemporaries of Le Fanu and Blackwood, and who populated the  ghostly kingdom with very haunting stories of their own.	2000-08-27

Its narratives are the literary equivalent  of a Grandma Moses painting: a moment of time in rural America.  Most of  the narratives of ghostly encounters are charming, but not very  frightening, because there is no evocation of tension or suspense.  The  first story in the book is probably the scariest because it is one of the  few that does build up to supernatural climax.  One of my favorite stories  is about a guardian spirit who warns his human if there is speed trap on  the road ahead.  Another is about an old woman who made a pact with the  devil, so that she could spy on her neighbors through a flour sifter.<br />At  any rate, although this book did not really haunt me or frighten me in any  way, you may be charmed by its tales of rural Appalachia.	2000-08-19

I'm  so sick of words...' starts tying up my brain cells, this is the book I go  to.<br />This book isn't quite as well organized as James Neal's  &quot;Effective Phrases for Performance Appraisals&quot;, but it covers  favorable and unfavorable reviews, while Neal's book neglects unfavorable  reviews.<br />I also think Drewry's phrases have a bit more flair, especially  in the &quot;Complete the Phrase&quot; section for &quot;Below Average  Personal Performance (Chapter 11).  Here are some examples:  &quot;...Poor  planner.  Great hindsight.&quot;; &quot;...Inclined to berate others when  they fail to meet perfectionist standards.&quot;; &quot;...Lacking in  social grace and courtesy.&quot;  While not quite as cutting as, say,  &quot;one beer short of short of a six pack&quot;, Drewry quite wisely  reminds us that, &quot;Unfavorable bullets are deadly.

Jane and Michael  Stern have written an interesting, sweet, and sometimes sad book about the  'dog eat dog' competition in the American dog show ring.  The sadness comes  in when the authors describe the problems that we humans have wrought upon  our best friends, by breeding for a particular and possibly arbitrary trait  (size or hairlessness) and ignoring the consequences (hip dysplasia,  deafness, birthing problems).<br />The authors suffered from the purebred dog  syndrome themselves:  &quot;Some couples dream of a house, others of a  baby; we could think of nothing more enriching to our tender relationship  than the companionship of a drooling, flatulent Bulldog.&quot;<br />Richard,  the Bulldog was an utter failure in the showring but if he was the genesis  of &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;, then he was a very successful Bulldog, indeed.  Please read this book.  It is a droll, ingratiating, doggy slice of  Americana.	2000-08-16

Many  people think of Dr. Fager as a miler because he held the record for a mile  (8 furlongs) for almost three decades.  However, &quot;Doc&quot;  accumulated four championships, including Horse of the Year, running long  and running short, carrying weight,running on turf and running on dirt.  All he wanted to do was run.

Is the Damiano trilogy an alternate  history of a time when the pope was exiled in Avignon, and the Black Death  and the condottiere made life miserable, brutish, and short for almost  everyone else?  Is it the story of a witch who wanted to be a musician, and  his little talking dog?  Is it the tale of a struggle between two brothers,  who happen to be the Seraph, Raphael and Lucifer, Prince of  Darkness?<br />MacAvoy has a way of bringing me into every scene, using  precise language and memorable detail:<br />&quot;His mind was flooded with  the memory of this very pasture in the green of summer, when his father  would treat the sheep with tar poultices and incantation.  Grass up to his  half-grown knees, except where the flocks had cropped it.  It had been cool  then, in the mountains, but pleasant.  Sheep's milk.  Napping at midday,  surrounded by curious, odorous, half-grown lambs.&quot;<br />I wish MacAvoy  hadn't killed off my favorite characters, one by one, but it is a tribute  to the power of her writing that I kept reading, anyway.  I was hooked.  I  had to know how her trilogy ended.<br />If history is fair to fantasy authors,  Damanio and his lute and his little, talking dog will outlast all of the  overblown 'ologies' of Brooks, Goodkind, and Stephen King.	2000-08-14

The pre-flood  history of the small Pennsylvania mountain villages brought to mind a  combination of &quot;The Music Man&quot; and the &quot;dark, satanic  mills&quot; of the Industrial Revolution (steel, in this case).  Throw in a  mixture of class war and the prejudice of the 'native' Americans versus the  recently arrived Eastern European immigrants, and the book tells a good  story even without the advent of the flood.<br />However, the Johnstown flood  is the heart of McCullough's story and he does a very good job in building  up to the book's compelling climax.  When the dam above Johnstown finally  gives way, you will already be on the edge of your reading chair.  As  usual, in a story about a disaster, there are incredibly brave people and  also incredibly foolish ones.  I wish McCullough had told us a bit more  about the post-flood lives of some of his heroes and heroines, but that is  the only real fault I can find with his story.  A book like this always  makes me wonder how I would have reacted in the midst of the chaos, flood,  and fire that was Johnstown on May 31, 1889.	2000-08-13

James has many imitators and if you've read any ghost story  anthologies at all, you're probably already acquainted with him.  \\"Casting the Runes\\" and \\"Oh Whistle and I'll Come for You,  My Lad\\" are probably his two most collected stories, but they're all  good.  I still shiver through every one of them, and I've read all of his  stories at least a hundred times (well, maybe ten times).  His usual  protagonist is an elderly (or elderly seeming) scholar, British of course,  who gets himself into horrible, occult trouble by going where he shouldn't  go or reading what he shouldn't read.<br /><br />There are other good writers of  ghostly tales:  Sheridan LeFanu, Charles Dickens, E.F. Benson,  Shirley  Jackson, etc.; and Ramsey Campbell once wrote a short story in the style of  M.R. James that almost could have been written by the Master, himself.  However, if you haven't already read M.R. James' \\"Collected Ghost  Stories\\", please do so.  He is the writer by which all others in this  difficult genre are measured.	2000-08-11

Falcone urges us (and  explicitly tells us how to) write up work place problems in such a fashion  that adequately documents subpar performance, and encourages the employee  to rehabilitate himself or herself.<br />NOTE:  I see that other reviewers  emphasized the sample letters and diskette, so I'd just like to add that  Falcone's introductory chapters are also very informative and lucidly  written.  He tells you why and how you can treat a subpar employee fairly  and thus keep your corporation from having to hire back the employees that  you eventually had to fire.	2000-08-11

John Edward Weems' book was  first published in 1957 and was reissued for the seventh time in 1999.  He  was able to interview many of the survivors of the Galveston hurricane, and  one of the differences between his book and &quot;Isaac's Storm&quot;  (which was published over 40 years later) is that Weems tells his story  from many more points of view.<br />Erik Larson, author of &quot;Isaac's  Storm&quot; writes a more in-depth narrative about fewer  survivors.<br />Another difference 40 years has made, is that Larson is able  to go into much more detail about the origin of the hurricane and the  science behind the forces that made it so devastating.  He spends much more  time describing the days before the hurricane hit Galveston, and Weems  spends more time describing the aftermath of the storm and how the  survivors recovered and rebuilt.<br />Both books are compelling accounts of  this country's worst natural disaster.  You should read both of them,  especially if you happen to be in Galveston on the hundredth anniversary of  the Great Storm...and another hurricane is rolling through the Gulf.	2000-08-10

It  starts out like a 'noir' police procedural.  There are actually two mass  murderers on the loose in Yorkshire, one a 'standard' serial killer who  (usually)preys on isolated women. The other is an evil sorcerer who has  assumed the trappings of a late twentieth century 'faith healer'.  Detective Superintendent Vernon Laverne, the hero of &quot;The Death  Prayer&quot; has already captured one serial killer before the book begins.  His colleagues on the force applaud his results, but are suspicious of his  intuitive style of detection.<br />Excellent character development, and  chilling, bone-twisting scenes of supernatural horror are the hooks that  make &quot;The Death Prayer&quot; well worth reading.  Vernon Laverne is  much better developed, and consequently more interesting than the standard  run of paranormal detectives who rely on gimmicks (magic rings, pentacles,  weird ceremonies, etc.) to get their man (or demon).<br />You're really going  to admire him by book's end.<br />Speaking of book's end, I subtracted a star  because the end is a messy, anti-climax to the horror that occurred earlier  in the plot.  The scene in the Cathedral on New Year's Eve is especially  chilling, and my only wish is that the book's end could have reached a  similar height.	2000-08-07

However, Carol Zaleski succeeds in writing a very scholarly, fair-minded book, and  avoids the trap of attempting to envangelize the reader.  Either you  believe people have out-of-body experiences, or you don't and Zaleski  doesn't attempt to convert you.  What she does do (and this is what makes  &quot;Otherworld Journeys&quot; so fascinating) is examine the influence of  culture and religion on near-death experiences.  A twentieth-century  American will not report the same near-death experience as, say, a  thirteenth-century Italian.  Why that is true is for the reader to decide,  in light of the evidence presented by this interesting and well-researched  account.<br />I felt &quot;Otherworld Journeys&quot; was a definite keeper and  well worth re-reading.	2000-08-01

A few, really good examples of this true-life  disaster genre that I've read over the years are:  &quot;The Earth Shook -  The Sky Burned&quot; (San Francisco Earthquake)&quot;; &quot;The Coming  Plague&quot; (newly emerging diseases);  &quot;Great Lakes Shipwrecks and  Survivals&quot; (doomed on Lake Superior, etc.); &quot;Rats, Lice, and  History&quot; (a biography of typhus); and &quot;Isaac's Storm&quot; (the  Galveston hurricane of 1900).<br />Erik Larson's book on the deadliest  hurricane in history has two main focal points:  the hurricane itself; and  the human drama of Isaac Cline, the Galveston meteorologist who failed to  predict the intensity of the storm.  The book meanders through occasional  dry stretches of Isaac's pre-storm biography, and through the history of  the U.S. Weather Bureau (they were interesting, but not nearly as  interesting as the storm), but once it focuses on the events of September  8, 1900 and beyond, I wasn't able to set &quot;Isaac's Storm&quot; down.  Especially compelling are the eerie descriptions of what it's like to sail  through the eye of a hurricane, and of course the narrative (from the  viewpoints of several survivors) of what it was like to be in Galveston  before, during, and after the storm.  If you are afraid of storms or of  water, you might not want to read this book because Erik Larson puts you  right there when the storm debris is caving in the side of your house, or  when the &quot;tide suddenly rises fully four feet at one bound&quot;.	2000-07-30

They were un-put-downable.  I had to read through  the night to finish them.  Cooper has one of the most original, malign, and  imaginative minds in the fantasy business.  When I was unable to locate the  two other books of the Time Master prequel, I started working my way  through one of her earlier series:  the Indigo books, of which  &quot;Nemesis&quot; is the first.<br />&quot;Nemesis&quot; is the story of a  Celtic Pandora named Anghara who opens the wrong box and lets evil back  into the world.  There are large sections of imaginative, Cooperesque  fantasy and well worth reading.  In fact, I've already ordered the second  book in the Indigo series.  However, overall I'd have to guess that  'Nemesis' is one of Cooper's first ventures into fantasy.  The heroine is  an arrogant, impulsive, headstrong adolescent who doesn't really change  through the course of the book, even though her whole family is slaughtered  by the demons she frees, and her lover is condemned to purgatory until she  can rescue him.<br />The lover is the character I really feel sorry for.  He  is brave, kind, and completely innocent of wrong-doing and yet he is  condemned to a particularly awful life-in-death while Anghara-Indigo  escapes pretty much unscathed from her own act of wickedness (her hair  turns gray and a few months into the plot, she sprains her ankle).<br />With  occasional pick-me-ups from the Earth Mother, Anghara-Indigo sets out to  recapture the demons she let loose on the world, hindered by her nemesis  (an evil copy of herself with what appear to be vast supernatural powers)  and helped by a talking wolf.<br />'Nemesis' is a good fantasy and worth  reading, just not as good as Cooper's later books.	2000-07-30

The time frame is roughly the same as &quot;The Crystal Gryphon&quot;, but I'd rate this book a bit below &quot;The Crystal  Gryphon&quot; if only because the hero and heroine are not as likeable.  Brixia, who was once the lady of a Hall in High Hallack now hunts and  scavenges the deserted, post-invasion farmland of the Dales.  Her only  companion is the cat Uta.  Brixia and Uta are drawn into Waste where Light  and Dark Magic still exist, on a search for Zarsthor's Bane.  Brixia  discovers a place of Green Magic while under attack by one of the many  loathsome packs of creatures that inhabit the Waste.  Ultimately, she  rescues her companions (a wounded lord and his squire), but not before  Brixia survives a vintage Norton combat between the forces of Light and  Dark.  The banquet scene where Zarsthor confronts his Bane is especially  eery, and tingling with Norton's special brand of magical  description.<br />Well worth reading; in fact, a 'must' for WW fans.	2000-07-29

Forget Attila the Hun.  Ditch Machiavelli.  Stop thinking about your corporation in terms of a football game or a war.  There is a better metaphor, and you will be happier and more successful if you adopt it.  According to Robert Solomon (and he quotes Nietzsche among others, to prove  his case!), many of our personal values seem to be in conflict with those  of the corporation where we're employed, because our way of thinking about  business success has been poisoned by the mental models we use, and the  leaders who we are asked to emulate (football coaches and 'The Scourge of  God'? ).<br />&quot;A Better Way to Think About Business:  How Personal  Integrity Leads to Corporate Success&quot; delivers exactly what its title  promises, and has already helped me through a couple of ethical dilemmas  that I've had to resolve in the course of my job.  This book is very  clearly written and provokes clear thinking on the subject of business  ethics.  It does not insult your intelligence by stringing slogans together  and calling the result a 'business ethic'. (Personal note:  I am so bloody  sick of books that proport to teach me 'Managing by Values' and turn out to  be fluff and slogans and bad writing to boot. Business ethics is a very  complex and gut-wrenching subject, and some authors need to treat their  readers with a bit more honor and dignity.)<br />Sorry for the above tirade.  Read this book.  If you don't have time to read the whole thing, dip into  the 'Catalog of Business Virtues' at the end of the book and try to  schedule a virtue per day to think about on the long commute home.  I'm  sure I'll keep going back to Robert Solomon for a 'better way to think  about' the really tough business situations.	2000-07-26

We learn about the original settlers who  came through a Gate to the Dales, and their introduction to the Light and  Dark forces that still lingered among the ruins.  This book is vintage  Norton and a must for Witch World fans.  I withheld one star because 'Horn  Crown' is talkier and carries a bit less of a plot line than most of her WW  novels.  However, she has a lot to explain and 'Horn Crown' is, after all,  a prequel.  As always, her hero and heroine are outcasts from the normal  run of medieval settlers who came through the Gate in order to claim land  and build Holds.  The story is told from the masculine viewpoint, and there  is a bit more sex (although very tastefully done) than is usual for Norton.  We actually get to meet the Goddess Gunnora, who is an intriguing mixture  of Ceres, Diana, and Aphrodite (the latter two 'aspects' were a bit of a  surprise to me as I had always associated Gunnora with harvests and  childbirth, and not much more).  There's lots of interesting magic and  really evil creatures of the Dark (as I said, vintage Norton if you are a  WW fan).  You really need to read this if you liked 'Year of the Unicorn'  or 'The Crystal Gryphon'.	2000-07-24

They're good stories though, and well worth  repeating.  Scanlan reports a variation on 'The Pacing Mustang' (one of my  all time favorites):  the wild stallion who threw himself off of a cliff  rather than endure capture by men.  He includes a chapter on 'Epic Rides'  which made me want to just saddle up and go (one of his riders, A.F.  Tschiffely rode 10,000 miles from the tip of South of America to Washington  D.C. in two and a half years.  Anyone game for a trip from Texas to  Alaska?).<br />'Wild About Horses' would be an excellent book to give to your  horse-crazy teen-ager.  It's all about relationships (between horses and  humans, in this case) and is written in a laid-back, New Age style that is  easy to read.  Scanlan talks about his own experiences with horses, and if  you're a beginning rider you'll empathize with him!	2000-07-24

The musical imagery was especially  evocative in this story of a futuristic Orpheus a.k.a. the Queen of Hearts,  who rescues her sister from the Underworld (an orbiting penal colony).  The  killer sister, Terra Viridian comes to the best end possible, after we  discover why she killed fifteen hundred of her fellow soldiers.  That  mystery is the heart and plot of the book.<br />&quot;Fool's Run&quot; is  beautifully written, with characters that are drawn with the precision of  diamond on glass.  All of them are totally transparent; totally innocent.  I ached for all of them, especially for Terra Viridian.  The ending is  unsettled. The King of the Underworld gives up his throne and joins the  Queen of Hearts' band---a superficially happy conclusion.  But the thing  that was responsible for the deaths of fifteen hundred soldiers is now  watching them from orbit.	2000-07-21

I loved Norton's books for their thumping good  plots, exotic, yet believable aliens, and most especially for her finely  drawn portraits of the crew.  Many of the fantasies that got me through a  boring English Lit or Government class involved flying off into the wild,  black yonder aboard the 'Solar Queen'.<br />Unfortunately, our library only  carried the first two books in the series, but I finally located the two  'Solar Queen' novelettes and read them, too.  They weren't quite as good -  Norton was concentrating on fantasy by then, and somehow it didn't quite  mix with the crew of the 'Solar Queen'.  However, I never lost my original  affection for the series.<br />Then, decades after the publication of the  original novels, I found 'Redline: the Stars'.  I couldn't wait. I bought  it in hardback rather than  holding out for a cheaper edition.  The fact  that it had a second author's name on it was worrisome, but I assumed I'd  be reading mainly Norton.<br />Not true.<br />I read the book from cover to  cover, hoping to find at least a trace of Norton and a trace of the  original 'Solar Queen', then hurled &quot;Redline: the Stars&quot; into the  wastebasket.<br />I felt totally cheated.  I usually give up my non-keepers to  the library and loan my keepers to my friends, but I couldn't pass this one  on to some other poor, unsuspecting Solar Queen fan.<br />I am pretty sure  that all Norton wrote was the introduction to &quot;Redline: the  Stars&quot;.  The original characters were passive, uninteresting shadows -  even the Captain and the Cargo Master!. I felt like I was reading someone  else's adolescent fantasy of the 'Solar Queen' and her crew that never  should have been published under Norton's name.

Now, if this had been a romance and not a fantasy, I would have guessed right away that she was pregnant, and  not cursed by a wizard or suffering some equally fantastical stomach  ailment.  However, this book is a fantasy and Annice's long term lover is  another woman, so I was as surprised as she was, when our heroine finally  visits the healer.  In spite of the fact that about a quarter of the novel  is spent describing Annice's pregnancy, her reaction to being pregnant, and  other people's reaction to her being pregnant, it is a good read.  Among  those who Annice manages to rescue before giving birth are a boy who can  'sing' to air and water sprites (saved from drowning), the one-night-stand  who fathered her child (who was about to lose his head to the King's  executioner), and her long-term lover (who was wasting away in a dungeon).  Quite a list of accomplishments for someone who had problems maneuvering  her growing girth up the curves of a spiral staircase!  Anyway, the  characters in this book are lovingly developed, and the mix of religion and  wizardry is quite intriguing.  The vividly described all-night vigil in the  cathedral on the longest night of the year was the hook that drew me into  'Sing the Four Quarters' and I kept going through the night until I came to  story's end.  Now, I'll have to order the sequel.	2000-07-17

I've read all of her previous (solo) Witch World volumes at least three times each, and my very favorites,  probably nine or ten times (the first four WW novels plus 'Year of the  Unicorn'). Therefore, I feel qualified to comment on Norton's use of her  previously developed characters in this volume. They came across as wooden:  like someone had found a set of puppets in an old trunk in the attic,  dusted them off, and strutted them across a very familiar stage.  I was  disappointed (to say in the least).  Here were all of my old friends,  together at last, and acting as though they would really rather be  somewhere else.<br />However, even if I'd known in advance that I was going to  be disappointed, I still would have read the book, just to find out how  Hilarion, Simon Tregarth and his family, and the Were-riders were getting  along.  All of you real Witch World fans will have to do the same.  Buy the  book.  Read it. Bid Witch World 'Hail and Farewell'.<br />More unsolicited  advice for old Norton fans: Don't buy any of the imitation Witch Worlds  that were authored by collaborators, even if Norton's name appears on the  cover.

Peter Conrad's subtitle, 'The Meaning of Opera' could be expanded to:  'The Meaning of Opera to me, personally.  Here's what it  feels like to experience opera, up close, and in your soul.'  The last  chapter, 'The Ecstasy and Agony of Song' would also make a good alternative  title.  If you want to know what opera 'feels' like, read this book.  It's  my favorite, with the possible exception of Father Owen Lee's writings,  even though the author makes fun of one of my favorite singers for baring  his chest on stage.<br />If you are looking for a thoughtful, immensely  readable alternative to 'A Dummy's Guide to Opera', read 'A Song of Love  and Death'.  It's the closest you'll ever get to 'reading' the liebestod.	1999-01-24
