Michael Connelly has put aside, for the moment, his Harry Bosch novels and stepped into the world of the \\"legal thriller.\\" I'm sorry he waited this long to do it.<br /><br />Mickey Haller is a \\"Lincoln lawyer.\\" That does not mean that Lincoln was his idol or that he was elected to some prestigious group. What it means is that Mickey uses a Lincoln Towne car as his office and his mode of transportation amongst the various court houses in the LA area. After 15 years of practice, whatever high ideals about the law he may have had have pretty much gone by the wayside. In his opinion \\"the law is a large rusting machine that sucks up people and lives and money. I am just a mechanic and I have become expert at going inside the machine and fixing things and extracting what I need from it in return.\\"<br /><br />In this artfully crafted story, Haller is retained to represent a young man who is alleged to have assaulted and attempted to rape his victim. However, as he investigates the case, doors from the past open and he is eventually confronted with one of the most delicious legal delemnas an attorney can confront. To try and outline the story here would only spoil it for you later. The writing is powerful and the court room  action is authentic.<br /><br />This is a tale which will hold your attention from beginning to end and leave you looking for Mr. Connelly's next excursion into this type of fiction.	2005-10-12

Linda Greenlaw was one of the \\"stars\\" in the book, The Perfect Storm by Sebastian Junger. Subsequently, she has written three autobiographical books of her own talking about her adventures as a longline fishing captain and a lobsterman. Now, Linda and her Mom, Martha, have come up with a cookbook which is more than just that. It talks about an approach to cooking and eating which is as interesting as the receipes that grace the pages. Not only are the receipes mouthwatering, but the writing (and photography) that accompany the book are a treat as well. Funny, irreverant and so Down East that you cannot wait to start road testing these puppies. For those of us who are \\"natives\\" the former \\"Official Cookbook of Maine\\" was written by Marge Standish. It was the one you always went to when you wanted to cook something like your Mom used to and people didn't worry about calories or cholesteral. Well, move over Marge. Martha (and Linda) are the new authorities on Down East Cooking. Some of the recipies such as \\"Jello shots\\" and how they got put in the book will just make you laugh out loud. Should I ever find myself stranded on the Isle Au Haut, I will just follow my nose to Martha's kitchen.  <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor if you like to cook and give yourself this book and if you are wondering about Christmas presents...look no further.	2005-09-25

Having finished this novel, I have now read all of Wilbur Smith thirty novels and I must say that the man never strays far from what made us start reading him in the first place. His novels are not for the faint of heart as there is considerable cruelty in them, both with animals and our fellow man, but that is the way things happened during the times he writes about. There are also some fairly graphic sexual accounts. If that is not your cup of tea, you had probably better find a different author. However, Smith in his books always follows the thread of history in whatever part of the African continent he is writing about and gives life and color to a part of the world that many of us know too little about. This book is set basically in The Sudan and brings to life the seige of Khartoum and it's aftermath in a most interesting and realistic way. As in many of his books, a Ballantyne and a Courtney are prominently featured along with many other characters from both history and Mr. Smith's most fertile mind. My only criticisim of the book is that with 50 or so pages to go I was looking forward to the sequel. Alas, that is not to be. However, the story is vintage Wilbur Smith and if he is someone you enjoy reading, this novel will not change that.	2005-09-25

Ben Anderson has made a scientific discovery worth dying for and there are a number of people in this book that intend to see that he does just that, after they obtain his secret.

Others are trying to find and protect him, chief among them being Sam Wintripp a former covert operative and Ben's friend and protegee Haley Walthers. Frick has framed Sam and Haley concerning several murders and has the sherrif's people as well as some imports he has brought in hunting for Sam, Haley and Ben. The action literally pounds over 472 pages of the novel as the forces of good and evil wage a war for what could be one of the most amazing discoveries the world has ever seen.

However, as a private pilot and a person who loves most everything to do with aviation<br /><br />I felt myself in need for some reading about flying and a friend I have met on the Internet suggested this one. I'm glad she did.<br /><br />In this story, Nance describes a very interesting aspect of the aviation community and one who's job is underappreciated by those of us who do not live in parts of the country where wild fires and forest fires are a common summer occurance.<br /><br />There are men and women who climb into aging aircraft that have been modified to carry a mixture called \\"slurry\\" which is a fire retardant which is dropped from the skies in advance of a fire. Not like bombing during WW 2 from thousands of feet up, but right over the fire where the turbulence and danger is real and often unpredictable.<br /><br />This story involves fighting a fire in the area of Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Park. The planes are DC-6B's and a P-3 Orion all owned by Jerry Stein. The log books say that they have all been inspected for signs of aging and metal fatigue at an independant location in Florida and then stored in Roswell, NM until the firefighting season began. However, there are indications that this may not have been the case. When a wing folds up on one of the DC6-B's while fighting the fire concerns grow and the mystery of where these planes have been and how safe they are become a paramount question for Clark Maxwell one of the most respected pilots in the fleet. There are various subplots within the book involving smoke jumpers, the role of the lead aircraft who runs the boming plan, the problems of dealing with people on the ground who do not want to leave the path of the fire and so on. It is a book which holds you interest, delivers an interesting story and also points out the problems of how we fight fires and manage the forests in the country. Entertainment and an education. Hard to beat.	2005-09-10

I'm so glad that Reed Arvin didn't settle for being a successful Nashville music producer, because he is well on his way to being one of the best of the court room/thriller/mystery writers of our time. His previous two novels (The Will and The Last Goodbye) are excellent reads and all three are stand alone books. Thomas Dennehy is the central character in this book, but he has a wealth of company from the fertile mind of Mr. Arvin to keep this novel going at full throttle from page one to the end. Others have set out the story line quite well, so I will only say that if you enjoy this type of novel, there is none better on the market right now that you could buy. <br />The characters and dialogue are so authentically written that their voices and sounds come right off the pages. The villian in this book does not reveal himself for a while, but when he does, he is enough to give you nightmares.	2005-09-05

Once again, Paul Madriani is back in court with his faithful sidekick, Harry Hinds. They are called upon to defend a highly decorated Army sergeant Emiliano Ruiz, who is charged with murdering the CEO of a firm that he has formerly been in charge of providing security for. There is evidence of an affair of some kind between the two and that Ruiz stalked the victim after his security detail was discharged by her. The gun used to kill her was issued to Ruiz while he was in the service and the type of shooting that killed her was known as a \\"double tap\\", a type of killing method that Ruiz was expert at. <br /> <br />Harry sums up their situation quite neatly as the trial nears: \\"Wonderful,\\" says Harry. \\"We have a client who won't tell us where he was or what he was doing for seven years, who is caught on video in the buff doing push ups on the victim on her office couch. We have an exhibition of fine shooting that, in the absence of a critical piece of evidence or Annie Oakley, could only have been done by that same client. And if that wasn't enough,\\" he says,\\"now we have to try the case against the 'Death Dwarf.'\\" <br /> <br />The \\"Death Dwarf\\" is Paul Templeton, a diminutive but highly effective prosecutor who presence in the case makes the trial aspect of the case indeed difficult for Madriani and Hinds and highly entertaining for the reader.  <br /> <br />How Madriani goes about defending this case as well as the mystery of who did kill Madelyn Chapman is Steve Martini at his best. I have read all of his books and was somewhat dissapointed with the previous effort, The Arraignment. However, in Double Tap he is back in form and at the top of his game. The writing of this book took some time, but in this case, it was worth the wait.  <br />	2005-09-01

He has cemented that reputation with Shock Wave.<br /><br />Special FDLA agent Jim Tasker is back as are several of the folks that we met in the first novel. He isn't having any more luck in trying to get his ex-wife to return and even less luck in getting along with the FBI. The loose cannon in this story is a guy named Daniel Welles. Welles is mistakingly arrested as part of a joint law enforcement effort to bring down the seller of a Stinger missile. While he had nothing to do with that sale other than return a repaired possum trap to the seller, he soon becomes very much on their radar screen after Tasker manages to get him freed from custody on the missile charge.<br /><br />Welles likes to blow things up. So far it has been relatively harmless unless you count a guy who was killed when a bomb he made on a cruise ship killed a baggage handler. The FBI agent in charge of that investigation wasn't too concerned (\\"The guy wasn't even an American\\") However, Welles has bigger and better plans and most of the book is spent watching his plans develop and the efforts of the Florida law enforcement community try to bring him down. The action is steady, the characters are truly characters and you willl finish the book eagerly awaiting the next one. Oh, yes! There will be a next one.	2005-08-26

This is a book that most readers will find unsettling. Not so much for the terrific story contained within, but more for the history lesson the reader receives about the Saudi Royal family, the tenuousness of the world's oil supply, and the danger posed to the non-Muslim world by the Wahhabis, the radical Muslim movement from which all modern Islamic terrorisim has sprung. We can hope and pray that there are many Scot Harvaths out there doing the work of defending us from the plots and plans of the radical Muslims, but no one should be sanguine that the threat is not real and the situation is not truly dangerous. <br /> <br />Brad Thor weaves a chilling tale involving the release of a disease which can cause a pandemic in the non-Muslim world with its roots in the crossing of the Alps by Hannibal hundreds of years ago. There is no need for a suspension of belief in reading this book as the author lays out his case very well and convincingly.  <br /> <br />This book is hard to put down and the world situation it describes will give you some sleepless nights, however you owe it to yourself to read and learn from one of the masters of this genre.	2005-08-18

However, the story of the prison escape, the subsequent identity change and his taking revenge not only require some suspension of belief, but his conduct seems out of character and in some ways the revenge that is taken is an anti-climax. That is disappointing to say the least, and have cost this writer at least two stars in my estimation.	2005-08-05

If you are an active secularist you might as well save your money. If your politics are decidedly liberal, you will probably not like this book. However, you have an open mind on the issues of religion and Christianity or a religious bias in your life, this novel can be unsettling, scary and compelling. One thing Joel Rosenberg does not do in this book is fail to document his thesis and he also does not fail to spin another complicated and riveting story about the politics and dangers of the world we live in. There were portions of the story which I thought could have been handled better, especially the Erin McCoy - Jon Bennett saga near the end, however this book is not trash as some have suggested and does not deserve to be trashed. It deserves to be read as a thoughtful piece of writing.	2005-08-05

You can now add James Born to the list. The \\"money\\" referred to in the title is loot that was skimmed from the coffers of the Committee for Community Relief, which is a scam run by a pseudo civil rights leader, The Reverend Alvin T. Watson and his lawyer, Cole Hodges. It starts the story residing in a safe deposit box in the Alpha National Bank of Miami, Overton branch. By the end of the story it has traveled through many hands, been the cause of some blood shed, spawned conspiracies among some of Florida's law enforcement community and been pursued by more people than a two dollar whore at a truck stop in Texas. During the time of Watergate we learned that in order to get to the bottom of a mystery that one should \\"follow the money.\\" In this case it is easier said than done, but everyone is trying. A solid writing debut for Mr. Born.	2005-07-12

Jeffery Deaver's novels have more twists and turns than a roadway through the Alps and taking the ride can be just as thrilling. While this novel involving Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs does not have the level of malevolence and scariness of some of his previous efforts, there is still plenty there for those who have been hooked by the activities of these crime scene investigators. The basic story is simple. Someone is trying to kill Geneva Settle, a 16 year old black teenager who is doing some historical research. In fact, as the book moves along it seems that everyone is trying to kill her. The question is why. The answer is not easily arrived at although a lot of reasons come filtering through the attempts on her life. All you can do is what you always do with a Deaver novel. Sit back and let the master lead you through the story to the end. It is a trip worth taking.	2005-07-07

My wife looked up from her reading and asked, \\"Did you finish it?\\" I paused a moment and with the only response I could think of I stated simply, \\"It is finished.\\"    As you have noted, if you have read other reviews you know this is a story spawned by the Vietnam War and written by an author who was there, as a Roman Catholic Marine Corps Chaplin having previously served in the Marine Corps as a 2nd Lt. and platoon leader before Viet Nam.     However, Vietnam and the story of Billy Kern, Isaiah Ross, and Patric Gallo could have been any other place on the planet where good and evil come into conflict and where people explore the  meanings of life's larger issues.    My wife then asked me another question. \\"How was it?\\" Again, I paused and then gave her the same reposnse I would give anyone who asked. \\"Haunting.\\"    This is a book that can be read more than once and contains issues that all of us who care about the human condition can well afford to reflect on.

He makes it seem so easy, yet I defy you to sit down and write like he does.

He is THAT good.<br /><br />There are so many twists and turns to the story of Matt and Olivia Hunter that I'm not sure I could get them all in a description of the book and if I could, it would spoil the read for you.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that he carries the story along in a way that you never get tired of. The end of every chapter has a hook in it and the writing is absolutely first rate.

His latest does not disappoint. In setting up his main character, Joseph Antonelli finds himself as a guest on one of those interminable cable news channel \\"talk\\" shows about topics of the day in which the host and some of the guests have a preordained point of view and then proceed to roast and belittle anyone who opposes it. On this show Antonelli and a young law profesor, Justin Sinclair are the roastees and their protestations that you cannot prejudge guilt or innocence based upon newspaper stories and rumors are treated like a pinata at a Mexican birthday party. <br /> <br />Soon thereafter, Sinclair is charged with murdering one of the other guests on the show, Daphne McMillan. McMillan is a prosecutor and she is also married to a man, who as it turns out may have murdered his first wife and is more than capable of murdering Daphne. However, the circumstances of the murder, in Sinclair's home, her blood on his hands and evidence of a romantic relationship which she was ending lead the talk show types to convict Sinclair in advance and during the trial that follows, not even the great Joseph Antonelli can save him from being convicted. <br /> <br />The retribution which follows the conviction is interesting and at times a bit fanciful, but Buffa never lets certain things stand in his way of telling a story and while some liberties are taken, the story suffers not at all. While the novel stands as an indictment of the cable mentality that infects this nation and much of the world, it is also first rate fiction written by an author who desrves all of the awards he has been given.	2005-06-02

Her mother becomes a recluse, clinging to her memory. Her father becomes a drunk and homeless. Seventeen years later the case remains unsolved and becomes the first case on the radar screen of the newly reunited detective team of Harry Bosch and Kit Rider. After three years of \\"retirement\\" Bosch has been brought back to the fold and given a new job. In describing it, the Chief of the LAPD tells Bosch and Rider, \\"...this squad is the most noble place in the building. A city that forgets its murder victims is a city lost. This is where we don't forget. We're like the guys they bring in in the bottom of the ninth inning to win or lose the game. The closers...If you're in homicide, this is the place to be.\\" <br /> <br />And with that advice, Bosch starts in a new chapter of his life as an LAPD detective. The story unfolds as Bosch and Rider delve into the prior investigation, looking at old evidence and coming up with new takes on it. Many dead ends, some promising leads, some of which evaporate and some which do not. It is pure detective work and it is fascinating to watch it play out. <br /> <br />This is not a book with a lot of sudden twists and turns for the reader, yet it holds the interest from the first page to the last. Harry Bosch had been getting into some strange events during his retirement. Now that he is back on the force, some old devils return to plague him and have to be dealt with. The Open-Unsolved Unit has one objective when it takes on a case. \\"Close it down and put someone in jail.\\" That is what Harry has always done best and this book is a happy return to that kind of story.	2005-06-01

Anytime you want an exercise in reading good writing, writing that will cary you into the wee hours of the night, writing that will have you wondering how on earth it all turns out, writing that will give you fits of envy if you harbor any ideas of authorship yourself, then I recommend you slip into a William Lashner novel and his most recent is as good a place to start as any.  <br /> <br />Victor Carl has no illusions about himself. He would like to be witty, charming, a dragon in the criminal court room, a lion in the bed room, a fashion plate, and without fear. Alas, while he is far from being the schmuck he would like you to believe he is, life is a struggle for our hero. <br /> <br />This episode starts with Victor and Beth Derringer, the smarter and better looking half of the team of Derringer and Carl interviewing a convicted murderer. He has paid them $500 for the opportunity to talk to them and to try and convince them to take on his quest for a new trial because, what else, he is innocent. A review of the basic facts of the case convince Carl otherwise and he has no intention of becoming involved, until he is asked \\"How about if I arrange for you to be paid whatever money you require?\\" When the sum of $10,000 is promised, Carl notes in an aside to the reader, \\"See, sometimes it is just that easy to fall down a hole.\\" <br /> <br />And down he falls. Perhaps no one since Alice in Wonderland has had such an adventure from such a fall. <br /> <br />The first problem is to find grounds for a new trial. It will not spoil the read to disclose that finding the grounds is the least of Carl's problems. With the new trial secured Carl starts on an adventure that seems to be a true Don Qixote quest. As the trial suffers through various twists and turns there is a sub-story involving Carl's involuntary pro bono work in the family court. It is funny, touching, poignant and slightly interwoven with events that are transpiring in the larger issue in his life. <br /> <br/>Some years ago there was a movie entitled, \\"What About Bob?\\" This book could have had the same title and if that sounds like a non sequitur, then you need to read the book to find out about Bob. Carl describes Bob to the reader by noting that \\"...every so often, I run across a force of nature that shakes my sublime self centeredness to the very roots. Soomething that tears through the landscape like a tornado, leaving nothing but ruin and reexamination in its wake. Something like Bob.\\" <br /> <br />I assure you the read will be worth the time and that if you are not a Lashner fan yet, you will be.  <br />	2005-05-21

It seems superflouous to review a book that has 237 other reviews on Amazon, not counting the two professional reviews that precede those of the readers, however reporting on what I read is what I do, so here goes.    John Grady Cole is in for it. You know it from the moment you start the book and meet him at his grandfather's funeral. You are positive of it when near the mid point of the book he is finally able to talk to the daughter of his Mexican employer whom he has been worshipping from afar. They are riding their respective horses and she wants to swap. As he slides to the ground to comply with her wishes, he notes that \\"You are fixin to get me in trouble.\\" Her reply holds true for the rest of the book, \\"You are in trouble.\\"    The story winds itself about Cole's troubles and adventures, dreams and disappointments and does so in a manner that draws the reader along to the point where you feel like a rider on one of the \\"pretty horses.\\"     McCarthy's style of punctuation, i.e. lack of, and his frequent lapse into the Mexican language can be annoying, but there is nothing wrong with his story telling. It is the first book in what he calls The Border Trilogy and as such is a promising start with many trails to ride before it closes.	2005-05-15

There is enough monkey business going on at the Micanopy Indian Casiono to keep Tony Valentine busy for...well...at least a whole novel. This is the third in the Tony Valentine series and if you have not caught up with these novels yet, what on earth are you waiting for? I have now read them all and even though I started with the most recent novel first, each story pretty much stands on it's own and very little is lost buy not having read them in sequence. Valentine is a trouble shooter and problem solver for the casino industry which puts him in touch with some pretty \\"interesting\\" people on both sides of the sams he is hired to investigate. In this one he is dealing with a gangster names Rico Bianco and another bad guy by the name of Victor Marks. Swain likes to populate his novels with attractive and nubile ladies and the chief morsel in this one is a dish by the name of Candy Hart.Candy is the \\"raggle\\" who is being used as bait to swindle an aging Brtish rock star by Bianco, but on the way to the big payoff, she let her heart get in the way of her head and the plot takes a turn which makes Candy's life more interesting and fragile. The other monkey in the story is a chimp, as in chimpanzee. Mr. Beauregard by name. He has many talents. One of them is playing the ukelele. The others you will need to read the book to find out about. Swain has the knowledge, background and imagination to make his Valentine books a treat to read. Try one and you will be a fan. Guranteed!	2005-05-09

In the sequel to \\"Glory in the Name,\\" James Nelson reintroduces us to Lt. Samuel Bowater of the Confederate Navy and his Chief Engineer, Hiernoymus Taylor. Bowater has not had the best of times since resigning his commission in the US Navy and joining the Navy of the Confederacy. His first two commands have been shot out from under him. As this story commences, he is about to put the torch to his third command, the ironclad Tennessee, which lies unfinished in a Memphis shipyard. She must not be allowed to fall into the hands of the advancing Yankees and thus she is sacrificed.<br /><br />As this is happening, his lover, Wendy Atkins has listened long enough to the US guns advancing on Portsmouth, Va. and has decided to leave the comfort and relative safey of her Aunt Molly's home to find Samuel. She is halted in this hasty endeavor by her aunt who points out the dangers involved in her action as well as her lack of experience and understanding of such matters As she dissolves in tears at the realization of the futility of her quest, Wendy hears her aunt say, \\"We'll be alright. We'll find your sailor boy.\\" WE? \\"We\\" indeed!<br /><br />Thus begins the parallel stories of the travels and travails of Samuel and Wendy. Either story is probably sufficient for a novel, but placed together, Nelson shows that he is still the master of the art of story telling. Historical accuracy and technical precision are things we have come to expect from his writing. However, all of that is for naught without the talent to spin a yarn and in this one the spinning is pure gold.<br /><br />We also meet a new and unforgettable character early on. As Nelson introduces him, \\"It was a month before the burning of the Tennessee and ten hours after he met the man, that Samuel Bowater first saw someone smash a chair over Mississipi Mike Sullivan's head.\\"<br /><br />Self described as \\"the hardest drivin, hardest drinkin, most dangerous son of a whore riverboat man on the Western Waters,\\" Sullivan isthe captain of the sidewheel ram, General Page, one of the odd lot of vessels that make up The River Defense Fleet. In need of passage to Memphis for his men and himself to take command of his ironclad, Bowater accepts Sullivan's offer to ferry them there.<br /><br />This is the first of many adventures that they share, but in many respects they cannot hold a candle to the perils that Wendy and Molly encounter. Trust me, there is enough suspense, danger and adventure in these stories to satisy even the most jaded of readers.<br /><br />Nelson has written numerous engaging stories of The Pirate Round and The Revolutionary War. I believe his Civil War novels are the best of a very good lot.	2005-05-01

He is retired as a cop, but he has a brisk business that he has started at the tender age of 62, assisting the casino industry to indentify and eliminate those who are trying to run scams against them. His son Gerry, who has been a problem all of his life has agreed to turn over a new page and go into business with his Dad. Meanwhile, his new wife is expecting their first child and Tony's first grandchild. To help Gerry understand some of the scams, he sends him to a \\"school\\" which teaches those who have a yen to win some money by not playing by the rules, how to do it. In the meantime Tony is having his own adventures which among other things involves saving a lovely \\"jumper\\" whom he feels a strong attraction to; dealing with a massive attempt to bankrupt The Acropolis which brings back an old enemy from the past; avoiding the murderous attempts of a local cop who blames Tony for his mistress's murder and generally dealing with the various issues which pop up in his life. Gerry's problems eventually move center stage as he becomes unwittingly involved with an Osama Bin Laden terrorist group. While the story is entitled Loaded Dice, it seems to be Tony's life that is on overload and while this story doesn't carry all of the gambling interest of previous novels, there is plenty here to keep fans of Tony Valentine shaking their heads and turning the pages. To tell more would spoil the story.	2005-04-24

I am always pleased to find that the first effort of a succcessful author may be right up there with his best works. I discovered Brian Haig by reading his must recent novel, The President's Assassin. As a result of that I ordered and have read all of his novels that preceeded it. This one was the last read and the first written. The other modern author whose first effort I have been this pleased with was John Grisham. I still believe that his first novel, A Time To Kill, remains his best work. I would rank this one as Haig's best also. For character development, the way the story spins out, dialogue, intrigue, etc., it is all there. After Tucker Anderson's review sets the story, I can not improve on that, although we disagree on it's merit. As a trial lawyer all my life, although not a JAG attorney, the study of the situation, the interrogation of the witnesses, the dealing with the politics of the situation and the very real issues that arose as a result of all of that, I found the story compelling and one I hated to put down before I got to the last page. Brain Haig is a true talent and an author to look forward to.	2005-04-22

I recently read the newest novel in the Tony Valentine series and liked it a lot. So much so that I bought all the prior ones and this book is the first in the series. You either like this type of book or you don't. Las Vegas characters, scheming, gambling and looking for the big score. Not through luck, but by design and the big score by scamming is what Tony Valentine is all about stopping. The set up to the attempt at the score is complicated and as it unfolds you're not sure that Tony's \\"grift sense\\" is working i.e., the ability to spot a scam. Getting to the payoff is almost as much fun as you can have with your clothes on in this wild, bawdy and very entertaining read. Mr.Swain has found his niche and those who chose to join him in the adventures of Tony Valentine will not be disappointed.	2005-04-12

CEO of a Fortune 500 Company. Big salary. Big house. Big responsibilities. However, when you look more closely as Joseph Finder has us do, few would like to trade places. Conover's wife has died a year before in a tragic accident. His children are taking the loss hard. His company has had to undergo some significant down sizing which has required him to lay of half of it's ten thousand workers in the smallish town of Fenwick, Michigan. That has earned him a nickname among the locals -\\"Nick the Slasher.\\" Someone has been breaking into his house and scrawling grafitti on the walls which says, \\"No Hiding Place.\\" <br />The police are indifferent to his problems, even after another break in results in the murder of the family dog. There is a suspect. A laid off employee by the name of Andrew Stadler, but that is as far as it goes. <br /> <br />Fearing for the safety of his children, Nick prevails on his Security Director, Eddie Rinaldi, to install a sophisticated  <br />state of the art security system. Rinaldi also gives him something else for family protection. A Smith and Wesson .380 pistol. <br /> <br />Several nights later he is awakened by the alarm and taking the <br />pistol he goes down to investigate and finds Stadler advancing towards the house. Conover confronts him outside the house and warns him to stay away. The man pays no attention and keeps advancing and muttering \\"You are never going to be safe.\\" After several warnings Conover fires and the intruder lies dead. <br /> <br />Rinaldi is called and sizing up the situation advises that Conover cannot afford to report this to the police given their attitude toward him and the fact that the use of deadly force was unwarranted. Rinaldi polices the area, cleans up the evidence and takes the body and the weapon. The body later turns up in a seamy area of town in a dumpster an apparent victim of a bad drug deal. The weapon is gone. Nick is in the clear.Or is he? <br /> <br />That question becomes the focus of the rest of the book along with the subplot of skullduggery within the company to undercut his authority and force it's sale to overseas interests. <br /> <br />There are interesting wheels within wheels in the investigation of the murder of Stadler, yet the focus moves slowly and steadily to Rinaldi and Conover. A new woman enters the scene who seems to be restoring some order to Conover's life and those of his childen. Interestingly and amazingly, she is the daughter of the murdered man.  <br /> <br />Finder has crafted another one of his masterpieces with this book and to tell you more of the plot would spoil the read. His novels are always something to look forward to and this one joins the other five as a book to put on your reading table.  <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-04-09

I had expected it to talk about the planes and pilots of the Viet Nam War, but I did not expect the eye opening experience that this book turned out to be. John Sherwood steps on some toes in this book and as a result some of the reviews herein reflect personal displeasure when his stories come too close to home or cut too close to the bone. I found the book to be a sobering experience and one which awoke much of the anger that many of us felt about how this war was conducted, not only by the generals, but more especialy by the politicians all the way up to LBJ. The fact that we dropped eight million tons of bombs in SE Asia and lost over 8,500 planes and helicopters without winning the war is an unsettling fact. However, bombs do not deliver themselves and real people were in those planes and helicopters and a great many of them lost their lives in this mishandled piece of business. It is the spirit of those that fought, even when their hands were tied by the ones in charge with foolish rules of engagement that is at the heart of the story that is told. It is not a pretty story. It is often a story of the raw underbelly of war, but it is a story that needed to be told and John Sherwood, an official U.S Naval Historian tells it without fear or favor. Had the war been managed in that fashion, the outcome would have been much different. He has my gratitude for doing it.	2005-04-05

This was my first experience with Mr. Swain's writing and his central character, Tony Valentine. It won't be my last. In fact I have already ordered all of his previous novels and if that isn't an indication of how talented this writer is as a story teller, than I don't know what is. Mr. Lucky is a book you read just for it's sheer entertainment value. Ricky Smith, a loser all of his life, has just won $20,000 gambling in Las Vegas. He has brought a georgeous babe up to his room to celebrate. She has her own ideas of celebration and tries to slip him a Mickey which he catches her at. In the midst of throwing her out of his room, he discovers the hotel on the Vegas strip is on fire. There is no escape for Ricky except to jump from his balcony. His luck continues and he survives the fall and then goes on one of the most remarkable gambling streaks that has ever been seen in Las Vegas. It is almost too good to be true, which is exactly what the casino owners in Vegas believe and his million or so dollars in winnings are held up pending an investigation. Enter Tony Valentine, owner of Grift Sense, a gambling consulting company and one of the most knowledgeable men on the face of the earth concerning scams that people try to perpetrate on casinos. Tony sets out to try and explain how such a streak of luck is a con and while he is doing it, Ricky continues his streak winning a lottery drawing and picking three winners in a horse race to show his luck is still holding. <br /> <br />Checking Ricky out takes Tony to Slippery Rock, NC, Ricky's sleepy home town and it takes his son on a trip to Mississippi where Ricky has bested one of the top poker players in the world in a game of Texas Hold 'Em. Their investigations follow their own courses as they probe deeper into how one man can be so lucky and that is all you really need to know right now, except to say that you will get an education concerning the darker side of the gambling industry and be totally engrossed in the story and it's many characters until at last the truth is discovered. <br /> <br />I bought this book on a hunch that I would like it based on the revews I had seen.  That was a lucky on my part and you can get it on it too. It's a winner!!	2005-04-02

A deputy sherrif is patroling an enclave of summer homes in Lost Lake, CA when the peacefulness of the evening is shattered by a woman's scream. No one knows it at the time, but the scream is about to shatter many lives in many different ways. Responding, the deputy discovers a woman staggering from the woods surrounding the home of Congressman Eric Glass. As he approaches, the woman says, \\"He's dead...Carl killed him.\\" And thus begins a story of intrigue, suspense, murder, power and deception. Who the woman is; who Carl is and how they came to that point in time takes much of the book to tell and the rest of it to bring it to it's final resolution. <br /> <br />This lacks a half star only because I felt the closing of the story could have been more powerful, but that does not detract from the plot the author establishes and then weaves with his usual artistry in the telling of a very suspenseful story.	2005-03-31

I am continuing to read Brian Haig's Sean Drummond series in reverse order, having been very much taken with his most recent effort. In this story Drummond, a JAG officer has been assigned to represent an army officer charged with treason. Not just any old run of the mill treason, mind you, but one that sets a new standard for betraying one's country. Not just any old run of the mill officer either, but one that had attained the rank of Brigadier General. Not just any old run of the mill Brigadier General either, but one who thirteen years earlier married the love of Sean Drummond's life. Drummond is none too happy taking on this case, but his ex-lover has asked him to defend her husband and Drummond has never figured out how to say \\"no\\" to her...about anything. <br /> <br />The defense appears to be a hopeless undertaking as the prosecutor, an old nemisis, keeps laying out his case for the public in various press releases and meetings and the evidence appears to be overwhelming. But, appearances can be deceiving as we all know. <br /> <br />Drummond hires a Russian speaking associate who is easy on the eyes and who also has a sharp and agile mind. As they start to look into the case they learn things about their client that disturb them as to his character and eventually as to whether or not he is guilty of the charges.  <br /> <br />Haig creates a web of intrigue that is best left to the reader to discover. Suffice it to say that he does it in a very page turning type of way and you will not want to put the book down once things really start to come together. Haig has a special way with a story such as this and we should all be thankful that he does.	2005-03-27

On one hand, Nelson DeMille has written some of the most entertaining and readable books that I have ever come across. But, every now and then he writes a real clunker. Given the premise of the story, i.e., solving the mystery of TWA 800, I wondered how he could write believeably about this issue. Having just closed the book, I am here to tell you that he can. One really can't tell you too much about the book without giving away the contents, so you will have to take it on trust that it is a worthwhile read. DeMille has the same annoying habit that Robert Crais and Brian Haig do in having their main character getting off a number of one-liners, but that is as close to a criticisim as you are going to get from me on this effort. One suspects that there may be a sequel, but then again, probably not. After you read it you will understand what I mean. Sorry to be so mysterious, but this is a mystery story told by a master at the top of his game.	2005-03-20

Like some other reviewers, I found Brian Haig late in his writing life and am now progressing backwards through his novels. Major Sean Drummond, JAG lawyer, seems to attract trouble without looking for it. At the beginning of this story it turns out that he is a bit late for a date with with fellow JAG officer Lisa Morrow due to his being stopped for speeding. The delay turns out to be fatal to Lisa as she becomes the victim of what eventually appears to be a serial killer. At the time of the killing Drummond has just been \\"loaned\\" to a private sector law firm under the Working With Industry Program (WWIP) by his commanding officer. It was either accept the position or be sent to some remote post for a time of personal reflection and attitude adjustment. The firm is high powered, well connected and into some rather dubious dealings. They are also very demanding and imperious in their dealings with underlings. Given Drummond's temperment, he is quickly in hot water with those he has to deal with. In what at first seems to be a parallel story, we are taken into the thought process of the killer as he prepares to stalk and dispose of his next victims. As the story progresses the deaths which seems to be random and without purpose slowly start to appear to have a pattern. The unraveling of that story and how it all relates to the law firm is well done by the author and the pages turn rapidly as we are drawn into the chase and the mystery. My only complaint with the story is that I thought the ending could have had more of a dynamic to it, but overall I am more than happy to recommend it to those of you who like a good mystery and well drawn characters.	2005-03-16

This was my first exposure to the writing of Brian Haig and his character, Army JAG Major Sean Drummond. It will not be my last. <br /> <br />In partnership with Jennifer Margold, a special FBI Agent attached to the DC field office and Drummond on assignment to the CIA Office of Special Projects, are part of the team that is called to investigate the murder of the President's Chief of Staff, his wife and four of his protectors. It is clearly done by professionals and it is equally clear that they had inside information to accomplish the hit. A note is left behind which warns: \\"You can't stop us. There will be others and the President will be history in two days.\\" <br /> <br />True to their words, the killers execute other high profile Washington figures as the team struggles to find an answer as to who is behind all of this. <br /> <br />Margold and Drummond seem to be on the track and a breakthrough interview with the mother of one of the Secret Service protectors who has gone missing focuses the investigation. There are numerous wheels within wheels on the team as the various agencys and people in them move to protect their turf, sometimes to the detriment of the search. However, as the net closes on the individual being sought and more killings occur, a ransom demand is received from the perpetrators. They want 50 million dollars in untracable money to call off the killing spree. The government agrees and then the story really starts to get interesting. Drummond is the courier who is selected to deliver the money and Margold is in the FBI Agent in charge of seeing that he survives the experience. Their relationship as the story develops has bordered on the romantic, although circumstances keep it from bearing any fruit, so to speak. To tell you more concerning the problems that are thrown in the way of the delivery of the money and it's aftermath would spoil the story and this is a story that delivers all the suspense and surprises that a reader can take.  <br /><br />This is first class stuff written by an author that has a great ability to deliver dialogue so that you swear you can hear the voices involved. You will not want to put this one down, trust me.	2005-03-11

In his fifth novel featuring the art restorer and Israeli sometime assassin, Gabriel Allon, author Daniel Silva delivers another gripping chapter in the difficult life of his central character. The title comes from a comment that was made by Allon's mentor, Ari Shamron when Allon returned as a young man from his first assassination on behalf of Israel. Allon's black hair had gone gray at the temples as a result of a traumatic reaction to the event, which caused Shamron to call them \\"smudges of ash on the prince of fire.\\"    In this book, following an explosion at the Israeli embassy in Rome it is discovered that the Palestinians have uncovered Allon's identity, his bloddy past and have marked him for elimination. Moving swiftly on this news Allon is extracted from Venice and returned to Israel.    An analysis of a series of attacks that have been carried out prior to Rome reveals that a master terrorist is at work in planning and carrying them out and Allon is detailed to determine the man's identity and to track him down and eliminate him.    Too much detail in describing how the puzzle is solved and the obstacles that are put in the way would spoil the story, but suffice it to say that once the man is identified, Allon's troubles are only begining.    Silva does his usual masterful job of weaving this fictional story around the current events in the Middle East, utilizing some real characters to give weight to the tale and also educating the reader with some historical facts concerning the creation of the State of Israel and how the Palestinian problem came to be.    The good news for the reader is that there appears to be more to come, but getting current with the adventures of Gabriel Allon is quite sufficient for now.	2005-03-03

Nothing in this book changes my mind in that regard. Elvis Cole is back again and is confronted with the murder of a man who claimed to be his father. This is a subject that has haunted Cole since he was a child, however as he investigates the death of the man, he starts to unravel a story that is very dark and very dangerous. Carol Starky from Demolition Angel and The Last Detective returns and I would say is destined to keep returning in future novels, which is something to look forward to.

As the author notes at the end, it was not a thin piece of reading and to get to the end you had to stick to it. Perhaps the going was hard after an absolutely hilarious beginning because of the subject nature of the story. In any event, it is a book that will give you pause for thought the next time some \\"big story\\" is brewing on CNN, Fox or MSNBC. It will make you wonder about what is real and what is contrived. It will make you more sceptical about what passes for entertainment these days and less likely to accept anything you see at face value. The main character in the book spends most of his time manipulating people and events, yet in the end he becomes a better person, not because of any concious effort on his behalf to do that, but because he he is open and receptive to the events that swirl around him.	2005-02-23

A massive glacier is about to be carved off of Antarctica to create the world's largest iceberg, flash floods are planned to kill hundreds, if not thousands in the American Southwest and a tsunamni is being created in the South Pacific which will devestate the California coast and all in between. These three events are to coincide with a Crisis Conference on Climate, however nothing is coincidental. Things start to unravel for those bent on destruction by the sudden withdrawal of 10 million dollars worth of funding of one of the major activist environmental groups by it's prime benefactor. The withdrawal is public and ugly and he is later found to have wrecked his car on an isolated stretch of beach road and died in the accident. From this, rise an unlikely band of Lancelots to charge off into the fray and try to prevent the catastrophes from taking place. Who they are and how they go about doing it is what makes this a novel. Woven throughout the book is considerable discussion and debate about the perceived state of our world environment and how to go about dealing with it.  <br /> <br />The key chapter in the book from my perpective, takes place between Evans, the philanthropist's lawyer, one of the Lancelots and Professor Norman Hoffman a famous sociologist who is extremely critical of environmental beliefs. <br /> <br />One of his tenets is that every soverign nation needs to exert social control over the behavior of its citizens and that the best manager of social control is fear. Not earthshaking perhaps, but the dialogue that follows is something that a reader could well read and reread until it is underlined and dog eared. <br /> <br />How the storyline plays out I will leave to the reader, as this book has a larger lesson which is highlighted in a somewhat lengthy author's message at the end. <br /> <br />If you have to read only one book this year, I urge you to buy, rent or borrow this one. It is that important and you will never look at this issue the same way again.	2005-02-14

He usually deals with some facet of the legal profession and he usually spins an intriguing yarn about whatever one he has chosen. This book is neither about the legal profession nor intriguing. A Washington power broker has gone to prison in an attempt to stay alive and to protect a secret that only he knows the answer to. The CIA head arranges a pardon from an outgoing president who seems even more craven in his granting of pardons than WJC. The purpose of setting him free is to see which of several nations that are out to get him, actually kill him. Remaining in CIA \\"custody\\" he is spirited away to Italy where we spend far too much of the book following his learning of Italian and the ways of an Italian citizen. A scandal erupts back in DC about some of the president's pardons with the liklihood that at least one was arranged because of a large bribe to obtain it and his pardon is suggested to be a possibility. The broker, Joel Backman, learns of the scandal and fearing (rightly) for his life sets about to escape from his handlers and try and set things right back in Washington in order to stay alive. This is all done in a somewhat trite and predictable fashion with a trite and predictable result. Far from Grisham's best.	2005-02-07

A word of explanation to Amazon readers about \\"customer reviews.\\" Those that you find before the line that invites you to write a review are done by reviewers such as myself, who have been provided with an advance copy of the book by the publisher. They are almost always universally upbeat. You may note in the reviews that follow that the tone of them is decidedly less positive. Draw your own conclusions. <br /> <br />I had not read a Cussler novel for some time until I received this one as a Christmas present. The approach to the story is the same as always. An historic event is tied into the current story and bad guys are using the past event to do something dastardly which must be stopped and can only be stopped by Dirk Pitt and his able side kick Al Giordino. In this case the past event was a planned attack on the US by Japan during the waning days of WW2 from aircraft launched from submarines and carrying biological weapons bombs with smallpox. The submarines were destroyed before they could launch their strike, but it seems that someone is after their payload. The question is who and why? The answer is a fellow named Kang, a N. Korean who's plan is to rid the Korean peninsula of US Troops. To this end he has whipped up a frenzy in S. Korea against a US soldier who is accused of the rape and murder of a young Korean girl (he was framed by Kang) and to launch a horrendous bioloical attack on the west coast of the US using a commercial missile launch platform. He has planned it to look like Japaneese dissidents did it and to so occupy the US with the results of the attack in which millions will be affected and die, that they will not object when the S. Koreans demand that our military be withdrawn. Riding to the rescue are Pitts kids, Dirk and Summer. How they get involved and stay involved in the story is a bit tedious, but nothing is more annoying than the wise cracking that goes on throughout the book as they confront serious and life threatening situations. The senior Pitt and Al show up near the end to render some meaningful assistance to thwarting Kang's plot (this is giving nothing away) and in the end Good wins over Evil. Cussler even writes himself into the story (again) which adds little to it, but has become a Hitchcock thing he introduced several novels ago. It is a tired and somewhat contrived story line. If you enjoyed Cussler's early books you are probably not going to find this one your cup of tea. I was delighted to finish it and don't plan to repeat the experience again.	2005-02-03

Echoes of the past hang over their heads concerning the death of a SF police officer as they find themselves being drawn into the investigation of what is first thought to be a murder/suicide/arson investigation and which soon turns into a double murder/arson.  <br /> <br />Glitsky is asked to get involved by the Mayor. The only problem with that is this is not the chain of command. The Inspector in charge is not amused and in fact feels threatened by the interfearance, with interesting results.  <br /> <br />Hardy gets involved because a woman who has become the prime suspect of the police investigator assigned to the case is a former lover/friend and seeks his services when the focus of the investigation turns to her. <br /> <br />The trial that ensues is well drawn, but only part of the story is told there. To say more would reveal too much, except to say that I have no problem with how the author decided to end this story. It is true to the facts presented and true to the characters of those who carry the action. <br /> <br />I continue to wait for this author's next effort, as he has never failed to produce a compelling read.	2005-01-21

Stuart Woods in his early novels was as good as it gets in popular contemporary fiction. Unfortunately, in order to keep his bank account on the plus side, he has now resorted to wiriting formula trash and not very good trash at that. It is a disappointment to see this, but better that the reader be forewarned than to simply ignore one of the more disappointing career implosions that I have had to witness. I have abandoned hope that this will change.	2005-01-13

One - I am an unabashed James Dodson fan - I have read everything he has written and have enjoyed them all. Two - If anyone other than James Dodson had written this book, I would have never read it. Three - I am now an unabashed Ben Hogan person, because I now know the story of his life which has been told in a truthful and powerful manner. I wish I had seen more of him and I wish that when I did see him on television that I would have appreciated what I was looking at. <br /> <br />James Dodson has written several books about his own personal experiences which have been well received and rightly so, especially the book, Final Rounds, which put him on the literary map. He was also Arnold Palmer's \\"co-author\\" for his auto-biography, a pleasant book and which achieved Jim's goal of having the reader feel that he had the chance to sit down and have a few Scotches with \\"The King.\\"  <br /> <br />In this book, he is working without a net. He has accepted the challange and the honor of being the family authorized biogapher of one of the greatest golfers of all time. In recreating \\"An American Life\\" he has devoted at least three years of his life to the research necessary to marshall the facts. Then he had to take the results of his research and do justice to the lives of Ben and Valerie Hogan. No easy chore. <br /> <br />In judging how succesful he was I have to only look at my perception of Hogan before I read the book. He was basicallly a name from the past. (I am 66) His greatest accomplishments were not on TV. He was said to be aloof. A loner. A perfectionist.  <br /> <br />When he finally made it to TV, he was past his prime, but still playing well enough. He was a ghost hanging around in the early days of Palmer, Nicklaus and Player. He was a \\"black and white guy\\" in the early days of color TV. <br /> <br />James Dodson peels that all away and exposes the heart and soul of the man. He does it honestly.Warts and all. But the image that is left with the reader is one of wishing that you could have met him and if not that, watched him play at the height of his career and if not that, been able to share a lunch and a \\"see-through\\" with him at Shady Oaks. <br /> <br />If you consider yourself a golfer, you owe it to yourself to read this book. And you owe it to Ben Hogan.  <br /> <br />	2005-01-11

The book is easily read in a day. I started with the homicide set in Santa Fe and was finding it interesting until the end arrived. And that is about the way it happened. Not much explanation - some questions left hanging. I liked the relationship of the two police officers and their characters were well drawn. It was almost as though this was intended to be a full blown novel, but the author(s) ran out of steam and decided to pull the plug in the way that they did. <br /> <br />The Boston homicide story was clearly the better of the two, yet I thought that it also could have been drawn into a larger story if the authors had chosen to do so. <br /> <br />So, if you are looking for a couple of plesant little stories about homicide and have a plane ride to take or some time to curl up by the fire, I would suggest you wait for the paperback. It should be right along.	2004-12-30
409653:US	52812751	R2C2LO2YBLZSG0	0743267524	778315947	Faithful: Two Diehard Boston Red Sox Fans Chronicle the Historic 2004 Season	Books	2	10	15	N	N	Memories of the self-absorbed. A Rip Off!!	Let's set the record straight before I go any further. I have been a Red Sox fan as long as I have a memory and I will be 67 on my next birthday. I remember '67 and '75 and '86 as well as anyone and I surely remember the season of 2004.  <br /> <br />When I was given this book for Christmas I was really looking forward to reliving the most memorable of all Red Sox seasons. Having now finished it, I am left with the same sense of missed opportunity that Tony LaRussa must have felt after seeing his team swept out of the World Series. Stewart O'Nan and Stephen King are admittedly talented writers although I have never read O'Nan's works and am no great fan of King. This type of book is not their genre. In it, the story of the 2004 season often takes a back seat to their telling and retelling of their antics in snagging batting practice balls, getting autographs, caging tickets, who they saw at the games and the childish things they said and did, usually at Yankee games. If you have any plans to let your younger children read this book, you might want to review it for language. Somehow, these two talented writers have felt that in order to be \\"authentic\\" in telling their stories of the season they should leave their language salty. It adds nothing to the telling, but I assume they felt it was necessary. Basically, this book is a testament to the authors' self absorption and will add very little to one's understanding or recollection of this historic season. I recall a long time ago, when Edward Moore Kennedy was running for the U.S. Senate, that his opponant charged that \\"If your name was Edward Moore, your candidacy would be a joke.\\" I dare say that if Stewart King and Stephen O'Nan had come up with this book, it never would have seen the light of day in the publishing world. Their celebrity and wealth may get them tickets to Fenway, but it is no reason to think that they have any corner on understanding what it is that they watched.	2004-12-28

Christopher Buckley has the gift of taking a situation and writing about it in a compelling and entertaining way which delivers more truth than fiction, often to the discomfort of those whose toes are trod on the hardest. <br /> <br />A character in the book, referred to as Uncle Sam, sums up the situation that has been created well into the book quite neatly when he opines: \\"As I recall, the mission was to empower Arab women and bring about some kind of stability in the Middle East. There were those who said, 'Are you out of your mind?' Others said, 'We've tried everything else, why not give it a shot? What harm can it do??\\" Ha! And how did it all turn out? With a coup detat - and how appropriate to use the French term for it - against the only stable country in the region. Not only did it not work, but it brought about the further enslavement of two point five million Arab women, along with the empwerment of a psychotic race-car driver, to say nothing of a whopping increase in Wasabi oil prices that may well determine the outcome of the next presidential election. And did I mention France getting naval bases in the Gulf? <br /> <br />And that's far from the end of the story. <br /> <br />It's a fun ride and done so very well. Hop on and enjoy the trip.	2004-12-25

Forrester, Patrick O'Brien and James Nelson are all authors that I have enjoyed immensley and now I have Richard Woodman to add to the list. The authenticity of the description of the life on ships of war is almost too real and certainly takes some of the shine off the supposed glamour of the era. Nathaniel Drinkwater is introduced in this novel and apparently continues to grow through many of the ones that follow. That is good news as his character is interesting and complicated and it will be very interesting to watch his passage as a naval officer and a man. Woodman has a facility for putting you in the midst of the story he is telling; his characters are well drawn and the whole story, while often painful to follow, is nevertheless compelling. This is an author to follow.	2004-12-22

There must be something about the air in Florida..at least as to how it affects some of those who chose to write about the life there, i.e. Carl Hiassen and Tim Dorsey.

I love books that deal with horses. I especially look forward to those which deal with horse racing. Add to that setting a hero with some serious defects in his character, an interesting scenario which puts him on the side of the angels, several villians whom you will love to hate, some people you will genuinely care about and a generous sprinkling of serious nut cases and you have a very readable, thoroughly enjoyable first novel by John McEvoy. I have read most of the writings of the late, great Dick Francis and in my judgment, references to his writings in comparison to this story is comparing apples to oranges. Both authors have an interesting way of telling their story, but there is little comparison to how they go about it. This is a story that will hold your interest, tickle your funny bone and satisfy your sense of justice. That's a trifecta worth betting on!! <br />	2004-12-12

Bobby Reeves is such a guy. He is getting to the bottom of the barrell when he steals money from a good friend and is not only found out, but jailed for his effort. From that point on, things start looking up for Bobby. Introducing Stewart Jones, the man who walks into Bobby's life and turns it around in spades as his caddie and his counselor. Along the way Jones reveals little about who he really is directly, but the hints that are dropped are as broad as an Arnold Palmer smile. There is some interesting lore about the PGA tour dispensed, there is some good golf advice, there is some history and there is a bit of a soap opera atmosphere created as Bobby seeks his PGA Tour card and then moves on from there to much bigger and better challenges. Don't look for any sudden twists and turns of plot. This pretty much plays out to the readers satisfaction, but the story is somewhat thin, even though it is fairly entertaining.	2004-12-09

In this book about the 87th Precinct, The Deaf Man\\" has returned. I am of the opinion that a book should stand on it's own and you shouldn't have had to have read a prior novel which dealt with the same people to understand what is going on. I don't think this one measures up on that basis. The first chapter is a bit of a grabber and perhaps promises more than the book eventually delievers. The Deaf Man spends most of the book sending Shakespearean clues to the 87th Precinct which are supposed to help them figure out his next crime. Why he goes through that exercise is not clear to me and if I were you I would not get too bogged down in trying to figure out the clues. The rest of the cast of characters are in various stages of \\"being in heat\\" which is mildly entertaining. The Deaf Man's \\"sidekick\\" somewhat steals the show and is as memorable as any character in the book. If you have a plane ride in your future or plan to spend some time by the fire, this will keep you company quite nicely.	2004-12-03

It was one of the more unusual books I had read about the Civil War as it dealt with the Confederate Navy and was told from their point of view in a most riveting fashion. Since reading that book I have read all of Nelson's writings concerning Thomas Marlowe and his adventures in piracy and Isaac Biddlecomb and his adventures in the Revolutionary War, eight books in all. I have also read \\"The Only Life That Mattered\\" which involved a pirate legend and was highly entertaining.<br /><br />Reign of Iron is Nelson's first venture into non-fiction and I can assure you that nothing suffers with the change. Exhaustively researched, Nelson brings back to life the days when the navies of the two waring factions were about to move from the days of wood to the reign of iron.<br /><br />It is an important story, but one that was relegated to a supporting role in the overal panorama of the War Between the States. Now, Nelson has brought it forward, front and center and explained in detail the trials and tribulations that ushered in this dramatic change in how control of the oceans of the world evolved.<br /><br />Most of us grew up with some knowledge of The Monitor and The Merrimac, but as Nelson explains, our general knowledge was superficial and usually wrong. This is the true story and it is an important one. Fans of this author will not be disappointed.	2004-11-30

In this book, the CIA contains an element within it's operation which uses psychiatry and psychological means to target people and turn them into assassins. It is called The Artificial Assassin Program. It seems to be functioning with impunity and great success until one of it's targets proves to be more than a match for it.

Simply put, I enjoyed the book.  I found the plotting of the book along with the flash backs to explain previous action to be interesting and helpful and with so many previous books in the series, some explanation of the history of the characters is necessary for a first time reader. The depth of the plotting against the establishment and the Roman Catholic church requires some straining of credulity, but once you get in the mood of the story, it just flows along nicely.

Had I not done so, I probably would have not bought the second book, based upon my view of the first. That would have been my loss. <br /> <br />This book is loosely based on the events at Ruby Ridge and the Weaver family. Hogan clearly shows what pitfalls and difficulties await those in charge of managing such confrontations and weaves throughout it the various personalities and prejudices that are present at such confrontations. <br /> <br />John Banish is the FBI hostage negotiator in the middle of things with some skeletons in his past and something left to prove. He has to manage the various law enforcement agencies, angry residents who are sympathetic to the holed up family and others on both sides with itchy trigger fingers and short tempers. <br /> <br />This is probably much like what a hostage negotiaion is all about, but I'm not sure having read about it I find that it was really worth the effort. Go for his second book. That is a winner.	2004-11-17

In the interest of full disclosure, Mr. Ronco wrote me and asked if I would be willing to read and review this book. No promises were asked or made as to what I would say about it. My basic problem with the story is that the characters are not fleshed out very well. We find them already formed, already bent on trying to introduce PeaceMaker to the computers of the world or prevent it from happening, depending on the character. The character of Dianne is far too manic in her mood swings to be believeable, just for starters. Her motivation is said to be the humiliation she received when held in contempt by the court at the anti-trust trial involving her computer company. If so, her reaction is extreme and otherwise unexplained. The book reads more like the outline of a larger book in which there is an interesting story to tell if done right. It just does not get done very well.	2004-11-15

His ship is being built on the Delaware River below Philidelphia. What he doesn't know is that the British have taken Philidelphia and stand between him and his unfinished ship. The ship itself has been spirited away to a safe location by the shipwright who designed it and an unlikely band of deserters. As the story starts he is enroute to his new command on the brig Charlemagne, sailing with a small convoy when a British naval ship is encountered. Thinking that  the British ship is no match for them, they attack. His convoy suddenly turns turtle and the battle goes against them, which leaves them beaching the brig, fighting off the British who are sent to take them prisoner and setting off over land to find a way to the Falmouth. <br /> <br />In the initial encounter and old enemy returns, Lt. Smeaton from the Icarus, who has lost his career in His Majesty's Navy thanks to Biddlecomb and who will die a happy man if he can kill him. Smeaton is bested in the first encounter, but the two shall meet again. (and again) <br /> <br />The story turns between the efforts to save the Falmouth and Biddlecomb's need to find it and assume command, all of which come to a cresendo at the end of the book. The pace of action and intrigue have not slipped in this fifth book and there is much of the Revolution at Sea to come, one thinks. That is good news indeed.	2004-11-14

The trilogy now becomes a \\"saga\\" with the fourth in the series of The Revolution at Sea as Nelson continues with his perspective on the American Revolution, mostly from the quarter deck of various ships. In this case it is, for the most part, the US Navy brig Charlemagne commanded by Capt. Isaac Biddlecomb. The choice of that name for a hero is of interest, as such a name sounds as though he might be happier laboring over ledgers in some accounting firm. However, Biddlecomb is a name known by many of the British officers who have crossed his path and all of whom would love to see him swinging from a yardarm or run through by their blade. Early in the book he helps General Washington out of a tough spot by providing sufficient boats (from the British Navy) to allow him to escape from a certain pounding on Long Island. It seems that Washington's bacon is often being saved by Biddlecomb in these stories. Following that, he receives an order to transport Dr. Benjamin Franklin to France. In order to do that, he must cross the ocean eluding the British Navy, following which he finds himself free to raise a bit of hell off the coast of England. The predicaments that he finds himself in are well wrapped in the historical context of the times. We all learn a bit more about Franklin's work to bring the French out of neutrality on the side of the United States and we also learn that while a cat may have nine lives, Biddlecomb has far surpassed that. <br /> <br />Nelson writes with a sure hand about the little things of sailing in those days as well as the grand sweep of history and the reader is carried along with an intriguing look at those very important times.	2004-11-14

Nelson returns to his Revolution at Sea saga with a story that is likely to cost you some sleep, but will repay you with much entertainment and enlightenment. Captain Isaac Biddlecomb is about to resign from the Rhode Island naval command of the brig Charlemagne. His sailing has been reduced to running a \\"cattle ferry\\" as he calls it, removing cattle from the islands in the area in order to deny the British sailors fresh meat. His feelings about the conflict growing with the British are ambivalent except for the effect it has had on his ability to perform as a merchant captain. He also has memories of his adventures in the first book of the saga. As he explains to his friend Ezra Rumstick, he has enough blood on his hands, not that he minds killing an enemy that is trying to kill him, \\"...but I can't and won't lead any more men to slaughter.\\" <br /> <br />That is about to change. <br /> <br />General George Washington has discovered that his troops in Boston are frightfully short on gun powder and a plan is hatched to sail a ship to Bermuda where a store of gun powder is available which can be acquired without much difficulty. Biddlecomb is offered a Captain's commission in the Army of the United Colonies to undertake the mission which he accepts with reluctance.  <br /> <br />Unbeknownst to those few who planned the operation, save one, Biddlecomb is saililng into a British trap. <br /> <br />He and his ship are captured and are in the process of being returned to Boston as a part of a large convoy of British merchantmen and protecting warships when the story really starts to get interesting. <br /> <br />While awaiting the convoy, Biddlecomb is permitted to write a letter to his \\"fiancee\\" in Rhode Island. It is reviewed by the British captain who has captured him and allowed to be sent. In truth he has deduced that there is a traitor who helped plan the operation and his letter is a riddle to those who receive and read it, until its true nature is \\"smoked out\\" andthe story branches onto two tracks. Those in the colonies discovering who the traitor is and how Biddlestone can escape from his predicament. <br /> <br />Those two story lines are well drawn, full of suspense, action, and drama that will make your further reading of the sage both rewarding and entertaining. Nelson has a way of painting his main character into corners. They have a way of wiggling out of them. He has a flair for the history of the time and a knowledge of sailing that gives authenticity to all of the naval action. <br />With two books of the saga behind him, one can only look forward to the next installment with great anticipation. <br /> <br />	2004-11-05

This is the first book in what was originally concieved as the Revolution At Sea trilogy, but has now been extended to at least five books and entitled a \\"Saga\\". Well, if the story found in the first book is representitive of what is to follow, a saga it surely will be.  <br /> <br />Isaac Biddlecomb is the captain of the Judea as the story begins on New Year's Eve in 1775. Returning from a successful smuggling run to Barbados they are about to enter Bristol Harbor when they encounter the HMS Rose, a British Man of War sent by King George to enforce tariffs and suppress smugging. Badly damaged he decides  to send his ship into the coastal rocks in order to escape and thereby sacrifices his ship and the fortune she was carring. <br /> <br />The Rose is commanded by Captain James Wallace who sets out to find and arrest Isaac in order to make an example of him. That action leads to a series of encounters and escapes by Biddlecomb that eventually finds him pressed into service on a British ship wheich turns out to be a true living hell until circumstances occur which place him in command of the British ship and bound for another encounter with Captain Wallace. <br /> <br />Nelson writes strongly and convincingly of the times in colonial America and identifies the emerging desire for independence among its people as well as giving identity to those who would have kept us loyal to the king. This is a fast moving story, packed with adventure at sea, violence, intrigue and suspense. It is a very promising start for what looks to be a terrific series of reads.	2004-11-03

We have now advanced to 1706 in the final book of the trilogy, Bretheren of the Coast involving Thomas Marlowe.  Marlowe having left his former life as a pirate, changed his name and found respectability as a tobacco plantation owner is about to be visited by his past again. War in Europe has made shipping tobacco there far less profitable than in the past and due to piracy the tobacco owners liked to send their crops in one large convoy which resulted in a glut on the market when it landed and <br />raised havoc with their profits. It is Elizabeth who comes up with the idea of refitting their former private man-of war and shipping their tobacco ahead of the convoy, thereby fetching a fair price to and helping them avoid financil ruin. Marlowe, who has been too long without having a quarterdeck under his feet, jumps at the idea and also has another thought in the back of his mind, as he is aware of the stories coming back across the water of new opportunities for those who are willing to sail to the Indian Ocean to prey upon the treasure ships of the great Mogul of India. <br /> <br />Once again, Marlowe's past returns to haunt him when they get their crop to England and Marlowe is required to come ashore in London to sign for the crops of neighbors which he had carried and is confronted by Roger Press, a former pirate whom Marlowe had thought was dead. Marlowe had marooned him and left him to die in the Caribeean several years before.  Press has been hired by the East India Company, been given a man-of-war and a Queen's Commission to hunt pirates and stop the plundering of the company's shipping. Upon discovering Marlowe, Press attempts to abduct him and plans to kill him. Marlowe escapes with his ship and his life, but without funds from the cargo of tobacco they cannot return home and a decision is arrived at to head for the Indian Ocean and the riches that can be found there in the \\"sweet life.\\" <br /> <br />From that point on the story gets into the life of ThePirate Round in full measure. The intrigues, villians, battles and the like keep building to an epic finish and from it all, Thomas Marlowe finds an answer to one of life's questions that we all can learn from.  <br /> <br />James Nelson has told a wonderful, entertaining and often bittersweet tale of the times and life among The Bretheren of the Coast, and this last book is the best of the three.	2004-11-01

Nelson has a penchant for putting his characters in a pickle. This is the second book of the Brethren of the Coast Trilogy. We have advanced in time to June of 1702 and Thomas Marlowe and Elizabeth are married. Marlowe is about to observe the final fitting out of his new private man-of-war, the Elizabeth Galley and he is also about to receive a private letter of marque from the governor. War with Spain has erupted and a letter of marque gives the holder the right to sieze and take the ships of the enemy. It is legalized priacy and fits Thomas Marlowe, former pirate in another life to a tee. <br /> <br />In the previous book, Marlowe purchased the estate of James Tinling and after doing so, freed the slaves thereon, not so much out of ideology, but out of a realization that they would be more productive as paid laborers in harvesting his tobacco crop and less trouble. It was a decision which did not sit well with his neighbors. It particularly did not sit well with a new arrival to the area, one Fredrick Dunmore who has been agitating for laws to make the lives of freed slaves as miserable as possible. <br /> <br />Dunmore seems to be more of a nuisance than a threat until King James, one of Marlowe's freed slaves and commander of this sloop Northumberland, is sailing down the James River to Point Comfort with a load of building materials for the house he is about to have built for himself and his new wife. In doing so they encounter a ship in distress and on boarding it they discover that it is a slaveship, a \\"Blackbirder\\" which was attacked by pirates and left in woeful condition. King James recalls his time as a slave on such a ship and when he is met with hostility and aggression by the captain of the ship a fight breaks out and the captain and several of the crew are killed. James realizes that he cannot return and takes command of the ship, sending one of his crew back to tell Marlowe what has happened. When the door is opened and Sam is seen standingthere, torn clothes, shirt smeared with blood and vomit and his eyes wild, Marlowe knows that his life has just changed, even before a word is uttered. <br /> <br />In a meeting with the governor, Marlowe is denied his letter of marque until he takes his ship and kills or captures King James. The governor takes the position that Marlowe has set the example of freeing the slaves and it puts them all in danger of their slaves rising up against them. The guns on Marlowe's ship were salvaged from the former Guardship commanded by Marlowe and the governor considers them the proprty of the colony and reasons that they need to be used to protect them from the dangers that Marlowe has exposed them to. Angry and resentful, Marlowe accepts the task as the only way to keep his ship and eventually be allowed to sail it as a privateer.   <br /> <br />As Marlowe goes in search of James, Dunmore takes his absence as an opportunity to attempt to capture and imprison his freed slaves. Elizabeth takes up that challange with help from an old friend which leads them to Boston to discover the reasons for Dunmore's obsession with Negroes. <br /> <br />Meanwhile King James is dealing with a myriad of problems in the running of the former slave ship and there is treachery afoot there as well. <br /> <br />Marlowe continues his quest to kill or capture James and as I said at the beginning, Nelson does a wonderful job of putting his characters in a real pickle and how these issues are resolved makes for entertaining and sometimes agonizing reading as the story unfolds. <br /> <br />Nelson writes with gripping realisim, keeps his characters true to themselves and once again delivers a tale that will hold one's interest to the end. The third book awaits and I am looking forward to it.	2004-10-29

The place is Williamsburg, Virginia Colony. The month is April. Thomas Marlowe, recently arrived from England and the purchaser of the estate property of the late Joeseph Tinling, is attending a dance, all of which seems harmless enough, but events that transpire that night will set him on a path that will affect the lives of the community and the fortunes of many. Elizabeth Tinling, 23 and already two years a widow is in attendance at the dance and is being roughly pursued by Matthew Wilkenson, the younger of two brothers of one of the most powerful families in Viginia. In attempting to remove her from the unwanted advances of Wilkenson, an insult is hurled at Marlowe, the type of which in those days required \\"satisfaction.\\" A duel is arranged. Wilkenson is shot dead and Marlowe's \\"respectable life\\" is turned upside down. Prior to the matter with Wilkenson and Elizabeth, the Governor has urged Marlowe to accept the captaincy of The Guardship, a decrepit English Man of War that is intended to guard colnial shipping from the pirates that prey along the coast. Her captain is a scoundrel who is loathe to put his men to action and who also has his hand in the cookie jar of the coastal trade. Marlowe assumes command by force and wonders if the prize is worth the keeping once he sees the condition of H.M.S. Plymouth Prize and the state of her crew. After repairs and drills, he manages to wage a suprize attack on a pirate stronghold which earns him great favor back home, except from the Wilkenson clan, who are bent on using their power and prestige to ruin Marlowe as well as Elizabeth. There are numerous memorable characters who populate this first book of a trilogy. Jean-Pierre LeRois is certainly high on the list. A quite mad pirate captain, he has decided to stake out the Chesapeake Bay area as his hunting ground which of necessity draws him into conflict with Marlowe and as that occurs, we learn that they know each other from another place in time. King James, an African slave was the property of James Tinling. When Marlowe acquired the Tinling property he freed the slaves and put them to work on the tobacco crop. King James was brought into the house to run it and was also given command of The Northumberland, Marlowe's private sloop. Throughout the remainder of the book, Marlowe has to deal with the plots of the Wilkenson's and the raiding of the pirate, Le Rois. In so doing he is tested as never before in his life and is also forced to confront who he was and who he has become. This is a powerful adventure story which will keep you turning pages, enjoying the tale and looking forward to the next installment.ng James, an African slave was the property of James Tinling.

There is magic in James Nelson's imagination. In this instance, he has taken the outline of a true story concerning the last days of piracy and brought it to life in a most entertaining and emminently readable novel. I used to think that C.S. Forrester was the best at making the days of sail come alive. Having been a professional square-rig sailor, Nelson and his talent for story telling are at least on a par with Forrester and that is rarified company. The story of Anne Bonny, Mary Read and Calico Jack starts very near the end. They have been captured and are about to be put on trial as pirates. The story then goes back to trace the ladies lives to the point where they end up on the deck of the Pretty Anne captained by Calico Jack Rackam and then moves forward through time to reach their imprisonment and trial. It is a lusty tale, full of life, bawdy, bloody and lived to the full. If you have read no other Nelson tales, this is a great one to start with. I am sure it will whet your appetite for his other books. The man is a master story teller and we are the beneficiaries.	2004-10-23

It is always a pleasant suprise to buy a book on a hunch and find that it was your lucky day. I had not heard of Chuck Hogan or of the other two books he has written, but on the strength of this novel, I have ordered them both. Doug MacRay is a product of Charlestown, Massachusetts which according to a character in the book \\"produces more bank robbers and armored car thieves than any other square mile in the world.\\" Doug is both and the brains of a crew of thieves who are about to pull off a Morning Glory and a Jack in the Box robbery as the story begins. They have broken into the bank from a room above it and are awaiting the arrival of the branch manager to open the bank in the morning, hence the term of art to describe their methods. In casing the bank before robbing it, Doug has staked out the manager's apartment, followed her many places and has become attracted to the woman in a way that will lead him into  a realtionship which has peril for both of them and for others as well. The crafting of this story is masterful. You will get to know the characters, you can hear their voices, feel for their problems and fear for their lives. I had thought that Dennis Lehaine had written the penultimate story obout this area of Boston. But, I had not met The Prince of Thieves. This is the best.	2004-10-18

Jack Austin is back, with a wife and child now and has started to ramp up his game. Ten years on the Tour and no wins as he readies for The Memorial Tournament in Ohio, hosted by Jack Nicklaus. If only all he had to worry about was the other competitors. <br /> <br />A friend of his on tour, Grant Ashley has married. His wife Lynn acts oddly when being interviewed by Jack's wife for a piece on golf wives and then goes missing. She turns up in the company of Jack's agent, Jim Dempsey. Jim also represents Grant. Grant's new caddy appears stoned during a practice round and later is murdered. Dempsey is leaving his wife and family for Lynn. Nothing seems to make sense. It's the sort of thing which can be very distracting when you are trying to beat Tiger Woods. As Austin summarizes: \\"A woman in Texas was trying to understand why her husband left her and was desperate enough to ask me, a friend of her husband...one she had met only a handful of times. Grant Ashley was alone. Lynne Ashley had been exploited and very likely had, in turn, exploited Jim Dempsey. Mike Easley had been stabbed in the back.\\" Talk about your distractions. <br /> <br />The nice thing about this book is that while stories such as this which try to live in the present with real people as a part of it, especially which deal with sports, often don't work; this book works very well indeed. <br /> <br />The relationships are believeable, the charactersare well drawn, the dialogue is tightly written, the action both on and off the golf course feels authentic and you are kept happily turning pages until the last page when Austin faces a crucial last putt. <br /> <br />Whether it falls or not, there is surely more to come in the adventures of Jack Austin and that is good news for the fans of his novels. If you haven't found this author yet, this would be a good one to start with.  <br /><br />	2004-10-12

Theresa Mendoza is The Queen of the South and Arturo Perez-Reverte is the King of Great Story Tellers. This is a work of fiction which reads like fact and will hold the reader from page one to page four hundred thirty six. The story revolves around the international drug trade with all of its seaminess, danger and excess. It is about loyalty, betrayal, and intrigue and is as good a book as you will read all year. As the story opens a cell phone is ringing and the fact that it is tells Mendoza that she  has to run for her life. The phone was given to her by her boyfriend who was called \\"the king of the short runways\\" due to his ability to take a small plane loaded with cocaine off a runway of less than a thousand feet.

I am delighted that I did and very rewarded. General Tommy Franks certainly did not start out in life to be the man he has become. Being a soldier was not even on his radar screen until his interest in fast cars, the opposite sex and alcohol superceded his interest in studying at the University of Texas and was advised by the authorities that he would not be readmitted after being on academic probation for a year. He could reapply in six months. As Franks himself puts it, \\"I was too spoiled, unfocused and immature to get much out of college. I had a lot of growing up to do.\\" Enlisting in the Army, he started the process of growing up and finding himself. His story of going from an enlisted man to Officer Candidate School and rising through the ranks is both interesting and inspiring. His story gets most interesting as he recounts his adventures as Commander of Central Command (CENCOM) and the waging of the War on Terrorisim in Afghanistan and Iraq. It is told from the point of view of a man who does not suffer fools well and who has seen the problems that can occur when politicians and generals try to micromanage a war. He fought in a war like that also - Viet Nam. Lessons were learned and remembered. Franks gives the reader insights into many of the names in the headlines and also how the media misreports what is happening on the battlefield and in the area of the war. He holds strong opinions and he is willing to share them. This is not your usual autobiography. It speaks to the reader, it educates, it inspires and it puts matters into focus. Focus is something we all need in these times. In reponse to the question he is frequently asked, i.e. is the price America is paying in blood in the war on terrorisim worth it, he has an answer that we should all listen to. \\"Of course.\\" he says. \\"I defer to no man in my love of troopers. I consider myself a soldier. But it has often been necessary in our nation's history to fight for our freedoms, and it's never been more necessary than today. It seems to me that fighting terrorisim has more to do with our kids and grandkids than with us.\\" <br /> <br />Interviewers sometimes ask the question, \\"If you could have a meal with anyone in the world, who would you pick?\\" General Franks would be on my short list. This is an important book, written by a serious and principled man. It is worth your time to read it.	2004-10-02

This was my first experience with a David Ellis novel and it left me enthralled. The story is complex and complicated and takes a while to gather steam, but once all the elements have been brought to bear it is an absolute can not put it down read. <br />It is hard to tell too much about the story without giving away some of the many twists and turns in the plot. The basic story line is that a young woman lawyer who is a children's rights advocate finds herself representing a former client who is charged with the murder of a police officer. The case seems relatively straight forward from the prosecutions's point of view and difficult to defend. But in this tale, things are seldom what they seem. The characters are well drawn and the dialogue is written so well you can hear the voices. Couple that with an outstanding plot and you have a hard to beat combination. <br />David Ellis has written a legal thriller that is all of that and a bit more.	2004-09-19

The antagonist is Raymond Thorne, an international killer with a vast plan of conspiracy and conquest that is revealed slowly as the pages turn.

John Edwards recently offerred up some advice that he probably would just have soon not given now when he said, \\"To really understand John Kerry you have to listen to those who served with him in Vietnam.\\" Well, a group which calls themselves, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth has issued a scathing and damning indictment of Senator Kerry's fitness to assume the office of President. To them the issue is one of fitness and character and in painstaking detail they chronicle the events from the past; his brief four month stint in Vietnam with the attendant claims of meritorious service; his anti-war activity upon his return to the United States; his collaboration with the enemy; the book he wrote and will now not authorise it being republished and on and on. <br /> <br />I had never paid much attention to John Kerry other than to realize that he was a United States Senator from neighboring Massachusetts who appearred on the Imus in the Morning radio show from time to time, had married John Heinz's widow and who was a solid vote for the liberal agenda, but never seemed to be leading on issues. He was a supporter, not a leader from my perspective.  <br /> <br />Then came the Democratic Primary for the presidential nomination and  the spotlight turned on Kerry as other challengers fell by the wayside or imploded. <br /> <br />It was that spotlight and the liklihood that he would get the nomination that spawned this book. It's author had been a Kerry critic ever since Kerry started his anti-war activities. The Swift Boat Veterans for Truth was more recently formed to tell what they claim is the true story of Kerry's activities in Vietnam.  <br /> <br />This is not a book which is a hasitly thrown together bunch of opinions and recolllections. It is well researched, heavily footnoted and documented and very believable. That Kerry has not personally come forth to refute their allegations, that he will not release his medical records or authorize the release of his ENTIRE militaryrecord, that his campaign acknowledges the truth of some of the claims the book makes in the most grudging way only serves to bolster their claims and their concerns for the future should he ever assume the presidency. <br /> <br />Those that support Kerry and have not read the book dismiss it as political propoganda. Some in the media have castigated those who have spoken out without even giving the book a look. This book deserves to be read and then the reader/voter can make his or her own judgments about Kerry's fitness for command. This is not political theater - it is deadly serious business - for all of us.	2004-08-28

Peter Newman and his wife Rachel, who one would have thought were murdered in a yacht explosion near the end of the first book, are alive and well and living in Jerusalem - under assumed names and in grave danger thanks to a traitorous FBI agent. General Kumulakov, a villian from the first book has also survived and re-enters the Newman's lives in a most unpleasant way.

The traitor could be a huge political liability to him. <br /> <br />Kumulakov believes that Newman can identify and eliminate the agent if properly motivated, so he has Rachel kidnapped. The price of her freedom is Newman's compliance. The kidnapping also snared a neighbor of Rachael's, Dyan Rotem who's husband Ze'em is a major in the Israeli Defense Forces.  <br /> <br />The kidnapping takes place shortly after Newman agrees to accept an assignment from the head of Gen. Grisham, the head of CENTCOM to be involved with locating three nuclear war heads that Iraq had purchased from Kumulakov and an associate and which were hidden in Iraq. Not even Sadaam or his sons can find them as the man that hid them was murdered by them. <br /> <br />So, the story takes on the task of finding the nukes and rescuing the women and how that weaves together is fascinating stuff. This is fiction that reads a lot like what has been happening in the world. It is clear that Madeline Albright will probably not appreciate her role in the story, but the vignettes in which she appears are classic. <br /> <br />If the third installment improves as much as the second did, it will be well worth waiting for.	2004-08-14

I am currently reading the 2nd book and can report that it is much more smoothly written than the first, but that reading the first was helpful. Oliver North certainly knows from first hand experience the perspective that Major Peter Newman, USMC brings to his job at the National Security Council, because Newman is the first person to hold the position that North used to have since the Iran-Conta dust up. Newman is put in charge of a covert UN force who  are authorised to bring to justice international lawbreakers. His immediate superior, the president's NSA as a deceitful SOB who is in league with a former Russian KGB agent and general who is now a Deputy Secretary General at the UN. He is also involved with selling nuclear weapons to Iraq, among other things, and it is the Iraq factor that leads to the deliberate sabotaging of Newman's mission to Iraq, by both of Newman's supervisors.  <br /> <br />The timing of the novel is set during Clinton administration and if you are a fan of that group, this story will go down with some difficulty for you as there is little to be proud of in the way the US government conducts itself. The claim that Sandy Berger was stuffing classified documents into his pants in order to remove them from the National Archieves is child's play, compared to the activities of the NSA in this novel. There is, as others have noted, a heavy dose of Christian evangalisim in parts of the book. It is part of the plotline and gives the rationale for some of the actions that take place. It could have been done with a lighter hand, but I did not find it offensive or distracting. All in all, I was glad I read it as necessary homework for the books that follow. You get the names of the players and the background for the story's framework. There is a bit of the Tom Clancy urge to overdescribe some aspects of things that don't really advance the story.	2004-08-13

I had come to expect a certain type of novel from this author (one that gives you trouble sleeping) and was delighted to find that he is much more than a one trick pony. In Garden of Beasts, Deaver takes us back to 1936 and I mean he takes us back. Edward R. Murrow used to have a television show, as I recall, entitled &quot;You are There.&quot; in which the viewer was taken back to an historic event. Well, after reading this book, you will have a pretty clear picture of Germany in the days of the Hitler ascendancy. It is not a pretty picture.  <br />  <br /> Paul Schumann, a NY mob hitman is given the choice of going to prison or traveling to Germany to asassinate one of Hitlers most important ministers. If he does so and makes his way out, he is promised money and a new life by our government. Shumann opts for a future which does not involve prison. <br />  <br /> Traveling as a reporter to the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, Schumann is not even off the boat before things start happening which complicate his life and his task. And it just keeps getting more complicated. Let Deaver take you by the hand as you traverse the Garden of Beasts. You will hate to put the book down, look forward to returning to the story and will appreciate the well thought out ending.	2004-08-05

Dr. Chaz Perrone is a biologist who is looking for a short cut to the finish line of a life of liesure and thinks he has found it working for the State of Florida and checking the water of the Everglades. The area he is in charge of is in some difficulty thanks to the agri-businesses of Red Hammernut who are polluting the Everglades in a major way. Red has Chaz on his payroll to make sure that the water samples he takes do not show any problems. It is a very cozy and profitable relationship for Chaz until he believes that his lovely wife, Joey, has learned what he is doing and the thought of losing the largesse of his benefactor drives Chaz to a desperate act which sets in motion a series of events as only Hiassen can write them. On their second anniversary Chaz and Joey are on a cruise and during a moonlight stroll on deck, Joey finds herself tossed off the ship. Her last thought before hitting the ocean is &quot;I married an a--hole.&quot; The fall alone might have killed her, but Joey was a champion swimmer during her college days and she turns the fall into a dive and then manages to survive by clinging to a bale of marijuana until she is rescued by a former cop, Mick Stranahan, who is living on a remote island. The remainder of the book involves Joey's desire to see that her husband pays dearly for trying to kill her, but not in the traditional sense. There are many quirky characters and some ingenious and hillarious goings on. It is pure Hiassen and will satisfy his many loyal fans.	2004-07-25

After purchasing the Newfoundland schooner from Hell, badly misnamed as Happy Adventure, he finds he has a boat that leaks constantly, has a compass that doesn't know where magnetic north is, hates to head West, has an engine that works when it feels like it and that is just for starters. Much of the time sailing is in the fog, both real and  self imposed. Most sane men would have turned this boat into kindling, but Mowat sailors on, one harrowing experience after another with an assortment of mates and in the process tells us a funny and true story of his adventures as only he can.

During that epic event she was a longline swordfishing captain on the Hannah Bowden and while the book was not about her, she played a significant role in the story. Later she introduced herself to us in her first book, The Hungry Ocean where she told us of her history and experiences in one of the most dangerous professions a person could chose. In her second book, The Lobster Chronicles, she has &quot;retired&quot; from swordfishing and is living with her parents on The Isle au Haut while she goes about the coastal business of lobstering with her Dad as her sternman and also goes about the business of adjusting her life to that of a successful author and recorder of the life and times of that place off the Maine Coast. <br />In her third literary effort, Lindaw recounts a very long &quot;lunch&quot; with her best friend, Alden Leeman. However, it is much more than that. Leeman is recovering from heart surgery, Greenlaw is worried about his insistence on continuing to be a commercial fisherman. As she points out, &quot;Fishing is not what Alden does for a living, it is what he is.&quot; He is also stubborn, profane, a curmudgeon and a person you can count on when the sea is rough and the wind is coming from a bad quarter.<br />The &quot;lunch&quot; takes place in a Portland watering hole namewd the Dry Dock. During the course of it, which lasts until closing time, yarns are spun, stories swapped, lies told, memories churned and lessons are taught and sometimes ignored by those hearing them. The purpose of the lunch was to get Alden to slow down or even consider retiring from fishing. The result of it was a chatty and interesting book which those who have liked Greenlaws's writing will appreciate. It is a little thin, in my judgement for the price, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it, for I did. She has been promising us a novel about the sea, drawn from her experiences for a couplke of books now. Whether or not that will happen is still in the wind, but her insights into the personal condition and the hearts of those who go down to the sea should be a wonderful framework for the effort, when it is ever undertaken.	2004-07-15

In this one, he has written a classic. It has a melange of elements. A murder trial - political intrigue at the highest levels - romance - mystery - danger and suspense. All stirred together along with some very interesting political philosophy and social commentary it becomes a very difficult book to put down and one you will reflect on after the last page is turned.<br />No need to recount the plot as others have already done so. There are many interesting characters and some lively trial scenes as Joseph Antonelli defends an old friend charged with a decades old murder. But, it is the larger story that is being told that will hold your interest and what makes this such a memorable book.	2004-07-14

In fact, the golf is very much a side piece to the book. It is much more of a comment on the foibles of our governments, the media that cover them and what motivates both told in very biting satire. The structure of the story is interesting. In the first section of the book we read &quot;the beginning of the story.&quot; In the second part we are told the &quot;end of the story.&quot; At the end we are told &quot;the middle of the story.&quot; Of course, it is the middle that makes all the rest understandable.<br />Some of the characters of the book are very entertaining, perhaps none more so than the GNN &quot;war correspondent&quot; Mona Bertram who might just remind you a wee bit of CNN's &quot;war chick&quot;, Christiana Amanpor. <br />To outline the story here would spoil the read. It is a clever effort and sometimes it is a bit too clever. Other times it hits home with some truths that make you pause. When the Secretary of Homeland Security is asked by the president's chief of staff if he can help in a situation, it is pointed out that he &quot;was happy to do anything, as his was a thankless a job as any to be found on the planet and he was always on the lookout for things, however small, that might earn him some recognition or gratitude. Like people who cleaned toilets or maintained computers, his success was utterly dependant on absolutely nothing bad happening, and when it didn't, nobody noticed. It was only when the plumbing backed up or the operating system wiped itself out or a building got blown up that anyone paid any attention and then all manner of hell would pour down and the trouble free years to that point wouldn't even be a rounding error in the balancing of recriminatory accounts.&quot; <br />Eddie is more fun when doing his thing on the golf course and hopefully he will be returned there for the next effort.	2004-07-06

They work out a tenuous and sometimes tense relationship with the detectives who are in charge of the investigation, yet little or no progress in finding the little girl occurs. At the half way point in the book, Patrick summarizes what they have accomplished (or not). &quot;This was one of the most infuriating cases I'd ever worked. Absolutely nothing made sense. A four year old girl disappears. Investigation leads us to believe that the child was kidnapped by drug dealers  who'd been ripped off by the mother. A ransom demand for the stolen money arrives from a woman who seems to work for the drug dealers. The ransom drop is an ambush. The drug dealers are killed. One of the drug dealers may or may not be an undercover operative for the federal government. The missing girl remains missing or at the bottom of a quarry.&quot;  <br />As it turns out, the answers are hiding in plain sight, yet it takes time, lives and luck to eventually come up with them. <br />This is no Mystic River (few are) but, it is a good story, well told.	2004-07-01

South Phildelphia lawyer Victor Carl is the narrator, but this has little to do with being a Grisham type novel. This is Mystic River moves to South Philly. It all starts with Joey Cheaps getting his throat slashed. Joey leaves the world the way he lived in it, owing everyone in sight, including Carl. Hours before his death Joey had met with Victor Carl and as Carl put it, &quot;...Joey Cheaps had given me something. It was something I didn't want, something I had no use for, but he had given it to me all the same. He had given me a murder.&quot; As Carl recounts Joey's tale of a twenty year old murder he also reveals a part of himself and his loyalty to a client. That loyalty in Victor Carl's world means &quot;in a world where every person has turned against him there is one person who will fight by his side as long as there is a battle to be fought. And the final battle, far as I could see, was just beginning.&quot; Truer words were never put to paper.<br />Carl's search for Joey's killer leads down many paths and to many interesting a bizarre characters. Halfway through the book he notes, &quot;I had gotten in the middle of something, of which I didn't have the first clue.&quot; Right again.<br />The story unwinds like the peeling of an onion and glimpses of the answer show for a moment and then the story turns in another direction. However, no matter what direction it takes, the reader has signed on for the duration and the answer when it comes, is well worth the trip. <br />On a personal note, I came by this book through the generosity of a lady who has read my reviews and found them useful. Her husband had started the book, but found it not to his liking and declined to finish it. She offered to send it to me to see what I thought of it. Well, I am delighted she did and I would be more than happy to return it so that she might read it or her husband might give it a second chance. I found it fascinating and I hope you will also.	2004-06-25

This is the 16th sequel to that book and as much as I hate to say so, this &quot;dog&quot; doesn't hunt very well. The premise of the story requires a suspension of belief - Russia has been taken over by a crazed general who launches a pre-emptive strike against the US using bombers and missiles which knock out most of our strike capability in the western half of the US. Patrick McClanahan, the Peck's bad boy of the USAF has been demoted to an intelligence role and even there deduces the liklihood of the attack, only to be rebuffed by the higher ups who hold him responsible for all of the stuff that has happended in the previous 15 novels which have raised holy hell all over the world. <br />Brown is suffering from Clancyitus in much of the book as he describes weapoms systems and procedures to an extent which is not necessary to appreciate the story. I'll admit that once McClanahan takes his Battle Mountain group to Russia to revenge the attack and make things right that it at least gets a bit more upbeat, but it is all fairly predictable and the end of the book suggests that this is not the end of the series. It was a great ride for a long time, but it is time to put the Old Dog story in the hanger, in my humble opinion.	2004-06-21

That does not do her writing justice. As does Russo, her writing gets way under your skin and eventually into your heart. Others have outlined the coming together of Hank &amp; Chloe.

Liking it (but not in the Mystic River class) I figured I should go back to the first in the series and work my way forward. Frankly, I found this effort to be disappointing and not up to the standards that the author is capable of.<br />Kenzie and Gennaro are big into the wise cracks and dark humor, but the matter they are dealing with is both serious and deadly. Both are in a position to be killed in the book, yet the yuks and remarks keep flowing along with a lot of very violent action, including the cold blooded murder of a gang leader who truly deserved it - by Kenzie and Gennaro.<br />There is some telling social commentary about the type of justice that one gets in Boston based upon skin color and a fairly accurate description of the kind of politicians who populate the Golden Dome on Beacon Hill. There is also a pretty good puzzle to be solved, but the way the story is told didn't ring true to me.	2004-06-06

My first Lehane experience was Mystic River which, in my opinion, is a stand alone classic. This is a different breed of cat, but an interesting one, nonetheless.<br />Kenzie has helped a young woman who claimed that a man from her gym was stalking her and that he had in fact trashed her car. This matter is easily set right by Kenzie and his side-kick and protector, Bubba Rogowski. A few months later the young lady jumps naked from the 24th story of the Custom House Tower in Boston. Kenzie feels some moral responsibility to look in to the matter as he had neglected to return a call from the woman before heading of to Bermuda with a tempoary romantic interest and when he got back he had forgotten to call.<br />His looking into the matter sets him on a chilling course of events which are better read than described here. Kenzie/Gennaro/Rodowski make a formidable and somewhat entertaining team, although some of the diologue and situations strain credulity a bit. All in all, a read that you will enjoy and be reluctant to put down until the rather twisted ending is revealed.	2004-06-03

Danny cannot say no, although he asks himself a question at the end of the meeting which he should have answered and saved himself a lot of toil and trouble. He notes that Belzer is traveling with three body guards and as he leaves the meeting he asks himself, &quot;What kind of lawyer has bodyguards?&quot;<br />Danny starts his investigation and strikes some early paydirt which Belzer approves of and which leads him to ask him to go to Rome to follow up on information he has dug up.

I had not read this author before receiving an unsolicited ARE (Advanced Reader Edition) from the publisher with an invitation to read it and review it. I was aware of her and wondered if her works were like Janet Evanovitch with her Stephanie Plum novels, which are light and frothy chick detective novels. Scottoline, in my opinion, delivers a more hefty effort. The story is interesting, the mystery takes some time to unravel, the characters are well drawn and when the plot turns dangerous it gets a bit compelling as well. Add to that the information contained in the book about the Italian American internment camps and you have a bit of a learning experience also. A pretty interesting mix.	2004-06-02

I have liked most of Michael Connelly's novels, but until this one, I always thought The Poet was his best. With this one, building upon that novel, Connelly has out done himself. Harry Bosch has agreed to look into the death of a good friend at the request of the widow. Everyone thinks it was a heart attack. Through careful sleuthing, Bosch comes up with a scenario which suggests murder, but no obvious reason or suspect. In the meantime FBI agent Rachel Walling, last seen in The Poet, has been drawn back into another search for the serial killer, whom all thought dead. The Poet was her mentor as an FBI agent and he clearly has plans for more killing. As the story moves between Walling and Bosch the lines of the story intersect and Bosch and Walling, while dealing with FBI higher ups that make your teeth hurt, follow the clues and find the truth.

Dennis Lehane has a way with character development, plotting and diologue that is pure pleasure to read. His characters come alive, you become immursed in the plot and you have a hard time putting the book down as one chapter just pours into another. Most know by now that this is about three guys who grew up together in an area near Boston and how their lives were star crossed from the outset. You will get to know them, their wives, mothers, fathers, friends, and enemies and you will laugh with them, cry for them and sometimes pray for them.

A president is in trouble in the polls; his opponant is a ruthless SOB who steps on people rather than around them; the opponant's daughter is called upon by the president to go to the Arctic to verify a scientific find of monumental proportions which can have a conclusive impact on the presidential race and this is just the beginning of a chilling story of intrigue, deception, miscalculation and ambition. The reader is drawn along in unraveling the mystery behind the find in the Arctic and then propelled suddenly into a race for revelaing the truth. Things are seldom what they seem and we can all be thankful that this is a true work of fiction. It will hold your interest and picque your curiosity throughout, which is a pretty good trick for any author.	2004-06-01

I discovered Henning Mackell while discussing books with a friend who's reading interests are even more divergent than mine over cocktails in Bermuda. Not only did she suggest I read the author, she gave me the book to read the next day. A day and a half later I was a fan.<br />Kurt Wallender is not your typical police detective and this is not your typical whodunit. It starts with a next door neighbor in a farming community noting that the sound of the night was different. The next door neighbor's horse was not whinnying. Looking more closely it appearred that the kitchen window was open on a very cold night. Looking more closely, it was clear that it was smashed in. Inside he discovers that the couple have been brutally attacked - the husband has sustained wounds that the M.E. says any four kinds of them would have killed him. His wife is alive, but barely. She has a noose arround her neck. Pretty violent stuff for a poor Swedish farming commmunity.<br />Kurt Wallender has his own problems. His wife has left him. His teen age daughter has gone also. He is drinking too much and dreaming x-rated encounters with a black woman. He is acting chief and mounts the investigation into what seems to be a random crime with no purpose other than to kill.<br />Despite his personal problems, he is a first rate detective and you are drawn along quite easily into what it must be like to really be in this line of work. It is a profession that has much less glamor than many novels give it, but it is also a profession that has exacting standards, required methods and sometimes when all else fails, luck and hunches help. <br />The news of the case horrifies people and when word leaks out that the wife said the word \\"foreign\\" before dying, it opens a dark underside in the Swedish populace. Immigration in Sweden is a hot topic and refugees are held loosely in encampments. Threats start to come in against the refugees. One is assaulted. One is killed and a second hunt begins in parallel with the first. A Swedish KKK is on the loose.<br />This is a well told story which will hold your interest and I suspect also interest you in the sequels which follow with Detective Wallender. What more can you ask for?	2004-06-01

If you genuflect to the altar of political correctness, this will be a tough read. <br />Mitch Rapp returns. Flynn introduces him bluntly to those who have not read his prior novels as he prepares to interrogate five al Qaeda operatives who have been captured in a raid on a secret stronghold: &quot;Calling Rapp a counterterrorism operative was essentially a polite way of ducking the truth. When everything was stripped away, the reality was that that he was an assassin. He has killed, and killed often, for his country, and in his mind 9/11 was proof that he hadn't killed enough.&quot;<br />His interrogation produces the picture of a terrorist attack on the United States that involves a nuclear weapon. The picture is clear enough to cause alarm, but fuzzy enough to make the entire plan a puzzle. <br />Slowly the puzzle seems to be solved and just when it looks like the threat is past, well, it isn't. <br />This is vintage Flynn. It is an absolute page turner. It will make you think. It may cause some angst. It should. This is a realistic picture of where we are and what we are doing, both the good and the bad. That's where the angst comes in.	2004-05-18

The personal side of the relationship between a player and his caddy. Not just any player - Tom Watson. Not just any caddy - Bruce Edwards. They met by chance and Watson said they would try it for a week and see how it goes. It went for 30 years and ended only because Edwards contracted ALS. This is a charming and well told story that will bring a smile to your face and a tear to your eye. It isn't all fairways and greens. It also involves a heart and a soul.	2004-05-08

In this novel things are seldom what they seem and it would spoil the read for me to reveal the twists and turns that this story takes. The straight forward story is that Ashley Spencer, a high school soccer star has a friend to her house for a sleep over following a big game and awakens to the most terrifying experience one can imagine. A masked stranger is in their room. He ties up Ashley and takes her friend into another room where he rapes and murders her. Returning to her room, he says, &quot;I'll see you later&quot; and she hears him go down to the kitchen. Her father, who is the only parent in the house that night crawls into her room suffering from multiple stab wounds and using the last of his energy frees fer from her bonds and she escapes out her window.<br />This appears to be a random event until Ashley's mother is taking a creative writing course at a nearby private school in which Ashley has enrolled and hears the instructor read a passage from a piece of writing that describes the event that her daughter has gone through and also includes a part of what happened that received no publicity. She eventually determines that no one in the class wrote the story and that it was drafted by the instructor, Joshua Maxwell, himself.<br />Her suspicions are aroused to the point where she confides them to the Dean of the school who checks out the instructor's background and calls the mother suggesting a meeting to discuss what she has found. While jogging on the school grounds near where the meeting is taking place, Ashley hears a scream and decides to investigate. What she sees as she peers in the window are the bodies of two women lying on the floor (the Dean and Ashley's mother) and Joshua Maxwell standing over them with a bloody knife in his hands. He sees her as she turns and runs for her life with Maxwell in pursuit. She escapes, the story is out,Maxwell is pursued and eventually arrested and brought to trial. And the story is JUST BEGINNING. Margolin uses an interesting vehicle in telling the story. The Dean, Casey Van Meter, was not murdered, but ended up in a coma. Her brother, Miles Van Meter has written a book about the events leading up to her being in the coma entitled, Sleeping Beauty. A continuing thread in this book is his presence at a book signing where he reads from the book and answers questions about it. <br />I will leave it to the reader to explore the intracies of this very well told tale. It is an undertaking that will be well worth the effort.	2004-04-29

In fact, I think I have only read one or two, so I have no comment from a historical perspective on the qualities of this one. I found the book to be an easy and fun read. Mr. Parker has mastered the art of making a book look larger than it really is, but his use of dialogue and his sense of humor appeal to me. <br />Things start out easily enough when Spencer is hired by a suspicious wife to tail her cheating husband. As it turns out the lady he is seeing is also being tailed by another PI and so is the lady that hired him. It seems that all of the principals are involved with one very up and coming company called, Kinergy and further investigation discovers that there is some musical bedrooms being played by the principals, all under the encouragement of a local radio personality who believes that marriage should not limit one's ability to show love for another.<br />This is starting to look like a bedroom farce until one of the players is shot dead in his office. The deceased is the husband whom Spencer had been hired to tail. The cheese gets more binding when the chief of security at Kinergy also turns up dead in an apparent suicide, which is more apparently another murder.<br />In his trademark fashion, Parker takes Spencer through the hoops along with the other characters that populate these novels and in the end, justice is done in a rather entertaining fashion. <br />I enjoyed it.	2004-04-21

Brad Thor has written another compelling novel which will make you thankful that it is a work of fiction. During the Cold War the Soviets created numerous sleeper agents in the United States and provided them with suitcase nuclear bombs. Guarding against that possibility the United States created a similar cadre of agents. With the breakup of the SU, it was reasonably assumed that they would never be called on. That assumption held until the president is presented with a picture of such a bomb secreted in the Mall of America and directions on how to find it. The message is that this is just one of twenty such bombs and unless the president essentially removes the US from the world stage in his State of the Union address which is to occur in eight days, they will be detonated.<br />Reacting to the threat, the US moves to deploy it's agents, only to discover that all but two have been killed, one has been brutally interrogated and the other is being used to bait a trap.<br />Scott Horvath is once again called on by the president to save the day and in doing so, Mr. Thor has woven an ingenious plot, filled with interesting and dastardly characters which will keep you turning the pages and reluctant to put it down.	2004-04-21

The biggest of them is that he keeps wandering into the middle of the damndest things. In this very real and believeable book, he has been shown some of the underside of golf.(again)The Russian Mafia has infiltrated the PGA Tour in order to launder a large amount of money and for insurance on the effort they have kidnapped the four month old daughter of the PGA Tour official who is set to make the money laundering happen. The purpose in doing so is to ensure the success of the mission, but it is in fact one of the things that leads to the whole plots unraveling. Jack Austen is a PGA professional who has yet to win a tournament, but who nevertheless has enjoyed success on the tour. He has a comfortable living arrangement with one of the star reporters for CBS on the tour, he has taken on a &quot;summer project&quot; as his caddy, a dyslexic black teenager (Austen is also dyslexic and understands the disease) and while pursuing his favorite occupation, both arrangements get very complicated.<br />This is really a human interest story which uses the PGA Tour as it's backdrop and does so in an interesting and convincing fashion. Phil Mickelson even makes an appearance and continues his winning ways. <br />I liked this book even more than his first one, The characters remain in character throughout the book, the plot is interesting and the resolution is in doubt for some time. A first rate effort and a compelling read.	2004-04-14

This is a story that grabs the reader right from the first and never loosens it's grip until the story has played out. The title, which seems to be a mystery in and of itself comes from Lewis Carrol and is part of a new music video which is being released by Bison Records. A performed preview of the video for selected viewers is interrupted by the forceful kidnapping of the video's female star and she is held for ransom by the bad guys. In the book one of the characters is an author and he describes to an associate that the way to keep people's attention when writing a book is to have a ticking clock. Taking his own advice, McBain creates a loudly ticking clock in this book as the police and the FBI search for the hostage and deal with the ransom demands that are forthcoming. This is a fine piece of writing with clear and believeable characters, an interesting plot line and several unexpected twists and turns, all of which keep the pages turning.<BR>Ed McBain is still one of the best at this genre.	2004-03-27

He had once been to The Show. But, after an automobile accident with a woman who was busy distracting him from the perils of the road he was laughed off the PGA Tour (he was arrested during the golf tournament on national TV) and relegated to the backwaters of golf, teaching the rest of us how to stop slicing the ball and how to get out of sand traps.<br />However, there is a convergence of events that sets out to change his life. He turns 50 and a sales rep leaves a prototype driver for him to try out. It is labeled The Enola Gay. Bonnet gives the Enola Gay a secret workout and is astounded with the results. He confides his interest in the Senior Tour to his greenskeeper, Doublewide McBride and before you can say Dorothy Ridge, he volunteers to be Bonnet's caddie. After an experimental foray into a local Senior event, the Enola Gay performs like a champion, Bonnet supplies the rest and a plan is hatched to go to Q School and then on to the Senior Tour. Only one problem stands in his way. How to finance such a venture. That's where Dorothy Ridge comes in. A former Rockette, Dorothy was at one time the trophy wife of an captain of industry.By the time she has turned 70 the old gent is witless and foolish and Dorothy has been put in charge of his fortune. Bonnet approaches her with \\"an investment oppotunity\\", i.e. financing him for a year on the Senior Tour. During the investment discussion, a couple of bottles of wine (Pommard '61) are consumed and Bonnett discovers that Dottie still has a dancer's body and the sex drive of every guy's wet dreams. Dottie agrees to sign on if Del can survive Q School. Shealso comes up with a new name for the mystery driver. Big Luther. The subject arose when something else of Del's rose during the \\"interview.\\"<br />From there the book takes off on a satrical trip through the Senior Tour. Team Del (Del, Doublewide and Luther) are on the trip of their lives, but others are plotting to derail his career and Big Luther. It's very entertaining, but better told in the reading of it than being spelled out here.	2004-03-21

I then read later efforts and adjusted my thinking. This book is fine as long as you suspend belief in the ultimate objective, i.e. believing the plot. However, there is a lot of insight in this book in to the working of the legislative side of the government which is instructive and interesting...and as I have said...if you buy into the plot that he sets, the rest is easy. I did have a problem with how he told this story. In the first person for two of the characters, one of whom is murdered, and then back to the third person. Maybe it works for others...it didn't for me. However this is NOT a bad book. It is just a bit different and if you like the author...go for it.	2004-03-12

Until I bought this book I had considered A Time To Kill to be his best, even though it was his first and even though others were best sellers.<br />Grisham is a Son of Missisippi and he does his best writing when he return to his roots. Both of the novels I have just refered to are set in Ford County and the author knows that place like the back of his hand.<br />The people are real, the town is real and by the time you finish the book you figure you could find your way around there,too.<br />Willie Traynor is the narrator for this ride. He is a Yankee who went to Syracuse University, dropped out and found his way to The Ford County Times. It is a family owned weekly that has found it's niche by writing the best obituaries of all of its citizens that one can imagine,white or black. Including blacks is the idea of the current owner and as good as he is at writing obits, he is in no sense a businessman and the paper is forced into involuntary banckruptcy.<br />Willie has a rich grandma who cares about him and he convinces her to loan him $50,000 to buy the paper. Thus, in his early 20's, Willie takes charge of the local weekly.<br />Soon thereafter, a local woman is raped and murderd. The cirsumstances are terrifying and the accused is arrested with the victims blood on his shirt. The accused is a member of a local clan who live on an island just of the coast and whose lawless ways are well known.<br />Willie gets very involved in the trial and it's coverage. Previously he has befriended a black woman who ends up on the jury. The accused is convicted, but spared the death penalty by the same jury and is sentenced to two consecutive life terms. <br />Thats the good news. The bad news is that in Mississippi, life means 10 years. Th worse news is that somehow the consecutive terms have been made concurrent. This particular murderer has had the bad judgement to tell the jury that\\"If you convict me. I will kill you all.\\" Neverthe less he will be up for parole in less than ten years.<br />Nine year later, with the convicted felon out on parole, jurors start being killed and the town is in turmoil. <br />That is as far as I go with the story line. You need to read the rest to see how it comes out. I deduced the outcome about 20 pages from the end and you may or may not, but the important thing to remember is that this is Grisham at his best. Talking about the people he knows about and a town he understands. In so doing he draws us all into a better understanding of each other. This is a truly wonderful story. I hope you read it.	2004-03-05

He then moved on to the involvement of the Roman Catholic Church and the silence of Pope Pius XII during that time in \\"The Confessor.\\" This book deals with those who were directly involved, what they did, how they tried to cover it up and how they tried to live among us.<br />It starts in Vienna when an organization known as \\"Wartime Claims and Inquiries\\" is bombed, resulting in two deaths and life threatening injuries to Eli Lavon, the person who has singlehandedly run the operation in search of those responsible for the Holocost.<br />Gabriel Allon, an art restorer and a covert operative for Israel is tasked to go to Vienna in determine who is responsible. Vienna holds many memories for Allon, most of them bad and this trip only adds to them.<br />Daniel Silva is a master at this type of story which is like eating an artichoke as one peels off the leaves and savors them in order to get to the center. Along the way the reader learns more about the horrors of the Holocost and the elaborate efforts by many to conceal thei involvement and become a force in society again.<br />Daniel Siva is a serious writer and the subject matter he has chosen lends itself to his abilities. It is not necessary to have read the first two books in the series, but you will appreciate this one more if you do. As individual stories they are remarkable. Taken together they are a masterpiece.	2004-03-01

The title refers to the fact that SWAT teams refer to doors in this manner as they are most vulnerable to being shot when they are in one. <br />As this story starts to unwind, a LA Sheriff's Deputy is gunned down as he tries to serve a warrant on a person suspected of harboring automatic weapons. The shooter then barracades himself inside his house and using an AK-47 takes on the Sheriff Department's SWAT along with an ATF SWAT team that arrives on the scene. During a ferocious gun battle, the ATF fires hot gas grenades into the house and it catches on fire which quickly turns into an inferno and then a bunch of massive explosions as weapons and other material in the garage are touched off. End of gun fight.<br />LAPD officer Shane Scully finds himself in the middle of the matter as he has heard the transmissions about the officer being shot and believes it is a friend of his. He was right. Dead right.<br />After the ashes cool the debris yeilds what is left of a burned body in an upstairs bathtub. DNA evidence makes it a perfect match with the shooter.<br />With that aspect of the case closed, recriminations start to fly about what ATF was doing on the scene and why they fired hot gas into the house, endangering the entire neighborhood. It is then discovered that ATF had asked the Sherrif's Department to serve the warrant and didn't advise of the extent of their suspicions about the type of person that was being served.<br />Things go from bad to badder after the funeral of the deputy when the two SWAT teams end up in the same bar with predictable results.<br />Shortly thereafter, one of the ATF officers is shot by a sniper.<br />The evidence begins to pile up indicating a SWAT Unit War and Scully as neither ATF or SD is asked to investigate the matter by the Mayor and get to the bottom of who is doing what.<br />The answer will astound you and I'm not going to give it away. What I will tell you is that Cannell has once again written a real page turner that lacks nothing in the way of action, intrigue and human relationships. (He could stand to brush up on his bridge game terminology, but that's a small matter that I just couldn't resist mentioning.)<br />I'm already looking forward to the next one.	2004-02-25

Those of us who have reveled in the discovery of this author and his Dismas Hardy/Abe Glitsky novels have been with these two old friends for a long time and through some hair raising and heart breaking times. Hardy, who once was a San Francisco cop is now the managing partner of his San Francisco law firm. Glitsky who was a homicide detective for the SFPD is now a Deputy Chief. Yet, for all their lofty current positions, they are dragged into a compelling drama by the events that are going on around them.<br />Amy Wu is an associate in Hardy's firm. She is dealing the the four month old death of her father by looking for love in all the wrong places when she receives a call from a wealthy couple who's son she has represented in a minor juvenile matter to inform her that &quot;Andrew is in trouble again.&quot; That, it turns out, is an understatement. <br />It seems that Andrew was rehearsing for the school play with the teacher who was directing the play and with his girlfriend. The play is &quot;Who is Afraid of Virginia Woolf.&quot; Andrew and his girlfriend have the leads. While taking a break from rehearsing, Andrew takes a break to go for a walk to work on his lines. When he returns he finds them both shot to death.<br />Two months later the police have decided to charge him with murder. His parents (actually Mom and Step-Dad) are horrified. &quot;He said he didn't do it,&quot; says Mom. &quot;I know he didn't do it.&quot; ...&quot;Andrew is not that type of person.&quot; <br />After reviewing the police evidence Amy Wu is not so sure. It turns out that in the past Andrew expressed jealosy of Mr. Mooney, the teacher and his relationship with his girlfriend.  He even wrote a short story entitled &quot;Perfect Killer&quot; in which he details how a young man who is jealous of his girlfriend and a teacher plots to murder them and how he does it in such a way as to avoid guilt. He shares the story with his best friend at school. He even starts to bring his step father's gun to school with him in a knapsack. Then there is the yelling and arguing that those living over Mr. Mooney's apartment hear along with crashing and banging down below. When they look out of the window to see what is happening, the husband sees a person he later idetifies as Andrew fleeing the apartment. He then goes down and discovers the vitims. Doesn't look so good for Andrew.<br />Especially after the police find a spent 9mm shell in his car. Especially after he admits to throwing the gun he had been carrying around off the Golden Gate Bridge.<br />In fact, it looks so bad to Amy that she tries to get him to plead guilty to the offense as a juvenile. He will be in jail for only eight years under California law if convicted as a juvenile. She convinces the parents that this is the best way to go and she convinces herself. The one little detail that she fails to cover is convincing her client. Her next error is to tell the Assistant DA that he will plead before she has gotten that nailed down. It all becomes unraveled in juvenile court as the client maintains his innocense and Ms. Wu quickly finds herself in the cross hairs of an angry judge and a furious district attorney. The matter is quickly calendared for a hearing on whether he should be tried as a juvenile or an adult and the outcome looks forgone. Her client, instead of facing eight years will likely be facing life.<br />Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Glitsky is having his own problems with his new job and is embroiled with a high profile decision not to take a known murderer off a bus, but to wait until the passengers disembark and arrest him then. Quick and easy. Except the target smells the police and takes the passengers hostage, killing several before his demands for a helicopter and transportaion are met. He is killed by a sniper on the way to the copter, but the media is merciless in pursuing the matter.<br />As a part of his job, Glitsky becomes aware of a murder where a woman without an enemy inthe world is gunned down as she answers her front door. The husband is the only possible suspect, but that is going nowhere. Glitsky decides to talk to him and is also convinced that the husband is innocent. The only thing out of the ordinary that the woman ever did in her life was be a part of a jury many years ago who had convicted a person for murder.<br />Shortly thereafter, the District Attorney is found murdered in the parking lot outside of his office. <br />Dismas Hardy feels that he is responsible for the mess that Amy Wu has created by failing to mentor her properly and decides to sit &quot;second chair&quot; in the deternmination hearing that has been ordered to go forward in five days.<br />To tell more about the story line would be to spoil the fun of reading a master story teller at the top of his game. Suffice it to say that the stories converge and the ending is all that a reader of this type of novel could ask for. I look forward to Lescroat's novels and if you have not discovered him yet, it is high time you did.	2004-02-19

And tell us he does. He says he is doing it because confession is supposed to be good for the soul.<br />Jack's first confession involves his downfall from a prestigioius Atlanta law firm. He is approached by a beautiful woman who begs him to accept a pro bono representation of her boyfriend who is charged with a drug crime. At first he declines but the vision of the woman remains with him and he finally asks for permission from his firm to take on the case. Once permission was granted one thing leads to another and the grateful girlfriend winds up in Jack's bed for a night of lovemaking. The boyfriend is successfully defended and thanks his girlfriend for her efforts on his behalf by beating her to death. This time he gets a bargain basement lawyer who thinks the jury might have some sympathy for his client if the fact of the amorous relationship is brought out, so Jack is subpoenaed to a deposition and the story comes out. End of job in tony Atlanta law firm.<br />Two years later...he is trolling the depths of the criminal justice system as the sole practitioner in Jack Hammond and Associates when he is notified that one of his former clients has died of a drug overdose. As Jack explores the cirsumstances of the death, things do not add up and he is inexorably drawn into a mystery which has many roads, but no easy endings.<br />Another beautiful woman surfaces as he tries to unravel the facts behind the death. Powerful forces are at work to prevent both of them from finding the answers they seek and the story weaves together like a fine rug to a powerful ending.<br />Reed Arvin is an outstanding writer with a keen ear for diologue and the ability to tell a story in such a way that you are sorry to see the pages getting fewer. The Last Goodbye was my first exposure to this writer. It will not be the last.	2004-02-17

Well, the third time was a charm and Scratch comes through on all counts. It is funny, incisive, educational and thoroughly entertaining. The chapters that deal with the trial over the suit by the Medalist Golf Ball Company against Caminetti's golf ball company are as funny as anything I have encountered along those lines since My Cousin Vinny. Their is a lot of common sense wisdom imparted in the book about the gullibility of golfers<BR>who just have to have the latest golf ball or the most advanced club in order to play up to their maximum ability. All I can say about that is read and learn. To tell the whole story line would be to give too much away. Just trust me. It is a hoot!	2004-02-13

As it is, I thought it was an interesting mystery. Two Secret Service agents are involved in a violent act being carried out against the people they were sworn to protect. One is assasinated. Sean King is the agent on that one. One is abducted. Michelle Maxwell is in charge of that one. Eight years seperates the two acts. Yet, the acts are linked and more people are about to die as the two agents start investigating the incidents and start turning up rocks that people don't want moved. There are numerous suprises and many things are not what they seem. I liked the book, but I did not love it. Maybe you want to wait for the paperback issue.	2004-02-02

Rifled cannons, rifled rifles, exploding ordinance.&quot; They were all Americans, like it or not, all children of that particular genius that was America. How apt then that in less than a year of war, Americans fighting Americans, they should forever alter forever the very nature of warfare.&quot;<br />That paragraph, found late in this marvelous book, truly frames the story that plays out between it's covers.<br />It comes from a perspective that many of us find at least different and sometimes uncomfortable. It is a story of the Confederate Navy and is told with sympathy and understanding as well as painstaking historical attention to fact.<br />Samual Bowater, a former officer in the United States Navy has resigned his commission to return to his home, the Confederacy and seeks to help in the only way he knows how,  by seeking to serve as a naval officer. He watches from a distance and paints the scene as Fort Sumter is fired on and the Civil War begins.<br />Robey Paine, a man of Mississippi with three sons to send to fight for the Confederacy believes that all of them have been lost in battle. A certian madness is the result, which will find him commissioning the conversion of a ship to an ironclad and leads him to the discovery that one of his som's has survived.<br />This is a moving story of a small part of the Civil War which shows it's horror and it's passion in way that is compelling.<br />Although I live in Maine, as does the author - about 25 miles from me - I was unaware of his writing until this book was recommended to my wife by an insightful bookstore clerk as a Christmas present for me. It is, I believe, the best book I have read in quite some time and it has already started me ordering other books written by James Nelson and looking forward to his next effort. I would give it ten stars if I could.	2004-01-29

I had not heard of this author until I was contacted by him and asked if I would be interested in reading his book. Novels concerning political intrigue are an interest of mine. No promises were made concerning how I might review this book and none were requested.<br />As a story with fast moving action and plenty of interesting twists and turns, this is fun to read. I was a bit put off by the time period in which the book was cast which was mostly in 1999 and 2000. The President of the United States during the time period was Bill Clinton and quite frankly, I had difficulty in ascribing any of the actions of this unnamed president in the book to the 42nd President of the United States.<br />The story could just as easily have been moved to a time when we do not know who the president will be. Passing by that, I thought that the &quot;hero&quot; of the book had a lot of James Bond in him for someone who was an ex-medical intern while serving in the Korean conflict and who has become over the passage of time a multi millionaire business consultant.<br />The story line of the book is that some right wing zealots are plotting to take over the Presidency of the United States in such a way that the people are not aware that a coup has actually taken place. There is a mastermind to all of this who weaves in and out of the plot like a Svengali who will undoubtedly reappear in a future novel as will Owen MacDara, the James Bondian business consultant.<br />I also agree that this could make a very good movie and I actually think that the plot and story line may be better suited to the screen.	2004-01-21

If you watched the games, this is a journal of that experience which you will appreciate and read again and again.

The tournament doesn't even start until page 262. <br />What this book is about is how the United States Golf Association decided to bring it's prestigious Open Championship to a municipal golf course on Long Island, rather than the famed country clubs which have hosted this event since it's inception and what goes in to putting on such an event. The title says&quot; Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black.&quot; What you really get is inside the workings of the USGA, what goes on behind the scenes, how decisions are made (or not),how catastrophes were avoided (or not)and in the end you may have learned more about what was involved in bringing this tournament to this course than you really wanted to know. <br />To those of us who follow golf closely and have attended a US Open, this is a very interesting read. Feinstein researches his subject exhastively and tells the story in an interesting manner, but at the end of the book I don't believe the reader has gotten a full measure of what has been promised.

The scariest thing about this book is that it could be happening.Middle Eastern terrorists, The Sword of Islam, have located a corrupt Russian general who is willing to sell nuclear warheads which he is in charge of guarding. Four are delivered which sets in motion a riveting story of their delivery to the United States and the forces which are hunting them down in order to prevent the ultimate catastrophy.<br />Jake Grafton, a central figure in many of Coonts's book is put in charge of a secret antiterrorism task force by the President<BR>and given powers to use which may be constitutionaly suspect, but necessary nonetheless. When his powers are described to him, Grafton tells the President that &quot;If the press gets this, you'll be impeached and I'll go to prison.&quot; The President's response is that &quot;The president has the inherant power to defend the nation. I'm using that power here and now.&quot; That pretty much sets the tone for what is to follow. <br />An interesting melange of characters flesh out the story and set up a tense and gripping situation in New York harbor involving Fleet Week, an armed atomic device on the torch platform of the Statue of Liberty and a desperate plan to avoid disaster. When informed of how Grafton plans to subdue the terrorists, the FBI wryly comments, &quot;You don't have a plan.&quot; Maybe not, but it makes for page turning reading. <br />This tale is as current as tomorrows headlines and as scary as it gets. Let's hope that it never comes to that and remains fiction.	2004-01-01

Talk about conflicting emotions....William Lashner has crafted  the best legal-mystery-thriller of the year in my judgement and I don't hand out praise to this type of book lightly.<br />Victor Carl is called to the scene of a murder by a former law school classmate and friend, Guy Forrest. He finds Forrest sitting on the front steps of the house, naked, with the apparent murder weapon at his feet and beside himself with grief. Inside Carl finds Forrest's fiance, Hailey Prioux with a bullet through her heart. Carl's first emotion is shock, then grief and then revenge. Why? Well, he has been sleeping with Hailey on a fairly regular basis during this time and she has worked her spell on him, just as she has with any man she cared to. It seems clear to Carl that Forrest murdered her. With revenge on Forrest as his prime motivation, Carl agrees to represent him and plans to see that he is convicted and sentenced to death, all the while appearing to defend him. Tricky, eh?<br />Well, it certainly is and it gets even trickier as Carl probes into the background of his lover. As he does so, he eventually becomes convinced that his client his innocent, however it comes about at a point where the evidence againt Forrest is very compelling. How Carl works to extricate his client from a web that his own lawyer has helped create is interesting reading. There is no need for a suspension of belief or a leap of faith. It is well crafted, compelling story telling. The trial scenes at the end are a treat. Those who compare this to a Grisham novel do a disservice to the author. It is better!	2003-12-20

As James Dodson closed one of his bedtime stories to his young son which involved them roaming the ancient world, slaying dragons, fighting black nights and saving damzels in distress, young Jack looked up and said, &quot;Dad, do you think we could do that stuff some time?...See dragons and visit real castles and things like that?&quot; &quot;Sure,&quot; Dodson replied. &quot;Someday. When you are older.&quot;<br />Well &quot;someday&quot; has arrived in the Dodson household and if you enjoy a well told tale you will want to join the unstructured, open ended odyssey that was their summer of 2001. It begins three days after Dodson and Dame Wendy, his true love that he met and wrote about in The Dewsweepers, are married. You might think she would be coming along on the adventure, but you would be wrong. Accompanying them for the first part of the trip is The Queen Mum, Dodson's ex-mother in law and Jack's grandmother, who being a native of Scotland is going to England before she splits off for Scotland on her own for her &quot;semiannual inspection tour of the premises.&quot; Dame Wendy is to join them later when they have made their way to Italy. In the meantime, she is staying home to water the plants and make arrangements for the travelers over the internet as needed. <br />If you have an inquiring mind and a free spirit you will delight in following the adventures of Jim and Jack as they travel through Europe. There are few dull moments, many humorous ones, some sobering, but always interesting. There are too many characters and situations to recount here, but I guarantee you that if you buy your ticket to join them at your local bookstore or on Amazon that you will not regret having gone along for the ride.<br />This is the fourth book by Dodson in what has become kind of a serial autobiography of a part of his life. This may be the best of the bunch.	2003-12-13

For this is not a &quot;golf book&quot; any more than Seabiscuit was about a horse race. The author, a former 2 handicap realizes as he advances into his 40's that &quot;I wasn't just losing my ability to play the game the way I once had...Golf was ceasing to be fun.&quot;<br />Dodson discovers the group of guys that become The Dewseppers when he is enveigled to travel to Syracuse to speak at a charity fund raiser. The fellow doing the inviting had read his previous book &quot;Final Rounds&quot; and thought the author might have something worth listening to about golf forging lasting relationships. One thing leads to another and the antics and follys of The Dewsweepers become a thread which runs through the book, but the story is about much more than them.<br />It is about relationships of all kinds. A son and his mother. A boy and his father. A lovely lady named Wendy.  Arnold Palmer. Aging friends. A chance meeting on a magical golf course. Brotherly love gone sour. And so many more.<br />Dodson has the most interesting way of making how we relate to each other, the humor, the sorrow, the mundane and the magificent all come alive in a very real way. I found the book enthralling. <br />Those who have reviewed this book and sniffed about some of the name dropping that occurs in it are missing the point entirely. People like Arnold Palmer just happen to be a real part of Dodson's life. To leave out the &quot;names&quot; is to fail to tell the story to it's fullest.<br />In the end he finds that the joy he had gotten from golf during his life was not lost. As he puts it, it was &quot;merely waiting for me to catch up...&quot; <br />There is a lot to learn about life and relationships in this book and I doubt there are any of us who could not benefit from that.	2003-12-11

Short paragraphs - little fleshing out of a story - lots of twists and turns in the hunt for a brutal killer - just interesting enough to keep you reading - but fairly thin gruel. Alex Cross, the ex-DC homicide cop who joined the FBI in Four Blind Mice is earning his spurs as he joins the hunt for the Wolf, a member of the Russian Mafiya who has plans to be the godfather of all organized crime. What initially has the FBI's attention is the kidnappings of white women who it turns out have been &quot;ordered&quot; by wealthy patrons who have designs on them. Why the Wolf would be involved in such an activity when his designs are so much larger is never explained. Patterson also brings a custody battle over Little Alex in to the story which does little or nothing to advance the plot, but perhaps he needed a few more chapters. He has done better and hopefully will again.	2003-12-06

I found out about this author by being offered a preview edition of a book he will be coming out with after the first of the year. I liked it so much that I decided to read this work by him and I am so glad that I did. The Will is a tightly crafted mystery that keeps you wondering how it will unravel as you keep turning the pages. Henry Matthews is an up and coming associate in a prestigious Chicgo law firm which specializes in corporate takeovers and such. He is being groomed in the job by a wonderfully manipulative mentor when he takes a call from Roger Crandall, the only son of the richest man in Council Grove, Kansas, his home town. Tyler Crandall has died and Roger's father was the lawyer that drew his will. He is also deceased and Tyler Crandall has left written instructions that Henry is to be contacted concerning his will. The document is in an envelope which states it is only to be opened and read when all of the heirs are present. <br />Henry heads back to Council Grove to attend to what he assumes is a rather mundane piece of tying up loose ends and walks into a life changing event. While the will contains bequests to his widow, daughter and son, they are minimal considering the size of his estate. He has left the bulk of it to the town nut case, referred to as The Birdman. Roger is beside himself as he had expected to step into his father's shoes and run the town as his daddy had. This is not a result he is willling to accept and he undertakes to contest the will.<br />The defense of the will takes Henry into a fascinating maze of relationships which draw the reader deeper and deeper into the secrets that the town has been hiding for over twenty years. Arvin's characters are well drawn, his use of dialogue is powerful and as the mystery unravels like the peeling of an onion, the reader is treated to one of the best books of this type that I have read in some time. You will not regret buying this book.	2003-12-03

Those that are sniffing about the \\"name dropping\\" and other such distractions have missed the point of the book entirely. \\"Golf, and sometimes life, is full of new beginnings,\\" Dobson writes as the first line of the first chapter. And that is what this book is about. His love of the game has started to dry up; he is living in Maine while his girl friend lives in Syracuse (or Zerocuse as those who golf there call it for part of the year), his dear mother (Mrs. Congeniality) is slipping deeper into dementia; his brother has betrayed his trust and his ten year old son, after his final losing hockey game of the season looks at his father and says, \\"Dad, would you mind if I took golf lessons?\\" As Dobson then noted, \\"When you least expect it, the sun suddenly emerges from the gloom.\\"<br />That is what this book is really about.The \\"Dewsweepers\\", while a real bunch of golfing nuts from Zerocuse, are really the prisim through which the author sees his life and deals with it, piece by piece as he finds that the joy of life has not been lost. It was merely waiting for him to catch up with it.<br />This slice of the author's life is told with humor and insight. Many doors have been opened to Dobson during his life experiences that are not easily open to most of us. Yet, he takes us through them with the supreme talent of an accomplished story teller and leaves you feeling better for the experience of having been there. That's a fine recommendation for any book and this is one not to miss.	2003-11-28

Adam Chapel hunts terrorists by \\"following the money.\\" It is not easy finding the \\"golden thread\\" and it is decidedly not dull for Mr. Chapel. The plan has been years in the making and inspite of painstaking care on the mastermind behind it, pieces of it come to light. Sarah Churchill hunts terrorists the old fashioned way. On the ground. As their lives intertwine they each do their part to uncover the plot which involves overthrowing the government of Saudi Arabia by the neuclear destruction of the White House while the Saudi King is guest of honor at a White House dinner. There are many twists and turns in the plot which will hold the reader, but throughout the novel one thought kept reocurring to me, i.e., that there was no suspension of belief needed to appreciate this story. It is frighteningly real and far too plausable for comfort. A superb effort!	2003-11-21

Getting to the Peace talks alive and getting out of them alive are really what this book is about. And while the story is about that it bounces along in fine fashion as Jon Bennett, the President's &quot;point man&quot; for the Peace Process and Erin McCoy, his CIA protector and love interest endure more perils than Pauline ever imagined. Those that liked the first book will enjoy this one, for the most part.	2003-11-08

It holds your attention, challenges your ideas of what is credible, makes you laugh, makes you think and always entertains you. I looked forward to picking it up and continuing along with the story of the Don Quixote of the legal community in California as he tilted at windmills and the judiciary that thought him unworthy. However, one of his windmills turned out to be real and also deadly and how that all gets exposed and dealt with is a most entertaining story and a tale worth reading and thinking about. Let's hope that the technology which is in the book is not available today. The fly leaf says it is. If so, we all have something to think about.	2003-10-31

The ad is seeking an Avenger. During WW II Grumman aircraft made such a plane for the Navy. The person who placed the ad is not looking for an aircraft. He is looking for justice. He is looking for the murderer of his grandson.<br />In a story which weaves it's way from the stink hole of Viet Nam to the jungles of South America and the halls of power in Washington, Forsythe spins a tale of intrigue and cunning which culminates on September 10, 2001. In doing so, he imparts much of his wisdom on the events of our times and fashions a first rate read that will hold your interest from the first page to the last.	2003-10-25

We have an entepreneur in my area who's commercials end with the thundered phrase: &quot;Harris knows golf!&quot; Well, Hagberg knows submarines and the parts of the book which are involved with them are the most entertaining and informative from my point of view. <br />Pakistan has developed THE BOMB. Not your garden variety terrorist type of nuclear device, but a hydrogen bomb. A city buster. And it can be delivered from an air plane, not a missle. That ability is discovered by a CIA team which has infiltrated Pakistan to observe the testing of a new weapons system who get much more than they expected, including being captured, imprisoned and abused.<br />Prior to the test a US satelite observing the area is blinded by a laser attack from a Kilo class submarine, national origin unknown. The laser attack is observed by an American oceanographic research ship which is torpedoed and sunk as a result of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. <br />The CIA team on the ground gets the message out of the delivery system for the Pakistani bomb before they are caught and an effort is made to rescue them. There is also a need to repair the satellite, accomplish the rescue and defend the shuttle crew doing the repair from another laser attack. To do this the USS Seawolf is called into service. Cmdr. Frank Dillon is in charge and it is a good thing for all concerned that he is.<br />The remainder of the book is involved with protecting the satellite repair, getting the sub which has fired the laser, rescuing the CIA team and making the world a safer place, all of which seems to have been accomplished until the last chapter when we find that the story is not over and the prelude to what follows is chilling. Hagberg fans will be waiting for the next installment.	2003-10-18

Star Witness is a different breed of cat than the others. It is not really a court room drama although a murder trial is one of the central venues. It is a murder mystery and even when the book is finished, you will be wondering about the identity of the murderer. It also is a commentary on the movie business and the rarified atmosphere that those who &quot;make pictures&quot; live in. Joseph Antonelli, criminal defense lawyer extrodonaire returns again as counsel and foil for Stanely Roth, a famous film producer, studio head and the accused murderer of his famous actress wife. The facts are not in his favor. His wife has been killed (her throat was cut) in their Hollywood mansion. He claims to have left for work very early and had slept in another bedroom so as not to disturb his wife and was unaware that she had been killed. Blood stained clotheing is found in his clohes hamper. The clothes are his. The blood is hers. There is no evidence that anyone other than the maid and Mr. Roth were on the premises during the time she was killed. Things seem pretty open and shut to the police who arrest him and charge him with murder. With that as the background, Buffa spins a very interesting story of Hollywood, its characters, its foibles and its fables. The courtroom work assumes a substancial amount of literary license as it relates to the manner in which the attorneys ask questions, but it is certainly more interesting than sticking to the real rules. It is a book which keeps moving, asks questions and leaves you wondering and thinking about it after it is over. Not a bad result.	2003-09-26

In this case the young daughter of a US Marshall (Tim Rackley)has been brutally murdered. The perpetrator is quickly caught and in a chilling confrontation with Rackley, alludes to the possibility that he was not acting alone. Through mishandling of the investigation, arrest and entry of the perps house by the police, he goes free<BR>and it is not long after that Rackley is contacted by a member of The Committee. The Committee is a vigalante group who plan to right wrongs such as has happened to Tim. They all have a story to tell about how they have been victimized by &quot;the system&quot; and they have developed the ability to investigate potential miscarriages of justice and if they decide that the case warrants it, to carry our vengance. Rackley is the missing link to their plan. They need an executioner. How he is turned from a law enforcement officer to a vigilante enforcer and how he deals with this contradiction in his life and his continuing investigation in to who killed his daughter is compelling reading that you will not want to put down. If you are looking for a mind twister and a book that will make you think, this is about as good as it gets.	2003-09-16

If there was one feeling that I had to put aside while reading the book it was that I should be making notes on the chapters as there was surely going to be a test in the near future.<br />Politics has always been an interest of mine and Maine politics has been a consuming one for a part of my life as I served eight years in municipal government as a city councilman and mayor and was elected to two terms as Chair of the Maine Republican State Committee following my municipal service. I have been active in several gubernatorial campaigns in varying capacities as well as most of Bill Cohen's many campaigns going back to the time when we were both mayors of our respective cities. <br />The book that Pothom has produced is an analysis of what he deems to be the seminal elections of each decade since 1940 and in it he also weaves through the years the lessons that were learned or not learned by those that were invoved in &quot;this splendid game. <br />If you were any kind of a player during those decades, you are most likely mentioned in the book. In fact the book reminded me of many people whose names had dimmed in my memory and also revealed to me that people I had known growing up were involved in Maine politics in ways I did not know, If you are from Oregon, some of the details of the past might make your eyes tend to close from time to time, but if you are from here or have been here &quot;from away&quot; for some time, you will find it interesting to realize how much you have forgotten.<br />From the 1970's on, Potholm brings a special perspective to the matters he writes about as he wasin the middle of all of it in one capacity or another.However, this is not a chatty, tell-all about Maine politics. It is an analysis and a chronicle of a system in the poltical microcosim of Maine. That a state with Maine small population has harbored and nurtured some of the larger political names in US history remains a mystery to me, but it is a fact. Margaret Chase Smith, Edmund Sixtus Muskie, William Cohen and George Mitchell are clearly in the elite section of such people. But their stories and the stories of other elections have hundreds of names invoved in that melange of political activity. In stirring and disecting the melange, Potholm has no peer. <br />If you lived through those times you will enjoy a studious analysis of what you thought you already knew. If politics is something you are considering, this is required reading. No matter your reason for reading this book, you will be the wiser for it and I'm pretty sure there will be no test.	2003-08-29

Huston has written another top flight novel about the world we live in. Well, we all live in it, but few of us experience it like Kent Rathman,a/k/a Rat, who is simply the best counter terrorisim person in the service of the United States. So why is he on trial? Charged with manslaughter of a terrorist. The answer to that question is a rich mix of characters. Politicians, military people, terrorists, the media and on and on are the components of a novel which you will not want to put down. Huston catches the biases and fears of many in this country on one of the burning issues of our time and gives the reader both a terrific read and many things to think about.	2003-08-21

They have some nutty relations, they are having problems with their love life, someone is often trying to hurt them and there is always a mystery or two that needs solving. Bubbles is a hairdresser/reporterette rather than a PI, but the stories are similar. I found this to be an entertaining but light read.

I enjoyed some of her movies: On Golden Pond, Guess Who Is Coming to Dinner, The Lion in Winter and The African Queen to name a few. But I don't believe I saw any of her earlier movies such as Philideplhia Story, Adam's Rib or the many others that made up her lengthy and heralded career. I took an intrest in her during a conversation I had back in the mid-1980's with an old friend, Cynthia McFadden. Yes, THAT Cynthia McFadden of ABC News fame.<br /><br />At that time she had graduated from Bowdoin College with all of the academic honors one could receive as well as Columbia University Law School and was working for Fred Friendly's Media and Society Seminars as Executive Producer. During that conversation she told me how she had been \\"essentially adopted\\" by Katharine Hepburn and how she had become a big part of Ms. Hepburn's life. All very heady stuff for a young woman from Auburn, Maine.<br /><br />I hoped that Scott Berg's tribute to his friend Katharine Hepburn would give me an insight into the life she was leading during the time Cindy came to know her and some insight into her past as well. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />This is an emminently readable and lovingly crafted tribute to a dear friend. You are priviy to many conversations between author and subject to the point of where you feel you are evesdropping. You learn about her foibles, her fears, her philosophy of life and you do so in a most direct and interesting way. I found the book hard to put down and at the conclusion, felt that I had indeed known Katharine Hepburn. I dare say you will also. She is a most intriguing friend.	2003-08-02

However, I indulge my interest by following the Boston Red Sox, which is to say that I have a love/hate relationship with the game depending on how things are going with the Old Towne Team. Recently a friend put me on to this book and I am eternally grateful for the recommendation as things have been going on in baseball that I have been blissfully unaware of and finding out about them was both entertaining and informative.<br />The recent success of the Oakland Athletics is something I knew about, if for no other reason than they raised hell with Boston's efforts to secure a wild card spot. Billy Beane? Never heard of him. Not as a baseball player (not many others did either) or as GM of the Oakland A's. <br />Michael Lewis has made sure that we all know about Billy in this eminently readable account of how a young general manager takes players that no one else wants or appreciates and using an approach that has been around for some time devised by Bill James turns the A's into a force to be reckoned with. And he does it with little or no money by the standards of the bigger franchises.<br />The part of the book where James's theories are explained can be a bit dry, but the book really sizzles when we get into the stories of the players. We are permitted into the drafting process and given an inside look into the acquisition of some of the A's key players and the mind of Billy Bean as he wheels and deals to trade for players whom he needs to fill in the blanks in an organization which appears to have many. It is funny, it is instructive, it is irreverant and it is very, very readable.<br />There are a lot of traditional wisdoms in baseball and this book exposes many of them. If you want to understand what is happening with teams such as the A's, the Red Sox and the Blue Jays, this book is required reading.	2003-07-28

Yet, as soon as I began to learn of the game of baseball and the Boston Red Sox they became a part of my enjoyment of the game. After my first trip to Fenway to see the Sox play the PHILADELPHIA ATHLETCS, I returned home with an envelope of 8 x 10 pictures of each player on the team whom I arranged on my bedroom wall in the order in which they batted. Pitchers had their own spot and the subs were rotated in and out of the lineup. But the above four were almost always in the starting lineup. So for one who has been a member of Red Sox Nation from the time he learned about baseball, these men have been a part of my life and memory. <br />What a treat it was to have the author explore their memories of the beginning of their friendship and explain how it has endured for all time. Those were different times. So different that the bond that these men forged could never happen now in today's free agent, designated hitter, over expanded game. They came from humble beginnings; they were joined by fate as much as anything else and yet they cared for one another, not just while playing baseball, but for the rest of their lives. The glue that held them together was Ted Williams. &quot;The greatest hitter that ever lived&quot; was a man you either understood and loved or a man you could not get away from fast enough. He did not suffer fools or people who did not understand the game, but in his own way he understood the importance of friends and that friendship is not for convenience, but for life.<br />So, thanks to the author, I got to know more about my childhood heroes, but more importantly I got reminded about what is important about how we live our lives, caring for those we love and remembering to take the time to smell the roses.	2003-07-25

It was after watching a one hour tv show about the making of the move based on this book, that I decided I had waited long enough, if not too long.<br />Laura Hillenbrand has reached back in time and written an account of such detail and interest that you feel as though you have lived the experience yourself when you finally have finished.<br />There are four main focuses of the story. The owner, the trainer, the jockey and of course, the horse. I suspect that after Seabiscuit, each reader will rank them differently in interest, but all of them are truly that.<br />You will laugh, you will tear up and you will read the accounts of some of the races with an increased heartbeat as Hillenbrand captures the moments in the written word better that movie camera as she sees and writes about what is in the heart of the four major subjects. <br />At the end, you wish you could have lived through it yourself and then as you reflect on it, thanks to an exceptional job of writing, you realize that you have. Don't wait for the movie. Read the book.	2003-07-20

Harry Bosch is back, as we all knew he would be,notwithstanding the fact that he has retired from the police department. That does not mean that he has stoped doing police work however, and a call from a former colleague gets him back in the game of trying to solve a crime that has been eating at him since before he retired. In doing so, two unsolved crimes from the past become intertwined and it is left to Harry to peel the onion, layer by layer, until the matter is solved. I thought the first third or so of the book was slow to develop, however once he gets into his stride the book moves very nicely. It seems that we have not read the last of Harry's exploits and that is good news for those of us who have come to enjoy and admire him.	2003-07-11

The six are a mixed bunch: an ex-husband, a shameless lawyer, a newspaper reporter, a hired killer, an assistant state attorney and a mystery person that no one can locate. There is no apparant reason that she would have left a dime to any of the people listed, much less 46 million dollars. But of course, there is a catch. She leaves the money to the one amoung those listed who is the last one left alive.<br />After the reading of the will is when the fun begins and the blood starts to flow. <br />Jack Swytech, a Miami criminal defense lawyer has been hired by one of the beneficiaries, Tatum Knight.

Tatum's line of business is that of a hired killer, although he claims to have retired from that line of work for a few years.  <br />It turns out that a couple of weeks before Sally was murdered, she tried to hire Tatum to kill her. He claims he turned it down. Others are not so sure. <br />Grippando has done a masterful job with the interaction bewteen the beneficiaries as the plotting and scheming go on to convince others to drop out of the running. And then people start dying.<br />Who is behind the scheming and killing are not revealed until the very end of the book and the reader is kept very much in the dark until that time when all becomes clear.

He is incapable of doing anything that is muted, but writes in bold dashing narrative about one of his favorite subjects the Courtney clan of South Africa and the peoples of the region as well.<br />I have lost count of the number of novels he has written, but I could go check because I have them all. I think his best writing has been about the Courtneys and he has done it in a most interesting way in that the latest three books about them, Birds of Prey, Monsoon and Blue Horizons are about the origins of the clan. These have been written long after he has written about the progeny of the Courtneys in numerous books whech describe their exploits to the present time.<br />Others have told the story line of this book in the reviews that appear here and my recounting it once again will not add or detract from your decision to obtain the book. What I will say is that reading a Wilbur Smith novel is the closest thing to reliving the history of the times as you are likely to find. He mixes all of the elements, action, intrigue, and passion into a delectable concoction and delivers it with the master's touch.	2003-06-20

The characters are interesting, believable and command your attention. However, you don't read Dale Brown without getting your regular dose of Patrick McClanahan and his latest additions to the United States ariel arsenal. Given the realities of todays military and politicians, it is doubtful that McLanahan would still be wearing a uniform unless it was orange, however, in Dale Brown's world he is the Energizer Bunny of the Air Force. The technological explanation of the weapons systems can get a bit daunting and the repeating of past stories to explain current situations and characters gets a little old, but Mr. Brown clearly likes the genre and continues to do it well.	2003-06-12

I have loved the Kirk McGarvey novels by David Hagberg and I was really looking forward to this one. In this story, McGarvey has been nominated by the president to be head of the CIA (DCI). Some in the Senate Committee that hold hearings on his nomination are less than pleased with this turn of events, but someone else is even less enthusiastic and attempts are made on McGarvey's life as well as that of his wife, daughter and his trusted side kick Otto Rencke. It seems that long ago in Russia a plot was hatched to kill McGarvey if he was ever nominated to this position and trick is to find out who it is that is trying to kill him and how they are planning to do it. I found the plot to be very slow moving, the characters somewhat wooden and the whole story to be a huge disappointment. The mystery of who is trying to kill him doesn't turn out to be that much of a mystery either. I wish I could report otherwise, but that is how I see it.	2003-05-18

That is what this book is all about. Bringing those that need to be brought to justice to that end, one way or another.<br />As the story continues, there are attacks in the Middle East on Moslem places of worship for which an extremist group called The Hand of God takes the credit. While these attacks move the Arab countries closer to war with Isreal, it is clear to some that a shadowy figure by the name of Hashim Nidal is the one behind the attacks. Hashim is the son of Abu Nidal and is also one of the masterminds of the kidnapping of the President of the United States and the slaughter of almost all of his Secret Service protection. One problem for those trying to track him down is that no one knows what he looks like other than he has \\"silver\\" eyes. Scott Harvath, the lone SS Agent to survive the attack has looked into those eyes and nearly failed to live to tell the story. Others are not so fortunate. Fans of the CIA will not be happy with the pattern of ineptitude that is painted concerning their part of the undertaking, but every hero must have his hurdles to overcome and the CIA is clearly one of them for Harvath. The story moves around various parts of the world as the cycle of violence grows and the danger of all out war in the Middle East builds. This has all of the bells and whistles of the first book with some new and interesting characters and the liklihood that the whole story has still not been told. That is very good news for Thor fans.	2003-05-12

It had all of the ingredients that people like Ludlum, Clancy,Flynn and Cussler like to mix into their stories. There is a dastardly villian - a brave and handsome hero - an interesting cast of characters, some villians, some brave men and women - a love interest - intrigue - adventure - action and a turning and twisitng plot that will keep you interested to the end.<br />Scott Harvath, a Secret Service Agent is part of the detail that is protecting the President and his daughter while on a skiing vacation in Utah. A conspiracy at the highest levels of government causes the skiing party to be ambushed and only Harvath, the President and his daughter survive the assault. However, the President has been kidnapped and the remainder of the book deals with Harvath's crusade to avenge his fallen comrades and recover the President alive. How he goes about that makes for interesting and page turning reading. This book is  the first in a series of at least two as there is a sequel which has been released and which I will be reviewing shortly. It's good to have another top flight action writer on the scene.	2003-05-12

His writing is so compeling and the stories so convoluted that I am sure I would wake in a cold sweat more often than not. The Vanished Man only adds to the mystique. The central theme of the book is magic - illusion - slight of hand - tricks - some used by the central character - some used by others as you will see. The story is an education into that world and as usual, it puts Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs to the supreme test in more ways than one in catching the killer(s). This is a book that has more twists, turns and seeming endings than the reader would think possible. But, as usual, Deaver does his thing and puts up another 5 star winner for all to read and enjoy. Don't pass on this one!	2003-04-25

What starts out as a weekend on Cape Cod for Coyne and his girlfriend, Evie Banyon ends abruptly with the murder of a man who is apparently stalking her. Following a grilling by the gendarmes both are allowed to leave and return home to Boston and shortly thereafter, Edie disappears. Searching for her, Coyne travels to Cortland, MA, the home town of the murdered man and a place where Edie used to work. The remainder of the story takes place there with numerous interesting characters, twists and turns in the plot along with some surprizes and an interesting ending. Mr. Tapply's writing shows polish and style and the reader is swept along through the labyrinth he has created for his characters in a most enjoyable way.	2003-04-19

(again) She is appointed to represent John Dupre who is accused of two murders, the second of which was his court appointed lawyer who was in a locked down interview room with a guard watching. Tough case to win, right? Well, things are not always what they seem and in this novel that is much more than a pretty phrase. This story has more layers than an onion and as the writer peels them off we are suprised, a bit baffled, and somewhat astounded as to how this plays out. Margolin has been consistently reliable as an excellent novelist and this book changes nothing in that regard.	2003-04-17

Gabriel Allon, a master art restorer and an assasin of the Mossad returns for his third encounter with The Leopard. The background is the dark secrets of the Vatican and the Holocoast and how they entertwine. A new Pope has come to power and he is determined to right the wrongs of the past. Standing in his way is a secret society known as the Crux Vera (True Cross)who have decided that the way to stop the probelms about to be caused by what they term \\"The Accidental Pope\\" is to employ the services of The Leopard and have him killed. Allon is investigating the murder of Benjamin Stern, who as it turns out was on to the story of Pope Pius XII's involvement in the events of the days in the past. How his investigation and discoveries peel away layer after layer of history and expose him and others to great danger is a story best read and not recounted here.

This one however, although containing all the characters left a lot to be desired. As others have said, the prologue pretty much tells you where this book is going and then it seems to take forever to get there. Having made the trek you are left wondering if it was worth the effort. The first law may be survival, but the way it is portrayed in this novel leaves a bad taste in the mouth.	2003-03-29

However, once there, this book really takes off and tells it like it is. I have been involved in the type of litigation portrayed in the book and there is much more fact than fiction in the telling of how this type of litigation is handled and the forces that drive the results. It is not a pretty picture and while the book gets melodramatic in places, it does give people a glimpse of what goes on in this type of lawsuit and what drives the participants. I found this to be an interesting read and worthy of recommending.	2003-03-08

Cole spent most of the books getting off one liners while doing detective work for a series of quirky clients and Joe Pike was always there to save his bacon if real muscle was needed.It was the sort of thing you would grab in paperback for an airplane ride, but not the type of book you would invest hardcover money in. Well, with his three most recent books, LA Requiem, The Hostage and Demolition Angel, Robert Crais became an author worth reading. He continues his growth with his latest in the Cole series. In this story, Cole's girlfriends 12 year old son is kidnapped while in Cole's care. Why he was kidnapped and by whom becomes the focus of the ensuing investigation and the answers do not come easily. The kidnappers seem to know about some dark secret in Cole's service as an Army Ranger in Viet Nam. As the clues are uncovered the story gets more convoluted and the reader becomes more and more involved in the plot. Crais reintroduces LAPD Detective Carol Starkey from Demolition Angel in this book and we get the feeling that we will be seeing her again. I continue to look forward to this author's development and so should you.	2003-03-06

A guy that had more one liners than Milton Berle and a seedy cast of clients who were entertaining, but not that interesting a read. It was airport novel stuff. No more. With his last three books, The Hostage, Demolition Angel and LA Requiem Mr. Crais has become a serious writer and one capable of keeping you up late into the night. This is such a book. I don't know what pill he took, but I would like to have a supply of them. In this book, Elvis is in charge of his girlfriend's 12 year old son when he is kidnapped. (the kid) Why it was done takes a while. Who did it gets revealed in good time. How Elvis and the ubiquitous Joe Pike deal with the sinister characters they are up against is always entertaining.

The title is grossly misleading. In fact after reading the book one wonders why it was named as it was because it has so little to do with the plot or action in the book. Madriani becomes some kind of private detective in this book after a friend of his dies in a hail of bullets while talking to a client outside the courthouse before the client is to be arraigned. That's as close as this book ever gets to a courtroom. The rest of it entails Madriani trying to find out what his friend was involved with and why he was killed, which nearly gets Madriani killed. The answer is not particularly interesting and how it is revealed is less so. There really is little to recommend this book....and I don't.	2003-02-21

He does write the shortest chapters of any modern author (even shorter than Robert B. Parker's, but all that does is add white space and pages. In this book Alex cross is embarking on his \\"last case\\" to prove that a friend of a friend is being framed for a murder. Alas, he fails, but in the process realizes that someone is going to a lot of trouble to frame former Viet Nam veterans for murder and being very successful. We learn early on who is doing it, but not who is ordering the killing. Many dead bodies later we find out the answer which is somewhat predictable and not very startling. I was given this book as a gift. I am thankful that I did not shell out hard cash for it. If you like this author, I suggest the library or waiting for paper back.	2003-02-14

This is a cleverly concieved story about an attempt by The Mob to infiltrate the PGA Tour and how one man's courage (and luck) exposes the effort and brings it down. It is not so much about golf, although there is enough of that and of inside information on the Tour to satisfy most golfers, as it is a mystery. Jack Austin is a 10 year non-winning member of the PGA Tour who is drawn in to a dangerous game by a fellow tour member who is being black mailed to alter his scores for the benefit of some very unsavory gamblers. The effort nearly costs Austin and his finacee, a golf commentator for CBS, their lives.

The story takes place in one day and involves about a half dozen people who have no idea how their lives are becoming interlinked by events. Were he to write the same story today, it would probably be tied together a bit differently and would be fleshed out a little more, but all the ingredients are there and if you have been a fan of this author, it is well worth your time to read this one.	2002-12-24

I read it in one day if starting around 2 PM and finishing around midnight count as a day. I could not put it down and I was sorry when it was finished. I wanted it to go on.<br />This look into the wierd, but for them normal, world of the very wealthy who live on the island of Manhatten, should be pause for concern amongst those of us who have been raised by our parents, sent to public schools and more or less believed that is how it is generally done.<br />The child in this case is a four year old by the name of Grayer. We ae never told how he gets this unusual name, but we assume it has family roots attached. Grayer, is a somewhat spoiled, somewhat screwed up litle boy when the protagonist of the novel is hired to be his \\"nanny\\" during the normal 8-5 day of the city dweller. However, as \\"Nanny\\" quickly learns, she is there as much to protect Greyer from the rules and regulations of his overbearing mother as anything else.<br />It is sad to think that the children of the very rich in this country are raised in such a defective cocoon, but reading about it is as fascinating as I can possibly describe.<br />What makes the book is how the authors describe the experience. There is little I can say to prepare you for it, except to cite the old Bette Davis chestnut, \\"Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy ride.\\" This was one of the most fascinating books I have read in some time. If you are looking for a book that will carry you away for a bit, teach you about a segment of society you are unlikely to ever be a part of and entertain your thoroughly in the process, this is your book.

It was given to me for Christmas a year ago and I regret not having picked it up sooner to read through it. The central character wakes up in Washington's Union Station with what he thinks is a bad hangover, dressed like a bum and not knowing who he is. After many chapters, that issue is solved only to open up other questions, most notably why has someone tried to erase his memory? He is able to piece together that he is a rocket scientist associated with the Explorer I launch, that he has an OSS background, and that he came to Washington because of concerns he had about the integrity of the Explorer program. Someone didn't want him revealing what he knew, but who and why?<BR>The answers to those questions come in an interesting way and as they are revealed, his life is put in considerable danger as is the safety of the Explorer I launch. I have enjoyed most, but not all of Mr. Follett's books, but this one is a clear winner.	2002-12-19

The commercial reviews above describe more than adequately the story line, but what they don't impart is the impact of Smith's writing style as he weaves his story as though he had lived through it. It has all of the usual ingedients of a Smith story, i.e., intrigue, betrayal, sex, suspense, violence, cruelty, love, superstition, etc. You will find it hard to put down and when it ends you will be looking for the sequel which I hope is forthcoming.	2002-12-15

If it is not a tell all, it will do 'til one comes around. Most of the problem is with alcohol...we hear of interventions, wild partys, stupid episodes of behavior...yet through it all...even after an intervention which sent him to Betty Ford...one of the staff told him before he left that he was not an alcoholic but an abuser of alcohol. What that distinction is remains lost to me but was understood by Ben. No matter. You wonder how CBS managed to produce a cohesive telecast of the Masters or any other tournament they were assigned to based on Ben's recollections. He also ran into some world travelers that he thought behaved badly. It is a &quot;tell all&quot; from one who is still in the dog house for telling all about his opinion of women's golf and the difference betwen the men's game and theirs. No matter that he had that just right,,,he was PC'd out and the world of golf broadcasting is the worse for it. I miss him behind the microphone, but the book goes a bit long.	2002-11-27

In this book, he gives us a thumb nail sketch of his analysis of the various aspects of this thing we all enjoy, Democracy. He does it an a very insightful and entertaining way. It will mean a bit more to those who have been in Maine during the events he recounts, but there is still plenty here for any student of politics. Other than his wife or the sight of an eight point deer in his sights, nothing gets Potholm's juices running like politics. I would love to have taken classes from him, but I have had the next best thing. I have watched him work from the inside which is an education in itself. Get a glimpse of what makes him tick in this book. He will make you think, he will make you laugh and best of all, he will get you involved.	2002-11-15

All of his yarns are interesting, some are humorous, many are instructional, gleaned from 50 years of flying. Reading this reminds me of many days when weather or some other matter outside of our control found us sitting around the FBO telling our stories and listening to others. Bill's stories are well worth listening to.	2002-11-11

My suspicion is that those who did not like this book are admirers of our 42nd President and that the underlying conduct of the First Lady's husband is a bit too Clintonian for them. Too bad, because this book takes on Washington political types, celebrity lawyers, the press, the fickle American public, and &quot;trials of the century&quot; and in the process spins as good a piece of satirical humor as I have read in some time. Trust me, it is a book you will look forward to reading and hate putting down. Go for it.	2002-11-08

However, this one is clearly a stand alone central character. Henry Pierce, is a genius who is developing a molecular delivery system of some sort which, if succesful will make him a jillionaire and his company make MicroSoft look like a Model T Ford. So, with all of marbles on the line as he gets near to filing his patent and convincing a \\"whale\\" (a person with millions to invest) to pony up 30 million or so to enable them to complete their research, Henry gets distracted.<br />We are asked to believe that after breaking up with his girlfriend and moving to a new apartment that the discovery that his new phone number used to be that of a very georgeous escort service model gets him into some sort of x-rated frenzy as he starts to receive her calls. The discovery comes near the end of the week. By Monday he can have the number changed and he won't be getting her calls anymore. But instead of going to the lab to do some much needed work on the invention, he spends the time trying to get in contact with the model whom he has become convinced may be in some danger.<br />To give this some credence, the author creates a piece of past history where Henry's sister suffered a similar fate from such a profession, but this seems to be a thin connection for what Henry goes through.<br />We get a pretty good introduction to the world of the escort service as Henry goes further and further into the maze which we eventually find out was created by others to acquire the invention. It is a deadly maze with a bloody conclusion, but somehow all the suspense and such didn't do a lot for me as I kept saying to myself, \\"no one this bright would ever be doing this at this time.\\" If you can get past that, as some other reviewers have, then you will probably enjoy the mystery and suspense. For me, I hope the next novel from this author will be about Harry Bosch.	2002-11-04

I love Hiaasen's novels about Florida and all of the zany characters he creates to tell his pro-ecology stories. When I saw he had written another one I reflexivly one clicked to have it sent to me. When I got it I thought it was a tad smaller in size than the usual novel one buys in hardcover and the print seemed to be a little large, but no matter as I dove into the saga of Roy Eberhardt. <br />I was perhaps a couple of chapters into the book when I noticed on the fly leaf that it was a Children's Book of the Month Club selection. Really? Well, I was enjoying and as I continued to read through it I continued to be drawn along with the story of the new boy from Montana being introduced to both the beauty of Florida and it's not so beautiful experiences with developers. <br />In this story the guys in black work for a Pancake House conglomerate called, Mother Paula's All American Pancake House. They intend to open their 469th family style restaurant on a piece of property in Coconut Grove. The fences are up. The construction trailer is on the site. The bulldozers have arrived. All appears to be ready for construction to begin. Then things start to happen. First all the survey markers are pulled up and all the stake holes are filled in.The air is let out of the construction vehiles tires. Alligators (small ones) are put in the out house toilets. No work is being done. The date for a grand opening is approaching. Who is doing this and why are no mystery to the reader, but they are a serious question to the construction foreman, Curly, police officer Delinko and Curly's boss at headquarters, Chuck Muckle. Of course, Mother Paula's is about to be constructed on land on which there a bunch of burrowing owls. Mother Paula's people know it. No one else does until a very unusual \\"hero\\" sets in motion a wonderful string of events which leads to a predictable but very humorous conclusion.<br />It may have been written for children, but what the heck - we are all kids at heart.	2002-11-02

It is populated with characters - funny ones - serious ones - dangerous ones - stupid ones and many very curvy ones. As usual, Mike has an ear for how people in this genre carry themselves and while the plot of the story - whether or not Jammer Molloy, son of the owner of the New York Hawks will be allowed to become an owner of the team after his daddy dies and leaves it to him, is never in serious doubt, it is the &quot;how&quot; of making this happen that is entertaining and not &quot;whether.&quot;.

He also has a whole lot of talent in writing engaging sports fiction. If you are a Red Sox fan, (as I am) you will especially like the insights into what we go through every year. If you are a baseball fan you will also love this \\"inside look\\" at what goes on behind the scenes at the major league level. The story line in not unique. Forty year old former star pitcher (Showtime Charlie Stoddard) who's arm is shot finds a \\"guru\\" who restores his physical prowess and tries for another shot at \\"The Show.\\" His former catcher is now the Manager of the Red Sox. They are both in love with Grace MacKenzie. Charlie had the good fortune to marry her and the bad judgement to cheat on her - big time - so she is now his ex - and the mother of their son who is the newest phenom for - guess who - the Boston Red Sox. Grace and Charlie still talk. The son hates Charlie and carries enough hate for both himself and his mom. The Sox had a big lead on the hated Yankees, but as the season draws to a close - the lead has shrunk. Mixing these characters and many others into the pot in a believeable and entertaining way is something that Lupica has done in a most entertaining fashion. You will smile, you will laugh out loud and you will hate to put this book down until you finish it.	2002-10-23

The first was too critical of the author to publish the review, or so they advised me. Let's start with what this book is not. It is not an attempt by the author to be funny. It is not a novel which displays the least understanding of the Master's golf tournament. It is not a novel which displays the least understanding of the game of golf - it's rules - it's nomenclature or it's history. It is - in short - the worst novel by a successful author that I have ever read and I have enjoyed Mr. Bernhardt's other efforts. It deserves no stars. It should be avoided at all costs. Fair warning!	2002-10-20

The Risk Pool is the story of Ned Hall and his coming of age in Mohawk, NY. Ned's father Sam first saw his son after being kidnapped from a poker game by his father-in-law at gun point (\\"Deal me out a couple of hands\\") and taken to the hospital where his wife lay with young Ned on her breast. It must have been, as young Ned recounts, \\"a tender moment\\".<br />Sam Hall, we are told at the beginning knew what he wanted to do when the war he was serving in was over. He wanted to drink and whore and play the horses. That was a plan that Sam dedicated himself to for the rest of his life.<br />What Sam's life plan does to the lives of those around him as he bounces through life like a pin ball is described through the eyes of his son, Ned. It is funny, honest, pathetic, touching, and outrageous. It is also compelling. The man who took Sam to first see his son with a pistol in his ear, always said there were four seasons in Mohawk. Fourth of July, Mohawk Fair, Eat the Bird and Winter and the book is divided into sections bearing those names as Ned grows and the story unwinds.<br />Give yourself a treat and read this book.	2002-10-19

I urge you to read it for a full presentation of what this book is about.<br />I bring an interesting perspective to this book about an Episcopal priest who is charged with the murder of the Senior Warden of the parish and who is defended by an attorney who is a member of the choir. I happen to be an Episcopalian, an attorney, a member of the choir of my church and the Senior Warden. For that reason alone, I was interested to see where this story was going.<br />Well, let's say first that Father Beale of this book is no Father Timothy, of Jan Karon fame. He has a temper, some say a \\"muderous\\" one, he is on the edge of many contentious issues that the Church is dealing with at this time, his vestry wants him to resign and he is an advocate for the Liberated Christian lifestyle. I'll let you read the book and see how that fits into the story.<br />I found the book to be an interesting whodunit. You know it isn't Father Beale, but who the heck is it? That is revealed late in the book along with the presentation to the reader of a an issue that many may not have thought about before reading this book. I guarantee you will think about it afterwards. I leave it for you to find out what it is. Well worth reading!	2002-10-05

I have, as an interested observer, hung around a fair amount of the kinds of tournaments that JP played in during that year described in the book, as an observer. I have seen some interesting talents and even more interesting characters. They are people you will probably never see on the PGA Tour, but you would die for some of their abilities as golfers. What keeps them in the hinterlands of the golf tours is \\"The Fine Green Line\\" which Newport describes with grace, insight and humor. This is an interesting and highly entertaining insight into the tournament game, the game of golf itself and how it blends into one's life. I recommend it without hesitation to those who find the game to have a compelling fascination, regardless of your own personal talents.	2002-10-04

They did not stay crossed for long as they were too busy turning pages. This book is somewhat topical for those who are keeping an eye on the Middle East and also the Far East, but topical or not it spins a tale that grabs the reader at once and returns many old characters or their progeny into action. Detailing the story lines takes unnecessary space, If you have been a fan of this author - welcome back on board. If he is new to you, not to worry - this book stands alone and will probably send you into looking into other books he has written. the only one I would avoid is the one I mentioned at the outset.

It has an interesting and topical basis in the crime and corruption that can surround the taking of a private company public in the days of greed that we have been and are stil living through, to some extent. Add to the mix that the company is Russian and that the owner is as amoral as he is ambitious and then add to that mix those that are trying to prevent it from happening and the pages are starting to turn. The focus of the book, Jett Gavallon, a former F-16 jockey and now a high tech entrepreneur is suspected of some very serious crimes in his association with Konstantin Kirov, the owner of Mercury Broadband.  How that all meshes together is what makes this book such a good read. I was fortunate to have a weekend during which I could really sit with this book and let the story just run. I throughly enjoyed it and I suspect you will too.	2002-09-15

I am always suspicious of books that are written by two people and having read these authors for the first time, my opinion has not changed. This book gets off to a very good start and is merrily rolling along when it starts to bog down in historical back ground. From that point on it has it's moments, but I found the going somewhat uninteresting and by the time I had waded to the end, only to have the authors explain to me what I had read I was more than a bit tired of the entire matter. I found that character development was uneven and sometimes contrary. I had expected to recommend this book based upon the early chapters, but having seen it through, I suspect you may have better ways to spend your time (and money).	2002-09-02

John Winestein wishes he had written this book. It chronicles what it is like as a bottom feeder in experience, as well as how that all gets changed around through &quot;blood, sweat and tears.&quot; The two principals of the book, Rich Beem, aspiring PGA Pro and Steve Duplantis, his caddie are real people with real problems and real answers,... sometimes. Beem has burst even further onto the PGA scene since this was written by winning The International and the PGA Championship in back to back outings in 2002. That will no doubt be the subject of another book, but it cannot surpass the brutal honesty and interest of this first effort. You must not pass this by, if golf is a part of your life.	2002-08-28

You are a former SS agent who has become a very successful corporate type - worth a billlion or so. Your wife has died; you have fallen in love with a subordinate employee; and you have to deal with this suicide when you least are prepared to do so. However you recognize that it could not be such - a friend in the service confirms that and identifies the person behind the killing. i.e. the President of the United States. Your focus is to kill him and to do that you have to penetrate the Forth Perimenter of his security. You lay out a plan to do so and survive and after doing it things start to unravel. How they unravel and how that is delt with is the stength of the novel. It is a fine read.	2002-08-13

I liked this one a lot inspite of some extraneous action in the \\"halls of power\\" which is never fully explained or developed. I don't really care about some of the political power plays within the administration and they don't do much to move the story along. I am a private pilot so any book which involves flying always attracts my interest and the flying in this book is well done, as it should be because the prinicpal pilots are none other than members of the elite US Navy Demonstration Team -The Blue Angels and the author is a Top Gun graduate. <br />Lt. Ed Stovic while involved in testing Algeria's claim to a 200 mile territorial limit shoots down an Algerian MIG-23. While the circumstances of the shoot down are less than heroic to my thinking, Stovic is treated as a hero by his nation and the Navy and Stovic himself is more than happy to bask in the glory. This changes when he learns that Ismael Nezzar, the brother of the Algerian pilot who was killed in the action is not taking the loss well and in fact has decided to kill Stovic.<br />Ismael was studying in the United States (where else) when all of this begins and he therefore gets to watch the combat camera film of his brother's MIG being blown out of the sky every 10 minutes on CNN. He later learns of the fairly horrific way his brother died as he tried to escape from his burning plane. Initially, if one is to have sympathy between the two characters, Ismael has some things going for him. <br />Enter Kent Rathman, the third major character in the book. Rathman a/k/a \\"Rat\\". Rathman is the consumate counter-terrorist operative whose prior history (Navy SEAL) is never fully explained, but wherever he acquired the knowledge to put together an anti-terrorist organization which is more effective than those of major governments is beside the point. If the Rat is on your case, you are in serious trouble. The Rat is assigned by the White House to protect Stovic. Just to bring it full circle they were classmates at the Naval Academy.<br />It isn't long before Rat is earning his money in protecting Stovic. Then, soon after his return to the States Stovic is offerred a chance to fly Number 6 for The Blue Angels. The words \\"no thanks\\" never occur to him even though they do to his wife, who is less than thirlled with this assignment.<br />Ismael sees the opportunity, not only to avenge his brother, but to make a poitical statement in organizing an attack against the flying team at one of the most prestigioius air shows in the world, The Paris Air Show. <br />The balance of the book is a cat and mouse hunt for the Algerians whom everyone knows are waiting to bring the Angels to earth which focuses more on Rat's character who educates Stovic about how the war against terrorisim is fought. After a particularly brutal interrogation of an Algerian by Rat which Stovic witnesses and complains about, Rat advises him: \\" Look. What you do is important. I'm just telling you that today, most of the defense of the United States is done where you don't see it. And now that you've seen just a little of it, you're shocked...The world used to fight with armies, and uniforms, and rules... Not anymore. Ever since the World Trade Center, when the War on Terrorism got going, we started seeing that things were going to be different. Snake eaters like me ARE the front lines, because there aren't any front lines. And it's dirty and it's ugly. And we're wrong now and then, just like pilots are. But were where the fight is.\\"<br />He has a point and he continues to make it throughout the book. Plenty of action for those who like this type of book. I do and I did. I think you will too.	2002-07-27

I have read all of Dale Brown's fourteen novels and, with one exception, if you buy in to his premise that has developed over time, of a private US company modifying B-52 aircraft and developing others into a frightening air armada and then flying them against other countries without US approval, then you are going to enjoy this one as well.<br />From The Flight of the Old Dog to Wings on Fire has been a long and hazardous trip for Gen. Patrick McClanahan (USAF Ret.)and many others that served with him throughout the various campaigns.<br />In this book, Skymasters has been retained by some unnamed oil producers to \\"protect their interests\\" from the quite mad King of Lybia ( a successor to Quadaffi. All the King and his henchmen want to do is steal a few billion dollars and get out of Dodge. However when he starts by murdering the President of Egypt, he sets in motion a series of events that do not work out quite as he had hoped. The non-Arabic wife of the murdered president takes her husbands murder personally and embarks on her own plans for revenge. These get wrapped up with McClanahan and his Nightstalkers whose mission to Lybia has become somewhat undone and he finds himself rescued by Egyption forces after their ship is sunk by Lybia. However, not all of the forces are rescued and some fall into the hands of the Lybians, including McClanahan's wife, Wendy. McClanahan wants his wife and men back which Brown blends with the desires of the murdered President's widow and the rest is a typical air war pot boiler that is enjoyable to read, but a bit difficult to swallow in places.<br />If this is your first Brown book, you may find this hard going in places as a fair number of assumptions are made by the author that the reader knows more about his characters than the book reveals. That said, if it is not your first Brown book and you enjoyed the others, you will like this one as well. A sequel is clearly set up in the conclusion and the possibilities it raises are very interesting indeed. Buckle your seat belts.......	2002-07-14

In scrolling through the reviews that are here, it is interesting to see the different perspectives people have. Some view the book as an informational book about sword fishing; others see it as an extension of the story told in The Perfect Storm (Linda Greenlaw was the Captain of the Andrea Gail's sister fishing boat, the Hanna Bowden); some see it as a metaphor about life as a woman in what is essentially a man's business; and some see it as proof that those who go to sea to fish are most responsible for the problems we have with fisheries and the ocean environment. Linda's oldest sister sees the book as a &quot;book length personals ad&quot; (Linda would like to get married). I bought the book thinking that I would be reading more about aspects of The Perfect Storm and instead found a compelling story from a woman who all her life wanted to be doing what she was doing and did it against great odds. Sebastian Junger referred to her as the best swordfish captain in the North Atlantic, or words to that effect, which is high praise for anyone and the zenith of such for a woman. In the book she tells you what it is like to put to sea to go swordfishing and she does it without any cleaning up of the life. She also shares her inner thoughts and makes the story very much a human tale. In the end, you will care about her very much. At least I did. She is brave, vulnerable, stubborn, funny and caring and she communicates those attributes quite well.	2002-07-08

As she uses them, her stories about lobstering are metaphors about life and she interweaves stories of how one &quot;fishes&quot; for the wily crustaceans with stories of the many crusty characters that share her &quot;High Island.&quot;<br />  She has an ear for conversations and an interesting way of telling the little stories that make life on a rock something that some hold near and dear. I believe the stories will reach people who do not live Down East, whether we be fortunate enough to live in one of the highest taxed states in the nation with the best views or not, for in the end they are all about the human condition. Undoubtedly, her older sister still consdiers her literary efforts to be a book long personals ad, as there is plenty in The Lobster Chronicles about trying to find a husband as well.<br />  Hopefully, the subject of actually landing one will be<br />the topic for a third book. This is very entertaining and worthwhile writing by an author who is only improving as she continues to find her way.	2002-07-08

This book has a very interesting set up to the plot and then, as quickly as getting pushed from a cliff into an icy stream, it launches into a very impluasable series of events as successful architect Brad Denning tries to track down and find the little brother that disappearred from his life many years before and has now returned to steal his wife, his child and his identity. The little brother's motivation for doing this is poorly fleshed out and the eventual confrontation between siblings is so wildly implausable that at the end you find yourself shaking your head and wondering...\\"Now what the hell was that all about?\\" I'd like to know the answer.	2002-06-25

Harry Bosch has been through a lot in the previous seven Michael Connelly novels that he has appeared in and this one is no exception. The discovery of the skeleton of a child by a neighborhood dog sets Harry off on an adventure to solve the mystery of who the child is, how he died and who killed him which will bring him both heartbreak and personal growth. Harry runs into the usual problems with superior officers and not so usual problems with the tracking down of the killer. At the conclusion of the book we are left to wonder what next for Harry and knowing that whatever it is, it will certainly be different. There are no slow reading chapters in this book.

To title this book Triggerfish Twist is most apropos as there is probably no finer collection of twisted personalities and story lines that you will see for some time...probably until his next book.	2002-06-21

It is also a fun read and has an interesting twist at the end. The book cover suggests it is a combination of Grisham and Finestein.

The seventh book in the Mitford series is all about love and discovery...Father Tim and his wife, Cynthia have returned to Mitford and those of us who have read the first five books (the sixth was a novella and not worth discussing) are sighing and smiling in relief that they (and we) are home. The rhythm of the town is one we are familiar with. The characters are old friends (at least most of them). Their eccentricities and foibles have been missed and we desperately need to get caught up with what has been happening in Mitford since the Kavenaugh's spent three years on Whitecap Inland in North Carolina.<br />For a man of strong intellect and true instincts, Father Tim can sometimes be his own worst enemy as he proves in the first part of the book. He is ignoring his diabetes by not exercising, eating the wrong things and &quot;forgetting&quot; to take his insulin shots or adjusting the dose himself. The result of such a course of action is both predictable and tragic. The depth of the tragedy is something he discovers as he recovers from his injuries and is told the harsh truth of what actually occurred.<br />The story is then woven around Father Tim's recovery from the accident and the depression that followed; the search for Dooley's brother; the return of The Man in the Attic; the continuing saga of Uncle Billy and Rose and the comings and goings of all of the wonderful Mitford characters.<br />This book is not fluff, however. There are many sermons, stories and words to live by scattered through the events related here. You will laugh, smile, shed a tear, and grind your teeth, but most of all and most importantly, you will care what happens. You will care deeply and when you at last close the last page you will also have grown from the experience. I guarantee it!	2002-06-14

I have read most, if not all of the Harry Bosch books by this author, although not in sequence. I felt that this one gave me as good an insight into Harry's character as one is likely to get. Harry has been suspended from duty for assaulting his commanding officer. Of course, being Harry, he had a good reason. The guy who has little or no field training completely ruined an important interrogation in which he had no business meddling in. That is the sort of thing which gets Harry's attention and coupled with his lack of respect for the man as one who should be commanding detectives, he sort of takes things into his own hands.<br />This gets Harry some time off and while he is contemplating his past conduct with the help of a psychologist, Harry decides to use the time to try and solve a very old open murder case. The murder happens to be of his own mother. Harry's Mom was a prostitute/call girl whose body was found in a dumpster. Harry was eleven at the time and living as a ward of the state.<br />With his detective skills Harry starts to stir into the past and in doing so numerous possibilities arise as to who his mother's murderer is and some of them are people in high places. This is a whodunit which will keep you up and reading, longer than you might care to and I guarantee that the answer will be only part of the surprises that await the reader. This is a fine read!	2002-06-10

This one breaks the string. The Meridean Airlines that is fashioned by the author is such a dysfunctional company and many of the people that work for it are so screwed up that the concept which is being put forth simply has no credability. <br />The story is fashioned around Flight Six of Meridean which starts in Chicago and is flying to Johannesburg, South Africa, with a stop over in London. You have the usual personal stories which make up any flight, but to spice things up once the flight gets to London, we have a Chief Flight Attendant that is a certified lunatic and the Captain of the flight is insecure, overbearing and only marginally comppetant to handle an international route. Of course getting to London was a small hoprror show of it's own, so that by the time the flight finally gets there, you have all of the ingredients among the passengers for \\"air rage.\\"<br />There is a sub-plot to the book where the US Government has determined that terrorists are planning to take over an international flight using air rage as their motivator and will then deliver the plane as a weapon to some European country. The detailing of this part of the story is somewhat tedious.<br />Well, as luck would have it, Meridean Six manages to blunder its way into becoming the scenario that everyone is afraid of and US Navy Tom Cats are dispatched to verify that the plane is being flown by highjackers and to shoot it down if it will not change course to a base in Algiers.<br />This part of the book is the only part where Nance dredges up his considerable writing skill and puts together a fairly interesting few chapters. That effort is far too late and far to little to save this book. As a private pilot who enjoys books on aviation I was sorely disappointed by this one and suggest that there are better books out there to spend your money on.	2002-06-09

This is Moby Dick light...kind of....however Captain Ahab was a more compelling character than A.J. Braswell even though the whale only took Ahab's leg (at first). This story opens with a giant Marlin taking the life of Braswell's son Tony. The Braswell's we find out much later in the book are a super dysfunctional family which could probably have been the subject of a book all by themselves without bringing Thorn and company into the mix, but what is a James Hall book without Thorn?<br />Thorn is in the process of breaking up with his naked girlfriend Casey, when an MD-11 airliner is the victim of a product demonstration by Morgan Braswell. The Braswell's failing company has developed some kind of ray gun which shuts of all the electrical systems in it's targets and Ms. Braswell is performing a demo for a potential purchaser. The unlucky MD-11 comes down in Blackwater Sound. In probably the best piece of writing in the book, Thorn is involved in rescue efforts. Events conspire from there on in to draw Thorn into the vortex of the Braswell family along with some other entertaining characters to a somewhat predictable and bloody conclusion. However, Hall always entertains and this is no exception. Not a bad beach read.	2002-05-19

Every so often I need a dose of Jack Higgins and his cast of characters headed by Sean Dillon, ex-IRA hit man now laboring for the forces of all that is right and good. With that in mind, I recently picked up a paperback of Edge of Danger and a hardcover copy of Midnight Runner and read them straight through. It was such good fun. Higgin's paints interesting villains and in creating and then slowly destroying the Rashid family, he has come up with some of his best. You know that no matter what, no matter how dire the circumstances, Dillon will prevail and always with a certain elan and a Bushmill's somewhere near by. I gave this five stars not because it is great literature, but it is vintage Higgins at the top of his writing game and with all that is going on in the world they inhabit in the real world, it is a pleasure to see the good guys carry the day.	2002-04-23

This one moves along quite nicely as the Caruso brothers, both employees of a private bank, get into more trouble than one would ever hope to be in by yeilding to the temptation to take some money that didn't belong to them because they became convinced that no one would ever know the money was taken.<br />Once the button is pushed and the money taken their world turns upside down, inside out and every which way but loose as they try to figure out what has happened to their perfect scheme and why is the Secret Service after them and how did 3 million dollars turn into 313 million dollars and where are they going to go to find the answers to these questions.<br />The answer to where is the same as the MVP of the Super Bowl shouts: &quot;I'm going to Disney World!&quot; I'm not sure that Mickey will be pleased at how The Magic Kingdom fits into all of this, but this is a good book which will keep you happily turning the pages for some time.	2002-04-16

It is a story with many facets, but essentially it is about the lives of two strong men and how the events of the time brought them together.<br />It is 1941 and Homicide Detective Sargeant Zee Bannon, LAPD is looking into what at first appears to be an accidental death. Verna Wilensky has been electrocuted by a radio falling into her bath or so it seems until the coroner discovers that her lungs are full of water. It is also discovered that the unfortunate Ms. Wilensky was the recipient of a monthly cashier's check for $500 for many years and that efforts to trace her background end abruptly in 1928. It turns out that many of the checks were drawn on banks located in the town of San Pietro. <br />The town itself has undergone quite a change since 1928, including changing it's name. It was originally founded as Eureka and during that time it was a haven for bootlegging, gambling and all of the things those activities spawn.<br />We are told the story, early on of how Eureka came to change through the activities of Thomas Brodie Culhane. Growing up poor and orphaned, Culhane becomes best friends with the son of one of the town's wealthiest men Eli Gorman, who has plans for making Eureka a proper town, free from the vice and the characters that are controlling it. The story of how he goes about that is as interesting as the rest of the book and that part of the story continues to weave itself through what follows as the investigation into the death of Ms. Wilensky continues.<br />By the time Sargeant Bannon comes calling, Brodie Culhane is the town's Sheriff and a war hero and throughout the remainder of the<BR>book the characters are intertwined until the end. Trying to relate it in outline form here would not do it justice.<br />This is the first book in a long time that after finishing it, I was tempted to reread it immediately. The characters are beautifully drawn and the story has so many interesting twists and turns that I am sure I missed something on the first time through. However, what I did not miss was one of the best reading experiences I have had in a long, long time and I read a lot and I like a lot of what I read. This is an exceptional book by an author who clearly takes the time necessary to write and tell his story.	2002-04-10

The Fuzhou Dragon nears the shores of Long Island bearing its cargo of undocumented Chinese citizens (piglets) who are being brought to America by a snakehead (smuggler) known as the Ghost. It has come by a most circuitous route and its captain believes he will be able to deliver its human cargo to the shores of the United States undetected until a fast moving radar blip alerts him to an approaching Coast Guard cutter. How could this small and unobtrusive ship have been intercepted? Who knew? <br />Back in Manhattan, Lincoln Rhyme nods in satisfaction when told by the Coast Guard that his deduction as to the location of the ship was correct. His anticipation that the ship will be routinely intercepted and boarded with the arrest of the Ghost could not have been more wrong however, and the operation spins dangerously out of control when the Ghost sabotages the ship and send her to the bottom of the ocean.<br />The Ghost and some from the ship make it to shore and the chase is on. Two chases actually. The first is the hunt for the Ghost and those who made it to shore by crime scene specialists, Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs, and the FBI, INS and NYPD. The second is the hunt for all who survived the sinking so that they can be silenced by the Ghost. <br />In his usual fashion, Deaver has created interesting characters and an intricate plot which introduces the reader to the vaguries of international smuggling as well as the importance of proper crime scene investigation. The plot twists and turns with the reader sometimes wondering if some of the good guys are really good and if some of the bad guys are really bad. Getting to that answer is a real treat for the reader.<br />If you have not found Mr. Deaver's books before, this is your lucky day. If you have, you know the good reading that awaits you. A win, win situation for all concerned.	2002-04-06

Unfortunately, the anticipation exceeded the actual event. The character who is named in the title of the book is poorly developed and actually plays a somewhat minor role for a title character. We are tantalized throughout much of the book in trying to find out the secret that led the wife of Swiss banker, Augustus Rolfe to take her life in a rather dramatic fashion at the beginning of the book. I won't spoil the intrigue, but the secret is not that difficult to figure out.<br />It also seems that, as with sequels, much time is utilized explaining to first time readers what those that read the first book already know. Such is inevitable, but it seems to happen with greater frequency in this book than necessary.<br />That all being said, this is still a pretty good read. We are drawn into the consequences of the nefarious activities of the Swiss banking community during WW II as it relates to its complicity with Adolph Hitler and stolen Jewish art. As Allon tries to unravel the reason for the murder of Rolfe and the identity of those who did it, he comes into possession of a letter which explains much, but not all, from Herr Rolfe himself from beyond the grave. The plot is interesting and while the ending is a bit pat, Daniel Silva in a four star book is better than most and worth the read.	2002-03-28

A Must Read!	&quot;The world looks different through a rifle scope.&quot;....So begins a fascinating account of one man's experiences as a member of the FBI and more specifically, it's elite Hostage Rescue Team. I had the good fortune and genuine pleasure to meet the author who spoke to a group I am a member of recently. After reading his book, I am amazed that he can maintain a sense of humor and his enthusiasim for what is a deadly serious and often unpleasant business. A former speech writer for a U.S. Congressman, Whitcomb uses his writing ability to easily convey to the reader the essense of what it takes to (1) want to join the FBI (2) actually do it and (3) become a member of the HRT. He then takes us to places we thought we had been before - Ruby Ridge - Waco - and we see them through a different lens and the perspective is jolting. Because of his enthusiasim for the subject he sometimes tells us a bit more than we really want or need to know about some of the nuts and bolts of how things are done, but you never lose a sense of awe and respect for what these people do to keep us safe. In his speech to our group he mentioned that the members of the Hostage Rescue Team are none too pleased with the current popular use of the acronym, HRT.(Hormone Replacement Therapy) Be that as it may, their hormones are clearly in proper place and alignment and you will gain some new respect for these people who operate without fanfare to catch bad guys - free the innocent - straightening things out. You will sleep a little sounder and you will thank them for their service. This is a book about very special people and some of them are on the HRT. Others support them from the homefront, which you will see as you read this, is far from easy. Rosie Whitman deserves our thanks and earns our admiration as well. What other profession expects wives to accept without question their husband's sudden absense without explanation and without information as to whether it will be a day, a week or a month or more? And they know that they always travel in harm's way. It takes real love, committment and understanding and Chris Whitman is blessed with this in abundance.	2002-03-16

While most of the principal characters in this book, dead and alive, are lawyers, it is not necessary to the story. A son who is called to his father's bedside, arrives too late and finds a handwritten will naming him executor and boxes full of money totaling $3,000,000. His father, a retired (by the electorate) judge never made much money during his life and what he did make, he mostly gave to charity. We spend too much time watching the son figure out if the money is traceable or phoney and when he is staisfied that it is not, watching him move it around from place to place. He decides not to tell his black sheep younger brother about he money as he is a recovering from everything individual and not particularly trustworthy.  However, someone knows he has the money and sends him cryptic messages about this knowledge. So the rest of the book is spent trying to find out where the money came from and who is after it. Both answers are kind of \\"ho hum\\". After the run this author has had it is not surprising to see that the well is a bit low and I am most pleased that I was loaned this book by a friend. If you want to read it, I hope you have a friend like I do.	2002-03-14

John Lescroart's Dismas Hardy novels are among the most entertaining and well written of the lawyer-cop-mystery genre. The gang's all here in this story which does a number on the HMO industry and their ability or lack thereof to take proper care of the enrollees. The head of the HMO has been hit by a hit and run driver and brought, unfortunately for him, to the hospital which his HMO manages. While in the ICU, he succumbs to his injuries...or does he? ... An obvious suspect is being investigated, Dismas is representing him and it looks as though an arrest may be imminent. However, as the investigation proceeds, many stories within stories are discovered, not the least of which is that someone is murdering people in the ICU. This story, regretably never gets inside a courtroom, but the resolution and Dismas Hardy's involvement in it, nevertheless still makes this a compelling and interesting read.	2002-03-11

Stephen Cannell finally wrote a book that failed miserably in living up to our expectations of his story telling ability. The story is plodding and difficult to stay with, although I did finish it just to see if it would get better. Alas, no.<br />The central characters of Shane Scully and Alexa Hamilton fail to interest...the &quot;Vikings&quot; are an unbelieveable lot of misfits. The &quot;scheme&quot; that they are pursuing of making a killing, both literally and figuratively in the &quot;parallel market&quot; is hard to follow and equally difficult to believe.<br />The bodies are stacking up like cord wood as you work your way through the book, but you find yourself not caring that much and just waiting for the quite predictable ending.

I agree with the premise because it is happening to one of the papers I subscribe to. There are no reporters anymore. Papers take \\"reports\\" from all sorts of civic groups, rather than \\"reporting\\" on what they are doing and peddle the results as news.<br />Jack Tagger is this book's \\"champion.\\" Jack has done the unpardonable and told the new owner of the paper what he thinks of his company..his policies and his ethics. For that, Jack is demoted to writing obits.<br />And a good thing it is. Jimmy Stoma of Jimmy Stoma of the Slut Puppies has drowned while diving on a wreck in the Bahamas. Jimmys career has been up and down, but our hero knows all about that and takes an interest in the obit he is to write. Then it really gets interesting. The death looks suspicious, the autopsy never happened, his sister has real doubts and his editor...ahhh...his editor...well that's another story.<br />Carl Hiassan has writen a story that keeps your interest, educates you on what is happening to our countries newspapers and is, as always very entertaining. This is a softer Hiassan. He has put away his flourescent paints, yet he still makes his point in a way that is both entertaining and educational. Some who are waiting for the former governor of Florida to come out of the swamp again and right a number of environmental wrongs, may be disappointed. Those that like a good story well told, will not be. It is good to see a successful author reinvent himself, if even slightly.	2002-02-07

He is at the same level with this story of WW 2. Some may see the story as trying to curry favor with the feminists among us who believe they could be running everything if only we could reverse some historical pronouns. Actually, the ladies that attempted to sabotage the Nazi phone system in France, just before D Day had help from within their numbers by a male from within and without their numbers. This is really a well told story of the life of the times by an author who does his research and presents as compelling a story as he has ever written I could recount the outline of the story, but others here have done it well. My report is that Ken Follett is at the top of his game with this offering and that is well worth the purchase of this book. You will savor it!	2002-01-04

Because the story is about dogs, the human spirit and an amazing adventure, I started reading what it had to say. It was soon after that I decided that Mr. Follet's book could wait.<br />Several houurs after that, I am writng this review and suggesting, urging, imploring, anyone who has an appreciation of what is involved with staking it all in answering your life's dream to give yourselves a wonderful present and read this book.<br />You will learn a lot about what it takes to own and run a team of sled dogs, about what is involved in planning such an expedition and all of the pitfalls to be avoided...but more importantly, you will have your eyes opened to a corner of the human spirit that too many of us shy away from as being..too dangerous..too odd..too off the wall..which will make you assess what it is that is important in your life. We already know what is important with the author's life from reading the book. However, she did not write this book to encourage more sled dogging. The book is a beautiful metaphor about life and one's dreams and one's soul. This author found the key. So should we all. Do yourself a favor and buy a copy of this most wonderful adventure.<BR>-----------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Since writing the review that appears above, I have learned that the book was the recipient of a First Place award at the Benjamin Franklin Book Awards in the catagory TRAVEL ESSAY. It is well deserved and the book has goine into a second printing.	2001-12-31

This is a difficult book to classify as one can tell by the disparity of the reviews you can find here. One thing is for sure, there is no shortage of opinion. Whether or not you enjoy this book may well depend if one likes Patterson's style of very short chapters and not very much background on his characters. In this book, Patterson feels compelled at least twice to go back through each of Alex Cross's book appearances to try and tie one aspect of the mystery together, i.e. who is The Mastermind. Once would have been enough, believe me. <br />There are two mysteries in this book. The identity of the aforementioned Mastermind and the identity of the vampire slayers who have been killing people at an alarming rate and in a horrifying fashion.<br />Because of his writing style, one never really gets an understanding of the whole vampire issue and the interweaving of The Mastermind throughout is as much annoying as it is interesting.<br />It is an easy book to read, but at the end one feels like the effect that is often described to a Chinese dinner. All that food and you are hungry an hour later.	2001-12-30

I have not found the first two up to the standards the author now sets for himself, but I liked this book quite a lot. The wise cracking is eased off and Elvis gets himself involved in a situation that takes some doing to solve and it is done in a fairly believeable way. I hope that as the series progresses he continues to improve to the level of L.A. Requiem.<br />In this book Elvis has been hired by a big shot Hollywood producer to find his ex-wife and son as he thinks after 12 years it is time to be a Dad. Well, Mom and son have moved from LA to Chelam, Connecticutt. Mom has made a life for herself and son, Toby, without any help from the big shot and it is not wanted now.<br />However, Mom has this little problem of having been co-opted by the Mafia to do some money laundering (she is a branch bank manager) and while she would like to end the relationship, the Mafioso that has used her has other ideas.<br />Soon all of the characters are in the same vicinity and it takes all of Elvis's and Joe Pike's efforts to keep matters from dissolving into a large pool of blood. How they do it is the point of these easy reading novels and why we keep coming back for more.	2001-12-27

The premise of a sitting First Lady wanting to divorce her husbnand, the President is not so hard to accept. Many White House marriages have been badly flawed and it is only a matter of time before a spouse has really had enough. If Jay Brandon had dealt with just that scenario this might have been a better book. Instead he throws in a Satanized version of Bill Gates who has developed a computer chip that will do the most dastardly things and who has the President in the palm of his hand and sleeping with one of his confederates. The whole project is in danger of being exposed, however. Not by some super spy of industrial espionage, but by the President's 8 year old son who has learned of the plans (and understands them) while evesdropping during Oval Office visits. Myra, the First lady is obsessed with Randy and getting him out of the White House. The bad guy is obsessed with getting Randy and closing the loop on exposure of his plans. The President is obsessed with staying in office. All of this gets dumped in the lap of a Texas lawyer named David Owens who becomes obsessed with Helen, one of the Secret Service Agents protecting Myra and Randy. This then turns into a lot of cat and mouse running and hiding, power plays, threats and intrigues and a surprise ending which has been done several times before and is no surprise to the reader.<BR>It probably is a better movie script than a book but, readers who like intrigue among the powerful will still enjoy the book. I just thought it was a bit of a stretch.	2001-12-18

For some reason, the author felt compelled to have Carol Starkey sucking on a cigarette during most of her waking hours. Perhaps it was to demonstrate her fragile hold on reality after having been killed as a Bomb Squad member of the LAPD. She was clinically dead for a period of time and then revived. Her partner and lover was not so fortunate. Transferred from that position to the Criminal Conspiracy Section of the LAPD (Dective-2) she catches the lead in investigating the death of another Bomb Squad member. It appears that the bomb in the case she is investigating was made by a serial bomber known as Mr. Red who, while available as a killer for hire with his pyrotechnics, is apparently killing a bomb squad member or two, just for the fun of it. To tell more of the story line would give away some of the twists, turns and quirks of this very well told tale of revenge and betrayal. To do that would be to spoil the soup. Again, this book is evidence of the growth of this author from his early and popular Elvis Cole novels.	2001-12-07

Requiem, (the best Elvis Cole novel so far), Demolition Angel and Hostage. Because I read those later efforts first, I am having some problems with the earlier Elvis novels which are heavy on wise cracking by Cole, big into martial arts and thin in the story line. If you find yourself in an airport and you forgot to bring something to read in line and on the plane, these will do, but I don't recommend going back to these earlier efforts to find the level of writing Crais is putting out now. Most authors burst on the scene and over time find it harder and harder to maintain their edge. Not so here. These early novels are Creative Writing 101 products.	2001-12-01

The first one, Monkey in a Raincoat and this one, the most recent. For my money, there is little to compare them. I found his first effort to be pretty thin porridge, but enjoyable. This one is a real story. A true whodunit for much of the book with many interesting subplots and characters. A book you hated to put down and looked forward to being able to get back to it. There are characters you can learn to hate and characters you root for. While the first Elvis novel was heavy on trying to be funny, this one is high grade raw meat and as serious as a heart attack. Others have detailed the book's storyline. My message is that if you are looking for one of the best books written in this genre in a long time, give it the &quot;One Click&quot; and get ready for some interesting reading!	2001-11-25

Michael Griffith has written a book that I figure Richard Russo (Nobody's Fool, Straight Man and Empire Falls) would write if he chose to write a book with golf as the central activity of the main character. Brian Schwan is a former college star golfer whose star has failed to ascend to the PGA Tour, The Nike Tour or any other tour that you ever heard of. He is playing the Snapper/Gold Club Tour where &quot;there's not enough money to go around and only the pitiless and the unthinking survive.&quot;<br />We join our &quot;hero&quot; as he is carding a sloppy 76 in the opening round of what may be his last tournament while his playing partner has fired a &quot;Gieberger,&quot; For the unitiated that is a 59. Something that occurs so rarely in competition that it is referred to by the name of the first man to do it.<br />In the parking lot following the round, Schwan is asked for an interview by a female TV reporter who is easy on the eyes and who has mistaken him for his playing partner, &quot;Bird&quot; Soulsby who has shot the 59. Schwan pretends he is Soulsby and not only completes the interview, but manages to arrange a date with the reporter for dinner that evening.<br />The problem is that Schwan is married and as guilt and lust start to crowd into his mind we learn a tad more about his marriage, his life growing up and his parents than we really want to know. What takes place during the date is entertaining and it takes most of the book to go from that time to the next day when Bird and Brian tee it up again in the second round of the tournament.<br />As I said at the beginning, the approach to this book is more of the Richard Russo style of writing than your normal golf story and it really only uses golf as vehicle to weave the story. I found some of the psychological aspects of the books to be a bit drawn out, but it is entertaining enough for the most part. Not a ringing endorsement, but Mr. Griffith has promise.	2001-11-23

We don't think of Montana as being a haven for mobsters, pedophiles, neo-Nazis and others given to abherrant behavior, but Bitterroot Valley seems to have them in fair abundance. Also there to stir up the pot are an undercover ATF operative named Sue Lynn Big Medicine, an alcoholic mystery writer, his cokehead actress wife, and in the center, stirring the pot for all that it is worth are Tobin &quot;Doc&quot; Voss a pacifist - turned Navy SEAL - turned poet - turned physician and his friend Billy Bob Holland who has had quite a career as well (Houston cop, Texas Ranger, Phoenix US Attorney and now a private attorney from Deaf Smith, Texas).<br />Doc's daughter is raped and eventually Doc is charged with murdering one of the suspects. Billy Bob agrees to represent him. However, don't get ready for any court room scenes, because this plays out in a convulted fashion in which scores are settled and people get what they deserve.<br />Well crafted dialogue is a strength of the author, James Lee Burke, and he outdoes himself in this book. The discussions between Billy Bob and the local sherrif, J.T. Cain are something to look forward to.<br />This book will hook you as you try to figure out what is going to happen next and with all of the characters twisting through the book there is a lot happening. James Lee Burke has been awarded two Edgars in the past for hit literary efforts. I'm not sure this one will rise to that level, but is definitly worth your time.	2001-11-16

I read the three books that Flynn wrote after this one before I came back to it to see if it was as poor as the Kirkus reviewer says. I gave it 4 stars only because of the comparison to the three sequels. They are without peer as you will see if you read my reviews of them. This is a damn fine read. It will make those that think Madeline Albright was a great Secretary of State uncomfortable; it will make those that believe Bill Clinton had a clue about what he was doing for eight years squirm; it is a book that as Howard Cosell used to say, &quot;tells it like it is&quot;. It is not for everyone, but it spoke to me and if you are wearing a flag pin or flying one from your car these days, I guarantee it will speak to you. That's all we want a book to do.	2001-11-13

Robert Crais is not an author I had read before I obtained a copy of Hostage. My mission is now to read his other efforts for this was a compelling page turner.Jeff Talley, a former LAPD SWAT team hostage negotiator has left that position due to a hostage situation which haunts his life. He has taken the position of Chief of Police of a small California town where the big police issues have nothing to do with guns or danger. Unfortunately for Talley, three misfits of society are about to change all that. After a botched attempt to rob a convenience store during which the store employee was killed, their vehicles engine craps out, leaving them near an exclusive residential subdivision. Over the wall they go and into the house of Arthur Smith. Had they picked any other house in there, things might have been different, but Smith is an acountant for The Mob and his house holds their secrets and a few million dollars of dirty money. Unaware of all this, the trio entertains themselves by terrorizing Smith and his children until it becomes apparent that the police are looking for them. The first officer to suspect their location ends up paying for this discovery with his life as he is cut down in a hail of bullets from the house.<BR>Talley and his men set up a perimeter about the house as things start to get very complicated. The people whose records are in the house undertake action to send their own people, posing as FBI agents to the scene to recover the records. To neutralize Talley, his wife and daughter are kidnapped and are themselves hostages. Talley is contacted by their abductors and agrees to cooperate. Crais's plotting of this piece is materful and needs to be read to be appreciated. It is an absolute &quot;cannot put this down&quot; book.	2001-11-10

Vince Flynn just gets better and better.<br />I can't wait for the next book! To appreciate this book as much as posible it is best to have read Transfer of Power and The Third Choice which very nicely keep us up to date with the major characters in the story.<br />I have even gone back and bought Term Limits which was his first book. I don't know if it is essential to go there, but this effort has been criticized by some and I am enough of a fan of the author and an aspiring writer that I would like to see for myself how the first one went.<br />Enough of that. This book is so good that I realy just want to say that and hope it will be enough to interest you to buy it. Nah! All the good people and some of the bad from earlier books ae moving forward with their lives. Mitch Rapp, who is certainly a very important part of Transfer of Power only continues to grow in importance as the books unfold and in this book he is at his zentih. I continue to pray that we have a Mitch Rapp in the employ of the CIA. We all should, but I suspect that the last eight to ten years have cost us dearly in that regard.<br />Suffice it to say that Flynn lays out all of the trip wires that are there in this day and age and very deftly manuvers around them. If you are into red, white and blue these days, you will love this book. If you are one who has reservations about what we are doing in response to 9/11, you will find instruction in this novel. If you are sitting in Bagdahd, working on weapons of mass destruction, you will pray this is just a figment of the authors imagination. In any event, this book is so worth reading that I can not recommend it enough.	2001-10-30

Code named Ironman, it looks as though Rapp has ended his service to our country, when after taking out a German industrialist who was aiding Sadaam Hussein to build weapons of mass destruction, his partner in the hit, turns her gun on Rapp and fires two bullets into his chest at point blank range.<br />Through the miracle of Kevlar, Rapp survives (although few others do) and spends the rest of the book trying to figure out who wanted him dead and why. <br />Deftly written, Flynn makes his characters very believeable and the scenarios they encounter more than plausable. His use of dialogue, something I admire in any gifted writer, is excellent and you are drawn through the pages at a pace which does damage to your sleep time, but which leaves you looking forward to the knowledge that there is a sequel to this book, Separation of Power, waiting in your &quot;books to be read pile.&quot; I discovered the author Jan Karon, after she had written five of her books in the Mitford series and had the luxury of reading them seriatum. I am equally fortunate with Mr. Flynn and only hope that his imagination and his energy level remain high, so that he can keep drawing us through his world of danger, espionage and intrigue.	2001-10-26

If you are one of those who is singing &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; these days after September 11th or if you voted for Bill Clinton and Al Gore, this book will make you uncomfortable, at best and depressed, at worst.<br />This book is about how &quot;the adults&quot; deal with terrorisim, albeit on a much smaller scale than we are currently seeing. The White House has been successfully attacked and occupied by terrorists, led by Rafique Assiz. The president has managed to escape to a bunker in the White House which is believed to be impregnable, but he is out of contact with the outside world. That leaves the handling of the retaking of the White House and the rescuing of the hostages taken to the Vice President. His method of dealing with terorists to to capitulate to the first two demands (unfreeze Iraq's assets and have the UN drop all sanctions against Iraq) in order to save hostages and shore up his hopes to assume the presidency should the terrorists get their hands on the president. This possibility becomes more probable when it is discovered that the terrorists are close to drilling through the entry door to the president's bunker and brings into play the naked thirst for power that exists in those who live in Washington, DC. While the Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Director of the CIA and many others, plan ways to liberate the White House and eliminate the hostages, the Vice President and his corrupt Chief of Staff, plot and spin ways to survive politically without too much regard as to how they do it.<br />The &quot;good guys&quot; have managed to insert Mitch Rapp, a counter terrorisim specialist into the White House along with a man who knows all the hidden passageways. As Assiz's plan works it's way to fruition, events converge to give the reader a page turning experience. Based upon the quality of this book, I have bought the two sequels, The Third Option and Separation of Power and look forward to reading more about Mr. Flynn's vision of the world we now find ourselves in.	2001-10-23

He is without peer in describing courtroom action and the dialogue is spot on, both in it's literary quality and it's legal accuracy. This is an interesting mix of love and revenge which finds Attorney Joseph Atonelli right in the center of the whirlwind. It starts with the funeral of Judge Calvin Jefferies, one of the vilest human beings to ever ascend the bench. Fittingly enough the good judge has died in a way that brings some joy to those he has mistreated during his career - he has been murdered in a knife attack - and for good measure he is disembowled, or as Antonelli points out in a question to a witness - &quot;You mean he was gutted?&quot;<BR>The killer is arrested based on an anonymous tip that he would be found &quot;under the bridge&quot; where the homeless live. He confesses to the crime and a short while later he is found dead in his cell - an apparant suicide. Not long after that his successor is also murdered in a knife attack and another tip is recieved that the murderer can be found &quot;under the bridge&quot; in the homeless community. Sure enough, the police find a young homeless man with a knife that has the victim's blood on it. It is the defense of this accused person that provides Antonelli with the biggest challenge of his career and you will just have to get the book to see how this is woven into a plot which will keep you reading to the end and sorry when it is reached.	2001-10-18

One is tempted to think that Mr. Dorsey was an Al Gore supporter who has decided to take out his vitriol on the State of Florida with this book. In this tale, none of the characters, not one damn one, has any redeeming social value. Not even the &quot;hero&quot;, Governor Marlon Conrad. It is amuzing in many respects, but as a series of one liners and in some of the characters that it draws, not as a well woven tale. Some have said that in his early novels, Dorsey was simply copying the style of Carl Hiassen and a few others. No one will make that comparison again. <br />So if you are one of those who believes you lost your right to vote in the last Presidential election and that Al Gore &quot;waz robbed&quot;, you will probably enjoy this book. However, excessively heavy handed satire is not my cup of tea and unless it is yours, I suggest you take a pass on this one.	2001-10-11

You will probably not be looking to take a vacation trip to Columbia anytime soon after reading this as kidnapings of tourists seems to be a local sport among some of the locals. In this instance Nick Ray's father has been kidnapped while on a trip to Columbia to buy some additional fishing boats for his fleet. Not to worry, he has purchased kidnap insurance. 3,000,000 dollars worth, which just happens to be the amount of the ransom demand. ....  Strange things start to happen to Nick as he attempts to overturn their decision and doors that used to be open to him keep closing. The story moves between the kidnapped father and the searching son until they are finally brought together in an ending which keeps the reader rivited until the last page.	2001-10-09

This book, while it has an excellent premise and storyline, somehow doesn't bring the story off with the usual panache as their two previous efforts. The start is quick, but after they establish that things are seldom what they seem with two of their characters, the story, to my mind, bogs down terribly while the sister of one of the story's victims tries to sort things out and understand what is going on. Well, what is going on is the evolution of mind control experiments which began back in the 50's and with the help of some experts in the field she is able to recover the identity of one of the principals in the story. The mystery being solved, the rest of the book is dedicated to getting revenge for the damage that has been caused and the pace of the action picks up considerably. It's not a bad book, but it seems to have sufferred, in this instance, from over writing. I will hope for a better result the next time these two collaberate.	2001-09-28

So wrote Mark Twain many years ago and Jack Dunphy, the main character in this book, becomes a believer very quickly. Jim Hougan is half of the husband and wife team which writes under the pen name, John Case, and as such they have written two very good books and one which I have recently reviewed, which is not up to their earlier standards. However, on his own in this effort, Hougan more than carries the day. It is a fast paced mystery-thriller which leaves you wondering how much that is revealed therein, may be more fact than fiction. It will leave you satisfied that you have been told an interesting yarn, however as you scan the newspaper you may see stories that will make you wonder if all that is as it seems.

In the title for this review I indicate this book is one of the best and I don't mean as a book about golf, although it is certainly that. This is about so much more. It's about life, meeting challanges, dealing with adversity, and personal relationships, all wrapped up in a very interesting story about a professional golfer who after being blinded in a freak accident, finds that, with the help of others, especially his long suffering caddie, that he can again play the game and contend on the PGA Tour. How all of that happens is, of course, what the book is all about. It is funny, charming, inspiring and best of all, a wonderful story. Whether you play golf or not, you will find yourself captivated by this book.	2001-09-24

As some have noted, Dead Solid Perfect was a dead solid hit among golfers and has been the standard by which other golf novels are judged. Unfortunately, the author who created the standard has failed to measure up to it. The story is mildly entertaining, but just not up to what we have come to expect from this writer. Having recently read The Green and A Mulligan for Bobby Jobe, I am aware of how good a novel can be woven about this enchanitng and maddening game. This isn't one of them.	2001-09-15

Philip Margolin is one of my favorite writers, but he must have been fulfilling a contract with a time requirement on this one. The plot is interesting though overly convoluted and the characters are basically one dimensional. We have the non-ivy league associate in a major big city law firm, the attractive former cop/investigator for the firm who first befriends and then falls for our &quot;hero&quot;, the highly succesful plainiff's lawyer who has filed suit against a pharmacutical company represented by the firm, a venal top litigator for the firm who sets out to make our hero's life a living hell for failing to spot a damaging document during a review of their response to a document request, we have the hero's best male friend in the law firm who never loses faith in him, we have the good cop/bad cop investigating team for the local police force and we have a whole other story within a story that takes place earlier in time and which provides an improbable link the the main tale. You do keep turning the pages because the writing is straight forward and you kind of wonder who all of the bad guys are. With several chapters to go you have it figured out and the book finally just ends. That was the best part.	2001-09-09

I have read every book he has written. The early books, starting with The Flight of the Old Dog were first rate and very believeable. As time has passed, the technology involved in his tales has started to stetch one's ability to believe, but one gets the impression that he really knows what he is talking about and he doesn't bore you to death with technocrat explanations.<BR>In this book, the US has elected an isolationist President who is not a member of either major political party. The character is interesting, but he never could have been elected holding the beliefs that he does, so we have to fudge our way past that and just declare him elected. Once that is accomplished he skips his Innauguration, gets sworn in privately at Blair House and walks across the street to the White House and goes to work. He also decides not to do a State of the Union speech, which isn't a bad idea. When you think of it, maybe he could get elected after all.<BR>In any event, the new president starts withdrawing US forces around the globe which leads to predictable instability in the geopolitical situation. Into the chaos walks Pavel Kazakov, a Russian gangster with a desire to build an oil pipeline to the Baltic, millions of dollars at his disposal and his very own stealth-bomber which was left over from the breakup of the USSR. He sets about to wreak havoc in the Balkans and to take advantage of the void in NATO's ability to respond to get the oil flowing to the Black Sea and millions of dollars a day flowing into his bank accounts.<BR>Standing in the way of his plans are Patrick McClanahan and his usual support staff from Dreamland and Skymasters along with some very brave Turkish and Ukranian pilots. I thought the action was first rate and you really look forward to the final confrontation as the bad guys are about to get theirs. For no matter how difficult the assignment, or how many obstacles are thrown in the path of our heroes, you can take it to the bank that the bad guys will get theirs. How they do it if most of the fun.	2001-09-06

Bill Lane is saving the world again (literally) and he is doing it in a page turning fashion. Many villians, numerous pitfalls, snares and delusions await Mr. Lane and his people as they pursue a former East German Stasi leader Helmut Speyer and his wife, Gloria Swanson (I'm not kidding) who have plans to make a &quot;killing&quot; (figuratively and literally) and then retire in opulent splendor to Cuba (Eden's Gate).

I am a pilot, a lawyer and I have an interest in politics and current events. So naturally I am going to give five stars to a book that deals with all four, right? Not so fast, Pilgrim. <br />Mr. Nance has earned his rating with this novel which details the efforts of the President of Peru to arrest and extradite a former United States President under the Treaty Against Torture (the same treaty that Chilean ex-President Pinochet recently dealt with). The story takes us from Greece to Sicily to London to Belfast and to Galway as well as from Laramie, Wyoming to Denver, Colorado on a ride in a Cessna Skyhawk that none of us would want to have been on. The international flying is an odyssey of the finest kind as the captain of the German commercial airline's 737, a US Air Force Reserve Officer, tries to keep his former Commander in Chief from being arrested much to the chagrin of his British First Officer who sees their jobs evaporating with each new escapade.<br />Add to the excellent flying portion of the story, a chess game on the ground between two international lawyers with very different backgrounds and the story only gets better.The Peruvian government has hired a British Barrister who is tops in his field. The American ex-president hires a former partner, who while once a very able international lawyer, has had a bit of a time of it lately, having been disbarred as a Judge and suspended as a lawyer and is waiting out his suspension teaching classes at the University of Wyoming when the call comes.<br />The Peruvian government seems to have irrefutable evidence of the crimes of the former president and therein lies more twists and turns in this most compelling novel.<br />The characters are well drawn, the dialogue flows smoothly and the story moves seamlessly across the pages of the book until, alas, you are at the end. Looking for a page turner? Look no further.	2001-08-21

We learn more about Tomlinson also, the self absorbed mystic who spends most of the book trying to put lead in his pencil in several humorous situations. I used to think that Carl Hiaasen was the king of this type of Florida novel. I now suspect we may have a new claimant to the throne. This book has action, intrigue, sex, information about the ecology of Florida and numerous other entertaining aspects that will make you glad you picked up this book. If this is your first experience with RWW and Doc Ford, I predict it will not be your last.	2001-08-19

Somehow this particular story kind of mills around without much energy and has some trouble keeping the reader's interest. No one ever represented anyone charged with murder that was clearly more guilty, so you know he is innocent. After that you wait for the onion to get peeled down to the answer. There is not enough courtroom action here and one learns a bit more about genetics than we really want to. This isn't a bad book. Just not up to his usual standard...which is wha the verdict from &quot;this jury of one&quot; at least is three stars.	2001-08-18

Unfortunately, just like no one &quot;owns&quot; a golf game, Troon McAllister demonstrates that no one &quot;owns&quot; the formula to writing a successful sequel. The story starts out promisingly enough as you learn some of the foibles and fables of those that make up this particular foresome who are about to take their annual golfing vacation. This year they are off to Swithen Bairn, the most exclusive golf resort in the world where if you don't think you have had the vacation of a lifetime, you don't pay. The cost for the week is on the order of $18,000, so the promotional come on is not given lightly. As the intrepid four begin their vacation they are drawn into a match with &quot;the owners&quot;, one of whom is Eddie Camminetti of recent Ryder Cup fame from &quot;The Green&quot;. As the week plays out the struggle between The Foursome against The Owners and with each other takes some twists and turns that are less than pleasant until you feel you are trapped in some horrendous Twi-Light Zone and that all is missing is the soothing voice of Rod Serling. What was fun and funny turns ugly and mean and the story, to my thinking rather loses its way until it is tied up at the end with an Epilogue that is not worthy of the author. The story had possibilities, but they got lost somewhere on the back nine of the second match and never recovered.	2001-08-06

He is the author of this mess and all I can say that from the cover itself, the reader is fairly warned. Christopher Buckley, who may be singularly responsible for the early success of this book by writing the feature review for the NY Times Book Review a few weeks ago, must have been suffering from some bad gin when he favorably reviewed this. Then perhaps, I am not avant guarde enough to appreciate it, but I found it a monumental waste of time and money.

I had thought Dan Jenkin's book, Dead Solid Perfect, was probably the most realistic and believeable novel about the professional game. That was until I read Troon McAllister's book,The Green. Even non-golfers would probably enjoy it as it is about more than golf. Great characters in believeable situations all handled superbly by the author. Eddie Caminetti is much more than a golf hustler with the game of a tour veteran. He has a mind like a steel trap and the nerves of a tight rope walker. How he becomes a Captain's pick for the US Ryder Cup team and how he handles the assignment are a treat. There is much to learn from this immensely entertaining book...about golf...it's rules...human nature and life itself. You will not want to put this book down. It is that good!!	2001-07-29

Dismas Hardy is not going to get drawn into representing the accused killer of Elaine Wager (Cole Burgess). Well, only because his sister asks, he will make sure that the man who was found standing over the dead body of Ms. Wagner with the murder weapon in his hand and her jewelry in his pockets, gets proper tratment in the lockup as he deals with his drug addiction. But that's all.<br />As he looks into the matter he discovers his good friend, Police Lt. Abe Glitsky taking unusually questionable contitutional liberties with Mr. Burgess's interrogation and incarceration. Then the San Francisco District Attorney, Sharon Pratt, who's administration has been known for it's inability to get convictions (all the good prosecutors resigned) and it's &quot;humane&quot; treatment of criminals it considers to be victims of society decides to ask for the death penalty. Of course, it is an election year and Ms. Pratt's re-election chances are tenuous at best.<br />We learn early on that the murder victim is in fact, Abe Glitsky's daughter (her mother married another man while pregant by Glitsky). The helps explain his uncharacteristic behavior.<br />After viewing a &quot;confession&quot; that the police sweat out of Cole, Glitsky starts to wonder if they have the real killer and from that concern, the story unwinds toward &quot;The Hearing&quot;. Hardy signs on for the duration and picks up considerable help along the way.  Lescroart is at his best during the trial scenes and the reader somewhat impatiently waits for the story to unravel, which it surely does in a most satisfying way when court is in session. Lecroart has never failed to please his readers.	2001-07-15

It is a novella at best and as that, it is not that bad. The type setting and such stretched this out a bit in size, but if it had been printed as a real book it would have been thin indeed. The writing is just ok...those of us who have loved the Mitford Series have been waiting so long for this litle window on their world that we lapped it up without too much complaint until we realized we had been had. We loved to have our characters back and we laughed and cried at the few things of interest that occur, but at &quot;the end of the day&quot; as people like to say these days, we are left with the thought that Jan Karon is out of ideas with the people that made the Mitford series great. This should have been in the fourth book and would have taken two chapters. To publish it as a long awaited 6th book at full book prices is an insult to her readers. I hope we will look at the 7th book that she is obligated to by contract with a lot more caution. Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.	2001-06-28

The review of this book in the New York Times Book Review Section said so and this is one of the few times I agree with &quot;the paper of record.&quot; (My wife buys it - I don't)<br />Having read Nobody's Fool and Straight Man, I had high expectations for this book to begin with. Add to that, it is set in the State of Maine, as am I. I know the town of Empire Falls. It is a microcosim of many Maine mill and factory towns. And I know some of the people Russo has brought to life to tell his story. What is most interesting to me is that he had the insight and ability to weave such an entertaining book out of the situation he describes.<br />Miles Roby is the central character of this book. Miles has dreams. To move to Martha's Vinyard and run a business there instead of the diner he is running (but not owning) in Empire Falls. To get Charlene Gardiner into bed which is something he has been lusting to do since he was a teen and she was the four year older beauty of Empire Falls. She now works for him as a waitress and knows what he wants, but tells him he would be disappointed. And on it goes with wonderful characters populating Empire Falls, all doing their best to frustrate Miles's plans and schemes. Woven throughout the book is an explanation of the past; his relationship with his mother who has died and his father who refuses to; the hold that Francine Whiting has on his life as the town's richest citizen and control freak; and on it goes until at the end a resolution is reached which surely does not contain great surprise, but resolves things in a believeable and real fashion. That is Russo's strength. He writes about real people; puts the most wonderful dialogue in their mouths and just entertains you from beginning to end with his story telling. If he is not on your list of authors to read, he should be. If he already is and you don't have this book - what are you waiting for?	2001-06-28

I enjoy this author and I particularly liked The Ax which was a real departure from his Dortmunder series, which I also like. (the review is in here somewhere if you care). The Hook was a huge disappointment. Not only is the story unbelieveable, the ending is the kind that leaves you saying..&quot;Huh?&quot; The central character is a popular author who is &quot;blocked&quot; due to the fact he is locked in a miserable divorce with his 2nd wife and during this he has a chance meeting in the library with an old friend, another writer who is far down the list of successful authors. During that conversation a plan is hatched to rid the character of his problem by having the friend murder his wife. Up to that point the story has promise, but thereafter it reads like the plot outlines that Bryce, the &quot;blocked author&quot; has written that his own agent can't even swallow. Too bad. The story line could be much improved, but the author chose to pull the plug on the yarn and I suggest that you save your money...even at paperback prices.	2001-06-08

When you couple that with the ingenious way that the person who takes that name as his cyberspace &quot;handle&quot; has developed a program that enables him to kill perfect strangers in order to win a &quot;game&quot; played among hackers, your discomfort rachets itself up to a sense of forboding. &quot;Could someone really do this?&quot;<br />Jeffery Deaver, in what may be his best work to date, invites the reader into what would be any computer crime investigator's worst nightmare and he does it with such alacrity and believeablity that you may never look at your computer the same way again.<br />As usual, Deaver has come up with a wealth of characters. Some of them you fear for. Others you hate. Some you pity. As the CCU, (Computer Crimes Unit) tries to stop Phate from killing again, they learn that he has an accomplice that remains a mystery until the very end of the story. I defy anyone to figure it out until it is revealed. Phate's nemesis and alter-ego is recruited from prison by the police to assist them in their hunt, which sets off various entertaining sub-plots concerning the life and future of Wyatt Gillette. <br />If you like to be pulled through a story by its very momentum and realistic telling, this book is for you. Mr. Deaver has written nothing but compelling thrillers and he shows no evidence of losing his touch.	2001-06-03

I started this novel on an airline flight...which either shows my confidence in the industry or the fact that I love stories about planes and such. This book has been on my &quot;books to read table&quot; for some time and for reasons I am unable to fathom it took me a few years to get to it. The story starts with a horrendous airline disaster which occurs on take off as the #3 engine of the plane in question destroys itself and everyone on the flight. From that simple premise the author takes us through the investigation of such a tragedy, but it is the investigation and the manner in which it is being conducted which is quickly the focus of the piece. The NTSB investigation is flawed..not by incompetance but by corruption. The uncovering of the corruption by an investigative reporter is the peeling of the onion which exposes shortcomings in all of the professions it explores. The book which I read is the paper back version and it is a bit longer than necessary, but it is nevertheless an entertaining and informative read which is about all we ever look for in a novel these days. The book is apparently out of print at the moment, but the effort by the author deserves a review ....	2001-05-16

Danial Silva did this kind of novel well - a World War II piece where we know the outcome from reading history, but not how it came about...the nitty gritty...the dirty little secrets. Christopher Reich takes it to the same level with this effort. By the time the central character in the book, Devlin Judge, gets to page 298, a question has occurred to him...and to most readers, I suspect...&quot;Why were members of the American military assisting a fugitive SS officer and a scion of Germany's most powerful industrial family to carry out a heinous scheme whose success would ensure only personal heartbreak, national mourning and political instability?&quot; The answer takes many more pages and involves a very plausable conclusion. This book is a departure from the previous notable first effort by the author, Numbered Account, but it stands on its own as a first class piece of writing which I recommend without hesitation.	2001-05-03

I enjoyed this one the least. Perhaps it is because he is in to writing novels which have sequels. It has gotten to the point that in this one, when he refers to a characters past deeds that he puts a footnotnote to tell you where to go to find out about the history in a prior book. Here the story is labored and contrived to weave a web of interest about oil discovery in Cuba and behind the scenes attempts to over throw the Cuban government. Clearly a new fighter pilot is on the way for further novels (Eric) and I will probably buy the next effort, hoping that the magic of prior years will return. This novel is not worth the price.	2001-04-22

As the characters worked their way through the puzzle of how somebody was defrauding McLaren Life and Casualty out of millions of dollars the intrigue gets more complex, interesting and very dangerous. However, the answer to the puzzle struck me as so implausable that after following what had become a real head scratching story, I could not help but wonder why the author had chosen to go there.

When I first saw that the story involved the art works taken by the Third Reich, I was less than enthused as it sounded like a story that would be hard to make current or interesting. That's why Paul Lindsay writes novels and I only dream of doing so. Welcome to the world of great art and all of the nuances that it holds and also to the mind set of those that were responsible for the evils and excesses of the Third Reich. Taz Fallon, an FBI agent who is drawn into the search for the Hitler treasure finds himself willing to bend some rules in order to help Sivia Roth, an art historian who is amazingly easy on the eyes. During their efforts to discover the location of the stolen paintings they are competing with a villian by the name of Kurt Decker (son of &quot;Hitler's commando) who has been hired by the Neo-Natzi establishment to recover the fortune and fund their return to power. The plot has many twists and turns and their are times when you believe all has been revealed, only to find that there is more. Lindsay clearly knows his subject and he tells the tale in a book that is difficult to put down.	2001-03-28

Perhaps it is because of the subject matter, i.e. Middle East peace or the lack thereof. There are wheels within wheels on both sides of the issue and to explain that to a reader in a manner which still holds one's attention, probably explains the somewhat less than frantic pace of the action in this book. There are facinating insights into the working of the mind of Yassir Arafat and there is some interesting philosophy shared among the Israeli participants as well. I actually turned down the corner on page 75 where Ari Shamron, an Israeli spymaster tells Gabriel Allon, the assasin he has brought back into service, &quot;All right, if you want my opinion, I believe we will be no more secure after a peace deal than before it. If you want my opinion, I believe the fire in the Palestinian heart will never be extinguished until the Jews are driven into the sea....I would much rather do battle with a sworn enemy than with an enemy who finds expediency in posing as a friend.&quot; I happen to believe there is more truth in those words than in all of the posturing that came out of the Clinton peace process which ended with one of the participants being voted out of office. So with patience and clear character development, Silva weaves us through the passions and terror of the Middle East which spreads its effect throughout the globe. You will learn from reading this book and you will be well entertained. Not a bad combination!	2001-03-17

At least the price was right. Brad Metzler has a slam bang start to his book which is encouraging to the reader in the hope that the rest of the book will live up to it. Unfortunately, the opening is the best part. The main character, Michael Garrick, an attorney working in the office of Counsel to the President is conflicted in about every relationship he has....with his father, his office mates, a particular FBI agent, a drug dealer and most importantly the daughter of the President. After a night out with the First Daughter, during which they discover the Counsel to the President entering a gay bar and then leaving to make a drop of $40,000 in a wooded area of DC in the wee hours of the morning, Michael's world starts to crumble as he tries to figure out who is blackmailing whom and ends up being the chief suspect. Powerful forces are conspiring against him and he remains clueless as to their identity, although not for lack of effort. Metzler has not figured out the motivation for his main characters as they ricochet off each other as the fast paced writing drops clever little gossipy stories about life inside the White House. Jack Quinn is one of those Metzler thanks for background information (yes - THAT Jack Quinn) so if he was drawing on the last eight years as a basis for his story, it becomes obvious why the story is so confused. Dialogue, which can be what makes or breaks a story, all has the same voice to it. The ending is totally unbelieveable. Few loose ends are tied up and little satisfaction comes from having the culpurt revealed. The good news is that it doesn't appear there will be a sequel.	2001-03-17

A trash talking 15 year old has been dumped in his lap by a high priced hooker &quot;for a month&quot;...he has just shot and killed his former partner to prevent him from beating his wife to death (she is also Shane's former girlfriend)...and in spite of the fact that the partner shot at Shane first, the LAPD is out to make an example of him and Internal Affairs is set to perform an Administrative Review which, as the story unfolds, does not portend a happy ending for Sgt. Scully. Everyone from the mayor on down is upset by the shooting for reasons that Shane cannot understand, until he slowly starts to peel away layers of disinformation to get to the truth. When a character scoffs at him, &quot;You're being paranoid&quot;..Shane corrects her...&quot;I'm being framed.&quot; And is he ever on the money with that observation.<br />Stephen Cannell has written another page turner that will hold your interest to the end. The use of the character of the troubled teenager he is babysitting gets a bit warm and fuzzy, but the story and the unraveling of the mystery are worth the read.	2001-02-23

Mr. Reich, through his main character of Nicholas Neumann, has woven a very interesting web of mystery and intrigue. The villians are plentiful and at times it is difficult to tell who all of them are, which is part of the reason that the book keeps you up later than you planned on. The mind boggles at the amount of money that can be moved through this process and the manner in which this is done is explained so that even I could understand it. Paul Erdman has made a lot of money with books that explore the world of high finance and Swiss banking. He no longer has that genre to himself however, as Christopher Reich has proven in his first novel that he is a talent to be reckoned with.	2001-02-16

His first novel is written in a very compelling fashion. The story keeps moving in a very believable way and although the reader pretty much assumes that things are going to work out, you do keep wondering how that will happen. Getting there is a real treat, so if you are looking for a page turner, look no further. Let's hope Samuel's next effort will measure up to this very fine debut.	2001-02-08

This book is slightly off the caliber of the previous efforts, but not enough to cause one to change their reading habits. The character of Osama bin Laden is well drawn and the insights one gets into the psyche of one of the world's great terrorists is compelling. Kirk McGarvey is still dealing with those in our own government who wish him no particular well, but there is always Otto Rencke, McGarvey's secret weapon, who manages, barely, to keep our hero on mission. I thought the story was fascinating and plausable until the action at the end when McGarvey attempts to stop the terrorists from setting off a small neuclear weapon at a very inoportune time and place for the President of the United States and his daughter, Elizabeth McGarvey and several thousand others. I will leave each reader to make his or her own judgement on that. One thing is for sure...as we learn in the last words of the book...there WILL be a sequel....and I will look forward to it.	2001-02-06

It is that Stuart Woods will someday soon find in himself, the writer he once was at the beginning of his career. L.A. Dead is an improbable story at best and an absurd one at worst. Stone Barrington is about to marry a Mafioso princess in Venice and by Cardinal Bellini himself when Arrington Carter's husband, Vance Calder is the recipient of a bullet to the brain. Leaving his bride after the civil service, but before the Cardinal says the &quot;I do's&quot;, Stone rushes to Arrington's side to provide whatever assistance he can. It seems that there was no one else in the house when Vance was shot, other than Arrington, but she has amnesia and is in shock. The police are not amused. Stone is thinking that there may be an Arrington Barrington in his future after all if he can keep her clear of a conviction. His Mafia princess has a dim view of his change of heart, but inexplicably, her daddy, thinks none the less of old Stone for leaving his little girl at the alter. For the rest of the book, women in various stages of undress seem to populate Stone's life and bed. At the end one is left with the certain knowledge that Mr. Woods has left the door open for another sequel, assuming Stone does not get AIDS from all of his sexual indiscretion. However, I'm not sure any of us care that much anymore.	2001-01-29

I've been reading Janet Evanovich's books backwards (from Six to Four - so far) and it seems to work just fine. I prefer hardcover books and I found this one on the discount table so I was able to indulge two of my desires at the same time for less than paperback, i.e., a hardcover book and a Stephanie Plum story. All the characters are certifiable, everyone seems to be toting a gun of some kind and description and the pages just keep turning until you hit the end. These books are pure pleasure and should be approached as such. I will keep looking for One Two and Three in the used book stores. So should you if you haven't had the pleasure as yet.	2001-01-16

Although this book is out of print, I have had it on my to read table and I picked it up a few days ago and found it hard to put down. The story involves time travel, but unlike Michael Crichton's latest which deals with the same subject, Runyan doesn't clutter up the story with a detailed explanation about how one accomplishes such a feat. A well done plot, good characters and a fast pace make this a very enjoyable read. The fly leaf says Runyan is working on another novel. I will look forward to it.	2001-01-05

At times it was very good, well paced, clear characters and action and then it would wander of on some side road for a period of time. Given that the Detroit detective's name is featured on the cover, I kept wondering when he would appear. Well, not for quite a while and then the most interesting aspect of his life is his living arrangement with his ladlady.  I believe this needed more re-writing than it got.	2000-12-05

It refers to the myriad of characters and escapades that Tom Corcoran has cooked up for his character, crime photographer, Alex Rutledge and the fact that there are so many writers who want to be Carl Hiassan. Corcoran is the Key West version and while I found the story generally entertaining, it also got confusing at times as the plot twisted here and there, sometimes without apparent purpose. He does get into the mood and sprit of the Keys and there is some Buffet-like wisdom dispenced on occaision, but by the time that the reason why people are dying, getting beaten or disappearing becomes evident, you kind of wonder if it had to be that complicated. I liked the effort and should probably read his first book which seems to have general approval. Another writer about Florida who probably helps explain, without intending to, why they have so much trouble voting correctly down there.	2000-12-05

Score one for the environment and for readers who enjoy a novel with this theme.Quirky characters, interesting plots and situations and a good sense of humor weave a story with high entertainment value. I thought the author put more Hawaiian lore into the book than was necessary for the story and at times, I confess I found myself doing the &quot;Tom Clancy thing&quot;, i.e. scanning past lengthy displays of the authors knowledge about something which does little or nothing to advance the plot. It is an enjoyable read, however, and I suspect that those that characters who survived the book alive shall be seen again in a subsequent novel. I shall look forward to it.	2000-11-24

This was my first experience with Spencer. I found it less than satisfying. Perhaps it is because I have read a bit too much of him lately that I didn't appreciate the constant wise-cracking on the way to trying to solve the crime. Perhaps it was because everything seems to come so easily to Spencer, no matter how out-gunned or out manned. You never believe he is in any danger and in point of fact, he is not. Hired by a wealthy Georgian to find out who is shooting his race horses (without any real explanation as to how that would come about given the geography involved) Spencer finds the Yankee conception of a wealthy Southern family...totally dysfunctional, sexually aberrant and heavily into alcohol and adultery. After Daddy gets shot and killed, Spencer is taken off the case by the Managing Daughter, only to be hired back on by the deceased's current paramour who has an interesting little 22 year old secret of her own. Spencer returns to Georgia and proceeds to do his thing in running down the killer. The ending is totally unsatisfying - abrupt - little explanation and questions left hanging. Seemed like Parker needed to get the manuscript in the mail quickly. I think I shall give this writer a rest and I hope it will do us both good.	2000-11-17

It has seemed like a long time since Phillip Margolin wrote his last novel and when you like this writer as much as I do, two years IS a long time. But,the wait has been worth it. Others here have detailed the nuance of the story and the characters therein and they have done it quite well. If you like fast paced action, if you like a good mystery, if you like grown up writing, if you are looking for a real page turner, look no further. This one is for you. <br />And,if it is another two years before we hear from this author again, I won't complain. He clearly waits until he has something he can be proud to put his name on, unlike some of the other prolific and popular writers we have seen of late.	2000-11-07

On the strength of that novel,I ordered and read all of the remaining Perry novels, all of which deal with Jane Whitefield.<br />This one was the most complicated and presented by far the biggest challange to her talents and abilities. I decided to give it four stars, only because I felt that this novel caused me to suspend belief just a few too many times. Having Jane get married a book or so earlier, Mr. Perry also deals hardly at all, with the ease that Jane leaves her husband to go about the very dangerous business of making people disappear. <br />In this book, she takes on an additional burden. One of her charges, &quot;Bernie the Elephant&quot; knows where all of the Mafia's ill gotten gains are and a scheme is devised to make all of that money disappear as well. I give credit to the way that this is to happen, but it is really hard to believe that when all of the Mafia familes in the United States are looking for you and even have a rather accurate picture of what you look like, that a woman, an elderly man and a teenager are going to be able to elude these forces and remain safe while they travel about the United States and impoverish the Mafia. I also have some trouble with Jane's never ending source of money to buy cars, houses, clothing, etc. for herself and for those she is helping. How she came by that wealth is never really adressed in any of Mr. Perry's books. Having said all that, I really enjoyed the book. Its quite a tale and worth your time to read it.	2000-11-07

It clearly is my loss if this book which introduces the character Sunny Randall, PI is any judge of things. I picked up the book while on vacation - literally. It was left in our room for future guests to enjoy and it may be as perfect a &quot;beach read&quot; as I have seen in some time. If you don't break for lunch (or maybe even if you do)you will finish the 322 pages of this book before dinner. You will enjoy the reparte between the characters, you will wonder why Meredith Patton, age 15, is so determined to run away from a home that would seem to offer wealth and security, you will fall in love with a dog named Rosie and you will quickly figure out that you should not underestimate or mess with Ms. Sunny Randall. I shall have to try out some of the Spencer novels to see if they are as enjoyable. I am very optimistic.	2000-11-04

It is just plain stupid&quot;. <br />After all that &quot;Hitch&quot; has been through to get to that point, you have to give him high marks for paying attention. You also have to give Tim Cockney high marks for such an entertaining first novel. It has memorable, hilarious and hateful characters. It has funny, tense and always well scripted moments.<br />And it also has a mystery. Who killed the blackmailing tennis pro. And who is still blackmailing a US Senate candidate. As we read toward the answer to that conclusion we spend time at The Screaming Oyster Saloon, Sewall &amp; Sons Family Funeral Home, Heayhague, Maine (pronounced Hee Haw),The Moose Run Inn and various and sundry locations around Baltimore, including the police station.<br />The characters are priceless.

The author was recommended to me by an Episcopal priest and his wife, which if nothing else, should give the lie to the popular perception of Episcopalians. You won't find Dave Robichaud or his rough and ready side-kick, Clete Purcel, thumbing through The Book of Common Prayer, but in their own way, they surely are doing the Lord's work.<br />The many who have reviewed this book before me have outlined the plot very well, and an interesting and compelling story it is. However, the things which make me enjoy a book as much as I did this one, were the beautifully drawn characters, the mastery of the dialogue (you can truly hear each person speaking in their own voice) and the respect that the writer has for his readership. That Mr. Burke owns two Edgars is understandable. That he will own more in the future is certain.	2000-09-26

Hannah Keller is a big step up for the author. Thorne of  his early books is kind of a caricature of the Florida guy who finds  himself in interesting messes and gets through them. Hannah Keller is  definately not Thorne. Of course there is a guy named Hal whom you can grow  to be terrified of. There is our FBI trying to catch Hal, which I fervently  hope bears no resemblance to the FBI in this novel. There is the US Senator  who is somehow controlling the FBI's hunt for Hal to avenge his daughter's  murder. There is the bumbling, but honest FBI agent who is on a career  ending mission. There is Misty - whom you will not ask any one to sing  Misty For Me for you. This is a delicious soup..one that works through the  whole book. James W. Hall is growing as an author and that is always a fun  thing to watch and experience as a reader. Hop on and hang on - its a bumpy  ride.	2000-08-25

Whatever Carl Hiaasen is drinking, Tim Dorey has stolen the receipe and  improved it. Perhaps he let's the cat out of the bag before the story even  starts as to his motivation by using a quote from Mark Twain: &quot;Let us  consider that we are all partialy insane. It will explain us to each  other.&quot; It certainly explains the wild and crazy characters in this  book. They have been more than adequately detailed in the other reviews  here, but suffice it to say you are not likely to run into them in your  local Grand Union or Safeway store. However, if you are looking for a  chance to give your brain a rest and your funny bone a work out, the trip  through this book is well worth taking. I love these nutty books that are  about Florida. It's probably why we have a winter home in Arizona.	2000-08-11

Randy Wayne White is an authentic character. I suspected as much from reading his fiction efforts, usually involving Doc Ford. But in this collection of essays about his travels, you can see that he does not  subscribe to Travel &amp; Leisure or Conde Nast Traveler. He picks the  damndest places to go, the damndest things to do when he gets there and  writes about his experiences in a completely entertaining and very  informative fashion. These are not your traditional outings and Mr. White  would have it no other way. Hunting crocs with some authentic, although  somewhat legal poachers, chasing pigs through cathedrals, exploring the  seldom traveled parts of Australia, or fishing for fresh water sharks in  Nicaragua (legend has it they exist), he is seldom far from disaster and  you perversely kind of wish you were there..but not totally.

I am &quot;into planes&quot; as joegstein mentions, but I didn't find the fighter plane information was what cost this book two more  stars. It seemed to me that the author couldn't figure out who he wanted to  make the central character of the book as the story wandered back and forth  between the aircraft carrier, George Washington and the CIA in Langley, VA.  He also couldn't seem to decide exactly who the good and bad guys were and  kept positing alternate theories through his characters. I suppose the  ending of the story attempts to settle that question, but it does so in a  fairly casual and undramatic fashion. I enjoyed the read until I got to the  end and wondered why he chose to stop there. There were things left to be  sorted out and to the extent he tried, I was disappointed. As I said at the  outset, this was almost a really good book. Huston can write. He just  needed to give this one a bit more thought.	2000-07-01

My wife and I were in Bermuda in late May into June this year, a place we have traveled to for decades. We found ourselves in Hamilton one day and in the window of The Bermuda Bookstore  was a window full of this book with the information that the author would  be there for a signing in a few days. We are members of Coral Beach and  Tennis Club on the island and the name of the author rang a distant bell.  On checking the house list on our return that day, we discovered that Anne  Newton Walther was indeed among us. We soon discovered that good friends of  hers were there also. Eric and Debbie Pennison, who are among the people to  whom whe dedicates this book gave her a very lovely party to which they  invited the entire club membership and as a result of that we came away  with one of the books. I have now completed reading the book. I have found  it informative as to the era it depicts which is the time of the American  Revolution and the effect it had on this tiny outpost of Great Britain. She  has chosen as her vehicle to tell the story a young Frenchwoman who is  essentially a French spy who is won over to the American cause. In all  honesty, the story moves predictably and I found it most interesting from  the history of what was happening on Bermuda and the history of the island.  I have read and enjoyed historical novels, and I do not envy the author's  first foray into this type of genre. She does it creditably and holds ones  interest. It is not a &quot;page turner&quot; nor do I believe she intended  it to be. This is a first novel for Ms. Walther and I suspect that she  might be able to turn her talents to a more contemporary Bermuda story, if  she so desired.As I indicated in the title of this story, if you are a fan  of this island, this book is worth reading and I consider myself fortunate  that I have not only read the book, but met the author.

I even had a little trouble getting started with this story and had to try it  three times before I got to the point where I was easily turning the pages.  The author continues to make you think one thing is happening for a certain  reason when it is not. I have referred to this in other reviews as  &quot;illusional writing&quot;. He is a master at that. He deftly reveals  pieces of the puzzle as to why Michael Hrubek has managed to escape from  the hospital for the criminally insane where he had been sent to for  murder. As Hrubek makes his way, confounding his pursuers, ever so surely  and ever so cleverly towards the home of the woman who testified against  him at his trial, Lis Atcheson, you will think you understand what is  happening and why at numerous times. However, when you get to the end -  well - that's the whole point of a Deaver book. The ending is always a  delicious surprise...and this one - happily - is no exception.	2000-06-23

Dismas Hardy is a central character that you can admire,  identify with and root for as he contends with (1) a wife who's sense of  values is refreshing in these times which have caused her to be jailed for  contempt(2) an ambitious prosecutor and a venal DA (3) a cllient who  appears to hold at least one of the keys to his wife's jail cell (4) a  judge who holds the other key and (5) his old friend, homicide detective  Abe Glitzky as he tries to solve the problem of the murder of his client's  wife. This author has mastered the art of making conversation come alive on  the printed page and you keep turning the pages well into the night. I was  happy to be on vacation so that I could enjoy it in large doses. I  recommend it without qualification.	2000-06-13

( ) A friend who first introduced me to this author with thebook &quot;Chief's&quot; wrote to say that &quot;The Run&quot; wasvery good.  Our dogs bought it for my wife for Mother's Day and she enjoyed it. I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Woods in Arizona this winter and he seemed hopeful that the book would be well received. I therefore sat down with it holding high hopes for what awaited, especially since he had returned to his very successful character, Will Lee. As I read through it, I kept waiting, as we do when a plane is rolling down the runway with you in it, for it to leave the ground and go soaring into the sky. I finished the book a few weeks ago. I'm still waiting for lift off. The fairly negative reviews that are in here by others echo my thoughts. There are annoying factual errors and a fairly superficial treatment of a story line which had some promise, but was never dealt with seriously. Mr. Woods has developed into a very entertaining speaker these days. However, his writing continues to suffer and until the sales figures of his books begin to concern his publishers, he probably will continue to crank out these disappointing novels.  END	2000-06-13
2428010:US	52812751	R1BER703KIBUMM	0385497466	376574359	The Brethren	Books	2	0	0	N	Y	Very disappointing	Until now, you could not go wrong with a John Grisham book. John O'Hara he isn't, but his books were always interesting page turners. I can't for the life of me figure out why he wrote this one, other than to fulfill an  obligation to a publisher. There are two plots which you know will connect  at some point in time, but by that time you really don't care. &quot;The  Bretheren&quot; are three convicts who used to be judges of one kind or  another who ended up behind bars due to defects in their character which  appeared at an inopportune time in each of their lives. Given the relative  freedom of the minimum security prison they find themselves in, they are  setting about to extort money with a nasty little scam they are running on  the internet. Grisham seemed to get a lot of fun in describing how it  operated...a lot more than I enjoyed reading about it. That plot at least  was credible. The second plot was very thin gruel indeed. The head of the  CIA is concerned with a shrinking defense budget and with the inclination  of announced candidates for president to continue that practice. So he puts  the resources of the CIA to work to find the perfect candidate. One who has  no flaws, no skeletons, no baggage and that can be made electable. Once  located the candidate is advised that he will be president so long as he  sticks to the script, because the CIA can make things happen what will make  the candidate look like a prophet, and money is no problem at all. The  candidate agrees to the conditions and the story plods along, meandering in  and out until the paths of The Breatheren cross those of the candidate. The  situation is dealt with in a less than satisfactory way and the story  rather drifts to a conclusion. I cannot close this without pointing out a  glaring factual error in the book, which while not significant to the  story, shows a level of sloppiness which is all too pervasive in modern  book publishing these days. A character in the book is trying to make off  with a bunch of money and he is being hunted by the CIA. At one point the  CIA head is informed that the subject has just presented his passport at  the airport in Hamilton, Bermuda. I was in Bermuda when I read this and I  hooted out loud. Hamilton is the capital of that small island and does not  now, nor has it ever, had an airport within its confines. The airport is,  and has always been in St. George's, many kilometers to the east and is  called Kindley Field. In the distant past, Flying Boats landed and departed  from Darrell's Island in The Great Sound, but that is nothing more now than  a ruin and some distance from Hamilton on the other side of the island. We  have come to expect much more from Mr. Grisham. Alas, this time he has not  delivered.	2000-06-13

Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs return again and get into more trouble than you can possibly imagine. During the course of the book you will be convinced that Amelia will (1) go to jail for a long time (2) be murdered  on more than one occasion and (3)need to be fitted for a straight jacket.  You will also conclude at different times that Lincoln will (1) be murdered  on more than one occasion (2) has lost his touch (3) has lost Thorn. What  makes this book work is that Deaver is so capable of writing illusionally.  You are sure that you read something that makes what follows impossible.  When you go back and check you see that you filled in a blank that Mr.  Deaver didn't. This book is a maserful exercise in mystery writing. There  are times that it seems a bit tedious and confusing, but that is what the  writer intends, for reasons that you will see as you continue through it. I  do wonder why he titled it The Empty Chair, although there is a plausable  explanation for it when you link that psychological technique to what turns  out to be a very important memory by one of the characters. Read it and  enjoy the delicious attention to detail and devious turns and twists that  this writer has clearly mastered. A great read!	2000-05-25

When I read that one of the central people in this book was John Corey of Plum Island fame, I was less than thriled. However, the book hooks you quickly  at the beginning when a 747 full of dead people lands itself at Kennedy  International. Well, not everyone is dead.  There is a Libyan terrorist on  board who was being brought to the United States in handcuffs who has  managed to remain alive and also to escape from the plane, from the the  airport and embark on his Jihad. In my opinion, when the story focused on  Asad Kalil, &quot;The Lion&quot; it is an interesting and well paced read.  When it turns to John Corey, as it does in alternating chapters until the  final section of the book, the reader is asked to endure a level of  wise-cracking, needling and irreverence on the part of the former NYPD  officer that is very distracting and unnecessary. David Letterman he isn't,  but it is not for lack of effort. Notwithstanding this annoying trait that  Mr. DeMille has given Corey, the story moves along quite well as The Lion  prowls the country eliminating a series of targets for reasons that are  eventually made clear, even to those pursuing him. The last section of the  book contains surprises and the promise of another sequel. Summer is  coming. You won't regret taking this one to the beach. You could do a lot  worse - like a paperback copy of Plum Island.	2000-05-20

I thought the premise of this novel would be entertaining, satirical, and worth the price of the book. It was anything but. This is NOT a &quot;smart bomb attack on academic hypocrisy and cant&quot; as the book jacket endorsement states. This is a B-52 cluster bomb drop on the  usual attitides about men from those who wish to portray them as befuddled,  confused creatures who could perhaps survive in this world if they weren't  being constantly outsmarted and dominated by the superior sex. I was more  than disappointed by the book after being drawn in to purchasing it buy the  commercial hype that we find on this site. I think the reader's comments  here, for the most part, are a more accurate portrayal of what awaits.	2000-05-03

It appears that Richard North Patterson is going through his Mud Season period with this effort. I agree with those that point out that he is unable to write  convincingly in the mind of a woman. I agree with those who have said that  the plot of this book is confusing at times; that the characters are not  fleshed out and in the end you really don't give a damn about Stella or the  problems and issues she is dealing with. In a word, it is a tedious read. I  have usually enjoyed this writer. Many of his earlier novels were first  rate, but this is not one of them. I hope that the next effort will be more  succesful and that he gets back to the type of writing he is clearly  capable of.	2000-04-29

I have learned perhaps more than I wanted to what it  must be like to be a paraplegic (or &quot;crip&quot; as Rhyme calls  himself) , but I never tire of learning the art of forensic examination and  seeing it employed against some really, evil people. The story has just  enough about flying, one of my interests, to satisfy that yen and more than  enough of plot twists and turns to make a reader who sometimes wonders what  it would be like to be a successful novelist, to marvel at the author's  ability to write such interesting and compelling stories.

You can idle through the explanation as to how this is accomplished, because I'm not sure that the author quite got it, but it's  of no moment. They can travel...coming back in the same exact form as you  left seems to be a problem, however. That is a fact that is kept from our  intrepid adventurers, but not from the reader. This story really moves and  is full of interesting and apparently accurate information when it takes us  back to the 1350's. To read about those days from Mr.Crichton's viewpoint  makes one glad to have been born in the 20th century. The story of what is  happening back at the laboratory is not quite so compelling, but the book  certainly holds the readers interest while telling a darn good yarn. I  would give this 4 and a half stars, if half stars were available. You won't  regret having bought it.	2000-04-21

I am sure that  Clinton supporters &quot;hate&quot; to see such a well done piece in print  and being popularly received. As the sun sets on the administration of Wm.  Clinton, Peggy Noonan's summation of it's shortcomings, it's misdeeds and  indeed, it's corruption cuts through the talk of legacy and spin and lays  the whole sad experience out in the sun like the rotting fish it is. You  have no doubt surmised that I am not an admirer of this president or his  wife and you may believe that my enthusiasim for this book is motivated by  this. What has provoked my enthusiasim is the compelling case that Ms.  Noonan makes without insulting our intelligence or torturing the facts. I  invite you to read it and be the judge.	2000-04-21

The Society is still up to its usual deadly mischief, double  dealing in Washington DC is alive and well and it looks as though there is  little that can be done to stop an assassination which will sabotage the  peace process. How all of this plays out is what keeps this book humming  from start to finish.

While that was a fictionalized account of how the Allies deceived Hitler as to the location of the D Day landing, this is pure  fiction. Or is it? A CIA operative who has a strong moral code and a highly  competent professional assassin who serves a secret group made up of the  worlds movers and shakers are destined throughout the pages of the book to  end up in a confrontation that ends up raising more questions than it  settles. Entertaining writing, fast paced action, believable characters and  enough allusion to actual people or events to keep you wondering where the  fiction blends with the present day. It's a dangerous world out there;  especially if you are letting Daniel Silva describe it to you.	2000-03-17

In the beginning of this book it seems very promising. It almost seemed like after he had the malicious Zo Suade offed that he lost his train of thought. A rather air tight case of  circumstancial evidence builds against Paul Madriani's client and you wait  for a plausable explanation that it was really someone else. Suddenly he is  off to Mexico and after a series of improbable events the mystery is  solved...or is it? Borrowing heavily from Scott Thurow's Presumed Innocent,  Martini throws in a little twist at the end. To my mind it was an  unsatisfying finish to a book that showed promise. I hope this is an  aberation and that his next one will find him returning to form.	2000-02-19

Kat Bronsky, the FBI's best known and most attractive hostage negotiator finds herself in Hong Kong to address a  symposium on terrorisim when she is drawn into a a life and death struggle  with unknown forces who are causing airliners to crash. Her chance meeting  with Robert McCabe, a Pulitzer prize-winning journalist from the Washington  Post is the beginning of some deadly events beginning with the crash of a  747 that Kat is supposed to be on and the Robert is on. The plane is  brought down by a mystery weapon which blinds the pilots. Six survive the  crash and the rest of the book is given over to their trying to escape the  unknown forces that are trying to kill them because of what they have seen  and because of what they believe McCabe has stored in his computer about  them. The book sails along from encounter and escape in Viet Nam all the  way to Idaho and in so doing it is a real page turner. My only problem is  that I thought the ending was a little too pat after such a complicated  build up and it also seemed reminiscent of another book I have read. It's  still well worth your time and money. When the story is in the air, Nance  is at his best.	2000-02-18

Since reading High Flight, I have been looking forward to the return of Kirk McGarvey as he continues to &quot;do his thing&quot; in getting rid of the bad guys and saving the world for the rest of us. I was not  disappointed with White House. One sometimes thinks that McGarvey's escapes  border on The Perils of Pauline and his accomplishments would make James  Bond green with envy. The characters are well drawn, the plot is  stimulating, and, at the end of the day, the evil have been dealt with, the  corrupt have been weeded out and most of the good guys are still standing.

Hiassen may be an acquired taste to some, as you have to enjoy some very twisted people and situations, but  &quot;at the end of the day&quot; as the popular saying goes everybody  pretty much gets what they have coming to them. Twilly Spree, is Hiaasen's  latest creation to try and save Florida from the people who are trying to  pave it, defile it, sell it and replant it and I suspect we may be seeing  more of him in another book, along with the original Savior, former Florida  Governor, Clinton Tyree, otherwise known as Skink (or you can call him  captain). A new tribe of antagonists are created in this book. They are  often kinky, sometimes homocidal, always greedy and out to do their best to  feather their nests and line their pockets at the expense of the  environment and the unsuspecting. It's a great ride which will have you  chuckling and smiling from beginning to end. I hope we don't have to wait  so long for the next one.	2000-01-27

The technojargon is easy to pass over (a la Clancy)and sometimes he seems to be doing it for its own sake. Some of the chapters  are riveting and you hope for the next one to follow, sometimes to be  dissapointed. The interpersonal relationships, especially of the US flight  crews, are well done. I also have read all of the Brown books. This called  for more of a suspension of belief than most. However,if what he writes  about going on in N.Korea has anything to do with reality, and I suspect it  does, our current leadership is not going to come out anywhere near as well  as President Martindale did, and neither will the country.

At times I felt that the suspension was a bit much to ask for and even less to justify which is what, except  for one other aspect of the authors writing style, cost it one star in my  rating.     The story starts a bit slowly and confusingly, but you are soon  drawn into the dilemna that confronts the heroine and her 12 year old  daughter.     What starts as a puzzlement (why didn't I know I had 60  million dollars in a foriegn bank account) soon turns dangerous and deadly.  Someone involved with the government of the United States is using Louisa  as a pawn and that person has lots of people willing to kill anyone that is  a threat to them. Uncovering who the enemy is takes most of the novel and  involves numerous well drawn characters, some whom you love to love and  others that you love to hate.     Sabin Willet has developed a writing  style in this book that first takes you through an episode from the  perspective of a viewer and then follows with the same episode from the  point of view of one of the participants in the episode. I found this style  initially confusing and eventually time wasting .     The ending that  Willet devises makes the trk there worth the effort. It is well worth  reading and I shall look forward to his next effort.	2000-01-09

Sometimes the Courtney clan goes looking for trouble and sometimes it finds them, but throughout this book, all of the various members of the clan are in a turmoil of one kind or another to the great entertainment of  the reader.<br />While Monsoon is a sequel to Birds of Prey, it is also a  prequel to the many other books of the Courtney family that Mr. Smith wrote  some time ago, beginning with When the Lion Hunts, I believe. There should  be at least one more book to complete the time line to the Sean Courtney  era and beyond, maybe more. Tom and Dorian Courtney are worthy parts of the  Courtney lineage and they encounter, between the pages of this book, more  perils than Pauline ever thought of. The action is fairly non-stop, both on  land and on sea; the romancing is intense when it occurs; deceit and  treachery are constant companions, some bad things happen to good people  and some very bad things happen to some very bad people. No one does this  type of story better than Wilbur Smith and he still has the hop on his  fastball.	2000-01-03

I also know that I will always look at a hostage situation with much more insight and  understanding as a result of having spent 419 pages with the FBI's top  negotiator, Arthur Potter. The bad guys are really bad. One of them (Handy)  is really deviously clever. You don't ever want to be held hostage by him.  The plot twists and turns as deadlines arrive and hostages are in peril,  not only from their captors, but from some of the misguided politicians and  law enforcement folks on the good guys side. Through all of the plot  changes, Art Potter keeps his eye on the target. And just when you thought  it was over...it isn't.

I believe Wilbur Smith has written in the vicinity of 30 novels. I should go home and count them tonight as I have every one of them, and I am starting his most recent, Monsoon, this evening. My dear wife gave me his  novel, Rage, about 11 years ago and I have been hooked ever since. He  simply has never written a book that was not a delight to read and an  educational experience as well. The history of South Africa is woven  through many of his books and you will not find an easier way to learn it.  This book is a rolliking story of the sea which contains all of the  elements he weaves so effortlessly into his books. Adventure, romance, sex  (there is a difference), mystery and suspence come in many measures, all  palatable and more than enjoyable. The outline of the story has been told  by other reviews. Suffice it to say, you always get more than your money's  worth from Mr. Smith...even at today's prices!	1999-12-22

A New Song continues the delightful travel through the rest of their lives of Fr. Tim and Cynthia Kavanaugh. Those who think that the cryptic ending indicates that Fr. Tim has gone home to the Lord are in error. At least the  author says so in several interviews I have read. &quot;Why would I do  that?&quot;, she asks. The next book is to be the story of their wedding.  This was passed over rather quickly in an earlier book, but now we will get  to attend. Moving to the coast of N. Carolina from the mountains to be the  interim priest at St. John's, Fr. Tim find a church and a community much in  need of him and God's healing grace. I won't detail all of the new  characters or what has happened to some of the Mitford people. Buy it,  enyoy it, and savor the wisdom and insight that it contains.	1999-12-07

After three days I had read them both, enjoyed them thoroughly and lost much sleep. It may be trite to say that he writes  like Tom Clancy without the tedious technical explanations. It may also be  a bit innacurrate as I enjoyed him more than TC. Huston is especially good  with dialogue and these characters came alive for me.  Clinton is lucky  that Jim Dillon is a fictional character and not one of the Managers of  Impeachment. I agree with the reader who would have liked to know more  about the bad guy &quot;George Washington&quot;. The characters in the book  wanted to also as they realized the nature and extent of the armaments and  techical equipment they possessed and asked the Butch Cassidy question:  &quot;Who are these guys&quot;? I tend to agree that there will not be a  three-peat...but you may recall that they could not i.d. GW, if that was in  fact him who had his face blown off. In any event, if  political/military/action novels are of interest to you, you could not do  better than to read Mr. Huston. I am now a BIG fan!	1999-11-28

I have read all the others, but this one isn't even close to being in their league. The plot is thin, the characters are not very believeable and the result is contrived.  I hope the next one finds him returning to a better work, but I will check  it out before I just buy it on his up 'til now well deserved reputation.	1999-11-28

It was a wonderful interview and he read some of his poems and explained how the book came to be. It has always been a  secret hope of mine that I might bump into Jack some place in Maine, but it  has not happened yet. The next best thing is to own his book, and then he  can talk to you and share his vision of this unique area of our lovely  state. His talent is not limited to his high profile experiences in  television journalisim for NBC. He is an accomplished photographer and poet  and he has a wonderful heart.	1999-11-28

Richard Herman is one of my favorite authors...his first several books were page turners...but as he has gone deeper into the Potonski family...he has started to lose his edge...and this book read like it was written in a  hurry. It jumps around...has incomplete characters...predictable  sub-plots...yet it was still worth reading...but I suggest you borrow it  from someone who shelled out the cash...or wait for paperback. Hopefully he  will take a deep breath before he starts the next one, which the ending of  the book clearly portends.	1999-07-31

I love books about the airlines and flying and my threshold for criticisim of them is  very high. But this one merits it. I finished it because I kept hoping an  interesting plot twist would justify the book being published. Alas...that  was not on the Flight Path of this particular endeavor.	1999-07-12

As I started through this novel,I kept finding myself listening to the rational and sympatheituc justification for becoming a serial murderer and finding it somewhat compelling. Because the focus of the book, Burke  Devore, a downsized paper mill production manager seems otherwise normal,  even &quot;someone like us&quot;, you become caught up in the madness and  nearly find yourself tending to excuse it. Will there be a day of reckoning  for the innocent lives so callously taken?? That my friends is one of the  beauties of the book. It is unsettling reading...but it sure could happen.  I hope Mr. Westlake will return to his previous style of writing, but he  sure has proved his versatility.	1999-06-28

While far better that &quot;Dirt&quot;, one of the worst books ever published, Woods is still looking for the magic of &quot;Chiefs&quot; and some of his other earlier works. Perhaps he has really told all the good  stories he has to tell. Major Holly Barker has just resigned her commission  in the US Army because she and another woman had testified at the  courts-martial of her commanding officer, charging him with attempted rape  and sexual harrassment. The officer was acquitted. Chief Marley of Orchid  beach, a good friend of Holly's father, offers her the Deputy Chief  position in his police force. She accepts and all hell breaks loose in  Orchid Beach. The Chief is shot and later dies. His best friend, a retired  officer is also blown away. A former Miami police officer and now defense  attorney,(he relates to defendants) Jackson Oxenhandler, represents a hippy  couple whom the police believe are responsible. He springs the hapless duo  at a probable cause hearing when it becomes clear that they are not  responsible and immediately starts pursuing the rather fetching Deputy  Chief. He has her in bed in nearly record time, prompting one to wonder  that the courts-martial acquittal might have been the right result. Holly  and Jackson start teaming up in more ways than one to find the killer(s)  because she can't trust her department as there is a mole in it, according  to the former Chief. She is assisted in this by a Doberman Pincher named  Daisy (she belonged to the friend who was shot) who seems to transfer her  loyalties faster than Bill Clinton and whose best trick is to open the  refrigerator door and serve cold beer by the bottle. There is a distrustful  City Council to deal with, as well as a gated community within the  jurisdiction of Orchid Beach that is more heavily armed and guarded than a  Colombian drug cartel. Rogue cops make up the membership of the private  security force and two of them quickly become the focus of Holly's  interest. The predictable surveilance, investigation and shootout occurs  and all is well once again in Orchid Beach and Jackson and Holly can get  back to wearing out the sheets. If anyone but Woods had submitted this for  publication it would have been rejected...and so should prospective  readers.	1999-06-07

Sam Truitt who has already been burned as a college professor by sleeping with a co-ed and then giving  her a C grade, (&quot;Next time Sam, give her an A and spare me the  embarrassment&quot;, says his wife) is confirmed as a Justice of the U.S.  Supreme Court. He has hardly had a chance to try out his chair when the  Chief, a fire breathing &quot;right wing conservative&quot; advises that he  is just waiting for Sam to give his followers a chance to remove him. So,  against that background Sam hires the sexiest ex-stripper ever to graduate  from Stanford as one of his law clerks. However, she is a double agent as  she has been put up to applying to be the judge's law clerk by the  President of Atlantica Airlines (Max). He is the guy who rescued her from  her life of sin while making her his mistress. Then, during a down period  in that relationship, she was falling in love with and sleeping with the  Chief Pilot of Atlantica (Tony). Unfortunately, Tony the Pilot is at the  controls of Flight 610 when the tail engine disintegrates and the plane  crashes in The Everglades with all lives lost. A law suit is brought  against the company. It's insurance company is insolvent so the airline  will have to pay the damages, if any are awarded. Lisa, the law clerk, is  convinced by her former lover that there was a terrorist bomb on the plane  and getting &quot;her Justice&quot; to vote for the airline is the right  thing to do.(It really was lousy maintainance) Sound complicated?? You bet.  Believable?? No way!! Then throw in the Japanese Mafia being the de facto  owners of the airline and employing one of the most disgusting thugs ever  concocted to see that &quot;justice is done&quot; and you have even more  layers of disbelief to wade through. (If you make it through how he does  away with another of Sam's law clerks - you will probably finish the book)  After a while you know, that no matter how bleak the chances of Sam and  Lisa are of surviving this plot, that Super Sam, will conquer the  Everglades, the Japanese, and the vast right wing conspirators. There will  be peace in the valley again. Paul Levine's imagination was without limit  in this piece, but his failure to harness it into a believable yarn, flaws  the story beyond redemption as it becomes a caricature of the legal  thriller genre.	1998-11-09
